Considered among the greatest composers of the Renaissance, he had a profound influence on composers both from his native country and on the Continent. He is often considered along with John Dunstaple and Henry Purcell as one of England's most important composers of early music.\nByrd wrote in many of the forms current in England at the time, including various types of sacred and secular polyphony, keyboard (the so-called Virginalist school), and consort music. He produced sacred music for Anglican services, but during the 1570s became a Roman Catholic, and wrote Catholic sacred music later in his life.\nLife.\nBirth and background.\nRichard Byrd of Ingatestone, Essex, the paternal grandfather of Thomas Byrd, probably moved to London in the 15th century. Thereafter succeeding generations of the Byrd family are described as gentlemen.\nWilliam Byrd was probably born in London, the third surviving son of Thomas Byrd and his wife, Margery. No record of his birth has survived, and the year of his birth is not known for certain, but a document dated 2 October 1598, and written by William Byrd, states that he is \"58 yeares or ther abouts\", making the year he was born to be 1539 or 1540. Byrd's will of November 1622 provides a later date for his birth, as in it Byrd states that he was then in the \"80th year of mine age\". The historian Kerry McCarthy has suggested that discrepancy over these dates may have been due to the will not being kept up to date over a period of several years.\nByrd was born into a musical and relatively wealthy family. He had two older brothers, Symond and John, who became London merchants and active members of their respective livery companies. One of his four sisters, Barbara, was married to a maker of musical instruments who kept a shop; his three other sisters, Martha, Mary and Alice, were probably also married to merchants.\nYouth and early career.\nDetails of Byrd's childhood are speculative. There is no documentary evidence concerning Byrd's education or early musical training. His two brothers were choristers at St. Paul's Cathedral, and Byrd may have been a chorister there as well, although it is possible that he was a chorister with the Chapel Royal. According to Anthony Wood, Byrd was \"bred up to musick under Tho. Tallis\", and a reference in the \"Cantiones sacrae\", published by Byrd and Thomas Tallis in 1575, tends to confirm that Byrd was a pupil of Tallis in the Chapel Royal. If he was\u2014and conclusive evidence has not emerged to verify it\u2014it seems likely that once Byrd's voice broke, the boy stayed on at the Chapel Royal as Tallis's assistant.\nByrd produced student compositions, including \"Sermone Blando\" for consort, and a \"Miserere\". Church music for the Catholic rite reintroduced by Mary would have been composed before her death in 1558, which occurred when Byrd was eighteen. His early compositions suggest he was taught polyphony when a student.\nLincoln.\nByrd's first known professional employment was his appointment in 1563 as organist and master of the choristers at Lincoln Cathedral. Residing at what is now 6 Minster Yard Lincoln, he remained in post until 1572. His period at Lincoln was not entirely trouble-free, for on 19 November 1569 the Dean and Chapter cited him for 'certain matters alleged against him' as the result of which his salary was suspended. Since Puritanism was influential at Lincoln, it is possible that the allegations were connected with over-elaborate choral polyphony or organ playing. A second directive, dated 29 November, issued detailed instructions regarding Byrd's use of the organ in the liturgy. \nOn 14 September 1568, Byrd was married in the church of St Margaret-in-the-Close, Lincoln. His wife, Juliana, came from the Birley family of Lincolnshire. The baptism records mention two of their children, Christopher and Elizabeth, but the marriage produced at least seven children. Thomas Byrd, likely the second son of William Byrd, appears as the godson of Thomas Tallis in Tallis' will.\nThe Chapel Royal.\nIn 1572, following the death of the composer Robert Parsons, who drowned in the Trent near Newark on 25 January of that year, Byrd obtained the post of Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, the largest choir of its kind in England. The appointment, which was for life, came with a good salary. Almost from the outset Byrd is named as 'organist', which however was not a designated post but an occupation for any Chapel Royal member capable of filling it. \nIn 1575 Byrd and Tallis were jointly granted a monopoly for the printing of music and ruled music paper for 21 years, one of a number of patents issued by the Crown for the printing of books, which was the first known issuing of letters patent. The two musicians used the services of the French Huguenot printer Thomas Vautrollier, who had settled in England and previously produced an edition of a collection of Lassus chansons in London (\"\", 1570). \nThe two monopolists took advantage of the patent to produce a grandiose joint publication under the title \"Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur\". It was a collection of 34 Latin motets dedicated to the Queen herself, accompanied by elaborate prefatory matter including poems in Latin elegiacs by the schoolmaster Richard Mulcaster and the young courtier Ferdinand Heybourne (aka Richardson) who was also a pupil of Tallis. There are 17 motets each by Tallis and Byrd, one for each year of the Queen's reign.\nThe \"Cantiones\" were a financial failure. In 1577 Byrd and Tallis were forced to petition Queen Elizabeth for financial help, pleading that the publication had \"fallen oute to oure greate losse\" and that Tallis was now \"verie aged\". They were subsequently granted the leasehold on various lands in East Anglia and the West Country for a period of 21 years. Thomas Byrd inherited his half of the monopoly from his godfather, Tallis in 1585: although it is assumed that it was William Byrd who eventually managed it or was given ownership to continue the production of vast publications.\nCatholicism.\nFrom the early 1570s onwards Byrd became increasingly involved with Catholicism, which, as the scholarship of the last half-century has demonstrated, became a major factor in his personal and creative life. As John Harley has shown, it is probable that Byrd's parental family were Protestants, though whether by deeply felt conviction or nominal conformism is not clear. Byrd himself may have held Protestant beliefs in his youth, for a recently discovered fragment of a setting of an English translation of Martin Luther's hymn \"\", which bears an attribution to \"Birde\" includes the line \"From Turk and Pope defend us Lord\". However, from the 1570s onwards he is found associating with known Catholics, including Lord Thomas Paget, to whom he wrote a petitionary letter on behalf of an unnamed friend in about 1573. Paget's household itself was a musical centre where \"songes of Mr Byrdes and Mr Tallys were sung\", implying that both composers were involved there in some way to permit the use of their music. Byrd's wife Julian was first cited for recusancy (refusing to attend Anglican services) at Harlington in Middlesex, where the family then lived, in 1577. Byrd himself appears in the recusancy lists from 1584.\nHis involvement with Catholicism took on a new dimension in the 1580s. Following Pope Pius V's papal bull \"Regnans in Excelsis\", in 1570, which absolved Elizabeth's subjects from allegiance to her and effectively made her an outlaw in the eyes of the Catholic Church, Catholicism became increasingly identified with sedition in the eyes of the Tudor authorities. With the influx of missionary priests trained at the English College, Douai (now in France but then part of the Spanish Netherlands), and in Rome from the 1570s onwards, relations between the authorities and the Catholic community took a further turn for the worse. Byrd himself is found in the company of prominent Catholics. In 1583 he got into serious trouble because of his association with Paget, who was suspected of involvement in the Throckmorton Plot, and for sending money to Catholics abroad. As a result of this, Byrd's membership of the Chapel Royal was apparently suspended for a time, restrictions were placed on his movements, and his house was placed on the search list. In 1586 he attended a gathering at a country house in the company of Father Henry Garnett (later executed for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot) and the Catholic poet Robert Southwell.\nStondon Massey.\nIn about 1594 Byrd's career entered a new phase. He was now in his early fifties, and seems to have gone into semi-retirement from the Chapel Royal. He moved with his family from Harlington to Stondon Massey, a small village near Chipping Ongar in Essex. His ownership of Stondon Place, where he lived for the rest of his life, was contested by Joanna Shelley, with whom he engaged in a legal dispute lasting about a decade and a half. The main reason for the move was apparently the proximity of Byrd's patron Sir John Petre, son of Sir William Petre. A wealthy local landowner, Petre was a discreet Catholic who maintained two local manor houses, Ingatestone Hall and Thorndon Hall, the first of which still survives in a much-altered state (the latter has been rebuilt). Petre held clandestine Mass celebrations, with music provided by his servants, which were subject to the unwelcome attention of spies and paid informers working for the Crown.\nByrd's acquaintance with the Petre family extended back at least to 1581 (as his surviving autograph letter of that year shows) and he spent two weeks at the Petre household over Christmas in 1589. He was ideally equipped to provide elaborate polyphony to adorn the music making at the Catholic country houses of the time. The ongoing adherence of Byrd and his family to Catholicism continued to cause him difficulties, though a surviving reference to a lost petition apparently written by Byrd to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury sometime between 1605 and 1612 suggests that he had been allowed to practise his religion under licence during the reign of Elizabeth. Nevertheless, he regularly appeared in the quarterly local assizes and was reported to the archdeaconry court for non-attendance at the parish church. He was required to pay heavy fines for recusancy.\nLater years and death.\nDuring his later years Byrd also added to his output of consort songs, a number of which were discovered by Philip Brett and Thurston Dart when Brett was a university student in the early 1960s. They probably reflect Byrd's relationship with the Norfolk landowner and music-lover Sir Edward Paston (1550\u20131630) who may have written some of the poems. The songs include elegies for public figures such as the Earl of Essex (1601), the Catholic matriarch and viscountess Montague Magdalen Dacre (\"With Lilies White\", 1608) and Henry Prince of Wales (1612). Others refer to local notabilities or incidents from the Norfolk area.\nByrd remained in Stondon Massey until his death, due to heart failure, on 4 July 1623, which was noted in the Chapel Royal Check Book in a unique entry describing him as \"a Father of Musick\". Despite repeated citations for recusancy and persistent heavy fines, he died a rich man, having rooms at the time of his death at the London home of the Earl of Worcester.\nMusic.\nDuring his lifetime, Byrd published three volumes of \"Cantiones Sacrae\" (1575, co-written with Tallis; 1589; 1591), two volumes of \"Gradualia\" (1605; 1607), \"Psalmes, Sonets, and Songs of Sadnes and Pietie\" (1588), \"Songs of Sundrie Natures\" (1589), and \"Psalmes, Songs, and Sonnets\" (1611). He also composed other vocal and instrumental pieces; three Masses, music for the \"Fitzwilliam Virginal Book\", and motets.\nEarly compositions.\nOne of Byrd's earliest compositions was a collaboration with two Chapel Royal singing-men, John Sheppard and William Mundy, on a setting for four male voices of the psalm \"In exitu Israel\" for the procession to the font in Easter week. It was probably composed near the end of the reign of Queen Mary Tudor (1553\u20131558), who revived Sarum liturgical practices.\nA few other compositions by Byrd also probably date from his teenage years. These include his setting of the Easter responsory \"Christus resurgens\" (a4) which was not published until 1605, but which as part of the Sarum liturgy could also have been composed during Mary's reign, as well as \"Alleluia confitemini\" (a3) which combines two liturgical items for Easter week. Some of the hymns and antiphons for keyboard and for consort may also date from this period, though it is also possible that the consort pieces may have been composed in Lincoln for the musical training of choirboys.\nThe 1560s were also important formative years for Byrd the composer. His \"Short Service\", an unpretentious setting of items for the Anglican Matins, Communion and Evensong services, which seems to have been designed to comply with the Protestant reformers' demand for clear words and simple musical textures, may well have been composed during the Lincoln years. It is at any rate clear that Byrd was composing Anglican church music, for when he left Lincoln the Dean and Chapter continued to pay him at a reduced rate on condition that he would send the cathedral his compositions. Byrd had also taken serious strides with instrumental music. The seven \"In Nomine\" settings for consort (two a4 and five a5), at least one of the consort fantasias (\"Neighbour\" F1 a6) and a number of important keyboard works were apparently composed during the Lincoln years. The latter include the \"Ground in Gamut\" (described as \"Mr Byrd's old ground\") by his future pupil Thomas Tomkins, the A minor Fantasia, and probably the first of Byrd's great series of keyboard pavanes and galliards, a composition which was transcribed by Byrd from an original for five-part consort. All these show Byrd gradually emerging as a major figure on the Elizabethan musical landscape.\nSome sets of keyboard variations, such as \"The Hunt's Up\" and the imperfectly preserved set on \"Gypsies' Round\" also seem to be early works. As we have seen, Byrd had begun setting Latin liturgical texts as a teenager, and he seems to have continued to do so at Lincoln. Two exceptional large-scale psalm motets, \"Ad Dominum cum tribularer\" (a8) and \"Domine quis habitabit\" (a9), are Byrd's contribution to a paraliturgical form cultivated by Robert White and Parsons. \"De lamentatione\", another early work, is a contribution to the Elizabethan practice of setting groups of verses from the \"Lamentations of Jeremiah\", following the format of the \"Tenebrae\" lessons sung in the Catholic rite during the last three days of Holy Week. Other contributors in this form include Tallis, White, Parsons and the elder Ferrabosco. It is likely that this practice was an expression of Elizabethan Catholic nostalgia, as a number of the texts suggest.\n\"Cantiones sacrae\" (1575).\nByrd's contributions to the \"Cantiones\" are in various different styles, although his forceful musical personality is stamped on all of them. The inclusion of \"Laudate pueri\" (a6), believed by Joseph Kerman to have been originally composed as a instrumental fantasia, is one sign that Byrd had some difficulty in assembling enough material for the collection. However, Andrew Carwood speculates that Tallis' \"Laudate Dominum Omnes Gentes\" (in the Baldwin Partbooks) served as a model for Byrd's \"Laudate Pueri\", giving \"Laudate Pueri\" a purely choral provenence. \"Diliges Dominum\" (a8), which may also originally have been untexted, is an eight-in-four retrograde canon of little musical interest. Also belonging to the more archaic stratum of motets is \"Libera me Domine\" (a5), a \"cantus firmus\" setting of the ninth responsory at Matins for the Office for the Dead, which takes its point of departure from the setting by Parsons, while \"Miserere mihi\" (a6), a setting of a Compline antiphon often used by Tudor composers for didactic \"cantus firmus\" exercises, incorporates a four-in-two canon. \"Tribue Domine\" (a6) is a large-scale sectional composition setting from a medieval collection of \"Meditationes\" which was commonly attributed to St Augustine, composed in a style which owes much to early Tudor settings of antiphons as a mosaic of full and semichoir passages. Byrd sets it in three sections, each beginning with a semichoir passage in the archaic English votive style.\nByrd's contribution to the \"Cantiones\" also includes compositions in a more forward-looking manner which point the way to his motets of the 1580s. Some of them show the influence of the motets of Ferrabosco I, a Bolognese musician who worked in the Tudor court at intervals between 1562 and 1578. Ferrabosco's motets provided direct models for Byrd's \"Emendemus in melius\" (a5), \"O lux beata Trinitas\" (a6), \"Domine secundum actum meum\" (a6) and \"Siderum rector\" (a5) as well as a more generalised paradigm for what Kerman has called Byrd's 'affective-imitative' style, a method of setting pathetic texts in extended paragraphs based on subjects employing curving lines in fluid rhythm and contrapuntal techniques which Byrd learnt from his study of Ferrabosco.\n\"Cantiones sacrae\" (1589 and 1591).\nByrd's commitment to the Catholic cause found expression in his motets, of which he composed about 50 between 1575 and 1591. While the texts of the motets included by Byrd and Tallis in the 1575 \"Cantiones\" have a High Anglican doctrinal tone, scholars such as Joseph Kerman have detected a profound change of direction in the texts which Byrd set in the motets of the 1580s. In particular there is a persistent emphasis on themes such as the persecution of the chosen people (\"Domine praestolamur\" a5) the Babylonian or Egyptian captivity (\"Domine tu iurasti\") and the long-awaited coming of deliverance (\"Laetentur caeli\", \"Circumspice Jerusalem\"). This has led scholars from Kerman onwards to believe that Byrd was reinterpreting biblical and liturgical texts in a contemporary context and writing laments and petitions on behalf of the persecuted Catholic community, which seems to have adopted Byrd as a kind of 'house' composer. Some texts should probably be interpreted as warnings against spies (\"Vigilate, nescitis enim\") or lying tongues (\"Quis est homo\") or celebration of the memory of martyred priests (\"O quam gloriosum\"). Byrd's setting of the first four verses of Psalm 78 (\"Deus venerunt gentes\") is widely believed to refer to the brutal execution of Fr Edmund Campion in 1581 an event that caused widespread revulsion on the Continent as well as in England. Finally, and perhaps most remarkably, Byrd's \"Quomodo cantabimus\" is the result of a motet exchange between Byrd and Philippe de Monte, who was director of music to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, in Prague. In 1583 De Monte sent Byrd his setting of verses 1\u20134 of Vulgate Psalm 136 (\"Super flumina Babylonis\"), including the pointed question \"How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?\" Byrd replied the following year with a setting of the defiant continuation, set, like de Monte's piece, in eight parts and incorporating a three-part canon by inversion.\nThirty-seven of Byrd's motets were published in two sets of \"Cantiones sacrae\", which appeared in 1589 and 1591. Together with two sets of English songs, discussed below, these collections, dedicated to powerful Elizabethan lords (Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester and John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley), probably formed part of Byrd's campaign to re-establish himself in Court circles after the reverses of the 1580s. They may also reflect the fact that Byrd's fellow monopolist Tallis and his printer Thomas Vautrollier had died, thus creating a more propitious climate for publishing ventures. Since many of the motet texts of the 1589 and 1591 sets are pathetic in tone, it is not surprising that many of them continue and develop the 'affective-imitative' vein found in some motets from the 1570s, though in a more concise and concentrated form. \"Domine praestolamur\" (1589) is a good example of this style, laid out in imitative paragraphs based on subjects which characteristically emphasise the expressive minor second and minor sixth, with continuations which subsequently break off and are heard separately (another technique which Byrd had learnt from his study of Ferrabosco). Byrd evolved a special \"cell\" technique for setting the petitionary clauses such as \"miserere mei\" or \"libera nos Domine\" which form the focal point for a number of the texts. Particularly striking examples of these are the final section of \"Tribulatio proxima est\" (1589) and the multi-sectional \"Infelix ego\" (1591), a large-scale motet which takes its point of departure from \"Tribue Domine\" of 1575.\nThere are also a number of compositions which do not conform to this stylistic pattern. They include three motets which employ the old-fashioned cantus firmus technique as well as the most famous item in the 1589 collection, \"Ne irascaris Domine\". the second part of which is closely modelled on Philip van Wilder's popular \"Aspice Domine\". A few motets, especially in the 1591 set, abandon traditional motet style and resort to vivid word painting which reflects the growing popularity of the madrigal (\"Haec dies\", \"Laudibus in sanctis\", 1591). A famous passage from Thomas Morley's \"A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke\" (1597) supports the view that the madrigal had superseded the motet in the favour of Catholic patrons, a fact which may explain why Byrd composed few non-liturgical motets after 1591.\nAnglican church music.\nByrd's staunch adherence to Catholicism did not prevent him from contributing memorably to the repertory of Anglican church music. Byrd's small output of church anthems ranges in style from relatively sober early examples (\"O Lord, make thy servant Elizabeth our queen\" (a6) and \"How long shall mine enemies\" (a5) ) to other, evidently late works such as \"Sing joyfully\" (a6) which is close in style to the English motets of Byrd's 1611 set, discussed below. Byrd also played a role in the emergence of the new verse anthem, which seems to have evolved in part from the practice of adding vocal refrains to consort songs. Byrd's four Anglican service settings range in style from the unpretentious Short Service, already discussed, to the magnificent so-called Great Service, a grandiose work which continues a tradition of opulent settings by Richard Farrant, William Mundy and Parsons. Byrd's setting is on a massive scale, requiring five-part \"Decani\" and \"Cantoris\" groupings in antiphony, block homophony and five, six and eight-part counterpoint with verse (solo) sections for added variety. This service setting, which includes an organ part, must have been sung by the Chapel Royal Choir on major liturgical occasions in the early seventeenth century, though its limited circulation suggests that many other cathedral choirs must have found it beyond them. Nevertheless, the source material shows that it was sung in York Minster as well as Durham, Worcester and Cambridge, in the early seventeenth century. The Great Service was in existence by 1606 (the last copying date entered in the so-called Baldwin Commonplace Book) and may date back as far as the 1590s; Tallis' earlier setting for the Benedictus is quoted in Byrd's own Benedictus for the Great Service. Kerry McCarthy has pointed out that the York Minster manuscript of the Great Service was copied by a vicar-choral named John Todd, apparently between 1597 and 1599, and is described as 'Mr Byrd's new sute of service for means'. This suggests the possibility that the work may have been Byrd's next compositional project after the three Mass settings.\nThe English song-books of 1588 and 1589.\nIn 1588 and 1589 Byrd also published two collections of English songs. The first, \"Psalms, Sonnets and Songs of Sadness and Pietie\" (1588), contains the first madrigals published in England. It consists mainly of adapted consort songs, which Byrd, probably guided by commercial instincts, had turned into vocal part-songs by adding words to the accompanying instrumental parts and labelling the original solo voice as \"the first singing part\". The consort song, which was the most popular form of vernacular polyphony in England in the third quarter of the sixteenth century, was a solo song for a high voice (often sung by a boy) accompanied by a consort of four consort instruments (normally viols). As the title of Byrd's collection implies, consort songs varied widely in character. Many were settings of metrical psalms, in which the solo voice sings a melody in the manner of the numerous metrical psalm collections of the day (e.g. \"Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter\", 1562) with each line prefigured by imitation in the accompanying instruments. Others are dramatic elegies, intended to be performed in the boy-plays which were popular in Tudor London. A popular source for song settings was Richard Edwards' \"The paradyse of dainty devices\" (1576) of which seven settings in consort song form survive.\nByrd's 1588 collection, which complicates the form as he inherited it from Parsons, Richard Farrant and others, reflects this tradition. The \"psalms\" section sets texts drawn from Sternhold's psalter of 1549 in the traditional manner, while the 'sonnets and pastorals' section employs lighter, more rapid motion with crotchet (quarter-note) pulse, and sometimes triple metre (\"Though Amaryllis dance in green, If women could be fair\"). Poetically, the set (together with other evidence) reflects Byrd's involvement with the literary circle surrounding Sir Philip Sidney, whose influence at Court was at its height in the early 1580s. Byrd set three of the songs from Sidney's sonnet sequence \"Astrophel and Stella\", as well as poems by other members of the Sidney circle, and also included two elegies on Sidney's death in the Battle of Zutphen in 1586. But the most popular item in the set was the Lullaby (\"Lullay lullaby\") which blends the tradition of the dramatic lament with the cradle-songs found in some early boy-plays and medieval mystery plays. It long retained its popularity. In 1602, Byrd's patron Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester, discussing Court fashions in music, predicted that \"in winter lullaby, an owld song of Mr Birde, wylbee more in request as I thinke.\"\nThe \"Songs of Sundrie Natures\" (1589) contain sections in three, four, five and six parts, a format which follows the plan of many Tudor manuscript collections of household music and was probably intended to emulate the madrigal collection Musica transalpina, which had appeared in print the previous year. Byrd's set contains compositions in a wide variety of musical styles, reflecting the variegated character of the texts which he was setting. The three-part section includes settings of metrical versions of the seven penitential psalms, in an archaic style which reflects the influence of the psalm collections. Other items from the three-part and four-part section are in a lighter vein, employing a line-by-line imitative technique and a predominant crotchet pulse (\"The nightingale so pleasant (a3), Is love a boy? (a4)\"). The five-part section includes vocal part-songs which show the influence of the \"adapted consort song\" style of the 1588 set but which seem to have been conceived as all-vocal part-songs. Byrd also bowed to tradition by setting two carols in the traditional form with alternating verses and burdens, (\"From Virgin's womb this day did spring, An earthly tree, a heavenly fruit, both a6\") and even included an \"anthem\", a setting of the Easter prose \"Christ rising again\" which also circulated in church choir manuscripts with organ accompaniment.\n\"My Ladye Nevells Booke\".\nThe 1580s were also a productive decade for Byrd as a composer of instrumental music. On 11 September 1591 John Baldwin, a tenor lay-clerk at St George's Chapel, Windsor and later a colleague of Byrd in the Chapel Royal, completed the copying of \"My Ladye Nevells Booke\", a collection of 42 of Byrd's keyboard pieces, which was probably produced under Byrd's supervision and includes corrections which are thought to be in the composer's hand. Byrd would almost certainly have published it if the technical means had been available to do so. The dedicatee long remained unidentified, but John Harley's researches into the heraldic design on the fly-leaf have shown that she was Lady Elizabeth Neville, the third wife of Sir Henry Neville of Billingbear House, Berkshire, who was a justice of the peace and a warden of Windsor Great Park. Under her third married name, Lady Periam, she also received the dedication of Thomas Morley's two-part canzonets of 1595. The contents show Byrd's mastery of a wide variety of keyboard forms, though liturgical compositions based on plainsong are not represented. The collection includes a series of ten pavans and galliards in the usual three-strain form with embellished repeats of each strain. (The only exception is the Ninth Pavan, which is a set of variations on the passamezzo antico bass.)\nThere are indications that the sequence may be a chronological one, for the First Pavan is labelled \"the first that ever hee made\" in the \"Fitzwilliam Virginal Book\", and the Tenth Pavan, which is separated from the others, evidently became available at a late stage before the completion date. It is dedicated to William Petre (the son of Byrd's patron Sir John Petre, 1st Baron Petre) who was only 15 years old in 1591 and could hardly have played it if it had been composed much earlier. The collection also includes two famous pieces of programme music. \"The Battle\", which was apparently inspired by an unidentified skirmish in Elizabeth's Irish wars, is a sequence of movements bearing titles such as \"The marche to fight\", \"The battells be joyned\" and \"The Galliarde for the victorie\". Although not representing Byrd at his most profound, it achieved great popularity and is of incidental interest for the information which it gives on sixteenth-century English military calls. It is followed by \"The Barley Break\" (a mock-battle follows a real one), a light-hearted piece which follows the progress of a game of \"barley-break\", a version of the game now known as \"piggy in the middle\", played by three couples with a ball. \"My Ladye Nevells Booke\" also contains two monumental Grounds, and sets of keyboard variations of variegated character, notably the huge set on \"Walsingham\" and the popular variations on \"Sellinger's Round\", \"Carman's Whistle\" and \"My Lord Willoughby's Welcome Home\". The fantasias and voluntaries in Nevell also cover a wide stylistic range, some being austerely contrapuntal (\"A voluntarie\", no. 42) and others lighter and more Italianate in tone. (\"A Fancie\" no 36). Like the five-and six-part consort fantasias, they sometimes feature a gradual increase in momentum after an imitative opening paragraph.\nConsort music.\nThe period up to 1591 also saw important additions to Byrd's output of consort music, some of which have probably been lost. Two magnificent large-scale compositions are the \"Browning\", a set of 20 variations on a popular melody (also known as \"The leaves be green\") which evidently originated as a celebration of the ripening of nuts in autumn, and an elaborate ground on the formula known as the \"Goodnight Ground\". The smaller-scale fantasias (those a3 and a4) use a light-textured imitative style which owes something to Continental models, while the five and six-part fantasias employ large-scale cumulative construction and allusions to snatches of popular songs. A good example of the last type is the \"Fantasia a6 (No 2)\" which begins with a sober imitative paragraph before progressively more fragmented textures (working in a quotation from \"Greensleeves\" at one point). It even includes a complete three-strain galliard, followed by an expansive coda (for a performance on YouTube, see under 'External links' below). The single five-part fantasia, which is apparently an early work, includes a canon at the upper fourth.\nMasses.\nByrd now embarked on a programme to provide a cycle of liturgical music covering all the principal feasts of the Catholic Church calendar. The first stage in this undertaking comprised the three Ordinary of the Mass cycles (in four, three and five parts), which were published by Thomas East between 1592 and 1595. The editions are undated (dates can be established only by close bibliographic analysis), do not name the printer and consist of only one bifolium per partbook to aid concealment, reminders that the possession of heterodox books was still highly dangerous. All three works contain retrospective features harking back to the earlier Tudor tradition of Mass settings which had lapsed after 1558, along with others which reflect Continental influence and the liturgical practices of the foreign-trained incoming missionary priests. \"Mass for Four Voices\", or the Four-Part Mass, which according to Joseph Kerman was probably the first to be composed, is partly modelled on John Taverner's \"Mean Mass\", a highly regarded early Tudor setting which Byrd would probably have sung as a choirboy. Taverner's influence is particularly clear in the scale figures rising successively through a fifth, a sixth and a seventh in Byrd's setting of the \"Sanctus\".\nAll three Mass cycles employ other early Tudor features, notably the mosaic of semichoir sections alternating with full sections in the four-part and five-part Masses, the use of a semichoir section to open the \"Gloria\", \"Credo\", and \"Agnus Dei\", and the head-motif which links the openings of all the movements of a cycle. However, all three cycles also include \"Kyrie\"s, a rare feature in Sarum Rite Mass settings, which usually omitted it because of the use of tropes on festal occasions in the Sarum Rite. The \"Kyrie\" of the three-part Mass is set in a simple litany-like style, but the other \"Kyrie\" settings employ dense imitative polyphony. A special feature of the four-part and five-part Masses is Byrd's treatment of the \"Agnus Dei\", which employ the technique which Byrd had previously applied to the petitionary clauses from the motets of the 1589 and 1591 \"Cantiones sacrae\". The final words \"dona nobis pacem\" (\"grant us peace\"), which are set to chains of anguished suspensions in the Four-Part Mass and expressive block homophony in the five-part setting, almost certainly reflect the aspirations of the troubled Catholic community of the 1590s.\nGradualia.\nThe second stage in Byrd's programme of liturgical polyphony is formed by the \"Gradualia\", two cycles of motets containing 109 items and published in 1605 and 1607. They are dedicated to two members of the Catholic nobility, Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton and Byrd's own patron Sir John Petre, who had been elevated to the peerage in 1603 under the title Lord Petre of Writtle. The appearance of these two monumental collections of Catholic polyphony reflects the hopes which the recusant community must have harboured for an easier life under the new king James I, whose mother, Mary Queen of Scots, had been a Catholic. Addressing Petre (who is known to have lent him money to advance the printing of the collection), Byrd describes the contents of the 1607 set as \"blooms collected in your own garden and rightfully due to you as tithes\", thus making explicit the fact that they had formed part of Catholic religious observances in the Petre household.\nThe greater part of the two collections consists of settings of the \"Proprium Missae\" for the major feasts of the church calendar, thus supplementing the Mass Ordinary cycles which Byrd had published in the 1590s. Normally, Byrd includes the \"Introit\", the Gradual, the \"Alleluia\" (or Tract in Lent if needed), the Offertory and Communion. The feasts covered include the major feasts of the Virgin Mary (including the votive masses for the Virgin for the four seasons of the church year), All Saints and \"Corpus Christi\" (1605) followed by the feasts of the \"Temporale\" (Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Ascension, Whitsun, and Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (with additional items for St Peter's Chains and the Votive Mass of the Blessed Sacrament) in 1607. The verse of the \"Introit\" is normally set as a semichoir section, returning to full choir scoring for the \"Gloria Patri\". Similar treatment applies to the Gradual verse, which is normally attached to the opening \"Alleluia\" to form a single item. The liturgy requires repeated settings of the word \"Alleluia\", and Byrd provides a wide variety of different settings forming brilliantly conceived miniature fantasias which are one of the most striking features of the two sets. The \"Alleluia\" verse, together with the closing \"Alleluia\", normally form an item in themselves, while the Offertory and the Communion are set as they stand.\nIn the Roman liturgy there are many texts which appear repeatedly in different liturgical contexts. To avoid having to set the same text twice, Byrd often resorted to a cross-reference or \"transfer\" system which allowed a single setting to be slotted into a different place in the liturgy. This practice sometimes causes confusion, partly because normally no rubrics are printed to make the required transfer clear and partly because there are some errors which complicate matters still further. A good example of the transfer system in operation is provided by the first motet from the 1605 set (\"Suscepimus Deus\" a5) in which the text used for the \"Introit\" has to be reused in a shortened form for the Gradual. Byrd provides a cadential break at the cut-off point.\nThe 1605 set also contains a number of miscellaneous items which fall outside the liturgical scheme of the main body of the set. As Philip Brett has pointed out, most of the items from the four- and three-part sections were taken from the Primer (the English name for the \"Book of hours\"), thus falling within the sphere of private devotions rather than public worship. These include, \"inter alia\", settings of the four Marian antiphons from the Roman Rite, four Marian hymns set a3, a version of the Litany, the gem-like setting of the Eucharistic hymn \"Ave verum Corpus\", and the \"Turbarum voces\" from the St John Passion, as well as a series of miscellaneous items.\nIn stylistic terms the motets of the \"Gradualia\" form a sharp contrast to those of the \"Cantiones sacrae\" publications. The vast majority are shorter, with the discursive imitative paragraphs of the earlier motets giving place to double phrases in which the counterpoint, though intricate and concentrated, assumes a secondary level of importance. Long imitative paragraphs are the exception, often kept for final climactic sections in the minority of extended motets. The melodic writing often breaks into quaver (eighth-note) motion, tending to undermine the minim (half-note) pulse with surface detail. Some of the more festive items, especially in the 1607 set, feature vivid madrigalesque word-painting. The Marian hymns from the 1605 \"Gradualia\" are set in a light line-by-line imitative counterpoint with crotchet pulse which recalls the three-part English songs from Songs of sundrie natures (1589). For obvious reasons, the \"Gradualia\" never achieved the popularity of Byrd's earlier works. The 1607 set omits several texts, which were evidently too sensitive for publication in the light of the renewed anti-Catholic persecution which followed the failure of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. A contemporary account which sheds light on the circulation of the music between Catholic country houses, refers to the arrest of a young Frenchman named Charles de Ligny, who was followed from an unidentified country house by spies, apprehended, searched and found to be carrying a copy of the 1605 set. Nevertheless, Byrd felt safe enough to reissue both sets with new title pages in 1610\nPsalms, songs and sonnets (1611).\nByrd's last collection of English songs was\" Psalms, Songs and Sonnets\", published in 1611 (when Byrd was over 70) and dedicated to Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland, who later also received the dedication of Thomas Campion's\" First Book of Songs\" in about 1613. The layout of the set broadly follows the pattern of Byrd's 1589 set, being laid out in sections for three, four, five and six parts like its predecessor and embracing an even wider miscellany of styles (perhaps reflecting the influence of another Jacobean publication, Michael East's \"Third Set of Books\" (1610)). Byrd's set includes two consort fantasias (a4 and a6) as well as eleven English motets, most of them setting prose texts from the Bible. These include some of his most famous compositions, notably \"Praise our Lord, all ye Gentiles\" (a6), \"This day Christ was born\" (a6) and \"Have mercy upon me\" (a6), which employs alternating phrases with verse and full scoring and was circulated as a church anthem. There are more carols set in verse and burden form as in the 1589 set as well as lighter three- and four-part songs in Byrd's \"sonnets and pastorals\" style. Some items are, however, more tinged with madrigalian influence than their counterparts in the earlier set, making clear that the short-lived madrigal vogue of the 1590s had not completely passed Byrd by. Many of the songs follow, and develop further, types already established in the 1589 collection.\nLast works.\nByrd also contributed eight keyboard pieces to \"Parthenia\" (winter 1612\u201313), a collection of 21 keyboard pieces engraved by William Hole, and containing music by Byrd, John Bull and Orlando Gibbons. It was issued in celebration of the forthcoming marriage of James I's daughter Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, which took place on 14 February 1613. The three composers are nicely differentiated by seniority, with Byrd, Bull and Gibbons represented respectively by eight, seven and six items. Byrd's contribution includes the famous \"Earle of Salisbury Pavan\", composed in memory of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, who had died on 24 May 1612, and its two accompanying galliards. Byrd's last published compositions are four English anthems printed in Sir William Leighton's \"Teares or Lamentacions of a Sorrowfull Soule\" (1614).\nLegacy.\nByrd's output of about 470 compositions amply justifies his reputation as one of the great masters of European Renaissance music. Perhaps his most impressive achievement as a composer was his ability to transform so many of the main musical forms of his day and stamp them with his own identity. Having grown up in an age in which Latin polyphony was largely confined to liturgical items for the Sarum rite, he assimilated and mastered the Continental motet form of his day, employing a highly personal synthesis of English and continental models. He virtually created the Tudor consort and keyboard fantasia, having only the most primitive models to follow. He also raised the consort song, the church anthem and the Anglican service setting to new heights. Finally, despite a general aversion to the madrigal, he succeeded in cultivating secular vocal music in an impressive variety of forms in his three sets of 1588, 1589 and 1611.\nByrd enjoyed a high reputation among English musicians. As early as 1575 Richard Mulcaster and Ferdinand Haybourne praised Byrd, together with Tallis, in poems published in the Tallis/Byrd \"Cantiones\". Despite the financial failure of the publication, some of his other collections sold well, while Elizabethan scribes such as the Oxford academic Robert Dow, Baldwin, and a school of scribes working for the Norfolk country gentleman Sir Edward Paston copied his music extensively. Dow included Latin distichs and quotations in praise of Byrd in his manuscript collection of music, the Dow Partbooks (GB Och 984\u2013988), while Baldwin included a long doggerel poem in his Commonplace Book (GB Lbm Roy App 24 d 2) ranking Byrd at the head of the musicians of his day:\nYet let not straingers bragg, nor they these soe commende,\nFor they may now geve place and sett themselves behynde,\nAn Englishman, by name, William BIRDE for his skill\nWhich I shoulde heve sett first, for soe it was my will,\nWhose greater skill and knowledge dothe excelle all at this time\nAnd far to strange countries abrode his skill dothe shyne...\nIn 1597 Byrd's pupil Thomas Morley dedicated his treatise \"A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke\" to Byrd in flattering terms, though he may have intended to counterbalance this in the main text by some sharply satirical references to a mysterious \"Master Bold\". In \"The Compleat Gentleman\" (1622) Henry Peacham (1576\u20131643) praised Byrd in lavish terms as a composer of sacred music:\n\"For Motets and musick of piety and devotion, as well as for the honour of our Nation, as the merit of the man, I prefer above all our Phoenix M[aster] William Byrd, whom in that kind, I know not whether any may equall, I am sure none excel, even by the judgement of France and Italy, who are very sparing in the commendation of strangers, in regard of that conceipt they hold of themselves. His Cantiones Sacrae, as also his Gradualia, are mere Angelicall and Divine; and being of himself naturally disposed to Gravity and Piety, his vein is not so much for leight Madrigals or Canzonets, yet his Virginella and some others in his first Set, cannot be mended by the best Italian of them all.\"\nFinally, and most intriguingly, it has been suggested that a reference to \"the bird of loudest lay\" in Shakespeare's mysterious allegorical poem \"The Phoenix and the Turtle\" may be to the composer. The poem as a whole has been interpreted as an elegy for the Catholic martyr St Anne Line, who was executed at Tyburn on 27 February 1601 for harbouring priests.\nByrd was an active and influential teacher. As well as Morley, his pupils included Peter Philips, Tomkins and probably Thomas Weelkes, the first two of whom were important contributors to the Elizabethan and Jacobean virginalist school. However, by the time Byrd died in 1623 the English musical landscape was undergoing profound changes. The principal virginalist composers died off in the 1620s (except for Giles Farnaby, who died in 1640, and Thomas Tomkins, who lived on until 1656) and found no real successors. Thomas Morley, Byrd's other major composing pupil, devoted himself to the cultivation of the madrigal, a form in which Byrd himself took little interest. The native tradition of Latin music which Byrd had done so much to keep alive more or less died with him, while consort music underwent a huge change of character at the hands of a brilliant new generation of professional musicians at the Jacobean and Caroline courts. The English Civil War, and the change of taste brought about by the Stuart Restoration, created a cultural hiatus which adversely affected the cultivation of Byrd's music together with that of Tudor composers in general.\nIn a small way, it was his Anglican church music which came closest to establishing a continuous tradition, at least in the sense that some of it continued to be performed in choral foundations after the Restoration and into the eighteenth century. Byrd's exceptionally long lifespan meant that he lived into an age in which many of the forms of vocal and instrumental music which he had made his own were beginning to lose their appeal to most musicians. Despite the efforts of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century antiquarians, the reversal of this judgement had to wait for the pioneering work of twentieth-century scholars from E. H. Fellowes onwards.\nIn more recent times, Joseph Kerman, Oliver Neighbour, Philip Brett, John Harley, Richard Turbet, Alan Brown, Kerry McCarthy, and others have made major contributions to increasing our understanding of Byrd's life and music. In 1999, Davitt Moroney's recording of Byrd's complete keyboard music was released on Hyperion (CDA66551/7; re-issued as CDS44461/7). This recording, which won the 2000 Gramophone Award in the Early Music category and a 2000 Jahrespreis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik, came with a 100-page essay by Moroney on Byrd's keyboard music. In 2010, The Cardinall's Musick, under the direction of Andrew Carwood, completed their recorded survey of Byrd's Latin church music. This series of thirteen recordings marks the first time that all of Byrd's Latin music has been available on disc.\nIn popular culture.\nByrd's \"Cibavit eos\", an introit for Corpus Christi published in the \"Gradualia\", is sung at the beginning of Primal Fear (1996).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45343", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45343", "title": "Erich Fromm", "text": "German-American sociologist and psychoanalyst (1900\u20131980)\nErich Seligmann Fromm (; ; March 23, 1900 \u2013 March 18, 1980) was a German-American social psychologist, psychoanalyst, sociologist, humanistic philosopher, and democratic socialist. He was a German Jew who fled the Nazi regime and settled in the United States. He was one of the founders of The William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology in New York City and was associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory.\nLife.\nErich Fromm was born on March 23, 1900, at Frankfurt am Main, the only child of Rosa (n\u00e9e Krause) and Naphtali Fromm. He started his academic studies in 1918 at the University of Frankfurt am Main with two semesters of jurisprudence. During the summer semester of 1919, Fromm studied at the University of Heidelberg, where he began studying sociology under Alfred Weber (brother of sociologist Max Weber), psychiatrist-philosopher Karl Jaspers, and Heinrich Rickert. Fromm received his Ph.D. in sociology from Heidelberg in 1922 with a dissertation under the title \"Das j\u00fcdische Gesetz. Ein Beitrag zur Soziologie des Diaspora-Judentums\" (\"The Jewish Law: A Contribution to the Sociology of Jewish Diaspora\").\nFromm at the time became strongly involved in Zionism, under the influence of the religious Zionist rabbi Nehemia Anton Nobel. He was very active in Jewish \"Studentenverbindungen\" and other Zionist organisations.\nBut he soon turned away from Zionism, saying that it conflicted with his ideal of a \"universalist Messianism and Humanism\".\nDuring the mid-1920s, he trained to become a psychoanalyst through Frieda Reichmann's psychoanalytic sanatorium in Heidelberg. They married in 1926, but separated shortly after and divorced in 1942. He began his own clinical practice in 1927. In 1930 he joined the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research and completed his psychoanalytical training.\nAfter the Nazi takeover of power in Germany, Fromm moved first to Geneva and then, in 1934, to Columbia University in New York. Together with Karen Horney and Harry Stack Sullivan, Fromm belongs to a Neo-Freudian school of psychoanalytical thought. Horney and Fromm each had a marked influence on the other's thought, with Horney illuminating some aspects of psychoanalysis for Fromm and the latter elucidating sociology for Horney. Their relationship ended in the late 1930s. After leaving Columbia, Fromm helped form the New York branch of the Washington School of Psychiatry in 1943, and in 1946 co-founded the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and Psychology. He was on the faculty of Bennington College from 1941 to 1949, and taught courses at the New School for Social Research in New York from 1941 to 1959.\nWhen Fromm moved to Mexico City in 1949, he became a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and established a psychoanalytic section at the medical school there. Meanwhile, he taught as a professor of psychology at Michigan State University from 1957 to 1961 and as an adjunct professor of psychology at the graduate division of Arts and Sciences at New York University after 1962. He taught at UNAM until his retirement, in 1965, and at the Mexican Society of Psychoanalysis (SMP) until 1974. In 1974, he moved from Mexico City to Muralto, Switzerland, and died at his home in 1980, five days before his eightieth birthday. All the while, Fromm maintained his own clinical practice and published a series of books.\nFromm was reportedly an atheist but described his position as \"nontheistic mysticism\".\nPsychological theory.\nBeginning with his first seminal work of 1941, \"Escape from Freedom\" (known in Britain as \"The Fear of Freedom\"), Fromm's writings were notable as much for their social and political commentary as for their philosophical and psychological underpinnings. Indeed, \"Escape from Freedom\" is viewed as one of the founding works of political psychology. His second important work, \"Man for Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics\", first published in 1947, continued and enriched the ideas of \"Escape from Freedom\". Taken together, these books outlined Fromm's theory of human character, which was a natural outgrowth of Fromm's theory of human nature. Fromm's most popular book was \"The Art of Loving\", an international bestseller first published in 1956, which recapitulated and complemented the theoretical principles of human nature found in \"Escape from Freedom\" and \"Man for Himself\"\u2014principles which were revisited in many of Fromm's other major works.\nCentral to Fromm's world view was his interpretation of the Talmud and Hasidism. He began studying Talmud as a young man under Rabbi J. Horowitz and later under Rabbi Salman Baruch Rabinkow, a Chabad Hasid. While working towards his doctorate in sociology at the University of Heidelberg, Fromm studied the Tanya by the founder of Chabad, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi. Fromm also studied under Nehemia Nobel and Ludwig Krause while studying in Frankfurt. Fromm's grandfather and two great-grandfathers on his father's side were rabbis, and a great uncle on his mother's side was a noted Talmudic scholar. However, Fromm turned away from orthodox Judaism in 1926, towards secular interpretations of scriptural ideals.\nThe cornerstone of Fromm's humanistic philosophy is his interpretation of the biblical story of Adam and Eve's exile from the Garden of Eden. Drawing on his knowledge of the Talmud, Fromm pointed out that being able to distinguish between good and evil is generally considered to be a virtue, but that biblical scholars generally consider Adam and Eve to have \"sinned\" by disobeying God and eating from the Tree of Knowledge. However, departing from traditional religious orthodoxy on this, Fromm \"extolled\" the virtues of humans taking independent action and using reason to establish moral values rather than adhering to authoritarian moral values.\nBeyond a simple condemnation of authoritarian value systems, Fromm used the story of Adam and Eve as an allegorical explanation for human biological evolution and existential angst, asserting that when Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge, they became aware of themselves as being separate from nature while still being part of it. This is why they felt \"naked\" and \"ashamed\": they had evolved into human beings, conscious of themselves, their own mortality, and their powerlessness before the forces of nature and society, and no longer united with the universe as they were in their instinctive, pre-human existence as animals. According to Fromm, the awareness of a disunited human existence is a source of guilt and shame, and the solution to this existential dichotomy is found in the development of one's uniquely human powers of love and reason. However, Fromm distinguished \"his\" concept of love from unreflective \"popular\" notions as well as \"Freudian paradoxical\" love (see the criticism by Marcuse below).\nFromm considered love an interpersonal creative capacity rather than an emotion, and he distinguished this creative capacity from what he considered to be various forms of narcissistic neuroses and sado-masochistic tendencies that are commonly held out as proof of \"true love\". Indeed, Fromm viewed the experience of \"falling in love\" as evidence of one's failure to understand the true nature of love, which he believed always had the common elements of \"care\", \"responsibility\", \"respect\", and \"knowledge\". Drawing from his knowledge of the Hebrew Bible, Fromm pointed to the story of Jonah, who did not wish to save the residents of Nineveh from the consequences of their sin, as demonstrative of his belief that the qualities of \"care\" and \"responsibility\" are generally absent from most human relationships. Fromm also asserted that few people in modern society had \"respect\" for the autonomy of their fellow human beings, much less the objective \"knowledge\" of what other people truly wanted and needed.\nFromm believed that freedom was an aspect of human nature that we either embrace or escape. He observed that embracing our freedom of will was healthy, whereas escaping freedom through the use of escape mechanisms was the root of psychological conflicts. Fromm outlined three of the most common escape mechanisms:\nThe word biophilia was frequently used by Fromm as a description of a productive psychological orientation and \"state of being\". For example, in an addendum to his book \"The Heart of Man: Its Genius For Good and Evil\", Fromm wrote as part of his humanist credo:\n\"I believe that the man choosing progress can find a new unity through the development of all his human forces, which are produced in three orientations. These can be presented separately or together: biophilia, love for humanity and nature, and independence and freedom.\"\nErich Fromm postulated the following basic needs:\nFromm's thesis of the \"escape from freedom\" is epitomized in the following passage. The \"individualized man\" referenced by Fromm is man bereft of the \"primary ties\" of belonging (such as nature, family, etc.), also expressed as \"freedom from\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is only one possible, productive solution for the relationship of individualized man with the world: his active solidarity with all men and his spontaneous activity, love and work, which unite him again with the world, not by primary ties but as a free and independent individual... However, if the economic, social and political conditions... do not offer a basis for the realization of individuality in the sense just mentioned, while at the same time people have lost those ties which gave them security, this lag makes freedom an unbearable burden. It then becomes identical with doubt, with a kind of life which lacks meaning and direction. Powerful tendencies arise to escape from this kind of freedom into submission or some kind of relationship to man and the world which promises relief from uncertainty, even if it deprives the individual of his freedom.\u2014\u200a\nFive basic orientations.\nIn his book \"Man for Himself\", Fromm spoke of \"orientation of character\". He differentiates his theory of character from that of Freud by focusing on two ways an individual relates to the world. Freud analyzed character in terms of libido organization, whereas Fromm says that in the process of living, we relate to the world by: 1) acquiring and assimilating things\u2014\"Assimilation\", and 2) reacting to people\u2014\"Socialization\". Fromm asserted that these two ways of relating to the world were not instinctive, but an individual's response to the peculiar circumstances of his or her life; he also believed that people are never exclusively one type of orientation. These two ways of relating to life's circumstances lead to basic character-orientations.\nFromm lists four types of nonproductive character orientation, which he called receptive, exploitative, hoarding, and marketing, and one positive character orientation, which he called productive. Receptive and exploitative orientations are basically how an individual may relate to other people and are socialization attributes of character. A hoarding orientation is an acquiring and assimilating materials/valuables character trait. The marketing orientation arises in response to the human situation in the modern era. The current needs of the market determine value. It is a relativistic ethic. In contrast, the productive orientation is an objective ethic. Despite the existential struggles of humanity, each human has the potential for love, reason and productive work in life. Fromm writes, \"It is the paradox of human existence that man must simultaneously seek for closeness and for independence; for oneness with others and at the same time for the preservation of his uniqueness and particularity. ...the answer to this paradox \u2013 and to the moral problems of man \u2013 is productiveness.\"\nFromm's influence on other notable psychologists.\nFromm's four non-productive orientations were subject to validation through a psychometric test, \"The Person Relatedness Test\" by Elias H. Porter, PhD in collaboration with Carl Rogers, PhD at the University of Chicago's Counseling Center between 1953 and 1955. Fromm's four non-productive orientations also served as basis for the \"LIFO\" test, first published in 1967 by Stuart Atkins, Alan Katcher, PhD, and Elias Porter, PhD and the \"Strength Deployment Inventory\", first published in 1971 by Elias H. Porter, PhD. Fromm also influenced his student Sally L. Smith who went on to become the founder of the Lab School of Washington and the Baltimore Lab School.\nCritique of Freud.\nFromm examined the life and work of Sigmund Freud at length. He identified a discrepancy between early and later Freudian theory: namely that, prior to World War I, Freud had described human drives as a tension between desire and repression, but after the end of the war, began framing human drives as a struggle between biologically universal Life and Death (Eros and Thanatos) instincts. Fromm charged Freud and his followers with never acknowledging the contradictions between the two theories.\nFromm also criticized Freud's dualistic thinking. According to Fromm, Freudian descriptions of human consciousness as struggles between two poles were narrow and limiting. Fromm also condemned Freud as a misogynist unable to think outside the patriarchal milieu of early 20th century Vienna. However, in spite of these criticisms, Fromm nonetheless expressed a great respect for Freud and his accomplishments. Fromm contended that Freud was one of the \"architects of the modern age\", alongside Albert Einstein and Karl Marx, but emphasized that he considered Marx both far more historically important than Freud and a finer thinker.\nPolitical ideas and activism.\nFromm's best known work, \"Escape from Freedom\", focuses on the human urge to seek a source of authority and control upon reaching a freedom that was thought to be an individual's true desire. Fromm's critique of the modern political order and capitalist system led him to seek insights from medieval feudalism. In \"Escape from Freedom\", he discerned a certain value in the lack of individual freedom, rigid structure, and obligations required of the members of medieval society:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What characterizes medieval in contrast to modern society is its lack of individual freedom\u2026But altogether a person was not free in the modern sense, neither was he alone and isolated. In having a distinct, unchangeable, and unquestionable place in the social world from the moment of birth, man was rooted in a structuralized whole, and thus life had a meaning which left no place, and no need for doubt\u2026 There was comparatively little competition. One was born into a certain economic position which guaranteed a livelihood determined by tradition, just as it carried economic obligations to those higher in the social hierarchy.\nThe culmination of Fromm's social and political philosophy came in his 1955 book \"The Sane Society\", which argued in favor of a humanistic and democratic socialism. Building primarily upon the early works of Karl Marx, Fromm sought to re-emphasise the ideal of freedom, missing from most Soviet Marxism and more frequently found in the writings of libertarian socialists and liberal theoreticians. Fromm's brand of socialism rejected both Western capitalism and Soviet communism, which he saw as dehumanizing, and which resulted in the virtually universal modern phenomenon of alienation. \nFromm became one of the founders of socialist humanism, promoting the early writings of Marx and his humanist messages to the US and Western European public. He engaged with a Christian-Marxist intellectual dialogue group organized by Milan Machovec and others in 1960s Communist Czechoslovakia.\nIn the early 1960s, Fromm published two books dealing with Marxist thought (\"Marx's Concept of Man\" and \"Beyond the Chains of Illusion: My Encounter with Marx and Freud\"). In 1965, working to stimulate the Western and Eastern cooperation between Marxist humanists, Fromm published a series of articles entitled \"Socialist Humanism: An International Symposium\". In 1966, the American Humanist Association named him Humanist of the Year.\nFor a period, Fromm was also active in U.S. politics. He joined the Socialist Party of America in the mid-1950s, and did his best to help them provide an alternative viewpoint to McCarthyist trends in some US political thought. This alternative viewpoint was best expressed in his 1961 paper \"May Man Prevail? An Inquiry into the Facts and Fictions of Foreign Policy\". However, as a co-founder of SANE, Fromm's strongest political activism was in the international peace movement, fighting against the nuclear arms race and U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. After supporting Senator Eugene McCarthy's losing bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Fromm more or less retreated from the American political scene, although he did write a paper in 1974 entitled \"Remarks on the Policy of D\u00e9tente\" for a hearing held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Fromm was awarded the Nelly Sachs Prize in 1979.\nCriticism.\nIn \"Eros and Civilization\", Herbert Marcuse is critical of Fromm: In the beginning, he was a radical theorist, but later he turned to conformity. Marcuse also noted that Fromm, as well as his close colleagues Sullivan and Karen Horney, removed Freud's libido theory and other radical concepts, which thus reduced psychoanalysis to a set of idealist ethics, which only embrace the status quo. Fromm's response, in both \"The Sane Society\" and in \"The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness\", argues that Freud indeed deserves substantial credit for recognizing the central importance of the unconscious, but also that he tended to reify his own concepts that depicted the self as the passive outcome of instinct and social control, with minimal volition or variability. Fromm argues that later scholars such as Marcuse accepted these concepts as dogma, whereas social psychology requires a more dynamic theoretical and empirical approach.\nWorks.\nEarly work in German.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45344", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45344", "title": "Hash collision", "text": "Hash function phenomenon\nIn computer science, a hash collision or hash clash is when two distinct pieces of data in a hash table share the same hash value. The hash value in this case is derived from a hash function which takes a data input and returns a fixed length of bits.\nAlthough hash algorithms, especially cryptographic hash algorithms, have been created with the intent of being collision resistant, they can still sometimes map different data to the same hash (by virtue of the pigeonhole principle). Malicious users can take advantage of this to mimic, access, or alter data.\nDue to the possible negative applications of hash collisions in data management and computer security (in particular, cryptographic hash functions), collision avoidance has become an important topic in computer security.\nBackground.\nHash collisions can be unavoidable depending on the number of objects in a set and whether or not the bit string they are mapped to is long enough in length. When there is a set of \"n\" objects, if \"n\" is greater than |\"R\"|, which in this case \"R\" is the range of the hash value, the probability that there will be a hash collision is 1, meaning it is guaranteed to occur.\nAnother reason hash collisions are likely at some point in time stems from the idea of the birthday paradox in mathematics. This problem looks at the probability of a set of two randomly chosen people having the same birthday out of \"n\" number of people. This idea has led to what has been called the birthday attack. The premise of this attack is that it is difficult to find a birthday that specifically matches your birthday or a specific birthday, but the probability of finding a set of \"any\" two people with matching birthdays increases the probability greatly. Bad actors can use this approach to make it simpler for them to find hash values that collide with any other hash value \u2013 rather than searching for a specific value.\nThe impact of collisions depends on the application. When hash functions and fingerprints are used to identify similar data, such as homologous DNA sequences or similar audio files, the functions are designed so as to \"maximize\" the probability of collision between distinct but similar data, using techniques like locality-sensitive hashing. Checksums, on the other hand, are designed to minimize the probability of collisions between similar inputs, without regard for collisions between very different inputs. Instances where bad actors attempt to create or find hash collisions are known as collision attacks.\nIn practice, security-related applications use cryptographic hash algorithms, which are designed to be long enough for random matches to be unlikely, fast enough that they can be used anywhere, and safe enough that it would be extremely hard to find collisions.\nCollision resolution.\nIn hash tables, since hash collisions are inevitable, hash tables have mechanisms of dealing with them, known as collision resolutions. Two of the most common strategies are open addressing and separate chaining. The cache-conscious collision resolution is another strategy that has been discussed in the past for string hash tables.\nOpen addressing.\nCells in the hash table are assigned one of three states in this method \u2013 occupied, empty, or deleted. If a hash collision occurs, the table will be probed to move the record to an alternate cell that is stated as empty. There are different types of probing that take place when a hash collision happens and this method is implemented. Some types of probing are linear probing, double hashing, and quadratic probing. Open Addressing is also known as closed hashing.\nSeparate chaining.\nThis strategy allows more than one record to be \"chained\" to the cells of a hash table. If two records are being directed to the same cell, both would go into that cell as a linked list. This efficiently prevents a hash collision from occurring since records with the same hash values can go into the same cell, but it has its disadvantages. Keeping track of so many lists is difficult and can cause whatever tool that is being used to become very slow. Separate chaining is also known as open hashing.\nCache-conscious collision resolution.\nAlthough much less used than the previous two, has proposed the cache-conscious collision resolution method in 2005. It is a similar idea to the separate chaining methods, although it does not technically involve the chained lists. In this case, instead of chained lists, the hash values are represented in a contiguous list of items. This is better suited for string hash tables and the use for numeric values is still unknown.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His opposition to the condemnation of Flavian of Constantinople incurred the enmity of Dioscurus of Alexandria, who attempted to prevent him from leaving the city. Hilarius was able to make his escape and returned to Rome by an indirect route. He later erected an oratory at the Lateran in honor of John the Evangelist, to whom he attributed his safe passage.\nMuch of his pontificate was spent in maintaining ecclesiastical discipline in conformity with canon law, and in settling jurisdictional disputes among the bishops of both Gaul and Spain.\nEarly career.\nHilarius was born in Sardinia as the son of Crispinus. As archdeacon under Pope Leo I, he fought vigorously for the rights of the Roman See.\nIn 449, Hilarius and Bishop Julius of Puteoli served as papal legates to the Second Council of Ephesus. Pope Leo had sent a letter with the legates to be read at the council. However, the head notary declared that the emperor's letter should be read first and as the Council proceeded, Leo's letter ended up not being read at all. Hilarius vigorously opposed the condemnation of Flavian of Constantinople, pronouncing the single word in Latin, \"Contradicitur\", annulling the sentence in Leo's name.\nFor this he incurred the displeasure of Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria, who presided over the synod. Flavian died shortly afterwards, on 11 August 449, from injuries incurred from a physical assault by the followers of Dioscurus. According to a letter to Empress Pulcheria collected among the letters of Leo I, Hilarius apologized for not delivering to her the pope's letter after the synod, but owing to Dioscurus of Alexandria, who tried to hinder his going either to Rome or to Constantinople by having Ephesus' roads and docks watched, he had great difficulty in making his escape in order to bring to the pontiff the news of the result of the council. Flavian and Eusebius of Dorylaeum appealed to the pope, and their letters were probably taken by Hilarus to Rome.\nPapacy.\nAs pope, he continued the policy of his predecessor, Leo I, who, in his contest with Hilary of Arles, had obtained from Emperor Valentinian III a famous rescript of 444 (called \"Novel 17)\" confirming the supremacy of the bishop of Rome. Hilarius continued to strengthen ecclesiastical government in Gaul and Spain. \nIn Rome, Hilarius worked zealously to counter the new emperor's 467 edict of toleration for schismatic sects, which had been inspired, according to a letter of Pope Gelasius I, by a favourite of Emperor Anthemius named Philotheus, who espoused the Macedonian heresy. On one of the emperor's visits to St Peter's Basilica, the pope openly called him to account for his favourite's conduct, exhorting him by the grave of St Peter to promise that he would allow no schismatical assemblies in Rome.\nEcclesiastical disputes.\nHermes, a former archdeacon of Narbonne, had illegally acquired the bishopric of that town. Two Gallican prelates were dispatched to Rome to lay before the pope this and other matters concerning the Church in Gaul. A Roman synod held on 19 November, 462, passed judgment upon these matters. Hilarius sent an Encyclical advising the provincial bishops of Vienne, Lyons, Narbonne, and the Alps that Hermes was to remain titular bishop of Narbonne, but his episcopal faculties were withheld.\nOther decisions expressed in an encyclical were in the interests of increased discipline. A synod was to be convened yearly by the bishop of Arles, but all important matters were to be submitted to the Apostolic See. No bishop could leave his diocese without a written permission from his metropolitan, with a right of appeal to the Bishop of Arles. Respecting the parishes (\"paroeciae\") claimed by Bishop Leontius of Arles as belonging to his jurisdiction, the Gallican bishops could decide, after an investigation. Church property could not be alienated until a synod had looked into the purpose of the sale.\nShortly after this, the pope found himself involved in another diocesan quarrel. In 463, Mamertus of Vienne had consecrated Marcel as the bishop of Die, although this Church, by a decree of Leo I, belonged to the metropolitan Diocese of Arles. When Hilarius heard of it, he deputed Leontius of Arles to summon a great synod of the bishops of several provinces to investigate the matter. The synod took place and, on the strength of the report given him by Bishop Antonius, he issued an edict dated 25 February 464 in which Bishop Veranus was commissioned to warn Mamertus that, if in the future he did not refrain from irregular ordinations, his faculties would be withdrawn. Consequently, the consecration of the Bishop of Die would be sanctioned by Leontius of Arles. Thus the primatial privileges of the See of Arles were upheld as Leo I had defined them. At the same time, the bishops were admonished not to overstep their boundaries and to assemble in a yearly synod presided over by the Bishop of Arles. The metropolitan rights of the See of Embrun over the dioceses of the Maritime Alps were protected against the encroachments of a certain Bishop Auxanius, particularly in connection with the two Churches of Nice and Cimiez.\nHilarius gave decisions to the churches of Hispania, which tended to operate outside the papal orbit in the 5th century. Bishop Silvanus of Calahorra had violated the church laws by his episcopal ordinations, and the pope was asked for his decision. Before an answer came to their petition, the same bishops had recourse to the Holy See for an entirely different matter. Before his death, Nundinarius, Bishop of Barcelona, expressed a wish that Irenaeus might be chosen his successor, and he himself had made Irenaeus bishop of another See. The request was granted and the Synod of Tarragona confirmed the nomination of Irenaeus, after which the bishops sought the pope's approval. The Roman synod of 19 November 465, held in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, which decided that Irenaeus, the nominated bishop, should quit the see of Barcelona and return to his former one, while the Spanish bishops were directed to condone the acts of Silvanus. This is the oldest Roman synod whose original records have survived.\nConstruction projects.\nHilarius erected several churches and other buildings in Rome, for which the \"Liber Pontificalis,\" the main source for information about Hilarius, praises him. He also erected a chapel of the Holy Cross in the baptistery, convents, two public baths, and libraries near the Basilica of St. Lawrence outside the Walls. He built two oratories in the baptistery of the Lateran, one in honor of John the Baptist, the other of John the Apostle, to whom he attributed his safe escape from the Council of Ephesus, thus satisfying the question as to which saints the Lateran had been dedicated.\nDeath.\nHilarius died on 29 February 468 and was buried in Basilica of St. Lawrence outside the Walls. His feast day is celebrated on 17 November in the Roman Catholic Church and 28 February in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45346", "revid": "45306417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45346", "title": "Theories of urban planning", "text": "Body of knowledge of urban planning\nPlanning theory is the body of scientific concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning. Urban planning is the strategic process of designing and managing the growth and development of human settlements, from small towns to sprawling metropolitan areas. Various planning theories guide urban development decisions and policies. Over time, different schools of thought have emerged, Evolving in response to shifts in society, economy, and technology. This article explores the key theories and movements that have shaped urban planning.There is no one unified planning theory but various. Whittemore identifies nine procedural theories that dominated the field between 1959 and 1983: the Rational-Comprehensive approach, the Incremental approach, the Transformative Incremental (TI) approach, the Transactive approach, the Communicative approach, the Advocacy approach, the Equity approach, the Radical approach, and the Humanist or Phenomenological approach.\nBackground.\nUrban planning can include urban renewal, by adapting urban planning methods to existing cities suffering from decline. Alternatively, it can concern the massive challenges associated with urban growth, particularly in the Global South. All in all, urban planning exists in various forms and addresses many different issues. The modern origins of urban planning lie in the movement for urban reform that arose as a reaction against the disorder of the industrial city in the mid-19th century. The new imagined urban form was meant to go hand-in-hand with a new society, based upon voluntary co-operation within self-governing communities.\nIn the late 20th century, the term sustainable development has come to represent an ideal outcome in the sum of all planning goals. Sustainable architecture involves renewable materials and energy sources and is increasing in importance as an environmentally friendly solution\nBlueprint planning.\nSince at least the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment, urban planning had generally been assumed to be the physical planning and design of human communities. Therefore, it was seen as related to architecture and civil engineering, and thereby to be carried out by such experts. This kind of planning was physicalist and design-orientated, and involved the production of masterplans and blueprints which would show precisely what the 'end-state' of land use should be, similar to architectural and engineering plans. Similarly, the theory of urban planning was mainly interested in visionary planning and design which would demonstrate how the ideal city should be organised spatially.\nSanitary movement.\nAlthough it can be seen as an extension of the sort of civic pragmatism seen in Oglethorpe's plan for Savannah or William Penn's plan for Philadelphia, the roots of the rational planning movement lie in Britain's Sanitary movement (1800\u20131890). During this period, advocates such as Charles Booth argued for central organized, top-down solutions to the problems of industrializing cities. In keeping with the rising power of industry, the source of the planning authority in The Sanitary Movement arose as a direct response to the appalling living conditions in rapidly industrializing cities, focusing on improving public health through the creation of better sanitation infrastructure, including sewage systems and clean water supplies.\nGarden city movement.\nThe Garden city movement was founded by Ebenezer Howard (1850-1928).The Garden City Movement advocated for the development of self-sufficient, planned communities that combined the best aspects of both urban and rural living. These communities would be surrounded by green belts to provide residents with access to nature while maintaining proximity to urban amenities. His ideas were expressed in the book Garden Cities of To-morrow (1898). His influences included Benjamin Walter Richardson, who had published a pamphlet in 1876 calling for low population density, good housing, wide roads, an underground railway and for open space; Thomas Spence who had supported common ownership of land and the sharing of the rents it would produce; Edward Gibbon Wakefield who had pioneered the idea of colonizing planned communities to house the poor in Adelaide (including starting new cities separated by green belts at a certain point); James Silk Buckingham who had designed a model town with a central place, radial avenues and industry in the periphery; as well as Alfred Marshall, Peter Kropotkin and the back-to-the-land movement, which had all called for the moving of masses to the countryside.\nHoward aimed to merge urban convenience with rural tranquility to promote healthier communities called Town-Country. To make this happen, a group of individuals would establish a limited-dividend company to buy cheap agricultural land, which would then be developed with investment from manufacturers and housing for the workers. No more than 32,000 people would be housed in a settlement, spread over 1,000 acres. Around it would be a permanent green belt of 5,000 acres, with farms and institutions (such as mental institutions) which would benefit from the location. After reaching the limit, a new settlement would be started, connected by an inter-city rail, with the polycentric settlements together forming the \"Social City\". The lands of the settlements would be jointly owned by the inhabitants, who would use rents received from it to pay off the mortgage necessary to buy the land and then invest the rest in the community through social security. Actual garden cities were built by Howard in Letchworth, Brentham Garden Suburb, and Welwyn Garden City. The movement would also inspire the later New towns movement.\nLinear city.\nArturo Soria y Mata's idea of the Linear city (1882) replaced the traditional idea of the city as a centre and a periphery with the idea of constructing linear sections of infrastructure - roads, railways, gas, water, etc.- along an optimal line and then attaching the other components of the city along the length of this line. As compared to the concentric diagrams of Ebenezer Howard and other in the same period, Soria's linear city creates the infrastructure for a controlled process of expansion that joins one growing city to the next in a rational way, instead of letting them both sprawl. The linear city was meant to \u2018ruralize the city and urbanize the countryside\u2019, and to be universally applicable as a ring around existing cities, as a strip connecting two cities, or as an entirely new linear town across an unurbanized region. The idea was later taken up by Nikolay Alexandrovich Milyutin in the planning circles of the 1920s Soviet Union. The Ciudad Lineal was a practical application of the concept.\nRegional planning movement.\nPatrick Geddes (1864-1932) was the founder of regional planning. His main influences were the geographers \u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus and Paul Vidal de La Blache, as well as the sociologist Pierre Guillaume Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric le Play. From these he received the idea of the natural region. According to Geddes, planning must start by surveying such a region by crafting a \"Valley Section\" which shows the general slope from mountains to the sea that can be identified across scale and place in the world, with the natural environment and the cultural environments produced by it included. This was encapsulated in the motto \"Survey before Plan\". He saw cities as being changed by technology into more regional settlements, for which he coined the term \"conurbation\". Similar to the garden city movement, he also believed in adding green areas to these urban regions. The Regional Planning Association of America advanced his ideas, coming up with the 'regional city' which would have a variety of urban communities across a green landscape of farms, parks and wilderness with the help of telecommunication and the automobile. This had major influence on the County of London Plan, 1944.\nCity Beautiful movement.\nThe City Beautiful movement was inspired by 19th century European capital cities such as Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann's Paris or the Vienna Ring Road. An influential figure was Daniel Burnham (1846-1912), who was the chief of construction of the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Urban problems such as the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago had created a perceived need to reform the morality of the city among some of the elites. Burnham's greatest achievement was the Chicago plan of 1909. His aim was \"to restore to the city a lost visual and aesthetic harmony, thereby creating the physical prerequisite for the emergence of a harmonious social order\", essentially creating social reform through new slum clearance and creating public space, which also endeared it the support of the Progressivist movement. This was also believed to be economically advantageous by drawing in tourists and wealthy migrants. Because of this it has been referred to as \"trickle-down urban development\" and as \"centrocentrist\" for focusing only on the core of the city. Other major cities planned according to the movement principles included British colonial capitals in New Delhi, Harare, Lusaka Nairobi and Kampala, as well as that of Canberra in Australia, and Albert Speer's plan for the Nazi capital Germania.\nTowers in the park.\nLe Corbusier (1887\u20131965) pioneered a new urban form called towers in the park. His approach was based on defining the house as 'a machine to live in'. The Plan Voisin he devised for Paris, which was never fulfilled, would have involved the demolition of much of historic Paris in favour of 18 uniform 700-foot tower blocks. Ville Contemporaine and the Ville Radieuse formulated his basic principles, including decongestion of the city by increased density and open space by building taller on a smaller footprint. Wide avenues should also be built to the city centre by demolishing old structures, which was criticized for lack of environmental awareness. His generic ethos of planning was based on the rule of experts who would \"work out their plans in total freedom from partisan pressures and special interests\" and that \"once their plans are formulated, they must be implemented without opposition\". His influence on the Soviet Union helped inspire the 'urbanists' who wanted to build planned cities full of massive apartment blocks in Soviet countryside. The only city which he ever actually helped plan was Chandigarh in India. Bras\u00edlia, planned by Oscar Niemeyer, also was heavily influenced by his thought. Both cities suffered from the issue of unplanned settlements growing outside them.\nDecentralised planning.\nIn the United States, Frank Lloyd Wright similarly identified vehicular mobility as a principal planning metric. Car-based suburbs had already been developed in the Country Club District in 1907-1908 (including later the world's first car-based shopping centre of Country Club Plaza), as well as in Beverly Hills in 1914 and Palos Verdes Estates in 1923. Wright began to idealise this vision in his Broadacre City starting in 1924, with similarities to the garden city and regional planning movements. The fundamental idea was for technology to liberate individuals. In his Usonian vision, he described the city as\"spacious, well-landscaped highways, grade crossings eliminated by a new kind of integrated by-passing or over- or under-passing all traffic in cultivated or living areas \u2026 Giant roads, themselves great architecture, pass public service stations . . . passing by farm units, roadside markets, garden schools, dwelling places, each on its acres of individually adorned and cultivated ground\".This was justified as a democratic ideal, as \"\u201cDemocracy is the ideal of reintegrated decentralization \u2026 many free units developing strength as they learn by function and grow together in spacious mutual freedom.\u201d This vision was however criticized by Herbert Muschamp as being contradictory in its call for individualism while relying on the master-architect to design it all.\nAfter World War II, suburbs similar to Broadacre City spread throughout the US, but without the social or economic aspects of his ideas. A notable example was that of Levittown, built 1947 to 1951. The suburban design was criticized for their lack of form by Lewis Mumford as it lacked clear boundaries, and by Ian Nairn because \"Each building is treated in isolation, nothing binds it to the next one\".\nIn the Soviet Union too, the so-called deurbanists (such as Moisei Ginzburg and Mikhail Okhitovich) advocated for the use of electricity and new transportation technologies (especially the car) to disperse the population from the cities to the countryside, with the ultimate aim of a \"townless, fully decentralized, and evenly populated country\". However, in 1931 the Communist Party ruled such views as forbidden.\nOpposition to blueprint planning.\nThroughout both the United States and Europe, the rational planning movement declined in the latter half of the 20th century. Key events in the United States include the demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis and the national backlash against urban renewal projects, particularly urban expressway projects. An influential critic of such planning was Jane Jacobs, who wrote \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" in 1961, claimed to be \"one of the most influential books in the short history of city planning\". She attacked the garden city movement because its \"prescription for saving the city was to do the city in\" and because it \"conceived of planning also as essentially paternalistic, if not authoritarian\". The Corbusians on the other hand were claimed to be egoistic. In contrast, she defended the dense traditional inner-city neighborhoods like Brooklyn Heights or North Beach, San Francisco, and argued that an urban neighbourhood required about 200-300 people per acre, as well as a high net ground coverage at the expense of open space. She also advocated for a diversity of land uses and building types, with the aim of having a constant churn of people throughout the neighbourhood across the times of the day. This essentially meant defending urban environments as they were before modern planning had aimed to start changing them. As she believed that such environments were essentially self-organizing, her approach was effectively one of laissez-faire, and has been criticized for not being able to guarantee \"the development of good neighbourhoods\".\nThe most radical opposition to blueprint planning was declared in 1969 in a manifesto on the \"New Society\", with the words that: The whole concept of planning (the town-and-country kind at least) has gone cockeyed \u2026 Somehow, everything must be watched; nothing must be allowed simply to \u201chappen.\u201d No house can be allowed to be commonplace in the way that things just are commonplace: each project must be weighed, and planned, and approved, and only then built, and only after that discovered to be commonplace after all.Another form of opposition came from the advocacy planning movement, opposes to traditional top-down and technical planning.\nModernist planning.\nCybernetics and modernism inspired the related theories of rational process and systems approaches to urban planning in the 1960s. They were imported into planning from other disciplines. The systems approach was a reaction to the issues associated with the traditional view of planning. It did not understand the social and economic sides of cities, the complexity and interconnectedness of urban life, as well as lacking in flexibility. The 'quantitative revolution' of the 1960s also created a drive for more scientific and precise thinking, while the rise of ecology made the approach more natural.\nSystems theory.\nSystems theory is based on the conception of phenomena as 'systems', which are themselves coherent entities composed of interconnected and interdependent parts. A city can in this way be conceptualised as a system with interrelated parts of different land uses, connected by transport and other communications. The aim of urban planning thereby becomes that of planning and controlling the system. Similar ideas had been put forward by Geddes, who had seen cities and their regions as analogous to organisms, though they did not receive much attention while planning was dominated by architects.\nThe idea of the city as a system meant that it became critical for planners to understand how cities functioned. It also meant that a change to one part in a city would have effects on others parts as well. There were also doubts raised about the goal of producing detailed blueprints of how cities should look like in the end, instead suggesting the need for more flexible plans with trajectories instead of fixed futures. Planning should also be an ongoing process of monitoring and taking action in the city, rather than just producing the blueprint at one time. The systems approach also necessitated taking into account the economic and social aspects of cities, beyond just the aesthetic and physical ones.\nRational process approach.\nThe focus on the procedural aspect of planning had already been pioneered by Geddes in his Survey-Analysis-Plan approach. However, this approach had several shortfalls. It did not consider the reasons for doing a survey in the first place. It also suggested that there should be simply a single plan to be considered. Finally, it did not take into account the implementation stage of the plan. There should also be further action in monitoring the outcomes of the plan after that. The rational process, in contrast, identified five different stages: (1) the definition of problems and aims; (2) the identification of alternatives; (3) the evaluation of alternatives; (4) implementation: (5) monitoring. This new approach represented a rejection of blueprint planning.\nIncrementalism.\nBeginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, critiques of the rational paradigm began to emerge and formed into several different schools of planning thought. The first of these schools is Lindblom's incrementalism. Lindblom describes planning as \"muddling through\" and thought that practical planning required decisions to be made incrementally. This incremental approach meant choosing from small number of policy approaches that can only have a small number consequences and are firmly bounded by reality, constantly adjusting the objectives of the planning process and using multiple analyses and evaluations.\nMixed scanning model.\nThe mixed scanning model, developed by Etzioni, takes a similar approach to Lindblom. Etzioni (1968) suggested that organizations plan on two different levels: the tactical and the strategic. He posited that organizations could accomplish this by essentially scanning the environment on multiple levels and then choose different strategies and tactics to address what they found there. While Lindblom's approach only operated on the functional level Etzioni argued, the mixed scanning approach would allow planning organizations to work on both the functional and more big-picture oriented levels.\nPostmodern planning.\nModernism sought to design and plan cities that followed the logic of the new model of industrial mass production; reverting to large-scale solutions, aesthetic standardization, and prefabricated design solutions. This approach was found to have eroded urban living by its failure to recognize differences and aim towards homogeneous landscapes. Jane Jacobs's 1961 book \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities,\" was a sustained critique of urban planning as it had developed within modernism, and played a major role in turning public opinion against modernist planners, notably Robert Moses.\nPostmodern urban planning involves theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, elevating uncertainty, flexibility, and change, and rejecting utopianism while embracing a utopian way of thinking and acting. The postmodernity of \"resistance\" seeks to deconstruct modernism, a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them. As a result, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single \"right way\" of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of \"how to plan\".\nThis postmodern reaction is often compared with the modernist Chicago School, the then dominant movement founded at the University of Chicago in the 1920s. Sociologist Ernest Burgess's prominent concentric circle model depicted urban areas as a series of concentric functional zones that sorted population groups. It proposed a central business core, circled by transitional immigrant and working class areas, then by more affluent outer commuter rings. In contrast, for example, the postmodernist Los Angeles School, primarily associated with the University of California at LA, viewed Los Angeles as a prototypical postmodern city, a \"multi-nucleated megacity encompassing hundreds of municipalities\", sprawling and centerless. The LA School analysis emphasized the global-local connection, pervasive social fragmentation, and a \"reterritorialization of the urban process in which hinterland organizes the center (in direct contradiction to the Chicago model)\".\nA review of postmodern urbanism literature, published in 2018 in the \"Journal of Architectural and Planning Research\", examined coverage of style, epoch, and method, noting a general lack of cohesive definition, and the use of questionable interpretation to form conceptual statements. The review concluded that as a theoretical construct, postmodern urbanism \"is relevant to planning and design theory insofar as it rejects modernist 'rational' planning.\" However, given that urban planning and design are grounded in practice, postmodern theoretical ideas offer \"little insight that professionals can use.\"\nPolitical planning.\nIn the 1960s, a view emerged of planning as an inherently normative and political activity. Advocates of this approach included Norman Dennis, Martin Meyerson, Edward C. Banfield, Paul Davidoff, and Norton E. Long, the latter remarking that:Plans are policies and policies, in a democracy at any rate, spell politics. The question is not whether planning will reflect politics but whose politics it will reflect. What values and whose values will planners seek to implement? . . . No longer can the planner take refuge in the neutrality of the objectivity of the personally uninvolved scientist.The choices between alternative end points in planning was a key issue which was seen as political.\nParticipatory planning.\nParticipatory planning is an urban planning paradigm that emphasizes involving the entire community in the strategic and management processes of urban planning; or, community-level planning processes, urban or rural. It is often considered as part of community development. Participatory planning aims to harmonize views among all of its participants as well as prevent conflict between opposing parties. In addition, marginalized groups have an opportunity to participate in the planning process.\nPatrick Geddes had first advocated for the \"real and active participation\" of citizens when working in the British Raj, arguing against the \"Dangers of Municipal Government from above\" which would cause \"detachment from public and popular feeling, and consequently, before long, from public and popular needs and usefulness\". Further on, self-build was researched by Raymond Unwin in the 1930s in his \"Town Planning in Practice\". The Italian anarchist architect Giancarlo De Carlo then argued in 1948 that \"\u201cThe housing problem cannot be solved from above. It is a problem of the people, and it will not be solved, or even boldly faced, except by the concrete will and action of the people themselves\", and that planning should exist \"as the manifestation of communal collaboration\". Through the Architectural Association School of Architecture, his ideas caught John Turner, who started working in Peru with Eduardo Neira. He would go on working in Lima from the mid-'50s to the mid-'60s. There he found that the \"barrios\" were not slums, but were rather highly organised and well-functioning. As a result, he came to the conclusion that:\"When dwellers control the major decisions and are free to make their own contributions in the design, construction or management of their housing, both this process and the environment produced stimulate individual and social well-being. When people have no control over nor responsibility for key decisions in the housing process, on the other hand, dwelling environments may instead become a barrier to personal fulfillment and a burden on the economy.\"The role of the government was to provide a framework within which people would be able to work freely, for example by providing them the necessary resources, infrastructure and land. Self-build was later again taken up by Christopher Alexander, who led a project called People Rebuild Berkeley in 1972, with the aim to create \"self-sustaining, self-governing\" communities, though it ended up being closer to traditional planning.\nSynoptic planning.\nAfter the \"fall\" of blueprint planning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the synoptic model began to emerge as a dominant force in planning. Lane (2005) describes synoptic planning as having four central elements:\n\"(1) an enhanced emphasis on the specification of goals and targets; (2) an emphasis on quantitative analysis and predication of the environment; (3) a concern to identify and evaluate alternative policy options; and (4) the evaluation of means against ends (page 289).\"\nPublic participation was first introduced into this model and it was generally integrated into the system process described above. However, the problem was that the idea of a single public interest still dominated attitudes, effectively devaluing the importance of participation because it suggests the idea that the public interest is relatively easy to find and only requires the most minimal form of participation.\nTransactive planning.\nTransactive planning was a radical break from previous models. Instead of considering public participation as a method that would be used in addition to the normal training planning process, participation was a central goal. For the first time, the public was encouraged to take on an active role in the policy-setting process, while the planner took on the role of a distributor of information and a feedback source. Transactive planning focuses on interpersonal dialogue that develops ideas, which will be turned into action. One of the central goals is mutual learning where the planner gets more information on the community and citizens to become more educated about planning issues.\nAdvocacy planning.\nFormulated in the 1960s by lawyer and planning scholar Paul Davidoff, the advocacy planning model takes the perspective that there are large inequalities in the political system and in the bargaining process between groups that result in large numbers of people unorganized and unrepresented in the process. It concerns itself with ensuring that all people are equally represented in the planning process by advocating for the interests of the underprivileged and seeking social change. Again, public participation is a central tenet of this model. A plurality of public interests is assumed, and the role of the planner is essentially the one as a facilitator who either advocates directly for underrepresented groups directly or encourages them to become part of the process.\nRadical planning.\nRadical planning is a stream of urban planning which seeks to manage development in an equitable and community-based manner. The seminal text to the radical planning movement is \"Foundations for a Radical Concept in Planning\" (1973), by Stephen Grabow and Allen Heskin. Grabow and Heskin provided a critique of planning as elitist, centralizing and change-resistant, and proposed a new paradigm based upon systems change, decentralization, communal society, facilitation of human development and consideration of ecology. Grabow and Heskin were joined by \"Head of Department of Town Planning\" from the Polytechnic of the South Bank Shean McConnell, and his 1981 work \"Theories for Planning\".\nIn 1987 John Friedmann entered the fray with \"Planning in the Public Domain: From Knowledge to Action\", promoting a radical planning model based on \"decolonization\", \"democratization\", \"self-empowerment\" and \"reaching out\". Friedmann described this model as an \"Agropolitan development\" paradigm, emphasizing the re-localization of primary production and manufacture. In \"Toward a Non-Euclidian Mode of Planning\" (1993) Friedmann further promoted the urgency of decentralizing planning, advocating a planning paradigm that is normative, innovative, political, transactive and based on a social learning approach to knowledge and policy.\nBargaining model.\nThe bargaining model views planning as the result of giving and take on the part of a number of interests who are all involved in the process. It argues that this bargaining is the best way to conduct planning within the bounds of legal and political institutions. The most interesting part of this theory of planning is that it makes public participation the central dynamic in the decision-making process. Decisions are made first and foremost by the public, and the planner plays a more minor role.\nCommunicative approach.\nThe communicative approach to planning is perhaps the most difficult to explain. It focuses on using communication to help different interests in the process to understand each other. The idea is that each individual will approach a conversation with his or her own subjective experience in mind and that from that conversation shared goals and possibilities will emerge. Again, participation plays a central role in this model. The model seeks to include a broad range of voice to enhance the debate and negotiation that is supposed to form the core of actual plan making. In this model, participation is actually fundamental to the planning process happening. Without the involvement of concerned interests, there is no planning. Looking at each of these models it becomes clear that participation is not only shaped by the public in a given area or by the attitude of the planning organization or planners that work for it. In fact, public participation is largely influenced by how planning is defined, how planning problems are defined, the kinds of knowledge that planners choose to employ and how the planning context is set. Though some might argue that is too difficult to involve the public through transactive, advocacy, bargaining and communicative models because transportation is some ways more technical than other fields, it is important to note that transportation is perhaps unique among planning fields in that its systems depend on the interaction of a number of individuals and organizations.\nProcess.\nChanges to the planning process.\nStrategic Urban Planning over past decades have witnessed the metamorphosis of the role of the urban planner in the planning process. More citizens calling for democratic planning &amp; development processes have played a huge role in allowing the public to make important decisions as part of the planning process. Community organizers and social workers are now very involved in planning from the grassroots level. The term advocacy planning was coined by Paul Davidoff in his influential 1965 paper, \"Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning\" which acknowledged the political nature of planning and urged planners to acknowledge that their actions are not value-neutral and encouraged minority and underrepresented voices to be part of planning decisions. Benveniste argued that planners had a political role to play and had to bend some truth to power if their plans were to be implemented.\nDevelopers have also played huge roles in development, particularly by planning projects. Many recent developments were results of large and small-scale developers who purchased land, designed the district and constructed the development from scratch. The Melbourne Docklands, for example, was largely an initiative pushed by private developers to redevelop the waterfront into a high-end residential and commercial district.\nRecent theories of urban planning, espoused, for example by Salingaros see the city as an adaptive system that grows according to process similar to those of plants. They say that urban planning should thus take its cues from such natural processes. Such theories also advocate participation by inhabitants in the design of the urban environment, as opposed to simply leaving all development to large-scale construction firms.\nIn the process of creating an urban plan or urban design, carrier-infill is one mechanism of spatial organization in which the city's figure and ground components are considered separately. The urban figure, namely buildings, is represented as total possible building volumes, which are left to be designed by architects in the following stages. The urban ground, namely in-between spaces and open areas, are designed to a higher level of detail. The carrier-infill approach is defined by an urban design performing as the carrying structure that creates the shape and scale of the spaces, including future building volumes that are then infilled by architects' designs. The contents of the carrier structure may include street pattern, landscape architecture, open space, waterways, and other infrastructure. The infill structure may contain zoning, building codes, quality guidelines, and Solar Access based upon a solar envelope. Carrier-Infill urban design is differentiated from complete urban design, such as in the monumental axis of Bras\u00edlia, in which the urban design and architecture were created together.\nIn carrier-infill urban design or urban planning, the negative space of the city, including landscape, open space, and infrastructure is designed in detail. The positive space, typically building a site for future construction, is only represented in unresolved volumes. The volumes are representative of the total possible building envelope, which can then be infilled by individual architects.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

He starred opposite Lillian Gish in D. W. Griffith's \"Broken Blossoms\" (1919) and \"Way Down East\" (1920) and was among the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927. The following year, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for two films: \"The Patent Leather Kid\" and \"The Noose\".\nEarly life.\nBarthelmess was born in New York City, the son of Caroline W. Harris, a stage actress, and Alfred W. Barthelmess. His father died when he was a year old. Through his mother, he grew up in the theatre, doing \"walk-ons\" from an early age. In contrast to that, he was educated at Hudson River Military Academy at Nyack, New York and Trinity College at Hartford, Connecticut. He did some acting in college and other amateur productions. By 1919 he had five years in stock company experience.\nCareer.\nRussian actress Alla Nazimova, a friend of the family, was taught English by Caroline Barthelmess. Nazimova convinced Richard Barthelmess to try acting professionally, and he made his debut screen appearance in 1916 in the serial \"Gloria's Romance\" as an uncredited extra. He also appeared as a supporting player in several films starring Marguerite Clark.\nHis next role, in \"War Brides\" opposite Nazimova, attracted the attention of director D.W. Griffith, who offered him several important roles, finally casting him opposite Lillian Gish in \"Broken Blossoms\" (1919) and \"Way Down East\" (1920). He founded his own production company, Inspiration Film Company, together with Charles Duell and Henry King. One of their films, \"Tol'able David\" (1921), in which Barthelmess starred as a teenage mailman who finds courage, was a major success. In 1922, \"Photoplay\" described him as the \"idol of every girl in America.\"\nBarthelmess had a large female following during the 1920s. An admirer wrote to the editor of \"Picture-Play Magazine\" in 1921:Different fans have different opinions, and although Wallace Reid, Thomas Meighan, and Niles Welch are mighty fine chaps, I think that Richard Barthelmess beats them all. Dick is getting more and more popular every day, and why? Because his wonderful black hair and soulful eyes are enough to make any young girl adore him. The first play I saw Dick in was \"Boots\"\u2014Dorothy Gish playing the lead. This play impressed me so that I went to see every play in which he appeared\u2014\"Three Men and a Girl,\" \"Scarlet Days,\" \"The Love Flower,\" and \"Broken Blossoms,\" in which I decided that Dick was my favorite. I am looking forward to \"Way Down East\" as being a great success, because I know Dick will play a good part.\nBarthelmess soon became one of Hollywood's higher paid performers, starring in such classics as \"The Patent Leather Kid\" in 1927 and \"The Noose\" in 1928; he was nominated for Best Actor at the first Academy Awards for his performance in both films. In addition, he won a special citation for producing \"The Patent Leather Kid\".\nWith the advent of the sound era, Barthelmess remained a star for a number of years. He played numerous leads in talkie films, most notably \"Son of the Gods\" (1930), \"The Dawn Patrol\" (1930), \"The Last Flight\" (1931), \"The Cabin in the Cotton\" (1932) and \"Heroes for Sale\" (1933). He was able to choose his own material and often played in controversial or socially conscious films. However, his popularity began to wane in the 1930s. He became too old for the boyish leads he usually played. In his later films (between 1939 and his retirement in 1942), he turned towards character roles \u2013 most notably, his supporting role as the disgraced pilot and husband of Rita Hayworth's character in \"Only Angels Have Wings\" (1939).\nPost-acting career.\nBarthelmess failed to maintain the stardom of his silent film days and gradually left entertainment. He enlisted in the United States Navy Reserve during World War II, and served as a lieutenant commander, stationed at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. He never returned to film, preferring to live off his real estate investments.\nPersonal life.\nOn June 18, 1920, Barthelmess married Mary Hay, a stage and screen star, in New York. They had one daughter, Mary Barthelmess, before divorcing on January 15, 1927.\nIn August 1927, Barthelmess became engaged to Katherine Young Wilson, a Broadway actress. However, the engagement was called off due to Wilson's stated desire to continue acting, or possibly his affair around this time with the journalist Adela Rogers St. Johns.\nOn April 21, 1928, Barthelmess married Jessica Stewart Sargent. He later adopted her son, Stewart, from a previous marriage. They remained married until Barthelmess' death in 1963.\nDeath.\nBarthelmess died of throat cancer on August 17, 1963, aged 68, in Southampton, New York. He was interred at the Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45353", "revid": "50665045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45353", "title": "Writer", "text": "Person who writes texts\nA writer is a person who uses written words in different writing styles, genres, and techniques to communicate ideas, to inspire feelings and emotions, or to entertain. Writers may develop different forms of writing such as novels, short stories, monographs, travelogues, plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as reports, educational material, and news articles that may be of interest to the general public. Writers' works are nowadays published across a wide range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.\nThe term \"writer\" is also used elsewhere in the arts and music, such as songwriter or a screenwriter, but also a stand-alone \"writer\" typically refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.\nWriters can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media such as graphics or illustration to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind. Some writers may use images (drawing, painting, graphics) or multimedia to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.\nAs well as producing their own written works, writers often write about \"how\" they write (their writing process); \"why\" they write (that is, their motivation); and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism). Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance, or on acceptance, or only after their work is published. Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are not paid for their work.\nThe term \"writer\" has been used as a synonym of \"author\", although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative. Author most often refers to the writer of a book.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTypes.\nWriters choose from a range of literary genres to express their ideas. Most writing can be adapted for use in another medium. For example, a writer's work may be read privately or recited or performed in a play or film. Satire for example, may be written as a poem, an essay, a film, a comic play, or a part of journalism. The writer of a letter may include elements of criticism, biography, or journalism.\nMany writers work across genres. The genre sets the parameters but all kinds of creative adaptation have been attempted: novel to film; poem to play; history to musical. Writers may begin their career in one genre and change to another. For example, historian William Dalrymple began in the genre of travel literature and also writes as a journalist. Many writers have produced both fiction and non-fiction works and others write in a genre that crosses the two. For example, writers of historical romances, such as Georgette Heyer, create characters and stories set in historical periods. In this genre, the accuracy of the history and the level of factual detail in the work both tend to be debated. Some writers write both creative fiction and serious analysis, sometimes using other names to separate their work. Dorothy Sayers, for example, wrote crime fiction but was also a playwright, essayist, translator, and critic.\nLiterary and creative.\nPoet.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt; I Will Write\nHe had done for her all that a man could,\nAnd some might say, more than a man should,\nThen was ever a flame so recklessly blown out\nOr a last goodbye so negligent as this?\n'I will write to you,' she muttered briefly,\nTilting her cheek for a polite kiss;\nThen walked away, nor ever turned about. ...\nLong letters written and mailed in her own head \u2013\nThere are no mails in a city of the dead.\nRobert Graves\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nPoets make maximum use of the language to achieve an emotional and sensory effect as well as a cognitive one. To create these effects, they use rhyme and rhythm and they also apply the properties of words with a range of other techniques such as alliteration and assonance. A common topic is love and its vicissitudes. Shakespeare's best-known love story \"Romeo and Juliet\", for example, written in a variety of poetic forms, has been performed in innumerable theaters and made into at least eight cinematic versions. John Donne is another poet renowned for his love poetry.\nIn the United Kingdom, upon advice of the Prime Minister, the monarch of the United Kingdom appoints a Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom to be the official Poet to the Monarch and government, Scotland has its own position, the Makar. Scottish people can also be appointed as the UK Poet Laureate, like Carol Ann Duffy. Duffy's work is studied in UK Schools, known for its exploration of love and feminism.\nNovelist.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Every novel worthy of the name is like another planet, whether large or small, which has its own laws just as it has its own flora and fauna. Thus, Faulkner's technique is certainly the best one with which to paint Faulkner's world, and Kafka's nightmare has produced its own myths that make it communicable. Benjamin Constant, Stendhal, Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin, Jacques Rivi\u00e8re, Radiguet, all used different techniques, took different liberties, and set themselves different tasks.\"Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, novelist\nSatirist.\nA satirist uses wit to ridicule the shortcomings of society or individuals, with the intent of revealing stupidity. Usually, the subject of the satire is a contemporary issue such as ineffective political decisions or politicians, although human vices such as greed are also a common and prevalent subject. Philosopher Voltaire wrote a satire about optimism called \"Candide\", which was subsequently turned into an opera, and many well known lyricists wrote for it. There are elements of Absurdism in \"Candide\", just as there are in the work of contemporary satirist Barry Humphries, who writes comic satire for his character Dame Edna Everage to perform on stage.\nSatirists use different techniques such as irony, sarcasm, and hyperbole to make their point and they choose from the full range of genres \u2013 the satire may be in the form of prose or poetry or dialogue in a film, for example. One of the most well-known satirists is Jonathan Swift who wrote the four-volume work \"Gulliver's Travels\" and many other satires, including \"A Modest Proposal\" and \"The Battle of the Books\". Satire has translated well to TV with writers such as Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"It is amazing to me that ... our age is almost wholly illiterate and has hardly produced one writer upon any subject.\"Jonathan Swift, satirist (1704)\nShort story writer.\nA short story writer is a writer of short stories, works of fiction that can be read in a single sitting.\nPerformative.\nLibrettist.\nLibretti (the plural of libretto) are the texts for musical works such as operas. The Venetian poet and librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte, for example, wrote the libretto for some of Mozart's greatest operas. Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa were Italian librettists who wrote for Giacomo Puccini. Most opera composers collaborate with a librettist but unusually, Richard Wagner wrote both the music and the libretti for his works himself.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Chi son? Sono poeta. Che cosa faccio? Scrivo. E come vivo? Vivo.\"\n(\"Who am I? I'm a poet. What do I do? I write. And how do I live? I live.\")Rodolpho, in Puccini's \"La boh\u00e8me\"\nLyricist.\nUsually writing in verses and choruses, a lyricist specializes in writing lyrics, the words that accompany or underscore a song or opera. Lyricists also write the words for songs. In the case of Tom Lehrer, these were satirical. Lyricist No\u00ebl Coward, who wrote musicals and songs such as \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\" and the recited song \"I Went to a Marvellous Party\", also wrote plays and films and performed on stage and screen as well. Writers of lyrics, such as these two, adapt other writers' work as well as create entirely original parts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Making lyrics feel natural, sit on music in such a way that you don't feel the effort of the author, so that they shine and bubble and rise and fall, is very, very hard to do.\"Stephen Sondheim, lyricist\nPlaywright.\nA playwright writes plays which may or may not be performed on a stage by actors. A play's narrative is driven by dialogue. Like novelists, playwrights usually explore a theme by showing how people respond to a set of circumstances. As writers, playwrights must make the language and the dialogue succeed in terms of the characters who speak the lines as well as in the play as a whole. Since most plays are performed, rather than read privately, the playwright has to produce a text that works in spoken form and can also hold an audience's attention over the period of the performance. Plays tell \"a story the audience should care about\", so writers have to cut anything that worked against that. Plays may be written in prose or verse. Shakespeare wrote plays in iambic pentameter as does Mike Bartlett in his play \"King Charles III\" (2014).\nPlaywrights also adapt or re-write other works, such as plays written earlier or literary works originally in another genre. Famous playwrights such as Henrik Ibsen or Anton Chekhov have had their works adapted several times. The plays of early Greek playwrights Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus are still performed. Adaptations of a playwright's work may be honest to the original or creatively interpreted. If the writers' purpose in re-writing the play is to make a film, they will have to prepare a screenplay. Shakespeare's plays, for example, while still regularly performed in the original form, are often adapted and abridged, especially for the cinema. An example of a creative modern adaptation of a play that nonetheless used the original writer's words, is Baz Luhrmann's version of \"Romeo and Juliet\". The amendment of the name to \"Romeo + Juliet\" indicates to the audience that the version will be different from the original. Tom Stoppard's play \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" is a play inspired by Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" that takes two of Shakespeare's most minor characters and creates a new play in which they are the protagonists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Player: \"It's what the actors do best. They have to exploit whatever talent is given to them, and their talent is dying. They can die heroically, comically, ironically, slowly, suddenly, disgustingly, charmingly or from a great height.\"Tom Stoppard, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (Act Two)\nScreenwriter.\nScreenwriters write a screenplay \u2013 or script \u2013 that provides the words for media productions such as films, television series and video games. Screenwriters may start their careers by writing the screenplay speculatively; that is, they write a script with no advance payment, solicitation or contract. On the other hand, they may be employed or commissioned to adapt the work of a playwright or novelist or other writer. Self-employed writers who are paid by contract to write are known as freelancers and screenwriters often work under this type of arrangement.\nScreenwriters, playwrights and other writers are inspired by the classic themes and often use similar and familiar plot devices to explore them. For example, in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" is a \"play within a play\", which the hero uses to demonstrate the king's guilt. Hamlet hives the co-operation of the actors to set up the play as a thing \"wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king\". Teleplay writer Joe Menosky deploys the same \"play within a play\" device in an episode of the science fiction television series '. The bronze-age playwright/hero enlists the support of a \"Star Trek\" crew member to create a play that will convince the ruler (or \"patron\" as he is called), of the futility of war.\nSpeechwriter.\nA speechwriter prepares the text for a speech to be given before a group or crowd on a specific occasion and for a specific purpose. They are often intended to be persuasive or inspiring, such as the speeches given by skilled orators like Cicero; charismatic or influential political leaders like Nelson Mandela; or for use in a court of law or parliament. The writer of the speech may be the person intended to deliver it, or it might be prepared by a person hired for the task on behalf of someone else. Such is the case when speechwriters are employed by many senior-level elected officials and executives in both government and private sectors.\nInterpretive and academic.\nBiographer.\nBiographers write an account of another person's life. Richard Ellmann (1918\u20131987), for example, was an eminent and award-winning biographer whose work focused on the Irish writers James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, and Oscar Wilde. For the Wilde biography, he won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for Biography.\nCritic.\nCritics consider and assess the extent to which a work succeeds in its purpose. The work under consideration may be literary, theatrical, musical, artistic, or architectural. In assessing the success of a work, the critic takes account of why it was done \u2013 for example, why a text was written, for whom, in what style, and under what circumstances. After making such an assessment, critics write and publish their evaluation, adding the value of their scholarship and thinking to substantiate any opinion. The theory of criticism is an area of study in itself: a good critic understands and is able to incorporate the theory behind the work they are evaluating into their assessment. Some critics are already writers in another genre. For example, they might be novelists or essayists. Influential and respected writer/critics include the art critic Charles Baudelaire (1821\u20131867) and the literary critic James Wood (born 1965), both of whom have books published containing collections of their criticism. Some critics are poor writers and produce only superficial or unsubstantiated work. Hence, while anyone can be an uninformed critic, the notable characteristics of a good critic are understanding, insight, and an ability to write well.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"We can claim with at least as much accuracy as a well-known writer claims of his little books, that no newspaper would dare print what we have to say. Are we going to be very cruel and abusive, then? By no means: on the contrary, we are going to be impartial. We have no friends \u2013 that is a great thing \u2013 and no enemies.\"Charles Baudelaire, introducing his Review of the Paris Salon of 1845\nEditor.\nAn editor prepares literary material for publication. The material may be the editor's own original work but more commonly, an editor works with the material of one or more other people. There are different types of editor. Copy editors format text to a particular style and/or correct errors in grammar and spelling without changing the text substantively. On the other hand, an editor may suggest or undertake significant changes to a text to improve its readability, sense or structure. This latter type of editor can go so far as to excise some parts of the text, add new parts, or restructure the whole. The work of editors of ancient texts or manuscripts or collections of works results in differing editions. For example, there are many editions of Shakespeare's plays by notable editors who also contribute original introductions to the resulting publication. Editors who work on journals and newspapers have varying levels of responsibility for the text. They may write original material, in particular editorials, select what is to be included from a range of items on offer, format the material, and/or fact check its accuracy.\nEncyclopaedist.\nEncyclopaedists create organised bodies of knowledge. Denis Diderot (1713\u20131784) is renowned for his contributions to the \"Encyclop\u00e9die\". The encyclopaedist Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan (1499\u20131590) was a Franciscan whose \"Historia general de las cosas de Nueva Espa\u00f1a\" is a vast encyclopedia of Mesoamerican civilization, commonly referred to as the \"Florentine Codex\", after the Italian manuscript library which holds the best-preserved copy.\nEssayist.\nEssayists write essays, which are original pieces of writing of moderate length in which the author makes a case in support of an opinion. They are usually in prose, but some writers have used poetry to present their argument.\nHistorian.\nA historian is a person who studies and writes about the past and is regarded as an authority on it. The purpose of a historian is to employ historical analysis to create coherent narratives that explain \"what happened\" and \"why or how it happened\". Professional historians typically work in colleges and universities, archival centers, government agencies, museums, and as freelance writers and consultants. Edward Gibbon's six-volume \"History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" influenced the development of historiography.\nLexicographer.\nWriters who create dictionaries are called lexicographers. One of the most famous is Samuel Johnson (1709\u20131784), whose \"Dictionary of the English Language\" was regarded not only as a great personal scholarly achievement but was also a dictionary of such pre-eminence, that would have been referred to by such writers as Jane Austen.\nResearcher/Scholar.\nResearchers and scholars who write about their discoveries and ideas sometimes have profound effects on society. Scientists and philosophers are good examples because their new ideas can revolutionise the way people think and how they behave. Three of the best known examples of such a revolutionary effect are Nicolaus Copernicus, who wrote \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" (1543); Charles Darwin, who wrote \"On the Origin of Species\" (1859); and Sigmund Freud, who wrote \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" (1899).\nThese three highly influential, and initially very controversial, works changed the way people understood their place in the world. Copernicus's heliocentric view of the cosmos displaced humans from their previously accepted place at the center of the universe; Darwin's evolutionary theory placed humans firmly within, as opposed to above, the order of manner; and Freud's ideas about the power of the unconscious mind overcame the belief that humans were consciously in control of all their own actions.\nTranslator.\nTranslators have the task of finding some equivalence in another language to a writer's meaning, intention and style. Translators whose work has had very significant cultural effect include Al-\u1e24ajj\u0101j ibn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ma\u1e6dar, who translated \"Elements\" from Greek into Arabic and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, who deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphs with the result that he could publish the first translation of the Rosetta Stone hieroglyphs in 1822. Difficulties with translation are exacerbated when words or phrases incorporate rhymes, rhythms, or puns; or when they have connotations in one language that are non-existent in another. For example, the title of \"Le Grand Meaulnes\" by Alain-Fournier is supposedly untranslatable because \"no English adjective will convey all the shades of meaning that can be read into the simple [French] word 'grand' which takes on overtones as the story progresses.\" Translators have also become a part of events where political figures who speak different languages meet to look into the relations between countries or solve political conflicts. It is highly critical for the translator to deliver the right information as a drastic impact could be caused if any error occurred.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Even if translation is impossible \u2013 we have no choice but to do it: to take the next step and start translating. ... The translator's task is to make us either forget or else enjoy the difference.\"Robert Dessaix, translator, author\nReportage.\nBlogger.\nWriters of blogs, which have appeared on the World Wide Web since the 1990s, need no authorisation to be published. The contents of these short opinion pieces or \"posts\" form a commentary on issues of specific interest to readers who can use the same technology to interact with the author, with an immediacy hitherto impossible. The ability to link to other sites means that some blog writers \u2013 and their writing \u2013 may become suddenly and unpredictably popular. Malala Yousafzai, a young Pakistani education activist, rose to prominence due to her blog for BBC.\nA blog writer is using the technology to create a message that is in some ways like a newsletter and in other ways, like a personal letter. \"The greatest difference between a blog and a photocopied school newsletter, or an annual family letter photocopied and mailed to a hundred friends, is the potential audience and the increased potential for direct communication between audience members\". Thus, as with other forms of letters the writer knows some of the readers, but one of the main differences is that \"some of the audience will be random\" and \"that presumably changes the way we [writers] write.\" It has been argued that blogs owe a debt to Renaissance essayist Michel de Montaigne, whose \"Essais\" (\"attempts\"), were published in 1580, because Montaigne \"wrote as if he were chatting to his readers: just two friends, whiling away an afternoon in conversation\".\nColumnist.\nColumnists write regular parts for newspapers and other periodicals, usually containing a lively and entertaining expression of opinion. Some columnists have had collections of their best work published as a collection in a book so that readers can re-read what would otherwise be no longer available. Columns are quite short pieces of writing so columnists often write in other genres as well. An example is the female columnist Elizabeth Farrelly, who besides being a columnist, is also an architecture critic and author of books.\nDiarist.\nWriters who record their experiences, thoughts, or emotions in a sequential form over a period of time in a diary are known as diarists. Their writings can provide valuable insights into historical periods, specific events, or individual personalities. Examples include Samuel Pepys (1633\u20131703), an English administrator and Member of Parliament, whose detailed private diary provides eyewitness accounts of events during the 17th century, most notably of the Great Fire of London. Anne Frank (1929\u20131945) was a 13-year-old Dutch girl whose diary from 1942 to 1944 records both her experiences as a persecuted Jew in World War II and an adolescent dealing with intra-family relationships.\nJournalist.\nJournalists write reports about current events after investigating them and gathering information. Some journalists write reports about predictable or scheduled events such as social or political meetings. Others are investigative journalists who need to undertake considerable research and analysis in order to write an explanation or account of something complex that was hitherto unknown or not understood. Often investigative journalists are reporting criminal or corrupt activity which puts them at risk personally and means that what it is likely that attempts may be made to attack or suppress what they write. An example is Bob Woodward, a journalist who investigated and wrote about criminal activities by the US President.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Journalism ... is a public trust, a responsibility, to report the facts with context and completeness, to speak truth to power, to hold the feet of politicians and officials to the fire of exposure, to discomfort the comfortable, to comfort those who suffer.\"Geoffrey Barker, journalist.\nMemoirist.\nWriters of memoirs produce accounts from the memories of their own lives, which are considered unusual, important, or scandalous enough to be of interest to general readers. Although meant to be factual, readers are alerted to the likelihood of some inaccuracies or bias towards an idiosyncratic perception by the choice of genre. A memoir, for example, is allowed to have a much more selective set of experiences than an autobiography which is expected to be more complete and make a greater attempt at balance. Well-known memoirists include Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane, and Giacomo Casanova.\nUtilitarian.\nGhostwriter.\nGhostwriters write for, or in the style of, someone else so the credit goes to the person on whose behalf the writing is done.\nLetter writer.\nWriters of letters use a reliable form of transmission of messages between individuals, and surviving sets of letters provide insight into the motivations, cultural contexts, and events in the lives of their writers. Peter Abelard (1079\u20131142), philosopher, logician, and theologian is known not only for the heresy contained in some of his work, and the punishment of having to burn his own book, but also for the letters he wrote to H\u00e9lo\u00efse d'Argenteuil (1090?\u20131164).\nThe letters (or epistles) of Paul the Apostle were so influential that over the two thousand years of Christian history, Paul became \"second only to Jesus in influence and the amount of discussion and interpretation generated\".\nReport writer.\nReport writers are people who gather information, organise and document it so that it can be presented to some person or authority in a position to use it as the basis of a decision. Well-written reports influence policies as well as decisions. For example, Florence Nightingale (1820\u20131910) wrote reports that were intended to effect administrative reform in matters concerning health in the army. She documented her experience in the Crimean War and showed her determination to see improvements: \"...after six months of incredible industry she had put together and written with her own hand her \"Notes affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army.\" This extraordinary composition, filling more than eight hundred closely printed pages, laying down vast principles of far-reaching reform, discussing the minutest detail of a multitude of controversial subjects, containing an enormous mass of information of the most varied kinds \u2013 military, statistical, sanitary, architectural\" became for a long time, the \"leading authority on the medical administration of armies\".\nThe logs and reports of Master mariner William Bligh contributed to his being honourably acquitted at the court-martial inquiring into the loss of .\nScribe.\nA scribe writes ideas and information on behalf of another, sometimes copying from another document, sometimes from oral instruction on behalf of an illiterate person, sometimes transcribing from another medium such as a tape recording, shorthand, or personal notes.\nBeing able to write was a rare achievement for over 500 years in Western Europe so monks who copied texts were scribes responsible for saving many texts from first times. The monasteries, where monks who knew how to read and write lived, provided an environment stable enough for writing. Irish monks, for example, came to Europe in about 600 and \"found manuscripts in places like Tours and Toulouse\" which they copied. The monastic writers also illustrated their books with highly skilled art work using gold and rare colors.\nTechnical writer.\nA technical writer prepares instructions or manuals, such as user guides or owner's manuals for users of equipment to follow. Technical writers also write different procedures for business, professional or domestic use. Since the purpose of technical writing is practical rather than creative, its most important quality is clarity. The technical writer, unlike the creative writer, is required to adhere to the relevant style guide.\nProcess and methods.\nWriting process.\nThere is a range of approaches that writers take to the task of writing. Each writer needs to find their own process and most describe it as more or less a struggle.\nSometimes writers have had the bad fortune to lose their work and have had to start again. Before the invention of photocopiers and electronic text storage, a writer's work had to be stored on paper, which meant it was very susceptible to fire in particular. (In very earlier times, writers used vellum and clay which were more robust materials.) Writers whose work was destroyed before completion include L. L. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, whose years of work were thrown into the fire by his father because he was afraid that \"his son would be thought a spy working code\".\nEssayist and historian Thomas Carlyle, lost the only copy of a manuscript for \"\" when it was mistakenly thrown into the fire by a maid. He wrote it again from the beginning. Writers usually develop a personal schedule. Angus Wilson, for example, wrote for a number of hours every morning.\nWriter's block is a relatively common experience among writers, especially professional writers, when for a period of time the writer feels unable to write for reasons other than lack of skill or commitment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Happy are they who don't doubt themselves and whose pens fly across the page\"Gustave Flaubert writing to Louise Colet\nSole.\nMost writers write alone \u2013 typically they are engaged in a solitary activity that requires them to struggle with both the concepts they are trying to express and the best way to express it. This may mean choosing the best genre or genres as well as choosing the best words. Writers often develop idiosyncratic solutions to the problem of finding the right words to put on a blank page or screen. \"Didn't Somerset Maugham also write facing a blank wall? ... Goethe couldn't write a line if there was another person anywhere in the same house, or so he said at some point.\"\nCollaborative.\nCollaborative writing means that other authors write and contribute to a part of writing. In this approach, it is highly likely the writers will collaborate on editing the part too. The more usual process is that the editing is done by an independent editor after the writer submits a draft version.\nIn some cases, such as that between a librettist and composer, a writer will collaborate with another artist on a creative work. One of the best known of these types of collaborations is that between Gilbert and Sullivan. Librettist W. S. Gilbert wrote the words for the comic operas created by the partnership.\nCommittee.\nOccasionally, a writing task is given to a committee of writers. The most well-known example is the task of translating the Bible into English, sponsored by King James VI of England in 1604 and accomplished by six committees, some in Cambridge and some in Oxford, who were allocated different sections of the text. The resulting Authorized King James Version, published in 1611, has been described as an \"everlasting miracle\" because its writers (that is, its Translators) sought to \"hold themselves consciously poised between the claims of accessibility and beauty, plainness and richness, simplicity and majesty, the people and the king\", with the result that the language communicates itself \"in a way which is quite unaffected, neither literary nor academic, not historical, nor reconstructionist, but transmitting a nearly incredible immediacy from one end of human civilisation to another.\"\nMultimedia.\nSome writers support the verbal part of their work with images or graphics that are an integral part of the way their ideas are communicated. William Blake is one of rare poets who created his own paintings and drawings as integral parts of works such as his \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\". Cartoonists are writers whose work depends heavily on hand drawn imagery. Other writers, especially writers for children, incorporate painting or drawing in more or less sophisticated ways. Shaun Tan, for example, is a writer who uses imagery extensively, sometimes combining fact, fiction and illustration, sometimes for a didactic purpose, sometimes on commission. Children's writers Beatrix Potter, May Gibbs, and Theodor Seuss Geisel are as well known for their illustrations as for their texts.\nCrowd sourced.\nSome writers contribute very small sections to a part of writing that cumulates as a result. This method is particularly suited to very large works, such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias. The best known example of the former is the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", under the editorship of lexicographer James Murray, who was provided with the prolific and helpful contributions of W.C. Minor, at the time an inmate of a hospital for the criminally insane.\nThe best known example of the latter \u2013 an encyclopaedia that is crowdsourced \u2013 is Wikipedia, which relies on millions of writers and editors such as Simon Pulsifer worldwide.\nMotivations.\nWriters have many different reasons for writing, among which is usually some combination of self-expression and recording facts, history or research results. The many physician writers, for example, have combined their observation and knowledge of the human condition with their desire to write and contributed many poems, plays, translations, essays and other texts. Some writers write extensively on their motivation and on the likely motivations of other writers. For example, George Orwell's essay \"Why I Write\" (1946) takes this as its subject. As to \"what constitutes success or failure to a writer\", it has been described as \"a complicated business, where the material rubs up against the spiritual, and psychology plays a big part\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The moral I draw is that the writer should seek his reward in the pleasure of his work and in release from the burden of this thoughts; and, indifferent to aught else, care nothing for praise or censure, failure or success.\"W. Somerset Maugham in \"The Moon and Sixpence\" (1919) \nCommand.\nSome writers are the authors of specific military orders whose clarity will determine the outcome of a battle. Among the most controversial and unsuccessful was Lord Raglan's order at the Charge of the Light Brigade, which being vague and misinterpreted, led to defeat with many casualties.\nDevelop skill/explore ideas.\nSome writers use the writing task to develop their own skill (in writing itself or in another area of knowledge) or explore an idea while they are producing a piece of writing. Philologist J. R. R. Tolkien, for example, created a new language for his fantasy books.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; \"For me the private act of poetry writing is songwriting, confessional, diary-keeping, speculation, problem-solving, storytelling, therapy, anger management, craftsmanship, relaxation, concentration and spiritual adventure all in one inexpensive package.\"Stephen Fry, author, poet, playwright, screenwriter, journalist\nEntertain.\nSome genres are a particularly appropriate choice for writers whose chief purpose is to entertain. Among them are limericks, many comics and thrillers. Writers of children's literature seek to entertain children but are also usually mindful of the educative function of their work as well.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\"I think that I shall never see\"\n\"a billboard lovely as a tree;\"\n\"Indeed, unless the billboards fall\"\n\"I'll never see a tree at all.\"\nOgden Nash, humorous poet, reworking a poem by Joyce Kilmer for comic effect.&lt;/poem&gt;\nInfluence.\nAnger has motivated many writers, including Martin Luther, angry at religious corruption, who wrote the \"Ninety-five Theses\" in 1517, to reform the church, and \u00c9mile Zola (1840\u20131902) who wrote the public letter, \"J'Accuse\" in 1898 to bring public attention to government injustice, as a consequence of which he had to flee to England from his native France. Such writers have affected ideas, opinion or policy significantly.\nPayment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nEven though he is in love with the same woman, Cyrano helps his inarticulate friend, Rageneau, to woo her by writing on his behalf ...\nCYRANO: What hour is it now, Ragueneau?\nRAGUENEAU (stopping short in the act of thrusting to look at the clock): Five minutes after six!...'I touch!' (He straightens himself): ...Oh! to write a ballade!\nRAGUENEAU: Ten minutes after six.\nCYRANO: (nervously seating himself at Ragueneau's table, and drawing some paper toward him): A pen!. . .\nRAGUENEAU (giving him the one from behind his ear): Here \u2013 a swan's quill.\nCYRANO (taking up the pen, and motioning Ragueneau away): Hush! (To himself): I will write, fold it, give it her, and fly! (Throws down the pen): Coward! ...But strike me dead if I dare to speak to her, ...ay, even one single word! (To Ragueneau): What time is it?\nRAGUENEAU: A quarter after six! ...\nCYRANO (striking his breast): Ay-a single word of all those here! here! But writing, 'tis easier done... (He takes up the pen): Go to, I will write it, that love-letter! Oh! I have writ it and rewrit it in my own mind so oft that it lies there ready for pen and ink; and if I lay but my soul by my letter-sheet, 'tis naught to do but to copy from it. (He writes. ...)Edmond Rostand, \"Cyrano de Bergerac\"Act II, Scene 2, (3)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nWriters may write a particular piece for payment (even if at other times, they write for another reason), such as when they are commissioned to create a new work, transcribe an original one, translate another writer's work, or write for someone who is illiterate or inarticulate. In some cases, writing has been the only way an individual could earn an income. Frances Trollope is an example of women who wrote to save herself and her family from penury, at a time when there were very few socially acceptable employment opportunities for them. Her book about her experiences in the United States, called \"Domestic Manners of the Americans\" became a great success, \"even though she was over fifty and had never written before in her life\" after which \"she continued to write hard, carrying this on almost entirely before breakfast\". According to her writer son Anthony Trollope \"her books saved the family from ruin\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; \"I write for two reasons; partly to make money and partly to win the respect of people whom I respect.\"E. M. Forster, novelist, essayist, librettist\nTeach.\nAristotle, who was tutor to Alexander the Great, wrote to support his teaching. He wrote two treatises for the young prince: \"On Monarchy\", and \"On Colonies\" and his dialogues also appear to have been written either \"as lecture notes or discussion papers for use in his philosophy school at the Athens Lyceum between 334 and 323 BC.\" They encompass both his 'scientific' writings (metaphysics, physics, biology, meteorology, and astronomy, as well as logic and argument) the 'non-scientific' works (poetry, oratory, ethics, and politics), and \"major elements in traditional Greek and Roman education\".\nWriters of textbooks also use writing to teach and there are numerous instructional guides to writing itself. For example, many people will find it necessary to make a speech \"in the service of your company, church, civic club, political party, or other organization\" and so, instructional writers have produced texts and guides for speechmaking.\nTell a story.\nMany writers use their skill to tell the story of their people, community or cultural tradition, especially one with a personal significance. Examples include Shmuel Yosef Agnon; Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias; Doris Lessing; Toni Morrison; Isaac Bashevis Singer; and Patrick White.\nWriters such as Mario Vargas Llosa, Herta M\u00fcller, and Erich Maria Remarque write about the effect of conflict, dispossession and war.\nSeek a lover.\nWriters use prose, poetry, and letters as part of courtship rituals. Edmond Rostand's play \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", written in verse, is about both the power of love and the power of the self-doubting writer/hero's writing talent.\nAuthorship.\nPen names.\nWriters sometimes use a pseudonym, otherwise known as a pen name or \"nom de plume\". The reasons they do this include to separate their writing from other work (or other types of writing) for which they are known; to enhance the possibility of publication by reducing prejudice (such as against women writers or writers of a particular race); to reduce personal risk (such as political risks from individuals, groups or states that disagree with them); or to make their name better suit another language.\nExamples of well-known writers who used a pen name include: George Eliot (1819\u20131880), whose real name was Mary Anne (or Marian) Evans; George Orwell (1903\u20131950), whose real name was Eric Blair; George Sand (1804\u20131876), whose real name was Lucile Aurore Dupin; Dr. Seuss (1904\u20131991), whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel; Stendhal (1783\u20131842), whose real name was Marie-Henri Beyle; and Mark Twain (1835\u20131910), whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens.\nApart from the large numbers of works attributable only to \"Anonymous\", there are a large number of writers who were once known and are now unknown. Efforts are made to find and re-publish these writers' works. One example is the publication of books like \"Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers\" (a 2010 reproduction of a pre-1923 publication) by \"Anonymous\". Another example is the founding of a Library and Study Centre for the Study of Early English Women's Writing in Chawton, England.\nFictional writers.\nSome fictional writers are very well known because of the strength of their characterization by the real writer or the significance of their role as writer in the plot of a work. Examples of this type of fictional writer include Edward Casaubon, a fictional scholar in George Eliot's \"Middlemarch\", and Edwin Reardon, a fictional writer in George Gissing's \"New Grub Street\". Casaubon's efforts to complete an authoritative study affect the decisions taken by the protagonists in Eliot's novel and inspire significant parts of the plot. In Gissing's work, Reardon's efforts to produce high quality writing put him in conflict with another character, who takes a more commercial approach. Robinson Crusoe is a fictional writer who was originally credited by the real writer (Daniel Defoe) as being the author of the confessional letters in the work of the same name. Bridget Jones is a comparable fictional diarist created by writer Helen Fielding. Both works became well-known and popular; their protagonists and story were developed further through many adaptations, including film versions. Cyrano de Bergerac was a real writer who created a fictional character with his own name. The \"Sibylline Books\", a collection of prophecies were supposed to have been purchased from the Cumaean Sibyl by the last king of Rome. Since they were consulted during periods of crisis, it could be said that they are a case of real works created by a fictional writer.\nWriters of sacred texts.\nReligious texts or scriptures are the texts which different religious traditions consider to be sacred, or of central importance to their religious tradition. Some religions and spiritual movements believe that their sacred texts are divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired, while others have individual authors.\nControversial writing.\nSkilled writers influence ideas and society, so there are many instances where a writer's work or opinion has been unwelcome and controversial. In some cases, they have been persecuted or punished. Aware that their writing will cause controversy or put themselves and others into danger, some writers self-censor; or withhold their work from publication; or hide their manuscripts; or use some other technique to preserve and protect their work. Two of the most famous examples are Leonardo da Vinci and Charles Darwin. Leonardo \"had the habit of conversing with himself in his writings and of putting his thoughts into the clearest and most simple form\". He used \"left-handed or mirror writing\" (a technique described as \"so characteristic of him\") to protect his scientific research from other readers. The fear of persecution, social disgrace, and being proved incorrect are regarded as contributing factors to Darwin's delaying the publication of his radical and influential work \"On the Origin of Species\".\nOne of the results of controversies caused by a writer's work is scandal, which is a negative public reaction that causes damage to reputation and depends on public outrage. It has been said that it is possible to scandalise the public because the public \"wants to be shocked in order to confirm its own sense of virtue\". The scandal may be caused by what the writer wrote or by the style in which it was written. In either case, the content or the style is likely to have broken with tradition or expectation. Making such a departure may in fact, be part of the writer's intention or at least, part of the result of introducing innovations into the genre in which they are working. For example, novelist D H Lawrence challenged ideas of what was acceptable as well as what was expected in form. These may be regarded as literary scandals, just as, in a different way, are the scandals involving writers who mislead the public about their identity, such as Norma Khouri or Helen Darville who, in deceiving the public, are considered to have committed fraud.\nWriters may also cause the more usual type of scandal \u2013 whereby the public is outraged by the opinions, behaviour or life of the individual (an experience not limited to writers). Poet Paul Verlaine outraged society with his behaviour and treatment of his wife and child as well as his lover. Among the many writers whose writing or life was affected by scandals are Oscar Wilde, Lord Byron, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and H. G. Wells. One of the most famously scandalous writers was the Marquis de Sade who offended the public both by his writings \"and\" by his behaviour.\nPunishment.\nThe consequence of scandal for a writer may be censorship or discrediting of the work, or social ostracism of its creator. In some instances, punishment, persecution, or prison follow. The list of journalists killed in Europe, list of journalists killed in the United States and the list of journalists killed in Russia are examples. Others include:\nProtection and representation.\nThe organisation Reporters Without Borders (also known by its French name: Reporters Sans Fronti\u00e8res) was set up to help protect writers and advocate on their behalf.\nThe professional and industrial interests of writers are represented by various national or regional guilds or unions. Examples include writers guilds in Australia and Great Britain and unions in Arabia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Canada, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Moldova, Philippines, Poland, Quebec, Romania, Russia, Sudan, and Ukraine. In the United States, there is both a writers guild and a National Writers Union.\nAwards.\nThere are many awards for writers whose writing has been adjudged excellent. Among them are the many literary awards given by individual countries, such as the Prix Goncourt and the Pulitzer Prize, as well as international awards such as the Nobel Prize in Literature. Russian writer Boris Pasternak (1890\u20131960), under pressure from his government, reluctantly declined the Nobel Prize that he won in 1958.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Texts on Wikisource:"}

His film career spanned from the early 1920s through the 1950s, initially as a leading man, though he was better known for his character acting. He was a well-known member of John Ford\u2019s Stock Company, appearing in 12 of the director\u2019s films, seven of which co-starred John Wayne.\nFor his performance as a treacherous Irish Republican in the 1935 film \"The Informer\", he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role in \"The Quiet Man,\" both directed by Ford. In 1960, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nEarly life and education.\nMcLaglen claimed to have been born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, although his birth certificate records 505 Commercial Road, Stepney in the East End of London as his true birthplace. His father, Andrew Charles Albert Mclaglen, was a missionary in the Free Protestant Church in South Africa, and was later a bishop of the Free Protestant Episcopal Church of England.\nThe McLaglen family is ultimately of Scottish origin, descended from a MacLachlan who settled in South Africa in the 19th century. The name was rendered into McLaglen from Dutch pronunciation. A.C.A. McLaglen was christened Andries Carel Albertus McLaglen in Cape Town on 4 April 1851.\nVictor had eight brothers and a sister. Four of his brothers also became actors: Arthur, an actor and sculptor, and Clifford, Cyril, and Kenneth.\nHis other siblings included Frederick, Lewis, and a sister, Lily. Another brother, Sydney Temple Leopold McLaglen, who appeared in one film, gained notoriety prior to World War I as a showman and self-proclaimed world jujutsu champion, who authored a book on the subject.\nVictor moved with his family to South Africa for a time, where his father was Bishop of Claremont.\nArmy service and boxing career.\nMcLaglen left home at 14 to join the British Army with the intention of fighting in the Second Boer War, but much to his chagrin, he was stationed at Windsor Castle in the Life Guards and was later forced to leave the army when his true age was discovered.\nFour years later, he moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where he became a local celebrity, earning a living as a wrestler and heavyweight boxer, with several notable wins in the ring. He also briefly served as a constable in the Winnipeg Police Force in 1907.\nOne of his most famous fights was against heavyweight champion Jack Johnson in a six-round exhibition bout at the Vancouver Athletic Club on 10 March 1909. This was Johnson's first bout since winning the heavyweight title from Tommy Burns. Between bouts, McLaglen toured with a circus, which offered $25 to anyone who could go three rounds with him.\nHe returned to Britain in 1913, and during the First World War was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 10th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, on 19 June 1915. He landed at Basra on 10 August 1916 and served as an assistant provost marshal in Mesopotamia, ending the war as a temporary captain. (He may also have seen some service with the Royal Irish Fusiliers.) He continued boxing, and was named heavyweight champion of the British Army in 1918.\nAfter the war, he continued boxing, including a defeat at the hands of British champion Frank Goddard. His final fight was a loss by knockout to Arthur Townley in October 1920. He finished his professional career with a record of 16 wins, eight losses, and a draw.\nActing career.\nBritain.\nMcLaglen was visiting a sporting club when spotted by a film producer who was looking for a boxer to play the lead in a film, \"The Call of the Road\" (1920). Although McLaglen had never acted before, he auditioned and got the part.\nHe was in the adventure films: \"Corinthian Jack\" (1921) and \"The Prey of the Dragon\" (1921). He followed it with \"The Sport of Kings\" (1921). Donald Crisp cast him in \"The Glorious Adventure\" (1922) and he was in \"A Romance of Old Baghdad\" (1922), \"Little Brother of God\" (1922), \"A Sailor Tramp\" (1922), \"The Crimson Circle\" (1922), \"The Romany\" (1922), and \"Heartstrings\" (1922).\nMcLaglen played leads in \"M'Lord of the White Road\" (1923), \"In the Blood\" (1923), \"The Boatswain's Mate\" (1923), \"Women and Diamonds\" (1924), and \"The Gay Corinthian\" (1924). He was in \"The Passionate Adventure\" (1924), co-written by Alfred Hitchcock, and \"The Beloved Brute\" (1924), \"The Hunted Woman\" (1925), and \"Percy\" (1925).\nHollywood.\nMcLaglen's career took a surprise turn in 1925 when he moved to Hollywood. He became a popular character actor, with a particular knack for playing drunks. He also usually played Irishmen, leading many film fans to mistakenly assume he was Irish rather than English. McLaglen played one of the titular characters of \"The Unholy Three\" (1925) in Lon Chaney Sr.'s original silent version of the macabre crime drama.\nMcLaglen had a support part in \"Winds of Chance\" (1925), directed by Frank Lloyd, then made \"The Fighting Heart\" (1925) at Fox, directed by John Ford. Ford would have a major impact on McLaglen's career. McLaglen was in \"The Isle of Retribution\" (1925), \"Men of Steel\" (1926), and \"Beau Geste\" (1926), playing Hank in the last.\n\"What Price Glory?\" and stardom.\nMcLaglen was the top-billed leading man in director Raoul Walsh's First World War classic \"What Price Glory?\" (1926) with Edmund Lowe and Dolores del R\u00edo. The film was a huge success, making over $2 million, and Fox signed McLaglen to a long-term contract.\nFox put McLaglen in \"The Loves of Carmen\" (1927) with del R\u00edo, directed by Walsh. He was top-billed in \"Mother Machree\" (1928), directed by Ford. He was top-billed in \"A Girl in Every Port\" (1928), co-starring Robert Armstrong and Louise Brooks. He starred in \"Hangman's House\" (1928) for Ford, a romantic drama set in Ireland, and \"The River Pirate\" (1928), and \"Captain Lash\" (1929). McLaglen then made two films for Ford: \"Strong Boy\" (1929) and \"The Black Watch\" (1929).\nTalking movies.\nMcLaglen was one of many Fox stars who had cameos in the musical \"Happy Days\" (1929). He was reunited with Edmund Lowe and Raoul Walsh in a sequel to \"What Price Glory?\", \"The Cock-Eyed World\" (1929), which was another huge success at the box office.\nMcLaglen made a musical with Walsh, \"Hot for Paris\" (1930), then made \"On the Level\" (1930). \"A Devil with Women\" (1931) was a buddy comedy with Humphrey Bogart in which Bogart played McLaglen's sidekick. He was borrowed by Paramount for \"Dishonored\" (1931), starring Marlene Dietrich and directed by Joseph von Sternberg. He was in \"Not Exactly Gentlemen\" (1931) and had a cameo in the short film \"The Stolen Jools\" (1931). McLaglen, Lowe, and Walsh reunited for a second sequel to \"What Price Glory?\", \"Women of All Nations\" (1931). He was in \"Annabelle's Affairs\" (1931), \"Wicked\" (1931), \"The Gay Caballero\" (1932), and \"Devil's Lottery\" (1932). McLaglen and Lowe went to Paramount for \"Guilty as Hell\" (1932).\nBack at Fox, he was in \"Rackety Rax\" (1932) then made a fourth \"What Price Glory?\" film with Lowe, \"Hot Pepper\" (1933). McLaglen starred in \"Laughing at Life\" (1933) and returned to Britain to make \"Dick Turpin\" (1933).\nMcLaglen starred opposite Boris Karloff's crazed religious fanatic in John Ford's \"The Lost Patrol\" (1934) at RKO, a picture about desperate soldiers gradually losing their minds fighting Arabs in the desert of what is now Iraq.\nAt Paramount, McLaglen and Lowe were in \"No More Women\" (1934) (a non-\"What Price Glory?\" film), then McLaglen made \"Wharf Angel\" (1934). He was one of many stars in \"Murder at the Vanities\" (1934). At Columbia, McLaglen starred in \"The Captain Hates the Sea\" (1934) with John Gilbert. Lowe and he reunited at Fox for \"Under Pressure\" (1935) (directed by Walsh) and \"The Great Hotel Murder\" (1935).\n\"The Informer\".\nAnother highlight of his career was winning an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Ford's \"The Informer\" (1935), shot at RKO, based on a novel of the same name by Liam O'Flaherty. In 1945, McLaglen said that winning the Oscar had no economic benefit and that he did not know where it was because his son had taken it to college for use as a paperweight.\nBack at Fox \u2013 now 20th Century Fox \u2013 McLaglen made \"Professional Soldier\" (1935) with Freddie Bartholomew. At Paramount, he was teamed with Mae West in \"Klondike Annie\" (1936), then he went back to Fox for \"Under Two Flags\" (1936) with Rosalind Russell and Ronald Colman.\nMcLaglen starred in \"The Magnificent Brute\" (1936) for Universal, \"Sea Devils\" (1937) for RKO, and \"Nancy Steele Is Missing!\" (1937) for Fox. He stayed at Fox to support Robert Taylor in \"This Is My Affair\" (1937), and notably, Shirley Temple in \"Wee Willie Winkie\" (1937) directed by John Ford at Fox. He had a cameo in \"Ali Baba Goes to Town\" (1937). Brian Donlevy and he made a comedy \"Battle of Broadway\" (1938) at Fox, then he went to Universal for \"The Devil's Party\" (1938).\n\"Gunga Din\".\nMcLaglen returned to Britain for \"We're Going to Be Rich\" (1938) with Gracie Fields. Back in Hollywood, he did some films for RKO: \"Pacific Liner\" (1939) and \"Gunga Din\" (1939). The latter, with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., was an adventure epic loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's poem that served as the template decades later for \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" (1984).\nHe supported Nelson Eddy in \"Let Freedom Ring\" (1939) at MGM, and was in \"Ex-Champ\" (1939). He supported Brian Aherne in \"Captain Fury\" (1939), and starred in \"Full Confession\" (1939) for John Farrow at RKO, the latter film being somewhat a remake of \"The Informer\".\nAt Universal, McLaglen teamed with Basil Rathbone in \"Rio\" (1939) and Jackie Cooper in \"The Big Guy\" (1939). He was top-billed in Edward Small's South Seas adventure, \"South of Pago Pago\" (1940). He remained top-billed for \"Diamond Frontier\" (1940) and \"Broadway Limited\" (1941).\nMcLaglen and Lowe reprised their roles from \"What Price Glory?\" in the radio program \"Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt\", broadcast on the Blue Network (28 September 1941 \u2013 25 January 1942, and on NBC 13 February 1942 \u2013 3 April 1942).\nMcLaglen and Lowe then played basically the same roles, but under different names in \"Call Out the Marines\" (1942) at RKO. He starred in \"Powder Town\" (1942), and went to Fox to support Gene Tierney in \"China Girl\" (1942). He was one of many stars in \"Forever and a Day\" (1943), and had a support role in \"Tampico\" (1943) and \"Roger Touhy, Gangster\" (1944). McLaglen was a villain in Bob Hope's \"The Princess and the Pirate\" (1944), and he was in \"Rough, Tough and Ready\" (1945).\nSupporting actor.\nMcLaglen began to be exclusively a supporting actor, with parts in \"Love, Honor and Goodbye\" (1945), \"Whistle Stop\" (1946) with George Raft and Ava Gardner, \"Calendar Girl\" (1947), \"The Michigan Kid\" (1947), and \"The Foxes of Harrow\" (1947).\nMcLaglen was back with John Ford for \"Fort Apache\" (1948) with John Wayne and Henry Fonda. It was very much a support part, as a cavalry sergeant, but so well received that McLaglen basically reprised it in the other two films in the Ford-Wayne \"cavalry trilogy\": \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" (1949) and \"Rio Grande\" (1950) with Maureen O'Hara and Ben Johnson.\nMcLaglen was later nominated for another Oscar, this time for a Best Supporting Actor for his role opposite John Wayne in \"The Quiet Man\" (1952). He continued to be in demand as a support actor in action films: \"Fair Wind to Java\" (1953) with Fred MacMurray and \"Prince Valiant\" (1954) with James Mason and Robert Wagner. He went to Britain for \"Trouble in the Glen\" (1954), an unsuccessful attempt to do for Scotland what \"The Quiet Man\" did for Ireland. Back in Hollywood, he was in \"Many Rivers to Cross\" (1955) at MGM with Robert Taylor and Eleanor Parker.\nLater career.\nMcLaglen had a rare late-career lead role in \"City of Shadows\" (1955) at Republic with Patricia Crowley, and he was second-billed in \"Bengazi\" (1955), but he went back to supports with \"Lady Godiva of Coventry\" (1955). He had a cameo in \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956) with David Niven and Cantinflas, then had another lead in \"The Abductors\" (1957), directed by his son, Andrew V. McLaglen.\nToward the end of his career, McLaglen made several guest appearances on television, particularly in Western series such as \"Have Gun, Will Travel\" and \"Rawhide\". The episodes in which McLaglen guest-starred were both directed by his son, Andrew, who later became a film director, frequently directing John Wayne.\nHe went to Italy for \"Gli Italiani sono matti\", and had a good part in \"Sea Fury\" (1958) with Stanley Baker.\nActivism.\nIn 1933, he founded the California Light Horse Regiment, which included a \"riding parade club, a polo-playing group and a precision motorcycle contingent\". He described it in a press interview as promoting \"Americanism\". He said it was organized to fight communists and others \"opposed to the American ideal\", both inside and outside the country. McLaglen was attacked by some on the left as fascist, which he denied. He said he was a \"patriot of the good old-fashioned American kind\".\nPersonal life.\nIn 1935, McLaglen spent a reported $40,000 (equal to $ today) to build his own stadium near Riverside Drive and Hyperion Avenue, near Griffith Park and the Atwater Village neighborhood of Los Angeles. The stadium was used for football and many other activities. The Los Angeles River flood of 1938 seriously damaged the stadium, and it fell into disuse thereafter. In 1941, he was selected as the grand marshal of the Clovis Rodeo parade in Clovis, California.\nMcLaglen was married three times. He first married Enid Lamont in 1919. The couple had two sons, Andrew, Walter, and one daughter, Sheila. Andrew McLaglen was a television and film director who worked on several film projects with John Wayne. Andrew's children, Mary and Josh McLaglen, are both film producers and directors. Sheila's daughter, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, is a television director. Enid Lamont McLaglen died in 1942 as a result of a horse-riding accident.\nHis second marriage was to Suzanne M. Brueggeman. That marriage lasted from 1943 until 1948. His third and final marriage was to divorc\u00e9e Margaret McNichols Pumphrey, a Seattle socialite he married in 1948. They remained married until his death from congestive heart failure in 1959.\nHe had by that time become a naturalized U.S. citizen. His cremated remains are interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, in the Garden of Memory, Columbarium of Eternal Light.\nOn 8 February 1960, McLaglen received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1735 Vine Street, for his contributions to the motion-picture industry.\nMcLaglen spoke five languages, including Arabic.\nReferences.\nhttps:// from BoxRec (registration required) \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The primary members of this group are Pantalone, il Dottore, and il Capitano. Pantalone and il Dottore are the alter ego of each other: Pantalone being the decadent wealthy merchant, and il Dottore being the decadent erudite.\nThey are overwhelmingly the antagonists, opposing the love of the ; the comic ending is produced when the Zanni manage to overcome them and unite the lovers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45364", "revid": "1313367066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45364", "title": "Pantalone", "text": "Principal character in commedia dell'arte\nPantalone (), spelled Pantaloon in English, is one of the most important principal characters found in commedia dell'arte. With his exceptional greed and status at the top of the social order, Pantalone is \"money\" in the \"commedia\" world. His full name, including family name, is \"Pantalon de' Bisognosi\", Italian for 'Pantalone of the Needy'.\nCharacter.\nPantalone originated as part of a master/servant duo and was the original \"Il Magnifico\" stock character. Carlo Goldoni, in his memoirs, named Pantalone as one of the four primary commedia dell'arte characters. Among other things, Pantalone is a character of Venetians; one theory is that his name derives from Saint Pantaleon (\"San Pantalone\"), a popular saint in Venice. Another theory is that his name derives from Venetian merchants who were called Piantaleoni. While the theories of the St. Pantaleone and the lion of St. Mark are common, they are both now considered unlikely origins, and the true origin is unknown. The name Pantaloon generally means 'old fool' or 'dotard'. The role of Pantalone is usually spoken entirely in the Venetian language. The character of Pantalone is entirely based on currency and ego, for he has the highest regard for his intelligence, \"but at every step he becomes the butt for every conceivable kind of trick\". With little else to occupy his thoughts after a life as a tradesman or merchant, Pantalone is the metaphorical representation of money in the \"commedia\" world. While the social standing of merchants may have changed through many centuries, the intent for Pantalone was to ensure that he had the status that allowed him to meddle in the affairs of others. Pantalone is usually the father to one of the \"innamorati\" (the lovers), another stock character found in \"commedia\". He is driven to keep his child and their respective lover apart. Pantalone is presented either as a widower or bachelor, and despite his age, makes numerous passes at the women within the \"commedia\" world, \"though he is always rejected\". Pantalone never forgets a deal and his merit is based on actions, not words. He is also described as being petty, and he never forgets or forgives even the smallest things.\nPantalone is characterized as loving his money and having emotional extremes. With his sinister and often inhumane treatment towards his fellows, Pantalone is perceived to be a pivotal part of \"commedia\". His importance is represented in almost every \"commedia\" production; often placing him at the beginning of the comedy. In a \"commedia\" drama, many Zanni or \"lazzi\" routines will begin by an action delivered by Pantalone himself. Pantalone is described as being too self-absorbed to notice and interact much with the audience, but he is so oblivious that it serves the same purpose.\nDue to his portrayal as an older, single man, it might be claimed that Pantalone is a very one-sided representation of old age. However, he is actually a very rounded and multifaceted depiction of the suggestive natures of old age.\nPantalone's inappropriate enthusiasm for the young ladies inside the \"commedia\" world is abundantly borne out in the previously mentioned \"Capriccii\". \"Of all the twenty-seven pieces, ten allude to ladies in their titles alone, either just as a lady (\"donna\"), or as spouse (\"mogier\"), house cleaner and courtesan (\"Massara\", \"Padrona\") whores (\"puttane\"), sweetheart (\"morosa\"), and darling (\"innamorata\").\"\nSexual symbolism is very prominent as illustrated in \"Della bellezza, and crudelt\u00e0 d'una donna\", one elderly person communicates along these lines:\n\"vorria d'amante libero\"\n\"farme servo, e desidero\"\n\"nel mar de l'appetito\"\n\"tegnir el timon dritto\"\n\"al vassello, e d'accorto\"\n\"vorria ficcarme in porto\"\n\"[I would like, as a free lover,\"\n\"to help myself, and I desire\"\n\"in the sea of appetite\"\n\"to keep the ship's rudder\"\n\"straight, and smartly,\"\n\"would I like to thrust myself into port].\"\nStance.\nThe traditional Pantalone stance is that of a hunch-backed old man. He walks with his hips forward, allowing him to make larger strides when he walks. The hunched shape restricts his legs, which are bent and turned out at the knees. The feet have the heels together with the toes facing apart. His hands and feet move quickly, although his body is stiff, and his head is constantly moving. When he walks, his feet should be picked up more than would occur naturally. Pantalone is slow moving, and he has bouts of agility when there is high emotion, but it is followed by asthmatic breathing and panting. Pantalone is often short and skinny. A lot of Pantalone's comedy stems from the fact that his excitable actions greatly contradict the senile position that the actor takes. He often falls backwards, generally to bad news related in some way or another to his financials. When this occurs, he is often amusingly \"turtle-like\" and is often stuck in that position until assisted. Pantalone can do all of the movements of the other characters, but they are greatly hindered because of his old age. None of Pantalone's physical actions should look easy, for his is truly \"the oldest of the old\". In the well-known \"all the world's a stage\" speech in Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" (II, vii), Jacques describes the second-last stage of life as \"the lean and slippered pantaloon\".\nCostume.\nPantalone's costume was designed with the inappropriateness intended to comically entertain. The costume for Pantalone is characterized by the use of red for almost the entire costume. The characteristics of the costume also include a Greek style hat, a jacket, a pair of long trousers or breeches with stockings, a tight jacket, a woollen skullcap, a robe or cape, a prominent codpiece or strategically placed coin purse, a black and red robe and yellow Turkish slippers. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a sword or dagger and gold medallion often accompanied the purse. The Pantalone mask is a half-mask with accents on bony structure, big, bushy eyebrows, a long, hooked nose, a mustache, and a long, pointed or forked beard. He occasionally is noted as having horn spectacles. He occasionally carries a walking stick, but it is used more as an aggravating weapon than an actual walking tool. Because of his skinny legs, Pantalone is often portrayed wearing trousers rather than knee-breeches (which Jacques refers to as \"his youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide/For his shrunk shank\"). He therefore became the origin of the name of a type of trouser called \"pantaloons\", which was later shortened to \"pants\".\nRelated.\nAngela Carter's \"The Bloody Chamber\" (in the short story \"Puss in Boots\") gives another representation of Pantalone. The interpretation uses the spelling 'Pantaloon', but he follows a very similar description and ends up dead.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for his 1996 novel \"Infinite Jest\", which \"Time\" magazine named one of the 100 best English-language novels published from 1923 to 2005. In 2008, David Ulin wrote for the \"Los Angeles Times\" that Wallace was \"one of the most influential and innovative writers of the last twenty years\".\nWallace grew up in Illinois. He graduated from Amherst College and the University of Arizona. His honors thesis at Amherst was adapted into his debut novel \"The Broom of the System\" (1987). In his writing, Wallace intentionally avoided tropes of postmodern art such as irony or forms of metafiction, saying in 1990 that they were \"agents of a great despair and stasis\" in contemporary American culture. \"Infinite Jest\", his second novel, is known for its unconventional narrative structure and extensive use of endnotes.\nWallace published three short story collections: \"Girl with Curious Hair\" (1989), \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\" (1999) and \"\" (2004). His short stories and essays were published in outlets like \"The New Yorker\" and \"Rolling Stone\" magazines, and three collections of his essays were published as books: \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again\" (1997), \"Consider the Lobster\" (2005) and \"Both Flesh and Not\" (2012). Wallace also taught English and creative writing at Emerson College, Illinois State University, and Pomona College.\nIn 2008, after struggling with depression for many years, Wallace died by suicide at age 46. His unfinished novel \"The Pale King\" was published in 2011 and was a finalist for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.\nEarly life and education.\nDavid Foster Wallace was born in Ithaca, New York, to Sally Jean Wallace (n\u00e9e\u00a0Foster) and James Donald Wallace. The family moved to Champaign\u2013Urbana, Illinois, where he was raised along with his younger sister, Amy Wallace-Havens. His father was a philosophy professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His mother was an English professor at Parkland College, a community college in Champaign, which recognized her work with a \"Professor of the Year\" award in 1996. From fourth grade, Wallace lived with his family in Urbana, where he attended Yankee Ridge Elementary School, Brookens Junior High School and Urbana High School.\nAs an adolescent, Wallace was a regionally ranked junior tennis player. He wrote about this period in the essay \"Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley\", originally published in \"Harper's Magazine\" as \"Tennis, Trigonometry, Tornadoes\". Although his parents were atheists, Wallace twice attempted to join the Catholic Church, but \"flunk[ed] the period of inquiry\". He later attended a Mennonite church.\nWallace attended Amherst College, his father's alma mater, where he majored in English and philosophy and graduated \"summa cum laude\" in 1985. Among other extracurricular activities, he participated in glee club; his sister recalls that he \"had a lovely singing voice\". In studying philosophy, Wallace pursued modal logic and mathematics, and presented in 1985 a senior thesis in philosophy and modal logic that was awarded the Gail Kennedy Memorial Prize and posthumously published as \"Fate, Time, and Language: An Essay on Free Will\" (2010).\nWallace adapted his honors thesis in English as the manuscript of his first novel, \"The Broom of the System\" (1987), and committed to being a writer. He told David Lipsky: \"Writing \"The Broom of the System\", I felt like I was using 97 percent of me, whereas philosophy was using 50 percent.\" Wallace completed a Master of Fine Arts degree in creative writing at the University of Arizona in 1987. He moved to Massachusetts to attend graduate school in philosophy at Harvard University, but soon left the program.\nWork.\nCareer.\n\"The Broom of the System\" (1987) garnered national attention and critical praise. In \"The New York Times\", Caryn James called it a \"manic, human, flawed extravaganza ... emerging straight from the excessive tradition of Stanley Elkin's \"The Franchiser\", Thomas Pynchon's \"V.\", [and] John Irving's \"World According to Garp\"\".\nIn 1991, Wallace began teaching literature as an adjunct professor at Emerson College in Boston. The next year, at the suggestion of colleague and supporter Steven Moore, Wallace obtained a position in the English department at Illinois State University. He had begun work on his second novel, \"Infinite Jest\", in 1991, and submitted a draft to his editor in December 1993. After the publication of excerpts throughout 1995, the book was published in 1996.\nIn 1997, Wallace received a MacArthur Fellowship. He also received the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction, awarded by editors of \"The Paris Review\" for one of the stories in \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\", which had been published in the magazine.\nIn 2002, Wallace moved to Claremont, California, to become the first Roy E. Disney endowed Professor of Creative Writing and Professor of English at Pomona College. He taught one or two undergraduate courses per semester and focused on writing.\nWallace delivered the commencement address to the 2005 graduating class at Kenyon College. The speech was published as a book, \"This Is Water\", in 2009. In May 2013, parts of the speech were used in a popular online video, also titled \"This Is Water\".\nBonnie Nadell was Wallace's literary agent during his entire career. Michael Pietsch was his editor on \"Infinite Jest\".\nWallace died in 2008. In March 2009, Little, Brown and Company announced that it would publish the manuscript of an unfinished novel, \"The Pale King\", that Wallace had been working on before his death. Pietsch pieced the novel together from pages and notes Wallace left behind. Several excerpts were published in \"The New Yorker\" and other magazines. \"The Pale King\" was published on April 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews. Michiko Kakutani of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"The Pale King\" \"showcases [Wallace's] embrace of discontinuity; his fascination with both the meta and the microscopic, postmodern pyrotechnics and old-fashioned storytelling; and his ongoing interest in contemporary America's obsession with self-gratification and entertainment.\" The book was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.\nThroughout his career, Wallace published short fiction in periodicals such as \"The New Yorker\", \"GQ\", \"Harper's Magazine\", \"Playboy\", \"The Paris Review\", \"Mid-American Review\", \"Conjunctions\", \"Esquire\", \"Open City\", \"Puerto del Sol\", and \"Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern\".\nThemes and styles.\nWallace wanted to progress beyond the irony and metafiction associated with postmodernism and explore a post-postmodern or metamodern style. In the essay \"E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction\" (written 1990, published 1993), he proposed that television has an ironic influence on fiction, and urged literary authors to eschew TV's shallow rebelliousness: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I want to convince you that irony, poker-faced silence, and fear of ridicule are distinctive of those features of contemporary U.S. culture (of which cutting-edge fiction is a part) that enjoy any significant relation to the television whose weird, pretty hand has my generation by the throat. I'm going to argue that irony and ridicule are entertaining and effective, and that, at the same time, they are agents of a great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that, for aspiring fictionists, they pose terrifically vexing problems.\nWallace used many forms of irony, but tended to focus on individual persons' continued longing for earnest, unself-conscious experience and communication in a media-saturated society.\nWallace's fiction combines narrative modes and authorial voices that incorporate jargon and invented vocabulary, such as self-generated abbreviations and acronyms, long, multi-clause sentences, and an extensive use of explanatory endnotes and footnotes, as in \"Infinite Jest\" and the story \"Octet\" (collected in \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\"), and most of his non-fiction after 1996. In a 1997 interview on \"Charlie Rose\", Wallace said that the notes were to disrupt the linear narrative, to reflect his perception of reality without jumbling the narrative structure, and that he could have jumbled the sentences \"but then no one would read it\". Much of Wallace's writing contains philosophical and mathematical ideas and references.\nD. T. Max has described Wallace's work as an \"unusual mixture of the cerebral and the hot-blooded\", often featuring multiple protagonists and spanning different locations in a single work. His writing comments on the fragmentation of thought, the relationship between happiness and boredom, and the psychological tension between the beauty and hideousness of the human body. According to Wallace, \"fiction's about what it is to be a fucking human being\", and he said he wanted to write \"morally passionate, passionately moral fiction\" that could help the reader \"become less alone inside\". In his Kenyon College commencement address (later published as \"This Is Water\"), Wallace described the human condition as daily crises and chronic disillusionment and warned against succumbing to solipsism, invoking the existential values of compassion and mindfulness:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day.\u00a0... The only thing that's capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're going to try to see it. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn't.\u00a0... The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily consciousness.\nNonfiction.\nWallace covered Senator John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign and the September 11 attacks for \"Rolling Stone\"; cruise ships (in what became the title essay of his first nonfiction book), state fairs, and tornadoes for \"Harper's Magazine\"; the US Open tournament for \"Tennis\" magazine; Roger Federer for \"The New York Times\"; the director David Lynch and the pornography industry for \"Premi\u00e8re\" magazine; the tennis player Michael Joyce for \"Esquire\"; the movie-special-effects industry for \"Waterstone's\" magazine; conservative talk radio host John Ziegler for \"The Atlantic\"; and a Maine lobster festival for \"Gourmet\" magazine. He also reviewed books in several genres for the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The New York Times\", and \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\". In the November 2007 issue of \"The Atlantic\", which commemorated the magazine's 150th anniversary, Wallace was among the authors, artists, politicians and others who wrote short pieces on \"the future of the American idea\".\nThese and other essays appear in three collections, \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again\", \"Consider the Lobster\" and the posthumous \"Both Flesh and Not\", the last of which contains some of Wallace's earliest work, including his first published essay, \"Fictional Futures and the Conspicuously Young\". Wallace's tennis writing was compiled into a volume titled \"String Theory: David Foster Wallace on Tennis\", published in 2016.\nSome writers have found parts of Wallace's nonfiction implausible. Jonathan Franzen has said that he believes Wallace made up dialogue and incidents: \"those things didn't actually happen\". Of the essays \"Shipping Out\" and \"Ticket to the Fair\", John Cook has remarked that in Wallace's nonfiction: Wallace encounters pitch-perfect characters who speak comedically crystalline lines and place him in hilariously absurd situations...I used both stories [when teaching journalism] as examples of the inescapable temptation to shave, embellish, and invent narratives.\nPersonal life.\nWallace struggled with depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, and suicidal ideation, and was repeatedly hospitalized for psychiatric care. In 2008, his father said that Wallace had suffered from major depressive disorder for more than 20 years, and that antidepressant medication had allowed him to be productive. In 1989, Wallace spent four weeks at McLean Hospital, a psychiatric institute in Belmont, Massachusetts, affiliated with Harvard Medical School, where he completed a drug and alcohol detoxification program; he later said his time there changed his life.\nIn the early 1990s, Wallace dated writer Mary Karr. In 2012, Karr described his earlier behavior toward her as obsessive and volatile, alleging that he once threw a coffee table at her and once physically forced her out of a car, leaving her to walk home. In 2018, Karr said that the account of Wallace's alleged abuse in D.T. Max's biography of him was \"about 2% of what happened\"; she claimed that Wallace had kicked her, climbed up the side of her house at night, followed her five-year-old son home from school, and attempted to buy a gun to kill her ex-husband. In 2015, Karr said that Wallace was violent toward other women he dated, and in 2018, she said that several women, including former students of Wallace, contacted her to share their alleged physical and emotional abuse by Wallace.\nIn 2002, Wallace met painter Karen L. Green. They married on December 27, 2004. At the time of Wallace's death, they lived in a house in Claremont, California.\nDogs were important to Wallace, and he spoke of opening a shelter for stray canines. According to his friend Jonathan Franzen, Wallace \"had a predilection for dogs who'd been abused, and [were] unlikely to find other owners who were going to be patient enough for them\".\nIn June 2007, Wallace suffered a physical illness involving severe stomach pains. His doctors believed it was caused by an interaction of one of his medications with food he had eaten at a restaurant. On his doctor's advice, and out of concern that the drug might be interfering with his writing, Wallace stopped taking Nardil (phenelzine), his primary antidepressant. His depression recurred, and he tried other treatments, including electroconvulsive therapy. He eventually went back on phenelzine, but found it ineffective, leaving him with major depressive symptoms.\nDeath.\nOn September 12, 2008, at age 46, Wallace wrote a suicide note to his wife, arranged part of the manuscript for \"The Pale King\", and hanged himself on the back porch of his house. Memorial gatherings were held at Pomona College, Amherst College, the University of Arizona, Illinois State University, and, on October 23, 2008, at New York University (NYU). The eulogists at NYU included his sister, Amy Wallace-Havens; his literary agent, Bonnie Nadell; Gerry Howard, editor of his first two books; Colin Harrison, an editor at \"Harper's Magazine\"; Michael Pietsch, editor of \"Infinite Jest\" and later works; Deborah Treisman, fiction editor at \"The New Yorker\" magazine; and the writers Don DeLillo, Zadie Smith, George Saunders, Mark Costello, Donald Antrim, and Jonathan Franzen.\nLegacy.\nIn March 2010, it was announced that Wallace's personal papers and archives\u2014drafts of books, stories, essays, poems, letters, and research, including the handwritten notes for \"Infinite Jest\"\u2014had been purchased by the University of Texas at Austin. They are held at that university's Harry Ransom Center.\nSince 2011, Loyola University New Orleans has offered English seminar courses on Wallace. Similar courses have also been taught at Harvard University. The first David Foster Wallace Conference was hosted by the Illinois State University Department of English in May 2014; the second was held in May 2015.\nIn January 2017, the International David Foster Wallace Society and the \"Journal of David Foster Wallace Studies\" were launched.\nAmong the writers who have cited Wallace as an influence are Dave Eggers, Jonathan Franzen, Rivka Galchen, Matthew Gallaway, David Gordon, John Green, Porochista Khakpour, George Saunders, Michael Schur, Zadie Smith, Darin Strauss, Deb Olin Unferth, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and Charles Yu.\nAdaptations.\nFilm and television.\nA feature-length film adaptation of \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\", directed by John Krasinski with an ensemble cast, was released in 2009 and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.\nThe 19th episode of the 23rd season of \"The Simpsons\", \"A Totally Fun Thing Bart Will Never Do Again\" (2012), is loosely based on Wallace's essay \"Shipping Out\" from his 1997 collection, \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again\". The Simpson family takes a cruise, and Wallace appears in the background of a scene, wearing a tuxedo T-shirt while eating in the ship's dining room.\nThe 2015 film \"The End of the Tour\" is based on conversations David Lipsky had with Wallace, transcribed in \"Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself\" (2010). Jason Segel played Wallace, and Jesse Eisenberg played Lipsky. The film won an Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Sarasota Film Festival, and Segel was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead.\n\"Partridge\", a Season 5 episode of NBC's \"Parks and Recreation\", repeatedly references \"Infinite Jest\", of which the show's co-creator, Michael Schur, is a noted fan. Schur also directed the music video for The Decemberists' \"Calamity Song\", which depicts the Eschaton game from \"Infinite Jest.\"\nStage and music adaptations.\nTwelve of the interviews from \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\" were adapted as a stage play in 2000 by Dylan McCullough. This was the first theatrical adaptation of Wallace's work. The play, \"Hideous Men\", was also directed by McCullough, and premiered at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2000.\n\"Brief Interviews\" was also adapted by director Marc Caellas as a play, \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Writers\", which premiered at Fundaci\u00f3n Tom\u00e1s Eloy Martinez in Buenos Aires on November 4, 2011. In 2012 it was adapted as a play by artist Andy Holden for a two-night run at the ICA in London.\nThe short story \"Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to Ecko\", from \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\", was adapted by composer Eric Moe into a 50-minute operatic piece, to be performed with accompanying video projections. The piece was described as having \"subversively inscribed classical music into pop culture\".\n\"Infinite Jest\" was performed once as a stage play by Germany's experimental theater Hebbel am Ufer. The play was staged in various locations throughout Berlin, and the action took place over a 24-hour period.\n\"Good Old Neon\", from \"\", was adapted and performed by Ian Forester at the 2011 Hollywood Fringe Festival, produced by the Los Angeles independent theater company Needtheater.\nThe song \"Surrounded by Heads and Bodies\", from the album \"A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships\" by The 1975, borrows its title from the opening line of \"Infinite Jest\". Matty Healy, The 1975's lead singer, said in an interview with \"Pitchfork\" that he was inspired by the novel after reading it during a stint in rehabilitation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was reading [\"Infinite Jest\"] when I was in rehab. There was no one there. It was me and my nurses, who'd come in and check on me, and then Angela [the protagonist of the song], miles away. I was surrounded by no one, and the book was just open on the front page, as most copies of \"Infinite Jest\" are\u00a0... nobody reads [\"Infinite Jest\"] all the way! Everyone our age has got a battered, quarter-read copy of \"Infinite Jest\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It flows from the central Spanish Pyrenees to the Gironde estuary at the French port of Bordeaux \u2013 a length of , of which is in Spain (Val d'Aran); the total length extends to if one includes the Gironde estuary between the river and the sea. Its basin area is , which increases to if the Dordogne River, which flows from the east and joins the Garonne at Bec d'Amb\u00e8s to form the Gironde estuary, is included.\nUmayyad and Aquitanian forces fought the Battle of the River Garonne in 732 beside the river near present-day Bordeaux.\nEtymology.\nThe name derives from \"Garumna\", a Latinized version of the Aquitanian name meaning \"stony river\" (\"kar\" relating to \"stone\" and \"-ona\" relating to \"river\").\nGeography.\nSources.\nThe Garonne's headwaters are to be found in the Aran Valley in the Spanish Pyrenees, though three different locations have been proposed as the true source: the \"Uelh deth Garona\" at Plan de Beret (), the Ratera-Saboredo cirque ), or the slopes of Pic Aneto (Salterillo-Barrancs ravine according to the season).\nThe \"Uelh deth Garona\" at above sea level has been traditionally considered as the source of the Garonne. From this point a brook (called the \"Beret-Garona\") runs for to the bed of the main upper Garonne valley. The river runs for another to the French border at \"Pont de Rei\", in total.\nThe Ratera-Saboredo cirque is the head of the upper Garonne valley, and its upper lake at above sea level is the origin of the Ruda-Garona river, running for to the confluence with the Beret-Garona brook and another to the French border at \"Pont del Rei\", in total. At the confluence, the Ruda-Garona carries of water. The Ratera-Saboredo cirque is considered by many researchers to be the origin of the Garonne.\nThe third theory holds that the river rises on the slopes of Pic Aneto at above sea level and flows by way of a sinkhole known as the \"Forau de Aigualluts\" () through the limestone of the Tuca Blanca de Pom\u00e8ro and a resurgence in the Val dera Artiga above the Aran Valley in the Spanish Pyrenees. This underground route was suggested by the geologist Ramond de Carbonni\u00e8res in 1787 but there was no confirmation until 1931, when caver Norbert Casteret poured fluorescein dye into the flow and noted its emergence a few hours later away at \"Uelhs deth Jo\u00e8u\" (\"Jove's eyes\" ) in the Artiga de Lin on the other side of the mountain. From Aigualluts to the confluence with the main river at the bed of the upper Garonne valley at above sea level, the Jo\u00e8u has run for (16 kilometres more to get to the French border), carrying of water, whilst the main river is carrying .\nDespite the lack of universal agreement on definition for determining a stream's source, the United States Geological Survey, the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution agree that a stream's source should be considered as the most distant point (along watercourses from the river mouth) in the drainage basin from which water runs.\nThe Ratera-Saboredo cirque is the \"most distant point (along watercourses from the river mouth) in the drainage basin from which water runs\" and the source of the Garonne, according to the United States Geological Survey, the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution convention on determining a stream's source.\nCourse.\nThe Garonne follows the Aran Valley northwards into France, flowing via Toulouse and Agen towards Bordeaux, where it meets the Gironde estuary. The Gironde flows into the Atlantic Ocean (Bay of Biscay). Along its course, the Garonne is joined by three other major rivers: the Ari\u00e8ge, the Tarn, and the Lot. Just after Bordeaux, the Garonne meets the Dordogne at the Bec d'Amb\u00e8s, forming the Gironde estuary, which after approximately empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Other tributaries include the Save and the Gers.\nThe Garonne is one of the few rivers in the world that exhibit a tidal bore. Surfers and jet skiers could ride the tidal bore at least as far as the village of Cambes, from the Atlantic, and even further upstream to Cadillac, although the tidal bore appears and disappears in response to changes in the channel bathymetry. In 2010 and 2012, some detailed field studies were conducted in the Garonne's Arcins channel between Arcins Island and the right bank close to Lastrene township. A striking feature of the field data sets was the large and rapid fluctuations in turbulent velocities and turbulent stresses during the tidal bore and flood flow.\nEuropean sea sturgeon conservation.\nThe European sea sturgeon (\"Acipenser sturio\"), also known as the Atlantic sturgeon or common sturgeon, is now a Critically Endangered species (IUCN) status. This species of sturgeon can reach a length of , weigh up to and reach an age of 100 years. Previously found on most coasts of Europe, it has now become so rare that it breeds only in the Garonne river basin in France. Conservation projects are under way to save this fish from extinction via species reintroduction from aquaculture, with the first releases having been made in 1995.\nMain tributaries.\nFollowing the flow of the river, from source to mouth:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNavigation.\nThe Garonne plays an important role in inland shipping. The river not only allows seagoing vessels to reach the port of Bordeaux but also forms part of the Canal des Deux Mers, linking the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\nFrom the ocean, ships pass through the Gironde estuary up to the mouth of the Garonne (to the right of the Dordogne when sailing upstream). Ships continue on the tidal river Garonne up to the \"Pont de Pierre\" (stone bridge) in Bordeaux. Inland vessels continue upstream to Castets-en-Dorthe, where the Canal de Garonne joins the river. Prior to the building of the Canal lateral \u00e0 la Garonne, between 1838 and 1856, shallow-draught boats used the Garonne itself as far as Toulouse. However, navigation on the upper river was very uncertain, and this stretch of the river is no longer considered navigable. Instead the lateral canal takes boats through 53 locks to the town of Toulouse, where the canal meets the Canal du Midi.\nHydrography.\nThe upstream part of the river, upstream from Toulouse depends primarily on snow and snow melt. The lower/downstream part is rain fed as well as its main tributaries.\nThe Garonne also feeds several channels/canals:\nSANDRE assigns to the Garonne a hydrographic identity number 0 --- 00000 and the generic code O --- 000014,15.\nFloods.\nA flood of the Garonne in 1930 broke the dike in Thivras (Marmande).\nIn Toulouse, the Garonne has been the cause of many floods, especially since its left bank is inhabited.\nThe earliest records of floods are from around 1177. It is also recorded to have flooded in 1220, 1258, 1430, 1523, 1536 and in 1589, 1608, 1658, 1673, 1675, 1709, 1712, 1727, 1750, 1772, 1788, 1804 and 1810. In 1772, the Garonne reached 8 meters 50. In the recent centuries, in 1827, 1835, 1855 and 1856/7.\nIn Toulouse, in 1827, the water level of the Garonne rose four meters above the ordinary level and filled the arches of the Pont de Pierre and Pont Neuf.\nIn 1835, the Garonne rose to five meters above normal and 35 meters above the low water level and flowed through the four arcs of the Pont de Pierre.\nFlood of the Garonne in 1835: 7,50 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf\nFlood of the Garonne in 1855: 7.25 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf\nFlood of the Garonne in 1875: 9,70 m to Toulouse Pont-Neuf (or 8m32 according to vigicrue).\nFlood of the Garonne in 1879: 4,87 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf\nFlood of the Garonne in 1890: 3.30 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf\nFlood of the Garonne in 1900: 4,00 m in Toulouse Pont-Neuf\nFlood of the Garonne in 1905: 4.24 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf\nCrete of 1927 in Aquitaine, particularly imposing after the confluence of the Garonne with the Lot (of which it remained raw reference), insignificant upstream18.\nFlood of the Garonne in 1952: 4,57 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf\nFlood of the Garonne in 1977: 4,31 m in Toulouse Pont-Neuf\nFlood of the Garonne in 2000: 4.38 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf\nFlood of the Garonne in 2004: 3,52 m at Toulouse Pont-Neuf\nIn 1777, the Garonne suffered an extraordinary flood to the point that the priest of Bourdelles took the trouble to retranscribe the event, at the end of the acts of the year, in the parish register of baptisms, marriages and deaths.\nFuture water resource management.\nThe \"Garonne 2050\" project, initiated by the Adour-Garonne water agency in 2010, aims to address the future challenges facing the Garonne River basin regarding its water resources. With an anticipated surge of an additional 1\u00a0million inhabitants by 2050, the basin confronts a demographic challenge. The study aims to inform stakeholders and devise an adaptation strategy within the local master plan of water management and development (SDAGE), considering the impact of the predicted demographic shifts.\u00a0Central to the \"Garonne 2050\" study is its examination of the Garonne River basin's agricultural sector. Detailed insights into changes in irrigated agricultural areas, crop rotation, and farm numbers are essential for informing effective water management strategies. Notably, the allocation of water volume to agriculture highlights a delicate balance between sustaining local economic activities and the necessity for agricultural adaptation amid decreasing water availability.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, from the Mediterranean Sea, from the Atlantic Ocean and from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France after Paris, Marseille, and Lyon, with 511,684 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (2022); its metropolitan area has a population of 1,513,396 inhabitants (2022). Toulouse is the central city of one of the 22 metropolitan councils of France. Between the 2014 and 2020 censuses, its metropolitan area was the third fastest growing among metropolitan areas larger than 500,000 inhabitants in France.\nToulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus, the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It hosts the CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST) which is the largest national space centre in Europe, but also, on the military side, the newly created NATO space centre of excellence and the French Space Command and Space Academy. Safran, Thales Alenia Space, Airbus Defence and Space, Collins Aerospace and Liebherr-Aerospace also have a significant presence in Toulouse.\nThe air route between Toulouse\u2013Blagnac and the Parisian airports is the busiest in France, transporting 3.2\u00a0million passengers in 2019. According to the rankings of and \"Challenges\", Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.\nFounded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the administrative region of Occitania, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.\nThe University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229). Toulouse is also the home of prestigious higher education schools, notably in the field of aerospace engineering. Together with the university, they have turned Toulouse into the fourth-largest student city in France, with a university population of nearly 140,000 students.\nToulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname \"\" (\"The Pink city\").\nGeography.\nToulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The city is about 80\u00a0km from the Pyrenees and the borders with Andorra and Spain.\nHydrography.\nThe city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi, the Canal de Garonne and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.\nClimate.\nToulouse has a four-season humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified in the Mediterranean climate zone.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age. The historical name of the city, \"Tolosa\" (\u03a4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the \"Tolosates\", first recorded in the 2nd century BC), is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian or Iberian, but it has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages, or to the same root as Irish \"https://\" or Welsh \"https://\", (little hill).\nToulouse refounded by the Romans on the banks of the Garonne.\nTolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost. After the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city in Gallia Narbonensis. Under the reign of Emperor Augustus and thanks to the Pax Romana, the Romans moved the city a few kilometres from the hills where it was an \"oppidum\" to the banks of the Garonne, which were more suitable for trade.\nIn the second half of the 1st century, the emperor Domitian distinguished Toulouse by placing it under the patronage of the goddess Pallas Athena, so that the Latin poets Martial, Ausonius and Sidonius Apollinaris called the city \"Palladia Tolosa\" (Palladian Toulouse), a term that was still used in the Renaissance and even today when the city is presented as propitious to the arts and letters.\nAround the year 250, Toulouse was marked by the martyrdom of Saturnin, the first bishop of Toulouse. This episode illustrates the difficult beginnings of Christianity in Roman Gaul.\nCapital of the Visigothic Kingdom.\nIn the 5th century, Toulouse fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 during the Battle of Vouill\u00e9. From that time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.\nUnder Frankish rule.\nIn 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).\nThe Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\nCounty of Toulouse.\nCharlemagne had created the county of Toulouse in 778 to guard the border of Muslim Spain, but the disintegration of the kingdom of Aquitaine and the weakness of royal power in the following centuries led to the \"de facto\" independence of the county of Toulouse and many provinces.\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, southern France was still steeped in Latin culture. Unlike the north of France, justice followed written Roman law and the nobles were highly educated. This was the time of the troubadours who wrote their poetry in Occitan (called \"Proven\u00e7al\" at the time), then one of the most sophisticated languages in Europe. Like the other great lords of the Midi, the counts of Toulouse maintained and favoured these poets, this is how Count Raymond V employed for some time the famous Bernard de Ventadour, expert in singing courtly love.\nIn 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope Urban II to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders. This exodus of its warriors and nobles, reinforced by the creation of the faraway County of Tripoli by Raymond IV at the beginning of the 12th century, weakened the city militarily as well as the ascendancy that its counts had over it. The Duke William IX of Aquitaine challenged the possession of the city on the grounds that it should have been inherited by his wife Philippa (daughter of the previous count of Toulouse, whereas Raymond IV was only his brother). More than 50 years later his granddaughter Eleanor of Aquitaine still claimed the inheritance in vain.\nIn the 12th century the city left its Roman limits and a new district developed around the church of Saint-Sernin: the \"Bourg\". The church of Saint-Sernin was famous and revered for its many relics, and the chapter of its canons, which had possessions as far away as Spain, was powerful enough to free itself from the control of the bishop of Toulouse. This dissent had important local political repercussions, making the \"Bourg\" in practice a separate district from the city. In 1152, the notables of Toulouse took advantage of a weakening of the county power to obtain for their city a great autonomy, they created a municipal body of consuls, called capitouls in Toulouse, to lead the city. The \"Bourg\", which had only a quarter of the inhabitants of Toulouse, obtained as many capitouls as the rest of the city. Economically, Toulouse, which was at the center of a large cereal-growing plain, was distinguished by its numerous mills that took advantage of the force of the Garonne, among which the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company.\nThe fight against Catharism and its various aspects.\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the County of Toulouse was caught up in another crusade that would last twenty years (1209-1229), of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope Innocent III wanted to eradicate by all possible means.\nAfter an initial victory of the crusaders led by Simon de Montfort who defeated the combined forces of Count Raymond VI of Toulouse and King Peter II of Aragon at the Battle of Muret, the following years saw the fate of the county of Toulouse swing alternately in favour of one party or the other. Finally, a late intervention by King Louis VIII of France in 1226 tipped the balance in favour of the crusaders, resulting in the submission of Count Raymond VII to the French Crown and the end of the independence of the County of Toulouse.\nBut beyond the military crusade, this struggle took on several important aspects for the city of Toulouse:\nKingdom of France.\nIn 1271, Joan of Toulouse and her husband Alphonse of Poitiers died without heirs. Toulouse, which since the treaty of 1229 had been subordinate to the kingdom of France, no longer had a count and was annexed to the royal domain. The installation of numerous royal officers and the development of trade and crafts, which favoured the social ascension of merchants, renewed the city's elites. In 1298, King Philip the Fair greatly facilitated the possibility of ennobling the capitouls, whose council, renewed every year, was increasingly made up of rich merchants.\nThe first half of the 14th century was a prosperous period, despite the dismemberment in 1317 of the very large bishopric of Toulouse (which lost two thirds of its area and a large part of its income, a loss only partially compensated by its elevation to the rank of archbishopric), and the episode of the Shepherds' Crusade which brought a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population in 1320. In 1335, Toulouse had between 35,000 and 40,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1323, the \"Consistori del Gay Saber\" was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the following centuries. The \"Consistori\" is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of one of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (\"Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux\"), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\nThe 14th century also saw a significant increase in the influence of the University of Toulouse, particularly following the move of the papacy from Rome to Avignon. Many law graduates from the University of Toulouse had brilliant careers in the Avignon curia, several became cardinals and three became popes: John XXII, Innocent VI and Urban V. These powerful prelates financed the establishment of colleges in the university towns of southern France, not only Toulouse but also Montpellier, Cahors and Avignon.\nThe Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years' War caused a major crisis that lasted until the following century. Despite strong immigration, the population lost more than 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people. In these hardships, the city was the key stronghold of the French defence in the south of France during the worst years of the Hundred Years' War, when the English troops from Aquitaine had taken Montauban and only Toulouse remained as an obstacle to their conquest of southern France. This military threat to the city and especially to the surrounding countryside was not conducive to its development, despite the strengthening of ties with the royalty that it entailed.\nIn 1369, pope Urban V attributed to the Dominican church of the Jacobins of Toulouse the bones of the Dominican theologian Saint Thomas Aquinas, perhaps to honor the city that had been the cradle of the Dominican order at the beginning of the previous century.\nThe political and economic situation improved by the middle of the 15th century. In 1443 King Charles VII established the second parlement of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative and judicial center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of \"pastel\", a blue dye made from woad.\nToulouse suffered several fires, but it was in 1463 that the Great Fire of Toulouse broke out, ravaging the city for fifteen days. After this dramatic event, King Louis XIII exempted the city from taxes for 100 years. The capitouls issued municipal decrees favouring the use of brick in buildings, rather than excessively flammable wood or cob.\nIn the 16th century, and until 1562, the economy of Toulouse experienced a golden age: its parlement made it the judicial capital of a large part of southern France, and the city became the first European centre for the trade in woad, the only blue dye then known in Europe which was very much in demand in the textile industry at the time. Its humanist milieu developed thanks to its university and parlement, which trained and attracted intellectual elites. The wealth generated by this culturally and economically dynamic environment is the source of the superb Renaissance mansions in Toulouse. In 1550 the population of the city made it the second or third largest city in France. It was estimated to have 50,000 inhabitants, a figure it would not regain until the 18th century.\nIn 1562, the French Wars of Religion began and Toulouse became an ultra-Catholic stronghold in a predominantly Huguenot region, the era of economic prosperity came to an end. The governor of Languedoc, Henri II de Montmorency, who had rebelled, was executed in 1632 in the Capitole in the presence of King Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu.\nIn 1666, Pierre-Paul Riquet started the construction of the Canal du Midi which links Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea, and is considered one of the greatest construction works of the 17th century. Completed in 1681, the canal stimulated the economy of Toulouse by promoting the export of cereals and the import of olive oil, wine and other goods from the Mediterranean regions.\nIn the 18th century, Toulouse was a provincial capital that prided itself on its royal academies (the only city in France, along with Paris, to have three royal academies), but sometimes seemed far removed from the debates of ideas that agitated the Enlightenment. A famous example illustrates this backwardness of Toulouse mentalities of the time: in 1762 its powerful parlement sentenced Jean Calas to death. The philosopher Voltaire then accused the Parlement of Toulouse of religious intolerance (Calas was a Huguenot), gave the affair a European repercussion and succeeded in having the judgment of the parlement quashed by the King's Council, which did much damage to the reputation of the parlement. It was on this occasion that Voltaire published one of his major philosophical works: his famous \"Treatise on Tolerance\".\nWith the French Revolution of 1789 and the reform or suppression of all royal institutions, Toulouse lost much of its power and influence: until then the capital of the vast province of Languedoc, with a parlement ruling over an even larger territory, the city then found itself simply at the head of the single small department of Haute-Garonne.\n19th century.\nOn 10 April 1814, four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition (a fact that the two armies involved were not yet aware of), the Battle of Toulouse pitted the Hispanic-British troops of Field Marshal Wellington against the French troops of Napoleonic Marshal Soult, who, although they managed to resist, were forced to withdraw. Toulouse was thus the scene of the last Franco-British battle on French territory.\nUnlike most large French cities, there was no real industrial revolution in 19th century Toulouse. The most important industries were the gunpowder factory, to meet military needs, and the tobacco factory. In 1856 the railway arrived in Toulouse and the city was modernised: the ramparts were replaced by large boulevards, and major avenues such as the \"rue d'Alsace-Lorraine\" and the \"rue de Metz\" opened up the historic centre.\nIn 1875, a flood of the Garonne devastated more than 1,000 houses and killed 200 people. It also destroyed all the bridges in Toulouse, except the Pont-Neuf.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nWorld War I brought to Toulouse (geographically sheltered from enemy attacks) chemical industries as well as aviation workshops (Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re, Dewoitine), which launched the city's aeronautical construction tradition and gave birth after the war to the famous \"A\u00e9ropostale\", a pioneering airmail company based in Toulouse and whose epics were popularised by the novels of writers such as Joseph Kessel and Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (himself an \"A\u00e9ropostale\" pilot).\nIn the 1920s and 1930s the rise of the Toulouse population was increased by the arrival of Italians and Spaniards fleeing the fascist regimes of their country. Then, in the early 1960s, French repatriates from Algeria swelled the city's population.\nIn 1963, Toulouse was chosen to become one of the country's eight \"balancing Metropolis\", regaining a position among the country's major cities that it had always had, but lost in the 19th century. The French state then encouraged the city's specialisation in aeronautics and space activities, sectors that had experienced strong growth in recent decades, fueling economic and population growth.\nOn 21 September 2001, an explosion occurred at the AZF fertiliser factory, causing 31 deaths, about 30 seriously wounded and 2,500 light casualties. The blast measured 3.4 on the Richter scale and the explosion was heard away.\nIn 2016, a territorial reform made Toulouse the regional prefecture of Occitanie, the second largest region in metropolitan France, giving it a role commensurate with its past as a provincial capital among the most important in France.\nPopulation.\nThe population of the city proper (French: \"commune\") was 511,684 as of January 2022, with 1,513,396 inhabitants in the metropolitan area, up from 1,268,438 at the January 2009 census. Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.63% per year between 2009 and 2021, the third-highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants in France, after Montpellier and Bordeaux, although it was slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1990 and 2009 censuses. Toulouse is the fourth most populated city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fifth most populated metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Lille. During the next census 2023 or 2024, the city of Toulouse should become the 3rd most populous city in France ahead of Lyon because its growth is stronger.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, the Toulouse metropolitan area's population grew by 57.3% between the 1990 and 2020 censuses (within its 2020 borders), which means +1.52% per year on average during those 30 years, compared with a growth of 15.3% for metropolitan France between 1990 and 2020, i.e. +0.48% per year. This was the second-highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants (only the Montpellier metropolitan area grew more than Toulouse between 1990 and 2019).\nThe Toulouse metropolitan area reached 1,513,396 inhabitants in January 2022, and stood as the 5th most populated metropolitan area in France, behind the metropolitan areas of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Lille, but ahead of the metropolitan area of Bordeaux, which the Toulouse metropolitan area passed in population in the 1990s. During the next census 2023, the metropolitan area of Toulouse will become the 4th most populous in France ahead of Lille because its growth is stronger.\nA local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.\nGovernment and politics.\nToulouse M\u00e9tropole.\nThe Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (\"Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Toulouse\") was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent \"communes\", covering an area of , totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communaut\u00e9 urbaine). This has become a m\u00e9tropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes with 806,503 inhabitants in 2020 census.\nLocal politics.\nOne of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist known for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (\"Halle aux Grains\") was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (\"Z\u00e9nith\", the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park \"Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace\" was founded, etc.\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.\nIn 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (\"Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel\") in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen.\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes, and he was re-elected with almost the same score in 2020.\nSights and architecture.\nClassified \"City of Art and History\", Toulouse has a very rich architectural heritage ranging from large Romanesque and Gothic churches to neo-classical facades such as that of the Capitole, to the prestigious mansions of the Renaissance. This ancient heritage is mainly enclosed within the 220 hectares of the city's inner boulevard (one of the largest protected urban areas in France).\nAlmost all the buildings of the historical centre were made with the traditional building material of the region: the \"foraine\" brick that has earned the city the nickname of \"Ville rose\" (Pink city). Medieval heir to the Roman brick, the \"foraine\" brick is characterised by its large dimensions, its flat appearance and its colour ranging from orange/pink to red.\nWhite stone is also present in smaller quantities. As there were no stone quarries near Toulouse, it was transported from the Pyrenees via the Garonne river and was for a long time rare and therefore expensive, considered in Toulouse as a luxury material. However, it is enough to give Toulouse's architecture one of its characteristics: red/white polychromy.\nRomanesque architecture (11th-12th c.).\nThe Romanesque architecture of Toulouse is largely dominated by the presence of the Basilica of Saint-Sernin, one of the most important churches of its time in Europe, and fortunate enough to keep its Romanesque character virtually intact.\nBasilica of Saint-Sernin.\nBasilica of Saint-Sernin, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, was also in itself a major place of pilgrimage. It is one of the two largest surviving Romanesque churches in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including that of Saint Saturnin who gave his name to the church), many of which were donated by Charlemagne to the shrine that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin is the church with the most relics after Saint Peter of Rome.\nConceived from the outset as a gigantic reliquary, the church was mainly built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir. The church is also particularly noteworthy for the quality of its Romanesque sculptures, including numerous capitals and the historiated tympanum of the Mi\u00e8geville gate, one of the first of its kind.\nGothic architecture (13th c.-early 16th c.).\nSouthern French Gothic: a militant religious architecture.\nAt the beginning of the 13th century, the Catholic clergy of the South of France, seeing a growing number of the faithful turning to the Catharism which advocated a more pious austerity, showed the will to correct the defects of the Catholic Church which indulged in luxury. Under the impulse of the bishop of Toulouse, Foulques, an austere and militant architectural style was born with the reconstruction of the Cathedral of Toulouse: the Southern French Gothic. Conceived according to an ideal of poverty and humility to bring the faithful together in a single, vast nave to facilitate preaching, this architectural style then developed during the 13th century in the grand mendicant convents of the city, before spreading in the 14th century to a large number of churches and cathedrals in the region.\nSeveral churches or convents in Toulouse belong to this architectural trend, but two of them are particularly symbolic and remarkable:\nGothic civil architecture.\nToulouse has preserved about thirty Gothic stair towers (plus a dozen Renaissance or later towers), the remains of private mansions (called \"h\u00f4tels particuliers\") from the Middle Ages and the early 16th century. Often hidden in courtyards, some of these towers are high enough to exceed their function of serving the floors and display the ambition of their owners.\nAt a time when most of the houses in Toulouse were built in wood or cob, the brick construction of these towers and \"h\u00f4tels\" also testifies to their quality.\nRenaissance architecture (16th c.-early 17th c.).\nIn the 16th century, Toulouse experienced a golden age coinciding with the Renaissance in France. The woad trade (\"pastel\") brought merchants of international stature to the city, and the Parlement of Toulouse made the city the judicial capital of a large part of the south of France. These wealthy elites had private mansions built, remarkable for their architecture inspired by architectural treatises such as those of Serlio, Alberti or Vitruvius, but also by the royal castles of the Loire Valley and the \u00cele-de-France.\nRenowned for the quality of their architecture, the private mansions of the Toulouse Renaissance that have survived to the present day were built over more than a century (around 1515\u20131620) by reputed architects such as Louis Privat, Nicolas Bachelier, Dominique Bachelier or Pierre Souffron. The most famous of these \"h\u00f4tels\" are those of Ass\u00e9zat, Bernuy, Vieux-Raisin or Clary...\n17th century architecture.\n17th century religious architecture.\nThe French Wars of Religion, which started in the second half of the 16th century, brought to the city many religious orders who came to seek asylum in this solid Catholic bastion. They had baroque churches built in the 17th century: among them, the Order of Carthusians, expelled by the Huguenots from the region of Castres, founded the church of Saint-Pierre des Chartreux, the order of the Discalced Carmelites built the church of Saint-Exup\u00e8re, the blue penitents founded the church of Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me and the order of Carmelite nuns created a convent of which a remarkable painted chapel remains.\n17th century civil architecture.\nAfter the Renaissance, the decorations in civil architecture became less numerous and ostentatious, due to the importance given to the moderation of the architectural structures and the development of interior decorations. The play of colours (between brick and stone) and reliefs (bossing) were less costly and nevertheless effective solutions for livening up facades. The 17th century is the century that gave Toulouse the largest number of its private mansions, most of them built by members of parlement.\n18th century architecture.\nIn the 18th century Toulouse made its living from its parlement and from the wheat and corn trade, which was boosted by the creation of the Canal du Midi at the end of the previous century. Among the major architectural achievements, the most notable were undoubtedly the construction of the quays of the Garonne and the new facade of the Capitole (1750-1760), designed by architect Guillaume Cammas.\nIn the last third of the 18th century, the ever increasing influence of the Parisian model meant that red brick was no longer popular: the city facades were then whitewashed to imitate stone. This is why nowadays, even though the white paint has generally been removed, there are walls with deep grooves carved in brick to imitate ashlar architecture.\n19th century architecture.\nToulouse's 19th century architecture can be divided into three periods, which sometimes overlapped. In the first half of the century, at the instigation of architect Jacques-Pascal Virebent, the main architecturally unified squares were created: the \"Place du Capitole\" and the \"Place Wilson\" (called \"place Villeneuve\" when it was built), whose uniform architecture was inspired by Rue de Rivoli in Paris.\nFrom 1830 onwards, Auguste Virebent and his brothers (sons of Jacques-Pascal) developed a factory of low-cost moulded decorations which met with great success and adorned Toulouse facades with numerous terracotta ornaments, far from the austere architecture of their father.\nThen, in the last third of the 19th century, large Haussmann-style avenues were opened in the town centre, such as the central Alsace-Lorraine street, built in yellow brick to imitate Parisian stone.\n20th and 21st centuries architecture.\nFrom the middle of the 19th century, the arrival of the railway in Toulouse facilitated the supply of stone and made it cheaper for construction, and architects did not hesitate to play on the old traditional Toulouse codes linked to the prestige of stone construction, even if these no longer had the economic justification of yesteryear. Thus, at the beginning of the 20th century, the main railway station was built entirely in white stone.\nSubsequently, concrete replaced the traditional materials, but brick and stone were still used for cladding, as shown recently by the work of prestigious architects such as Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown for the seat of the departmental council, or Shelley McNamara and Yvonne Farrell for the Toulouse School of Economics building.\nBanks of the Garonne, Canal du Midi, parks.\nThe banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which was subject to destructive floods. The Pont-Neuf took almost a century to build as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). It was a very modern bridge for its time, removing the housing on the deck and using techniques such as lowered arches, openings in the piers and stacked spouts to spread the water, making it the only bridge in Toulouse to withstand the violent floods of the past. Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the H\u00f4pital de La Grave. Isolated on the left bank, victims of the plague and other sick people were thus kept away from the city by the width of the river.\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe \"Jardin des Plantes\", the \"Grand Rond\" and the \"Jardin Royal\" form a set of adjacent parks that span several blocks and include the Museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, children's activities and a botanical garden (18th-19th century). The \"Prairie des Filtres\", the Raymond VI garden and the Japanese garden are other interesting parks that border the center of Toulouse.\nMuseums and theme parks.\nToulouse has many museums, the most important of which are:\nToulouse also has several theme parks, notably highlighting its aeronautical and space heritage:\nEconomy.\nSince 2003, Toulouse has been the French city with the fastest growing GDP per capita, a performance driven by growing high-tech industries.\nToulouse economy can rely on three pillars: large industrial companies, research laboratories and a huge pool of students, engineers and scientists. Indeed, Toulouse is home to the second largest research and education centre in France, it has a high quality of education, first class engineering schools, powerful industries supported by world leaders, such as Airbus or Thales Alenia for aeronautics and space. This ecosystem fosters innovation in fields such as artificial intelligence, IOT, robotics, avionics, embedded systems, biotechnology, health etc.\nToulouse can particularly be described as the 'capital' of the European aerospace industry: it hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320, A330, and A350. The A380 was also produced here (the last completed in 2021), as was the Concorde supersonic aircraft. Toulouse also hosts the headquarters of ATR, one of the two headquarters of Liebherr Aerospace and Groupe Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re. As for the space industry, with 12,000 jobs, 400 companies and 25% of the European workforce, Toulouse is the main European hub.\nEducation.\nToulouse has the fourth-largest student population in France after Paris, Lyon and Lille with 103,000 students (2012).\nColleges and universities.\nThe University of Toulouse (\"Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse\") was established in 1229 (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology\u2014inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts\u2014as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.\nToulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nThe most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Sernin.\nInternational schools serving area expatriates are in nearby Colomiers:\nTransport.\nTrain.\nThe main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau station. In addition, there are several smaller stations in the city: Toulouse-Saint-Agne, Gallieni-Canc\u00e9rop\u00f4le, Toulouse-Saint-Cyprien-Ar\u00e8nes, Le TOEC, Lardenne, Saint-Martin-du-Touch, Les Ramassiers, Montaudran and Lacourtensourt. The stations of Lalande-L'Eglise and Route-de-Launaguet were served until 2016.\nMetro.\nAll urban bus, metro and tram services are operated by Tiss\u00e9o. In addition to an extensive bus system (145 lines), the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tyred trains:\nLine C is under construction for an opening in 2028 with 21 stations over 27\u00a0km. It will cross line B at 2 stations (La Vache and Fran\u00e7ois Verdier) and will cross line A at Matabiau Gares (central train station)\nActual Line C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Ar\u00e8nes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named \"Gare des Capelles\", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened. Le TOEC station opened on 1 September 2003 with the creation of line C, allowing an urban train service in Toulouse and close western suburbs. Since 2023, the service is now named \"Ar\u00e8nes-Colomiers\" train line to leave the name for the new metro line.\nSimilarly, Line D runs south from Toulouse Matabiau to Muret.\nTramway.\nThe Toulouse conurbation has two tram lines:\nCable car.\nSince 13 May 2022, the city of Toulouse has had a new mode of public transportation called T\u00e9l\u00e9o. This is a cable car that links Paul-Sabatier University to Rangueil Hospital and the Oncopole (a major cancer research centre). It allows to fly over the Garonne and the hill of Pech David and, with its 3 kilometres, it is the longest urban cable car in France. It is presented as the first link in a public transport belt that is not radial and oriented towards the city centre, but designed to encircle the south of Toulouse.\nBicycle.\nIn 2007, a citywide bicycle rental scheme called V\u00e9l\u00f4Toulouse was introduced, with bicycles available from automated stations for a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly subscription.\nAirports.\nAirports include:\nCanal.\nThe Canal du Midi begins in Toulouse and runs up to S\u00e8te.\nToulouse public transportation statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Toulouse on a weekday is 44 minutes. 9.1% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 9 minutes, while 10.4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 8% travel for over in a single direction.\nCommunications.\nToulouse is the home of Bonhoure Radio Tower, a lattice tower used for FM and TV transmission. In 2001 a optical fiber (symmetric 360\u00a0Gbit/s) network named \"Infrastructure M\u00e9tropolitaine de T\u00e9l\u00e9communications\" was deployed around the city and suburbs.\nCulture.\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole is the home of opera and ballet; there has been a theatre on the site since 1736. The Orchestre National du Capitole, long associated with Michel Plasson, plays at the Halle aux Grains. On 31 October 2023, Toulouse was named UNESCO City of Music.\nLe Ch\u00e2teau d'Eau, an old 19th-century water-tower, was converted as a gallery in 1974 by Jean Dieuzaide, a French photographer from Toulouse and is now one of the oldest public places dedicated to photography in the world. Toulouse's art museums include the Mus\u00e9e des Augustins, the Mus\u00e9e des Abattoirs, the Mus\u00e9e Georges Labit, and the Fondation Bemberg in the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat. The Mus\u00e9e Saint-Raymond is devoted to Antiquity and the Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse to natural history.\nToulouse is the seat of the Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux, the equivalent of the French Academy for the Occitan-speaking regions of southern France, making Toulouse the unofficial capital of Occitan culture. The traditional Cross of Toulouse (from Provence, under the name of cross of Provence), emblem of the County of Toulouse and commonly widespread around all of Occitania during the Middle Ages is the symbol of the city and of the newly founded Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es \"r\u00e9gion\", as well as a popular Occitan symbol.\nThe city's gastronomic specialties include the Saucisse de Toulouse, a type of sausage, \"cassoulet\" Toulousain, a bean and pork stew, and \"garbure\", a cabbage soup with poultry. Also, foie gras, the liver of an overfed duck or goose, is a delicacy commonly made in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.\nSport.\nStade Toulousain of the Top 14 is the most successful rugby union clubs in Europe, having been crowned European champions six times and French champions twenty-four times.\nToulouse Olympique represents the city in rugby league. The club has been playing in the British rugby league system since 2016. They have been playing in the top tier in 2022 and played in the 2nd tier Championship in 2023, after their relegation. The club has had historical success in France, having been crowned French champions six times.\nThe city also has a professional football team, Toulouse FC, which plays in Ligue 1, the highest level of football in France. The Toulouse FC won the Coupe de France in 2023, winning against FC Nantes the 2023 final. The club plays at the Stadium Municipal, which was a venue during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as hosting important club rugby games and several Rugby League World Cups. Toulouse was also a host of EuroBasket 1999.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotable people.\nSeveral notable Toulousains have been scientists, such as Jean Dausset (1916\u20132009), 1980 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; 17th-century mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1607\u20131665), who spent his life in Toulouse, where he wrote Fermat's Last Theorem and was a lawyer in the city's parlement; Paul Sabatier (1854\u20131941), 1912 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry; Albert Fert (b. 1938), 2007 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics who grew up in Toulouse where he attended the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Jean Tirole (b. 1953), owner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, chairman and founder of the Toulouse School of Economics along with Jean-Jacques Laffont.\nMusically, Toulouse is one of the two controversial, disputed birthplaces of Carlos Gardel (1890\u20131935) (the other being Tacuarembo, Uruguay), probably the most prominent figure in the history of the tango. The city's most renowned songwriter is Claude Nougaro (1929-2004). The composer and organist Georges Guiraud (1868\u20131928) and songwriter Jain (b. 1992) were born in Toulouse.\nConcerning arts, Toulouse is the birthplace of Impressionist painter Henri Martin (1860\u20131943) as well as sculptors Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re (1831\u20131900), Antonin Merci\u00e9 (1845\u20131916) and illustrator Edmund Dulac (1882\u20131953). Moreover, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780\u20131867) and Antoine Bourdelle (1861\u20131929) were trained at the Toulouse fine arts school.

{"id": "45372", "revid": "698799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45372", "title": "King Oliver", "text": "American jazz cornet player and bandleader (1881\u20131938)\nJoseph Nathan \"King\" Oliver (December 19, 1881 \u2013 c. April 10, 1938) was an American jazz cornet player and bandleader. He was particularly recognized for his playing style and his pioneering use of mutes in jazz. Also a notable composer, he wrote many tunes still played today, including \"Dippermouth Blues\", \"Sweet Like This\", \"Canal Street Blues\", and \"Doctor Jazz\". He was the mentor and teacher of Louis Armstrong. His influence was such that Armstrong claimed, \"if it had not been for Joe Oliver, jazz would not be what it is today.\"\nBiography.\nLife.\nJoseph Nathan Oliver was born in Aben, Louisiana, near Donaldsonville in Ascension Parish, to \nNathan Oliver and Virginia \"Jinnie\" Jones. He claimed 1881 as his year of birth in his draft registration in September 1918 (two months before the end of World War I) but that year is open to debate, with some census records and other sources suggesting 1884 or 1885 as his true year of birth.\nHe moved to New Orleans in his youth. He first studied the trombone, then changed to cornet. From 1908 to 1917, he played cornet in New Orleans brass bands and dance bands and in the city's red-light district, which came to be known as Storyville. A band he co-led with trombonist Kid Ory was considered one of the best and hottest in New Orleans in the late 1910s. He was popular in New Orleans across economic and racial lines and was in demand for music jobs of all kinds.\nAccording to an oral history interview at Tulane University's Hogan Jazz Archive with Oliver's widow, Stella, a fight broke out at a dance where Oliver was playing, and the police arrested him, his band, and the fighters.\nHe was living in Chicago with his wife, Estelle \"Stella\" Dominick, whom he had married in New Orleans in September 1911. He continued to work at the Dreamland, forming a band there in January 1920, which included Johnny Dodds, Honor\u00e9 Dutrey, and Lil Hardin, the nucleus of his famous Creole Jazz Band. After Storyville closed, he moved to Chicago in 1918 with his wife and step-daughter, Ruby Tuesday Oliver (born 1905).\nNoticeably different in his approach were faster tempos, unlike the slow drags in the African-American dance halls of New Orleans. In Chicago, he found work with colleagues from New Orleans, such as clarinetist Lawrence Duh\u00e9, bassist Bill Johnson, trombonist Roy Palmer, and drummer Paul Barbarin. He became leader of Duh\u00e9's band, playing at a number of Chicago clubs. In the summer of 1921, he took a group to the West Coast, playing engagements in San Francisco and Oakland, California. On the west coast, Oliver and his band engaged with the vaudeville tradition, performing in plantation outfits.\nOliver and his band returned to Chicago in 1922, where they started playing in the Lincoln Gardens as King Oliver and his Creole Jazz Band. In addition to Oliver on cornet, the personnel included his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Louis Armstrong on second cornet, Baby Dodds on drums, Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Lil Hardin (later Armstrong's wife) on piano, Honor\u00e9 Dutrey on trombone, and Bill Johnson on double bass. Recordings made by this group in 1923 for Gennett, Okeh, Paramount, and Columbia demonstrated the New Orleans style of collective improvisation, also known as Dixieland, and brought it to a larger audience. Because they were recording acousticly into a horn that was directly connected to the needle making the record master, Armstrong notably had to stand in the corner of the room, away from the horn, because his powerful playing bounced the needle off the master. In addition, white musicians would visit Lincoln Gardens in order to learn from Oliver and his band. Because Lincoln Gardens was in Chicago's black neighborhood and only admitted blacks, the white players listened outside near the front door. A prospective tour in the midwestern states ultimately broke up the band in 1924.\nIn the mid-1920s Oliver enlarged his band to nine musicians, performing under the name King Oliver and his Dixie Syncopators, and began using more written arrangements with jazz solos. This band led by Oliver at the Plantation Caf\u00e9 was in direct competition with Louis Armstrong's Sunset Stompers, who performed at the Sunset Caf\u00e9. In 1927 the band went to New York, but he disbanded it to do freelance jobs. In the later 1920s, he struggled with playing trumpet due to his gum disease, so he employed others to handle the solos, including his nephew Dave Nelson, Louis Metcalf, and Red Allen. He reunited the band in 1928, recording for Victor Talking Machine Company one year later. He continued with modest success until a downturn in the economy made it more difficult to find bookings. His periodontitis made playing the trumpet progressively difficult. He quit playing music in 1937.\nWork and influence.\nAs a player, Oliver took great interest in altering his horn's sound. He pioneered the use of mutes, including the rubber plumber's plunger, derby hat, bottles and cups. His favorite mute was a small metal mute made by the C.G. Conn Instrument Company, with which he played his famous solo on his composition the \"Dippermouth Blues\" (an early nickname for fellow cornetist Louis Armstrong). His recording \"Wa Wa Wa\" with the Dixie Syncopators can be credited with giving the name wah-wah to such techniques. This \"freak\" style of trumpet playing was also featured in his composition, \"Eccentric.\" One of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Louis Panico (cornetist with the Isham Jones Orchestra), authored a book entitled \"The Novelty Cornetist\", which is illustrated with photos showing some of the mute techniques he learned from Oliver.\nOliver was also a talented composer, and wrote many tunes that are still regularly played, including \"Dippermouth Blues,\" \"Sweet Like This,\" \"Canal Street Blues,\" and \"Doctor Jazz.\" \"Dippermouth Blues,\" for example, was adapted by Don Redman for Fletcher Henderson's Orchestra under the new name of \"Sugar Foot Stomp\".\nOliver performed mostly on cornet, but like many cornetists he switched to trumpet in the late 1920s. He credited jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden as an early influence, and in turn was a major influence on numerous younger cornet/trumpet players in New Orleans and Chicago, including Tommy Ladnier, Paul Mares, Muggsy Spanier, Johnny Wiggs, Frank Guarente and, the most famous of all, Armstrong. \nAs mentor to Armstrong in New Orleans, Oliver taught young Louis and gave him his job in Kid Ory's band when he went to Chicago. A few years later Oliver summoned him to Chicago to play with his band. Louis remembered Oliver as \"Papa Joe\" and considered him his idol and inspiration. In his autobiography, \"Satchmo: My Life in New Orleans\", Armstrong wrote: \"It was my ambition to play as he did. I still think that if it had not been for Joe Oliver, Jazz would not be what it is today. He was a creator in his own right.\"\nHardships in later years, decline and death.\nOliver's business acumen could not equal his musical skill. A succession of managers stole money from him, and he tried to negotiate more money for his band than the Savoy Ballroom was willing to pay \u2013 losing the job. He lost the chance of an important engagement at New York City's famous Cotton Club when he held out for more money; young Duke Ellington took the job and subsequently catapulted to fame.\nThe Great Depression brought hardship to Oliver. He lost his life savings to a collapsed bank in Chicago, and he struggled to keep his band together through a series of hand-to-mouth gigs until the group broke up.\nOliver also had health problems, such as pyorrhea, a gum disease that was partly caused by his love of sugar sandwiches and it made it very difficult for him to play and he soon began delegating solos to younger players, but by 1935, he could no longer play the trumpet at all. Oliver was stranded in Savannah, Georgia, where he pawned his trumpet and finest suits and briefly ran a fruit stall, then he worked as a janitor at Wimberly's Recreation Hall (526\u2013528 West Broad Street).\nOliver died in poverty \"of arteriosclerosis, too broke to afford treatment\" in a Savannah rooming house around April 1938. His sister spent her rent money to have his body brought to New York, where he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx. Armstrong and other loyal musician friends were in attendance.\nHonors and awards.\nOliver was inducted as a charter member of the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in Richmond, Indiana in 2007.\nDiscography.\nNOTE: The Joe King Oliver recording legacy is also available in the four volumes of \"The Chronological\" serie (1923-31) Classics. I've chosen the above editions for the alternate takes, some minor items, and especially a better audio restoration and remastering.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45376", "revid": "16055414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45376", "title": "Baccarat", "text": "Gambling card game\nBaccarat or baccara (; ) is a card game. It is now mainly played at casinos, but was also formerly popular at house parties and private gaming rooms. The game's origins are a mixture of precursors from China, Japan, and Korea, which then gained popularity in Europe with a faster French rendition following, and today the most common version played derives from Cuba. \nIt is a comparing card game played between two hands, the \"player\" and the \"banker\". Each baccarat coup (round of play) has three possible outcomes: \"player\" (player has the higher score), \"banker\", and \"tie\".\nThere are three popular variants of the game: \"punto banco\", \"baccarat chemin de fer\", and \"baccarat banque\" (or \"\u00e0 deux tableaux\"). In \"punto banco\", each player's moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt. In \"baccarat chemin de fer\" and \"baccarat banque\", by contrast, both players can make choices. The winning odds are in favour of the bank, with a house edge of at least 1 percent.\nHistory.\nThe origins of the game are disputed. Some sources claim that it dates to the 19th century, others that the game was introduced into France from Italy at the end of the 15th century by soldiers returning from the Italian Wars during the reign of King of France Charles VIII.\nDavid Parlett considers Macao the immediate precursor to baccarat. Its name and rules suggest it may have been brought over by sailors returning from Asia where similar card games have been played since the early 17th century such as San zhang, Oicho-Kabu, and Gabo japgi. Macao appeared in Europe at the end of the 18th century and was popular for all classes. Its notoriety led to King Victor-Amadeus III banning it in all his realms in 1788. It was the most popular game in Watier's, an exclusive gentlemen's club in London, where it led to the ruin of Beau Brummell. It was declared illegal late in the 19th century, as a gambling game of almost pure chance; however it remained wildly popular in high society, aficionados including the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII), who was compelled to testify in court following the Royal baccarat scandal of 1890, in which a player was accused of cheating during games held at Tranby Croft in Yorkshire, England. The match in Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella \"Night Games\" (\"Spiel im Morgengrauen\") contains instructions for Macao under the name of \"baccarat\". Its popularity in the United States waned after the early 20th century. The game still has a following in Continental Europe, especially in Russia. Like Macao and Victoria, baccarat was banned in Russia during the 19th century though the rules continued to be printed in game books.\nBaccarat has been popular among the French nobility since the 19th century.230 Before the legalization of casino gambling in 1907, people in France commonly played baccarat in private gaming rooms. Dating to this time period, \"Baccarat Banque\" is the earliest form of baccarat; it is a three-person game and mentioned in \"Album des jeux\" by Charles Van-Tenac. Later, \"Chemin de Fer\" emerged as a two-player zero-sum game from \"Baccarat Banque\". \"Chemin de Fer\" is a version which first appeared in the late 19th century. Its name, which is the French term for \"railway\", comes from the version being quicker than the original game, the railway being at that time the fastest means of transport. This version of baccarat remains the most popular in France.\n\"Baccarat Punto Banco\", in which the bettor bets on whether the Player or the Banker hand wins, was a significant change in the development of modern baccarat. It developed into a house-banked game in Havana in the 1940s, and is now the most popular modern form in most parts of the world.\nValuation of hands.\nIn baccarat, the 2 through 9 cards (of any suit) are worth face value (in points); the 10, jack, queen, and king are worth zero; aces are worth one point; jokers are not used. The value of the hand is the units digit of the sum of the constituent cards, known as modulo ten arithmetic. For example, a hand consisting of 2 and 3 is worth five, while a hand consisting of 6 and 7 is worth three, that being the value of the units digit in the combined point total of thirteen. The highest possible hand value in baccarat is therefore nine.\nVersions.\n\"Punto banco\".\n\"Punto banco\" is nowadays the most played version of baccarat in the United States.231 In \"punto banco\", the casino banks the game at all times, and commits to playing out both hands according to fixed drawing rules, known as the \"tableau\" (French: \"board\"), in contrast to more historic baccarat games where each hand is associated with an individual who makes drawing choices. The player (\"punto\") and banker (\"banco\") are simply designations for the two hands dealt out in each coup, two outcomes which the bettor can back; the player hand has no particular association with the gambler, nor the banker hand with the house.\n\"Punto banco\" is dealt from a shoe containing 6 or 8 decks of cards shuffled together; a cut card is placed in front of the seventh from last card, and the drawing of the cut-card indicates the last coup of the shoe. The dealer burns the first card face up and then based on its respective numerical value, with aces worth 1 and face cards worth 10, the dealer burns that many cards face down. For each coup, two cards are dealt face up to each hand, starting from \"player\" and alternating between the hands. The croupier may call the total (e.g., \"five player, three banker\"). If either the player or banker or both achieve a total of 8 or 9 at this stage, the coup is finished and the result is announced: a player win, a banker win, or tie. If neither hand has eight or nine, the drawing rules are applied to determine whether the player should receive a third card. Then, based on the value of any card drawn to the player, the drawing rules are applied to determine whether the banker should receive a third card. The coup is then finished, the outcome is announced, and winning bets are paid out.\n\"Punto banco\" is a pure game of chance and therefore it is not possible for a gambler's bets to be rationally motivated.230\nTableau of drawing rules.\nIf neither the player nor the banker is dealt a total of 8 or 9 in the first two cards (known as a \"natural\"), the tableau is consulted, first for the player's rules, then the banker's.\n If the player has an initial total of 5 or less, they draw a third card. If the player has an initial total of 6 or 7, they stand.\n If the player stood pat (i.e. has only two cards), the banker regards only their own hand and acts according to the same rule as the player, i.e. the banker draws a third card with a total of 5 or less and stands with a total of 6 or 7.\n If the player drew a third card, the banker acts according to the more complex rules as follows:\nThe croupier will deal the cards according to the tableau and the croupier will announce the winning hand, either the player or the banker. Losing bets will be collected and the winning bets will be paid according to the rules of the house. Usually, 1-to-1 even money will be paid on player bets and 19-to-20 on banker bets (even money with \"5% commission to the house on the win\").\nShould both the player and banker have the same total value at the end of the deal, the croupier shall announce \"\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u2014 tie bets win.\" All tie bets will be paid at 8-to-1 odds and all bets on player or banker remain in place and active for the next game (the customer may or may not be able to retract these bets depending on casino rules).\nCasino provision.\nIn the U.S., the full-scale version of \"punto banco\" is usually played at large tables in roped off areas or private rooms separated from the main gaming floor. The game is frequented by high rollers, who may wager tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on a single hand. Minimum bets are relatively high, often starting at $100 and going as high as $500. Posted maximum bets are often arranged to suit a player. The table is staffed by a croupier, who directs the play of the game, and two dealers who calculate tax and collect and pay bets. Six or eight decks of cards are used, normally shuffled only by the croupier and dealers. The shoe is held by one of the players, who deals the cards on the instructions of the croupier according to the tableau. On a player win, the shoe moves either to the highest winning bettor, or to the next person in clockwise order around the table, depending on the casino's conventions. The shoe may be refused or the croupier may be requested to deal.\nOdds and strategy.\n\"Punto banco\" has both some of the lowest house edges among casino table games, and some of the highest. The player bet has, relative to most casino bets, a low house edge of 1.24%, and the banker bet (accounting for the 5% commission on the win) is even lower, at 1.06%. In contrast, the tie bet, which pays 8-to-1, has a high house edge of 14.4%. Most casinos in the United Kingdom pay the tie at 9-to-1, resulting in a house edge of approximately 4.85%.\nCard counting can be employed to reduce the house edge by about 0.05%. If paired with a technique known as edge sorting, baccarat players can obtain a significant edge versus the casino.\nVariations.\nMini-baccarat is a version of \"punto banco\" played on a small table with smaller minimums/maximums. It is popular with the more casual players, particularly those from Asia, where this version is commonly played.\nA mini-baccarat variation where even money is paid on winning banker bets (rather than 95%), except when the banker wins with 6, in which case the banker bet pays 1-to-2 (50% of the bet), goes under various names including \"Super 6\" and \"Punto 2000\". The house edge on a banker bet under Super 6 is 1.46% compared to regular commission baccarat's 1.058%. This is equivalent to increasing the commission by 17.45% to 5.87%. The banker wins with a 6 about five times in an eight-deck shoe. In addition to its increased house edge, the Super 6 variation is used by casinos for its speed, since it partially does away with the time-consuming process of calculating and collecting commission on winning banker bets except for winning with a 6.\nIn a similar variation called \"EZ-baccarat\", even money is paid on both winning banker or player bets, except when the banker wins with a total of 7 after the third card is drawn, which results in a push on banker bets. The game has two additional options, the \"Dragon 7\", a specific bet of a winning three-card 7 on the banker side, which pays 40-to-1 instead of pushing, and \"Panda 8\", a bet of a winning three-card 8 on the player side, which pays 25-to-1.\nSix decks of cards are used, shuffled together. Players are seated in random order, typically around an oval table; discarded cards go to the center. Play begins to the right of the croupier and continues counterclockwise.\nOnce play begins, one player is designated as the banker; this player also deals. The other players are \"punters\". The position of banker passes counterclockwise in the course of the game. In each round, the banker wagers the amount they are willing to risk. Each other player, in order, then declares whether they will \"go bank\", playing against the entire current bank with a matching wager. A maximum of one player may \"go bank\". If no one \"goes bank\", players make their wagers in order. If the total wagers from the players are less than the bank, observing bystanders may also wager up to the amount of the bank. If the total wagers from the players are greater than the bank, the banker may choose to increase the bank to match; otherwise, the excess wagers are removed in reverse play order.\nThe banker deals four cards face-down: two to themselves and two held in common by the remaining players. The player with the highest individual wager (or first in play order if tied for highest wager) is selected to represent the group of non-banker players. The banker and player both look at their cards; if either has an eight or a nine, this is immediately announced and the hands are turned face-up and compared. If neither hand is an eight or nine, the player has a choice to accept or refuse a third card; if accepted, it is dealt face-up. Traditional practice \u2013 grounded in mathematics, similar to basic strategy in blackjack, but further enforced via social sanctions by the other individuals whose money is at stake \u2013 dictates that one always accept a card if one's hand totals between 0 and 4, inclusive, and always refuse a card if it totals 6 or 7. After the player finishes, the banker, in turn, decides either to accept or to refuse another card. Once both the banker and the representative player have made their decision, the hands are turned face-up and compared.\nIf the player's hand exceeds the banker's hand when they are compared, each wagering player receives back their wager and a matching amount from the bank, and the position of banker passes to the next player in order. If the banker's hand exceeds the player's hand, all wagers are forfeit and placed into the bank, and the banker position does not change. If there is a tie, wagers remain as they are for the next hand.\nIf the banker wishes to withdraw, the new banker is the first player in order willing to stake an amount equal to the current bank total. If no one is willing to stake this amount, the new banker is instead the next player in order, and the bank resets to whatever they wish to stake. Many games have a set minimum bank or wager amount.\nUnlike \"punto banco\", which is purely a game of chance, \"chemin de fer\" includes an element of player skill.231\n\"Baccarat banque\".\nIn \"baccarat banque\" the position of banker is more permanent compared to \"chemin de fer\". The shoe contains three inter-shuffled decks. The banker, unless they retire because they wish to or ran out of money to stake, keeps their role until all these cards have been dealt.\nThe banker is initially determined via auctioning, i.e. is given to the player who will undertake to risk the largest amount. In some circles, the person who has first set down their name on the list of players has the right to hold the first bank, risking such amount as they may think proper.\nWhen a banker is determined, they sit opposite the croupier with the discard area between. On both sides of the banker are the punters (traditionally, ten such constituting a full table). Other players cannot sit directly and may only bet when active players' bets don't cover the banker's stakes.\nThe croupier shuffles the cards then prompts one punter from their right, one from their left then the banker to reshuffle and finally selects a random player to cut. After every player has bet, the banker deals one card to one of the right punters, the second to one of the left punters, and the third to themselves. This is done twice, resulting in 6 cards on the table. Each side wins or loses depending on the cards dealt to that side only. The rules as to turning up with eight or nine, offering and accepting cards, and so on, are the same as \"chemin de fer\".\nEach punter continues to hold the cards for their side so long as they win or tie. If they lose, the next hand is dealt to the player next following them in rotation.\nIn each side, any player may \"go bank\", like in \"chemin de fer\". If two players on opposite sides desire to \"go bank\", each player bets half the bank.\nA player going bank may either do so for as many times as they like until they lose, or as a cheval, i.e. on two hands separately, one-half of the stake being played upon each hand. A player going bank and losing may go bank again, until they lose for the third time.\nA banker must play out one hand, but may retire at any time afterwards. On retiring, they must state the amount they retire with. It is then open to any other player (in order of rotation) to continue the bank, starting with the same stake and dealing from undealt cards. The outgoing banker takes the place previously occupied by their successor.\nShould the bank empty, the banker may freely put more money at stake without losing their right to bank.\nIf all punters' bets exceed the bank stake, the banker does not need to put more money. In the event of their losing, the croupier pays the punters in order of rotation until the bank runs out of money. The remainders are returned. The banker may, however, choose to accept the bets and increase their own stakes anyway. If they do so, the bank becomes unlimited and the banker must either cover all bets posted by all players or give up the bank.\nMacao.\nMacao uses two decks of cards shuffled together. Punters place their bets (within the agreed limits) against the banker. Initially, one card is dealt clockwise and face down to every player by the banker. The punters' objective is to beat the banker's card value or risk losing their bet. In case of a tie, whoever has the same value with fewer cards wins. The banker wins if there is a tie in both value and number of cards (in an early version, all bets are off). Any punter who receives a natural 9 receives triple the amount of the bet as long as the banker does not have a natural 9 too. Winning with a natural 8 awards double while winning with a 7 or under is only equal to the bet. Players can request additional cards which are dealt face up; if it is a ten or a face card, they can reject it and ask for another. In an early version of this game, going over 9 with extra cards amounts to a \"bust\" as in blackjack, later versions use modulo 10 arithmetic as in the other games. Beating the banker with a pair only awards an equal amount to the bet. When the deck is exhausted, the player to the banker's left becomes the new banker.\nVictoria is a variation of Macao where players are initially dealt two cards.\nEconomy.\nAmerican casinos are generating an increasing amount of their revenue from baccarat play. For example, in May 2012, Nevada only generated 18.3% of its total table gaming win from baccarat. However, in May 2013, this percentage increased to 33.1% and in May 2014 it rose to 45.2%.\nBaccarat is the most important table game in Macau, with taxes from baccarat play constituting the largest single source of public funding in Macau.22 About 91% of total income from Macau casinos in 2014 came from the punto banco variation.\nIn popular culture.\nRoyal baccarat scandal.\nThe Tranby Croft affair in 1891 and William Gordon Cumming's subsequent lawsuit were known together as the royal baccarat scandal, due to the involvement of the future King Edward VII. Since the Prince of Wales was involved in the incident, it inspired a huge amount of media interest in the game, bringing baccarat to the attention of the public at large. Accounts of the scandal in newspapers also included the rules for the game. The scandal became the subject of music hall songs and a stage play.\nJames Bond.\nBaccarat \"chemin-de-fer\" is the favoured game of James Bond, the fictional secret agent created by Ian Fleming. Bond plays the game in numerous novels,231 most notably his 1953 debut, \"Casino Royale\", in which much of the plot revolves around a game between Bond and SMERSH operative Le Chiffre; the unabridged version of the novel includes a primer to the game for readers who are unfamiliar with it. It is also featured in several filmed versions of the character,231 including the 1954 television adaptation of \"Casino Royale\", where Bond bankrupts Le Chiffre in order to have him eliminated by his Soviet superiors; \"Dr. No\", where Bond is first introduced while playing the game in film; \"Thunderball\"; the 1967 version of \"Casino Royale\", which is the most detailed treatment of a baccarat game in any Bond film; \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\"; \"For Your Eyes Only\"; and \"GoldenEye\".\nIn the 2006 movie adaptation of \"Casino Royale\", baccarat is replaced by Texas hold 'em poker, largely due to the poker boom at the time of filming.\nPhil Ivey controversy.\nThe advantage play technique of edge sorting gained attention in 2012, when a casino in the United Kingdom refused to pay professional gambler Phil Ivey about $11 million, after they determined that he had used the technique to gain an advantage over the house. The same year, Ivey and a female companion won $9.6 million at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City using edge sorting and another $500,000 playing craps using his gains as a stake in the game. The Borgata paid him after his win but then sued Ivey in 2014 after surveillance video showed he had manipulated the dealer into rotating certain cards in the deck to exploit the flaw on the back of the cards. The Borgata prevailed and won $10.1 million, which Ivey refused to pay. In February 2019, the Borgata received approval from the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey to go after Ivey's assets in the state of Nevada, since he had no assets in the state of New Jersey to pursue. Ivey and the Borgata reached a settlement in July 2020.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bactria was strategically located south of Sogdia and west of the Pamir Mountains. These mountain ranges acted as \"walls\" protecting Bactria from three sides, with the Pamir mountains to the north and the Hindu Kush to the south forming a junction, and the Karakoram range towards the east.\nCalled \"beautiful Bactria, crowned with flags\" by the Avesta, the region is considered, in the Zoroastrian faith, to be one of the \"sixteen perfect Iranian lands\" that the supreme deity, Ahura Mazda, had created. It was once a small and independent kingdom struggling to survive against nomadic Turanians. One of the early centres of Zoroastrianism, and capital of the legendary Kayanian dynasty, Bactria is mentioned in the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great as one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire; it was a special satrapy, ruled by a crown prince or an intended heir. Bactria was the centre of Iranian resistance against the Greek Macedonian invaders after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in the 4th century BC, but eventually fell to Alexander the Great.\nAfter the death of Alexander, Bactria fell to his general, Seleucus I. The Seleucids lost the region to the satrap Diodotus I, when he declared independence; thus marking the beginning of the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek Kingdoms. By the 2nd century BC, Bactria was conquered by the Parthian Empire, and, in the early 1st century, by the Kushan Empire, believed to have been founded by the Yuezhi. Bactrian (natively known as , 'Iranian'), an Eastern Iranian language, was the common language of Bactria and the surroundings areas, from ancient until early medieval times.\nShapur I, the second Sasanian King of Kings of Iran, conquered western parts of the Kushan Empire in the 3rd century, and the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom was established. The Sasanians lost Bactria in the 4th century, but reconquered it in the 6th century.\nThe Islamization of Bactria began with the Muslim conquest of Iran in the 7th century. The capital city of Bactra was the centre of an Iranian Renaissance in the 8th and 9th centuries, and New Persian as an independent literary language first emerged in this region. The Samanid Empire was formed in Eastern Iran by the descendants of Saman Khuda, a Persian from Bactria, leading to the spread of the Persian language in the region, and the decline of Bactrian.\nEtymology.\nThe modern English name of the region is Bactria. Historically, the region was first mentioned in Avestan as \"Bakhdi\" in Old Persian. This later developed into \"B\u0101xtri\u0161\" in Middle Persian and \"Baxl in\" New Persian. The modern name is derived from the (Romanized Greek term: \"Baktrian\u0113\"), which is the Hellenized version of the Bactrian endonym. Other cognates include (Romanized: ). \u0628\u0644\u062e (Romanized: \"Balx\"), Chinese \u5927\u590f (pinyin: \"D\u00e0xi\u00e0\"), Latin Bactriana. The region was mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts as \u092c\u093e\u0939\u094d\u0932\u0940\u0915 or \"B\u0101hl\u012bka\".\nWilhelm Eilers proposed that the region was named after the Balkh River (in Greek transliteration \"\u0392\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\") from underlying \"B\u0101xtri-\", itself meaning 'she who divides', from the Proto-Indo-European root *\"bhag-\" 'to divide' (whence also Avestan and Old Indic ).\nBactria is the geographic location after which Bactrian camels are named.\nHistory.\nBronze Age.\nThe Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC, also known as the \"Oxus civilization\") is the modern archaeological designation for a Bronze Age archaeological culture of Central Asia, dated to c.\u20092200\u20131700 BC, located in present-day eastern Turkmenistan, northern Afghanistan, southern Uzbekistan and western Tajikistan, centred on the upper Amu Darya (known to the ancient Greeks as the Oxus River), an area covering ancient Bactria. Its sites were discovered and named by the Soviet archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi (1976). Bactria was the Greek name for Old Persian \"B\u0101xtri\u0161\" (from native *\"B\u0101x\u00e7i\u0161\") (named for its capital Bactra, modern Balkh), in what is now northern Afghanistan, and \"Margiana\" was the Greek name for the Persian satrapy of Margu, the capital of which was Merv, in today's Turkmenistan.\nThe early Greek historian Ctesias, c.\u2009400 BC (followed by Diodorus Siculus), alleged that the legendary Assyrian king Ninus had defeated a Bactrian king named Oxyartes in c.\u20092140 BC, or some 1000 years before the Trojan War. Since the decipherment of cuneiform script in the 19th century, however, which enabled actual Assyrian records to be read, historians have ascribed little value to the Greek account.\nAccording to some writers, Bactria was the homeland (Airyanem Vaejah) of Indo-Iranians who moved south-west into Iran and the north-west of the South Asian subcontinent around 2500\u20132000 BC. Later, it became the northern province of the Achaemenid Empire in Central Asia. It was in these regions, where the fertile soil of the mountainous country is surrounded by the Turan Depression, that the prophet Zoroaster was said to have been born and gained his first adherents. Avestan, the language of the oldest portions of the Zoroastrian \"Avesta\", was one of the Old Iranian languages, and is the oldest attested member of the Eastern Iranian languages.\nAchaemenid Empire.\nErnst Herzfeld suggested that Bactria belonged to the Medes before its annexation to the Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great in sixth century BC, after which it and Margiana formed the twelfth satrapy of Persia. After Darius III had been defeated by Alexander the Great, the satrap of Bactria, Bessus, attempted to organize a national resistance but was captured by other warlords and delivered to Alexander. He was then tortured and killed.\nUnder Persian rule, many Greeks were deported to Bactria, so that their communities and language became common in the area. During the reign of Darius I, the inhabitants of the Greek city of Barca, in Cyrenaica, were deported to Bactria for refusing to surrender assassins. In addition, Xerxes also settled the \"Branchidae\" in Bactria; they were the descendants of Greek priests who had once lived near Didyma (western Asia Minor) and betrayed the temple to him. Herodotus also records a Persian commander threatening to enslave daughters of the revolting Ionians and send them to Bactria. Persia subsequently conscripted Greek men from these settlements in Bactria into their military, as did Alexander later.\nAlexander the Great.\nAlexander conquered Sogdiana. In the south, beyond the Oxus, he met strong resistance, but ultimately conquered the region through both military force and diplomacy, marrying Roxana, daughter of the defeated Satrap of Bactria, Oxyartes. He founded two Greek cities in Bactria, including his easternmost, Alexandria Eschate (Alexandria the Furthest).\nAfter Alexander's death, Diodorus Siculus tells us that Philip received dominion over Bactria, but Justin names Amyntas to that role. At the Treaty of Triparadisus, both Diodorus Siculus and Arrian agree that the satrap Stasanor gained control over Bactria. Eventually, Alexander's empire was divided up among the generals in Alexander's army. Bactria became a part of the Seleucid Empire, named after its founder, Seleucus I.\nSeleucid Empire.\nThe Macedonians, especially Seleucus I and his son Antiochus I, established the Seleucid Empire and founded a number of Greek towns. The Greek language became dominant for some time there.\nThe paradox that Greek presence was more prominent in Bactria than in areas far closer to Greece can possibly be explained by past deportations of Greeks to Bactria. When Alexander's troops entered Bactria they discovered communities of Greeks who appeared to have been deported to the region by the Persians in previous centuries.\nGreco-Bactrian Kingdom.\nConsiderable difficulties faced by the Seleucid kings and the attacks of Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus gave the satrap of Bactria, Diodotus I, the opportunity to declare independence about 245 BC and conquer Sogdia. He was the founder of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. Diodotus and his successors were able to maintain themselves against the attacks of the Seleucids\u2014particularly from Antiochus III the Great, who was ultimately defeated by the Romans (190 BC).\nThe Greco-Bactrians were so powerful that they were able to expand their territory as far as South Asia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As for Bactria, a part of it lies alongside Aria towards the north, though most of it lies above Aria and to the east of it. And much of it produces everything except oil. The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters, not only of Bactria and beyond, but also of India, as Apollodorus of Artemita says: and more tribes were subdued by them than by Alexander...\"\nThe last Greco-Bactrian king Heliocles I lost control of Bactria to nomadic invaders near the end of the 2nd century BC, at which point Greek political power ceased in Bactria, but Greek cultural influence continued for many more centuries. The Greco-Bactrians used the Greek language for administrative purposes, and the local Bactrian language was also Hellenized, as suggested by its adoption of the Greek alphabet and Greek loanwords.\nIndo-Greek Kingdom.\nThe Bactrian king Euthydemus I and his son Demetrius I crossed the Hindu Kush mountains and began the conquest of the Indus valley. For a short time, they wielded great power: a great Greek empire seemed to have arisen far in the East. But this empire was torn by internal dissension and continual usurpations. When Demetrius advanced far east of the Indus River, one of his generals, Eucratides, made himself king of Bactria, and soon in every province there arose new usurpers, who proclaimed themselves kings and fought against each other. For example Eucratides is known to have battled another king named Demetrius of India, probably Demetrius II, the latter ultimately being defeated according to the historian Justin.\nMost of them we know only by their coins, a great many of which are found in Afghanistan. By these wars, the dominant position of the Greeks was undermined even more quickly than would otherwise have been the case. After Demetrius and Eucratides, the kings abandoned the Attic standard of coinage and introduced a native standard, no doubt to gain support from outside the Greek minority.\nIn the Indus valley, this went even further. The Indo-Greek king Menander I (known as Milinda in South Asia), recognized as a great conqueror, converted to Buddhism. His successors managed to cling to power until the last known Indo-Greek ruler, a king named Strato II, who ruled in the Punjab region until around 55 BC. Other sources, however, place the end of Strato II's reign as late as 10 AD.\nDaxia, Tukhara and Tokharistan.\n\"Daxia\", \"Ta-Hsia\", or \"Ta-Hia\" () was the name given in antiquity by the Han Chinese to Tukhara or Tokhara: the central part of Bactria. The name \"Daxia\" appears in Chinese from the 3rd century BC to designate a little-known kingdom located somewhere west of China. This was possibly a consequence of the first contacts between China and the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom.\nDuring the 2nd century BC, the Greco-Bactrians were conquered by nomadic Indo-European tribes from the north, beginning with the Sakas (160 BC). The Sakas were overthrown in turn by the Da Yuezhi (\"Greater Yuezhi\") during subsequent decades. The Yuezhi had conquered Bactria by the time of the visit of the Chinese envoy Zhang Qian (circa 127 BC), who had been sent by the Han emperor to investigate lands to the west of China. The first mention of these events in European literature appeared in the 1st century BC, when Strabo described how \"the Asii, Pasiani, Tokhari, and Sakarauli\" had taken part in the \"destruction of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom\". Ptolemy subsequently mentioned the central role of the Tokhari among other tribes in Bactria. As \"Tukhara\" or \"Tokhara\" it included areas that were later part of Surxondaryo Region in Uzbekistan, southern Tajikistan and northern Afghanistan. The Tokhari spoke a language known later as Bactrian \u2013 an Iranian language. (The Tokhari and their language should not be confused with the Tocharian people who lived in the Tarim Basin between the 3rd and 9th centuries AD, or the Tocharian languages that form another branch of Indo-European languages.)\nThe name Daxia was used in the \"Shiji\" (\"Records of the Grand Historian\") by Sima Qian. Based on the reports of Zhang Qian, the \"Shiji\" describe Daxia as an important urban civilization of about one million people, living in walled cities under small city kings or magistrates. Daxia was an affluent country with rich markets, trading in an incredible variety of objects, coming from as far as Southern China. By the time Zhang Qian visited, there was no longer a major king, and the Bactrians were under the suzerainty of the Yuezhi. Zhang Qian depicted a rather sophisticated but demoralised people who were afraid of war. Following these reports, the Chinese emperor Wu Di was informed of the level of sophistication of the urban civilizations of Ferghana, Bactria and Parthia, and became interested in developing commercial relationship with them: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Son of Heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus: Dayuan and the possessions of Daxia and Anxi Parthia are large countries, full of rare things, with a population living in fixed abodes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the people of Han, but with weak armies, and placing great value on the rich produce of China. These contacts immediately led to the dispatch of multiple embassies from the Chinese, which helped to develop trade along the Silk Roads.\nKujula Kadphises, the \"xihou\" (prince) of the Yuezhi, united the region in the early 1st century and laid the foundations for the powerful, but short-lived, Kushan Empire. In the 3rd century AD, Tukhara was under the rule of the \"Kushanshas\" (Indo-Sasanians).\nTokharistan.\nThe form Tokharistan \u2013 the suffix \"-stan\" means \"place of\" in Persian \u2013 appeared for the first time in the 4th century, in Buddhist texts, such as the \"Vibhasa-sastra\". Tokhara was known in Chinese sources as \"Tuhuluo\" (\u5410\u547c\u7f85) which is first mentioned during the Northern Wei era. In the Tang dynasty, the name is transcribed as Tuhuoluo (\u571f\u8c41\u7f85). Other Chinese names are Doushaluo \u515c\u6c99\u7f85, Douquluo \u515c\u4f49\u7f85 or Duhuoluo \u89a9\u8ca8\u7f85. During the 5th century AD, Bactria was controlled by the Xionites and the Hephthalites, but was subsequently reconquered by the Sassanid Empire.\nIntroduction of Islam.\nBy the mid-7th century AD, Islam under the Rashidun Caliphate had come to rule much of the Middle East and western areas of Central Asia.\nIn 663 AD, the Umayyad Caliphate attacked the Buddhist Shahi dynasty ruling in Tokharistan. The Umayyad forces captured the area around Balkh, including the Buddhist monastery at Nava Vihara, causing the Shahis to retreat to the Kabul Valley.\nIn the 8th century AD, a Persian from Balkh known as Saman Khuda left Zoroastrianism for Islam while living under the Umayyads. His children founded the Samanid Empire (875\u2013999 AD). Persian became the official language and had a higher status than Bactrian, because it was the language of Muslim rulers. It eventually replaced the latter as the common language due to the preferential treatment as well as colonization.\nGeography.\nThe Bactrian plain lay between the Amu Darya (ancient Oxus River) to the north and the Hindu Kush mountain range to the south and east. On its western side, the region was bordered by the great Carmanian desert and the plain of Margiana.\nThe Amu Darya and smaller rivers such as (from west to east) the Shirin Tagab River, Sari Pul River, Balkh River and Kunduz River have been used for irrigation for millennia. The land was noted for its fertility and its ability to produce most ancient Greek agricultural products, with the notable exception of olives.\nAccording to Pierre Leriche:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBactrian people.\nSeveral important trade routes from India and China (including the Silk Road) passed through Bactria and, as early as the Bronze Age, this had allowed the accumulation of vast amounts of wealth by the mostly nomadic population. The first proto-urban civilization in the area arose during the 2nd millennium BC.\nControl of these lucrative trade routes, however, attracted foreign interest, and in the 6th century BC the Bactrians were conquered by the Persians, and in the 4th century BC by Alexander the Great. These conquests marked the end of Bactrian independence. From around 304 BC the area formed part of the Seleucid Empire, and from around 250 BC it was the centre of a Greco-Bactrian kingdom, ruled by the descendants of Greeks who had settled there following the conquest of Alexander the Great.\nThe Greco-Bactrians, also known in Sanskrit as Yavanas, worked in cooperation with the native Bactrian aristocracy. By the early 2nd century BC the Greco-Bactrians had created an impressive empire that stretched southwards to include north-west India. By about 135 BC, however, this kingdom had been overrun by invading Yuezhi tribes, an invasion that later brought about the rise of the powerful Kushan Empire.\nBactrians were recorded in Strabo's \"Geography\":\nNow in early times the Sogdians and Bactrians did not differ much from the nomads in their modes of life and customs, although the Bactrians were a little more civilised; however, of these, as of the others, Onesicritus does not report their best traits, saying, for instance, that those who have become helpless because of old age or sickness are thrown out alive as prey to dogs kept expressly for this purpose, which in their native tongue are called \"undertakers,\" and that while the land outside the walls of the metropolis of the Bactrians looks clean, yet most of the land inside the walls is full of human bones; but that Alexander broke up the custom.\nThe Bactrians spoke Bactrian, a north-eastern Iranian language. Bactrian became extinct, replaced by north-eastern Iranian languages such as Munji, Yidgha, Ishkashimi, and Pashto. The \"Encyclopaedia Iranica\" states:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Bactrian thus occupies an intermediary position between Pashto and Yidgha-Munji on the one hand, Sogdian, Choresmian, and Parthian on the other: it is thus in its natural and rightful place in Bactria. The principal religions of the area before the Islamic invasion were Zoroastrianism and Buddhism.\nContemporary Tajiks are the descendants of ancient Eastern Iranian inhabitants of Central Asia, in particular, the Sogdians and the Bactrians, and possibly other groups, with an admixture of Western Iranian Persians and non-Iranian peoples. The \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" states:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Tajiks are the direct descendants of the Iranian peoples whose continuous presence in Central Asia and northern Afghanistan is attested from the middle of the 1st millennium BC. The ancestors of the Tajiks constituted the core of the ancient population of Khw\u0101rezm (Khorezm) and Bactria, which formed part of Transoxania (Sogdiana). They were included in the empires of Persia and Alexander the Great, and they intermingled with such later invaders as the Kush\u0101ns and Hepthalites in the 1st\u20136th centuries AD. Over the course of time, the eastern Iranian dialect that was used by the ancient Tajiks eventually gave way to Persian, a western dialect spoken in Iran and Afghanistan.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Deneuve had two sisters, Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac (21 March 1942 \u2013 26 June 1967) and Sylvie Dorl\u00e9ac (born 14 December 1946), as well as a maternal half-sister, Dani\u00e8le, whom their mother had out of wedlock in 1936 with Aim\u00e9 Clariond. Deneuve used her mother's maiden name, which she chose for her stage name, in order to differentiate herself from her sisters. Deneuve attended Catholic schools.\nFilm career.\n1957\u20131970: Breakthrough and acclaim.\nDeneuve made her film debut with a small role in Andr\u00e9 Hunebelle's \"Les Coll\u00e9giennes\" (1957) with her younger sister Sylvie Dorl\u00e9ac who, like their older half-sister Daniele, was an occasional child actress. She subsequently appeared in several films for director Roger Vadim as well as in \"L'Homme \u00e0 femmes\u200a\" (1960), which caught the eye of Jacques Demy, who cast Deneuve as Genevi\u00e8ve Emery in his romantic film musical \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" (1964), the film that brought her to stardom. The film received critical acclaim winning the Palme d'Or at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival. \"Variety\" praised her performance, writing, \"Catherine Deneuve, a winsome-looking type that other directors have forced to act, here is allowed to be herself. She etches a fine portrait of a 16-year-old in love.\" The same year she acted in several films including the anthology film \"The World's Most Beautiful Swindlers\" in a segment directed by Claude Chabrol and the comedy \"Male Hunt\" directed by \u00c9douard Molinaro. \nIn her English-language debut, Deneuve played the cold but erotic persona, for which she would be nicknamed the \"ice maiden\", in Roman Polanski's psychological horror thriller \"Repulsion\" (1965). For her performance she was nominated for the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" wrote, \"Catherine Deneuve's glassy stare of anxiety dominates the movie\" comparing her to Janet Leigh in \"Psycho\" (1960). In 1966 she starred in the Agn\u00e8s Varda fantasy film \"Les Cr\u00e9atures\" and Jean-Paul Rappeneau's \"A Matter of Resistance\".

That same year she acted in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's romantic crime drama \"Mississippi Mermaid\" acting alongside Jean-Paul Belmondo. \"The New York Times\" film critic Vincent Canby praised the film writing, \"As in all of Truffaut's films, love leads only to an uncertain future that, at best, may contain some joy along with the inevitable misery. Truffaut's special talent, however, is for communicating a sense of the value of that joy.\" She reunited with Bu\u00f1el for the drama \"Tristana\" (1970) acting alongside Fernando Rey and Franco Nero. Her work for Bu\u00f1uel would be her best known.

She co-starred alongside Catherine Frot, in writer/director Martin Provost's French drama \"The Midwife\" (2017).\nCareer outside film.\nModeling.\nDeneuve appeared nude in two \"Playboy\" pictorials in 1963 and 1965. Her image was used to represent Marianne, the national symbol of France, from 1985 to 1989. As the face of Chanel No. 5 in the late 1970s, she caused sales of the perfume to soar in the United States\u00a0\u2013 so much so that the American press, captivated by her charm, nominated her as the world's most elegant woman. In 1983, American Home Products retained her to represent their cosmetics line and hired world-renowned photographer Richard Avedon to promote its line of \"Youth Garde\" cosmetics, for which she famously proclaimed, \"Look closely. Next year, I will be 40.\"\nShe is considered the muse of designer Yves Saint Laurent; he dressed her in the films \"Belle de Jour\", \"La Chamade\", \"La sir\u00e8ne du Mississippi\", \"Un flic\", \"Liza\", and \"The Hunger\". In 1992, she became a model for his skincare line.\nIn 2001, she was chosen as the new face of L'Or\u00e9al Paris. In 2006, Deneuve became the third inspiration for the M\u2022A\u2022C Beauty Icon series and collaborated on the colour collection that became available at M\u2022A\u2022C locations worldwide in February that year. Deneuve began appearing in the new Louis Vuitton luggage advertisements in 2007. Deneuve was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s by the \"Guardian\" in March 2013. In July 2017, Deneuve appeared in a video campaign for Louis Vuitton entitled \"Connected Journeys\", celebrating the launch of the brand's Tambour Horizon smartwatch, which also featured celebrities, including Jennifer Connelly, Bae Doona, Jaden Smith and Miranda Kerr.\nEntrepreneurial.\nIn 1986, Deneuve introduced her own perfume, \"Deneuve\".

She has five grandchildren. Deneuve has not had a public relationship since her breakup with Lescure in 1991, with whom she remains friends; Deneuve's two children consider him their stepfather. According to \"Gala\", in late 2019 Deneuve relied on Lescure while she recuperated from a stroke. In 2020, she told \"Paris Match\" that the two still talk to each other every day.\nRelationships.\nThroughout her 20s and 30s, Deneuve reportedly dated actors Sami Frey, Clint Eastwood, Franco Nero, Burt Reynolds and John Travolta as well as directors Roman Polanski, Jerry Schatzberg, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and Milos Forman, talent agent Bertrand de Labbey, singer Serge Gainsbourg, though she denies an intimate relationship with Gainsbourg. She is also rumoured to have had a brief relationship with TV host Carlos Lozano.\nIn recent decades, Deneuve's highly private life has prompted speculation about her sexual orientation, which she acknowledged in a 2002 interview with \"Knack\" magazine: \"Now that people know nothing about my private life, they start guessing: is there still a man in her life and who is he then? When they see me two or three times with a female friend they say: we've always known that.\" In 2006, Deneuve told \"The Daily Telegraph\" that she was in a relationship, though she did not disclose his name.\nA 2020 biography of Johnny Hallyday by Gilles Lhote says the singer maintained a carefully hidden, 56-year affair with Deneuve that started when they were teenagers in 1961 and continued until Hallyday's death in 2017. \nDeneuve was a close friend of the artist Nall, and owns some of his works.\nHealth.\nOn 6 November 2019, BBC News reported that Deneuve suffered a mild stroke and was recuperating in a Paris hospital.

{"id": "45380", "revid": "20560512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45380", "title": "Jean-Paul Belmondo", "text": "French actor (1933\u20132021)\nJean-Paul Charles Belmondo (; 9 April 1933\u00a0\u2013 6 September 2021) was a French actor. Initially associated with the New Wave of the 1960s, he was a major French film star for several decades from the 1960s onward, frequently portraying police officers and criminals in action thriller films. His best known credits include \"Breathless\" (1960), \"That Man from Rio\" (1964), \"Pierrot le Fou\" (1965), \"Borsalino\" (1970), and \"The Professional\" (1981). An undisputed box-office champion along with Louis de Fun\u00e8s and Alain Delon, Belmondo attracted nearly 160 million viewers over his 50-year career. Between 1969 and 1982, he starred in four most popular films of the year in France, surpassed only by de Fun\u00e8s: \"The Brain\" (1969), \"Fear Over the City\" (1975), \"Animal\" (1977), \"Ace of Aces\" (1982).\nBelmondo frequently played heroic, brave, and virile characters, which made him popular with a wide audience both in France and abroad. Despite being heavily courted by Hollywood, Belmondo refused to appear in English-language films. During his career, he was called the French counterpart of actors such as James Dean, Marlon Brando and Humphrey Bogart. Described as an icon and national treasure of France, Belmondo was seen as an influential actor in French cinema and an important figure in shaping European cinema. In 1989, Belmondo won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actor for his performance in \"Itin\u00e9raire d'un enfant g\u00e2t\u00e9\". He was nominated for two BAFTA Awards throughout his career. In 2011, Belmondo received the Palme d'honneur at the Cannes Film Festival, and in 2017 he received the C\u00e9sar d'honneur at the 42nd C\u00e9sar Awards.\nEarly life.\nJean-Paul Belmondo was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, on 9 April 1933. Belmondo's father, Paul Belmondo, was a \"Pied-Noir\" sculptor who was born in Algeria of Italian descent, whose parents were of Sicilian and Piedmontese origin. His mother, \nSarah Madeleine Rainaud-Richard, was a painter. As a boy, he was more interested in sport than school, developing a particular interest in boxing and soccer.\nBelmondo made his amateur boxing debut on 10 May 1949 in Paris when he knocked out Ren\u00e9 Desmarais in one round. Belmondo's boxing career was undefeated, but brief. He won three straight first-round knockout victories from 1949 to 1950. \"I stopped when the face I saw in the mirror began to change\", he later said.\nHe did his National Service in French Algeria where he may have broken his nose \"with a rifle butt to end his military service.\"\nBelmondo was interested in acting. His late teenage years were spent at a private drama school, and he began performing comedy sketches in the provinces. He studied under Raymond Giraud and then attended the Conservatoire of Dramatic Arts when he was twenty. He studied there for three years. He probably would have won the prize for best actor, but he participated in a sketch mocking the school, which offended the jury; this resulted in his getting only an honourable mention, \"which nearly set off a riot among his incensed fellow students\" in August 1956, according to one report. The incident made front-page news.\nCareer.\n1950s.\nBelmondo's acting career properly began in 1953, with two performances at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Atelier in Paris in Jean Anouilh's \"M\u00e9d\u00e9e\" and Georges Neveux's \"Zamore\". Belmondo began touring the provinces with friends including Annie Girardot and Guy Bedos.\nBelmondo first appeared in the short \"Moliere\" (1956). His first film role was a scene with Jean-Pierre Cassel in \"On Foot, on Horse, and on Wheels\" (1957), which was cut from the final film; however he had a bigger part in the follow-up \"A Dog, a Mouse, and a Sputnik\" (1958).\nBelmondo had a small role in the comedy \"Be Beautiful But Shut Up\" (1958), appearing with Alain Delon, followed by a role as a gangster in \"Young Sinners\" (1958), directed by Marcel Carn\u00e9.\nBelmondo supported Bourvil and Arletty in \"Sunday Encounter\" (1958). Jean-Luc Godard directed him in a short, \"Charlotte and Her Boyfriend\" (1958), where Belmondo's voice was dubbed by Godard after Belmondo was conscripted into the army. As part of his compulsory military service, he served in Algeria as a private for six months.\nBelmondo's first lead role was in \"Les Copains du dimanche\" (1958). He later had a supporting part in \"An Angel on Wheels\" (1959) with Romy Schneider then appeared in \"Web of Passion\" (1959) for Claude Chabrol. He played D'Artagnan in \"The Three Musketeers\" (1959) for French television.\n1960s.\nBelmondo starred in \"Consider All Risks\" (1960), a gangster story with Lino Ventura. He then played the lead role in Jean-Luc Godard's \"Breathless\" (\"\u00c0 Bout de Souffle\", 1960), which made him a major figure in the French New Wave.\n\"Breathless\" was a major success in France and overseas and launched Belmondo internationally and as the face of the New Wave \u2013 even though, as he said \"I don't know what they mean\" when people used that term. In the words of \"The New York Times\" it led to his having \"more acting assignments than he can handle.\"\nHe followed it with \"Trapped by Fear\" (1960), then the Italian film \"Letters By a Novice\" (1960). With Jeanne Moreau and director Peter Brook he made \"Seven Days... Seven Nights\" (1961) which he later called \"very boring.\"\nBelmondo appeared as a gigolo in the anthology film \"Love and the Frenchwoman\" (1960). Then he made two Italian films, supporting Sophia Loren in \"Two Women\" (1961) as a bespectacled country boy (\"It may disappoint those who've got me typed\" said Belmondo. \"But so much the better.\"), then opposite Claudia Cardinale in \"The Lovemakers\" (1961).\n\"Two Women\" and \"Breathless\" were widely seen in the United States and the UK. In 1961, \"The New York Times\" called him \"the most impressive young French actor since the advent of the late G\u00e9rard Philipe\".\nHe was reunited with Godard for \"A Woman Is a Woman\" (1961) and made another all-star anthology comedy, \"Famous Love Affairs\" (1961).\nLater, he acted in Jean-Pierre Melville's philosophical movie \"L\u00e9on Morin, Priest\" (1961), playing a priest. He was a retired gangster in \"A Man Named Rocca\" (1962), then had a massive hit with the swashbuckler \"Cartouche\" (1962), directed by Philippe de Broca. Also popular was \"A Monkey in Winter\" (1962), a comedy where he and Jean Gabin played alcoholics.\nFran\u00e7ois Truffaut wanted Belmondo to play the lead in an adaptation of \"Fahrenheit 451\". This did not happen (the film was made several years later with Oskar Werner); instead Belmondo made two movies with Jean-Pierre Melville: the film noir crime film \"The Fingerman\" (\"Le Doulos\", 1963) and \"Magnet of Doom\" (1963). He co-starred with Gina Lollobrigida in \"Mad Sea\" (1963) and appeared in another comedy anthology, \"Sweet and Sour\" (1963). There was some controversy when he was arrested for insulting a policeman, when the policeman was charged with assaulting Belmondo.\n\"Banana Peel\" (1963), with Jeanne Moreau, was a popular comedy. Even more successful was the action-adventure tale \"That Man from Rio\" (1964), directed by Philippe de Broca \u2013 a massive hit in France, and popular overseas as well. A 1965 profile compared him to Humphrey Bogart and James Dean. It stated Belmondo was:\nA later manifestation of youthful rejection... His disengagement from a society his parents made is total. He accepts corruption with a cynical smile, not even bothering to struggle. He is out entirely for himself, to get whatever he can, while he can. The Belmondo type is capable of anything. He knows he is defeated anyway... He represents something tough yet vulnerable, laconic but intense, notably lacking in neuroses or the stumbling insecurities of homus Americanus. He is the man of the moment, completely capable of taking care of himself - and ready to take on the girl of the moment too.\nBelmondo's own tastes ran to Tintin comics, sports magazines, and detective novels. He said he preferred \"making adventure films like \"Rio\" to the intellectual movies of Alain Resnais or Alain Robbe-Grillet. But with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut I'd be willing to try.\" His fee was said to be between US$150,000\u2013$200,000 per film. Belmondo said he was open to making Hollywood films but he wanted to play an American rather than a Frenchman and was interested in Cary Grant type roles instead of James Dean/Bogart ones.\nBelmondo made \"Greed in the Sun\" (1964) with Lino Ventura for director Henri Verneuil, who said Belmondo was \"one of the few young actors in France who is young and manly.\" \"Backfire\" (1964) reunited him with Jean Seberg, his \"Breathless\" co-star. After a role in \"Male Hunt\" (1964) he played the lead in \"Weekend at Dunkirk\" (1965), another big hit in France.\nBelmondo dominated the French box office for 1964 \u2013 \"That Man from Rio\" was the fourth most popular movie in the country, \"Greed in the Sun\" was seventh, \"Weekend at Dunkirk\" ninth, and \"Backfire\" 19th.\n\"Crime on a Summer Morning\" (1965) was less successful, though it still performed well on the strength of Belmondo's name. \"Up to His Ears\" (1965) was an attempt to repeat the popularity of \"That Man Rio\", from the same director, but did less well.\nThere were Hollywood offers, but Belmondo turned them down. \"He won't make films outside of France\", said director Mark Robson, who wanted him for \"Lost Command\" (1966). \"He has scripts stacked up and he doesn't see why he should jeopardise his great success by speaking English instead of French.\"\nBelmondo was reunited with Godard for \"Pierrot le Fou\" (1965) then made a comedy, \"Tender Scoundrel\" (1966). He had small roles in two predominantly English speaking films, \"Is Paris Burning?\" (1966) and \"Casino Royale\" (1967).\nAfter making \"The Thief of Paris\" (1967) for Louis Malle, Belmondo took an acting hiatus for over a year. \"One day it seemed that life was passing me by\", he said. \"I didn't want to work. So I stopped. Then one day I felt like starting again. So I started.\"\nBelmondo spent three months of that time off in Hollywood but did not accept any offers. He did not want to learn English and appear in English-language films:\nEvery Frenchman dreams of making a Western, of course but America has plenty of good actors. I'm not being falsely modest but why would they need me? I prefer a national film to an international film. Something is lost. Look at what happened to Italy when they went international.\nBelmondo returned to filmmaking with the crime movie, \"Ho!\" (1968), then had a massive hit with a comedy co-starring David Niven, \"The Brain\" (1969). He later appeared in \"Mississippi Mermaid\" (1969) for Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut with Catherine Deneuve and the romantic drama \"Love Is a Funny Thing\" (1969).\n1970s.\nBelmondo starred alongside Alain Delon in \"Borsalino\" (1970), a successful gangster film. The latter produced the film and Belmondo ended up suing Delon over billing.\n\"The Married Couple of the Year Two\" (1971) was also popular; even more so was \"The Burglars\" (1971).\nInspired by the success Alain Delon had producing his own films, Belmondo formed his own production company, Cerito Films (named after his grandmother, Rosina Cerrito), to develop movies for Belmondo. The first Cerito film was the black comedy \"Dr. Popaul\" (1972), with Mia Farrow, the biggest hit to date for director Claude Chabrol.\n\"La scoumoune\" (1972) was a new version of \"A Man Named Rocca\" (1961). \"The Inheritor\" (1973) was an action film; \"Le Magnifique\" (1974), a satiric action romance reunited him with Philippe de Broca.\nHe produced as well as starred in \"Stavisky\" (1974). Then he made a series of purely commercial films: \"Incorrigible\" (1974), \"Fear Over the City\" (1975; one of Belmondo's biggest hits of the decade and the first time he played a policeman on screen), \"Hunter Will Get You\" (1976), and \"Body of My Enemy\" (1977). \"Animal\" (1977) cast him as a stuntman opposite Raquel Welch and he starred as a policeman in \"Cop or Hood\" (1979).\n1980s.\nIn 1980, Belmondo starred in another comedy, \"Le Guignolo\". He was a secret service agent in \"The Professional\" (1981) and a pilot in \"Ace of Aces\" (1982).\n\"What intellectuals don't like is success\", said Belmondo. \"Success in France is always looked down on, not by the public, but by intellectuals. If I'm nude in a film, that's fine for the intellectuals. But if I jump from a helicopter, they think it's terrible.\"\nBelmondo kept to commercial films: \"Le Marginal\" (1983) as a policeman, \"Les Morfalous\" (1984) as a sergeant in the French Foreign Legion, \"Hold-Up\" (1985) as a bank robber, and \"Le Solitaire\" (1987), again playing another policeman in the last one, the latter one was a big box office disappointment and Belmondo returned to theatre shortly afterwards.\nIn 1987, he returned to the theatre after a 26-year absence in a production of \"Kean\", adapted by Jean-Paul Sartre from the novel by Alexandre Dumas. \"I did theatre for 10 years before going into movies and every year I planned to go back\", he recalled. \"I returned before I became an old man.\"\nFor Claude Lelouch, Belmondo starred in and co-produced \"Itinerary of a Spoiled Child\" (1988). For his performance in the film, also titled as \" Itineraire d'un Enfant Gate\", he won a C\u00e9sar.\nBelmondo claimed there were \"several reasons\" why he made fewer films in the 1980s. \"I'm now a producer so it takes time to organise things\", he said. \"But it's also difficult to find good screenplays in France. We have serious writing problems here. And I'd prefer to do theatre for a long time than take on a mediocre film.\"\n1990s and later career.\nIn 1990, he played the title role in \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" on the stage in Paris, another highly successful production. He had a small role in \"One Hundred and One Nights\" (1995) then the lead in Lelouch's version of \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (1995). He also appeared in the comedy \"D\u00e9sir\u00e9\" (1996), \"Une chance sur deux\" (1998), and in the science fiction comedy \"Peut-\u00eatre\" (1999).\nIn 2009, Belmondo starred in \"A Man and His Dog\" (\"Un homme et son chien\"), his final film role. Despite his difficulty in walking and speaking, he played a character who had the same disability. Following this film he was forced into retirement in 2011 having earlier suffered a stroke in 2001.\nHonours and awards.\nIn 1989, Belmondo won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actor for his performance in \"Itin\u00e9raire d'un enfant g\u00e2t\u00e9\".\nBelmondo was made a \"Chevalier\" (Knight) of the , promoted to \"Officier\" (Officer) in 1986 and promoted to \"Commandeur\" (Commander) in 1994. He was also made a \"Chevalier\" (Knight) of the Ordre National de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur, promoted \"Officier\" (Officer) in 1991, and promoted to \"Commandeur\" (Commander) in 2007.\nDuring his career, he was nominated for two BAFTA Awards.\nBelmondo received several honorary awards \u2013 Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, Golden Lion at the 2016 Venice Film Festival, and C\u00e9sar in 2017. In 2009, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association gave him a career achievement award.\nIn 2017, he was received a lifetime achievement honor at the 42nd C\u00e9sar Awards accompanied by a two-minute standing ovation.\nPersonal life and death.\nOn 4 December 1952, Belmondo married \u00c9lodie Constantin, with whom he had three children: Patricia (1953\u20131993), who was killed in a fire, Florence (born 1958), and Paul (born 1963). Belmondo and Constantin separated in 1965. She filed for divorce in September 1966, and it was finalised on 5 January 1968.\nHe had relationships with Ursula Andress from 1965 to 1972, Laura Antonelli from 1972 to 1980, Brazilian actress and singer Maria Carlos Sotto Mayor from 1980 to 1987, and Barbara Gandolfi from 2008 to 2012.\nIn 1989, Belmondo was in his mid-50s when he met 24-year-old dancer Natty Tardivel. The couple lived together for over a decade before marrying in 2002. On 13 August 2003, Tardivel gave birth to then 70-year-old Belmondo's fourth child, Stella Eva Angelina. Belmondo and Tardivel divorced in 2008.\nBelmondo was a supporter of football club Paris Saint-Germain.\nBelmondo died on 6 September 2021 at his home in Paris, aged 88. He had been in failing health since he suffered a stroke a decade earlier. A national tribute was held on 9 September in H\u00f4tel des Invalides. President Emmanuel Macron called Belmondo a \"national hero\". The last tribute melody was \"Chi Mai\" by Ennio Morricone (from The 1981 film \"The Professional\"). The next day, 10 September, his funeral took place at the Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s church in the presence of relatives and family. The actors Alain and Anthony Delon also were present. His remains were cremated at the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. Unlike his father, the sculptor Paul Belmondo, who was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery, Jean-Paul had his ashes scattered in the garden of his childhood home in Piriac-sur-Mer, in Loire-Atlantique.\nLegacy.\nThroughout his career, he was called the French counterpart of actors such as James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Humphrey Bogart. On the day of his death, television channels in France altered their schedules to add screenings of his films, which drew over 6.5 million viewers cumulatively. For his performances as a police officer in many films, the National Police said that \"Even if it was just cinema you were in a way one of us, Mr. Belmondo\". Throughout his career, he was regarded as an influential French actor and was often seen as the face of the French New Wave. Belmondo was described as the \"figurehead\" of the French New Wave, with his acting techniques often seen as capturing the style and imagination of France in the 1960s.\nMany of his film roles, especially as Michel Poiccard, were regarded as \"legendary\" and highly influential. Despite his reluctance to learn English, many often believed had he accepted offers from Hollywood, his success there would have been comparable to that of French actors Charles Boyer or Maurice Chevalier. In an obituary for \"The Guardian\", they hailed Belmondo as an \"integral part of the history of French cinema, and France itself\". He was described as the \"epitome of cool\".\nAmerican film director Quentin Tarantino cited Belmondo as an influence and called Belmondo \"a verb that represents vitality, charisma, a force of will, it represents super coolness\". English director Edgar Wright said that \"cinema will never be quite as cool again\" following Belmondo's death. He was described as an icon of French cinema and being influential in shaping modern European cinema.\nBelmondo, particularly his role in \"That Man from Rio\", proved highly popular in Japan and influenced the creation of the popular manga and media franchise \"Lupin the Third\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A monk of Monte Cassino and chancellor of Pope Paschal II, Caetani was unanimously elected to succeed him. In doing so, he also inherited the conflict with Emperor Henry V over investiture. Gelasius spent a good part of his brief papacy in exile.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nHe was born between 1060 and 1064 at Gaeta into the Pisan branch of the Caetani family, and he became a monk of Monte Cassino. Pope Urban II, who wished to improve the style of papal documents, brought him to Rome and made Caetani a papal subdeacon (August 1088) and cardinal deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin (probably on 23 September 1088). As chancellor of the Holy Roman Church from 1089 to 1118, he drastically reformed the papal administration, establishing a permanent staff of clerks for the papacy, overcoming the previous custom of relying on Roman notaries to write papal documents, and introducing the minuscule curial script. His tenure also established the precedent of the papal chancellor always being a cardinal and holding the office for life or until elected pope.\nPontificate.\nShortly after his unanimous election to succeed Pope Paschal II in 1118, he was seized by Cencio II Frangipane, a partisan of Emperor Henry V, but was freed by a general uprising of the Romans on his behalf.\nHenry V sought to enforce the privilege of investiture conceded (and later revoked in 1112) by the papacy, under duress, by Paschal II. He drove Gelasius II from Rome in March 1118, pronounced his election null and void, and set up Maurice Bourdin, Archbishop of Braga, as antipope under the name of Gregory VIII.\nGelasius II fled to Gaeta, where he was ordained a priest on 9 March 1118 and on the following day received episcopal consecration. He at once excommunicated Henry V and the antipope and, under Norman protection, was able to return to Rome in July. But the disturbances of the imperialist party, especially those of the Frangipani, who attacked the Pope while celebrating Mass in the church of St. Prassede, compelled Gelasius II to go once more into exile. He set out for France, consecrating the cathedral of Pisa on the way, and arrived at Marseille in October. He was received with great enthusiasm at Avignon, Montpellier and other cities, held a synod at Vienne in January 1119, and was planning to hold a general council to settle the investiture contest when he died at the Abbey of Cluny.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45383", "revid": "10863197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45383", "title": "Ecoregion", "text": "Ecological and geographic area\n \nEcoregions (ecological regions) are ecological and geographic areas that exist on multiple different levels, defined by type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. Ecoregions cover relatively large areas of land or water, and contain characteristic, geographically distinct assemblages of natural communities and species. The biodiversity of flora, fauna and ecosystems that characterise an ecoregion tends to be distinct from that of other ecoregions. In theory, biodiversity or conservation ecoregions are relatively large areas of land or water where the probability of encountering different species and communities at any given point remains relatively constant, within an acceptable range of variation (largely undefined at this point).\nEcoregions are also known as \"ecozones\" (\"ecological zones\"), although that term may also refer to biogeographic realms.\nThree caveats are appropriate for all bio-geographic mapping approaches. Firstly, no single bio-geographic framework is optimal for all taxa. Ecoregions reflect the best compromise for as many taxa as possible. Secondly, ecoregion boundaries rarely form abrupt edges; rather, ecotones and mosaic habitats bound them. Thirdly, most ecoregions contain habitats that differ from their assigned biome. Biogeographic provinces may originate due to various barriers, including physical (plate tectonics, topographic highs), climatic (latitudinal variation, seasonal range) and ocean chemical related (salinity, oxygen levels).\nHistory.\nThe history of the term is somewhat vague. It has been used in many contexts: forest classifications (Loucks, 1962), biome classifications (Bailey, 1976, 2014), biogeographic classifications (WWF/Global 200 scheme of Olson &amp; Dinerstein, 1998), etc.\nThe phrase \"ecological region\" was widely used throughout the 20th century by biologists and zoologists to define specific geographic areas in research. In the early 1970s, the term 'ecoregion' was introduced (short for ecological region), and R.G. Bailey published the first comprehensive map of U.S. ecoregions in 1976. The term was used widely in scholarly literature in the 1980s and 1990s, and in 2001 scientists at the U.S. conservation organization World Wildlife Fund (WWF) codified and published the first global-scale map of Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEOW), led by D. Olsen, E. Dinerstein, E. Wikramanayake, and N. Burgess. While the two approaches are related, the Bailey ecoregions (nested in four levels) give more importance to ecological criteria and climate zones, while the WWF ecoregions give more importance to biogeography, that is, the distribution of distinct species assemblages.\nThe TEOW framework originally delineated 867 terrestrial ecoregions nested into 14 major biomes, contained with the world's 8 major biogeographical realms. Subsequent regional papers by the co-authors covering Africa, Indo-Pacific, and Latin America differentiate between ecoregions and bioregions, referring to the latter as \"geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)\", though the Assessment by Graham defines a bioregion exclusively in the sense of biogeographic history. The specific goal of the authors was to support global biodiversity conservation by providing a \"fourfold increase in resolution over that of the 198 biotic provinces of Dasmann (1974) and the 193 units of Udvardy (1975).\" In 2007, a comparable set of Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW) was published, led by M. Spalding, and in 2008 a set of Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (FEOW) was published, led by R. Abell.\nBailey's ecoregion concept prioritizes ecological criteria and climate, while the WWF concept prioritizes biogeography, that is, the distribution of distinct species assemblages.\nIn 2017, an updated terrestrial ecoregions dataset was released in the paper \"An Ecoregion-Based Approach to Protecting Half the Terrestrial Realm\" led by E. Dinerstein with 48 co-authors. Using recent advances in satellite imagery the ecoregion perimeters were refined and the total number reduced to 846 (and later 844), which can be explored on a web application developed by Resolve and Google Earth Engine.\nDefinition and categorization.\nAn ecoregion is a \"recurring pattern of ecosystems associated with characteristic combinations of soil and landform that characterise that region\". Omernik (2004) elaborates on this by defining ecoregions as: \"areas within which there is spatial coincidence in characteristics of geographical phenomena associated with differences in the quality, health, and integrity of ecosystems\". \"Characteristics of geographical phenomena\" may include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, hydrology, terrestrial and aquatic fauna, and soils, and may or may not include the impacts of human activity (e.g. land use patterns, vegetation changes). There is significant, but not absolute, spatial correlation among these characteristics, making the delineation of ecoregions an imperfect science. Another complication is that environmental conditions across an ecoregion boundary may change very gradually, e.g. the prairie-forest transition in the midwestern United States, making it difficult to identify an exact dividing boundary. Such transition zones are called ecotones.\nEcoregions can be categorized using an algorithmic approach or a holistic, \"weight-of-evidence\" approach where the importance of various factors may vary. An example of the algorithmic approach is Robert Bailey's work for the U.S. Forest Service, which uses a hierarchical classification that first divides land areas into very large regions based on climatic factors, and subdivides these regions, based first on dominant potential vegetation, and then by geomorphology and soil characteristics. The weight-of-evidence approach is exemplified by James Omernik's work for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, subsequently adopted (with modification) for North America by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation.\nThe intended purpose of ecoregion delineation may affect the method used. For example, the WWF ecoregions were developed to aid in biodiversity conservation planning, and place a greater emphasis than the Omernik or Bailey systems on floral and faunal differences between regions. The WWF classification defines an ecoregion as:\nA large area of land or water that contains a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities that:\n(a) Share a large majority of their species and ecological dynamics;\n(b) Share similar environmental conditions, and;\n(c) Interact ecologically in ways that are critical for their long-term persistence.\nAccording to WWF, the boundaries of an ecoregion approximate the original extent of the natural communities prior to any major recent disruptions or changes. WWF has identified 867 terrestrial ecoregions, and approximately 450 freshwater ecoregions across the Earth.\nImportance.\nThe use of the term ecoregion is an outgrowth of a surge of interest in ecosystems and their functioning. In particular, there is awareness of issues relating to spatial scale in the study and management of landscapes. It is widely recognized that interlinked ecosystems combine to form a whole that is \"greater than the sum of its parts\". There are many attempts to respond to ecosystems in an integrated way to achieve \"multi-functional\" landscapes, and various interest groups from agricultural researchers to conservationists are using the \"ecoregion\" as a unit of analysis.\nThe \"Global 200\" is the list of ecoregions identified by WWF as priorities for conservation.\nTerrestrial.\nTerrestrial ecoregions are land ecoregions, as distinct from freshwater and marine ecoregions. In this context, \"terrestrial\" is used to mean \"of land\" (soil and rock), rather than the more general sense \"of Earth\" (which includes land and oceans).\nWWF ecologists currently divide the land surface of the Earth into eight biogeographical realms containing 867 smaller terrestrial ecoregions (see list). The WWF effort is a synthesis of many previous efforts to define and classify ecoregions.\nThe eight realms follow the major floral and faunal boundaries, identified by botanists and zoologists, that separate the world's major plant and animal communities. Realm boundaries generally follow continental boundaries, or major barriers to plant and animal distribution, like the Himalayas and the Sahara. The boundaries of ecoregions are often not as decisive or well recognized, and are subject to greater disagreement.\nEcoregions are classified by biome type, which are the major global plant communities determined by rainfall and climate. Forests, grasslands (including savanna and shrubland), and deserts (including xeric shrublands) are distinguished by climate (tropical and subtropical vs. temperate and boreal climates) and, for forests, by whether the trees are predominantly conifers (gymnosperms), or whether they are predominantly broadleaf (Angiosperms) and mixed (broadleaf and conifer). Biome types like Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub; tundra; and mangroves host very distinct ecological communities, and are recognised as distinct biome types as well.\nMarine.\nMarine ecoregions are defined by \"BioScience\" as \"Areas of relatively homogeneous species composition, clearly distinct from adjacent systems ... In ecological terms, these are strongly cohesive units, sufficiently large to encompass ecological or life history processes for most sedentary species.\" They have been defined by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and WWF to aid in conservation activities for marine ecosystems. Forty-three priority marine ecoregions were delineated as part of WWF's Global 200 efforts. The scheme used to designate and classify marine ecoregions is analogous to that used for terrestrial ecoregions. Major habitat types are identified: polar, temperate shelves and seas, temperate upwelling, tropical upwelling, tropical coral, pelagic (trades and westerlies), abyssal, and hadal (ocean trench). These correspond to the terrestrial biomes.\nThe Global 200 classification of marine ecoregions is not developed to the same level of detail and comprehensiveness as that of the terrestrial ecoregions; only the priority conservation areas are listed.\nSee Global 200 Marine ecoregions for a full list of marine ecoregions.\nIn 2007, TNC and WWF refined and expanded this scheme to provide a system of comprehensive near shore (to 200 meters depth) Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW). The 232 individual marine ecoregions are grouped into 62 marine provinces, which in turn group into 12 marine realms, which represent the broad latitudinal divisions of polar, temperate, and tropical seas, with subdivisions based on ocean basins (except for the southern hemisphere temperate oceans, which are based on continents).\nMajor marine biogeographic realms, analogous to the eight terrestrial biogeographic realms, represent large regions of the ocean basins: Arctic, Temperate Northern Atlantic, Temperate Northern Pacific, Tropical Atlantic, Western Indo-Pacific, Central Indo-Pacific, Eastern Indo-Pacific, Tropical Eastern Pacific, Temperate South America, Temperate Southern Africa, Temperate Australasia, and Southern Ocean.\nA similar system of identifying areas of the oceans for conservation purposes is the system of large marine ecosystems (LMEs), developed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nFreshwater.\nA freshwater ecoregion is a large area encompassing one or more freshwater systems that contains a distinct assemblage of natural freshwater communities and species. The freshwater species, dynamics, and environmental conditions within a given ecoregion are more similar to each other than to those of surrounding ecoregions and together form a conservation unit. Freshwater systems include rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. Freshwater ecoregions are distinct from terrestrial ecoregions, which identify biotic communities of the land, and marine ecoregions, which are biotic communities of the oceans.\nA map of Freshwater Ecoregions of the World, released in 2008, has 426 ecoregions covering virtually the entire non-marine surface of the earth.\nThe WWF identifies 12 major habitat types of freshwater ecoregions: Large lakes, large river deltas, polar freshwaters, montane freshwaters, temperate coastal rivers, temperate floodplain rivers and wetlands, temperate upland rivers, tropical and subtropical coastal rivers, tropical and subtropical floodplain rivers and wetlands, tropical and subtropical upland rivers, xeric freshwaters and endorheic basins, and oceanic islands. The freshwater major habitat types reflect groupings of ecoregions with similar biological, chemical, and physical characteristics and are roughly equivalent to biomes for terrestrial systems.\nThe Global 200, a set of ecoregions identified by WWF whose conservation would achieve the goal of saving a broad diversity of the Earth's ecosystems, includes a number of areas highlighted for their freshwater biodiversity values. The Global 200 preceded Freshwater Ecoregions of the World and incorporated information from regional freshwater ecoregional assessments that had been completed at that time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nSources related to the WWC scheme:\nOthers:"}
{"id": "45386", "revid": "50744742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45386", "title": "Sardis", "text": "Ancient city in Turkey\nSardis ( ) or Sardes ( ; ; ; ) was an ancient city best known as the capital of the Lydian Empire. After the fall of the Lydian Empire, it became the capital of the Persian satrapy of Lydia and later a major center of Hellenistic and Byzantine culture. Now an active archaeological site, it is located in modern day Turkey, in Manisa Province, near the town of Sart.\nIn 2025, Sardis was listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nHistory.\nSardis was occupied for at least 3500 years. In that time, it fluctuated between a wealthy city of international importance and a collection of modest hamlets.\nFoundation stories.\nHerodotus recounts a legend that the city was founded by the sons of Heracles, the Heracleidae. According to Herodotus, the Heraclides ruled for five hundred and five years beginning with Agron, 1220 BC, and ending with Candaules, 716 BC. They were followed by the Mermnades, which began with Gyges, 716 BC, and ended with Croesus, 546 BC.\nThe name \"Sardis\" appears first in the work of the Archaic era poet Sappho. Strabo claims that the city's original name was \"Hyde\".\nEarly settlement.\nSardis was settled before 1500 BC. However, the size and nature of early settlement is not known since only small extramural portions of these layers have been excavated. Evidence of occupation consists largely of Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age pottery which shows affinities with Mycenaean Greece and the Hittites. No early monumental architecture had been found as of 2011.\nThe site may have been occupied as early as the Neolithic, as evidenced by scattered finds of early ceramic fragments. However, these were found out of context, so no clear conclusions can be drawn. Early Bronze Age cemeteries were found 7 miles away along Lake Marmara, near elite graves of the later Lydian and Persian periods.(p1116)\nIn the Late Bronze Age, the site would have been in the territory of the Seha River Land, whose capital is thought to have been located at nearby Kaymak\u00e7\u0131. Hittite texts record that Seha was originally part of Arzawa, a macrokingdom which the Hittite king Mursili II defeated and partitioned. After that time, Seha became a vassal state of the Hittites and served as an important intermediary with the Mycenaean Greeks. The relationship between the people of Seha and the later Lydians is unclear, since there is evidence of both cultural continuity and disruption in the region. Neither the term \"Sardis\" nor its alleged earlier name of \"Hyde\" (in Ancient Greek, which may have reflected a Hittite name \"Uda\") appears in any extant Hittite text.\nLydian Period.\nIn the seventh century BC, Sardis became the capital city of Lydia. From there, kings such as Croesus ruled an empire that reached as far as the Halys River in the east. The city itself covered 108 hectares including extramural areas and was protected by walls twenty meters thick. The acropolis was terraced with white ashlar masonry to tame the naturally irregular mountainside. Visitors could spot the site from a distance by the three enormous burial tumuli at Bin Tepe.\nThe city's layout and organization is only partly known at present. To the north/northwest, the city had a large extramural zone with residential, commercial, and industrial areas. Settlement extended to the Pactolus Stream, near which archaeologists have found the remains of work installations where alluvial metals were processed.(p1117)\nMultiroom houses around the site match Herodotus's description of fieldstone and mudbrick construction. Most houses had roofs of clay and straw while wealthy residents had roof tiles, similar to public buildings. Houses often have identifiable courtyards and food preparation areas but no complete house has been excavated so few generalizations can be drawn about Sardian houses' internal layout.\nReligious remains include a modest altar which may have been dedicated to Cybele, given a pottery fragment found there with her name on it.(p1118) A possible sanctuary to Artemis was found elsewhere in the site, whose remains include marble statues of lions.(p1117) Vernacular worship is evidenced in extramural areas by dinner services buried as offerings.(p1117)\nTextual evidence regarding Lydian-era Sardis include Pliny's account of a mudbrick building that had allegedly been the palace of Croesus and was still there in his own time.(p1117)\nThe material culture of Sardis is largely a distinctive twist on Anatolian and Aegean styles. The city's artisans seemed to specialize in glyptic art including seals and jewelry. Their pottery blended Aegean and Anatolian pottery styles, in addition to distinctive twists which included the \"lydion\" shape and decorative techniques known as streaky-glaze and marbled-glaze. Narrative scenes on Sardian pottery are rare. Imported Greek pottery attests to the Lydians' \"Hellenophile attitude\" commented on by contemporary Greek writers. While those Greek authors were in turn impressed by Lydians' music and textiles, these aspects of Lydian culture are not visible in the archaeological record.(p1124)\nDestruction by Cyrus the Great.\nSardis was conquered by Cyrus the Great around 547 BC. Having defeated the Lydian king Croesus at the Battle of Pteria and Battle of Thymbra, the Persians followed the retreating army back to Sardis and sacked it after a brief siege.\n Details of this event are largely known from Herodotus's semi-mythicized account, but the destruction is highly visible in the archaeological record. In the words of excavator Nicholas Cahill:\nIt is rare that an important and well-known historical event is so vividly preserved in the archaeological record, but the destruction of Cyrus left clear and dramatic remains throughout the city.\nThe city's fortifications burned in a massive fire that spread to parts of the adjoining residential areas. Wooden structures and objects inside buildings were reduced to charcoal. Mudbrick from the fortifications were toppled over on adjacent structures, preventing looting and salvage and thus preserving their remains.\nSkeletons were found buried haphazardly among the debris, including those of Lydian soldiers who died violently. One soldier's forearm bones had been snapped, likely a \"parry fracture\" indicating a failed attempt to counter the head injuries that killed him. A partly healed rib fracture suggests he was still recovering from an earlier injury during the battle. In a destroyed house, archaeologists found the partial skeleton of an arthritic man in his forties. The skeleton was so badly burned that archaeologists cannot determine whether it was deliberately mutilated or if the missing bones were carried away by animals.\nArrowheads and other weaponry turn up in debris all around the city, suggesting a major battle in the streets. The varying styles suggest the mixed background of both armies involved. Household implements such as iron spits and small sickles were found mixed in with ordinary weapons of war, suggesting that civilians attempted to defend themselves during the sack.\nPersian Period.\nAfter the destruction, Sardis was rebuilt and continued to be an important and prosperous city. Though it was never again the capital of an independent state, it did serve as the capital for the satrapy of Sparda and formed the end station of the Persian Royal Road which began in Persepolis. It acted as a gateway to the Greek world, and was visited by notable Greek leaders such as Lysander and Alcibiades, as well as the Persian kings Darius I and Xerxes.\nRelatively little of Persian Sardis is visible in the archaeological record. The city may even have been rebuilt outside the limits of the Lydian-era walls, as evidenced by authors such as Herodotus who place the Persian era central district along the Pactolus stream. The material culture of the city was largely continuous with the Lydian era, to the point that it can be hard to precisely date artifacts based on style.\nNotable developments of this period include adoption of the Aramaic alphabet alongside the Lydian alphabet and the \"Achaemenid bowl\" pottery shape. Jewelry of the period shows Persian-Anatolian cultural hybridization. In particular, jewelers turned to semi-precious stones and colored frit due to a Persian prohibition on gold jewelry among the priestly class. Similarly, knobbed pins and fibulae disappear from the archaeological record, reflecting changes in the garments with which they would have been used.\nBuildings from this era include a possible predecessor of the later temple to Artemis as well as a possible sanctuary of Zeus. Textual evidence suggests that the city was known for its paradisoi as well as orchards and hunting parks built by Tissaphernes and Cyrus the Younger(p1122) Burials of this period include enormous tumuli with extensive grave goods.\nIn 499 BC, Sardis was attacked and burned by the Ionians as part of the Ionian Revolt against Persian rule. The subsequent destruction of mainland Greek cities was said to be retribution for this attack. When Themistocles later visited Sardis, he came across a votive statue he had personally dedicated at Athens, and requested its return.\nHellenistic and Byzantine Sardis.\nIn 334 BC, Sardis was conquered by Alexander the Great. The city was surrendered without a fight, the local satrap having been killed during the Persian defeat at Granikos. After taking power, Alexander restored earlier Lydian customs and laws. For the next two centuries, the city passed between Hellenistic rulers including Antigonus Monophthalmos, Lysimachus, the Seleucids, and the Attalids. It was besieged by Seleucus I in 281 BC and by Antiochus III in 215\u2013213 BC, but neither succeeded at breaching the acropolis, regarded as the strongest fortified place in the world. The city sometimes served as a royal residence, but was itself governed by an assembly.(p1123)\nIn this era, the city took on a strong Greek character. The Greek language replaces the Lydian language in most inscriptions, and major buildings were constructed in Greek architectural styles to meet the needs of Greek cultural institutions. These new buildings included a prytaneion, gymnasion, theater, hippodrome, as well as the massive Temple of Artemis still visible to modern visitors. Jews were settled at Sardis by the Hellenistic king Antiochos III, where they built the Sardis Synagogue and formed a community which continued for much of late antiquity.(p1123)\nIn 129 BC, Sardis passed to the Romans, under whom it continued its prosperity and political importance as part of the province of Asia. The city received three neocorate honors and was granted ten\u00a0million sesterces as well as a temporary tax exemption to help it recover after a devastating earthquake in 17 AD.(p1123) Sardis had an early Christian community and is one of the seven churches of Asia. \nLater, trade and the organization of commerce continued to be sources of great wealth. After Constantinople became the capital of the East, a new road system grew up connecting the provinces with the capital. Sardis then lay rather apart from the great lines of communication and lost some of its importance.\nDuring the cataclysmic 7th-century Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War, Sardis was in 615 one of the cities sacked in the invasion of Asia Minor by the Persian Shahin. Though the Byzantines eventually won the war, the damage to Sardis was never fully repaired.\nSardis retained its titular supremacy and continued to be the seat of the metropolitan bishop of the province of Lydia, formed in 295\u00a0AD. It was enumerated as third, after Ephesus and Smyrna, in the list of cities of the Thracesion thema given by Constantine Porphyrogenitus in the 10th\u00a0century. However, over the next four centuries it was in the shadow of the provinces of Magnesia-upon-Sipylum and Philadelphia, which retained their importance in the region.\nLater history.\nSardis began to decline in the 600s AD.(p1123) It remained part of the Byzantine Empire until 1078 AD, by the Seljuk Turks. It was reconquered in 1097 by the Byzantine general John Doukas and came under the rule of the Byzantine Empire of Nicaea when Constantinople was taken by the Venetians and crusaders in 1204. However, once the Byzantines retook Constantinople in 1261, Sardis and surrounding areas fell under the control of Ghazw emirs. The Cayster valleys and a fort on the citadel of Sardis were handed over to them by treaty in 1306. The city continued its decline until its capture and probable destruction by the Turco-Mongol warlord Timur in 1402.\nBy the 1700s, only two small hamlets existed at the site. In the 20th century, a new town was built.\nIn 2025, Sardis was enlisted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, for its significance as the home of coinage.\nGeography.\nSardis was situated in the middle of Hermus River Valley, about south of the river. Its citadel was built on Mount Tmolus, a steep and lofty spur, while a lower town extended to the area of the Pactolus stream.\nToday, the site is located by the present day village of \"Sart\", near Salihli in the Manisa province of Turkey, close to the Ankara - \u0130zmir highway (approximately from \u0130zmir). The site is open to visitors year-round, where notable remains include the bath-gymnasium complex, synagogue and Byzantine shops is open to visitors year-round.\nExcavation history.\nBy the 19th\u00a0century, Sardis was in ruins, with mainly visible remains mostly from the Roman period. Early excavators included the British explorer George Dennis, who uncovered an enormous marble head of Faustina the Elder. Found in the precinct of the Temple of Artemis, it probably formed part of a pair of colossal statues devoted to the Imperial couple. The 1.76\u00a0metre high head is now kept at the British Museum.\nThe first large-scale archaeological expedition in Sardis was directed by a Princeton University team led by Howard Crosby Butler between years 1910\u20131914, unearthing a temple to Artemis, and more than a thousand Lydian tombs. The excavation campaign was halted by World War I, followed by the Turkish War of Independence, though it briefly resumed in 1922. Some surviving artifacts from the Butler excavation were added to the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\nA new expedition known as the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis was founded in 1958 by G.M.A. Hanfmann, professor in the Department of Fine Arts at Harvard University, and by Henry Detweiler, dean of the Architecture School at Cornell University. Hanfmann excavated widely in the city and the region, excavating and restoring the major Roman bath-gymnasium complex, the synagogue, late Roman houses and shops, a Lydian industrial area for processing electrum into pure gold and silver, Lydian occupation areas, and tumulus tombs at Bintepe.\nDuring the 1960s, the acknowledgment of the local significance of the Jewish community in Sardis received notable confirmation through the identification of a substantial assembly hall in the northwestern part of the city, now known as the Sardis Synagogue. This site, adorned with inscriptions, menorahs, and various artifacts, establishes its function as a synagogue from the 4th to the 6th century. Excavations in adjacent residential and commercial areas have also uncovered additional evidence of Jewish life.\nFrom 1976 until 2007, excavation continued under Crawford H. Greenewalt, Jr., professor in the Department of Classics at the University of California, Berkeley. Since 2008, the excavation has been under the directorship of Nicholas Cahill, professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most Polish literature has been written in the Polish language, though other languages used in Poland over the centuries have also contributed to Polish literary traditions, including Latin, Yiddish, Lithuanian, Russian, German and Esperanto. According to Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, for centuries Polish literature focused more on drama and poetic self-expression than on fiction (dominant in the English speaking world). The reasons were manifold but mostly rested on the historical circumstances of the nation. Polish writers typically have had a more profound range of choices to motivate them to write, including past cataclysms of extraordinary violence that swept Poland (as the crossroads of Europe), but also, Poland's collective incongruities demanding an adequate reaction from the writing communities of any given period.\nThe period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s\u201340s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century. Leading Polish Enlightenment authors included Ignacy Krasicki (1735\u20131801) and Jan Potocki (1761\u20131815). Polish Romanticism, unlike Romanticism elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation. Early Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics. Notable writers included Adam Mickiewicz, Seweryn Goszczy\u0144ski, Tomasz Zan and Maurycy Mochnacki.\nIn the second period, many Polish Romantics worked abroad. Influential poets included Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz S\u0142owacki and Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski.\nIn the aftermath of the failed January uprising, the new period of Polish Positivism began to advocate skepticism and the exercise of reason. The modernist period known as the Young Poland movement in visual arts, literature and music, came into being around 1890, and concluded with the Poland's return to independence (1918). Notable authors included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski and Jan Kasprowicz. The neo-Romantic era was exemplified by the works of Stefan \u017beromski, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont, Gabriela Zapolska, and Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski. In 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz received a Nobel Prize in literature for his \"Quo Vadis\" inspiring a new sense of hope. Literature of the Second Polish Republic (1918\u20131939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland's return to independence. New avant-garde writers included Julian Tuwim, Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz, Witold Gombrowicz, Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, Maria D\u0105browska and Zofia Na\u0142kowska.\nIn the World War II years of German and Soviet occupation of Poland, all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. Out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland, about 200 were devoted to literature.\nMuch of Polish literature written during the Occupation of Poland appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II, including books by Na\u0142kowska, Rudnicki, Borowski and others. The situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949\u20131950 with the introduction of the Stalinist doctrine by the Minister of Culture and Art W\u0142odzimierz Sokorski. Poland had three Nobel Prize winning authors in the later 20th century: Isaac Bashevis Singer (1978), Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz (1980) and Wis\u0142awa Szymborska (1996). In the early 21st century, yet another writer was awarded the Prize: Olga Tokarczuk (2018).\nMiddle Ages.\nAlmost nothing remains of Polish literature prior to the country's Christianization in 966. Poland's pagan inhabitants certainly possessed an oral literature extending to Slavic songs, legends and beliefs, but early Christian writers did not deem it worthy of mention in the obligatory Latin, and so it has perished.\nWithin the Polish literary tradition, it is customary to include works that have dealt with Poland, even if not written by ethnic Poles. This is the case with Gallus Anonymus, the first historian to have described Poland in his work entitled \"Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum\" (Deeds of the Princes of the Poles), composed in sophisticated Latin. Gallus was a foreign monk who accompanied King Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth in his return from Hungary to Poland. The important tradition of Polish historiography was continued by Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek, a thirteenth-century Bishop of Krak\u00f3w, as well as Jan D\u0142ugosz, a Polish priest and secretary to Bishop Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki.\nThe first recorded sentence in the Polish language reads: \"Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai\" (\"Let me grind, and you take a rest\") \u2013 a paraphrase of the Latin \"Sine, ut ego etiam molam.\" The work in which this phrase appeared reflects the culture of early Poland. The sentence was written within the Latin language chronicle \"Liber fundationis\" from between 1269 and 1273, a history of the Cistercian monastery in Henryk\u00f3w, Silesia. It was recorded by an abbot known simply as Piotr (Peter), referring to an event almost a hundred years earlier. The sentence was supposedly uttered by a Bohemian settler, Bogwal (\"Bogwalus Boemus\"), a subject of Boles\u0142aw the Tall, expressing compassion for his own wife who \"very often stood grinding by the quern-stone.\" Most notable early medieval Polish works in Latin and the Old Polish language include the oldest extant manuscript of fine prose in the Polish language entitled the \"Holy Cross Sermons\", as well as the earliest Polish-language \"Bible of Queen Zofia\" and the \"Chronicle of Janko of Czarnk\u00f3w\" from the 14th century, not to mention the \"Pu\u0142awy Psalter\".\nMost early texts in Polish vernacular were influenced heavily by the Latin sacred literature. They include \"Bogurodzica\" (Mother of God), a hymn in praise of the Virgin Mary written down in the 15th century, although popular at least a century earlier. \"Bogurodzica\" served as a national anthem. It was one of the first texts reproduced in Polish on a printing press; and so was the \"Master Polikarp's Conversation with Death\" (Rozmowa mistrza Polikarpa ze \u015bmierci\u0105). At that time several Catholic Marian songs were written, with many of them being considered the most notable art pieces of the Medieval polish literature, including \"Lament of the Holy Cross\" that presents Mary in more humane and emotional way. Also, various hagiographic legends were created and Legenda o \u015bwi\u0119tym Aleksym (The Legend of the Saint Alexius) is considered the most prominent. The legend treats about the figure of the Saint Alexius that chose the path of lifelong asceticism as a sacrifice of worldly goods in the name of God.\nIn the early 1470s, one of the first printing houses in Poland was set up by Kasper Straube in Krak\u00f3w (see: spread of the printing press). In 1475 Kasper Elyan of G\u0142og\u00f3w (Glogau) set up a printing shop in Wroc\u0142aw (Breslau), Silesia. Twenty years later, the first Cyrillic printing house was founded at Krak\u00f3w by Schweipolt Fiol for Eastern Orthodox Church hierarchs. The most notable texts produced in that period include \"Saint Florian's Breviary,\" printed partially in Polish in the late 14th century; \"Statua synodalia Wratislaviensia\" (1475): a printed collection of Polish and Latin prayers; as well as Jan D\u0142ugosz's \"Chronicle\" from the 15th century and his \"Catalogus archiepiscoporum Gnesnensium\".\nRenaissance.\nWith the advent of the Renaissance, the Polish language was finally accepted on an equal footing with Latin. Polish culture and art flourished under Jagiellonian rule, and many foreign poets and writers settled in Poland, bringing with them new literary trends. Such writers included Kallimach (Filippo Buonaccorsi) and Conrad Celtis. Many Polish writers studied abroad, and at the Krak\u00f3w Academy, which became a melting pot for new ideas and currents. In 1488, the world's first literary society, the \"Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana\" (Vistula Literary Society) was founded in Krak\u00f3w. Notable members included Conrad Celtes, Albert Brudzewski, Filip Callimachus and Laurentius Corvinus.\nA Polish writer who used Latin as his principal vehicle of expression was Klemens Janicki (\"Ianicius\"), who became one of the most notable Latin poets of his time and was laureled by the Pope. Other writers such as Miko\u0142aj Rej, and Jan Kochanowski, laid the foundations for the Polish literary language and modern Polish grammar. The first book written entirely in the Polish language appeared in this period \u2013 It was a prayer-book by Biernat of Lublin (c. 1465 \u2013 after 1529) called \"Raj duszny\" (\"Hortulus Animae\", Eden of the Soul), printed in Krak\u00f3w in 1513 at one of Poland's first printing establishments, operated by Florian Ungler (originally from Bavaria). The most notable Polish writers and poets active in the 16th century include:\nBaroque.\nThe literature in the period of Polish Baroque (between 1620 and 1764) was significantly influenced by the great popularization of Jesuit high schools, which offered education based on Latin classics as part of a preparation for a political career. The studies of poetry required the practical knowledge of writing both Latin and Polish poems, which radically increased the number of poets and versifiers countrywide. On the soil of humanistic education some exceptional writers grew as well: Piotr Kochanowski (1566\u20131620) gave his translation of Torquato Tasso's \"Jerusalem Delivered\"; Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, a poet laureate, became known among European nations as \"Horatius christianus \" (Christian Horace) for his Latin writings; Jan Andrzej Morsztyn (1621\u20131693), an epicurean courtier and diplomat, extolled in his sophisticated poems the valors of earthly delights; and Wac\u0142aw Potocki (1621\u20131696), the most productive writer of the Polish Baroque, unified the typical opinions of Polish szlachta with some deeper reflections and existential experiences. Notable Polish writers and poets active in this period include:\nEnlightenment.\nThe period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s\u201340s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century during the reign of Poland's last king, Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski. It went into sharp decline with the Third and final Partition of Poland (1795), followed by political, cultural and economic destruction of the country, and leading to the Great Emigration of Polish elites. The Enlightenment ended around 1822, and was replaced by Polish Romanticism at home and abroad.\nOne of the leading Polish Enlightenment poets was Ignacy Krasicki (1735\u20131801), known locally as \"the Prince of Poets\" and Poland's La Fontaine, author of the first Polish novel called \"The Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom\" (Miko\u0142aja Do\u015bwiadczy\u0144skiego przypadki); he was also a playwright, journalist, encyclopedist and translator from French and Greek. Another prominent writer of the period was Jan Potocki (1761\u20131815), a Polish nobleman, Egyptologist, linguist, and adventurer, whose travel memoirs made him legendary in his homeland. Outside Poland he is known chiefly for his novel, \"The Manuscript Found in Saragossa,\" which has drawn comparisons to such celebrated works as the \"Decameron\" and \"the Arabian Nights\".\nNotable Polish writers and poets of the Enlightenment period include:\nRomanticism.\nDue to partitions carried out by the neighboring empires \u2013 which ended the existence of the sovereign Polish state in 1795 \u2013 Polish Romanticism, unlike Romanticism elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation, and expressed the ideals and the traditional way of life of the Polish people. The period of Romanticism in Poland ended with the Tsarist suppression of the January 1863 Uprising, marked by public executions by the Russians and deportations to Siberia.\nThe literature of Polish Romanticism falls into two distinct periods, both defined by insurgencies: the first around 1820\u20131830, ending with the November uprising of 1830; and the second between 1830 and 1864, giving birth to Polish Positivism. In the first period, Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics \u2013 Their art featured emotionalism and imagination, folklore, country life, as well as the propagation of the ideals of independence. The most famous writers of the period were: Adam Mickiewicz, Seweryn Goszczy\u0144ski, Tomasz Zan and Maurycy Mochnacki. In the second period (after the January uprising), many Polish Romantics worked abroad, often banished from the Polish soil by the occupying power. Their work became dominated by the ideals of freedom and the struggle for regaining their country's lost sovereignty. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. Also in that period, the idea of the \"poeta-wieszcz\" (nation's bard) developed. The \"wieszcz\" functioned as spiritual leader to the suppressed people. The most notable poet among the \"leading bards of Romanticism, so recognized in both periods, was Adam Mickiewicz. Other two national poets were: Juliusz S\u0142owacki and Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski. Polish writers and poets of the Romantic period include:\nPositivism.\nIn the aftermath of the failed January 1863 Uprising against Russian occupation, the new period of Polish Positivism\u2014which took its name from Auguste Comte's philosophy of Positivism\u2014advocated skepticism and the exercise of reason. Questions addressed by Poland's Positivist writers revolved around \"organic work,\" which included the establishment of equal rights for all members of society, including feminists; the assimilation of Poland's Jewish minority; and the defense of the Polish population in the German-ruled part of Poland against \"Kulturkampf\" Germanization and the displacement of the Polish population by German settlers. The writers worked to educate the public about constructive patriotism, which would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated \"social organism\", regardless of adverse circumstances. Poland's Positivist period lasted until the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the Young Poland movement.\nHenryk Sienkiewicz.\nSeveral positivistic Polish writers' work was considered pivotal for the progress of Polish literature. Among them, Henryk Sienkiewicz received the greatest critical acclaim by being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature as the first Polish writer. At first, he was appreciated for his journalism work. Next, he started to publish novellas that were widely admired, including \"Orso\" (a novella about a half-Indian and his partner who work together in a circus and are being physically abused by a circus owner), \"Bartek the Conqueror\" (a story of a Polish peasant that is forced to join Prussian army), \"Janko the Musician\" (a novella about a sickly boy who is exceptionally talented in music which frightens villagers), \"The Lighhouse Keeper\" (a deeply emotional novella treating about nostalgia and loneliness), \"From the Diary of a Pozna\u0144 Teacher\" (a novella that criticizes prussian education system that polish people were forced into), and \"Sachem\" (a story about town in America that was built on the ruin of former Indian hamlet).\nSienkiewicz's novellas were successful and popular, however they were completely overstrided by his novels' excellence. In 1884, 1886, and 1888, he released three volumes of his Trilogy: \"With Fire and Sword\" (Ogniem i Mieczem), \"The Deluge\" (Potop), and \"Pan Michael\" (Pan Wo\u0142odyjowski), respectively. The books were written \"to lift up the heart\" of the Polish nation during the era of the partitions and because of that the epic plot and heroic actions were favored over historical accuracy. Yet, Sienkiewicz tried to preserve the historical context of the books by using the archaic language. The novels also served as descriptions of potential causes of Poland's fall. Having risen to international fame, Sienkiewicz continued to publish novels embedded in historical context. First, in 1896 he published Quo Vadis about ancient Rome under the rule of emperor Nero. The book was written in an extensively detailed way to depict the Roman Empire accurately. Next, he decided to reflect again on Poland's most magnificent historic victories and released The \"Knights of the Cross\" (Krzy\u017cacy) in 1900. The novel portrays medieval life in Poland, depicting the ongoing customs of life, and centers its plot on defeating the German Order of the Teutonic Knights. 5 years later, he won a Nobel Prize for his accomplishments (not for a single book) and dedicated his recognition to being a citizen of Poland, which at the time did not exist.\nBoles\u0142aw Prus.\nAnother prominent figure of Polish Positivism was Boles\u0142aw Prus. He debuted as a journalist, but soon he started publishing novellas. Their main motif was simple people who were emotionally hurt. Just as in \"The Barrel Organ\" (1880) Prus portrays a retired lawyer who excelled at his job and became a professional, yet, he suffers from the lack of a lifetime partner. The author symbolically uses the barrel organ as a means of uniting the lawyer with his new neighbors. Prus also published several novels that were the most representative literature pieces of positivistic philosophy. He wrote books like \"The Doll\" or \"The Outpost\", which presented complex psychological portraits of the characters, encompassed several naturalistic descriptions of life in 19th-century Polish cities, and disseminated concepts of social equality, feminism, and work ideology. Especially, the novel \"The Doll\" became one of the most significant books of Polish literature. Prus depicted 19th-century Warsaw in an extensively detailed way, including thorough descriptions of the architecture, real-life events, social life, and customs, where Polish citizens lived along with Jews. The writer delves into not only the lives of aristocrats and upper-class citizens but also attempts to present the lives of poor and homeless people. Each character of the novel, despite their social class origin, is scrupulously portrayed. The author tries to convey multifaceted aspects of the life of each character, often ambiguously presenting them. By doing this, he preserves the realistic approach that dominated the literature of that time.\nProminent writers and poets of Polish Positivism included:\nYoung Poland (1890\u20131918).\nThe modernist period known as the Young Poland movement in visual arts, literature and music, came into being around 1890, and concluded with the Poland's return to independence (1918). The period was based on two concepts. Its early stage was characterized by a strong aesthetic opposition to the ideals of its own predecessor (promoting \"organic work\" in the face of foreign occupation). Artists following this early philosophy of Young Poland believed in decadence, symbolism, conflict between human values and civilization, and the existence of art for art's sake. Prominent authors who followed this trend included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski and Jan Kasprowicz. The later ideology emerged in conjunction with the socio-political upheavals across Europe such as the 1905 Revolution against Nicholas II of Russia, the Norwegian independence, the Moroccan Crisis and others. It was a continuation of romanticism, often called neo-romanticism. The artists and writers following this idea covered a large variety of topics: from the sense of personal mission of a Pole exemplified by Stefan \u017beromski's prose, through condemnation of social inequality in works by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont and Gabriela Zapolska, to criticism of Polish society and Polish revolutionary history by Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski. In 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz received a Nobel Prize in literature for his patriotic Trilogy inspiring a new sense of hope. Writers of this period include:\nInterbellum (1918\u201339).\nLiterature of the Second Polish Republic (1918\u20131939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland's return to independence. In large part, derivative of these changes was the collective and unobstructed development of programs for artists and writers. New avant-garde trends had emerged. The period, spanning just twenty years, was full of notable individualities who saw themselves as exponents of changing European civilization, including Tuwim, Witkacy, Gombrowicz, Mi\u0142osz, D\u0105browska and Na\u0142kowska (PAL). They all contributed to a new model of the twentieth-century Polish culture echoing its own language of everyday life.\nThe two decades of Interbellum were marked by rapid development in the field of poetry, undivided and undiminished for the first time in over a century. From 1918 to 1939, the gradual and successive introduction of new ideas resulted in the formation of separate and distinct trends. The first decade of Polish interwar poetry was clear, constructive, and optimistic; as opposed to the second decade marked by dark visions of the impending war, internal conflicts within the Polish society, and growing pessimism. The whole period was amazingly rich nevertheless. In 1933 the Polish Academy of Literature (PAL) was founded by a decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic (Rada Ministr\u00f3w RP); as the highest opinion-forming authority in the country; it awarded Gold and the Silver Laurels (Z\u0142oty, and Srebrny Wawrzyn), the two highest national honors for contributions to literature until invasion of Poland in 1939. One of the most prominent poets of the interwar period was Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian (member of PAL), whose creative personality developed before 1918, and in large part influenced both Interbellum decades (until his death in 1937). The literary life of his contemporaries revolved mostly around the issues of independence. All Polish poets treated the concept of freedom with extreme seriousness, and many patriotic works had emerged at that time, not to mention a particular variant of a poetic cult of Pi\u0142sudski.\nWorld War II.\nIn the years of German and Soviet occupation of Poland, all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. The environment was chaotic, and the writers scattered: some found themselves in concentration and labor camps (or Nazi-era ghettos), others were deported out of the country; some emigrated (Tuwim, Wierzy\u0144ski), many more joined the ranks of the Polish underground resistance movement (Baczy\u0144ski, Borowski, Gajcy). All literary outlets were forced to cease operation. Writers who remained at home began organizing literary life in conspiracy, including lectures, evenings of poetry, and secret meetings in the homes of writers and art facilitators. Polish cities where such meetings were held most frequently were: Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w and Lw\u00f3w. Writers participated in setting-up of the underground presses (out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland, about 200 were devoted to literature). Many fought in the Polish army in exile or resisted the Holocaust in a civil capacity. The generation of the \"Kolumbs,\" born around 1920, were active during the Warsaw uprising. Best-known representatives of the war years are:\n1945\u201356.\nAll texts published under Soviet rules were strictly censored.\nMuch of Polish literature written during the Occupation of Poland appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II, including books by Na\u0142kowska, Rudnicki, Borowski and others. The Soviet takeover of the country did not discourage \u00c9migr\u00e9s and exiles from returning, especially before the advent of Stalinism. Indeed, many writers attempted to recreate the Polish literary scene, often with a touch of nostalgia for the prewar reality, including Jerzy Andrzejewski, author of \"Ashes and Diamonds\", describing (according to Communist design) Anti-communist resistance in Poland. His novel was adapted into film a decade later by Wajda. The new emerging prose writers such as Stanis\u0142aw Dygat and Stefan Kisielewski approached the catastrophe of war from their own perspective. Kazimierz Wyka coined a term \"borderline novel\" for documentary fiction.\nThe situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949\u20131950 with the introduction of the Stalinist doctrine by minister Sokorski, on behalf of the increasingly violent Communist regime, which engaged in gross violations of human rights. In the years 1944\u20131956, around 300,000 Polish citizens were arrested, of whom many thousands were sentenced to long-term imprisonment. There were 6,000 death sentences pronounced against political prisoners, the majority of them carried out \"in the majesty of the law\". Fearing for their proper jobs, many writers associated with the Borejsza's publishing empire embraced the Sovietization of Polish culture. In 1953 the ZLP Union, run by Kruczkowski with a slew of prominent signatories, declared full support to persecution of religious leaders by the Ministry of Public Security. Death sentences were not enforced, although Father Fudali died in unexplained circumstances, as had 37 other priest and 54 friars already before 1953. Likewise, writer Kazimierz Moczarski from Armia Krajowa (the Home Army), tortured in jail by Romkowski's subordinates for several years and sentenced to death, was pardoned and released only at the end of this period.\n1956\u20131989.\nDespite censorship and political pressure that forced many writers to publish underground or abroad, this era saw the dawning of a new golden era in Polish literature. Particularly in poetry with several influential poets of international fame such as Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz and Wis\u0142awa Szymborska, who were both awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, Tadeusz R\u00f3\u017cewicz and Zbigniew Herbert. Absurdist dramatist S\u0142awomir Mro\u017cek was a leading name in the international development of avant-garde theatre. Journalist and author Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski was prominent and highly influential in the genre of reportage.\nOther writers include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Rindt won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in with Lotus, and remains the only driver to have won the World Drivers' Championship posthumously, following his death at the Italian Grand Prix; he won six Grands Prix across seven seasons. In endurance racing, Rindt won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1965 with NART.\nBorn in Germany and raised in Austria, Rindt started motor racing in 1961. Switching to single-seaters in 1963, he was successful in both Formula Junior and Formula Two. In , Rindt made his debut in Formula One at the Austrian Grand Prix, before securing a full drive with Cooper for . After mixed results with the team, he moved to Brabham for and then Lotus in . It was at Lotus that Rindt found a competitive car, although he was often concerned about the safety of the notoriously unreliable Lotus vehicles. He won his first Formula One race at the 1969 United States Grand Prix. He had a very successful 1970 season, mainly racing the revolutionary Lotus 72, and won five of the first nine races. In practice for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, he spun into the guardrails after a failure on his car's brake shaft, and a poorly installed crash barrier gave way. Rindt was pronounced dead while on the way to hospital. As his closest competitor Jacky Ickx was unable to score sufficient points in the remaining races of the season, Rindt was awarded the World Championship posthumously. Rindt left behind his wife, Nina, and a daughter, Natasha.\nOverall, he competed in 62 Grands Prix, winning six and achieving 13 podium finishes. He was also successful in sports car racing, winning the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans paired with Masten Gregory in a Ferrari 250LM. Rindt was a popular figure in Austria and his success resulted in increased interest in motorsport and Formula One in particular. He hosted a monthly television show titled \"Motorama\" and set up a successful exhibition of racing cars in Vienna. During his time in Formula One, he was involved alongside Jackie Stewart in a campaign to improve safety in Formula One.\nEarly life and family.\nJochen Rindt was born on 18 April 1942 in Mainz, Germany, to an Austrian mother and German father. His mother had been a successful tennis player in her youth and, like her father, studied law. Rindt's parents owned a spice mill in Mainz, which he later inherited. They were killed in a bombing raid in Hamburg during the Second World War when he was 15 months old, after which he was raised by his grandparents in Graz, Austria. Although his grandfather chose to retain Rindt's German citizenship, for his entire career he drove under an Austrian racing licence. In an interview, he described his heritage as a \"terrible mixture\" and, when asked if he felt more Austrian or German, said that he felt \"like a European\". Rindt had one half-brother, Uwe, through his mother.\nRindt's childhood friends and his brother described him as a \"laddish child\" who often performed tricks to amuse others. While on a skiing holiday, he broke his femoral neck, leading to several surgeries that left one leg shorter than the other. As a result of this, Rindt limped slightly for the rest of his life. At the age of sixteen, he received a moped and started racing his friends on motocross tracks. His time in school was troubled and he was excluded from schools several times. He said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHis chances of obtaining a licence were put into further jeopardy because he had collected eight recorded misdemeanours with the police during his youth. In 1960, he received his first car, an old Volkswagen Beetle. His interest in motorsport greatly increased when he visited the 1961 German Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring with school friends, including fellow future Formula One driver Helmut Marko.\nRacing career.\nBeginnings.\nRindt drove his first race at the \"Flugplatzrennen\" in 1961, in his grandmother's Simca Montlh\u00e9ry. After missing the official application period, he only entered after a friendly high-ranking motorsport functionary from Graz intervened on his behalf. During the race, he was black flagged for his dangerous driving style and therefore disqualified; he did not immediately return to the pit lane as he was unaware of the regulations. Rindt entered several rallies with his Simca but did not achieve good results. It was only when he was provided with a race-prepared at cost price and with free servicing by a local dealer that he became more successful. In the Alfa Romeo, he achieved eight victories.\nIn 1963, Rindt switched to Formula Junior with the assistance of Kurt Bardi-Barry, a wealthy owner of a travel agency and one of Austria's leading drivers at the time; Barry gave him his one-year-old Cooper T67 and the two men formed a partnership, driving to races together. Rindt was fastest in practice for his first race in Vallelunga, a race won by Barry, and took victory in his second at Cesenatico. In the race, Rindt had taken advantage of an accident in the early stages. While most drivers slowed for the incoming ambulance, he raced ahead between the straw barriers and the parked medical vehicle to take the lead. At the time, he was notorious for his dangerous style, almost crashing into the spectators at a race in the streets of Budapest.\nFormula Two.\nRindt was highly successful in Formula Two racing, amassing a total of 29 victories. He once again entered the series in partnership with Barry, driving Brabham cars. The engines provided by Cosworth were slower and inconsistent in performance; Rindt responded to his reduced pace by declaring: \"Then I just brake two metres later.\" He entered his first F2 race in April 1964 at the \"Preis von Wien\" at Aspern, retiring from both heats. The international motor racing world first took notice of him on 18 May 1964, when Rindt won the \"London Trophy\" race at the Crystal Palace circuit in a Brabham BT10 ahead of Graham Hill.\nLike many other drivers at the time, Rindt continued to race in Formula Two races alongside his duties in Formula One; his last F2 appearance was the \"Festspielpreis der Salzburg\" in August 1970. In 1967, he dominated Formula Two, winning nine races in his Brabham BT23. As an experienced Formula One driver, he was graded \"A\", meaning his results did not count towards the championship, and the title went to Jacky Ickx. Still, his performances led him to be called \"king of Formula 2\" by the racing press. He had a long-standing relationship with Roy Winkelmann, and drove with his team until it closed at the end of 1969.\nSports cars.\nAlong with single-seater racing, Rindt took up sports car racing in the mid-1960s. Rindt started at the 24 Hours of Le Mans a total of four times. At his debut in 1964, sharing a Ferrari 250LM with David Piper, the car retired too early for Rindt even to take the wheel.\nRindt's best result came the following year at the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans. Sharing the drive of a Ferrari 250LM with American Masten Gregory for the North American Racing Team, Rindt won the event. Neither driver was happy to race in a seemingly uncompetitive car. A 1998 article in \"Motor Sport\" stated that neither appeared to show much interest in the race, but instead it was \"more a case of 'hope it breaks soon' so they could draw their money and split\". At the start, the drivers had to run to their cars; Rindt entered with a forward roll that allowed him to get his foot on the throttle instantly and take an early lead. The pair experienced considerable trouble in the early part of the race; the car did not restart during Gregory's first pit stop. Later, the engine failed partially and Gregory brought the car into the pits on only six of twelve cylinders. At this point, Rindt had already changed back into his civilian clothes, expecting their race to be over. After thirty minutes of repairs, the car restarted and Rindt and Gregory agreed to drive the rest of the event \"flat out\", at full speed and with the accompanying risk. Rindt drove most of the night, advancing from 18th to third position by dawn. Gregory persuaded Rindt to let him drive the closing part of the race, suspecting that his young teammate might not drive moderately enough to nurse the car to the finish. Jacky Ickx later recalled that the two had driven \"like maniacs\". Even so, the car survived, handing the pair what Ickx called an \"unexpected victory\".\nLater that year, Rindt drove, again in a Ferrari 250LM, at the 500 kilometre race at Zeltweg. He was able to win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of Mike Parkes owing to a special lever that manually activated the brake lights. Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes to brake earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead.\nApart from his 1965 victory, he never finished the race in Le Mans. In 1966, his Ford GT40 (shared with Innes Ireland) suffered an engine failure. A year later, he drove a Porsche 907 with Gerhard Mitter until their camshaft failed.\nFormula One.\nCooper (1964\u20131967).\nRindt made his Formula One debut at his home race, the 1964 Austrian Grand Prix, in a loaned Brabham BT11 supplied by the Rob Walker Racing Team. He retired on the 58th lap with a broken steering column in his only Grand Prix of the season.\nFor the 1965 Formula One season, Rindt signed as a permanent driver with Cooper, paired with Bruce McLaren. He was not immediately successful as Cooper, formerly a top team, were struggling at the time. In his first race, the 1965 South African Grand Prix, he developed transistor trouble; the damage was initially repaired but the problem recurred and Rindt had to retire from the race. His best result was a fourth place at the German Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring. He ended the season with four points, 13th in the championship.\nFor , Cooper introduced the T81 chassis and used nine-year old Maserati V12 engines, which were powerful but heavy. A new engine formula was introduced for the season, with the capacity doubled to three litres. Many teams struggled with the new rules, leaving Cooper competitive even with their old Maserati V12s. After McLaren left, Rindt became team leader until world champion John Surtees joined from Ferrari. At the second race of the year, the Belgian Grand Prix, Rindt overcame an engine failure in practice to qualify second, next to Surtees on the front row of the grid. In a race affected by heavy rain, he overtook Surtees for the lead on lap four. He spun several times on the wet track and suffered from a limited-slip differential, but held onto the lead until lap 21, when Surtees repassed him and won. It was Rindt's first ever podium finish in Formula One, after what \"Motor Sport\" magazine called a \"very courageous\" drive. Overall, he achieved three podium positions, handing him third place in the championship at the end of the year.\n was less successful, as Rindt only finished two races, the Belgian and Italian Grands Prix, both in fourth place. Six points meant that he ended the season in 13th place in the championship.\nBrabham (1968).\nPrior to , Rindt received offers from every team except Lotus and Honda, and moved to Brabham, who had been world champions in the two previous seasons. Technical problems restricted him that year. Brabham's Repco V8 engine was not competitive against the now widely used Cosworth DFV and Rindt finished just two races, both in third place. At the season opener in South Africa on New Year's Day, Rindt placed third, being elevated by a late retirement from Jackie Stewart and closing on second-placed Graham Hill towards the end. The race was won by Jim Clark, a close friend of Rindt's. It was Clark's final Formula One race; he died three months later at a Formula Two race at Hockenheim. Rindt was deeply affected by his death, telling Austrian journalist Heinz Pr\u00fcller: \"If Jim Clark is not safe, what can happen to us?\" His second podium finish came in heavy rain and fog at the N\u00fcrburgring at the German Grand Prix, a race dominated by Stewart, who finished four minutes ahead of Hill in second place. Rindt had closed on Hill in the latter stages of the race after the Englishman spun, and finished just four seconds behind after a close battle during the last lap. His eight points placed him twelfth in the championship at the end of the season.\nDuring these years, he also raced in the Indianapolis 500 in both 1967 and 1968, but finished only 24th and 32nd, completing only five laps in 1968 after finishing slightly more than half of the 1967 race. After dropping out of the 1967 race, Rindt was interviewed on the radio network by Luke Walton. When asked what he thought of the \"500\", he said \"not much\". In an interview in 2014, Heinz Pr\u00fcller recalled Rindt speaking about Indianapolis in 1967: \"In Indianapolis, I always feel like I am on my way to my own funeral.\" At another occasion, he said about the track: \"It is catastrophic, I only drive there because of the money.\"\nTeam Lotus (1969\u20131970).\n1969 season.\nFor the 1969 season, Rindt signed for the 1968 World Constructors' Champion Lotus, where he joined the defending Drivers' Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: \"Every time I am being overtaken by my own wheel, I know I am in a Lotus.\" When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and \"de facto\" manager Bernie Ecclestone, who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham may have been a better choice of team but the speed of the Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship. Rindt commented: \"At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die.\" Because of his uncertainty about the wisdom of joining the team, Rindt did not sign the Lotus contract until shortly before the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix.\nRindt's hesitancy appeared justified when both he and Hill suffered high speed crashes at the Spanish Grand Prix at Montju\u00efc. In both instances, the suspension mounted wings on the cars broke off, causing accidents that could have killed either driver. The effect of the failure lifted Rindt's car off the track and into the barriers, where it collided with the stationary car of Hill, whose accident occurred at the same spot. Although Rindt only suffered a broken nose, one marshal lost an eye and another had his foot broken. Rindt was furious with Lotus's team owner, Colin Chapman, over the failure; he told a reporter after the accident: \"I place the blame on him [Chapman] and rightfully so, because he should have calculated that the wing would break.\" In an interview on Austrian television a day later, he said: \"These wings are insanity [\"ein Wahnsinn\"] in my eyes and should not be allowed on racing cars. ... But to get any wisdom into Colin Chapman's head is impossible.\" Asked whether he had lost trust in Lotus after the accident, he replied: \"I never had any trust in Lotus\", going on to describe his relationship with the team as \"purely business\". His accident left him sidelined for the Monaco Grand Prix, a race that Hill won.\nJackie Stewart later described Rindt's 1969 season as the year that he \"came of age\". At the end of the year, \"Motor Sport\" magazine called him \"[t]he only driver to challenge Stewart seriously throughout the season\", albeit placing only fourth in the championship. The poor reliability of the Lotus 49B affected him; he retired from seven races. At the British Grand Prix, Rindt fought a close battle with Stewart for the lead; both men were 90 seconds ahead of third-placed Jacky Ickx. The race was decided in Stewart's favour only when Rindt had to enter the pits after part of his car's bodywork started to rub on the tyre; he finished fourth. At the Italian Grand Prix, he was involved in a memorable finish. Having started from pole position, he traded the lead with Stewart and Piers Courage several times. During the last lap, Rindt, Stewart, McLaren, and Jean-Pierre Beltoise were running close together as they approached the finish line. Stewart took the win, only eight hundredths of a second ahead of Rindt, while fourth placed McLaren was also within two tenths of a second. It was the closest 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 finish in the history of the sport. Rindt recorded his maiden Grand Prix win at the penultimate race of the season at Watkins Glen, winning $50,000\u2014the largest monetary prize in Formula One history at the time. His victory was overshadowed by a serious accident involving his teammate Hill, who crashed after a high speed puncture and suffered major leg injuries.\n1970 season.\nFor , Rindt's partner at Lotus was John Miles; Graham Hill had left the team to drive for Rob Walker's customer franchise. Rindt became the clear team leader. At the first Grand Prix of the season in South Africa, he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with Chris Amon and Jack Brabham, the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career. At the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the Lotus 72 featured two, one on each side of the cockpit. Further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce unsprung weight. During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin. The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.\nAs the Lotus 72 was not as effective as the team hoped, it was returned to the factory to be re-built and Rindt used the old Lotus 49 for the next race in Monaco. The necessity of using tyres intended for the new design made the older car unstable. Seemingly unaffected by this, Rindt produced what his race engineer Herbie Blash called \"the race of his life\". From eighth on the grid, he worked his way through the field on a track notorious for presenting few overtaking opportunities. In the closing stages, he was second, steadily closing the gap on leader Jack Brabham. On the final lap, on the final corner, Brabham braked too late, touched the kerbstone and went straight ahead into the straw bales, allowing Rindt through to take his first victory of the season. Rindt used the Lotus 49 one last time at the Belgian Grand Prix, a race at which he heavily criticised the organisers for installing guardrails that had gaps of several metres between them. He had originally started practice in the remodelled 72, but the car came to a halt early in the session with a broken lower wishbone, forcing Rindt to switch cars once more. Despite engine troubles during the rest of practice, he managed to qualify on the front row, but later retired with another engine failure.\nAt the Dutch Grand Prix, Rindt eventually used the new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made. He set pole position in the final practice session, almost a quarter of a second ahead of his closest challenger, Stewart. Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, but it was not a joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.\nAfter the success at Zandvoort, Rindt gained confidence in the new Lotus 72, describing it as \"the best racing car that exists at the moment\". But he continued to have problems. During practice for the French Grand Prix, Rindt opted to drop his new all-enveloping Bell-Star crash helmet, finding it too hot. He went back to using his open-front helmet, only to be hit in the face by a stone from another car, causing a deep cut on his right cheek. He also suffered a steering failure on his car. Furious over yet another mechanical problem, he stormed into the Lotus garage and yelled at Colin Chapman: \"If this happens again and I survive, I will kill all of you!\" Rindt was still able to win the race, taking the lead in the championship. The next race was the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. Jacky Ickx established an early lead ahead of Brabham and Rindt, but when Ickx's transmission failed, Rindt seized the opportunity to pass Brabham for the lead. Brabham was then able to regain the top spot on lap 69 as Rindt missed a gear and looked the certain winner, only to repeat his misfortune of Monaco: on the last lap, he ran out of fuel, allowing Rindt to take his third win in a row. His victory was cast into doubt shortly after the race when Chief Scrutineer Cecil Mitchell found the rear aerofoil not at the regulated height. Rindt was provisionally disqualified, only to be reinstated as winner after three hours of deliberation.\nThe German Grand Prix was originally set to take place at its traditional venue, the N\u00fcrburgring. The Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA), represented by Rindt and Graham Hill, demanded changes to the circuit to increase safety, including Armco barriers along the entire of the \"Nordschleife\". No agreement was reached and the Grand Prix moved to Hockenheim, where Rindt took his fourth victory in succession. The race was another two-way fight, this time between Rindt and Ickx, who exchanged the lead several times. This meant that he could have secured the drivers' title at his home event at the Austrian Grand Prix. He set the Lotus 72 on pole position, to the delight of the crowd, but retired from the race with an engine failure. The title decision was therefore postponed to the next race in Monza.\nDeath and legacy.\nThe paddock moved to the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, a track known for high speeds; drivers often used the slipstream of cars in front to increase their pace. Because of this, many teams, including Lotus, opted to remove the rear wings mounted on the cars to reduce drag and further increase speeds. The more powerful flat-12 Ferraris of Jacky Ickx and Clay Regazzoni had been up to faster than the Lotus at the previous race in Austria. Rindt's teammate John Miles was unhappy with the wingless setup in Friday practice, reporting that the car \"wouldn't run straight\". Rindt reported no such problems, and Chapman recalled that Rindt reported the car to be \"almost 800\u00a0rpm faster on the straight\" without wings.\nOn the following day (5 September 1970), Rindt ran with higher gear ratios fitted to his car to take advantage of the reduced drag, increasing the car's potential top speed to . On his fifth lap of his practice session, he crashed heavily at the approach to the Parabolica corner. Denny Hulme, who was following Rindt at the time, described the accident as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Jochen was following me for several laps and slowly catching me up and I didn't go through the second Lesmo corner very quick so I pulled to the one side and let Jochen past me and then I followed him down into the Parabolica, ... we were going very fast and he waited until about the 200 metres to put on the brakes. The car just sort of went to the right and then it turned to the left and turned out to the right again and then suddenly just went very quickly left into the guardrail.\nUpon impact, a joint in the crash barrier parted, the suspension of the vehicle went under the barrier, and the car hit a stanchion head-on. The front end was destroyed. Rindt was in the habit of using only four points on the five-point harness then available and did not wear the crotch straps, as he wanted to be able to exit the car quickly in the event of fire. As a result, upon impact he slid under the belts, and the belts fatally slit open Rindt's throat. Later investigations found that the accident was initiated by a failure of the car's right front inboard brake shaft, but that Rindt's death was caused by poorly installed crash barriers.\nChapman rejected the assertion that the broken brake shaft had caused the accident, arguing that the shaft broke when the wheel hit the crash barrier.\nRindt was pronounced dead on the way to hospital in Milan and Lotus withdrew all cars from the race, including the Lotus 72 entered by Rob Walker. The Grand Prix went ahead and Clay Regazzoni took his maiden victory, but celebrations were muted. There was a lengthy investigation into Rindt's death in Italy, leading to a trial against Colin Chapman; he was cleared of all charges in 1976. The destroyed Lotus 72 remained in Italy after the trial, going to a scrapyard near Monza. In 1985, a real estate agent found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities, later trading it in 1993 for a Lola Formula 3 car. Since then, the car has rested in a garage near Milan.\nRindt was buried at the central cemetery (Zentralfriedhof) in Graz on 11 September 1970. At his funeral, Joakim Bonnier gave the eulogy, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To die doing something that you loved to do, is to die happy. And Jochen has the admiration and the respect of all of us. The only way you can admire and respect a great driver and friend. Regardless what happens in the remaining Grands Prix this year, to all of us, Jochen is the world champion.\nAt the time he died Rindt had won five of that year's ten Grands Prix, which meant that he had a substantial lead in the Drivers' Championship. After winning the next race in Canada, Jacky Ickx moved within 17 points of Rindt in the Championship, giving him a chance to win the title if he won the two remaining races. At the United States Grand Prix, a race won by Rindt's replacement at Lotus, Emerson Fittipaldi, Ickx placed only fourth, making Rindt motor racing's only posthumous world champion. The championship trophy was handed to his widow Nina by Jackie Stewart on 18 November 1970 in a ceremony near the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\nRindt was commemorated in many ways. The early season BARC 200 Formula Two race was renamed the \"Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy\" for as long as the series existed. In 2000, on the 30th anniversary of his death, the city of Graz unveiled a bronze plaque in remembrance of Rindt, with wife Nina and daughter Natasha present. The penultimate corner at the Red Bull Ring in Austria is named after Rindt.\nThe Historic Sports Car Club in the United Kingdom hosts a historic Formula 2 championship, whose pre-1972 category is called the \"Class A Jochen Rindt Trophy\".\nPersonal life.\nIn March 1967, Rindt married Nina Lincoln, a Finnish model and daughter of racing driver Curt Lincoln, whom he had raced in the early part of his career. After becoming engaged, Lincoln had originally broken up with Rindt and sent the engagement ring back. Rindt then put it back into the box with a note telling her to keep it until she changed her mind, which she did upon receiving the package, later explaining: \"I like men who know what they want.\" The couple moved to Switzerland, near Begnins, where they built a house together. The Rindts had one daughter, Natasha, who was two years old at the time of her father's death. Nina Rindt married twice more after Rindt's death, first Philip Martyn, with whom she had another daughter, and then Alexander Hood, 4th Viscount Bridport, making her Nina Hood, Lady Bridport. The couple had a son, Anthony. Their daughter Natasha later worked with Bernie Ecclestone for several years after he had taken over the commercial rights of Formula One.\nRindt had met Bernie Ecclestone during his time at Cooper and the two became friends. Noticing his commercial talent, Rindt allowed Ecclestone to manage his professional contracts, without ever officially employing him as a manager. Ecclestone said of the relationship: \"I was never his manager, we were good friends. I helped him with any help he ever needed.\" After Rindt's accident, it was Ecclestone who carried his bloody helmet back to the pit lane.\nIn Formula One, Rindt had several friendly relationships with other drivers, most notably Jackie Stewart. They met at a Formula Two event in 1964 and soon became friends, often going on holiday together and living near each other in Switzerland. Until his death, they were sometimes accompanied by Jim Clark. Rindt became involved in Stewart's fight for increased safety in Formula One, being one of the leading figures of the GPDA. For his role in the safety campaign, Rindt was criticised by fellow drivers and the press alike; reporters derogatively called Stewart, Rindt and Joakim Bonnier the \"Geneva connection\", due to their residence in Switzerland. Stewart said that it took Rindt some time to understand the graveness of the situation but after that, he was a \"good ally\". After Rindt's death, his wife Nina stayed close with the Stewarts and can be seen visiting them at the 1971 Monaco Grand Prix in the Roman Polanski-produced film \"Weekend of a Champion\".\nPrivately, Rindt was known to family and friends as an often reckless driver when on public roads. During the early years of his career, he took his Jaguar E-Type out in the streets of Vienna, where he lived, and drifted through the streets. He sparked public criticism in 1968 when he flipped over a during a demonstration run at an autocross event in Gro\u00dfh\u00f6flein, while his pregnant wife was on board.\nRindt's success popularised motorsport in Austria. Helmut Zwickl called him \"the driving instructor of the nation\". In 1965, Rindt put together the first exhibition of racing cars in Austria, the \"Jochen-Rindt-Show\" in Vienna. It was an immediate success, with 30,000 visitors on the first weekend alone. Using his connections, he brought in his friend Joakim Bonnier and former Mercedes Grand Prix manager Alfred Neubauer as opening speakers, with other drivers such as Jackie Stewart attending. The show soon became an annual event and later moved to the German city of Essen in 1970, shortly after Rindt's death, and remains there as the Essen Motor Show. Rindt, with the help of Ecclestone, was able to successfully promote himself, including lucrative sponsorship and advertising contracts. Following his ascent in racing, two race tracks were built in Austria, the \u00d6sterreichring (now Red Bull Ring), for which Rindt worked as a consultant, and the Salzburgring. Rindt's popularity was further increased through the TV show \"Motorama\", which he hosted. The monthly programme included tips for driving on public roads, reports from Grands Prix and interviews of fellow drivers by Rindt.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFilm sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

This region also includes the only subtropical dry broadleaf forest in the Nearctic realm, the Sonoran\u2013Sinaloan transition subtropical dry forest.\nIn terms of floristic provinces, it is represented by the Madrean Region.\nHistory.\nAlthough North America and South America are presently joined by the Isthmus of Panama, these continents were separated for about 180 million years, and evolved very different plant and animal lineages. When the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea split into two about 180 million years ago, North America remained joined to Eurasia as part of the supercontinent of Laurasia, while South America was part of the supercontinent of Gondwana. North America later split from Eurasia. North America has been joined by land bridges to both Asia and South America since then, which allowed an exchange of plant and animal species between the continents, the Great American Interchange.\nA former land bridge across the Bering Strait between Asia and North America allowed many plants and animals to move between these continents, and the Nearctic realm shares many plants and animals with the Palearctic. The two realms are sometimes included in a single Holarctic realm.\nMany large animals, or megafauna, including horses, camels, tapirs, mammoths, mastodons, ground sloths, sabre-tooth cats (\"Smilodon\"), short-faced bears and the American cheetah, became extinct in North America at the end of the Pleistocene epoch (ice ages) in what is called the Quaternary extinction event.\nFlora and fauna.\nFlora and fauna that originated in the Nearctic.\nMammals originally unique to the Nearctic include:\nFlora and fauna endemic to the Nearctic.\nTwo mammal families are endemic to the Nearctic, the pronghorns (Antilocapridae) and the mountain beaver (Aplodontiidae).

{"id": "45394", "revid": "11639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45394", "title": "Neotropical realm", "text": "One of Earth's eight biogeographic realms\nThe Neotropical realm is one of the eight biogeographic realms constituting Earth's land surface. Physically, it includes the tropical terrestrial ecoregions of the Americas and the entire South American temperate zone.\nDefinition.\nIn biogeography, the Neotropic or Neotropical realm is one of the eight terrestrial realms. This realm includes South America, Central America, the Caribbean Islands, and southern North America. In Mexico, the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and southern lowlands, and most of the east and west coastlines, including the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula are Neotropical. In the United States, South Florida and coastal Central Florida are considered Neotropical.\nThe realm also includes temperate southern South America. In contrast, the Neotropical Floristic Kingdom excludes southernmost South America, which instead is placed in the Antarctic kingdom.\nThe Neotropic is delimited by similarities in fauna or flora. Its fauna and flora are distinct from the Nearctic realm (which includes most of North America) because of the long separation of the two continents. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama joined the two continents two to three million years ago, precipitating the Great American Interchange, an important biogeographical event.\nThe Neotropic includes more tropical rainforest (tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests) than any other realm, extending from southern Mexico through Central America and northern South America to southern Brazil, including the vast Amazon rainforest. These rainforest ecoregions are one of the most important reserves of biodiversity on Earth. These rainforests are also home to a diverse array of indigenous peoples, who to varying degrees persist in their autonomous and traditional cultures and subsistence within this environment. The number of these peoples who are as yet relatively untouched by external influences continues to decline significantly, however, along with the near-exponential expansion of urbanization, roads, pastoralism and forest industries which encroach on their customary lands and environment. Nevertheless, amidst these declining circumstances this vast \"reservoir\" of human diversity continues to survive, albeit much depleted. In South America alone, some 350\u2013400 indigenous languages and dialects are still living (down from an estimated 1,500 at the time of first European contact), in about 37 distinct language families and a further number of unclassified and isolate languages. Many of these languages and their cultures are also endangered. Accordingly, conservation in the Neotropical realm is a hot political concern, and raises many arguments about development versus indigenous versus ecological rights and access to or ownership of natural resources.\nMajor ecological regions.\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) subdivides the realm into \"bioregions\", defined as \"geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)\".\nLaurel forest and other cloud forest are subtropical and mild temperate forest, found in areas with high humidity and relatively stable and mild temperatures. Tropical rainforest, tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests are highlight in Southern North America, Amazonia, Caribbean, Central America, Northern Andes and Central Andes.\nAmazonia.\nThe Amazonia bioregion is mostly covered by tropical moist broadleaf forest, including the vast Amazon rainforest, which stretches from the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, and the lowland forests of the Guianas. The bioregion also includes tropical savanna and tropical dry forest ecoregions.\nCentral Andes.\nThe Central Andes lie between the gulfs of Guayaquil and Penas and thus encompass southern Ecuador, Chile, Peru, western Bolivia, and northwest and western Argentina.\nEastern South America.\nEastern South America includes the Caatinga xeric shrublands of northeastern Brazil, the broad Cerrado grasslands and savannas of the Brazilian Plateau, and the Pantanal and Chaco grasslands. The diverse Atlantic forests of eastern Brazil are separated from the forests of Amazonia by the Caatinga and Cerrado, and are home to a distinct flora and fauna.\nNorthern Andes.\nNorth of the Gulf of Guayaquil in Ecuador and Colombia, a series of accreted oceanic terranes (discrete allochthonous fragments) have developed that constitute the Baudo, or Coastal, Mountains and the Cordillera Occidental.\nOrinoco.\nThe Orinoco is a region of humid forested broadleaf forest and wetland primarily comprising the drainage basin for the Orinoco River and other adjacent lowland forested areas. This region includes most of Venezuela and parts of Colombia, as well as Trinidad and Tobago.\nSouthern South America.\nThe temperate forest ecoregions of southwestern South America, including the temperate rain forests of the Valdivian temperate rain forests and Magellanic subpolar forests ecoregions, and the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands and Desventuradas Islands, are a refuge for the ancient Antarctic flora, which includes trees like the southern beech (\"Nothofagus\"), podocarps, the alerce (\"Fitzroya cupressoides\"), and Araucaria pines like the monkey-puzzle tree (\"Araucaria araucana\"). These rainforests are endangered by extensive logging and their replacement by fast-growing non-native pines and eucalyptus.\nHistory.\nSouth America was originally part of the supercontinent of Gondwana, which included Africa, Australia, India, New Zealand, and Antarctica, and the Neotropic shares many plant and animal lineages with these other continents, including marsupial mammals and the Antarctic flora.\nAfter the final breakup of the Gondwana about 110 million years ago, South America was separated from Africa and drifted north and west. 66 million years ago, the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event altered local flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=\"10.1126/science.abf1969\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Much later, about two to three million years ago, South America was joined with North America by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, which allowed a biotic exchange between the two continents, the Great American Interchange. South American species like the ancestors of the Virginia opossum (\"Didelphis virginiana\") and the armadillo moved into North America, and North Americans like the ancestors of South America's camelids, including the llama (\"Lama glama\"), moved south. The long-term effect of the exchange was the extinction of many South American species, mostly by outcompetition by northern species.\nEndemic animals and plants.\nAnimals.\nThe Neotropical realm has 31 endemic bird families, which is over twice the number of any other realm. They include tanagers, rheas, tinamous, curassows, antbirds, ovenbirds, toucans, and seriemas. Bird families originally unique to the Neotropics include hummingbirds (family Trochilidae) and wrens (family Troglodytidae).\nMammal groups originally unique to the Neotropics include:\nThe Neotropical realm has 63 endemic fish families and subfamilies, which is more than any other realm. Neotropical fishes include more than 5,700 species, and represent at least 66 distinct lineages in continental freshwaters (Albert and Reis, 2011). The well-known red-bellied piranha is endemic to the Neotropic realm, occupying a larger geographic area than any other piranha species. Some fish groups originally unique to the Neotropics include:\nExamples of other animal groups that are entirely or mainly restricted to the Neotropical region include:\nPlants.\nAccording to Simberloff. as of 1984 there were a total of 92,128 species of flowering plants (Angiosperms) in the Neotropics.\nPlant families endemic and partly subendemic to the realm are, according to Takhtajan (1978), Hymenophyllopsidaceae, Marcgraviaceae, Caryocaraceae, Pellicieraceae, Quiinaceae, Peridiscaceae, Bixaceae, Cochlospermaceae, Tovariaceae, Lissocarpaceae (\"Lissocarpa\"), Brunelliaceae, Dulongiaceae, Columelliaceae, Julianiaceae, Picrodendraceae, Goupiaceae, Desfontainiaceae, Plocospermataceae, Tropaeolaceae, Dialypetalanthaceae (\"Dialypetalanthus\"), Nolanaceae (\"Nolana\"), Calyceraceae, Heliconiaceae, Cannaceae, Thurniaceae, and Cyclanthaceae.\nPlant families that originated in the Neotropic include Bromeliaceae, Cannaceae and Heliconiaceae.\nPlant species with economic importance originally unique to the Neotropic include:\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45396", "revid": "36378140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45396", "title": "Rudolph Valentino", "text": "Italian actor (1895\u20131926)\nRodolfo Pietro Filiberto Raffaello Guglielmi di Valentina d'Antonguella (May 6, 1895\u00a0\u2013 August 23, 1926), known professionally as Rudolph Valentino and nicknamed The Latin Lover, was an Italian actor who starred in several well-known silent films including \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\", \"The Sheik\" (both 1921), \"Blood and Sand\" (1922), \"The Eagle\" (1925), \nand \"The Son of the Sheik\" (1926).\nValentino was a sex symbol of the 1920s, known in Hollywood as the \"Latin Lover\" (a title invented for him by Hollywood moguls), the \"Great Lover\", or simply Valentino. His early death at the age of 31 caused mass hysteria among his fans, further cementing his place in early cinematic history as a cultural film icon.\nEarly life.\nChildhood and emigration.\nValentino was born in Castellaneta, Apulia, Italy and named Rodolfo Pietro Filiberto Raffaello Guglielmi di Valentina d'Antonguella. His father, Giovanni Antonio Giuseppe Fedele Guglielmi di Valentina d'Antonguella, was an Italian from Martina Franca, Apulia; he was a captain of cavalry in the Italian Army, later a veterinarian, who died of malaria when Valentino was 11. His mother, Marie Berthe Gabrielle Barbin (1856\u20131918), was French with Torinese ancestry (the original family name was Barbini, gallicized to Barbin later on), born in Lure in the Franche-Comt\u00e9 region. She was lady-in-waiting to a local marquess. Valentino had an older brother, Alberto (1892\u20131981), a younger sister, Maria, and an older sister, Beatrice, who had died in infancy.\nAs a child, Valentino was indulged because of his exceptional looks and his playful personality. His mother coddled him, while his father disapproved of him. He did poorly in school and was eventually enrolled in agricultural school in Genoa, where he earned a certificate.\nAfter living in Paris in 1912, he soon returned to Italy. Unable to secure employment, he departed for the United States in 1913. He was processed at Ellis Island at age 18 on December 23, 1913.\nValentino never applied for United States citizenship, and retained his Italian citizenship.\nNew York.\nArriving in New York City, he supported himself with odd jobs such as busing tables in restaurants and gardening. Valentino once worked as a bus boy at Murray's on 42nd Street and was well liked, but didn't do a good job and was fired. While he was living on the streets, Valentino would occasionally come back to Murray's for lunch and the staff would slip him some food. Around 1914, restaurateur Joe Pani who owned Castles-by-the-Sea, the Colony, and the Woodmansten Inn was the first to hire Rudolph to dance the tango with Joan Sawyer for $50 per week. Eventually, he found work as a taxi dancer at Maxim's Restaurant-Cabaret. Among the other dancers at Maxim's were several displaced members of European nobility, for whom a premium demand existed.\nValentino eventually befriended Chilean heiress Blanca de Saulles, who was unhappily married to businessman John de Saulles, with whom she had a son. Whether Blanca and Valentino actually had a romantic relationship is unknown, but when the de Saulles divorced, Valentino took the stand to support Blanca de Saulles's claims of infidelity on her husband's part. Following the divorce, John de Saulles reportedly used his political connections to have Valentino arrested, along with a Mrs. Thyme, a known madam, on some unspecified vice charges. The evidence was flimsy at best, and after a few days in jail, Valentino's bail was lowered from $10,000 to $1,500.\nShortly after the trial, Blanca de Saulles fatally shot her ex-husband during a custody dispute over their son. Following his own well-publicised trial and the subsequent scandal over the murder, Valentino could not find employment. Fearful of being called in as a witness in another sensational trial, Valentino left town and joined a traveling musical that led him to the West Coast.\nFilm career.\nBefore fame.\nIn 1917, Valentino joined an operetta company that traveled to Utah, where it disbanded. He then joined an Al Jolson production of \"Robinson Crusoe, Jr.\", which was travelling to Los Angeles. By fall, he was in San Francisco with a bit part in a theatrical production of \"Nobody Home\". While in town, Valentino met actor Norman Kerry, who convinced him to try a career in cinema, which was still in the silent film era.\nValentino and Kerry moved back to Los Angeles and became roommates at the Alexandria Hotel. He continued dancing, teaching dance, and building up a following that included older female clientele who would let him borrow their luxury cars. At one point after the United States entered World War I, both Kerry and Valentino tried to get into the Canadian Air Force to fly and fight in France.\nWith his dancing success, Valentino found a room of his own on Sunset Boulevard and began actively seeking screen roles. His first part was as an extra in the film \"Alimony\", moving on to small parts in several films. Despite his best efforts, he was typically cast as a \"heavy\" (villain) or gangster. At the time, the archetypal major male star was Wallace Reid, with a fair complexion, light eyes, and an All-American look, with Valentino the opposite; he eventually supplanted Sessue Hayakawa as Hollywood's most popular \"exotic\" male lead.\nBy 1919, he had carved out a career in bit parts. It was a bit part as a \"cabaret parasite\" in the drama \"Eyes of Youth\", starring Clara Kimball Young, that caught the attention of screenwriter June Mathis, who thought he would be perfect for her next movie. Young would later say it was she and Lewis J. Selznick who discovered him, and that they were disappointed when Valentino accepted a lucrative offer at Metro.\nHe appeared as second lead in \"The Delicious Little Devil\" (1919) with star Mae Murray. In 1919, Valentino impulsively married actress Jean Acker. Their marriage was purportedly never consummated.\nActing.\nDispleased with playing \"heavies,\" Valentino briefly entertained the idea of returning to New York permanently. He returned for a visit in 1917, staying with friends in Greenwich Village, eventually settling in Bayside, Queens. There he met Paul Ivano, who would greatly help his career.\nWhile traveling to Palm Springs, California, to film \"Stolen Moments\", Valentino read the novel \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" by Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez. Seeking out a trade paper, he discovered that Metro had bought the film rights to the story. In New York, he sought out Metro's office, only to discover that June Mathis had been trying to find him. She cast him in the role of Julio Desnoyers. For the director, Mathis had chosen Rex Ingram, with whom Valentino did not get along, leading Mathis to play the role of peacekeeper between the two.\n\"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" was released in 1921 and became a commercial and critical success. It was one of the first films to make $1,000,000 at the box office, the sixth-highest grossing silent film ever.\nMetro Pictures seemed unwilling to acknowledge that it had made a star. Most likely due to Rex Ingram's lack of faith in Valentino, the studio refused to give him a raise beyond the $350 a week he had made for \"Four Horsemen\". For his follow-up film, they forced him into a bit part in a B-film called \"Uncharted Seas\". On this film, Valentino met his second wife, Natacha Rambova. That same year, Valentino's legal wife, Jean Acker, successfully sued for divorce.\nRambova, Mathis, Ivano, and Valentino began work on the Alla Nazimova film \"Camille\". Valentino was cast in the role of Armand, Nazimova's love interest. The film, mostly under the control of Rambova and Nazimova, was considered too \"avant garde\" by critics and the public.\nValentino's final film for Metro was the Mathis-penned \"The Conquering Power\". The film received critical acclaim and did well at the box office. After the film's release, Valentino made a trip to New York, where he met with several French producers. Yearning for Europe, better pay, and more respect, Valentino returned and promptly quit Metro.\n\"The Sheik\".\nAfter quitting Metro, Valentino took up with Famous Players\u2013Lasky, forerunner of the present-day Paramount Pictures, a studio known for films that were more commercially focused. Mathis soon joined him, angering both Ivano and Rambova.\nJesse L. Lasky intended to capitalize on the star power of Valentino, and cast him in a role that solidified his reputation as the \"Latin lover\". In \"The Sheik\" (1921), Valentino played the starring role of Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan. The film was a major success and defined not only his career but his image and legacy. Valentino tried to distance the character from a stereotypical portrayal of an Arab man. Asked if Lady Diana (his love interest) would have fallen for a \"savage\" in real life, Valentino replied, \"People are not savages because they have dark skins. The Arabian civilization is one of the oldest in the world ... the Arabs are dignified and keen-brained.\"\nFamous Players produced four more feature-length films over the next 15 months. His leading role in \"Moran of the Lady Letty\" was of a typical Douglas Fairbanks nature; however, to capitalize on Valentino's bankability, his character was given a Spanish name and ancestry. The film received mixed reviews, but was still a hit with audiences.\nIn November 1921, Valentino starred alongside Gloria Swanson in \"Beyond the Rocks\". The film contained lavish sets and extravagant costumes, though \"Photoplay\" magazine said the film was \"a little unreal and hectic.\" Released in 1922, the film was a critical disappointment. Years after its release, \"Beyond the Rocks\" was thought to be lost, save for a one-minute portion. But in 2002, the film was discovered by the Netherlands Film Museum. The restored version was released on DVD in 2006.\nIn February, 1922 \"Life\" magazine reported that, according to the Famous Players press office, Valentino would henceforth be known as \"Rodolph\" rather than \"Rudolph.\"\nIn 1922, Valentino began work on another Mathis-penned film, \"Blood and Sand\". He played the lead\u2014bullfighter Juan Gallardo\u2014and co-starred with Lila Lee and Nita Naldi. Initially believing the film would be shot in Spain, Valentino was upset to learn that the studio planned on shooting on a Hollywood back lot. He was further irritated by changes in production, including a director of whom he did not approve.\nAfter finishing the film, Valentino married Rambova, which led to a bigamy trial, as he had been divorced from his first wife, Jean Acker, for less than a full year, as required by California law at the time. The trial was a sensation and the pair was forced to have their marriage annulled and to be separated for a year. Despite the trial, the film was still a success, with critics calling it a masterpiece on par with \"Broken Blossoms\" and \"Four Horsemen\". \"Blood and Sand\" became one of the four top-grossing movies of 1922, breaking attendance records, and grossing $37,400 at the Rivoli Theatre alone. Valentino considered this one of his best films.\nDuring his forced break from Rambova, the pair began working separately on the Mathis-penned \"The Young Rajah\". Only fragments of this film, recovered in 2005, still remain. The film did not live up to expectations and underperformed at the box office. Valentino felt he had underperformed in the film, being upset over his separation with Rambova. Missing Rambova, Valentino returned to New York after the release of \"The Young Rajah\". They were spotted and followed by reporters constantly. During this time, Valentino began to contemplate not returning to Famous Players, although Jesse Lasky already had his next picture, \"The Spanish Cavalier\", in preparation. After speaking with Rambova and his lawyer Arthur Butler Graham, Valentino declared a 'one-man strike' against Famous Players.\nStrike against Famous Players.\nValentino went on strike for financial reasons. At the time of his lawsuit against the studio, he was earning $1,250 per week, with an increase to $3,000 after three years. This was $7,000 per week less than Mary Pickford made in 1916. He was also upset over the broken promise of filming \"Blood and Sand\" in Spain, and the failure to shoot the next proposed film in either Spain or at least New York. Valentino had hoped while filming in Europe he could see his family, whom he had not seen in 10 years.\nIn September 1922, he refused to accept paychecks from Famous Players until the dispute was solved, although he owed them money he had spent to pay off Jean Acker. Angered, Famous Players, in turn, filed suit against him.\nValentino did not back down, and Famous Players realized how much they stood to lose. In trouble after shelving Roscoe Arbuckle pictures, the studio tried to settle by upping his salary from $1,250 to $7,000 a week. \"Variety\" erroneously announced the salary increase as a \"new contract\" before news of the lawsuit was released, and Valentino angrily rejected the offer.\nValentino went on to claim that artistic control was more of an issue than the money. He wrote an open letter to \"Photoplay\" magazine, titled \"Open Letter to the American Public\", in which he argued his case, although the average American had trouble sympathizing, as most made $2,000 a year. Famous Players made their own public statements deeming him more trouble than he was worth (the divorce, bigamy trials, debts) and that he was temperamental, almost diva-like. They claimed to have done all they could and that they had made him a real star.\nOther studios began courting him. Joseph Schenck was interested in casting his wife, Norma Talmadge, opposite Valentino in a version of \"Romeo and Juliet\". June Mathis had moved to Goldwyn Pictures, where she was in charge of the \"Ben-Hur\" project, and interested in casting Valentino in the film. However, Famous Players exercised its option to extend his contract, preventing him from accepting any employment other than with the studio. By this point, Valentino was about $80,000 in debt. He filed an appeal, a portion of which was granted. Although he was still not allowed to work as an actor, he could accept other types of employment.\nMineralava Dance Tour.\nIn late 1922, Valentino met George Ullman, who soon became his manager. Ullman had previously worked with Mineralava Beauty Clay Company, and convinced them that Valentino would be perfect as a spokesman with his legions of female fans.\nThe tour was a tremendous success, with Valentino and Rambova performing in 88 cities in the United States and Canada. In addition to the tour, Valentino also sponsored Mineralava beauty products and judged Mineralava-sponsored beauty contests. One beauty contest was filmed by a young David O. Selznick, who titled it \"Rudolph Valentino and his 88 Beauties.\"\nReturn to films.\nValentino returned to the United States in reply to an offer from Ritz-Carlton Pictures (working through Famous Players), which included $7,500 a week, creative control, and filming in New York. Rambova negotiated a two-picture deal with Famous Players and four pictures for Ritz-Carlton. He accepted, turning down an offer to film an Italian production of \"Quo Vadis\" in Italy.\nThe first film under the new contract was \"Monsieur Beaucaire,\" wherein Valentino played the lead, the Duke of Chartres. The film did poorly and American audiences found it \"effeminate\". The failure of the film, under Rambova's control, is often seen as proof of her controlling nature and later caused her to be barred from Valentino sets. Valentino made one final movie for Famous Players. In 1924, he starred in \"A Sainted Devil,\" now one of his lost films. It had lavish costumes, but apparently a weak story. It opened to strong sales, but soon dropped off in attendance and ended up as another disappointment.\nWith his contract fulfilled, Valentino was released from Famous Players, but was still obligated to Ritz-Carlton for four films. His next film was a pet project titled \"The Hooded Falcon.\" The production was beset with problems from the start, beginning with the script written by June Mathis. The Valentinos were dissatisfied with Mathis's version and requested that it be rewritten. Mathis took it as a great insult and did not speak to Valentino for almost two years. While Rambova worked designing costumes and rewriting the script for \"Falcon,\" Valentino was persuaded to film \"Cobra\" with Nita Naldi. He agreed only on condition that it not be released until after \"The Hooded Falcon\" debuted.\nAfter filming \"Cobra,\" the cast of \"The Hooded Falcon\" sailed for France to be fitted for costumes. After three months, they returned to the United States, where Valentino's new beard, which he had grown for the film, caused a sensation. \"I opened once a paper and I tell you what was in. It was Rudolph Valentino with a beard upon his chin. My heart stopped off from beating and I fainted dead away, and I never want to come to life until the judgement day,\" was soon printed in \"Photoplay.\" The cast and crew left for Hollywood to begin preparations for the film, but much of the budget was taken up during preproduction. Due to the Valentinos' lavish spending on costumes and sets, Ritz-Carlton terminated the deal with the couple, effectively ending Valentino's contract with them.\nUnited Artists.\nDuring the filming of \"Monsieur Beaucaire\", both Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks approached Valentino privately, due to his contract with Ritz-Carlton, about joining with United Artists. Valentino's contract with United Artists provided $10,000 a week for only three pictures a year, plus a percentage of his films. The contract excluded Rambova from production of his films and the film set. Valentino's acceptance of the terms caused a major rift in his marriage to Rambova. George Ullman, who had negotiated the contract with United Artists, offered Rambova $30,000 to finance a film of her own. It became her only film, titled \"What Price Beauty?\" and starred Myrna Loy.\nValentino chose his first UA project, \"The Eagle\". With the marriage under strain, Valentino began shooting and Rambova announced that she needed a \"marital vacation\". During the filming of \"The Eagle\", rumors of an affair with co-star Vilma B\u00e1nky were reported and ultimately denied by both B\u00e1nky and Valentino. The film opened to positive reviews, but a moderate box office.\nFor the film's release, Valentino travelled to London, staying there and in France, spending money with abandon while his divorce took place. Quite some time elapsed before he made another film, \"The Son of the Sheik,\" despite his hatred of the sheik image. The film began shooting in February 1926, with Valentino given his choice of director, and pairing him again with Vilma B\u00e1nky. The film used the authentic costumes he bought abroad and allowed him to play a dual role. Valentino was ill during production, but he needed the money to pay his many debts. The film opened on July 9, 1926, to great fanfare. During the premiere, Valentino was reconciled with Mathis; the two had not spoken in almost two years.\nPublic image.\nDating back to the de Saulles trial in New York, during which his \"masculinity\" had been questioned in print, Valentino had been very sensitive about his public perception. \nWith the Fairbanks-type being the supposed epitome of manhood, Valentino was sometimes portrayed as a threat to the \"All American\" man. One man, asked in a street interview in 1922 what he thought of Valentino, replied,\n \"Many other men desire to be another Douglas Fairbanks. But Valentino? I wonder\u00a0...\"\nWomen in the same interview found Valentino\n \"triumphantly seductive. Puts the love-making of the average husband or sweetheart into discard as tame, flat, and unimpassioned.\"\nSome journalists were still calling his \"masculinity\" into question, going on at length about his pomaded hair, his dandyish clothing, his treatment of women, his views on women, and whether he was \"effeminate\". \nValentino hated these stories and was known to carry clippings of the newspaper articles around with him and criticize them.\nIn July 1926, the \"Chicago Tribune\" reported that a vending machine dispensing pink talcum powder (face powder) had appeared in an upscale hotel's men's washroom. An editorial that followed used the story to protest the supposed feminization of American men, and blamed the talcum powder on Valentino and his films. The piece infuriated Valentino and he challenged the writer to his choice of a boxing or wrestling match, since dueling was illegal. Neither challenge was answered.\nShortly afterward, Valentino met with journalist H. L. Mencken for advice on how best to deal with the incident. Mencken advised Valentino to \"let the dreadful farce roll along to exhaustion\", but Valentino insisted the editorial was \"infamous\".\nMencken found Valentino to be likable and gentlemanly and wrote sympathetically of him in an article published in \"The Baltimore Sun\" a week after Valentino's death:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was not that trifling Chicago episode that was riding him; it was the whole grotesque futility of his life. Had he achieved, out of nothing, a vast and dizzy success? Then that success was hollow as well as vast \u2013 a colossal and preposterous nothing. Was he acclaimed by yelling multitudes? Then every time the multitudes yelled he felt himself blushing inside ... The thing, at the start, must have only bewildered him, but in those last days, unless I am a worse psychologist than even the professors of psychology, it was revolting him. Worse, it was making him afraid\u00a0...\nHere was a young man who was living daily the dream of millions of other men. Here was one who was catnip to women. Here was one who had wealth and fame. And here was one who was very unhappy. \nAfter Valentino challenged the \"Tribune's\" anonymous writer to a boxing match, the \"New York Evening Journal\" boxing writer, Frank O'Neill, volunteered to fight in his place. Valentino won the bout, which took place on the roof of New York's Ambassador Hotel.\nHeavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, who trained Valentino and other Hollywood notables of the era in boxing, said of him:\n \"He was the most virile and masculine of men. The women were like flies to a honeypot. He could never shake them off, anywhere he went. What a lovely, lucky guy.\"\nValentino's sex symbol status and his untimely death were a biographical part in John Dos Passos' \"The Big Money\" in the U.S.A. trilogy. His title was the Adagio Dancer.\nOther ventures.\nIn 1923, Valentino published a book of poetry titled \"Day Dreams\". He later serialized events in various magazines. With \"Liberty\" magazine, he wrote a series entitled, \"How You Can Keep Fit\" in 1923. \"My Life Story\" was serialized in \"Photoplay\" during his dance tour. The March issue was one of the best-selling ever for the magazine. He followed that with \"My Private Diary\", serialized in \"Movie Weekly\" magazine. Most of the serials were later published as books after his death.\nValentino was fascinated with every part of movie-making. During production on a Mae Murray film, he spent time studying the director's plans. He craved authenticity and wished to shoot on location, finally forming his own production company, Rudolph Valentino Productions, in 1925. Valentino, George Ullman, and Beatrice Ullman were the incorporators.\nOn May 14, 1923, while in New York City, Valentino made his only two vocal recordings for Brunswick Records; \"Kashmiri Song\" (\"The Sheik\") and \"El Relicario\" (\"Blood and Sand\"). The recordings were not released until after Valentino's death by the Celebrity Recording Company; Brunswick did not release them because Valentino's English/Spanish pronunciation was subpar.\nValentino was one of the first in Hollywood to offer an award for artistic accomplishments in films; the Academy Awards later followed suit. In 1925, he gave out his only medal to John Barrymore for his performance in \"Beau Brummel\". The award, named the Rudolph Valentino Medal, required the agreement of Valentino, two judges, and the votes of 75 critics. Everyone other than Valentino himself was eligible.\nPersonal life.\nValentino once told gossip columnist Louella Parsons that:\n \"The women I love don't love me. The others don't matter.\"\nHe claimed that despite his success as a sex symbol, in his personal love life he never achieved happiness.\nIn 1919 \u2013 just before the rise of his career \u2013 Valentino impulsively married actress Jean Acker, who was involved with actresses Grace Darmond and Alla Nazimova. Acker became involved with Valentino in part to remove herself from the lesbian love triangle, quickly regretted the marriage, and locked Valentino out of their room on their wedding night. The couple separated soon after, and the marriage was never consummated. The couple remained legally married until 1921, when Acker sued Valentino for divorce, citing desertion. The divorce was granted, with Acker receiving alimony. She and Valentino eventually renewed their friendship, and remained friends until his death.\nValentino first met Winifred Shaughnessy, known by her stage name, Natacha Rambova\u2014an American silent film costume and set designer, art director, and prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Nazimova\u2014on the set of \"Uncharted Seas\" in 1921. The two worked together on the Nazimova production of \"Camille,\" by which time they were romantically involved. They married on May 13, 1922, in Mexicali, Mexico, which resulted in Valentino's arrest for bigamy, since he had not been divorced for a full year, as required by California law at the time. Days passed and \"Famous Players\u2013Lasky\" (his studio at the time) refused to post bail. Eventually, a few friends posted the cash bail. He was also investigated for a possible violation of the Mann Act.\nHaving to wait the year or face the possibility of being arrested again, Rambova and Valentino lived in separate apartments in New York City, each with their own roommates. On 14\u00a0March 1923, they legally remarried at the Lake County Court House in Crown Point, Indiana.\nMany of Valentino's friends disliked Rambova and found her controlling. During his relationship with her, he lost many friends and business associates, including June Mathis. Towards the end of their marriage, Rambova was banned from his sets by contract. Valentino and Rambova divorced in 1925. The end of the marriage was bitter, with Valentino bequeathing Rambova one dollar in his will.\nFrom the time he died in 1926 until the 1960s, Valentino's sexuality was not generally questioned in print. At least four books, including the notoriously libelous \"Hollywood Babylon\", suggested that he may have been gay despite his marriage to Rambova. For some, the marriages to Acker and Rambova, as well as the relationship with Pola Negri, add to the suspicion that Valentino was gay and that these were \"lavender marriages\".\nSome claim that Valentino had a relationship with Ram\u00f3n Novarro, despite Novarro stating they barely knew each other. \"Hollywood Babylon\" recounts a story that Valentino had given Novarro an art deco dildo as a gift, which was found stuffed in his throat at the time of his murder. It is believed that no such gift existed. There were also claims that he may have had relationships with both roommates Paul Ivano and Douglas Gerrad, as well as Norman Kerry, and openly gay French theatre director and poet Jacques H\u00e9bertot. However, Ivano maintained that it was untrue and both he and Valentino were heterosexual. Biographers Emily Leider and Allan Ellenberger generally agree that he was most likely straight.\nThere was further supposed evidence that Valentino was gay; documents in the estate of the late author Samuel Steward indicated that Valentino and Steward were sexual partners. However, evidence found in Steward's claim was subsequently found to be false, as Valentino was in New York on the date Steward claimed a sexual encounter occurred in Ohio.\nShortly before his death, Valentino was dating \"Ziegfeld Follies\" showgirl Marion Wilson Benda while he was also involved in a relationship with actress Pola Negri. Upon his death, Negri made a scene at his funeral, claiming they had been engaged, in spite of the fact that Valentino himself had never mentioned this engagement to anyone.\nDeath.\nOn August 15, 1926, Valentino collapsed at the Hotel Ambassador on Park Avenue in Manhattan. He was hospitalized at the New York Polyclinic Hospital. Following an examination, he was diagnosed with appendicitis and gastric ulcers, and surgery was performed immediately. (His condition would eventually be referred to as \"Valentino's syndrome\"\u2014perforated ulcers mimicking appendicitis.) After surgery, Valentino developed peritonitis. On August 18, his doctors were optimistic about his prognosis. The media were told that unless Valentino's condition deteriorated, no updates would be given. However, his condition worsened on August 21. He was stricken with a severe relapse of pleuritis, which developed rapidly in his left lung due to his weakened condition. The doctors realized that Valentino was going to die, but as was common at the time, chose to withhold this information. Valentino reportedly believed that he would recover. During the early hours of Monday, August 23, Valentino was briefly conscious and chatted with his doctors about his future, but soon lapsed into a coma. He died a few hours later at the age of 31. Following Valentino's death, doctors who treated him later confirmed that the actor had contracted sepsis, an overwhelming infection.\nFuneral.\nAn estimated 100,000 people lined the streets of Manhattan to pay their respects at his funeral, handled by the Frank Campbell Funeral Home. Suicides of despondent fans were reported. Windows were smashed as fans tried to get in and an all-day riot erupted on August 24. Over 100 mounted officers and NYPD's Police Reserve were used to restore order. A phalanx of officers lined the streets for the remainder of the viewing. Polish actress Pola Negri, claiming to be Valentino's fianc\u00e9e, collapsed in hysterics while standing over the coffin, and Campbell hired four actors to impersonate a Fascist Blackshirt honor guard, purportedly sent by Benito Mussolini. Media reports that the body on display in the main salon was not Valentino but a decoy were continually denied by Campbell.\nValentino's funeral mass in Manhattan was held on Monday, August 30 at Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church, often called \"The Actor's Chapel,\" as it is located on West 49th Street in the Broadway theater district, and has a long association with show-business figures.\nAfter Valentino's remains were taken by train from New York to California, a second funeral was held on the West Coast, at the Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Valentino had no final burial arrangements and his friend June Mathis arranged a temporary solution when she offered a crypt that she had purchased for the husband whom she had since divorced. Coincidentally, she died the following year and was interred in the adjoining crypt that she had purchased for herself; Valentino was never moved to a new location and he remained in the crypt next to Mathis. The two are still interred side by side at Hollywood Forever Cemetery (originally Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery) in Hollywood, California.\nEstate.\nValentino left his estate to his brother, sister, and Rambova's aunt Teresa Werner, who was left the share originally bequeathed to Rambova. His Beverly Hills mansion, Falcon Lair, was later owned by heiress Doris Duke, who died there in 1993. The home was later sold and underwent major renovations. The main building of the estate was razed in 2006, and the property was then put back on the market.\nLegacy.\nAfter Valentino's death, many of his films were reissued to help pay his estate expenses. Many were reissued well into the 1930s, long after the demise of silent film. Several books were written, including one by Rambova. A photo montage print showed Valentino arriving in Heaven and being greeted by Enrico Caruso.\nOver the years, a \"woman in black\" carrying a red rose has come to mourn at Valentino's crypt, usually on the anniversary of his death. Several myths surround the woman, though it seems the first woman in black was actually a publicity stunt cooked up by press agent Russel Birdwell in 1928. A woman named Ditra Flame claimed to be the original \"woman in black\". Several copycats have followed over the years. Although originally a PR stunt, it has become a tradition. The current \"woman in black\" is motion picture historian Karie Bible. This myth of \"woman in black\" was also a source of inspiration for the song \"Long Black Veil.\"\nValentino's hometown of Castellaneta, Italy, has created several services in his honor. The Museo Rodolfo Valentino was opened in his childhood home and a memorial designed by architect Nicola Cantore with a blue ceramic statue of Valentino by Luigi Gheno was unveiled in 1961. \nThe dedication of the memorial is the subject of a vignette in the documentary \"Mondo Cane\". Fondazione Rodolfo Valentino was created to promote his life and his work. In 2009, a film school was also opened in his hometown, Centro Studi Cine Club Rodolfo Valentino Castellaneta. At the 1995 centennial of his birth, several events were held in his honor. From 1972 to 2006, an Italian acting award\u2014The Rudolph Valentino Award\u2014was handed out every year. Several actors from all over the world received this award, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Elizabeth Taylor.\nIn 1994, an opera by Dominick Argento (libretto by Charles Nolte) entitled \"The Dream of Valentino\" was premiered by the Washington National Opera in the District of Columbia . Reviews were not enthusiastic. The opera was revived by the Minnesota Opera in 2014, with similar reviews.\nIn Italy in 2006, a one-off film festival was planned to celebrate the opening of the Museo Rodolfo Valentino. In May 2010, the American Society held the Rudolph Valentino Film Festival in Los Angeles, California.\nValentino's syndrome, the type of medically emergent abdominal pain that caused his death, is named after him. Hollywood High School's mascot, the Sheiks, is a tribute to a Valentino character.\nItalian fashion designer Valentino is named after him.\nFilms.\nThe life of Rudolph Valentino has been filmed several times for television and cinema. A 1951 feature film about Valentino's life, called \"Valentino\", starred Anthony Dexter in the title role. In 1975, American Broadcasting Company produced the television movie \"The Legend of Valentino\", with Franco Nero as Valentino. In 1977, Ken Russell's film \"Valentino\", Rudolf Nureyev portrays Valentino.\nIn the 1977 spoof comedy \"The World's Greatest Lover\", Valentino was played by Gene Wilder.\nIn 1986, the French TV channel FR3 produced the television movie \"S\u00e9rie portrait, Rudolph Valentino\", with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Norbert as Valentino.\nIn 2013, Valentino is played by actor/director Alex Monty Canawati in the motion picture \"Return to Babylon\".\nIn 2015, Valentino is a supporting character in the of the horror anthology series \"American Horror Story\". In the series, Valentino, who is played by Finn Wittrock, fakes his own death in 1926 after being transformed into a vampire. Valentino then turns his fictional lover, Elizabeth Johnson (Lady Gaga), into a vampire, as well. Elizabeth goes on to become the Countess, the central antagonist of the show's fifth season, while Valentino is eventually killed by Donovan (Matt Bomer), one of Elizabeth's many lovers, in a jealous rage.\nIn 2018, Vladislav Alex Kozlov had been set to play Valentino and direct an upcoming indie biopic \"Silent Life\", with Franco Nero playing Valentino's spirit. Written by Vladislav Alex Kozlov, Ksenia Jarova, and Natalia Dar, the film stars Terry Moore, Isabella Rossellini, Franco Nero, Sherilyn Fenn, Jeff DuJardin, Paul Rodriguez, and Monte Markham. Dreamer Pictures, and Vladislav Alex Kozlov produces, and Joy Boileau, Tyler Cassity, and Yogu Kanthiah, executive produce. On 19 February 2023, \"Silent Life: The Story of the Lady In Black\" U.S. premiered at the Sedona International Film Festival.&lt;ref name=\"deadline/1235249623\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nMusic.\nShortly after his death, several songs in tribute to Valentino, including \"There's a New Star in Heaven Tonight\" and one by his first wife, Jean Acker, titled \"We Will Meet at the End of the Trail\", became bestsellers. In 1964, Freddie Hart recorded a ballad titled \"Valentino\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nRecordings\nMetadata"}

Regarded as a pioneer in primate ethology, and described by many publications as \"the world's preeminent chimpanzee expert\", she was best known for more than six decades of field research on the social and family life of wild chimpanzees in the Kasakela chimpanzee community at Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania. Beginning in 1960, under the mentorship of the palaeontologist Louis Leakey, Goodall's research demonstrated that chimpanzees share many key traits with humans, such as using tools, having complex emotions, forming lasting social bonds, engaging in organised warfare, and passing on knowledge across generations, which redefined the traditional view that humans are uniquely different from other animals.\nIn 1965 Goodall was awarded a PhD in ethology from the University of Cambridge. In the 1960s Goodall published several accounts of her research in Tanzania, including a series of articles in \"National Geographic\". Her first book-length study, \"In the Shadow of Man\" (1971), was later translated into 48 languages. She founded the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977 to promote wildlife conservation, followed by the Roots &amp; Shoots youth programme in 1991, which grew into a global network. Goodall also established wildlife sanctuaries and reforestation projects in Africa and campaigned for the ethical treatment of animals in animal testing, animal husbandry and captivity. Goodall was appointed a United Nations Messenger of Peace in 2002, and advised organisations such as Save the Chimps and the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks.\nThroughout her career Goodall wrote 32 books, 15 of them for children, and was the subject of over 40 films. She remained an active lecturer, travelling extensively to promote conservation and climate action. Goodall was an honorary member of the World Future Council. Among other honours, she was a recipient of the National Geographic Society's Hubbard Medal, the Kyoto Prize, the Templeton Prize and the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2003 she was named a dame commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II. Goodall served on the board of the Nonhuman Rights Project from 2022 until her death.\nEarly life.\nValerie Jane Morris-Goodall was born in April 1934 in Hampstead, London, to Mortimer Herbert Morris-Goodall (1907\u20132001), a businessman, and Margaret Myfanwe Joseph (1906\u20132000), a novelist from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, who wrote under the pen name Vanne Morris-Goodall.\nAfter the family moved to Bournemouth, Goodall attended Uplands School, an independent school in nearby Poole.\nWhen she was a child, Goodall's father gave her a stuffed toy chimpanzee named Jubilee as an alternative to a teddy bear. Goodall had said her fondness for it sparked her early love of animals, commenting, \"My mother's friends were horrified by this toy, thinking it would frighten me and give me nightmares.\" Jubilee was still on Goodall's dresser in London as of 2000.\nAfrica.\nGoodall had always been drawn to animals and Africa, which brought her to the farm of a friend in the White Highlands in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, the Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids, was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining approval from his co-researcher and wife, the palaeoanthropologist Mary Leakey, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanganyika (later part of Tanzania), where he laid out his plans.\nIn 1958 Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behaviour with Osman Hill and primate anatomy with John Napier. Leakey raised funds, and on 14 July 1960 Goodall went to Gombe Stream National Park, becoming the first of what would come to be called the Trimates. She was accompanied by her mother, whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety. Goodall credits her mother with encouraging her to pursue a career in primatology, a male-dominated field at the time. Goodall has said that women were not accepted in the field when she started her research in the late 1950s. As of 2019[ [update]] the field of primatology is made up almost evenly of men and women, in part thanks to the trailblazing work of Goodall and her encouragement of young women to join the field.\nLouis Leakey arranged funding, and in 1962 he sent Goodall, who had no degree, to the University of Cambridge. She was the eighth person to be allowed to study for a PhD at Cambridge without first having obtained a bachelor's degree. She attended Newnham College, Cambridge, to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy degree in ethology. Her thesis was completed in 1966 under the supervision of Robert Hinde on the \"Behaviour of free-living chimpanzees\", detailing her first five years of study at the Gombe Reserve.\nOn 19 June 2006 the Open University of Tanzania awarded her an honorary Doctor of Science degree. She became an honorary fellow of both Newnham College (her alma mater) and Darwin College, Cambridge, in 2019, when she was also awarded an honorary doctorate.\nWork.\nResearch at Gombe Stream National Park.\nGoodall studied chimpanzee social and family life beginning with the Kasakela chimpanzee community in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania, in 1960. She found that \"it isn't only human beings who have personality, who are capable of rational thought [and] emotions like joy and sorrow.\" She also observed behaviours often considered human, such as hugs, kisses, pats on the back, and even tickling. Goodall insisted that these gestures are evidence of \"the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years.\"\nGoodall's research at Gombe Stream challenged two long-standing beliefs of the day: that only humans could construct and use tools, and that chimpanzees were vegetarians. While observing one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound, she watched him repeatedly place stalks of grass into termite holes, then remove them from the hole covered with clinging termites, effectively \"fishing\" for termites. The chimpanzees would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification that is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking. Humans had long distinguished themselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as \"Man the Toolmaker\". In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, \"[w]e must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!\"\nGoodall observed the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop to maintain their dominance, sometimes going as far as cannibalism. She said of this revelation,\nDuring the first ten years of the study I had believed [...] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. [...] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal\u2014that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature.\nShe described the 1974\u20131978 Gombe Chimpanzee War in her 1990 memoir, \"Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe\". Her findings revolutionised contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees.\nGoodall found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimpanzees will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as colobus monkeys. Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree and block all possible exits; then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus. The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours. The chimpanzees at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year. This represented a major scientific discovery that challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.\nGoodall set herself apart from convention by naming the animals in her studies of primates instead of assigning each a number. Numbering was a nearly universal practice at the time and was thought to be important in avoiding emotional attachment to the subject being studied and thus losing objectivity. Goodall wrote in 1993,\nWhen, in the early 1960s, I brazenly used such words as 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'motivation', 'excitement', and 'mood' I was much criticised. Even worse was my crime of suggesting that chimpanzees had 'personalities'. I was ascribing human characteristics to nonhuman animals and was thus guilty of that worst of ethological sins\u2014anthropomorphism. \nSetting herself apart from other researchers also led her to develop a close bond with the chimpanzees and to become the only human ever accepted into chimpanzee society.\nAmong those whom Goodall named during her years in Gombe were:\nJane Goodall Institute.\nIn 1977 Goodall established the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI), which supports the Gombe research, and she was a global leader in the effort to protect chimpanzees and their habitats. With nineteen offices around the world, the JGI is widely recognised for community-centred conservation and development programmes in Africa. Its global youth programme, Roots &amp; Shoots, began in 1991 when a group of 12 local teenagers met with Goodall on her back porch in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. They were eager to discuss a range of problems they knew about from first-hand experience that caused them deep concern. The organisation has over 10,000 groups in over 100 countries as of 2010[ [update]].\nIn 1992 Goodall founded the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Centre in the Republic of Congo to care for chimpanzees orphaned due to bush-meat trade. The rehabilitation houses over a hundred chimps over its three islands.\nIn 1994 Goodall founded the Lake Tanganyika Catchment Reforestation and Education (TACARE or \"Take Care\") pilot project to protect chimpanzees' habitat from deforestation by reforesting hills around Gombe while simultaneously educating neighbouring communities on sustainability and agriculture training. The TACARE project also supports young girls by offering them access to reproductive health education and through scholarships to finance their college tuition.\nOwing to an overflow of handwritten notes, photographs, and data piling up at Goodall's home in Dar es Salaam in the mid-1990s, the Jane Goodall Institute's Center for Primate Studies was created at the University of Minnesota to house and organise this data. As of 2011[ [update]], all of the original Jane Goodall archives reside there and have been digitised, analysed, and placed in an online database. On 17 March 2011 Karl Bates, a Duke University spokesman, announced that the archives would be moved to Duke, with Anne E. Pusey, Duke's chairman of evolutionary anthropology, overseeing the collection. Pusey, who managed the archives in Minnesota and worked with Goodall in Tanzania, had worked at Duke for a year.\nIn 2018 and 2020 Goodall partnered with her friend Michael Cammarata on two natural product lines from Schmidt's Naturals and Neptune Wellness Solutions. Five percent of every sale benefited the Jane Goodall Institute.\nAs of 2004 Goodall devoted virtually all of her time to advocacy on behalf of chimpanzees and the environment, travelling nearly 300 days a year. Goodall was also on the advisory council for the world's largest chimpanzee sanctuary outside of Africa, Save the Chimps in Fort Pierce, Florida, United States.\nGoodall was an advisory board member for The Society for the Protection of Underground Networks (SPUN).\nActivism.\nGoodall credited the 1986 \"Understanding Chimpanzees\" conference, hosted by the Chicago Academy of Sciences, with shifting her focus from observation of chimpanzees to a broader and more intense concern with animal-human conservation. She was the former president of Advocates for Animals, an organisation based in Edinburgh, Scotland, that campaigns against the use of animals in medical research, zoos, farming and sport.\nShe was a vegetarian and advocated the diet for ethical, environmental, and health reasons. In \"The Inner World of Farm Animals\" (2009), Goodall wrote that farm animals are \"far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined and, despite having been bred as domestic slaves, they are individual beings in their own right. As such, they deserve our respect. And our help. Who will plead for them if we are silent?\" Goodall also said: \"Thousands of people who say they 'love' animals sit down once or twice a day to enjoy the flesh of creatures who have been treated with so little respect and kindness just to make more meat.\" In 2021 Goodall became a vegan and authored a cookbook titled \"Eat Meat Less\".\nGoodall was an outspoken environmental advocate, speaking on the effects of climate change on endangered species such as chimpanzees. Goodall, alongside her foundation, collaborated with the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration to use satellite imagery from the Landsat series to remedy the effects of deforestation on chimpanzees and local communities in Western Africa by offering the villagers information on how to reduce activity and preserve their environment. To ensure the safe and ethical treatment of animals during ethological studies, Goodall, alongside Professor Mark Bekoff, founded the organisation Ethologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in 2000.\nIn 2008 Goodall gave a lecture entitled \"Reason for Hope\" at the University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice, and in the same year demanded the European Union end the use of medical research on animals and ensure more funding for alternative methods of medical research. She described Edinburgh Zoo's new primate enclosure as a \"wonderful facility\" where monkeys \"are probably better off [than those] living in the wild in an area like Budongo, where one in six gets caught in a wire snare, and countries like Congo, where chimpanzees, monkeys and gorillas are shot for food commercially.\" This was in conflict with Advocates for Animals' position on captive animals. In June that year, she resigned the presidency of the organisation which she had held since 1998, citing her busy schedule and explaining, \"I just don't have time for them.\" Goodall was a patron of the population concern charity Population Matters and as of 2017[ [update]] was an ambassador for Disneynature.\nIn 2010 Goodall, through the Jane Goodall Institute, formed a coalition with a number of organisations such as the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and petitioned to list all chimpanzees, including those that are captive, as endangered. In 2015 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service accepted this rule and classified all chimpanzees as endangered. In 2011 she became a patron of the Australian animal protection group Voiceless. \"I have for decades been concerned about factory farming, in part because of the tremendous harm inflicted on the environment, but also because of the shocking ongoing cruelty perpetuated on millions of sentient beings.\"\nIn 2012 she took on the role of challenger for the Engage in Conservation Challenge with The DO School, formerly known as the D&amp;F Academy. She worked with a group of aspiring social entrepreneurs to create a workshop to engage young people in conserving biodiversity, and to tackle a perceived global lack of awareness of the issue. In 2014 Goodall wrote to Air France executives, criticising the airline's continued transport of monkeys to laboratories. Goodall called the practise \"cruel\" and \"traumatic\" for the monkeys involved. The same year, Goodall also wrote to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to criticise maternal deprivation experiments on baby monkeys in NIH laboratories.\nPrior to the 2015 UK general election, she endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas. She was a critic of fox hunting and signed a letter to Members of Parliament in 2015 opposing the Conservative prime minister David Cameron's plan to amend the Hunting Act 2004.\nIn August 2019 Goodall was honoured for her contributions to science with a bronze sculpture in Midtown Manhattan alongside nine other women, part of the Statues for Equality project. In 2020 she advocated for ecocide (mass damage or destruction of nature) to be made an international crime, stating \"The concept of Ecocide is long overdue. It could lead to an important change in the way people perceive \u2013 and respond to \u2013 the current environmental crisis.\" That same year, Goodall vowed to plant five million trees, part of the one trillion tree initiative founded by the World Economic Forum.\nIn 2021 Goodall called on the European Commission to abolish caging of farm animals.\nIn 2021 Goodall joined the Rewriting Extinction campaign to fight the climate and biodiversity crisis through comics. She is listed as a contributor to the book \"The Most Important Comic Book on Earth: Stories to Save the World\" which was released on 28 October 2021 by DK.\nFeeding stations.\nMany standard methods aim to avoid interference by observers, and in particular some believe that the use of feeding stations to attract Gombe chimpanzees has altered normal foraging and feeding patterns and social relationships. This argument is the focus of a book published by Margaret Power in 1991. It has been suggested that higher levels of aggression and conflict with other chimpanzee groups in the area were due to the feeding, which could have created the \"wars\" between chimpanzee social groups described by Goodall, aspects of which she did not witness in the years before artificial feeding began at Gombe. Thus, some regard Goodall's observations as distortions of normal chimpanzee behaviour.\nGoodall herself acknowledged that feeding contributed to aggression within and between groups, but maintained that the effect was limited to alteration of the intensity and not the nature of chimpanzee conflict, and further suggested that feeding was necessary for the study to be effective at all. Craig Stanford of the Jane Goodall Research Center at the University of Southern California states that researchers conducting studies with no artificial provisioning have a difficult time viewing any social behaviour of chimpanzees, especially those related to inter-group conflict.\nSome studies, such as those by Crickette Sanz in the Goualougo Triangle (Republic of the Congo) and Christophe Boesch in the Ta\u00ef National Park (Ivory Coast), have not shown the aggression observed in the Gombe studies. However, other primatologists disagree that the studies are flawed; for example, Jim Moore provides a critique of Margaret Powers' assertions and some studies of other chimpanzee groups have shown aggression similar to that in Gombe even in the absence of feeding.\nIn an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\" in November 2017, Goodall was asked about the feeding stations and the controversy she received. Goodall acknowledged that she would not continue with feeding stations in present time as \"there was absolutely no knowledge back then that chimpanzees could catch human infectious diseases\".\nOpinions and written works.\nBigfoot.\nGoodall was known to have supported the possibility that undiscovered species of primates may still exist, including cryptids such as Sasquatch, Yeren and other types of Bigfoot. She talked about this possibility in various interviews and debates. In 2012, when the \"Huffington Post\" asked her about it, Goodall replied: \"I'm fascinated and would actually love them to exist,\" adding, \"Of course, it's strange that there has never been a single authentic hide or hair of the Bigfoot, but I've read all the accounts.\"\nReligion and spirituality.\nGoodall was raised in a Christian congregationalist family. As a young woman, she took night classes in Theosophy. Her family were occasional churchgoers, but Goodall began attending more regularly as a teenager when the church appointed a new minister, Trevor Davies. \"He was highly intelligent and his sermons were powerful and thought-provoking... I could have listened to his voice for hours... I fell madly in love with him... Suddenly, no one had to encourage me to go to church. Indeed, there were never enough services for my liking.\" Of her later discovery of the atheism and agnosticism of many of her scientific colleagues, Goodall wrote that \"[f]ortunately, by the time I got to Cambridge I was twenty-seven years old and my beliefs had already moulded so that I was not influenced by these opinions.\"\nIn \"Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey\" (1999), Goodall described the implications of a mystical experience she had at Notre Dame Cathedral in 1977: \"Since I cannot believe that this was the result of chance, I have to admit anti-chance. And so I must believe in a guiding power in the universe \u2013 in other words, I must believe in God.\" When asked if she believes in God, Goodall said in September 2010: \"I don't have any idea of who or what God is. But I do believe in some great spiritual power. I feel it particularly when I'm out in nature. It's just something that's bigger and stronger than what I am or what anybody is. I feel it. And it's enough for me.\" When asked in the same year if she still considers herself a Christian, Goodall told \"The Guardian\": \"I suppose so; I was raised as a Christian.\" She stated further that she saw no contradiction between evolution and belief in God.\nIn her foreword to the 2017 book \"The Intelligence of the Cosmos\" by Ervin Laszlo, a philosopher of science who advocates quantum consciousness theory, Goodall wrote: \"we must accept that there is an Intelligence driving the process [of evolution], that the Universe and life on Earth are inspired and in-formed by an unknown and unknowable Creator, a Supreme Being, a Great Spiritual Power.\"\n\"Seeds of Hope\".\nIn 2013 Goodall wrote the book \"Seeds of Hope\" with Gail Hudson, which examined the critical role that trees and plants play in our world. However, Hachette Book Group did not release the book due to the discovery of plagiarised portions. A reviewer for \"The Washington Post\" had found unattributed sections that were copied from websites about organic tea and tobacco and an \"amateurish astrology site\", as well as from Wikipedia. Goodall apologised and stated, \"It is important to me that the proper sources are credited, and I will be working diligently with my team to address all areas of concern. My goal is to ensure that when this book is released it is not only up to the highest of standards, but also that the focus be on the crucial messages it conveys.\"\nThe book was released on 1 April 2014, after review and the addition of 57 pages of endnotes. After the release, Goodall blamed her \"chaotic note taking\" for the plagiarism accusations and revised the book after the allegations.\nPersonal life.\nGoodall was married twice. On 28 March 1964 she married Baron Hugo van Lawick, a Dutch nobleman and wildlife photographer, at Chelsea Old Church, London. She was known during their marriage as Baroness Jane van Lawick-Goodall. The couple had a son, Hugo (nicknamed \"Grub\"), born in 1967. Goodall and Van Lawick divorced in 1974. The following year, she married Derek Bryceson, a former member of Tanzania's parliament and the director of that country's national parks. Bryceson died of cancer in October 1980. Owing to his position in the Tanzanian government as head of the country's national park system, Bryceson was able to protect Goodall's research project and implement an embargo on tourism at Gombe.\nGoodall stated that dogs, and not the chimps she studied, were her favourite animal. She had been diagnosed with prosopagnosia, which made it difficult to recognise familiar faces. She lived in Bournemouth, England.\nDeath and tributes.\nGoodall died in her sleep of natural causes while staying at the home of a friend in Beverly Hills, California, on 1 October 2025, at the age of 91. She had been on a speaking tour in the United States.\nFollowing her death, tributes were paid by prominent figures including Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex; the former US vice president Al Gore; the former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, the comedian Ellen DeGeneres, the actor Leonardo DiCaprio; and Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nIn October 2025 Netflix released the first episode of \"Famous Last Words\"; in the episode, Goodall was interviewed by Brad Falchuk.\nIn popular culture.\nStevie Nicks's song \"Jane\", written in 1990, celebrates Goodall's life and work. It is the last track on Nicks's 1994 \"Street Angel\" album.\nOn 3 March 2022, in celebration of Women's History Month and International Women's Day, the Lego Group issued set number 40530, \"A Jane Goodall Tribute\", depicting a Goodall minifigure and three chimpanzees in an African forest scene.\nIn 2022 Mattel released a Barbie-themed Goodall doll from recycled plastic in field attire with binoculars and a notebook. According to Mattel, the doll was made in recognition of Goodall's \"decades of dedication, ground-breaking research, and heroic achievements as a conservationist, animal behavior expert, and activist\".\nGary Larson cartoon incident.\nIn 1987 Gary Larson published a \"Far Side\" cartoon of two chimpanzees grooming, in which one discovers a blonde hair and says, \"Conducting a little more 'research' with that Jane Goodall tramp?\" The Jane Goodall Institute called the cartoon an \"atrocity\" in a letter drafted by its lawyers to Larson and his syndicate. Goodall, who was in Africa at the time, later found the cartoon amusing. She went on to name it her favourite depiction of herself in pop culture.\nLarson offered profits from sales of a shirt featuring the cartoon to the Jane Goodall Institute. Goodall wrote the preface to \"The Far Side Gallery 5\", detailing her version of the controversy. She praised Larson's creative ideas, which often compare and contrast the behaviour of humans and animals. In 1988 Larson visited Goodall's research facility in Tanzania. While there, he was attacked by a chimpanzee named Frodo.\nTelevision and film.\n\"The Simpsons\" parodied Goodall in the 2001 episode \"Simpson Safari\", in which the scientist researcher Dr Joan Bushwell was written as an indirect parody of her. She voiced herself on the episode \"Gorillas on the Mast\" in 2019.\nGoodall also voiced herself in \"The Wild Thornberrys\" episode \"The Trouble with Darwin\" where she is portrayed as visiting a chimpanzee sanctuary in Tanzania. The episode was later adapted into a children's book by Kiki Thorpe.\nIn February 2021 Apple TV+ ordered \"Jane\", a live action/animation hybrid educational children's television programme which was created by J. J. Johnson co-produced by Sinking Ship Entertainment and the Jane Goodall Institute based on Goodall's missions. It ran for three series, and Goodall appeared as herself in its twentieth and final episode, which aired on 18 April 2025.\nIn October 2025, following Goodall's death, it was announced that a documentary about her life was being worked on by the filmmaker Richard Ladkani.\nAwards and recognition.\nGoodall received many honours for her environmental and humanitarian work, as well as others.

French troops commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the Papal army and occupied the Papal States in 1796. In 1798, upon his refusal to renounce his temporal power, Pius was taken prisoner and transported to France. He died eighteen months later in Valence. His reign of more than twenty-four years is the fifth-longest in papal history. He was also the longest-ruling pope of the Papal States.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nGiovanni Angelo Braschi was born in Cesena on Christmas Day in 1717 as the eldest of eight children to Count Marco Aurelio Tommaso Braschi and Anna Teresa. His uncle was Cardinal Giovanni Carlo Bandi. His nephew was Romoaldo Braschi-Onesti, the penultimate cardinal-nephew. \nBraschi was baptized in Cesena two days later on 27 December and was given the baptismal name of Angelo Onofrio Melchiorre Natale Giovanni Antonio. After completing his studies in the Jesuit college of Cesena and receiving his doctorate of both canon and civil law in 1734, Braschi continued his studies at the University of Ferrara.\nThe priest.\nBraschi became the private secretary of papal legate Cardinal Tommaso Ruffo, Bishop of Ostia and Velletri. Cardinal Ruffo took him as his conclavist at the 1740 papal conclave and when the latter became the Dean of the College of Cardinals in 1740, Braschi was appointed as his auditor, a post he held until 1753.\nBraschi's skill in the conduct of a mission to the court of Naples won him the esteem of Pope Benedict XIV. In 1753, following the death of Cardinal Ruffo, Benedict appointed Braschi one of his own secretaries. In 1755, the pope appointed him as a canon of St Peter's Basilica.\nIn 1758, putting an end to an engagement to be married, Braschi was ordained to the priesthood. He was also appointed in 1758 Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura and held that position until the following year. He also became the auditor and secretary to Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico, the nephew of Pope Clement XIII. In 1766, Clement XIII appointed Braschi treasurer of the camera apostolica.\nThe cardinal.\nBraschi was a conscientious administrator, which was not good news for some. The latter managed to convince Pope Clement XIV to curb his zeal by promoting him to the cardinalate and accordingly on 26 April 1773 he was made Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Onofrio. For a brief period of time this rendered him innocuous to the less scrupulous. Left without any specific task, Braschi retired to the Abbey of Saint Scholastica, Subiaco, of which he was commendatory abbot.\nPapacy.\nPapal election.\nPope Clement XIV died in 1774 and in the ensuing conclave to choose a successor, Spain, France and Portugal dropped all objections to the election of Braschi, who was one of the more moderate opponents of the anti-Jesuit stance of the late pope.\nBraschi received support from those who disliked the Jesuits and believed he would continue the policy of Clement XIV and maintain the provisions of Clement's brief \"Dominus ac Redemptor\" (1773) which had dissolved the order. On the other hand, the pro-Jesuit Zelanti faction believed him to be secretly sympathetic towards the order and expected him to remedy the wrongs the Jesuits suffered in the previous pontificate. These various expectations would face Braschi after his election with the virtual impossibility of satisfying either side.\nCardinal Braschi was elected pope on 15 February 1775 and took the name \"Pius VI\". He was consecrated bishop on 22 February 1775 by Cardinal Gian Francesco Albani and was crowned that same day by the Cardinal Protodeacon Alessandro Albani.\nFirst actions.\nPius VI first opened a jubilee his predecessor had already convoked, the 1775 Jubilee Year.\nThe early acts of Pius VI gave fair promise of reformist rule and tackled the problem of corruption in the Papal States. He reprimanded Prince Potenziani, the governor of Rome, for failing to adequately deal with corruption in the city, appointed a council of cardinals to remedy the state of the finances and relieve the pressure of imposts, called to account Nicol\u00f2 Bischi for the spending of funds intended for the purchase of grain, reduced the annual disbursements by denying pensions to many prominent people, and adopted a reward system to encourage agriculture.\nSociety of Jesus.\nUpon his election, Pius VI ordered the release of Lorenzo Ricci, Superior General of the Society of Jesus, who was held prisoner in the Castel Sant'Angelo, but Ricci died before the decree of liberation arrived. It is perhaps due to Pius VI that the Jesuits managed to escape dissolution in White Ruthenia and Silesia. In 1792, the pope considered the universal re-establishment of the Society of Jesus as a bulwark against the ideas of the French Revolution, but did not carry this through.\nGallican and Febronian protests.\nBesides facing dissatisfaction with this temporising policy, Pius VI also faced elements of Enlightenment thinking which sought to limit papal authority. Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim, since 1749 bishop of Myriophiri \"in partibus\" and auxiliary bishop and vicar-general to the archbishop-elector of Mainz, wrote under the pseudonym of \"Febronius\", expounding Gallican ideas of national Catholic Churches. Although Hontheim was himself induced (not without public controversy) publicly to retract his positions, they were nevertheless adopted in Austria. There the social and ecclesiastical reforms which had been undertaken by Emperor Joseph II and his minister Kaunitz, as a way of influencing appointments within the Catholic hierarchy, were seen as such a threat touched to papal authority that Pius VI adopted the exceptional course of travelling in person to Vienna.\nThe Pope set out from Rome on 27 February 1782 and, though magnificently received by the Emperor, his mission proved a failure. Nevertheless, not many years later he did succeed in curbing the attempts of several German archbishops at the Congress of Ems in 1786 to win greater independence.\nLiberal opposition.\nIn the Kingdom of Naples the liberal minister Bernardo Tanucci agitated for certain concessions regarding feudal homage due to the papacy and some concessions were made. More serious disagreements arose with Leopold II, later emperor, and Scipione de' Ricci, bishop of Pistoia and Prato, upon the questions of proposed liberal reforms to the Church in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The papal bull \"Auctorem fidei\", issued on 28 August 1794, is a condemnation of the Gallican and Jansenist propositions and tendencies of the Synod of Pistoia (1786).\nOther activities.\nOn 17 August 1775, Pope Pius VI promulgated with a Papal Decree the authenticity of Our Lady of \u0160iluva.\nPius VI saw the development of the Catholic Church in the United States of America. He released the American clergy from the jurisdiction of the Vicar Apostolic in England, and erected the first American episcopal see, the Diocese of Baltimore in November 1789.\nPius VI elevated 73 cardinals in 23 consistories. He canonized no saints during his pontificate but beatified a total of 39 individuals that included Lawrence of Brindisi and Amato Ronconi.\nThe pope also set the Papal States' finances on much steadier ground. Pius is best remembered in connection with the expansion of the Pio-Clementine Museum, which was begun at the suggestion of his predecessor Clement XIV; and with an attempt to drain the Pontine Marshes, but Pius VI did successfully drain the marshes near Citt\u00e0 della Pieve, Perugia, and Spoleto. He also restored the Via Appia. Pius VI also deepened and expanded the harbors of Terracina and Porto d'Anzio, a major center of Pontifical trade. Pius was a great patron of the arts and humanities; he also added a new sacristy to Saint Peter's Basilica.\nFrench Revolution.\nAt the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Pius VI witnessed the suppression of the old Gallican Church as well as the confiscation of pontifical and ecclesiastical possessions in France. He saw the events as a sign of opposition against the social order ordained by God and also viewed it as a conspiracy against the church. The pope condemned both the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and supported a league against the revolution. He issued two briefs \u2013 \"Quod aliquantum\" (1791) and \"Caritas\" (1791) \u2013 to condemn the ecclesiastical reforms that were proposed.\n1791 marked the end of diplomatic relations with France and the papal nuncio, Antonio Dugnani, was recalled to Rome as a result. One of the reasons for the breach was the seizure by the revolutionaries of the Comtat Venaissin, ending 516 years of Papal rule in Avignon.\nKing Louis XVI was executed via guillotine on 21 January 1793, and his daughter Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se petitioned Rome for the canonization of her father. Pius VI hailed the late king as a martyr on 17 June 1793 in a meeting with cardinals, giving hope to a potential possibility of sainthood. In 1820, two decades following the death of Pius VI, the Congregation of Rites put an end to the possible sainthood since it was impossible to prove the king died for religious reasons rather than political ones. Pius VI argued that the main thrust of the revolution was against the Catholic religion and Louis XVI himself. He also wrote that the French revolutionaries abolished \"the monarchy, the best of all governments\".\nArrest and death under Napoleon.\nIn 1796, French Republican troops under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy and defeated the Papal troops. The French occupied Ancona and Loreto. Pius VI sued for peace which was granted at Tolentino on 19 February 1797; but on 28 December 1797, in a riot blamed by papal forces on some Italian and French revolutionists, the popular brigadier-general Mathurin-L\u00e9onard Duphot, who had gone to Rome with Joseph Bonaparte as part of the French embassy, was killed and a new pretext was furnished for invasion.\nGeneral Louis-Alexandre Berthier marched to Rome, entered it unopposed on 10 February 1798, and, proclaiming a Roman Republic, demanded of the pope the renunciation of his temporal authority.\nUpon his refusal, Pius was taken prisoner, and on 20 February was escorted from the Vatican to Siena, and thence to the Certosa near Florence. The French declaration of war against Tuscany led to his removal (he was escorted by the Spaniard Pedro G\u00f3mez Labrador, Marquis of Labrador) by way of Parma, Piacenza, Turin and Grenoble to the citadel of Valence, the chief town of Dr\u00f4me where he died six weeks after his arrival, on 29 August 1799, having then reigned longer than any pope since Saint Peter.\nPius VI's body was embalmed, but was not buried until 30 January 1800 after Napoleon saw political advantage to burying the deceased Pope in efforts to bring the Catholic Church back into France. His entourage insisted for some time that his last wishes were to be buried in Rome, then behind the Austrian lines. They also prevented a Constitutional bishop from presiding at the burial, as the laws of France then required, so no burial service was held. This return of the investiture conflict was settled by the Concordat of 1801.\nPius VI's body was removed from Valence on 24 December 1801 and buried at Rome 19 February 1802, when Pius VI was given a Catholic funeral, attended by Pope Pius VII, his successor.\nReburial.\nBy decree of Pope Pius XII in 1949, the remains of Pius VI were moved to the Chapel of the Madonna below St. Peter's in the Vatican Grottoes. His remains were placed in an ancient marble sarcophagus. The inscription on the wall above the container reads:\n\"The mortal remains of Pius VI, consumed in unjust exile,\nby order of Pius XII were placed fittingly here\nand decorated by a marble ornament most excellent for its art and history\nin 1949\".\nRepresentation in literature.\nA long audience with Pius VI is one of the most extensive scenes in the Marquis de Sade's narrative \"Juliette\", published in 1798. Juliette shows off her learning to the Pope (whom she most often addresses as \"Braschi\") with a verbal catalogue of alleged immoralities committed by his predecessors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born to an aristocratic family in Lucca, prior to being elected pope, he had a long career as a papal diplomat. His papacy was marked by conflicts with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I, his exile from Rome, and the initial preparations for the Third Crusade.\nBorn in Lucca, Ubaldo Allucingoli rose to prominence within the Catholic Church, eventually becoming Pope Lucius III. He was appointed cardinal by Pope Innocent II and served as papal legate in France, Sicily, and other regions. He was involved in negotiating the Treaty of Venice in 1177, and was elected pope in 1181.\nDuring his papacy, Lucius III faced disputes with the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I over the territories of the late Countess Matilda of Tuscany. He also held a synod in 1184 that condemned various heretical groups. In 1185, preparations began for the Third Crusade, but Lucius III died in Verona before they were completed.\nEarly career.\nA native of the city of Lucca, he was born c.\u20091100 (perhaps 1097) as Ubaldo, son of aristocrat Orlando Allucingoli.\nHe had close ties to the Cistercians, but it seems that he never joined the order. Pope Innocent II named him cardinal in December 1138, initially as cardinal-deacon of San Adriano, then (in May 1141) as cardinal-priest of Santa Prassede and sent him as legate to France. Under Pope Eugene III he served as legate to Sicily, and in January 1159 Pope Adrian IV promoted him to Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Velletri. As dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, he was one of the most influential cardinals under his predecessor Pope Alexander III, whom he had consecrated bishop in 1159.\nIn 1177 Allucingoli took part in the negotiation of the Treaty of Venice where an agreement was reached between Alexander III and Emperor Frederick I who had been excommunicated for his support of the successive antipopes Victor IV, Paschal III and Callixtus III. Allucingoli then served as a member of the court of arbitration regarding the \"Terre Matildiche\", (lands formerly held by the late Countess Matilda of Tuscany to which the Church and the Emperor both laid claim), but which reached no definite conclusion.\nPapacy.\nCardinal Allucingoli was elected pope at Velletri in September 1181, taking the name Lucius. He lived at Rome from November 1181 to March 1182, but dissensions in the city compelled him to pass the remainder of his pontificate in exile, mainly at Velletri, Anagni and Verona.\nAt Velletri he received the ambassadors of King William of Scotland who had disputed with Alexander III's candidates to fill a vacancy of the See of St. Andrews. The King appointed his chaplain Hugh, but the canons of the chapter had elected the archdeacon John Scotus. Lucius freed the king from all ecclesiastical censures incurred under his predecessor and agreed to a compromise by which Hugh was raised to the see of St. Andrews and John became Bishop of Dunkeld. In March 1183, as a sign of good will the pope sent the king the Golden Rose. In September of that year he went to Segni to canonize Saint Bruno, who had been bishop of that commune.\nLucius was in dispute with the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I over the disposal of the territories of the late Countess Matilda of Tuscany. The controversy over the succession to the inheritance of the Countess had been left unsettled by an agreement of 1177, and the Emperor proposed in 1182 that the Curia should renounce its claim, receiving in exchange two-tenths of the imperial income from Italy, one-tenth for the Pope and the other tenth for the cardinals. Lucius consented neither to this proposition nor to another compromise suggested by Frederick I the next year, nor did a personal discussion between the two potentates at Verona in October 1184 lead to any definite result.\nDuring the conflict between Frederick I and the papacy, the problem of heresy required a political solution. In 1184, Lucius decreed \"Ad abolendam\" that all \"counts, barons, rectors, [and] consuls of cities and other places\" who did not join in the struggle against heresy when called upon to do so would be excommunicated and their territories placed under interdict \u2013 and declared that these provisions joined the apostolic authority of the church with the sanction of imperial power.\nIn the meantime other causes of disagreement appeared when the Pope refused to comply with Frederick I's wishes as to the Imperial regulation of German episcopal elections which had taken place under the authority of the German-sponsored antipopes, both during and after the recent schism (1159\u20131176), especially as regards an election to the See of Trier in 1183 contested between the papal candidate Folmar of Karden and the imperial candidate Rudolf of Wied.\nIn pursuance of his anti-imperial policy, Lucius declined in 1185 to crown Henry of Hohenstaufen as Frederick I's destined successor, and the breach between the Empire and the Curia became wider on questions of Italian politics.\nIn November 1184 Lucius held a synod at Verona which condemned the Cathars and Paterines, Waldensians, Josephines, Pasagians and Arnoldists, and anathematized all those declared as heretics and their abettors. Contrary to what is often said, he did not institute the Inquisition, which was not created until the reign of Pope Gregory IX in 1234.\nDespite the fulminations of the first three Lateran Councils against married clergy, Lucius wrote in 1184 to the abbot of St. Augustine Canterbury suggesting that the parson of Willesborough should retire and pass the benefice to his promising son, who could then pursue his studies, showing continued papal tolerance of married clergy at this late date.\nDeath.\nIn 1185 preparations began for the Third Crusade in answer to the appeals of King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem. Before they were completed, Lucius III died in Verona.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0"}

He was banished soon after his consecration, but gained permission to return. He was mistakenly classified as a martyr in the persecution by Emperor Valerian, which did not begin until after Lucius' death.\nLife.\nLucius was born in Rome. Nothing is known about his family except his father's name, Porphyrianus. He was elected probably on 25 June 253. His election took place during the persecution which caused the banishment of his predecessor, Cornelius, and he also was banished soon after his consecration, but succeeded in gaining permission to return.\nLucius is praised in several letters of Cyprian (see Epist. lxviii. 5) for condemning the Novationists for their refusal to readmit to communion Christians who repented for having lapsed under persecution.\nVeneration.\nLucius I's feast day is 5 March, on which date he is commemorated in the Roman Martyrology in the following terms: \"In the cemetery of Callistus on the Via Appia, Rome, burial of Saint Lucius, Pope, successor of Saint Cornelius. For his faith in Christ he suffered exile and acted as an outstanding confessor of the faith, with moderation and prudence, in the difficult times that were his.\"\nHis feast did not appear in the Tridentine calendar of Pope Pius V. In 1602, it was inserted under the date of 4 March, into the General Roman Calendar. With the insertion in 1621 on the same date of the feast of Saint Casimir, the celebration of Pope Lucius was reduced to a commemoration within Saint Casimir's Mass. In the 1969 revision Pope Lucius's feast was omitted from the General Roman Calendar, partly because of the baselessness of the title of \"martyr\" with which he had previously been honoured, and was moved in the Roman Martyrology to the day of his death.\nIn spite of what is mistakenly stated in the \"Liber Pontificalis\", he did not in fact suffer martyrdom. The persecution of Valerian in which he was said to have been martyred is known to have started later than March 254, when Pope Lucius died.\nTomb.\nLucius I's tombstone is still extant in the catacomb of Callixtus. His relics were later brought to the church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, along with the relics of Cecilia and others. His head is preserved in a reliquary in St. Ansgar's Cathedral in Copenhagen, Denmark. This relic was brought to Roskilde around the year 1100, after Lucius had been declared patron saint of the Danish region Zealand. According to tradition, there had been demons at large at the Isefjord at Roskilde city, and as they declared that they feared nothing but Lucius' skull, this had to be brought to Denmark, whereupon peace took reign of the fjord again. After the Reformation, the skull was taken to the exhibition rooms of king Frederik III in Copenhagen, where it was on exhibit along with the petrified embryo a woman had carried inside her for 28 years, as well as other monstrosities the king had collected. The skull remained in Roskilde Cathedral until 1908, when it was moved to Saint Ansgar's Cathedral while the property of Copenhagen's National museum.\nPope Lucius' head is among the few relics to have survived the Reformation in Denmark. However the Norwegian researcher \u00d8ystein Morten started wondering if Lucius' skull might have been mixed up with the skull of the Norwegian king Sigurd the Crusader (1090\u20131130). This skull had also been kept in the Danish National Museum collection in the 1800s until it was donated to Oslo University in 1867. Danish experts from the National Museum then studied the skull, using carbon dating which concluded that the skull belonged to a man who lived between AD 340 and 431, nearly 100 years after the death of Lucius in 254. So the skull in question never belonged to Lucius, who died around AD 254. The results also rule out that it may have belonged to the King Sigurd.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He discovered the Independence Lode near Victor, Colorado on July 4, 1891, and became the Cripple Creek Mining District's first millionaire in 1894. He provided to build buildings, improve the street car system, build the first professional ball park, and provided funds to people in need.\nEarly life.\nOn July 22, 1848, Stratton was born in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Stratton's parents were Mary and Myron Stratton. Stratton is a descendant from the Windsor, Connecticut line of the Stratton family. Stratton's mother had twelve children; of four boys, he is said to be the only one who lived beyond childhood. In 1860, Mary and Myron had nine children aged from 22 years to six months of age: Diantha, Harriet, Anna, Winfield, Mary, Virginia, Luella, Jesse and Ada. Stratton was the only male child at that time.\nEducation.\nStratton learned carpentry in his father's shipyards. After he moved to Colorado, he studied geology at Colorado College and studied metallurgy at the Colorado School of Mines in 1874.\nCareer.\nIn August 1872, Stratton worked as a carpenter for $3 a day in Colorado Springs, Colorado area. Stratton joined the Carpenter's Union, and built furniture and homes during the winter, including working on the house of Helen Hunt Jackson and the McAllister House.\nIn 1874, he began prospecting for gold and silver in the summers. He was unsuccessful in San Juan County, Colorado, but he started prospecting in the Cripple Creek Mining District and located the Martha Washington mine, which he sold for $80,000.\nStratton filed a claim for the Independence mine in Cripple Creek, Colorado on July 4, 1891. He used the money from the sale of the Martha Washington mine to work the Independence Mine. He found a gold vein close to the surface worth $3 million in 1893. He earned an average of $1 million each year until 1899, which made him the first millionaire of the Cripple Creek Gold Rush.\nIn 1899, Stratton sold Independence mine for $11 million.\nStratton also had an interest in the Portland mine. Stratton invested in real estate in Denver, Colorado.\nPhilanthropy.\nHe provided the land to build the Colorado Springs City Hall, Mining Exchange building, and Post Office and Federal Courthouse in Colorado Springs. He donated the money for the construction of the El Paso County Courthouse, which is now the Pioneer Museum. He paid for the construction of the Independence Building, where he had an office.\nHe bought the streetcar system that became the Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway and spent $2 million improving it so that it had 36 miles of tracks and 56 cars. The line ended in the southwest park of Colorado Springs at Stratton Park, which Stratton donated to the city. The Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway became one of the best streetcar systems in the country.\nThe Colorado Springs Millionaires played at the city's first professional baseball stadium, which was built by Stratton. It was located at the corner of Cheyenne Boulevard and South Tejon. He donated the money in his estate for the Myron Stratton Home.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mr. Stratton had done for this city and the Cripple Creek district very much what Mr. Tabor had earlier done for Denver. His wise and public-spirited use of the money have entitled him to a place in the public remembrance which will endure for many years.\u2014\u200a\nHe gave money to prospectors or others in need and he paid for schooling for a teen who was a talented violinist and provided all the laundresses in the town with bicycles. After the Cripple Creek fire of 1896, Stratton paid for food and shelter for many left homeless by the fire. He is said to have written a check for $5,000 to \"Crazy Bob\" Womack, the prospector who first discovered gold at Cripple, but was down on his luck. He gave $20,000 to Horace A. W. Tabor when Tabor was broke.\nPersonal life.\nStratton lived a simple life in a wooden house on Weber Street after he became wealthy. He did not seem to have long-lasting relationships with women until he had a short marriage with Zeurah Stewart. She became pregnant before their marriage in 1876. Stratton did not believe that the baby was his child and was often angry and jealous. She returned to her family and the marriage ended. He had a housekeeper for many years named Eliza, with whom he could be brusque. She was called the \"suffering but faithful housekeeper Eliza\" in the \"Gold Rushes and Mining Camps of the Early American West \" book. He became reclusive and eccentric. He drank and read a great deal, but rarely had guests or went out socially.\nStratton was fond of a quote by William Henry Channing, 19th-century religious thinker and part of the Transcendental movement:\nTo live content with small means, to seek elegance rather than\nluxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not\nrespectable, to study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly;\nto listen to stars and birds, to babes and sages, with open heart;\nto bear all cheerfully, do all bravely, await occasions, hurry\nnever; in a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious,\ngrow up through the common. This is to be my symphony.\nStratton lived at 115 N. Weber St. in Colorado Springs. He had failing health due to cirrhosis of the liver and diabetes. By the time he was 43, he was tall, thin and frail with silky white hair. His personal physician Dr. D.H. Rice traveled with him on long journeys because of his poor health.

{"id": "45413", "revid": "84755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45413", "title": "Tribe", "text": "Human social group\nThe term tribe is used in many different contexts to refer to a category of human social group. The predominant worldwide use of the term in English is in the discipline of anthropology. The definition is contested, in part due to conflicting theoretical understandings of social and kinship structures, and also reflecting the problematic application of this concept to extremely diverse human societies. Its concept is often contrasted by anthropologists with other social and kinship groups, being hierarchically larger than a lineage or clan, but smaller than a chiefdom, ethnicity, nation or state. These terms are similarly disputed. In some cases tribes have legal recognition and some degree of political autonomy from national or federal government, but this legalistic usage of the term may conflict with anthropological definitions.\nIn the United States (US), Native American tribes are legally considered to have \"domestic dependent nation\" status within the territorial United States, with a government-to-government relationship with the federal government.\nEtymology.\nThe modern English word \"tribe\" stems from Middle English ', which ultimately derives from Latin '. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it remains unclear if this form is the result of a borrowing from a Romance language source (such as Old French ') or if the form is a result of borrowing directly from Latin (the Middle English plural ' 1250 may be a direct representation of Latin plural ). Modern English \"tribe\" may also be a result of a common pattern wherein English borrows nouns directly from Latin and drops suffixes, including \"-us\". Latin \"\" is held to derive from the Proto-Indo-European compound *\"tri-d\u02b0h\u2081u/o-\" ('rendered in three, tripartite division'; compare with Umbrian \"trifu\" 'trinity, district', Sanskrit \"tr\u00eddha\" 'threefold').\nClassification.\nConsiderable debate has accompanied efforts to define and characterize tribes. In the popular imagination, tribes reflect a primordial social structure from which all subsequent civilizations and states developed. Anthropologist Elman Service presented a system of classification for societies in all human cultures, based on the evolution of social inequality and the role of the state. This system of classification contains four categories:\nTribes are therefore considered to be a political unit formed from an organisation of families (including clans and lineages) based on social or ideological solidarity. Membership of a tribe may be understood as being based on factors such as kinship (\"clan\"), ethnicity (\"race\"), language, dwelling place, political group, religious beliefs, oral tradition or cultural practices.\nArchaeologists continue to explore the development of pre-state tribes. Current research suggests that tribal structures constituted one type of adaptation to situations providing plentiful yet unpredictable resources. Such structures proved flexible enough to coordinate production and distribution of food in times of scarcity, without limiting or constraining people during times of surplus. Anthropologist Morton Fried argued in 1967 that bands organized into tribes in order to resist the violence and exploitation of early kingdoms and states. He wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In fact, there is no absolute necessity for a tribal stage as defined by Sahlins and Service, no necessity, that is, for such a stage to appear in the transit from a single settlement with embedded political organization, to a complex-state structured polity. Such a developmental process could have gone on within a unit that we may conceptualize as a city-state, such a unit as Jericho might have become in its later stages ... tribalism can be viewed as reaction to the formation of complex political structure rather than a necessary preliminary stage in its evolution.\nControversy and usage deprecation.\nThe term \"tribe\" was in common use in the field of anthropology until the late 1950s and 1960s. The continued use of the term has attracted controversy among anthropologists and other academics active in the social sciences with scholars of anthropological and ethnohistorical research challenging the utility of the concept. In 1970, anthropologist J. Clyde Mitchell wrote:\nThe tribe, a long respected category of analysis in anthropology, has recently been the object of some scrutiny by anthropologists ... Doubts about the utility of the tribe as an analytical category have almost certainly arisen out of the rapid involvement of peoples, even in the remotest parts of the globe, in political, economic and sometimes direct social relationship with industrial nations. The doubts, however, are based ultimately on the definition and meaning which different scholars give to the term 'tribe', its adjective 'tribal', and its abstract form 'tribalism'.\nDespite the membership boundaries for a tribe being conceptually simple, in reality they are often vague and subject to change over time. In his 1975 study, \"The Notion of the Tribe\", Fried provided numerous examples of tribes that encompassed members who spoke different languages and practiced different rituals, or who shared languages and rituals with members of other tribes. Similarly, he provided examples of tribes in which people followed different political leaders, or followed the same leaders as members of other tribes. He concluded that tribes in general are characterized by fluid boundaries, heterogeneity and dynamism, and are not parochial.\nPart of the difficulty with the term is that it seeks to construct and apply a common conceptual framework across diverse cultures and peoples. Different anthropologists studying different peoples therefore draw conflicting conclusions about the nature, structure and practices of tribes. Writing on the Kurdish peoples, anthropologist Martin van Bruinessen argued, \"the terms of standard anthropological usage, 'tribe', 'clan' and 'lineage' appear to be a straitjacket that ill fits the social reality of Kurdistan\".\nThere are further negative connotations of the term \"tribe\" that have reduced its use. Writing in 2013, scholar Matthew Ortoleva noted that \"like the word \"Indian\", \"[t]ribe\" is a word that has connotations of colonialism.\" Survival International says \"It is important to make the distinction between \"tribal\" and \"indigenous\" because tribal peoples have a special status acknowledged in international law as well as problems in addition to those faced by the wider category of indigenous peoples.\"\nPresent-day.\nFew tribes today remain isolated from the development of the modern state system. Tribes have lost their legitimacy to conduct traditional functions, such as tithing, delivering justice and defending territory, with these being replaced by states functions and institutions, such as taxation, law courts and the military. Most have suffered decline and loss of cultural identity. Some have adapted to the new political context and transformed their culture and practices in order to survive, whilst others have secured legal rights and protections.\nFried proposed that most surviving tribes do not have their origin in pre-state tribes, but rather in pre-state bands. Such \"secondary\" tribes, he suggested, developed as modern products of state expansion. Bands comprise small, mobile, and fluid social formations with weak leadership. They do not generate surpluses, pay no taxes, and support no standing army. Fried argued that secondary tribes develop in one of two ways. First, states could set them up as means to extend administrative and economic influence in their hinterland, where direct political control costs too much. States would encourage (or require) people on their frontiers to form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses and taxes, and would have a leadership responsive to the needs of neighboring states (the so-called tribes of the United States or British India provide good examples of this). The British favored the label \"aboriginal tribe\" for some communities.\nIndia adopted a republican constitution in 1950, after three years of debate in its Constituent Assembly. During the debate, Jaipal Singh, a member of Munda tribe from Central India advocated for special provisions for the 'Adibasi' -- a translation into Hindi of 'aboriginal'. His arguments proved persuasive. These communities were to have seats in the legislatures and positions in government employment 'reserved' for them. Each of the assembly members prepared a list of communities that deserved special protections. These names were listed in a \"Schedule\" (appendix) to the Constitution. So these came to be called the 'Scheduled Tribes', often abbreviated to ST.\nSecond, bands could form \"secondary\" tribes as a means to defend against state expansion. Members of bands would form more clearly bounded and centralized polities, because such polities could begin producing surpluses that could support a standing army that could fight against states, and they would have a leadership that could co-ordinate economic production and military activities.\nIn the Native American tribes of North America, tribes are considered sovereign nations, that have retained their sovereignty or been granted legal recognition by the federal government.\nYemen is notable as the most tribal nation in the Arab world, largely due to the significant influence of tribal leaders and their deep integration into various aspects of the state. Estimates vary, with approximately 200 tribes in Yemen, although some reports list more than 400. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He built two of London's theatres and a hotel empire, while also establishing an opera company that ran continuously for over a hundred years and a management agency representing some of the most important artists of the day.\nCarte started his career working for his father, Richard Carte, in the music publishing and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English comic opera could be as popular as the risqu\u00e9 French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end he brought together the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan and nurtured their collaboration on a series of thirteen Savoy operas. He founded the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and built the state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre to host the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.\nEight years after opening the Savoy Theatre, Carte built the Savoy Hotel next to it, and later acquired other luxury hotels. In 1891 he erected the Palace Theatre, London (originally called the Royal English Opera House), which he intended to be the home of a new school of English grand opera, but this ambition was not realised beyond the production of a single work by Sullivan, \"Ivanhoe\". Nevertheless, his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, and his careful management of their operas and relationship, created a series of works whose success was unprecedented in the history of musical theatre. His opera company, later run by his widow Helen and then by his son, Rupert, and granddaughter, Bridget, promoted those works for more than a century, and they are still performed regularly today.\nEarly years.\nCarte was born at his parents' house in Greek Street, Soho, in the West End of London on 3 May 1844; he was the eldest of six children. His father, Richard Carte, was a flautist, and his mother was the former Eliza Jones (1814\u20131885); they had eloped, to the disappointment of her father, Thomas Jones, a clergyman. Carte was of Welsh and probably Norman ancestry; D'Oyly is a Norman French name which the biographer Arthur Jacobs emphasises was in this case \"a forename (not part of a double surname)\". To supplement his income as a performer, Carte's father joined the firm of Rudall, Rose &amp; Co., musical instrument makers and music publishers, in 1850. After he became a partner in the business, it changed its name to Rudall, Rose, Carte and Co. and later to Rudall, Carte &amp; Co. The family moved away from Soho when Carte was a boy. He was brought up in their large detached house in Dartmouth Park in north London. His cultured mother exposed her family to art, music and poetry, and young Carte studied the violin and then the flute at an early age. The family spoke French at home two days a week, and his parents often took their children to the theatre.\nHe was educated at University College School from 1856 to 1860. In January 1861, he achieved First Class level in the matriculation examination for University College London, but did not take up the place; in deference to his parents' wishes he joined his father's business, along with his brother, Henry. As the name Richard Carte was by now well known in, and beyond, the musical profession, Carte dropped the use of his own first name and styled himself \"D'Oyly Carte\" or, more formally, \"R. D'Oyly Carte.\" He studied music and composed some pieces, which he dedicated to the actress Kate Terry. He also acted in amateur theatricals.\nCareer.\nTheatrical beginnings.\nBetween 1868 and 1877, Carte wrote and published the music for several of his own songs and instrumental works, as well as three short comic operas: \"Doctor Ambrosias \u2013 His Secret\" (1868), \"Marie\" (1871), and \"Happy Hampstead\" (1876). On tour in 1871 he conducted \"Cox and Box\" by Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand, in tandem with English adaptations of two one-act pieces by Offenbach, \"The Rose of Auvergne\" and \"Breaking the Spell\", in which Carte's client Selina Dolaro starred. Carte's musical talent would be helpful later in his career, as he was able to audition singers himself from the piano.\nDuring the late 1860s and early 1870s, from within his father's firm in Charing Cross and, by late 1874, from a nearby address in Craig's Court, Carte began to build an operatic, concert and lecture management agency. His two hundred clients eventually included Charles Gounod, Jacques Offenbach, Adelina Patti, Mario, Clara Schumann, Antoinette Sterling, Edward Lloyd, Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, George Grossmith, Matthew Arnold, James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. Hesketh Pearson said of Carte: \"His acute business sense was aided by a frank and agreeable manner: he could not only see where money was to be made but how to make it. He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties. ... He knew everyone worth knowing ... and his practical judgement was as sure as his sense of artistry.\"\nFounding his opera company.\nIn 1874, Carte leased the Opera Comique, a theatre off the Strand, where he presented Charles Lecocq's new op\u00e9ra bouffe \"Girofl\u00e9-Girofla\", given in French by the company who had premiered the work three months earlier in Brussels. It did poor box-office business, and had to be closed after two weeks. He followed it with a modest success, \"The Broken Branch\", an English adaptation of Gaston Serpette's \"La branche cass\u00e9e\". Carte announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for the latter: \"It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light Opera.\" \"The Observer\" commented, \"Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine op\u00e9ra bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction\".\nCarte later said it was \"the scheme of my life\" to found a school of high-quality, family-friendly English comic opera, in contrast to the crude burlesques and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time. His experience in writing operettas had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task. He later wrote to the dramatist W. S. Gilbert, \"I envy your position but I could never attain it. If I could be an author like you I would certainly not be a manager. I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art\". Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease.\nIn 1875 Carte became the business manager of the Royalty Theatre, under the direction of his client, the popular singing actress Selina Dolaro who was the licensee of the theatre and star of its production of Offenbach's \"La P\u00e9richole\". To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act comic opera that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called \"Trial by Jury\". Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, \"Cox and Box\", had been revived at the Gaiety Theatre in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create \"Thespis\" in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for \"Trial by Jury\". \"Trial by Jury\", a comic treatment of an English courtroom, was an unexpected hit, outrunning \"La P\u00e9richole\", and becoming the first step in Carte's scheme to establish a new genre of English comic opera.\nIn June 1875 the Royalty closed for the summer, and Dolaro took her company on tour. While \"Trial by Jury\" and \"La P\u00e9richole\" were playing at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in September, Carte met Michael Gunn, a co-owner of the Gaiety. Gunn became a close friend of Carte's, later served as a manager in his theatrical company and was a shareholder and director in his hotel business. Even after the initial production of \"Trial by Jury\" Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French op\u00e9ra bouffe (Offenbach's \"La P\u00e9richole\", and \"La Grande-Duchesse de G\u00e9rolstein\", Lecocq's \"La fille de Madame Angot\" and L\u00e9on Vasseur's \"La Timbale d'argent\"), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (\"Happy Hampstead\" and \"Trial by Jury\"). Carte was the musical director of this travelling company.\nIn February 1877 Carte, organising a company for a provincial tour of a successful London farce, auditioned a novice actress called Helen Lenoir. He engaged her for a small role, but after a few weeks she left the tour and returned to London where she secured an office post in Carte's agency. She gradually assumed a key role in his business affairs and his personal life. Frank Desprez, the editor of \"The Era\", wrote: \"Her character exactly compensated for the deficiencies in his.\"\nEncouraged by the success of \"Trial by Jury\", Carte had been attempting since 1875 to raise money for either a revival of \"Thespis\" or a new piece. In 1877 he finally found four backers and formed the \"Comedy Opera Company\" to produce new works by Gilbert and Sullivan, along with those of other British authors and composers. This allowed Carte to lease the Opera Comique and to give Gilbert and Sullivan firm terms for a new opera. The first comic opera produced by the new company was Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Sorcerer\" in 1877, with a plot involving a tradesmanlike London magician and his patented love potion. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte were able to select their own cast, instead of using the players under contract to the theatre where the work was produced, as had been the case with their earlier works. They chose talented actors, few of whom were well-known stars; Carte's agency provided many of them. The reception of the piece showed that Carte had been right that there was a promising future in family-friendly English comic opera.\n\"The Sorcerer\" was followed by \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" in 1878. It opened to great enthusiasm but within days of the premiere London experienced an unusually strong and protracted heat wave, and business in the ill-ventilated Opera Comique was badly affected. Takings dropped to \u00a340 a night, and Carte's directors in the Comedy Opera Company advocated cutting their losses and closing the show. After promotional efforts by Carte and Sullivan, who programmed some of the \"Pinafore\" music when he conducted a season of promenade concerts at Covent Garden, the opera became a hit. Carte convinced Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879, a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage. Each put up \u00a31,000 and formed a new partnership under the name \"Mr Richard D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company\". Under the partnership agreement, once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each of the three partners was entitled to one third of the profits.\nOn 31 July 1879, the last day of their agreement with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the \"Pinafore\" set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas. Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props. The Comedy Opera Company opened a rival production of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" in London, but it was not as popular as the D'Oyly Carte production and soon closed. Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan. From 1 August 1879, the new company, later called the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, became the sole authorised producer of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan.\nEarly opera successes; property interests.\n\"H.M.S. Pinafore\" was so successful that Carte soon sent two companies out to tour the provinces. The opera ran for 571 performances in London, the second-longest run in musical theatre history up to that time. Over 150 unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone, but because American law then offered no copyright protection to foreigners, Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan were not able to demand royalties from, or to control the artistic content of, these productions. Sullivan commented that in the US there was a belief \"that a free and independent American citizen ought not to be robbed of his right of robbing someone else\".\nTo try to counter this copyright piracy and make some money from the popularity of their opera in America, Carte travelled to New York with the authors and the company to present an \"authentic\" production of \"Pinafore\", beginning in December 1879, as well as American tours. Lenoir made fifteen visits to America in the 1880s and 1890s to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of each of the new Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Beginning with \"Pinafore\", Carte licensed the J. C. Williamson company to produce the works in Australia and New Zealand.\nIn an effort to head off unauthorised American productions of their next opera, \"The Pirates of Penzance\", Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879, prior to its 1880 London premiere. They hoped to forestall further \"piracy\" by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto. They succeeded in keeping for themselves the direct profits of the venture, but they tried without success for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas. \"The Pirates\" was an immediate hit in New York, and later London, becoming one of the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan operas. To secure the British copyright, Lenoir arranged an ad hoc performance at the Royal Bijou Theatre, Paignton, Devon, by the smaller of Carte's two \"Pinafore\" touring companies, the afternoon before the New York premiere.\nThe next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, \"Patience\", opened at the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, usurping \"Pinafore\"'s position as the longest running piece in the series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history to that date. \"Patience\" satirised the self-indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the aesthetic movement was about. Carte told an interviewer at that time that he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.\nCarte had been planning for several years to build a new theatre to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the Savoy Theatre in 1881. It was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).\n\"Patience\" was the first production at the new theatre, transferring there on 10 October 1881. The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front of house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology. \"The Times\" concluded that the theatre \"is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with.\" Carte and his manager, George Edwardes (later famous as manager of the Gaiety Theatre), introduced several innovations at the theatre including free programme booklets, the orderly \"queue\" system with numbered tickets for the pit and gallery (an American idea), tea served at the interval and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services. Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales. The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were premiered at the Savoy, and all their operas came to be known as Savoy operas.\nThe Savoy Hotel, designed by the architect Thomas Edward Collcutt, opened in 1889. Financed by profits from \"The Mikado\", it was the first hotel lit by electric lights and the first with electric lifts. In the 1890s, under its famous manager, C\u00e9sar Ritz, and chef Auguste Escoffier, it became a well-known luxury hotel and would generate more income and contribute more to the D'Oyly Carte fortunes than any other enterprise, including the opera companies. Carte later acquired and refurbished Claridge's (1893), The Grand Hotel in Rome (1896), Simpson's-in-the-Strand (1898) and The Berkeley (1900).\nPeak years for the opera company.\nDuring the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written Carte also produced operas and plays by other writing teams, as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were companion pieces to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Others were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which played the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and the new works extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of \"Patience\" in London and its 100th performance in New York records that, in addition to these two productions of \"Patience\", Carte was simultaneously managing many other projects. These included two companies touring with \"Patience\", two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta \"Olivette\" (co-produced with Charles Wyndham), one with \"Claude Duval\" in America, a production of \"Youth\" running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of \"Patience\", \"Pirates\", \"Claude Duval\" and \"Billee Taylor\" in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia, among other things.\nCarte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights, increasing the works' popularity and the sales of scores and libretti, as well as the rental of band parts. This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the Savoy operas, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur societies \"support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites.\" Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to \"the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas\". The National Operatic and Dramatic Association was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year.\nAfter \"Patience\", Carte produced \"Iolanthe\", which opened in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, he signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months' notice. Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his stockbroker went bankrupt in November 1882 and felt the long-term contract necessary for his security. The Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, \"Effectively, [the contract] made [Gilbert and Sullivan] Carte's employees \u2013 a situation which created its own resentments.\" The partnership's next opera, \"Princess Ida\", opened in January 1884. Carte soon saw that it was running weakly at the box office and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners to write a new opera. The musical establishment was continually exhorting Sullivan to abandon comic opera in favour of serious music, and after he was knighted in 1883, the pressure increased. He soon regretted signing the five-year contract. In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that \"it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.\"\nDuring this conflict and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using a mixture of friendship and business acumen. Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions. Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners between 1879 and 1896. When \"Princess Ida\" closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, for the first time in the partnership's history, a new opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge \u2013 a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.\nCarte produced the first revival of \"The Sorcerer\", together with \"Trial by Jury\", and matinees of \"The Pirates of Penzance\" played by a cast of children, while he waited for his partners to finish writing the new work. This became the partnership's most successful opera, \"The Mikado\", which opened in March 1885. The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan and took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic and \"picturesque\" Far East. \"The Mikado\" became the partnership's longest-running hit, lasting for 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, and supplanting \"Patience\" as the second-longest-running work of musical theatre up to that time. It was extraordinarily popular in the US and worldwide and remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera. The partnership's next opera was \"Ruddigore\", which opened in January 1887. The piece, though a financial success, was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary run of \"The Mikado\". When \"Ruddigore\" closed after 288 performances over nine months, Carte mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas at the Savoy for almost a year. After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a \"lozenge plot\", Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio-comic plot for \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", which premiered in October 1888. The opera ran for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. This was a happy time for Carte, with a long-running opera, new marriage and new hotel and opera house under construction. When Carte asked his partners for a new work, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a \"dramatic work on a larger musical scale\". Gilbert declined but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: the two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a grand opera that Carte would produce at a new theatre he was planning to build to present British grand opera. The new comic opera was \"The Gondoliers\", which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes, with an initial run of 554 performances.\nDuring these years, Carte was not just the manager of the theatre. He was a full participant in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, involved in casting and finding designers; in charge of publicity; directing and hiring designers for the non-Gilbert works, including the many companion pieces (sometimes with the help of assistants); and casting, directing and rehearsing the touring companies, among other duties. According to Henry Lytton, \"Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly just what was wrong.\" The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe and elsewhere. Queen Victoria honoured the company by calling for a Royal Command Performance of \"The Gondoliers\" at Windsor Castle in 1891. Bernard Shaw, writing in \"The World\" in October 1893, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Those who are old enough to compare the Savoy performances with those of the dark ages, taking into account the pictorial treatment of the fabrics and colors on the stage, the cultivation and intelligence of the choristers, the quality of the orchestra, and the degree of artistic good breeding, so to speak, expected from the principals, best know how great an advance has been made by Mr. D'Oyly Carte.\nLater years.\nOn 22 April 1890, during the run of \"The Gondoliers\", Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new \u00a3500 carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte. Gilbert angrily confronted Carte, but Carte refused to reconsider the accounts. Even though the amount of the charge was not great, Gilbert felt that it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that \"I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen\". Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte \"in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial.\" Matters deteriorated further, and Gilbert brought a lawsuit. Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the Royal English Opera House, the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera. Gilbert won the dispute and felt vindicated, but his actions had been hurtful to his partners, and the partnership disbanded.\nCarte's first production at the Royal English Opera House was of Sullivan's only grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\", which opened in January 1891. It played for an initial run of 155 performances, a record for an opera. When it finally closed in July, Carte had no new work ready to play at the opera house, and so it had to close. The opera house re-opened in November 1891 with Andr\u00e9 Messager's \"La Basoche\" at first alternating in repertory with \"Ivanhoe\", and then \"La Basoche\" played alone, closing in January 1892. Carte again had no new opera to present at the house, and the venture soon failed. Sir Henry Wood, who as young man had been r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur for the production, recalled in his autobiography, \"If D'Oyly Carte had had a repertory of six operas instead of only one, I believe he would have established English opera in London for all time. Towards the end of the run of \"Ivanhoe\" I was already preparing \"The Flying Dutchman\" with Eug\u00e8ne Oudin in the name part. He would have been superb. However, plans were altered and the \"Dutchman\" was shelved.\" Carte leased the theatre to Sarah Bernhardt for a season and finally abandoned the project. He sold the opera house at a loss to the impresario Sir Augustus Harris. It was then converted into a music hall, the Palace Theatre of Varieties, and later became the Palace Theatre.\nBecause of the carpet quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no more for the Savoy. When \"The Gondoliers\" closed in 1891, Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre. He turned to old friends George Dance, Frank Desprez and Edward Solomon for his next piece, \"The Nautch Girl\", which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891\u201392. Carte then revived Solomon and Sydney Grundy's \"The Vicar of Bray\", which ran through the summer of 1892. Next came Grundy and Sullivan's \"Haddon Hall\", which held the stage until April 1893. While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.\nGilbert's aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Carte and Sullivan, but the partnership had been so profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came through the efforts of Tom Chappell, who published the sheet music to their operas. In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, \"Utopia, Limited\". While that was being prepared, Carte staged \"Jane Annie\", by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle, with music by Ernest Ford. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.\n\"Utopia\" was Carte's most expensive production to date, but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894. Carte then played first \"Mirette\", by Messager, then \"The Chieftain\", by F. C. Burnand and Sullivan. These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively. The company then toured the London suburbs, and the Savoy was leased to other managements until November, when Carte presented a revival of \"The Mikado\". This was followed in 1896 by \"The Grand Duke\", which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure. \"The Gondoliers\" turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after \"The Grand Duke\", the two men never collaborated again. At the Savoy, Carte produced \"His Majesty\" (1897), \"The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein\" (1897), \"The Beauty Stone\" (1898) and \"The Lucky Star\" (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.\nThough the 1890s brought Carte more disappointments than hits in the theatre, his hotel business prospered and grew. He acquired Simpson's-in-the-Strand and Claridge's Hotel, both of which he entirely rebuilt. There was one grave setback, in 1897, when he had to dismiss his manager, Ritz, and his star chef, Escoffier, for financial misconduct. Carte's choice as successor to Ritz was George Reeves-Smith, manager and part-owner of the Berkeley Hotel. To secure his services, Carte bought the Berkeley in 1900 and promoted Reeves-Smith to be managing director of the whole Savoy Group. Carte had used the same method, a year earlier, to secure a new ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel. He was determined to engage M. Joseph, proprietor of the Marivaux Restaurant in Paris, then at the height of its fame. Carte was seriously ill, but he insisted on being carried to the boat-train. In Paris he bought the Marivaux and returned with Joseph to the Savoy.\nThroughout the later 1890s, Carte's health was in decline, and Helen assumed more and more of the responsibilities for the opera company. She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies. In 1894, Carte had hired his son, Rupert, as an assistant. While Carte was ill, in 1897, Rupert assisted Mrs Carte and Gilbert with the first revival of \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" at the Savoy. The Savoy put on a number of shows for comparatively short runs during this period, including Sullivan's \"The Beauty Stone\", which ran for only 50 performances, in 1898. In 1899, Carte finally had a new success with Sullivan and Basil Hood's \"The Rose of Persia\", which ran for 213 performances. Neither Carte nor Sullivan lived to see the production of the next piece by Hood, \"The Emerald Isle\", for which Edward German completed Sullivan's unfinished score.\nPersonal life.\nCarte was married twice. His first wife was Blanche Julia Prowse (1853\u20131885), the daughter of William Prowse, a piano manufacturer, music publisher and booking agent. As a teenager, she had participated in amateur theatricals with Carte. They married in 1870 and had two sons, Lucas (1872\u20131907) and Rupert. Blanche died of pneumonia in 1885, and in 1888, Carte married his assistant, Helen Lenoir. Their wedding took place in the Savoy Chapel, with Arthur Sullivan as the best man. Rupert received training in an accounting firm and then became his father's assistant in 1894. Lucas, who was not involved in the family businesses, became a barrister. He was appointed private secretary to Lord Chief Justice Charles Russell in 1899 in connection with the Venezuelan boundary arbitration in Paris. He contracted tuberculosis of which he died at the age of 34.\nCarte's London house was at the Adelphi, not far from the Savoy. Passionate about the visual arts as well as the performing arts, Carte invited his friend, the artist James McNeill Whistler, to decorate the house. Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the billiard cloth, and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand. Equally enthusiastic for technological innovation, Carte installed a lift, the first in a private house in England. Around 1890, he bought a small island in the River Thames, between Weybridge and Shepperton, called Folly Eyot, which he renamed D'Oyly Carte Island. He wanted to use the island as an annex to his new Savoy Hotel, but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property. Instead, he built Eyot House, a large house and garden on the island, that he used as a residence and where he entertained guests. In later years, Carte displayed his macabre sense of humour by keeping a crocodile on the island.\nDeath and legacy.\nCarte died at his London home from dropsy and heart disease in 1901, just short of his 57th birthday. He is buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's in Fairlight, East Sussex, near his parents' graves. A memorial service was held at the Chapel Royal of the Savoy, where a memorial stained glass window was later dedicated to him. He left an estate valued at \u00a3250,000.\nCarte was instrumental in bringing the British theatre from its low status in the mid-Victorian age to a position of respectable eminence, with knighthoods for actors, such as Henry Irving, and for dramatists, including Gilbert. Bernard Shaw wrote of Carte's theatrical legacy, \"Mr D'Oyly Carte founded a new school of English comic opera; raised operatic inscenation to the rank of a fine art; and finally built a new English Opera House and made a magnificent effort to do for English grand opera what he had done for comic opera.\" In Carte's obituary, \"The Times\" noted, \"By his refined taste he raised the reputation of the \"mise en sc\u00e8ne\" of the Savoy operas to a very high pitch. He set a high standard\". Beyond this, however, Carte's influence, through the production of the Savoy operas, heavily influenced the course of the development of modern musical theatre.\nCarte was also a prime mover in making hotels respectable and respected: in the words of the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\": \"Led by the prince of Wales [the Savoy] became the meeting place for London high society and the \"nouveaux riches\" of the British empire... [The] food and the ambience lured people from the clubs to dine in public and give great parties there. It allowed ladies, hitherto fearful of dining in public, to be seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms.\"\nCarte left the theatre, opera company, hotels and his other business interests to Helen. Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas. In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to William Greet, overseeing his management of a revival of \"Iolanthe\" and several new comic operas. Rupert became chairman of the Savoy Hotel by 1903, which Helen continued to own. In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre. The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909 the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.\nAt her death in 1913, Helen passed the family businesses to Carte's son, Rupert. He maintained the hotel business, disposing of the Grand Hotel in Rome, but expanding the group in London. The Savoy Group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994. Carte's hotels have remained among the most prestigious in London, with the \"London Evening Standard\" calling the Savoy \"London's most famous hotel\" in 2009.\nRupert D'Oyly Carte refreshed the opera company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, as well as provincial and foreign tours. In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter Bridget D'Oyly Carte. However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became too much for the company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982. Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The wars originated in political forces arising from the French Revolution (1789\u20131799) and from the French Revolutionary Wars (1792\u20131802) and produced a period of French domination over Continental Europe. The wars are categorised as seven conflicts, five named after the coalitions that fought Napoleon, plus two named for their respective theatres: the War of the Third Coalition, War of the Fourth Coalition, War of the Fifth Coalition, War of the Sixth Coalition, War of the Seventh Coalition, the Peninsular War, and the French invasion of Russia.\nThe first stage of the war broke out when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803. After some minor campaigns, Britain allied with Austria, Russia, and several minor powers to form the Third Coalition in April 1805. Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian armies in the subsequent war which climaxed in French victories at Ulm and at Austerlitz, leading to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and Austria being forced to make peace by the end of the year. Britain and Russia remained at war with France. Concerned about increasing French power, Prussia joined Britain and Russia in the Fourth Coalition, which resumed war in October 1806. Napoleon defeated the Prussians at Jena-Auerstedt and the Russians at Friedland, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent by July 1807, and again leaving Britain as France's sole major enemy. Britain was unable to dispute French dominance on the continent but obtained hegemony over the seas after a string of victories including Trafalgar. Russia used the interim peace to resolve wars with the Ottomans, Swedes, and Iranians.\nHoping to isolate and weaken Britain economically through his Continental System, Napoleon launched an invasion of Portugal, the only remaining British ally in continental Europe. After occupying Lisbon in November 1807, and with the bulk of French troops present in Spain, Napoleon seized the opportunity to turn against his former ally, depose the reigning Spanish royal family, and declare his brother as Joseph I the King of Spain in 1808, to the disapproval of the vast majority of the Spanish populace. Spain subsequently joined Britain and Portugal, with the three powers engaging France in the Peninsular War. The diversion of French armies to the large new Anglo-Spanish front led to Austria reentering the conflict and forming the Fifth Coalition in April 1809, principally composed of Austria, Spain, and Britain. At first, the Austrians won a significant victory at Aspern-Essling but they were quickly defeated at Wagram, forcing the imposition of an even harsher peace in October 1809. Britain, Spain, and Portugal remained at war with France.\nConcurrently Russia, unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade, routinely violated the Continental System, prompting Napoleon to launch a massive invasion in June 1812. The resulting campaign was costly for both sides, but ultimately ended in disaster for France and the near-destruction of Napoleon's . French forces retreated from Russian territory by December 1812 and began reconstituting their lost strength. Encouraged by the defeat, Austria, Prussia, and several minor powers joined Russia, Britain, and Spain in a Sixth Coalition and began a campaign against France. The Sixth Coalition decisively defeated Napoleon at Leipzig in October 1813. The allies then invaded France on two fronts: the Russians, Austrians, and Prussians (plus minor allies) invaded France from the east, while the British, Spanish, and Portuguese (plus minor allies) invaded France from the west. Coalition troops captured Paris at the end of March 1814, forced Napoleon to abdicate in April, exiled him to the island of Elba, and restored power to the Bourbons. \nNapoleon escaped from exile in February 1815 and reassumed control of France for around one hundred days, igniting the eponymous conflict. The allies formed the Seventh Coalition, which defeated him at Waterloo in June 1815 and exiled him to the island of Saint Helena, where he died six years later in 1821.\nThe wars had profound consequences on global history, including the spread of nationalism and liberalism, advancements in civil law, the rise of Britain as the world's foremost naval and economic power, the appearance of independence movements in Spanish America and the subsequent decline of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the introduction of radically new methods of conducting warfare. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna redrew Europe's borders and brought a relative peace to the continent, lasting until the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1853.\nOverview.\nNapoleon Bonaparte seized power in a coup on 9 November 1799, establishing a military dictatorship. There are numerous opinions on the date to use as the formal beginning of the Napoleonic Wars; 18 May 1803 is often used, when Britain and France ended the only short period of peace between 1792 and 1814. The Napoleonic Wars began with the War of the Third Coalition, which was the first of the Coalition Wars against the First French Republic after Napoleon's accession as leader of France.\nBritain ended the Treaty of Amiens, declaring war on France in May 1803. Among the reasons were Napoleon's changes to the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Historian Frederick Kagan argues that Britain was irritated in particular by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. Furthermore, Britons felt insulted when Napoleon stated that their country deserved no voice in European affairs, even though King George III was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire. For its part, Russia decided that the intervention in Switzerland indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution of his differences with the other European powers.\nThe British hastily enforced a naval blockade of France to starve it of resources. Napoleon responded with economic embargoes against Britain and sought to eliminate Britain's Continental allies to break the coalitions arrayed against him. The so-called Continental System formed a League of Armed Neutrality to disrupt the blockade and enforce free trade with France. The British responded by capturing the Danish fleet at the Battle of Copenhagen, breaking up the league, and later secured dominance over the seas at the Battle of Trafalgar, allowing it to freely continue its strategy.\nNapoleon won the War of the Third Coalition at the Battle of Austerlitz, forcing the Austrian Empire out of the war and formally dissolving the Holy Roman Empire. Within months, Prussia declared war, triggering a War of the Fourth Coalition. This war ended disastrously for Prussia, which was defeated and occupied at the Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt within 19 days of the beginning of the campaign. Napoleon subsequently defeated Russia at Friedland, creating powerful client states in Eastern Europe and ending the Fourth Coalition.\nConcurrently, the refusal of Portugal to commit to the Continental System and Spain's failure to maintain it led to the Peninsular War and the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition. The French occupied Spain and formed a Spanish client kingdom, ending the alliance between the two. Heavy British involvement in the Iberian Peninsula soon followed, while a British effort to capture Antwerp failed. Napoleon oversaw the situation in Iberia, defeating the Spanish and expelling the British from the Peninsula. Austria, eager to recover territory lost during the War of the Third Coalition, invaded France's client states in Eastern Europe in April 1809. Napoleon defeated the Fifth Coalition at the Battle of Wagram.\nPlans to invade British North America pushed the United States to declare war on Britain in the War of 1812, but it did not become an ally of France. Grievances over control of Poland and Russia's withdrawal from the Continental System led to Napoleon invading Russia in June 1812. The invasion was an unmitigated disaster for Napoleon; scorched earth tactics, desertion, French strategic failures at the Battle of Borodino, and the onset of the Russian winter compelled Napoleon to retreat with massive losses. Napoleon suffered further setbacks: French power in the Iberian Peninsula was broken at the Battle of Vitoria the following summer, and a new alliance began, the War of the Sixth Coalition.\nThe coalition defeated Napoleon at Leipzig in October 1813, precipitating his fall from power and abdication on 6 April 1814. The victors exiled Napoleon to Elba and restored the Bourbon monarchy. Napoleon escaped from Elba in 1815, gathering enough support to overthrow the monarchy of Louis XVIII, triggering a seventh, and final, coalition against him. Napoleon was then decisively defeated at Waterloo on 18 June 1815, and he abdicated again on 22 June. On 15 July he surrendered to the British at Rochefort and was permanently exiled to remote Saint Helena. The Treaty of Paris, signed on 20 November 1815, formally ended the war.\nThe Bourbon monarchy was once again restored, and the victors began the Congress of Vienna to restore peace to Europe. As a direct result of the war, the Kingdom of Prussia rose to become a great power, while Great Britain, with its unequalled Royal Navy and growing empire, became the world's dominant superpower, beginning the \"Pax Britannica\". The Holy Roman Empire had been dissolved, and the philosophy of nationalism that emerged early in the war contributed greatly to the later unification of the German states, and those of the Italian peninsula. The war in Iberia greatly weakened Spanish power, and the Spanish Empire began to unravel; Spain would lose nearly all of its American possessions by 1833. The Portuguese Empire also shrank, with Brazil declaring independence in 1822.\nThe wars revolutionised European warfare; the application of mass conscription and total war led to campaigns of unprecedented scale, as whole nations committed all their economic and industrial resources to a collective war effort. Tactically, the French Army had redefined the role of artillery, while Napoleon emphasised mobility to offset numerical disadvantages, and aerial surveillance was used for the first time in warfare. The highly successful Spanish guerrillas demonstrated the capability of a people driven by fervent nationalism against an occupying force.\nDue to the longevity of the wars, the extent of Napoleon's conquests, and the popularity of the ideals of the French Revolution, the period had a deep impact on European social culture. Many subsequent revolutions, such as the Russian Revolution, looked to the French as a source of inspiration, while its core founding tenets greatly expanded the arena of human rights and shaped modern political philosophies in use today.\nBackground.\nThe outbreak of the French Revolution had been received with great alarm by the rulers of Europe's continental powers, further exacerbated by the execution of Louis XVI, and the overthrow of the French monarchy. In 1793, Austria, the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Kingdom of Naples, Prussia, the Kingdom of Spain, and the Kingdom of Great Britain formed the First Coalition to curtail the growing power of revolutionary France. Measures such as mass conscription, military reforms, and total war allowed France to defeat the coalition, despite the concurrent civil war in France. Napoleon, then a general of the French Revolutionary Army, forced the Austrians to sign the Treaty of Campo Formio, leaving only Great Britain opposed to the fledgling French Republic.\nA Second Coalition was formed in 1798 by Great Britain, Austria, Naples, the Ottoman Empire, the Papal States, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden. The French Republic, under the Directory, suffered from heavy levels of corruption and internal strife. The new republic also lacked funds, no longer enjoying the services of Lazare Carnot, the minister of war who had guided France to its victories during the early stages of the Revolution. Napoleon Bonaparte, commander of the in the latter stages of the First Coalition, had launched a campaign in Egypt, intending to disrupt the British control of India. Pressed from all sides, the Republic suffered a string of successive defeats against revitalised enemies, who were supported by Britain's financial help.\nBonaparte returned to France from Egypt on 23 August 1799, his campaign there having failed. He seized control of the French government on November 9, in a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat, replacing the Directory with the Consulate and transforming the republic into a \"de facto\" dictatorship. He further reorganised the French military forces, establishing a large reserve army positioned to support campaigns on the Rhine or in Italy. Russia had already been knocked out of the war, and, under Napoleon's leadership, the French decisively defeated the Austrians in June 1800, crippling Austrian capabilities in Italy. Austria was definitively defeated that December, by Moreau's forces in Bavaria. The Austrian defeat was sealed by the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville early the following year, further compelling the British to sign the Treaty of Amiens with France, establishing a tenuous peace.\nStart date and nomenclature.\nNo consensus exists as to when the French Revolutionary Wars ended and the Napoleonic Wars began. Possible dates include 9 November 1799, when Bonaparte seized power on 18 Brumaire, the date according to the Republican Calendar then in use; 18 May 1803, when Britain and France ended the one short period of peace between 1792 and 1814; or 2 December 1804, when Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor.\nBritish historians occasionally refer to the nearly continuous period of warfare from 1792 to 1815 as the Great French War, or as the final phase of the Anglo-French Second Hundred Years' War, spanning the period 1689 to 1815. Historian Mike Rapport (2013) suggested using the term \"French Wars\" to unambiguously describe the entire period from 1792 to 1815.\nIn France, the Napoleonic Wars are generally integrated with the French Revolutionary Wars: \"\".\nGerman historiography may count the War of the Second Coalition (1798/9\u20131801/2), during which Napoleon had seized power, as the \"Erster Napoleonischer Krieg\" (\"First Napoleonic War\").\nIn Dutch historiography, it is common to refer to the 7 major wars between 1792 and 1815 as the Coalition Wars (\"coalitieoorlogen\"), referring to the first two as the French Revolution Wars (\"Franse Revolutieoorlogen\").\nNapoleon's tactics.\nNapoleon was, and remains, famous for his battlefield victories, and historians have spent enormous attention in analysing them. In 2008, Donald Sutherland wrote:\nThe ideal Napoleonic battle was to manipulate the enemy into an unfavourable position through manoeuvre and deception, force him to commit his main forces and reserve to the main battle and then undertake an enveloping attack with uncommitted or reserve troops on the flank or rear. Such a surprise attack would either produce a devastating effect on morale or force him to weaken his main battle line. Either way, the enemy's own impulsiveness began the process by which even a smaller French army could defeat the enemy's forces one by one.\nAfter 1807, Napoleon's creation of a highly mobile, well-armed artillery force gave artillery usage an increased tactical importance. Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, could now use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line. Once that was achieved he sent in infantry and cavalry.\nPrelude.\nBritain was irritated by several French actions following the Treaty of Amiens. Bonaparte annexed Piedmont and Elba, made himself President of the Italian Republic, a state in northern Italy that France had set up, and failed to evacuate Holland, as it had agreed to do in the treaty. France then continued to interfere with British trade despite peace having been made and complained about Britain harbouring certain individuals and not cracking down on the anti-French press.\nMalta was captured by Britain during the war and was subject to a complex arrangement in the 10th article of the Treaty of Amiens, where it was to be restored to the Knights of St. John with a Neapolitan garrison and placed under the guarantee of third powers. The weakening of the Knights of St. John by the confiscation of their assets in France and Spain along with delays in obtaining guarantees prevented the British from evacuating it after three months as stipulated in the treaty.\nThe Helvetic Republic was set up by France when it invaded Switzerland in 1798. France had withdrawn its troops, but violent strife broke out against the government, which many Swiss saw as overly centralised. Bonaparte reoccupied the country in October 1802 and imposed a compromise settlement. This caused widespread outrage in Britain, which protested that this was a violation of the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville. Although continental powers were unprepared to act, the British decided to send an agent to help the Swiss obtain supplies, and also sent secret orders to the Cape Colony to prevent a Dutch takeover.\nSwiss resistance collapsed before anything could be accomplished, and, after a month, Britain countermanded the orders to not restore Cape Colony. At the same time, Russia finally joined the guarantee regarding Malta. Concerned that there would be hostilities when Bonaparte found out that Cape Colony had been retained, the British began to procrastinate on the evacuation of Malta. In January 1803, a government paper in France published a report from a commercial agent which noted the ease with which Egypt could be conquered. The British seized on this to demand satisfaction and security before evacuating Malta, which was a convenient stepping stone to Egypt. France disclaimed any desire to seize Egypt and asked what sort of satisfaction was required, but the British were unable to give a response. There was still no thought of going to war; Prime Minister Henry Addington publicly affirmed that Britain was in a state of peace.\nIn early March 1803, the Addington ministry received word that Cape Colony had been reoccupied by the British army, in accordance with the orders which had subsequently been countermanded. On 8 March they ordered military preparations to guard against possible French retaliation and justified them by claiming that it was only in response to French preparations and that they were conducting serious negotiations with France. In a few days, it was known that Cape Colony had been handed over in accordance with the counter-orders, but it was too late. Bonaparte berated the British ambassador Lord Whitworth in front of 200 spectators over the military preparations.\nThe Addington ministry realised they would face an inquiry over their reasons for the military preparations, and during April unsuccessfully attempted to secure the support of William Pitt to shield them from damage. In the same month, the ministry issued an ultimatum to France, demanding a retention of Malta for at least ten years, the permanent acquisition of the island of Lampedusa from the Kingdom of Sicily, and the evacuation of Holland. They also offered to recognise French gains in Italy if they evacuated Switzerland and compensated the Kingdom of Sardinia for his territorial losses. France offered to place Malta in the hands of Russia to satisfy British concerns, pull out of Holland when Malta was evacuated, and form a convention to give satisfaction to Britain on other issues. The Addington ministry denied that Russia had made an offer, and Whitworth left Paris. Bonaparte sent a secret offer where he agreed to let Britain retain Malta if France could occupy the Otranto peninsula in Naples. Such efforts were futile, and Britain declared war on 18 May 1803.\nWar between Britain and France, 1803\u20131814.\nBritish motivations.\nBritain ended the uneasy truce created by the Treaty of Amiens when it had declared war on France in May 1803. The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon's reordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Kagan argues that Britain was especially alarmed by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. The British felt insulted when Napoleon said they deserved no voice in European affairs (even though King George was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire) and sought to censor the London newspapers that were vilifying him.\nBritain had a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses\u2014an irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\" McLynn concludes that it proved to be the right choice for Britain because, in the long run, Napoleon's intentions were hostile to the British national interest. Napoleon was not ready for war, and so this was the best time for Britain to stop them. Britain seized upon the Malta issue, refusing to evacuate the island.\nThe deeper British grievance with Napoleon was his attempts to assume personal control of Europe, making the international system unstable, and forcing Britain to the sidelines. Numerous scholars have argued that Napoleon's aggressive posture made him enemies and cost him potential allies. As late as 1808, the continental powers affirmed most of his gains and titles, but the continuing conflict with Britain led him to start the Peninsular War and the invasion of Russia, which many scholars see as a dramatic miscalculation.\nThere was one serious attempt to negotiate peace with France during the war, made by Charles James Fox in 1806. The British offered to accept French conquests on the continent in exchange for France recognising British overseas conquests and restoring Hanover to George III. The French were willing to recognise Britain's control over Malta, the Cape Colony, Tobago, and French India but wanted to obtain Sicily in exchange for the restoration of Hanover, a condition which Fox's delegation refused.\nUnlike its many coalition partners, Britain remained at war during the period of the Napoleonic Wars. Protected by naval supremacy (in the alleged words of Admiral Jervis to the House of Lords \"I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea\"), Britain did not have to spend the entire war defending itself and could thus focus on supporting its embattled allies, maintaining low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade. The British government paid out a large amount of money to other European states so that they could pay armies in the field against France. These payments are colloquially known as the Golden Cavalry of St George. The British Army provided long-term support to the Spanish rebellion in the Peninsular War of 1808\u20131814, assisted by Spanish guerrilla ('little war') tactics. Anglo-Portuguese forces under Arthur Wellesley supported the Spanish, who campaigned successfully against the French armies, eventually driving them from Spain and allowing Britain to invade southern France. By 1815, the British Army played the central role in the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.\nBeyond minor actions against French imperial interests, the Napoleonic Wars were much less global in their scope than preceding conflicts such as the Seven Years' War, which historians term a \"world war\".\nEconomic warfare.\nIn response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on 16 May 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree on November 21, 1806, which brought into effect the Continental System. This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from Britain by closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Britain maintained a standing army of 220,000 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, of whom less than 50% were available for campaigning. The rest were necessary for garrisoning Ireland and the colonies and providing security for Britain. France's strength peaked at around 2,500,000 full-time and part-time soldiers including several hundred thousand National Guardsmen whom Napoleon could draft into the military if necessary. Both nations enlisted large numbers of sedentary militia who were unsuited for campaigning and were mostly employed to release regular forces for active duty.\nThe Royal Navy disrupted France's extra-continental trade by seizing and threatening French shipping and colonial possessions, but could do nothing about France's trade with the major continental economies, and posed little threat to French territory in Europe. France's population and agricultural capacity greatly outstripped Britain's. Britain had the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade. This ensured that France could never consolidate its control over Europe in peace. Many in the French government believed that cutting Britain off from the Continent would end its economic influence over Europe and isolate it.\nFinancing the war.\nA key element in British success was its ability to mobilise the nation's industrial and financial resources, and apply them to defeating France. Though the UK had a population of approximately 16\u00a0million against France's 30\u00a0million, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for many of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 men in 1813. Under the Anglo\u2013Russian agreement of 1803, Britain paid a subsidy of \u00a31.5\u00a0million for every 100,000 Russian soldiers in the field.\nBritish national output continued to be strong, and the well-organised business sector channeled products into what the military needed. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates, adding 50 per cent more large ships of the line, and increasing the number of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France saw its navy shrink by more than half. The smuggling of finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to weaken the British economy by cutting off markets. Subsidies to Russia and Austria kept them in the war. The British budget in 1814 reached \u00a398\u00a0million, including \u00a310\u00a0million for the Royal Navy, \u00a340\u00a0million for the army, \u00a310\u00a0million for the allies, and \u00a338\u00a0million as interest on the national debt, which had soared to \u00a3679\u00a0million, more than double the GDP. This debt was supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and taxpayers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax. The cost of the war amounted to \u00a3831\u00a0million. In contrast, the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.\nFrom London in 1813 to 1815, Nathan Mayer Rothschild was crucial in almost single-handedly financing the British war effort, organising the shipment of bullion to the Duke of Wellington's armies across Europe, as well as arranging the payment of British financial subsidies to their continental allies.\nWar of the Third Coalition, 1805.\nBritain gathered allies to form the Third Coalition against The French Empire after Napoleon was self-proclaimed as emperor. In response, Napoleon seriously considered an invasion of Great Britain, massing 180,000 troops at Boulogne. Before he could invade, he needed to achieve naval superiority\u2014or at least to pull the British fleet away from the English Channel. A complex plan to distract the British by threatening their possessions in the West Indies failed when a Franco-Spanish fleet under Admiral Villeneuve turned back after an indecisive action off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805. The Royal Navy blockaded Villeneuve in C\u00e1diz until he left for Naples on 19 October; the British squadron caught and overwhelmingly defeated a Franco-Spanish fleet in the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October (the British commander, Lord Nelson, died in the battle). Napoleon never again had the opportunity to challenge the British at sea, nor to threaten an invasion. He again turned his attention to the enemies on the Continent.\nIn April 1805, Britain and Russia signed a treaty with the aim of removing the French from the Batavian Republic (roughly present-day Netherlands) and the Swiss Confederation. Austria joined the alliance after the annexation of Genoa (Ligurian Republic) and the proclamation of Napoleon as King of Italy on 17 March 1805. Sweden, which had already agreed to lease Swedish Pomerania as a military base for British troops against France, entered the coalition on 9 August.\nThe Austrians began the war by invading Bavaria on 8 September 1805 with an army of about 72,000 under Karl Mack von Leiberich, and the French army marched out from Boulogne in late July 1805 to confront them. At Ulm (25 September \u2013 20 October) Napoleon surrounded Mack's army, forcing its surrender without significant losses.\nWith the main Austrian army north of the Alps defeated (another army under Archduke Charles fought against Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na's French army in Italy), Napoleon occupied Vienna on 13 November. Far from his supply lines, he faced a larger Austro\u2013Russian army under the command of Mikhail Kutuzov, with Emperor Alexander I of Russia personally present. On 2 December, Napoleon crushed the Austro\u2013Russian force in Moravia at Austerlitz (usually considered his greatest victory). He inflicted 25,000 casualties on a numerically superior enemy army while sustaining fewer than 7,000 in his own force.\nAustria signed the Treaty of Pressburg (26 December 1805) and left the coalition. The treaty required the Austrians to give up Venetia to the French-dominated Kingdom of Italy and the Tyrol to Bavaria. With the withdrawal of Austria from the war, stalemate ensued. Napoleon's army had a record of continuous unbroken victories on land, but the full force of the Russian army had not yet come into play. Napoleon had now consolidated his hold on France, had taken control of Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and most of Western Germany and northern Italy. His admirers say that Napoleon wanted to stop now, but was forced to continue in order to gain greater security from the countries that refused to accept his conquests. Esdaile rejects that explanation and instead says that it was a good time to stop expansion, for the major powers were ready to accept Napoleon as he was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;in 1806 both Russia and Britain had been positively eager to make peace, and they might well have agreed to terms that would have left the Napoleonic imperium almost completely intact. As for Austria and Prussia, they simply wanted to be left alone. To have secured a compromise peace, then, would have been comparatively easy. But Napoleon was prepared to make no concessions.\nWar of the Fourth Coalition, 1806\u20131807.\nWithin months of the collapse of the Third Coalition, the Fourth Coalition (1806\u20131807) against France was formed by Britain, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden. In July 1806, Napoleon formed the Confederation of the Rhine out of the many small German states which constituted the Rhineland and most other western parts of Germany. He amalgamated many of the smaller states into larger electorates, duchies, and kingdoms to make the governance of non-Prussian Germany smoother. Napoleon elevated the rulers of the two largest Confederation states, Saxony and Bavaria, to the status of kings.\nIn August 1806, the Prussian king, Frederick William III, decided to go to war independently of any other great power. The army of Russia, a Prussian ally, in particular, was too far away to assist. On October 8, 1806, Napoleon unleashed all the French forces east of the Rhine into Prussia. Napoleon defeated a Prussian army at Jena (14 October 1806), and Davout defeated another at Auerst\u00e4dt on the same day. 160,000 French soldiers (increasing in number as the campaign went on) attacked Prussia, moving with such speed that they destroyed the entire Prussian Army as an effective military force. Out of 250,000 troops, the Prussians sustained 25,000 casualties, lost a further 150,000 as prisoners, 4,000 artillery pieces, and over 100,000 muskets. At Jena, Napoleon had fought only a detachment of the Prussian force. The battle at Auerst\u00e4dt involved a single French corps defeating the bulk of the Prussian army. Napoleon entered Berlin on 27 October 1806. He visited the tomb of Frederick the Great and instructed his marshals to remove their hats there, saying, \"If he were alive we wouldn't be here today\". Napoleon had taken only 19 days from beginning his attack on Prussia to knock it out of the war with the capture of Berlin and the destruction of its principal armies at Jena and Auerst\u00e4dt. Saxony abandoned Prussia, and together with small states from north Germany, allied with France.\nIn the next stage of the war, the French drove Russian forces out of Poland and employed many Polish and German soldiers in several sieges in Silesia and Pomerania, with the assistance of Dutch and Italian soldiers in the latter case. Napoleon then turned north to confront the remainder of the Russian army and to try to capture the temporary Prussian capital at K\u00f6nigsberg. A tactical draw at Eylau (7\u20138 February 1807), followed by capitulation at Danzig (24 May 1807) and the Battle of Heilsberg (10 June 1807), forced the Russians to withdraw further north. Napoleon decisively beat the Russian army at Friedland (14 June 1807), following which Alexander had to make peace with Napoleon at Tilsit (7 July 1807). In Germany and Poland, new Napoleonic client states, such as the Kingdom of Westphalia, Duchy of Warsaw, and Republic of Danzig, were established. Early that same year, the French besieged the fortified town of Kolberg, which resulted in a lifting of the siege by a peace treaty on 2 July.\nBy September, Marshal Guillaume Brune completed the occupation of Swedish Pomerania, allowing the Swedish army to withdraw with all its munitions of war.\nScandinavia and Finland.\nBritain's first response to Napoleon's Continental System was to launch a major naval attack against Denmark. Although ostensibly neutral, Denmark was under heavy French and Russian pressure to pledge its fleet to Napoleon. London could not take the chance of ignoring the Danish threat. In August 1807, the Royal Navy besieged and bombarded Copenhagen, leading to the capture of the Dano\u2013Norwegian fleet, and assuring use of the sea lanes in the North and Baltic seas for the British merchant fleet. Denmark joined the war on the side of France, but without a fleet it had little to offer, beginning an engagement in a naval guerrilla war in which small gunboats attacked larger British ships in Danish and Norwegian waters. Denmark also committed themselves to participate in a war against Sweden together with France and Russia.\nAt Tilsit, Napoleon and Alexander had agreed that Russia should force Sweden to join the Continental System, which led to a Russian invasion of Finland in February 1808, followed by a Danish declaration of war in March. Napoleon also sent an auxiliary corps, consisting of troops from France, Spain and Holland, led by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, to Denmark to participate in the invasion of Sweden. But British naval superiority prevented the armies from crossing the \u00d8resund strait, and the war came mainly to be fought along the Swedish\u2013Norwegian border. At the Congress of Erfurt (September\u2013October 1808), France and Russia further agreed on the division of Sweden into two parts separated by the Gulf of Bothnia, where the eastern part became the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland. British voluntary attempts to assist Sweden with humanitarian aid remained limited, and did not prevent Sweden from adopting a more Napoleon-friendly policy.\nThe war between Denmark and Britain effectively finished with a British victory at the Battle of Lyng\u00f8r in 1812, involving the destruction of the last large Dano\u2013Norwegian ship\u2014the frigate \"Najaden\".\nPoland.\nIn 1807, Napoleon created a powerful outpost of his empire in Central Europe. Poland had recently been partitioned by its three neighbours, but Napoleon created the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, which depended on France from the beginning. The duchy consisted of lands seized by Austria and Prussia; its Grand Duke was Napoleon's ally King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, but Napoleon appointed the intendants who administered the country. The population of 4.3\u00a0million was released from occupation and, by 1814, sent about 200,000 men to Napoleon's armies. That included about 90,000 who marched with him to Moscow; few marched back. The Russians strongly opposed any move towards an independent Poland and one reason Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 was to punish them. The Grand Duchy was absorbed into the Russian Empire as a semi-autonomous Congress Poland in 1815; Poland did not become a sovereign state again until 1918, following the collapse of the neighbouring Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian Empires in the aftermath of World War I. Napoleon's impact on Poland was significant, including the Napoleonic legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle-class bureaucracies.\nPeninsular War, 1808\u20131814.\nThe Iberian conflict began when Portugal continued trade with Britain, despite French restrictions. When Spain failed to maintain the Continental System, the uneasy Spanish alliance with France ended in all but name. French troops gradually encroached on Spanish territory until they occupied Madrid, and installed a client monarchy. This provoked an explosion of popular rebellions across Spain. Heavy British involvement soon followed.\nAfter defeats in Spain suffered by France, Napoleon took charge and enjoyed success, retaking Madrid, defeating the Spanish, and forcing a withdrawal of the heavily out-numbered British army from the Iberian Peninsula (Battle of Corunna, 16 January 1809). But when he left, the guerrilla war against his forces in the countryside continued to tie down great numbers of troops. The outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition prevented Napoleon from successfully wrapping up operations against British forces by necessitating his departure for Austria, and he never returned to the Peninsular theatre. The British then sent in a fresh army under Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington). For a time, the British and Portuguese remained restricted to the area around Lisbon (behind their impregnable Lines of Torres Vedras), while their Spanish allies were besieged in C\u00e1diz.\nThe Peninsular war proved a major disaster for France. Napoleon did well when he was in direct charge, but severe losses followed his departure, as he severely underestimated how much manpower would be needed. The effort in Spain was a drain on money, manpower and prestige. Historian David Gates called it the \"Spanish ulcer\". Napoleon realised it had been a disaster for his cause, writing later, \"That unfortunate war destroyed me ... All the circumstances of my disasters are bound up in that fatal knot.\"\nThe Peninsular campaigns witnessed 60 major battles and 30 major sieges, more than any other of the Napoleonic conflicts, and lasted over six years, far longer than any of the others. France and her allies lost at least 91,000 killed in action and 237,000 wounded in the peninsula. From 1812, the Peninsular War merged with the War of the Sixth Coalition.\nWar of the Fifth Coalition, 1809.\nThe Fifth Coalition (1809) of Britain and Austria against France formed as Britain engaged in the Peninsular War in Spain and Portugal. The sea became a major theatre of war against Napoleon's allies. Austria, previously an ally of France, took the opportunity to attempt to restore its imperial territories in Germany as held prior to Austerlitz. During the time of the Fifth Coalition, the Royal Navy won a succession of victories in the French colonies. On land the major battles included Battles of Raszyn, Eckmuhl, Raab, Aspern-Essling, and Wagram.\nOn land, the Fifth Coalition attempted few extensive military endeavours. One, the Walcheren Expedition of 1809, involved a dual effort by the British Army and the Royal Navy to relieve Austrian forces under intense French pressure. It ended in disaster after the Army commander, John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, failed to capture the objective, the naval base of French-controlled Antwerp. For the most part of the years of the Fifth Coalition, British military operations on land (apart from the Iberian Peninsula) remained restricted to hit-and-run operations executed by the Royal Navy, which dominated the sea after having beaten down almost all substantial naval opposition from France and its allies and blockading what remained of France's naval forces in heavily fortified French-controlled ports. These rapid-attack operations were aimed mostly at destroying blockaded French naval and mercantile shipping and the disruption of French supplies, communications, and military units stationed near the coasts. Often, when British allies attempted military actions within several dozen miles or so of the sea, the Royal Navy would arrive, land troops and supplies, and aid the coalition's land forces in a concerted operation. Royal Navy ships even provided artillery support against French units when fighting strayed near enough to the coastline. The ability and quality of the land forces governed these operations. For example, when operating with inexperienced guerrilla forces in Spain, the Royal Navy sometimes failed to achieve its objectives because of the lack of manpower that the Navy's guerrilla allies had promised to supply.\nAustria achieved some initial victories against the thinly spread army of Marshal Berthier. Napoleon left Berthier with only 170,000 men to defend France's entire eastern frontier (in the 1790s, 800,000 men had carried out the same task, but holding a much shorter front).\nIn the east, the Austrians drove into the Duchy of Warsaw but did not achieve their objectives at the Battle of Raszyn on 19 April 1809. The Army of the Duchy of Warsaw captured West Galicia following its earlier success. Napoleon assumed personal command and bolstered the army for a counter-attack on Austria. After a few small battles, the well-run campaign forced the Austrians to withdraw from Bavaria, and Napoleon advanced into Austria. His hurried attempt to cross the Danube resulted in the major Battle of Aspern-Essling (22 May 1809) \u2013 Napoleon's first significant tactical defeat. But the Austrian commander, Archduke Charles, failed to follow up on his indecisive victory, allowing Napoleon to prepare and seize Vienna in early July. He defeated the Austrians at Wagram, on 5\u20136 July. (It was during the middle of that battle that Marshal Bernadotte was stripped of his command after retreating contrary to Napoleon's orders. Shortly thereafter, Bernadotte took up the offer from Sweden to fill the vacant position of Crown Prince there. Later he actively participated in wars against his former Emperor.)\nThe War of the Fifth Coalition ended with the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn (14 October 1809). In the east, only the Tyrolese rebels led by Andreas Hofer continued to fight the French-Bavarian army until finally defeated in November 1809. In the west, the Peninsular War continued. Economic warfare between Britain and France continued: The British continued a naval blockade of French-controlled territory. Due to military shortages and lack of organisation in French territory, many breaches of the Continental System occurred and the French Continental System was largely ineffective and did little economic damage to Great Britain. Both sides entered further conflicts in attempts to enforce their blockade. As Napoleon realised that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries; the British fought the United States in the War of 1812 (1812\u20131815).\nIn 1810, the French Empire reached its greatest extent. Napoleon married Marie-Louise, an Austrian Archduchess, with the aim of ensuring a more stable alliance with Austria and of providing the Emperor with an heir (something his first wife, Jos\u00e9phine, had failed to do). As well as the French Empire, Napoleon controlled the Swiss Confederation, the Confederation of the Rhine, the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Italy. Territories allied with the French included:\nand Napoleon's former enemies, Sweden, Prussia and Austria.\nSubsidiary wars.\nThe Napoleonic Wars were the direct cause of wars in the Americas and elsewhere.\nSerbian Revolution.\nThe Serbian Revolution coincided with the Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812) (in which the French diplomat, Horace Fran\u00e7ois Bastien S\u00e9bastiani de La Porta played a very important role in provoking the war), which were a proxy conflict of the Coalition Wars, having most of the time Serbs revolutionaries the support of the Russian Empire, while the Ottoman Empire was an ally of the French Empire. This was due to the fact that both empires feared Napoleon's moves to the east as the subsequent Peace of Pressburg brought France into Balkan affairs. The most radical and liberal rebels were also inspired in some way by the French Revolution (specially the rise of nationalism) and the autonomy of the Illyrian Provinces (Serbs initially felt that French presence in the region could have developed into military aid in support of the insurrection against Ottoman rule as a sister republic, but Napoleon didn't want to increase Russian or Austrian influence in the region).\nDuring the first phase, from 1804 to 1806, it was a conservative reaction to new abuses by the Janissaries and Dahis, after they killed Hadji Mustafa Pasha (vizier of the Sanjak of Smederevo). He had created a militia of Serbs fighting the Janissaries that were expelled from Belgrade and had found refuge with Osman Pazvanto\u011flu, governor of the Sanjak of Vidin (in present-day Bulgaria), who pursued his own policy and sought independence, which brought him into conflict with the Serbs and later with the Sublime Porte. The Janissaries managed to return to Belgrade and realized the Slaughter of the Knezes. Thus, the Serbs appealed to Sultan Selim III for assistance against the Dahis, who had since rejected the authority of the Porte. Also, Kara\u0111or\u0111e negotiated with the Austrian captain Sajtinski. At this meeting, he expressed the wish of the Serbian people that the Austrian Empire receive them as a kingdom under its protection like in the past, as occupation of 1788\u20131791 was still a fresh memory. However, the Austrian authorities, due to difficulties with Napoleon and because they wanted to maintain their neutrality in order to be correct with the Porte, could not accept his offers. So, the Serbs were forced to ask for the protection of the Russians, and therefore, on May 3, 1804, the Serb leaders sent a letter to the Russian envoy in Constantinople, in which they spoke of the problems and wishes of the Serbian people, but they also stressed that they would continue to be loyal to the Sultan. Due to the recent Russo-Ottoman alliance against France's expanding influence in the Balkans (the approach of French troops to the Turkish territories, like occupation of Corfu and other Ionian islands in 1797\u201399, influenced the Porte to conclude an alliance with Russia in 1798), the Russian government had a neutral policy toward the Serbian revolt until summer 1804, in which the goal was now to having Constantinople recognize Russia as the guarantor of peace in the region.\nIn 1806, the Serbs rejected I\u010dko's Peace (the Ottomans seemed ready to grant Serbia autonomy, similar to that enjoyed by neighbouring Wallachia, in order to enter in the Napoleonic Wars as an ally of the French) as they desired Russian support for their independence, starting a new phase of the uprising in which the Serbs planned to create their own national state, which would also include the territories of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the pashaliks of Vidin, Nis, Leskovac, and Pazar. Also, in the Traditionalist circles of Serbian rebels, Petar I of Montenegro developed a plan in 1807 to restore the medieval Serbian Empire (\"Slaveno\u2013Serb empire\"), consisting on unify Podgorica, Spu\u017e, \u017dabljak, the Bay of Kotor, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dubrovnik and Dalmatia with Montenegro, which he informed the Russian court and was also viewed by Habsburg Serb metropolitan Stefan Stratimirovi\u0107. The title of Emperor of the Serbs would be held by the Russian emperor as Tsar, but with the condition that Russians respected the independence-autocephaly of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. So, in February 1807, Petar I planned an invasion of Herzegovina by Montenegrin forces and asked for Kara\u0111or\u0111e's aid, wanting to connect the territory occupied by the Serbian rebel forces and Montenegro, which succeeded after the Battle of Suvodol in 1809. This support of Montenegro for the Serbs was reinforced due to the fact that in the war of 1806\u20131812, Ottoman troops, supported by French detachments on Illyria, attacked Montenegro along the entire border, and the Montenegrins did not have time to repel all the attacks. However, they managed to force the French troops to withdraw from Dubrovnik and conquered the Bay of Kotor. Napoleon himself offered Petar I the title \"Patriarch of the entire Serbian nation or of the entire Illyricum\" on the condition that he cease cooperation with Russia and accept a French protectorate, which he refused for fear of an eventual papal status jurisdiction or an Anti-clerical policy.\nHowever, the Treaty of Tilsit between France and Russia against the Ottomans helped put a stop to hostilities in the Balkans, with a truce taking place (which was perceived extremely negatively in Serbia, despite the fact that the truce did not apply to the Serb rebels). Also, there was a secret clause that provided for the division of Turkish possessions in the Balkans between Russia and France and the cancellation of the Slaveno-Serb empire project. In 1809, Kara\u0111or\u0111e appealed to an alliance with the Habsburgs and Napoleon, with no success, even wrote personally to Napoleon seeking military assistance, and in 1810, dispatched an emissary to the French Empire. However, the French did not believe that the rebels had the military capacity to defeat the Ottomans or expulse them from the Balkans. In 1812, under pressure from Napoleon, Russia was forced to sign the Treaty of Bucharest, which restored peace with the Ottomans. One of the clauses of the treaty provided for the maintenance of Serbian autonomy, also, a truce was signed according to the Article 8 of the Treaty. Then, the Russians encouraged Kara\u0111or\u0111e and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte.\nWar of 1812.\nThe War of 1812 coincided with the War of the Sixth Coalition. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, while Europeans often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. The United States declared war on Britain due to a variety of reasons, including British support for Native Americans resisting US settler expansion, interference with American merchant shipping, the impressment of Royal Navy deserters from US merchantmen and expansionist American desires to occupy Canada. France had interfered with American shipping as well, and the United States had considered declaring war on France. The war ended in a military stalemate, and there were no boundary changes at the Treaty of Ghent, which took effect in early 1815 when Napoleon was on Elba.\nLatin American Revolutions.\nThe abdication of Kings Charles IV of Spain and Ferdinand VII of Spain and the installation of Napoleon's brother as King Jos\u00e9 provoked civil wars and revolutions, leading to the independence of most of Spain's mainland American colonies. In Spanish America, many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII, whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the Spanish American wars of independence in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain, and led to the rise of strongmen in the wake of these wars. The defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815 caused an exodus of French soldiers into Latin America, where they joined ranks with the armies of the independence movements. While these officials had a role in various victories such as the Capture of Valdivia (1820), some are held responsible for significant defeats at the hands of the royalists, as was the case at the Second Battle of Cancha Rayada (1818).\nIn contrast, the Portuguese royal family escaped to Brazil and established the court there, resulting in political stability for Portuguese America. In 1816, Brazil was proclaimed an equal part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, paving the way to Brazilian independence six years later.\nThe Haitian Revolution began in 1791, just before the French Revolutionary Wars, and continued until 1804. France's defeat resulted in the independence of Saint-Domingue and led Napoleon to sell the territory making up the Louisiana Purchase to the United States.\nBarbary Wars.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the United States, Sweden, and Sicily fought against the Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean.\nInvasion of Russia, 1812.\nThe Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 resulted in the Anglo\u2013Russian War (1807\u20131812). Emperor Alexander I declared war on Britain after the British attack on Denmark in September 1807. British men-of-war supported the Swedish fleet during the Finnish War and won victories over the Russians in the Gulf of Finland in July 1808 and August 1809. The success of the Russian army on land, however, forced Sweden to sign peace treaties with Russia in 1809 and with France in 1810, and to join the blockade against Britain. But Franco\u2013Russian relations would become progressively worse after 1810, and the Russian war with Britain effectively ended. In April 1812, Britain, Russia, and Sweden signed secret agreements directed against Napoleon.\nThe central issue for both Emperor Napoleon I and Tsar Alexander I was control over Poland. Each wanted a semi-independent Poland he could control. As Esdaile notes, \"Implicit in the idea of a Russian Poland was, of course, a war against Napoleon.\" Schroeder says Poland was \"the root cause\" of Napoleon's war with Russia, but Russia's refusal to support the Continental System was also a factor.\nIn 1812, at the height of his power, Napoleon invaded Russia with a pan-European , consisting of 450,000 men (200,000 Frenchmen, and many soldiers of allies or subject areas). The French forces crossed the Niemen river on 24 June 1812. Russia proclaimed a Patriotic War, and Napoleon proclaimed a Second Polish war. The Poles supplied almost 100,000 men for the invasion force, but against their expectations, Napoleon avoided any concessions to Poland, having in mind further negotiations with Russia.\nThe marched through Russia, winning some relatively minor engagements and the major Battle of Smolensk on 16\u201318 August. In the same days, part of the French Army led by Marshal Nicolas Oudinot was stopped in the Battle of Polotsk by the right wing of the Russian Army, under command of General Peter Wittgenstein. This prevented the French march on the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg; the fate of the invasion was decided in Moscow, where Napoleon led his forces in person.\nThe main Imperial Russian Army was commanded by Field Marshal Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, who recognized that Napoleon's immediate goal was a decisive battle to crush the main Russian force in the west. In response, the Russian army used scorched-earth tactics as it withdrew east, and harried the with light Cossack cavalry. The did not adjust its operational methods in response. Provisioning such an enormous army with adequate food and fresh water had proven difficult since the very start of the campaign, exacerbated by the sparse terrain of western Russia; diseases such as typhus and dysentery rapidly became rampant among the rank and file. These factors led to most of the losses of the main column of the , which in one case amounted to 95,000 men, including deserters, in a week.\nThe main Russian army retreated for almost three months. This constant retreat led to the increasing unpopularity of Barclay de Tolly (who was a Baltic German and already mistrusted by the Russian elite) and a respected Russian veteran, Prince Mikhail Kutuzov, was made the new Commander-in-Chief by Tsar Alexander. Finally, the two armies engaged in the Battle of Borodino on 7 September, in the vicinity of Moscow. The battle was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than 250,000 men and resulting in at least 70,000 casualties. \nThe battle was indecisive; the French captured the main positions on the battlefield but failed to destroy the Russian army. While Kutuzov had recognized the political need to give battle, he also recognized that Barclay de Tolly's strategies had proven effective, and that the was bleeding personnel and supplies more and more severely with every step they took deeper into Russia. Napoleon's logistical difficulties meant that French casualties simply could not be replaced, whereas the Russian army could reinforce itself far more readily.\nNapoleon I entered Moscow on 14 September, after the Russian Army had retreated yet again. By then, the Russians had largely evacuated the city and released criminals from the prisons to inconvenience the French; the governor, Count Fyodor Rostopchin, ordered the city to be burnt. Alexander I refused to capitulate, and the peace talks attempted by Napoleon failed. Rather than withdraw further east, the Russian army withdrew south, rebuilding its strength and preparing to interfere with a French withdrawal. In October, with no sign of clear victory in sight, Napoleon began the disastrous Great Retreat from Moscow.\nThe French tried to reach Kaluga and swing through southern Russia, where they could find food and forage supplies. In the Battle of Maloyaroslavets, the replenished Russian army blocked the road to Kaluga. While an indecisive engagement, it nevertheless doomed the ; with the Russians refusing to be dislodged, Napoleon was forced to retreat back down the Smolensk road along which he had already advanced, and which had already been denuded of supplies \u2013 most crucially, food. \nThe French supply chain, already in tatters from the attrition of wagons and horses, began to collapse completely. The lack of horses also rendered Napoleon's cavalry ineffective, leaving the vulnerable to sustained guerrilla warfare by Russian peasants and irregular troops. The was dealt a further catastrophic blow by the onset of the Russian Winter, which the underfed and undersupplied was unprepared to cope with.\nWhen the remnants of Napoleon's army struggled across the Berezina River in November with the Russian army in pursuit, only 27,000 fit soldiers survived, with 380,000 men dead or missing and 100,000 captured. Napoleon then left his men and returned to Paris to prepare the defence against the advancing Russians. The campaign had effectively ended on 14 December 1812, when the last enemy troops left Russia. The Russians had lost around 210,000 men, but with their shorter supply lines, they soon replenished their armies. For every six soldiers of the that entered Russia, only one would make it out in fighting condition.\nWar of the Sixth Coalition, 1812\u20131814.\nSeeing an opportunity in Napoleon I's historic defeat, Prussia, Sweden and several other German states switched sides, joining Russia, the United Kingdom and others opposing Napoleon. Napoleon vowed that he would create a new army as large as the one he had sent into Russia, and quickly built up his forces in the east from 30,000 to 130,000 and eventually to 400,000. Napoleon inflicted 40,000 casualties on the Allies at L\u00fctzen (2 May 1813) and Bautzen (20\u201321 May 1813). Both battles involved forces of over 250,000, making them some of the largest conflicts of the wars so far. Klemens von Metternich in November 1813 offered Napoleon the Frankfurt proposals. They would allow Napoleon to remain Emperor but France would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers\" and lose control of most of Italy and Germany and the Netherlands. Napoleon still expected to win the wars, and rejected the terms. By 1814, as the Allies were closing in on Paris, Napoleon I did agree to the Frankfurt proposals, but it was too late and he rejected the new harsher terms proposed by the Allies.\nIn the Peninsular War, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, renewed the Anglo-Portuguese advance into Spain just after New Year in 1812, besieging and capturing the fortified towns of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, and crushing a French army at the Battle of Salamanca. As the French regrouped, the Anglo-Portuguese entered Madrid and advanced towards Burgos, before retreating all the way to Portugal when renewed French concentrations threatened to trap them. As a consequence of the Salamanca campaign, the French were forced to end their long siege of C\u00e1diz and to permanently evacuate the provinces of Andalusia and Asturias.\nIn a strategic move, Wellesley planned to move his supply base from Lisbon to Santander. The Anglo-Portuguese forces swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos. On 21 June, at Vitoria, the combined Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish armies won against Joseph Bonaparte, finally breaking French power in Spain. The French had to retreat from the Iberian peninsula, over the Pyrenees.\nThe belligerents declared an armistice from 4 June 1813 (continuing until 13 August) during which time both sides attempted to recover from the loss of approximately a quarter of a million men in the preceding two months. During this time coalition negotiations finally brought Austria out in open opposition to France. Two principal Austrian armies took the field, adding 300,000 men to the coalition armies in Germany. The Allies now had around 800,000 front-line soldiers in the German theatre, with a strategic reserve of 350,000 formed to support the front-line operations.\nNapoleon succeeded in bringing the imperial forces in the region to around 650,000\u2014although only 250,000 came under his direct command, with another 120,000 under Nicolas Charles Oudinot and 30,000 under Davout. The remaining imperial forces came mostly from the Confederation of the Rhine, especially Saxony and Bavaria. In addition, to the south, Murat's Kingdom of Naples and Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais's Kingdom of Italy had 100,000 armed men. In Spain, another 150,000 to 200,000 French troops steadily retreated before Anglo-Portuguese forces numbering around 100,000. Thus around 900,000 Frenchmen in all theatres faced around 1,800,000 coalition soldiers (including the strategic reserve under formation in Germany). The gross figures may mislead slightly, as most of the German troops fighting on the side of the French fought at best unreliably and stood on the verge of defecting to the Allies. One can reasonably say that Napoleon could count on no more than 450,000 men in Germany\u2014which left him outnumbered about four to one.\nFollowing the end of the armistice, Napoleon seemed to have regained the initiative at Dresden (August 1813), where he once again defeated a numerically superior coalition army and inflicted enormous casualties, while sustaining relatively few. The failures of his marshals and a slow resumption of the offensive on his part cost him any advantage that this victory might have secured. At the Battle of Leipzig in Saxony (16\u201319 October 1813), also called the \"Battle of the Nations\", 191,000 French fought more than 300,000 Allies, and the defeated French had to retreat into France. After the French withdrawal from Germany, Napoleon's remaining ally, Denmark\u2013Norway, became isolated and fell to the coalition.\nNapoleon then fought a series of battles in France, including the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube, but the overwhelming numbers of the Allies steadily forced him back. The Allies entered Paris on 30 March 1814. During this time Napoleon fought his Six Days' Campaign, in which he won many battles against the enemy forces advancing towards Paris. During this entire campaign, he never managed to field more than 70,000 men against more than half a million coalition soldiers. At the Treaty of Chaumont (9 March 1814), the Allies agreed to preserve the coalition until Napoleon's total defeat.\nNapoleon determined to fight on, even now, incapable of fathoming his fall from power. During the campaign, he had issued a decree for 900,000 fresh conscripts, but only a fraction of these materialised, and Napoleon's schemes for victory eventually gave way to the reality of his hopeless situation. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Occasional military actions continued in Italy, Spain, and Holland in early 1814. An armistice was signed with the Allied Powers on 23 April 1814. The First Treaty of Paris, signed on 30 May 1814, officially ended the War of the Sixth Coalition.\nThe victors exiled Napoleon to the island of Elba and restored the French Bourbon monarchy in the person of Louis XVIII. They signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau (11 April 1814) and initiated the Congress of Vienna to redraw the map of Europe.\nWar of the Seventh Coalition, 1815.\nThe Seventh Coalition (1815) pitted Britain, Russia, Prussia, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and several smaller German states against France. The period known as the Hundred Days began after Napoleon escaped from Elba and landed at Cannes (1 March 1815). Travelling to Paris, picking up support as he went, he eventually overthrew Louis XVIII. The Allies rapidly gathered their armies to meet him again. Napoleon raised 280,000 men, whom he distributed among several armies. To add to the 90,000-strong standing army, he recalled well over a quarter of a million veterans from past campaigns and issued a decree for the eventual draft of around 2.5\u00a0million new men into the French army, which was never achieved. This faced an initial coalition force of about 700,000\u2014although coalition campaign plans provided for one million front-line soldiers, supported by around 200,000 garrison, logistics and other auxiliary personnel.\nNapoleon took about 124,000 men of the Army of the North on a pre-emptive strike against the Allies in Belgium. He intended to attack the coalition armies before they combined, in hope of driving the British into the sea and the Prussians out of the war. His march to the frontier achieved the surprise he had planned, catching the Anglo-Dutch Army in a dispersed arrangement. The Prussians had been more wary, concentrating 75 per cent of their army in and around Ligny. The Prussians forced the to fight all the day of the 15th to reach Ligny in a delaying action by the Prussian 1st Corps. He forced Prussia to fight at Ligny on 16 June 1815, and the defeated Prussians retreated in disorder. On the same day, the left wing of the , under the command of Marshal Michel Ney, succeeded in stopping any of Wellington's forces going to aid Bl\u00fccher's Prussians by fighting a blocking action at Quatre Bras. Ney failed to clear the cross-roads and Wellington reinforced the position. But with the Prussian retreat, Wellington too had to retreat. He fell back to a previously reconnoitred position on an escarpment at Mont St Jean, a few miles south of the village of Waterloo.\nNapoleon took the reserve of the Army of the North, and reunited his forces with those of Ney to pursue Wellington's army, after he ordered Marshal Grouchy to take the right wing of the Army of the North and stop the Prussians regrouping. In the first of a series of miscalculations, both Grouchy and Napoleon failed to realise that the Prussian forces were already reorganised and were assembling at the city of Wavre. The French army did nothing to stop a rather leisurely retreat that took place throughout the night and into the early morning by the Prussians. As the 4th, 1st, and 2nd Prussian Corps marched through the town towards Waterloo, the 3rd Prussian Corps took up blocking positions across the river, and although Grouchy engaged and defeated the Prussian rearguard under the command of Lt-Gen von Thielmann in the Battle of Wavre (18\u201319 June) it was 12 hours too late. In the end, 17,000 Prussians had kept 33,000 badly needed French reinforcements off the field.\nNapoleon delayed the start of fighting at the Battle of Waterloo on the morning of 18 June for several hours while he waited for the ground to dry after the previous night's rain. By late afternoon, the French army had not succeeded in driving Wellington's forces from the escarpment on which they stood. When the Prussians arrived and attacked the French right flank in ever-increasing numbers, Napoleon's strategy of keeping the coalition armies divided had failed and a combined coalition general advance drove his army from the field in confusion.\nGrouchy organised a successful and well-ordered retreat towards Paris, where Marshal Davout had 117,000 men ready to turn back the 116,000 men of Bl\u00fccher and Wellington. General Vandamme was defeated at the Battle of Issy and negotiations for surrender had begun.\nOn arriving at Paris three days after Waterloo, Napoleon still clung to the hope of a concerted national resistance; but the temper of the legislative chambers, and of the public generally, did not favour his view. Lacking support Napoleon abdicated again on 22 June 1815, and on 15 July he surrendered to the British squadron at Rochefort. The Allies exiled him to the remote South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, where he died on 5 May 1821.\nIn Italy, Joachim Murat, whom the Allies had allowed to remain King of Naples after Napoleon's initial defeat, once again allied with his brother-in-law, triggering the Neapolitan War (March to May 1815). Hoping to find support among Italian nationalists fearing the increasing influence of the Habsburgs in Italy, Murat issued the Rimini Proclamation inciting them to war. The proclamation failed and the Austrians soon crushed Murat at the Battle of Tolentino (2\u20133 May 1815), forcing him to flee. The Bourbons returned to the throne of Naples on 20 May 1815. Murat tried to regain his throne, but after that failed, he was executed by firing squad on 13 October 1815.\nThe Second Treaty of Paris, signed on 20 November 1815, officially marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars.\nPolitical effects.\nThe Napoleonic Wars brought radical changes to Europe, but the reactionary forces returned and restored the Bourbon house to the French throne. Napoleon had succeeded in bringing most of Western Europe under one rule. In most European countries, subjugation in the French Empire brought with it many liberal features of the French Revolution including democracy, due process in courts, abolition of serfdom, reduction of the power of the Catholic Church, and demand for constitutional limits on monarchs. The increasing voice of the middle classes with rising commerce and industry meant that restored European monarchs found it difficult to restore pre-revolutionary absolutism and had to retain many of the reforms enacted during Napoleon's rule. Institutional legacies remain to this day in the form of civil law, with clearly defined codes of law\u2014an enduring legacy of the Napoleonic Code.\nFrance's constant warfare with the combined forces of different combinations of, and eventually all, of the other major powers of Europe for over two decades finally took its toll. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, France no longer held the role of the dominant power in Continental Europe, as it had since the times of Louis XIV, as the Congress of Vienna produced a \"balance of power\" by resizing the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace. In this regard, Prussia was restored in its former borders, and also received large chunks of Poland and Saxony. Greatly enlarged, Prussia became a permanent Great Power. In order to drag Prussia's attention towards the west and France, the Congress also gave the Rhineland and Westphalia to Prussia. These industrial regions transformed agrarian Prussia into an industrial leader in the nineteenth century. Britain emerged as the most important economic power, and its Royal Navy held unquestioned naval superiority across the globe well into the 20th century.\nAfter the Napoleonic period, nationalism, a relatively new movement, became increasingly significant. This shaped much of the course of future European history. Its growth spelled the beginning of some states and the end of others, as the map of Europe changed dramatically in the hundred years following the Napoleonic Era. Rule by fiefdoms and aristocracy was widely replaced by national ideologies based on shared origins and culture. Bonaparte's reign over Europe sowed the seeds for the founding of the nation-states of Germany and Italy by starting the process of consolidating city-states, kingdoms and principalities. At the end of the war, Denmark was forced to cede Norway to Sweden mainly as a compensation for the loss of Finland which the other coalition members agreed to, but because Norway had signed its own constitution on 17 May 1814 Sweden initiated the Swedish\u2013Norwegian War (1814). The war was a short one taking place between 26 July \u2013 14 August 1814 and was a Swedish victory that put Norway into a personal union with Sweden. The union was peacefully dissolved in 1905. The United Kingdom of the Netherlands created as a buffer state against France dissolved rapidly with the independence of Belgium in 1830.\nThe Napoleonic wars also played a key role in the independence of the Latin American colonies from Spain and Portugal. The conflict weakened the authority and military power of Spain, especially after the Battle of Trafalgar. There were many uprisings in Spanish America, leading to the wars of independence. In Portuguese America, Brazil experienced greater autonomy as it now served as seat of the Portuguese Empire and ascended politically to the status of Kingdom. These events also contributed to the Portuguese Liberal Revolution in 1820 and the Independence of Brazil in 1822.\nThe century of relative transatlantic peace, after the Congress of Vienna, enabled the \"greatest intercontinental migration in human history\" beginning with \"a big spurt of immigration after the release of the dam erected by the Napoleonic Wars.\" Immigration inflows relative to the US population rose to record levels (peaking at 1.6 per cent in 1850\u201351) as 30\u00a0million Europeans relocated to the United States between 1815 and 1914.\nAnother concept emerged from the Congress of Vienna\u2014that of a unified Europe. After his defeat, Napoleon deplored the fact that his dream of a free and peaceful \"European association\" remained unaccomplished. Such a European association would share the same principles of government, system of measurement, currency and Civil Code. One-and-a-half centuries later, and after two world wars several of these ideals re-emerged in the form of the European Union.\nMilitary legacy.\nEnlarged scope.\nUntil the time of Napoleon, European states employed relatively small armies, made up of both national soldiers and mercenaries. These regulars were highly drilled, professional soldiers. Ancien R\u00e9gime armies could only deploy small field armies due to rudimentary staffs and comprehensive yet cumbersome logistics. Both issues combined to limit field forces to approximately 30,000 men under a single commander.\nMilitary innovators in the mid-18th century began to recognise the potential of an entire nation at war: a \"nation in arms\".\nThe scale of warfare dramatically enlarged during the Revolutionary and subsequent Napoleonic Wars. During Europe's major pre-revolutionary war, the Seven Years' War of 1756\u20131763, few armies ever numbered more than 200,000 with field forces often numbering less than 30,000. The French innovations of separate corps (allowing a single commander to efficiently command more than the traditional command span of 30,000 men) and living off the land (which allowed field armies to deploy more men without requiring an equal increase in supply arrangements such as depots and supply trains) allowed the French republic to field much larger armies than their opponents. Napoleon ensured during the time of the French republic that separate French field armies operated as a single army under his control, often allowing him to substantially outnumber his opponents. This forced his continental opponents to also increase the size of their armies, moving away from the traditional small, well-drilled Ancien R\u00e9gime armies of the 18th century to mass conscript armies.\nThe Battle of Marengo, which largely ended the War of the Second Coalition, was fought with fewer than 60,000 men on both sides. The Battle of Austerlitz which ended the War of the Third Coalition involved fewer than 160,000 men. The Battle of Friedland which led to peace with Russia in 1807 involved about 150,000 men.\nAfter these defeats, the continental powers developed various forms of mass conscription to allow them to face France on even terms, and the size of field armies increased rapidly. The Battle of Wagram of 1809 involved 300,000 men, and 500,000 fought at Leipzig in 1813, of whom 150,000 were killed or wounded.\nAbout a million French soldiers became casualties (wounded, invalided or killed), a higher proportion than in the First World War. The European total may have reached 5,000,000 military deaths, including disease.\nFrance had the second-largest population in Europe by the end of the 18th century (28\u00a0million, as compared to Britain's 12\u00a0million and Russia's 35 to 40\u00a0million). It was well poised to take advantage of the \"lev\u00e9e en masse\". Before Napoleon's efforts, Lazare Carnot played a large part in the reorganisation of the French Revolutionary Army from 1793 to 1794\u2014a time which saw previous French misfortunes reversed, with Republican armies advancing on all fronts.\nThe French army peaked in size in the 1790s with 1.5\u00a0million Frenchmen enlisted although battlefield strength was much less. Haphazard bookkeeping, rudimentary medical support and lax recruitment standards ensured that many soldiers either never existed, fell ill or were unable to withstand the physical demands of soldiering.\nAbout 2.8\u00a0million Frenchmen fought on land and about 150,000 at sea, bringing the total for France to almost 3\u00a0million combatants during almost 25 years of warfare.\nBritain had 750,000 men under arms between 1792 and 1815 as its army expanded from 40,000 men in 1793 to a peak of 250,000 men in 1813. Over 250,000 sailors served in the Royal Navy. In September 1812, Russia had 900,000 enlisted men in its army, and between 1799 and 1815 2.1\u00a0million men served in its army. Another 200,000 served in the Imperial Russian Navy. Out of the 900,000 men, the field armies deployed against France numbered less than 250,000.\nThere are no consistent statistics for other major combatants. Austria's forces peaked at about 576,000 (during the War of the Sixth Coalition) and had little or no naval component yet never fielded more than 250,000 men in field armies. After Britain, Austria proved the most persistent enemy of France; more than a million Austrians served during the long wars. Its large army was overall quite homogeneous and solid and in 1813 operated in Germany (140,000 men), Italy and the Balkans (90,000 men at its peak, about 50,000 men during most of the campaigning on these fronts). Austria's manpower was becoming quite limited towards the end of the wars, leading its generals to favour cautious and conservative strategies, to limit their losses.\nPrussia never had more than 320,000 men under arms at any time. In 1813\u20131815, the core of its army (about 100,000 men) was characterised by competence and determination, but the bulk of its forces consisted of second- and third-line troops, as well as militiamen of variable strength. Many of these troops performed reasonably well and often displayed considerable bravery but lacked the professionalism of their regular counterparts and were not as well equipped. Others were largely unfit for operations, except sieges. During the 1813 campaign, 130,000 men were used in the military operations, with 100,000 effectively participating in the main German campaign, and about 30,000 being used to besiege isolated French garrisons.\nSpain's armies also peaked at around 200,000 men, not including more than 50,000 guerrillas scattered over Spain. In addition the Maratha Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Italy, Naples and the Duchy of Warsaw each had more than 100,000 men under arms. Even small nations now had armies rivalling the size of the Great Powers' forces of past wars but most of these were poor quality forces only suitable for garrison duties. The size of their combat forces remained modest yet they could still provide a welcome addition to the major powers. The percentage of French troops in the which Napoleon led into Russia was about 50 per cent while the French allies also provided a significant contribution to the French forces in Spain. As these small nations joined the coalition forces in 1813\u20131814, they provided a useful addition to the coalition while depriving Napoleon of much-needed manpower.\nInnovations.\nThe initial stages of the Industrial Revolution had much to do with larger military forces\u2014it became easy to mass-produce weapons and thus to equip larger forces. Britain was the largest single manufacturer of armaments in this period. It supplied most of the weapons used by the coalition powers throughout the conflicts. France produced the second-largest total of armaments, equipping its own huge forces as well as those of the Confederation of the Rhine and other allies.\nNapoleon showed innovative tendencies in his use of mobility to offset numerical disadvantages, as demonstrated in the rout of the Austro\u2013Russian forces in 1805 in the Battle of Austerlitz. The French Army redefined the role of artillery, forming independent, mobile units, as opposed to the previous tradition of attaching artillery pieces in support of troops.\nThe semaphore system had allowed the French War-Minister, Carnot, to communicate with French forces on the frontiers throughout the 1790s. The French continued to use this system throughout the Napoleonic wars. Aerial surveillance was used for the first time when the French used a hot-air balloon to survey coalition positions before the Battle of Fleurus, on 26 June 1794.\nTotal war.\nHistorians have explored how the Napoleonic wars became total wars. Most historians argue that the escalation in size and scope came from two sources. First was the ideological clash between revolutionary/egalitarian and conservative/hierarchical belief systems. Second was the emergence of nationalism in France, Germany, Spain, and elsewhere, that made these \"people's wars\" instead of contests between monarchs. Bell has argued that even more important than ideology and nationalism were the intellectual transformations in the culture of war that came about through the Age of Enlightenment. One factor, he says, is that war was no longer a routine event but a transforming experience for societies\u2014a total experience. Secondly, the military emerged in its own right as a separate sphere of society distinct from the ordinary civilian world. The French Revolution made every civilian a part of the war machine, either as a soldier through universal conscription, or as a vital cog in the home front machinery supporting and supplying the army. Out of that, says Bell, came \"militarism\", the belief that the military role was morally superior to the civilian role in times of great national crisis. The fighting army represented the essence of the nation's soul. As Napoleon proclaimed, \"It is the soldier who founds a Republic and it is the soldier who maintains it.\" Napoleon said on his career \"I closed the gulf of anarchy and brought order out of chaos. I rewarded merit regardless of birth or wealth, wherever I found it. I abolished feudalism and restored equality to all religion and before the law. I fought the decrepit monarchies of the Old Regime because the alternative was the destruction of all this. I purified the Revolution.\"\nUse of military intelligence.\nIntelligence played a pivotal factor throughout the Napoleonic Wars and could very well have changed the tide of war. The use and misuse of military intelligence dictated the course of many major battles during the Napoleonic Wars. Some of the major battles that were dictated by the use of intelligence include: The Battle of Waterloo, Battle of Leipzig, Battle of Salamanca, and the Battle of Vitoria. A major exception to the greater use of superior military intelligence to claim victory was the Battle of Jena in 1806. At the Battle of Jena even Prussian superior military intelligence was not enough to counter the sheer military force of Napoleons' armies.\nThe use of intelligence varied greatly across the major world powers of the war. Napoleon at this time had more supply of intelligence given to him than any French general before him. However, Napoleon was not an advocate of military intelligence at this time as he often found it unreliable and inaccurate when compared to his own preconceived notions of the enemy. Napoleon rather studied his enemy via domestic newspapers, diplomatic publications, maps, and prior documents of military engagements in the theaters of war in which he would operate. It was this stout and constant study of the enemy which made Napoleon the military mastermind of his time. Whereas, his opponents\u2014Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia\u2014were much more reliant on traditional intelligence-gathering methods and were much quicker and more willing to act on them.\nThe methods of Intelligence during these wars were to include the formation of vast and complex networks of corresponding agents, codebreaking, and cryptanalysis. The greatest cipher to be used to hide military operations during this time was known as the Great Paris Cipher used by the French. However, thanks to the hard work of British codebreakers like George Scovell, the British were able to crack French ciphers and gain vast amounts of military intelligence on Napoleon and his armies.\nDiplomatic espionage.\nFrench diplomat Talleyrand served as a source of intelligence for the Coalition powers against Napoleon. At the Congress of Erfurt in September\u2013October 1808, Talleyrand secretly counseled Tsar Alexander. Alexander's attitude towards Napoleon was one of apprehensive opposition. Talleyrand believed Napoleon would eventually destroy the empire he had worked to build across multiple rulers. After his resignation in 1807 from the ministry, Talleyrand began to accept bribes from hostile powers (mainly Austria, but also Russia), to betray Napoleon's secrets.\nVarious agents of Napoleon were known such as Madame d'Oettlinger.\nIn fiction.\nThe Napoleonic Wars were a defining event of the early 19th century, and inspired many works of fiction, from then until the present day.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The former province of Olbia-Tempio was formed by a 2001 regional law that became effective in 2005. It contained a section of historic Gallura and was bordered by the provinces of Nuoro and Sassari.\nOn 6 May 2012 the regional referendums of Sardinia took place regarding the abolition of certain provinces and a variety of other matters. The suggestion of reforming or abolishing certain provinces in Sardinia was approved by the Regional Council of Sardinia on 24 May 2012. Due to this, the former province of Olbia-Tempio was ordered to form a new administrative body or be abolished on 1 March 2013, but this expiry date for constitutional changes was extended to 1 July 2013. Olbia-Tempio was suppressed as a province by the 2016 Regional Decree.\nIn April 2021, under Sardinian Regional Council's Regional Law Nr. 7, the province was restored now under the name of Province of Gallura North-East Sardinia (Provincia della Gallura Nord-Est Sardegna). Whilst the Italian government challenged the law, thus stalling its implementation, on March 12, 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled in favor of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. On April 13, 2023, the regional council, at the proposal of the regional government, approved an amendment to the 2021 reform, defining the timeframe and manner of its implementation, which would see its full implementation in 2025.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It also advocates compact, transit-oriented, walkable, bicycle-friendly land use, including neighborhood schools, complete streets, and mixed-use development with a range of housing choices. The term \"smart growth\" is particularly used in North America. In Europe and particularly the UK, the terms \"compact city\", \"urban densification\" or \"urban intensification\" have often been used to describe similar concepts, which have influenced government planning policies in the UK, the Netherlands and several other European countries.\nSmart growth values long-range, regional considerations of sustainability over a short-term focus. Its sustainable development goals are to achieve a unique sense of community and place; expand the range of transportation, employment, and housing choices; equitably distribute the costs and benefits of development; preserve and enhance natural and cultural resources; and promote public health.\nBasic concept.\nSmart growth is a theory of land development that accepts that growth and development will continue to occur, and so seeks to direct that growth in an intentional, comprehensive way. Its proponents include urban planners, architects, developers, community activists, and historic preservationists. The term \"smart growth\" is an attempt to reframe the conversation from \"growth\" versus \"no growth\" (or NIMBY) to good/smart growth versus bad/dumb growth. Proponents seek to distinguish smart growth from urban sprawl, which they claim causes most of the problems that fuel opposition to urban growth, such as traffic congestion and environmental degradation. Smart growth principles are directed at developing sustainable communities that provide a greater range of transportation and housing choices and prioritize infill and redevelopment in existing communities rather than development of \"greenfield\" farmland or natural lands. Some of the fundamental aims for the benefits of residents and the communities are increasing family income and wealth, providing safe walking routes to schools, fostering livable, safe and healthy places, stimulating economic activity (both locally and regionally), and developing, preserving and investing in built and natural resources.\nSmart growth \"principles\" describe the elements of community that are envisioned and smart growth \"regulations\" describe the various approaches to implementation, that is, how federal, state, and municipal governments choose to fulfill smart growth principles. Some of these regulatory approaches such as urban growth boundaries predate the use of the term \"smart growth\". One of the earliest efforts to establish smart growth forward as an explicit regulatory framework were put forth by the American Planning Association (APA). In 1997, the APA introduced a project called Growing Smart and published the \"Growing Smart Legislative Guidebook: Model Statutes for Planning and the Management of Change.\" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines smart growth as \u201ca range of development and conservation strategies that help protect our health and natural environment and make our communities more attractive, economically stronger, and more socially diverse.\" Smart growth agenda is comprehensive and ambitious, however, its implementation is problematic as control of outward movement means limiting availability of single-family homes and reliance on the automobile, the mainstay of the traditional American lifestyle.\nSmart growth is related to, or may be used in combination with, the following concepts:\nThe smart growth approach to development is multifaceted and can encompass a variety of techniques. For example, in the state of Massachusetts smart growth is enacted by a combination of techniques including increasing housing density along transit nodes, conserving farm land, and mixing residential and commercial use areas. Perhaps the most descriptive term to characterize this concept is Traditional Neighborhood Development, which recognizes that smart growth and related concepts are not necessarily new, but are a response to car culture and sprawl. Many favor the term New Urbanism, which invokes a new, but traditional way of looking at urban planning.\nThere are a range of best practices associated with smart growth. These include supporting existing communities, redeveloping underutilized sites, enhancing economic competitiveness, providing more transportation choices, developing livability measures and tools, promoting equitable and affordable housing, providing a vision for sustainable growth, enhancing integrated planning and investment, aligning, coordinating, and leveraging government policies, redefining housing affordability and making the development process transparent.\nRelated, but somewhat different, are the overarching goals of smart growth, and they include: making the community more competitive for new businesses, providing alternative places to shop, work, and play, creating a better \"Sense of Place,\" providing jobs for residents, increasing property values, improving quality of life, expanding the tax base, preserving open space, controlling growth, and improving safety.\nBasic principles.\nThere are 10 accepted principles that define smart growth:\nHistory.\nTransportation and community planners began to promote the idea of compact cities and communities and adopt many of the regulatory approaches associated with smart growth in the early 1970s. The cost and difficulty of acquiring land (particularly in historic and/or areas designated as conservancies) to build and widen highways caused some politicians to reconsider basing transportation planning on motor vehicles.\nThe Congress for the New Urbanism, with architect Peter Calthorpe, promoted and popularized the idea of urban villages that relied on public transportation, bicycling, and walking instead of automobile use. Architect Andr\u00e9s Duany promoted changing design codes to promote a sense of community, and to discourage driving. Colin Buchanan and Stephen Plowden helped to lead the debate in the United Kingdom.\nThe Local Government Commission which presents the annual New Partners for Smart Growth conference adopted the original Ahwahnee Principles in 1991 which articulates many of the major principles now generally accepted as part of the smart growth movement such as transit oriented development, a focus on walking distance, greenbelts and wildlife corridors, and infill and redevelopment. The document was co-authored by several of the founders of the New Urbanist movement. The Local Government Commission has been co-sponsoring smart growth-related conferences since 1997. The New Partners for Smart Growth Conference started under that name circa 2002.\nSmart Growth America, an organization devoted to promoting smart growth in the United States, was founded in 2002. This organization leads an evolving coalition of national and regional organizations most of which predated its founding such as 1000 Friends of Oregon, founded in 1975, and the Congress for the New Urbanism, founded in 1993. The EPA launched its smart growth program in 1995.\nRationale for smart growth.\nSmart growth is an alternative to urban sprawl, traffic congestion, disconnected neighborhoods, and urban decay. Its principles challenge old assumptions in urban planning, such as the value of detached houses and automobile use.\nEnvironmental protection.\nEnvironmentalists promote smart growth by advocating urban-growth boundaries, or Green belts, as they have been termed in England since the 1930s.\nPublic health.\nTransit-oriented development can improve the quality of life and encourage a healthier, pedestrian-based lifestyle with less pollution. EPA suggests that smart growth can help reduce air pollution, improve water quality, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nReaction to existing subsidies.\nSmart growth advocates claim that much of the urban sprawl of the 20th century was due to government subsidies for infrastructure that redistribute the true costs of sprawl. Examples include subsidies for highway building, fossil fuels, and electricity.\nElectrical subsidies.\nWith electricity, there is a cost associated with extending and maintaining the service delivery system, as with water and sewage, but there also is a loss in the commodity being delivered. The farther from the generator, the more power is lost in distribution. According to the Department of Energy's (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA), 9 percent of energy is lost in transmission.\nCurrent average cost pricing, where customers pay the same price per unit of power regardless of the true cost of their service, subsidizes sprawl development. With electricity deregulation, some states now charge customers/developers fees for extending distribution to new locations rather than rolling such costs into utility rates.\nNew Jersey, for example, has implemented a plan that divides the state into five planning areas, some of which are designated for growth, while others are protected. The state is developing a series of incentives to coax local governments into changing zoning laws that will be compatible with the state plan. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities recently proposed a revised rule that presents a tiered approach to utility financing. In areas not designated for growth, utilities and their ratepayers are forbidden to cover the costs of extending utility lines to new developments\u2014and developers will be required to pay the full cost of public utility infrastructure. In designated growth areas that have local smart plans endorsed by the State Planning Commission, developers will be refunded the cost of extending utility lines to new developments at two times the rate of the revenue received by developers in smart growth areas that do not have approved plans.\nElements.\nGrowth is \"smart growth\", to the extent that it includes the elements listed below.\nCompact neighborhoods.\nCompact, livable urban neighborhoods attract more people and business. Creating such neighborhoods is a critical element of reducing urban sprawl and protecting the climate. Such a tactic includes adopting redevelopment strategies and zoning policies that channel housing and job growth into urban centers and neighborhood business districts, to create compact, walkable, and bike- and transit-friendly hubs. This sometimes requires local governmental bodies to implement code changes that allow increased height and density downtown and regulations that not only eliminate minimum parking requirements for new development but establish a maximum number of allowed spaces. Other topics fall under this concept:\nIn sustainable architecture the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s.\nTransit-oriented development.\nTransit-oriented development (TOD) is a residential or commercial area designed to maximize access to public transport, and mixed-use/compact neighborhoods tend to use transit at all times of the day.\nMany cities striving to implement better TOD strategies seek to secure funding to create new public transportation infrastructure and improve existing services. Other measures might include regional cooperation to increase efficiency and expand services, and moving buses and trains more frequently through high-use areas. Other topics fall under this concept:\nPedestrian- and bicycle-friendly design.\nBiking and walking instead of driving can reduce emissions, save money on fuel and maintenance, and foster a healthier population. Pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly improvements include bike lanes on main streets, an urban bike-trail system, bike parking, pedestrian crossings, and associated master plans. The most pedestrian- and bike-friendly variant of smart growth and New Urbanism is New Pedestrianism) because motor vehicles are on a separate grid.\nPolicy tools.\nZoning ordinances.\nThe most widely used tool for achieving smart growth is modification of local zoning laws. Zoning laws are applicable to most cities and counties in the United States. Smart growth advocates often seek to modify zoning ordinances to increase the density of development and redevelopment allowed in or near existing towns and neighborhoods and/or restrict new development in outlying or environmentally sensitive areas. Additional density incentives can be offered for development of brownfield and greyfield land or for providing amenities such as parks and open space. Zoning ordinances typically include minimum parking requirements. Reductions in or elimination of parking minimums or imposition of parking maximums can also reduce the amount of parking built with new development increasing land available for parks and other community amenities.\nUrban growth boundaries.\nRelated to zoning ordinances, an urban growth boundary (UGB) is a tool used in some U.S. cities to contain high density development to certain areas. The first urban growth boundary in the United States was established in 1958 in Kentucky. Subsequently, urban growth boundaries were established in Oregon in the 1970s and Florida in the 1980s. Some believe that UGBs contributed to the escalation of housing prices from 2000 to 2006, as they limited the supply of developable land. However, this is not completely substantiated because prices continued to rise even after municipalities expanded their growth boundaries.\nTransfer of development rights.\nTransfer of development rights (TDR) systems are intended to allow property owners in areas deemed desirable for growth (such as infill and brownfield sites) to purchase the right to build at higher densities from owners of properties in areas deemed undesirable for growth such as environmental lands, farmlands or lands outside of an urban growth boundary. TDR programs have been implemented in over 200 U.S. communities.\nProvision of social infrastructure.\nSystematic provision of infrastructure such as schools, libraries, sporting facilities and community facilities is an integral component of smart growth communities. This is commonly known as 'social infrastructure' or 'community infrastructure'. In Australia, for example, most new suburban developments are master planned, and key social infrastructure is planned at the outset.\nEnvironmental impact assessments.\nOne popular approach to assist in smart growth in democratic countries is for lawmakers to require prospective developers to prepare environmental impact assessments of their plans as a condition for state and/or local governments to give them permission to build their buildings. These reports often indicate how significant impacts generated by the development will be mitigated, the cost of which is usually paid by the developer. These assessments are frequently controversial. Conservationists, neighborhood advocacy groups and NIMBYs are often skeptical about such impact reports, even when they are prepared by independent agencies and subsequently approved by the decision makers rather than the promoters. Conversely, developers will sometimes strongly resist being required to implement the mitigation measures required by the local government as they may be quite costly.\nIn communities practicing these smart growth policies, developers comply with local codes and requirements. Consequently, developer compliance builds communal trust because it demonstrates a genuine interest in the environmental quality of the community.\nCommunities implementing smart growth.\nEPA presented awards for smart growth achievement between 2002 and 2015. The awardees comprised 64 projects in 28 states. Among the localities receiving awards were:\nThe smart growth network has recognized these U.S. communities for implementing smart growth principles:\nThe European Union has recognized these cities and regions for implementing \"smart specialization\" which originated from smart growth principles:\nIn May 2011, The European Union released a Regional Policy report for smart growth policy for 2020. The Regional Policy report stated smart specialization was the strategy to focus Europe's resources and administer smart growth principles.\nIn July 2011, \"The Atlantic\" magazine called the BeltLine, a series of housing, trail, and transit projects along a 22-mile (35-km) long disused rail corridor surrounding the core of Atlanta, the United States' \"most ambitious smart growth project\".\nIn Savannah, Georgia (US) the historic Oglethorpe Plan has been shown to contain most of the elements of smart growth in its network of wards, each of which has a central civic square. The plan has demonstrated its resilience to changing conditions, and the city is using the plan as a model for growth in newer areas.\nIn Melbourne, Australia, almost all new outer-suburban developments are master planned, guided by the principles of smart growth.\nSmart growth, urban sprawl and automobile dependency.\nWhether smart growth (or the \"compact City\") does or can reduce problems of automobile dependency associated with urban sprawl have been fiercely contested issues over several decades. A 2007 meta-study by Keith Barthomomew of the University of Utah found that reductions in driving associated with compact development scenarios averaged 8 percent ranging up to 31.7 percent with the variation being explained by degree of land use mixing and density. An influential study in 1989 by Peter Newman and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia. The study has been criticised for its methodology but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted \u2014 although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.\nWithin cities studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and ex-urban residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income. This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection: people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour. More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.\nParadox of intensification.\nReviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour Melia \"et al.\" (2011) found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of smart growth. Planning policies which increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.\nFor example, Portland, Oregon a U.S. city which has pursued smart growth policies, substantially increased its population density between 1990 and 2000 when other US cities of a similar size were reducing in density. As predicted by the paradox, traffic volumes and congestion both increased more rapidly than in the other cities, despite a substantial increase in transit use.\nThese findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states \"Ceteris paribus, urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs\".\nAt the citywide level it may be possible, through a range of positive measures to counteract the increases in traffic and congestion which would otherwise result from increasing population densities: Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany is one example of a city which has been more successful in this respect.\nThis study also reviewed evidence on the local effects of building at higher densities. At the level of the neighbourhood or individual development positive measures (e.g. improvements to public transport) will usually be insufficient to counteract the traffic effect of increasing population density. This leaves policy-makers with four choices: intensify and accept the local consequences, sprawl and accept the wider consequences, a compromise with some element of both, or intensify accompanied by more radical measures such as parking restrictions, closing roads to traffic and carfree zones.\nIn contrast, the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts reported that its Kendall Square neighborhood saw a 40% increase in commercial space attended by a traffic decrease of 14%.\nA report by CEOs for Cities, \"Driven Apart,\" showed that while denser cities in the United States may have more congested commutes they are also shorter on average in both time and distance. This is in contrast to cities where commuters face less congestion but drive longer distances resulting in commutes that take as long or longer.\nCriticism.\nRobert Bruegmann, professor of art history, architecture, and urban planning at the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of \"Sprawl: A Compact History\", stated that historical attempts to combat urban sprawl have failed, and that the high population density of Los Angeles, currently the most dense urban area in the United States, \"lies at the root of many of the woes experienced by L.A. today.\"\nWendell Cox is a vocal opponent of smart growth policies. He argued before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that, \"smart growth strategies tend to intensify the very problems they are purported to solve.\" Cox and Joshua Utt analyzed smart growth and sprawl, and argued that:\nOur analysis indicates that the Current Urban Planning Assumptions are of virtually no value in predicting local government expenditures per capita. The lowest local government expenditures per capita are not in the higher density, slower growing, and older municipalities.\nOn the contrary, the actual data indicate that the lowest expenditures per capita tend to be in medium- and lower-density municipalities (though not the lowest density); medium- and faster-growing municipalities; and newer municipalities. This is after 50 years of unprecedented urban decentralization, which seems to be more than enough time to have developed the purported urban sprawl-related higher local government expenditures. It seems unlikely that the higher expenditures that did not develop due to sprawl in the last 50 years will evolve in the next 20 - despite predictions to the contrary in The Costs of Sprawl 2000 research.\nIt seems much more likely that the differences in municipal expenditures per capita are the result of political, rather than economic factors, especially the influence of special interests.\nThe phrase \"smart growth\" implies that other growth and development theories are not \"smart\". There is debate about whether transit-proximate development constitutes smart growth when it is not transit-oriented. The National Motorists Association does not object to smart growth as a whole, but strongly objects to traffic calming, which is intended to reduce automobile accidents and fatalities, but may also reduce automobile usage and increase alternate forms of public transportation.\nIn 2002 the National Center for Public Policy Research, a self-described conservative think tank, published an economic study entitled \"Smart Growth and Its Effects on Housing Markets: The New Segregation\" which termed smart growth \"restricted growth\" and suggested that smart growth policies disfavor minorities and the poor by driving up housing prices.\nSome libertarian groups, such as the Cato Institute, criticize smart growth on the grounds that it leads to greatly increased land values, and people with average incomes can no longer afford to buy detached houses.\nA number of ecological economists claim that industrial civilization has already \"overshot\" the carrying capacity of the Earth, and \"smart growth\" is mostly an illusion. Instead, a steady state economy would be needed to bring human societies back into a necessary balance with the ability of the ecosystem to sustain humans (and other species).\nA study released in November 2009 characterized the smart-growth policies in the U.S. state of Maryland as a failure, concluding that \"[t]here is no evidence after ten years that [smart-growth laws] have had any effect on development patterns.\" Factors include a lack of incentives for builders to redevelop older neighborhoods and limits on the ability of state planners to force local jurisdictions to approve high-density developments in \"smart-growth\" areas. Buyers demand low-density development and voters tend to oppose high density developments near them.\nBeginning in 2010, groups generally associated with the Tea Party movement began to identify Smart Growth as an outgrowth of the United Nations Agenda 21 which they viewed as an attempt by international interests to force a \"sustainable\" lifestyle on the United States. However planning groups and even some smart growth opponents counter that Smart Growth concepts and groups predate the 1992 Agenda 21 conference. In addition the word \"sustainable development\" as used in the Agenda 21 report is often misread to mean real estate development when it typically refers to the much broader concept of human development in the United Nations and foreign aid context which addresses a broader slate of economic, health, poverty, and education issues.\nSee also.\nRelated topics\nOrganizations\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the oldest cities on the island, it contains a considerable collection of art.\nSince its origins at the turn of the 12th century, Sassari has been ruled by the Giudicato of Torres, the Pisans, as an independent republic in alliance with Genoa, by the Aragonese and the Spanish, all of whom have contributed to Sassari's historical and artistic heritage. Sassari is a city rich in art, culture and history, and is well known for its palazzi, the Fountain of the Rosello, and its elegant neoclassical architecture, such as Piazza d'Italia (Italy Square) and the Teatro Civico (Civic Theatre).\nAs Sardinia's second most populated city, it has a considerable amount of cultural, touristic, commercial and political importance in the island. The city's economy mainly relies on tourism and services, however also partially on research, construction, pharmaceuticals and the petroleum industry.\nHistory.\nPrehistory and ancient history.\nAlthough Sassari was founded in the early Middle Ages, the surrounding area has been inhabited since the Neolithic age, and throughout ancient history, by the Nuragics and the Romans. Many archaeological sites and ancient ruins are located inside or around the town: the prehistoric step pyramid of Monte d'Accoddi, a large number of Nuraghes and Domus de Janas (Fairy Houses), the ruins of a Roman aqueduct, the ruins of a Roman villa discovered under San Nicholas Cathedral, and a portion of the ancient road that connected the Latin city of Turris Libisonis with Caralis. In the locality of \"Fiume Santo\" is also found a fossil site where an \"Oreopithecus bambolii\", a prehistoric anthropomorphic primate, was discovered, dated at 8.5 million years.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe origin of the city remains uncertain. Among the theses, according to folk tradition the first village was founded around the 9th\u201310th century AD by the inhabitants of the ancient Roman port of \"Turris Libisonis\" (current Porto Torres), who sought refuge in the mainland to escape the Saracen attacks from the sea.\nIt developed from the merger of a number of separate villages, such as San Pietro di Silki, San Giacomo di Taniga, and San Giovanni di Bosove. The oldest mention of the village is in an 1131 document in the archive of the Monastery of St. Peter in Silki where is cited a man named \"Jordi de Sassaro\" (George of Sassari), a serf from the nearby village of Bosove. Sassari was sacked by the Genoese in 1166. Immigration continued until, in the early 13th century, it was the most populous city in the Giudicato of Torres, and its last capital. After the assassination of Michele Zanche, the latter's last ruler in 1275, Sassari became subject to the Republic of Pisa with a semi-independent status.\nIn 1284, the Pisans were defeated by the Genoese fleet at the Battle of Meloria, and the city was able to free itself: it became the Republic of Sassari, the first and only early independent renaissance city-state of Sardinia, with statutes of its own, allied to Genoa; the Genoese were pleased to see it thus withdrawn from Pisan control. Its statutes of 1316 are remarkable for the leniency of the penalties imposed when compared with the penal laws of the Middle Ages.\nFrom 1323, the Republic of Sassari decided to side with the King of Aragon, in whose hands it remained for much of the following centuries, though the population revolted at least three times. The revolts ceased when King Alfonso V of Aragon nominated the town as a Royal Burg, directly ruled by the King and free from feudal taxation, during a period in which it may have been the most populous city in Sardinia. Further attempts made by Genoa to conquer the city failed. In 1391 it was conquered by Brancaleone Doria and Marianus V of Arborea, of the independent Sardinian Giudicato of Arborea, of which it became the last capital.\nHowever, in 1420, the city was sold along with the remaining territory for 100,000 florins to the Crown of Aragon, replaced by Spain after 1479 on the joining of the Aragonese and Castilian thrones.\nRenaissance.\nThe city alternated years of crisis, featuring economic exploitation, the decrease of the maritime trade, made unsafe by the daily raids of Saracen pirates, political corruption of its rulers, the sacking of Sassari in 1527 by the French, and two plagues in 1528 and 1652, with periods of cultural and economic prosperity. The Jesuits founded the first Sardinian university in Sassari in 1562. In the same year, the first printing press was introduced and the ideals of Renaissance humanism became more widely known. Several artists of the Mannerist and Flemish schools practiced their art in the city.\nModern history.\nAfter the end of the Spanish period following the European wars of the early 18th century, the brief period of Austrian rule (1708\u20131717) was succeeded by domination by the Piedmontese, who then took over the title of Kingdom of Sardinia (1720\u20131861). In 1795 an anti-feudal uprising broke out in the town, led by the Emissary of the Viceroy Giovanni Maria Angioy, a Sardinian civil servant, who later fought unsuccessfully against the house of Savoy. The city was occupied by troops at the time. The dynasty of the Piedmontese King of Sardinia went on to the monarchs of Italy. Sassari, along with the rest of Italy, became part of the newly created Kingdom of Italy.\nAt the end of the 18th century, the university was restored. In 1836, after six hundred years, the medieval walls were partially demolished, allowing the town to expand. New urban plans were developed, on the model of the capital of the new regime (Turin), with geometric streets and squares.\nSassari became an important industrial center. In the 19th century, it was the second most important town in what was to become the future Italy for the production of leather, and in 1848 the Sassarese entrepreneur Giovanni Antonio Sanna gained control of the mine at Montevecchio, becoming the third richest man in the new Kingdom of Italy. The first railway was opened in 1872.\nIn 1877, the old Aragonese castle was demolished, and on the site the \"Caserma La Marmora\" was built, where the headquarters of \"Brigata Sassari\" is still located. Founded in 1915, it still consists mainly of Sardinian soldiers.\nAt the end of the 19th century, new urban developments grew on Cappuccini Hill and to the south of the city, architecturally dominated by Eclecticism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles, which created a movement towards the hybrid experimentation of new local architectural styles, known as the \"Sassarese Liberty\".\nDuring the Fascist dictatorship, the town had over fifty thousand inhabitants and new neighbourhoods were built, the most important of these being Monte Rosello and Porcellana, typical examples of Rationalist Architecture. On the other hand, the newspaper \"La Nuova Sardegna\", considered subversive, was closed down. During the Second World War three Allied attempts to bomb the town failed: only the railway station was damaged, and there was only one casualty.\nThe 8th Stage of the 2023 Giro Donne finished at Salassa on 8 July.\nGeography.\nSassari is located in north-western Sardinia, at above sea level. The area rises up on a wide karstic plateau that slopes gently down towards the Gulf of Asinara and the Nurra plain. The city is surrounded by a green belt of thousands of hectares of olive plantations, which from the 19th century have partly replaced the mixed woodlands of oak and other Mediterranean trees as well as the maquis shrubland. The thinly populated Nurra Plain, located to the west, occupies the main part of the region of Sassari, while the urban agglomeration, with a population of about 275,000 inhabitants, is located to the south east. The abundance of water, with about 400 springs and artesian wells, has made for much development of horticulture over the centuries.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2025, there are 120,497 people residing in Sassari, of whom 48.4% are male and 51.6% are female. Minors make up 12.4% of the population, and pensioners make up 26.6%. This compares with the Italian average of 14.9% minors and 24.7% pensioners.\nCulture.\nLanguage.\nSassarese (\"Sassaresu\" or \"Turritanu\") is much closer to Corsican and Tuscan language than it is to Sardinian, although this fact has caused some political controversy. It originated as a lingua franca between the first Sardinians, Corsicans, Tuscans and Ligurian people, during the period of the maritime republics. The original Tuscan structure was influenced by the Sardinian Logudorese spoken in the area, with a strong influence that can be felt in its phonetics and vocabulary, and by Catalan and Spanish in vocabulary.\nSassarese is spoken in Sassari and its immediate area by approximately 120,000 people out a total population of 175,000 inhabitants; it is also the language of the north-west of Sardinia, including Stintino, Sorso and Porto Torres; in the mid-northern areas of Sardinia, its \"Castellanesi\" dialects of Castelsardo, Tergu and Sedini are more similar to the Gallurese.\nSport.\nFootball.\nThe city of Sassari has U.S.D. Latte Dolce, the Torres Calcio Femminile that won seven Serie A titles, eight Coppa Italia, seven Supercoppa Italiana and two Italy Women's Cup. The main football team is S.E.F. Torres 1903 who won the two Serie C2 in 1986\u201387 and 1999\u201300. The club is also famous for lanching players like Gianfranco Zola, Pietro Paolo Virdis, Antonello Cuccureddu, Comunardo Niccolai, Theofilos Karasavvidis, Walter Mazzarri.\nBasketball.\nSassari has the main basketball team that Dinamo Sassari in the 2014\u201315 won Italian League, the club won also the Italian Cup in 2014 and 2015 and the Italian Supercup in 2014 and 2019. in 2018\u201319 the club won the FIBA Europe Cup.\nInfrastructure.\nThe city has the main Stadio Vanni Sanna where it is held some concerts and where plays the Torres Calcio Femminile, S.E.F. Torres 1903 and U.S.D. Latte Dolce. The Palasport Roberta Serradimigni is the indoor basketball arena where the basketball team of Dinamo Sassari plays and where it is held some concerts.\nGovernment.\nAdministrative subdivision.\nThe Municipality of Sassari was subdivided into ten \"circoscrizioni\" (administrative districts), reduced to six since the elections of May 3, 2000, and four since the elections of May 31, 2010.\nEducation.\nThe University of Sassari is the oldest in Sardinia (founded by the Jesuits in 1562), and has a high reputation, especially in Jurisprudence, Veterinary Medicine, Medicine, and Agriculture. Its libraries contain a number of ancient documents, among them the condaghes, Sardinia's first legal codes and the first documents written in the Sardinian language (11th century) and the famous Carta de Logu (the constitution issued by Marianus IV of Arborea and updated later by his daughter the \"Giudichessa\" Eleanor of Arborea) in the 14th century.\nTransportation.\nThe nearest airport, Fertilia International Airport, is from the city center, and the closest seaport is located at Porto Torres, away.\nUrban and suburban public transport is operated by about 25 bus lines of \"Azienda Trasporti Pubblici\" (ATP) and by a light rail transit of \"Azienda Regionale Sarda Trasporti\" (ARST). Two different railway companies connect the town to the rest of the island: Trenitalia links Sassari to Porto Torres, Oristano, Cagliari, Olbia, Golfo Aranci, and the ARST reaches Alghero, Sorso, Nulvi and Palau.\nDual carriage motorways link Sassari to Porto Torres, Platamona, Cagliari (\"SS131\"), Olbia (\"SS199\") and to Alghero (\"SS291\"). High-capacity traffic roads connect Sassari to Tempio Pausania (\"SS672\") and Ittiri.\nNotable people.\nNotable people born here include the former presidents of the Italian Republic, Antonio Segni and Francesco Cossiga, and Enrico Berlinguer, secretary of the Italian Communist Party.\nSassari is also the birthplace of Domenico Alberto Azuni, a jurist expert in commercial law.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nSassari is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is called in Italian, meaning 'sheet music', in reference to its large and paper-thin shape, which is said to be so thin before cooking that a sheet of music can be read through it. It is typically paired with pecorino cheese and wine.\nThe bread is thin and crisp, usually in the form of a dish half a meter wide. It is made by taking baked flat bread (made of durum wheat flour, salt, yeast, and water), then separating it into two sheets which are baked again. The recipe is very ancient and was conceived for shepherds, who used to stay far from home for months at a time: \"pane carasau\" can last up to one year if it is kept dry. The bread can be eaten either dry or wet (with water, wine, or sauces). A similar, yeast-free bread, with added seasoning, is known as ('dripped bread').\nRemains of the bread were found in archeological excavations of nuraghes (traditional Sardinian stone buildings) and it was therefore already eaten on the island prior to 1000\u00a0BCE.\n\"Pane carasau\" is the main ingredient of \"pane frattau\", a traditional dish from the central part of Sardinia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45433", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45433", "title": "Bastia", "text": "Bastia ( , ; , ; ) is a commune in the department of Haute-Corse, Corsica, France. It is located in the northeast of the island of Corsica at the base of Cap Corse. It also has the second-highest population of any commune on the island after Ajaccio and is the capital of the Bagnaja region and of the department.\nBastia is the principal port of the island and its principal commercial town and is known for its wines. The inhabitants of the commune are known as \"Bastiais\" or \"Bastiaises\". The commune has been awarded three flowers by the \"National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom\" in the \"Competition of cities and villages in Bloom\".\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nDuring the Roman Empire, the site of Cardo with the north-eastern district of the current commune of Bastia and Pietrabugno formed a Pieve: the oldest known administrative division. This territory was occupied by the Vanacimi people. Bastia did not exist. Neither Ptolemy, Strabo, or Pliny in the descriptions they made of the island mentioned Bastia.\nMiddle Ages.\nAt the end of the 9th century, the territory or \"pieve\" of Mantino depended on the lords \"Loretesi\". They were driven out in 1072 by the Da Furiani, \"Aschesi\" or \"Laschesi\", aided by the Marquis of Massa.\nIn 1370, the Republic of Genoa sent two governors to Corsica: Leonello Lomellino and Aluigi Toriorino. Shortly afterwards, considering the great expense and little profit in Corsica, the Republic decided to withdraw and no longer intervene in the affairs of the island. Nevertheless some Genoese gentlemen formed a partnership known as the Maona to try and manage the economy on the island on behalf of the Republic of Genoa. The five partners were: Leonello Lomellino, Giovanni da Balagnera, Aluigi Tortorino, Andreolo Ficone, and Cristoforo Maruffo. They all came with the title of Governor and brought with them a thousand soldiers.\nAfter an expedition to Cinarca followed by a short period of peace, Leonello Lomellino returned as governor and to gain an advantage over the Count Arrigo della Rocca with whom he would have to fight, he began by fortifying Al\u00e9ria. \" Then Count Arrigo and his allies once again crossed the mountains and made incursions against Cap Corse: having met no resistance, they went to besiege Al\u00e9ria which capitulated after four months. Leonello, deprived of all support, returned to Biguglia and from there he went to build the castle of Bastia to maintain his sea communications\".\n\"Between the second half of the 12th century and the middle of the 13th century the feudal system was in place at all levels of society and new links were created between the elite of the aristocracy and the Maritime republics, between representatives of the island's nobility, and between them and the poor. At the same time castles multiplied. They were then owned by fifteen noble families of local or peninsular origin, sometimes fragmented into independent lordships or even [sic] rivals: Bagnaia, Amondaschi, Cortinchi, Pinaschi de Coasini, Lotreto de Nebbio, Loreto de Casinca, Orezza, Avogari, Camilla, Turca, Pevere, de Mari (from the mid-13th century only), and the \"Marquis de Massa and Corsica\"\".\n\u2013 Daniel Istria \u2013 \"Powers and fortifications in northern Corsica 11th \u2013 14th Century\", p.\u00a0145\nAccording to Giovanni della Grossa, the \"seigneurialisation\" of Loreto would have been, as with Genoese families of the Cape, usurping the County title acquired during the \"people's government\". Small lordships that emerged from the courts of the Bishop of Nebbio, probably sometime in the second half of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century, were partly absorbed by the lords of Bagnaia before 1247. Then, before 1289, they were recovered and absorbed, like many others in the new lordship of Giovanninello de Loreto. Taking advantage of the Genoese-pisano rivalries, he extended his possessions to the east and west.\nWritten documentation illustrates the business of territorial conquest conducted by Giovanninello during the years 1260\u20131280. After raiding the castles of Nebbio and Pureto in the Ostriconi, he went on to the conquest of the pieve of Orto, which was then under the control of Bagnaia, and he built two new fortifications: Montebello and Petra di Bugno. These were intended not only to dominate and control the northern part of Bagnaia, whose Cerlino Lake had a certain economic interest, but probably also to neutralise Porto Cardo, which occupied a strategic military position as well as having businesses. It was here that the fortress of Bastia was erected, the residence of the Genoese governors from the 15th century. The agreements between Giovanninello and the commune of Genoa in 1289 demonstrated the importance of this baronial control of land routes and anchorages, a major source of revenue and a guarantee of the security of the territory.\nOriginally Cardo.\nBefore the occupation of Corsica by the Genoese there were several communities of the pieve of Orto: Soverta, La Vetrice, Belgodere, Astima, and Le Corbaia. All these villages have today almost disappeared. On the coast there was a small hamlet inhabited by fishermen called Porto Cardo which means \"Cardo Port\".\nModern times.\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the Franciscans settled in the Pieve of Orto.\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, Monseigneur Agostino Giustiniani, Bishop of Nebbio, described in his \"Dialogo nominato Corsica\":\n\"[...] The pieve of Orto is almost ruined; it contains 340 fires. In this pi\u00e8ve is Biguglia with a convent of Friars Minor [...]. With Biguglia there are still these pi\u00e8ves: Furiani, Belgodere, Soverta, La Vetrice, and Corbaia; nowadays, all these villages have almost disappeared.\"\n\u2013 Agostino Giustiniani in \"Description of Corsica\", translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in \"History of Corsica\", Bulletin of the Society for Historical and Natural Sciences of Corsica \u2013 Volume I \u2013 1888, p.\u00a050. \nContinuing, he writes:\n\"It is in this pi\u00e8ve Bastia lies, home to the Bishop and Governor of Corsica. Before the last war this city had 700 houses divided into two districts: Terranova and Terravecchia. There was formerly in this place a castle or tower, or rather a fortress of the kind called on the continent \"Bastie\" [...]. Terravecchia was an open area which is now burned and ruined largely as a result of the war. The land is very steep on the lower slopes and walking is very painful; on the other hand the Terranova area is generally flat, with fairly wide streets and many modern houses. It is surrounded not only by a solid wall, which forms a continuous enclosure, but a wide and deep moat and magnificent bastions. The wall was begun in the time of Tomasino de Campofregoso, then lord of the island, and completed later through the efforts of the Bank of Saint George. The bastions and the moat were made by that same bank and by the Genoese government during the last war. The bank has added a very beautiful citadel but the benefits do not match the expense it required during its construction; it cost, in fact, 25,000 ducats. Bastia has two convents of Friars Minor, one of Recollects, and the other Capuchin. This city, being the governor's residence, prospered greatly but it also had much to suffer in recent wars. Although the main centre on the island many people were of the opinion that its importance will hardly increase. The first reason they give is that the population of the city is composed of Genoese and Corsicans: the Genoese, from Rivi\u00e8res, belong to the lower class. Most Corsicans also belonged in this class. There is a jealousy and rivalry between the inhabitants of Bastia so great that few mind the interests of the city: they apply themselves only to deceit and to oust each other and that is where we get all the evil. The second reason is that the city has no port. It has in fact a small bay where it is possible to relax on small boats. On the other hand, houses, until now, have been very poorly distributed. There is not one that has a stable nor even a well or a cistern, so that it is necessary to fetch water from the fountain outside. Also in summer the water is very hot because it comes from far away via an aqueduct.\nThe cellars are far from being good. Bastia is built on a rocky ground, where ducts and sewers can be dug only with great difficulty. The city has no pleasant walks and is also very exposed to the West Wind which sometimes lasts for eight or ten days, so we can not leave home because the wind is so strong that it shakes the houses. What is more advantageous for Bastia is to be near fertile country that produces some wine, such as at Cap Corse, and elsewhere wheat, as on the higher pi\u00e8ves. There is a at the doorstep and only a short distance from Piombino and other mainland locations. It is for these reasons, and not for others, that the Board has chosen Bastia to make the residence of its governors: because there is nowhere on the island where the governor would be better off than at Bastia\".\n\u2013 Agostino Giustiniani in \"Description of Corsica\", translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in \"History of Corsica\". \nHe ends his description as follows:\n\"There were still in the pi\u00e8ve of Orto two small villages with the main pieve church dedicated to Saint Mary. These two villages and the church were ruined after the last plague and also because of the negligence of the pi\u00e9vans. After Porraggia comes Punta d'Arco and the Chiurlino Lake, about ten miles long, which can be entered only by very small boats. In this lake is an island, where there is good hunting for wild boar. This place is called the island. There are also two other small islands where fishermen stay: one is called \"Ischia nova\" which became famous in the recent wars and the other is called \"Ischia Vacchia\". There is fishing in this lake for \"cephalic\" (cefalu or mazzardi), mullet (muggini), and other fish that make excellent Botargo. These fish and eels are taken in large quantities and serve as ordinary food for the inhabitants of Bastia, not to mention the fish that comes from the pi\u00e8ves of Orto, Mariana and Mercurio. Then comes the Port of Lo Pino then the Gulf of Bastia, which is called \"Portocardo\" by the sailors. There is then the Ruisseau de S. Nicolas, then successively the Port of Toga, Grigione, the port and Ruisseau di Pietranera where there is a tower.\"\n\u2013 Agostino Giustiniani in \"Description of Corsica\", translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in \"History of Corsica\". \nThe Genoese era.\nThe Genoese soon felt the need to protect Bastia from invasions coming from the sea and began to build a bastiglia (moat) and a citadel in the time of governor Leonello Lomellini.\nOver time, the \"Bastiglia\" (Bastia) has grown, become prosperous, and become more important than Cardo.\nIts history is in its \"bastiglia\" or citadel which was originally a walled city. Here it was the sea and the mountains that determined the location of habitations as well as the relief of the island. Bastia was the capital at the time of the Genoese domination. It spread to the slopes later, drawn toward the water in the \"Place Saint-Nicolas\".\nCreated by the Genoese patrician Leonello Lomellini in 1353 to liaise with Genoa, the city originated on the roack where a tower was built (a \"bastiglia\", hence its name) and, a hundred years later, was surrounded by walls.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, many improvements were made in the Punta district, where many shops were built. Bastia and the whole island came under French military domination on 8 May 1769.\nIn 1794, during a war with Revolutionary France, British troops under Admiral Nelson and Lieutenant-General David Dundas briefly captured Bastia.\nIn 1848, Bastia took 44 hectares from Ville-di-Pietrabugno.\nGeography.\nLocated in the North-East of Corsica at the base of the Cap Corse, between the sea and the mountain, Bastia is the principal port of the island. The city is located away from the northern tip of the Cap Corse, west from Elba, an Italian island, and away from continental Italy which can be seen a few days per year when visibility is excellent.\nIn terms of geography, Bastia is defined by its position between the sea and the mountain. The city is located on the Eastern side of the \"Serra di Pignu\", a mountain (see photo opposite). This steep mountain and several hills in the city shape a relief typical of the Cap Corse. This pronounced landscape caused the city to develop mostly on a coastal band about wide, which is a very limited part of the that the commune has.\nAbove all, Bastia is a port, and the sea has of course a significant role in the spatial organization of the city. Bastia possesses nowadays three different ports. The old port (\"Vieux Port\" in French and \"Portu Vechju\" in Corsican), located in a remarkable and narrow cove, offers good natural shelter against the climatic hazards of the Mediterranean Sea. Thus, it was at the core of the initial development of the city. Nowadays, many pleasure and fishing boats are still there, but it is not as economically vital than the other more modern ports, although its touristic and aesthetic charm almost makes the old port the official emblem of the city. In fact, many caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants have moved to its docks to which access is granted by the city for pedestrians only during summer evenings.\nA bit more to the north is located the commercial and ferry port. As a major economic asset of the city, the \"port de commerce\" is the pulse of the city. It is even more so during the summer when ferry arrivals and departures of thousands of passengers and cars can sometimes cause long traffic jams along the north\u2013south axis, the national road RN193. In front of the commercial port, the large Saint-Nicolas square represents the heart of the city. Just north of the commercial port, the Toga marina, named after a city neighborhood, is a harbor for leisure boating activities like sailing and yachting. There are also some bars, restaurants and night clubs on its docks.\nThus, Bastia is organized on a relatively narrow north\u2013south axis which can make access to the city centre difficult under particular circumstances. Nowadays, the city centre is mainly composed of the \"citadelle\", the stronghold, also called Terra-Nova, with the Genoese Governors' Palace, the old port and port quarter and the market plaza, and finally the ensemble of buildings along the \"Boulevard Paoli\", the main commercial street of the city, which lies from the Justice Court to the Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Sebastiani.\nDuring the last few decades, Bastia and its region have experienced a strong demographic growth, which has caused somewhat of a suburban crawl in the south of the city, because of the congestion of the city center.\nGeology and relief.\nThe commune is located in the Alpine Eastern Corsica region which is formed from \"a succession of autochthons (fixed terrain), para-autochtons (weakly displaced terrain) and especially allochthons (highly displaced terrain). The first two coincide roughly with the central depression. The allochhtons are mainly in the area of lustrous schists and ophiolites corresponding to the eastern relief (Cap Corse and Castagniccia)\".\nIts base rests on a granite bedrock (Felsic granites from the Hercynian, plain rocks), which has been covered with oceanic layers of:\nNote the presence of copper ore in Cardo which was once the subject of a concession.\nGeographically, Bastia is characterized by its location between the sea and the mountains. The commune lies on the eastern flank of the \"Serra di Pignu\" a mountain which rises to 960 m above sea level. This steep mountain with other hills around Bastia forms the typical terrain of Cap Corse. This pronounced relief largely explains the development of the city on a coastal strip of about 1.5\u00a0km in width which is a very limited proportion of the 19.38 km2 of the whole commune.\nHydrography.\nThe river network is sparse. There are three small streams (or \"fiumes\") flowing from west to east:\nClimate and vegetation.\nBastia possesses a Mediterranean climate. The average annual temperature is and the average coldest night of the year barely goes below freezing. Winds are frequent and violent, precipitation copious, but there are also 240 sunny days on average per year.\nThe commune has two levels of vegetation as a result of its climate but also the flora:\nTransport.\nRoad transport.\nThere are three main access roads to Bastia:\nBus transport.\nThe urban area of Bastia is served by a bus network with 14 routes operated by the Autobus Bastiais company.\nRail transport.\nThe Bastia railway station belongs to Chemins de fer de la Corse and is located in the city centre. There are services to Ajaccio and Calvi. There are also 7 other Bastia rail stops for suburban services to Casamozza: Lupino, Rivoli, Bassanese, Arinella, Montesoro, Sole-Meo, Erbajolo.\nSea transport.\nDespite its small size the port of Bastia is the busiest French port on the Mediterranean Sea with 2,291,944 passengers in 2011.\nThis makes it the second busiest French port behind Calais (about 15 million passengers).\nPorts served from Bastia are:\nSource: CCI Haute Corse \u2013 Port Statistics 2014 (p.\u00a012)\nDomestic traffic is 47.4% against 52.6% international traffic.\nAs shown in the adjacent diagram, shipping and passenger traffic is characterized by a very marked seasonality. This is explained by the importance of summer tourism for the economy of Corsica. Thus the traffic is multiplied by eleven in the high season (July\u2013August). This seasonality has a very strong impact on the city of Bastia, as on all Corsica. The city must be equipped with the necessary infrastructure to be able to accommodate such numbers of passengers even though it is for a short time each year.\nThere is a clear dominance by Corsica Ferries:\nAir transport.\nThe Bastia \u2013 Poretta Airport is located 16\u00a0km south of the city in the commune of Lucciana. It is the second-largest airport in Corsica by passenger numbers after Ajaccio Napoleon Bonaparte Airport.\nIt serves several French airports including Paris-Orly, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Marseille-Provence, Nice-C\u00f4te d'Azur, and Lyon-Saint-Exupery.\nThere are also some European routes such as London, Geneva, and Cologne. The main airlines are Air Corsica, Air France, EasyJet, Luxair, British Airways, and Volotea.\nAdministration.\nLists of Mayors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Mayors from 1770 to 1941\nThe Hotel de Ville was completed in around 1965.\nSubdivisions.\nThe Agglomeration Community of Bastia includes 5 communes with a total population of 57,276 in 2010.\nBastia is divided into four cantons, Canton of Bastia-1, Canton of Bastia-2, Canton of Bastia-3, and Canton of Bastia-4.\nTwinning.\nBastia has twinning associations with:\nDemographics.\nIn 2017, the commune had 45,715 inhabitants.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEducation.\nThe commune has 10 kindergartens, 13 primary schools, 5 colleges (middle schools), and 7 High schools.\nThere is also a research institute of the engineering school of Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech (ENSAM). This institute was opened in 2000 and offers doctoral programs and specialized Masters in the field of renewable energy.\nBastia is the location of one of five regional institutes of administration (IRA) in France for the training of future administrative officials.\nHealth.\nBastia has a hospital in the Paese Novu district (Falconaja Hospital) and a clinic (Maymard Clinic) in the city centre as well as another clinic specializing in ophthalmology (Filippi clinic) in the Saint-Antoine district.\nAround the city there is also the Zuccarelli Clinic (Toga district) and a polyclinic 2\u00a0km from the centre of town at Furiani.\nSports.\nSC Bastia is the football club for Bastia. The Armand-Cesari Stadium is located in the neighbouring commune of Furiani. The club was a finalist in the UEFA Cup competition in 1978 and winner of the Coupe de France in 1981. They were also finalists in the Coupe de France in 1972 and 2002, Champion of France in Ligue 2 in 1968 and 2012, as well as National Champion of France in 2011. In 2015 SC Bastia played and lost the final of the League Cup against PSG, 20 years after playing them in the same competition in 1995. The club currently plays in the Championnat National, following their demotion from Ligue 2 in the 2016\u201317 season.\nBesides SC Bastia there are two other amateur football clubs: \u00c9F Bastia and another club which used to be known as CA Bastia. CA's highest point was playing in Ligue 2 during the 2013\u201314 season, however immediate relegation from Ligue 2, and further relegation from the Championnat National in 16\u201317 led them to merge with fellow lower league club Borgo, and form FC Bastia-Borgo, who currently play in the Championnat. A fourth club, the \"Football Corsica Club Bastiais\" (FCCB) disappeared after playing in six amateur championships in Corsica in the 1950s Historically each of these four clubs was supported by a different part of the city: the Place Saint-Nicolas district were blue (SC Bastia), the Old Port was black (CA Bastia), the citadel and the Saint Joseph district were white (EF Bastia), and the market area was red (FCCB). Sporting dominance has overshadowed other clubs in Bastia over time. At the end of the 2012/2013 season there were for the first time two professional clubs in Bastia: SC Bastia in Ligue 1 and the CA Bastia promoted from National, for a total of four Corsican professional football clubs (with AC Ajaccio in Ligue 1 and GFC Ajaccio, at that point in Ligue 2).\nBastia was also a city-stage in the Tour de France 2013: the arrival point of the first stage from Porto-Vecchio and starting point for the second to Ajaccio.\nBastia was formerly the headquarters for the French round of the FIA World Rally Championship.\nTown planning.\nBastia is primarily a port city so the sea has a predominant place in the spatial organization of the city. Nowadays Bastia has three different ports.\nThe city centre and outlying urban areas.\nToday the city centre consists mainly of the citadel (also called \"Terra Nova\"), the Palace of the Governors, the Old Port with its surrounding neighbourhood and the market place, and finally all the buildings along the Paoli Boulevard \u2013 the main commercial street of the city which stretches from the courthouse to the Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Sebastiani.\nIn recent decades Bastia and its region have had strong demographic growth which has now grown beyond the municipal boundaries.\nBastia has several hamlets and districts that are, from north to south:\nEconomy.\nThe \"bastiaise\" agglomeration contains most of the few industries that exist in Corsica.

In its recognition of humanity as a participant in (not an enemy of) ecosystems, the movement is centered on ecology, health, as well as human rights.\nThe environmental movement is an international movement, represented by a range of environmental organizations, from enterprises to grassroots and varies from country to country. Due to its large membership, varying and strong beliefs, and occasionally speculative nature, the environmental movement is not always united in its goals. At its broadest, the movement includes private citizens, professionals, religious devotees, politicians, scientists, nonprofit organizations, and individual advocates like former Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson and Rachel Carson in the 20th century.\nSince the 1970s, public awareness, environmental sciences, ecology, and technology have advanced to include modern focus points like ozone depletion, climate change, acid rain, mutation breeding, genetically modified crops and genetically modified livestock.\nThe climate movement can be regarded as a sub-type of the environmental movement.\nScope.\nThe environmental movement contains a number of subcommunities, that have developed with different approaches and philosophies in different parts of the world. Notably, the early environmental movement experienced a deep tension between the philosophies of conservation and broader environmental protection. In recent decades the rise to prominence of environmental justice, indigenous rights and key environmental crises like the climate crises, has led to the development of other environmentalist identities.\nFocus points.\nThe environmental movement is broad in scope and can include any topic related to the environment, conservation, and biology, as well as the preservation of landscapes, flora, and fauna for a variety of purposes and uses. Examples include: \nGenetically modified plants and animals.\nGenetically modified plants and animals are said by some environmentalists to be inherently bad because they are unnatural. Others point out the possible benefits of GM crops such as water conservation through corn modified to be less \"thirsty\" and decreased pesticide use through insect-resistant crops. They also point out that some genetically modified livestock have accelerated growth which means there are shorter production cycles which again results in a more efficient use of feed.\nBesides genetically modified crops and livestock, synthetic biology is also on the rise and environmentalists argue that these also contain risks, if these organisms were ever to end up in nature. This, as unlike with genetically modified organisms, synthetic biology even uses base pairs that do not exist in nature.\nAnti-nuclear movement.\nThe anti-nuclear movement opposes the use of various nuclear technologies. The initial anti-nuclear objective was nuclear disarmament and later the focus began to shift to other issues, mainly opposition to the use of nuclear power. There have been many large anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests. The pro-nuclear movement consists of people, including former opponents of nuclear energy, who calculate that the threat to humanity from climate change is far worse than any risk associated with nuclear energy.\nBy the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence. Although it lacked a single coordinating organization the anti-nuclear movement's efforts gained a great deal of attention, especially in the United Kingdom and United States. In the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, many mass demonstrations took place. The largest one was held in New York City in September 1979 and involved 200,000 people.\nExamples of environmental protests.\nTree sitting is a form of activism in which the protester sits in a tree in an attempt to stop the removal of a tree or to impede the demolition of an area with the longest and most famous tree-sitter being Julia Butterfly Hill, who spent 738 days in a California Redwood, saving a three-acre tract of forest. Also notable is the Yellow Finch tree sit, which was a 932-day blockade of the Mountain Valley Pipeline from 2018 to 2021.\nSit-ins can be used to encourage social change, such as the Greensboro sit-ins, a series of protests in 1960 to stop racial segregation, but can also be used in ecoactivism, as in the Dakota Access Pipeline Protest.\nNotable environmental protests and campaigns include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nThe origins of the environmental movement in Europe and North America lay in Smoke abatement programs in response to increasing levels of smoke pollution in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in coal consumption gave rise to an unprecedented level of air pollution in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.\nCriticisms.\nConservative critics of the movement characterize it as radical and misguided. Especially critics of the United States Endangered Species Act, which has come under scrutiny lately, and the Clean Air Act, which they said conflict with private property rights, corporate profits and the nation's overall economic growth. Critics also challenge the scientific evidence for global warming. They argue that the environmental movement has diverted attention from more pressing issues. Western environmental activists have also been criticized for performative activism, eco-colonialism, and enacting white savior tropes, especially celebrities who promote conservation in developing countries.\nWhen residents living near proposed developments organize opposition they are sometimes called \"NIMBYS\", short for \"not in my back yard\".\nBy country.\nAsia.\nBangladesh.\nMithun Roy Chowdhury, President, Save Nature &amp; Wildlife (SNW), Bangladesh, insisted that the people of Bangladesh raise their voice against Tipaimukh Dam, being constructed by the Government of India. He said the Tipaimukh Dam project will be another \"death trap for Bangladesh like the Farakka Barrage,\" which would lead to an environmental disaster for 50 million people in the Meghna River basin. He said that this project will start desertification in Bangladesh.\nBangladesh was ranked the most polluted country in the world due to defective automobiles, particularly diesel-powered vehicles, and hazardous gases from industry. The air is a hazard to Bangladesh's human health, ecology, and economic progress.\nChina.\nChina's environmental movement is becoming stronger, with the establishment of environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are advocating policy changes and placing environmental causes on the national agenda. These activists have the tendency to spontaneously join with local citizens, specialists, as well as other actors to work on specific environmental concerns. Grassroots mobilization and protests have also become more common, frequently focusing on localized concerns such as pollution, forest depletion, or biodiversity conservation. Such campaigns may not necessarily attract extensive national media coverage, but collectively they promote environmental awareness and promote sustainability in China. Environmental protests in China are increasingly expanding their scope of concerns, calling for broader participation \"in the name of the public.\"\nThe Chinese have realized the ability of riots and protests to have success and had led to an increase in disputes in China by 30% since 2005 to more than 50,000 events. Protests cover topics such as environmental issues, land loss, income, and political issues. They have also grown in size from about 10 people or fewer in the mid-1990s to 52 people per incident in 2004. China has more relaxed environmental laws than other countries in Asia, so many polluting factories have relocated to China, causing pollution in China.\nWater pollution, water scarcity, soil pollution, soil degradation, and desertification are issues currently in discussion in China. The groundwater table of the North China Plain is dropping by 1.5\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft) per year. This groundwater table occurs in the region of China that produces 40% of the country's grain. The Center for Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims works to confront legal issues associated with environmental justice by hearing court cases that expose the narratives of victims of environmental pollution. As China continues domestic economic reforms and integration into global markets, there emerge new linkages between China's domestic environmental degradation and global ecological crisis.\nComparing the experience of China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan reveals that the impact of environmental activism is heavily modified by domestic political context, particularly the level of integration of mass-based protests and policy advocacy NGOs. Hinted by the history of neighboring Japan and South Korea, the possible convergence of NGOs and anti-pollution protests will have significant implications for Chinese environmental politics in the coming years.\nIndia.\nEnvironmental and public health is an ongoing struggle within India. The first seed of an environmental movement in India was the foundation in 1964 of \"Dasholi Gram Swarajya Sangh\", a labour cooperative started by Chandi Prasad Bhatt. It was inaugurated by Sucheta Kriplani and founded on land donated by Shyma Devi. This initiative was eventually followed up with the Chipko movement starting in 1974.\nThe most severe single event underpinning the movement was the Bhopal gas leakage on 3 December 1984. 40 tons of methyl isocyanate was released, immediately killing 2,259 people and ultimately affecting 700,000 citizens.\nIndia has a national campaign against Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola plants due to their practices of drawing groundwater and contaminating fields with sludge. The movement is characterized by local struggles against intensive aquaculture farms. The most influential part of the environmental movement in India is the anti-dam movement. Dam creation has been thought of as a way for India to catch up with the West by connecting to the power grid with giant dams, coal or oil-powered plants, or nuclear plants. Jhola Aandolan a mass movement is conducting as fighting against polyethylene carry bags uses and promoting cloth/jute/paper carry bags to protect the environment and nature. Activists in the Indian environmental movement consider global warming, sea levels rising, and glaciers retreating decreasing the amount of water flowing into streams to be the biggest challenges for them to face in the early twenty-first century.\nEco Revolution movement has been started by https:// in 2008 from Aurangabad Maharashtra that seeks the participation of children, youth, researchers, spiritual and political leaders to organise awareness programmes and conferences. Child activists against air pollution in India and greenhouse gas emissions by India include Licypriya Kangujam. From the mid to late 2010s a coalition of urban and Indigenous communities came together to protect Aarey, a forest located in the suburbs of Mumbai. Farming and indigenous communities have also opposed pollution and clearing caused by mining in states such as Goa, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh.\nMiddle East.\nEnvironmental activism in the Arab world, including Middle East and North Africa (MENA), mobilizes around issues such as industrial pollution, and insistence that the government provides irrigation.\nThe League of Arab States has one specialized sub-committee, of 12 standing specialized subcommittees in the Foreign Affairs Ministerial Committees, which deals with Environmental Issues. Countries in the League of Arab States have demonstrated an interest in environmental issues, on paper some environmental activists have doubts about the level of commitment to environmental issues; being a part of the world community may have obliged these countries to portray concern for the environment. The initial level of environmental awareness may be the creation of a ministry of the environment. The year of establishment of a ministry is also indicative of the level of engagement. Saudi Arabia was the first to establish environmental law in 1992 followed by Egypt in 1994. Somalia is the only country without environmental law. In 2010 the Environmental Performance Index listed Algeria as the top Arab country at 42 of 163; Morocco was at 52 and Syria at 56. The Environmental Performance Index measures the ability of a country to actively manage and protect its environment and the health of its citizens. A weighted index is created by giving 50% weight for environmental health objective (health) and 50% for ecosystem vitality (ecosystem); values range from 0\u2013100. No Arab countries were in the top quartile, and 7 countries were in the lowest quartile.\nSouth Korea and Taiwan.\nSouth Korea and Taiwan experienced similar growth in industrialization from 1965 to 1990 with few environmental controls. South Korea's Han River and Nakdong River were so polluted by unchecked dumping of industrial waste that they were close to being classified as biologically dead. Taiwan's formula for balanced growth was to prevent industrial concentration and encourage manufacturers to set up in the countryside. This led to 20% of the farmland being polluted by industrial waste and 30% of the rice grown on the island was contaminated with heavy metals. Both countries had spontaneous environmental movements drawing participants from different classes. Their demands were linked with issues of employment, occupational health, and agricultural crisis. They were also quite militant; the people learned that protesting can bring results. The polluting factories were forced to make immediate improvements to the conditions or pay compensation to victims. Some were even forced to shut down or move locations. The people were able to force the government to come out with new restrictive rules on toxins, industrial waste, and air pollution. All of these new regulations caused the migration of those polluting industries from Taiwan and South Korea to China and other countries in Southeast Asia with more relaxed environmental laws.\nConservation movements in India and Burma during Colonial times.\nThe modern conservation movement was manifested in the forests of India, with the practical application of scientific conservation principles. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: human activity damaged the environment, there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations, and scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. James Ranald Martin was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of Forest Departments.\nThe Madras Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by Alexander Gibson, a professional botanist who systematically adopted a forest conservation programme based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world. Eventually, the government under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation programme in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to other colonies, as well as the United States. In 1860, the Department banned the use of shifting cultivation. Hugh Cleghorn's 1861 manual, \"The forests and gardens of South India\", became the definitive work on the subject and was widely used by forest assistants in the subcontinent.\nDietrich Brandis joined the British service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern Burma. During that time Burma's teak forests were controlled by militant Karen tribals. He introduced the \"taungya\" system, in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting, and weeding teak plantations. Also, he formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. Brandis as well as founded the Imperial Forestry School at Dehradun.\nAfrica.\nSouth Africa.\nIn 2022, a court in South Africa has confirmed the constitutional right of the country's citizens to an environment that is not harmful to their health, which includes the right to clean air. The case is referred to \"Deadly Air\" case. The area includes one of South Africa's largest cities, Ekurhuleni, and a large portion of the Mpumalanga province.\nAmericas.\nLatin America.\nAfter the International Environmental Conference in Stockholm in 1972 Latin American officials returned with a high hope of growth and protection of the fairly untouched natural resources. Governments spent millions of dollars, and created departments and pollution standards. However, the outcomes have not always been what officials had initially hoped. Activists blame this on growing urban populations and industrial growth. Many Latin American countries have had a large inflow of immigrants that are living in substandard housing. Enforcement of the pollution standards is lax and penalties are minimal; in Venezuela, the largest penalty for violating an environmental law is 50,000 bolivar fine ($3,400) and three days in jail. In the 1970s or 1980s, many Latin American countries were transitioning from military dictatorships to democratic governments.\nBrazil.\nIn 1992, Brazil came under scrutiny with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil has a history of little environmental awareness. It has the highest biodiversity in the world and also the highest amount of habitat destruction. One-third of the world's forests lie in Brazil. It is home to the largest river, The Amazon, and the largest rainforest, the Amazon rainforest. People have raised funds to create state parks and increase the consciousness of people who have destroyed forests and polluted waterways. From 1973 to the 1990s, and then in the 2000s, indigenous communities and rubber tappers also carried out blockades that protected much rainforest. It is home to several organizations that have fronted the environmental movement. The Blue Wave Foundation was created in 1989 and has partnered with advertising companies to promote national education campaigns to keep Brazil's beaches clean. Funatura was created in 1986 and is a wildlife sanctuary program. Pro-Natura International is a private environmental organization created in 1986.\nFrom the late 2000s onwards community resistance saw the formerly pro-mining southeastern state of Minas Gerais cancel a number of projects that threatened to destroy forests. In northern Brazil\u2019s Par\u00e1 state the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (Landless Workers Movement) and others campaigned and took part in occupations and blockades against the environmentally harmful Caraj\u00e1s iron ore mine.\nUnited States.\nThe movement in the United States began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as John Muir and Henry David Thoreau making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the 1854 book \"Walden\", which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in Yosemite Valley and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form Yosemite National Park and went on to set up the Sierra Club in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature became the bedrock of modern environmentalism.\nBeginning in the conservation movement at the beginning of the 20th century, the contemporary environmental movement's roots can be traced back to Rachel Carson's 1962 book \"Silent Spring\", Murray Bookchin's 1962 book \"Our Synthetic Environment\", and Paul R. Ehrlich's 1968 \"The Population Bomb\". American environmentalists have campaigned against nuclear weapons and nuclear power in the 1960s and 1970s, acid rain in the 1980s, ozone depletion and deforestation in the 1990s, and most recently climate change and global warming. Individuals such as Hope Sawyer Buyukmihci and Dorothy Richardson have attempted to change attitudes towards individual species of animal experiencing habitat loss and over-exploitation. \nThe United States passed many pieces of environmental legislation in the 1970s, such as the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. These remain as the foundations for current environmental standards.\nIn the 1990s, the anti-environmental 'Wise Use' movement emerged in the United States.\nEurope.\nThe EU's environmental policy was formally founded by a European Council declaration and the first five-year environment programme was adopted. The polluter pays principle was well established in environmental economics before it was included in the Single European Act. Following the 1973 oil crisis the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) passed groundbreaking laws on energy efficiency.\nGermany.\nDuring the 1930s the Nazis had elements that were supportive of animal rights, zoos and wildlife, and took several measures to ensure their protection. In 1933 the government created a stringent animal-protection law and in 1934, (The Reich Hunting Law) was enacted which limited hunting. Several Nazis were environmentalists (notably Rudolf Hess), and species protection and animal welfare were significant issues in the regime. In 1935, the regime enacted the \"Reich Nature Protection Act\" ('). The concept of the ' (best translated as the \"perpetual forest\") which included concepts such as forest management and protection was promoted and efforts were also made to curb air pollution.\nSpain.\nDuring the Spanish Revolution in 1936, anarchist-controlled territories undertook several environmental reforms, which were possibly the largest in the world at the time. Daniel Guerin notes that anarchist territories would diversify crops, extend irrigation, initiate reforestation, start tree nurseries and help to establish naturist communities. Once there was a link discovered between air pollution and tuberculosis, the CNT shut down several metal factories.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe late 19th century saw the formation of the first wildlife conservation societies. The zoologist Alfred Newton published a series of investigations into the \"Desirability of establishing a 'Close-time' for the preservation of indigenous animals\" between 1872 and 1903. His advocacy for legislation to protect animals from hunting during the mating season led to the formation of the Plumage League (later the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) in 1889. The society acted as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing. The Society campaigned for greater protection for the indigenous birds of the island. The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes, and influenced the passage of the Sea Birds Preservation Act in 1869 as the first nature protection law in the world. It also attracted support from many other influential figures, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton. By 1900, public support for the organisation had grown, and it had over 25,000 members. The garden city movement incorporated many environmental concerns into its urban planning manifesto; the Socialist League and The Clarion movement also began to advocate measures of nature conservation.\nFor most of the century from 1850 to 1950, however, the primary environmental cause was the mitigation of air pollution. The Coal Smoke Abatement Society was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir William Blake Richmond, frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the Public Health Act 1875 required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke.\nSystematic and general efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century; it grew out of the amenity movement in Britain in the 1870s, which was a reaction to industrialization, the growth of cities, and worsening air and water pollution. Starting with the formation of the Commons Preservation Society in 1865, the movement championed rural preservation against the encroachments of industrialisation. Robert Hunter, solicitor for the society, worked with Hardwicke Rawnsley, Octavia Hill, and John Ruskin to lead a successful campaign to prevent the construction of railways to carry slate from the quarries, which would have ruined the unspoilt valleys of Newlands and Ennerdale. This success led to the formation of the Lake District Defence Society (later to become The Friends of the Lake District).\nIn 1893 Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley agreed to set up a national body to coordinate environmental conservation efforts across the country; the \"National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty\" was formally inaugurated in 1894. The organisation obtained secure footing through the 1907 National Trust Bill, which gave the trust the status of a statutory corporation. and the bill was passed in August 1907.\nEarly interest in the environment was a feature of the Romantic movement in the early 19th century. The poet William Wordsworth had travelled extensively in England's Lake District and wrote that it is a \"sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy\".\nAn early \"Back-to-Nature\" movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as John Ruskin, William Morris, George Bernard Shaw and Edward Carpenter, who were all against consumerism, pollution and other activities that were harmful to the natural world. The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns, where sanitation was awful, pollution levels intolerable and housing terribly cramped. Idealists championed the rural life as a mythical utopia and advocated a return to it. John Ruskin argued that people should return to a \"small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful, and fruitful. We will have no steam engines upon it ... we will have plenty of flowers and vegetables ... we will have some music and poetry; the children will learn to dance to it and sing it.\" Ruskin moved out of London and together with his friends started to think about the post-industrial society. The predictions Ruskin made for the post-coal utopia coincided with forecasting published by the economist William Stanley Jevons. Practical ventures in the establishment of small cooperative farms were even attempted and old rural traditions, without the \"taint of manufacture or the canker of artificiality\", were enthusiastically revived, including the Morris dance and the maypole.\nThe Coal Smoke Abatement Society (now Environmental Protection UK) was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir William Blake Richmond, frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the Public Health Act 1875 required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. This law's provisions were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash, and gritty particles, and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.\nIt was only under the impetus of the Great Smog of 1952 in London, which almost brought the city to a standstill and may have caused upward of 6,000 deaths, that the Clean Air Act 1956 was passed and airborne pollution in the city was first tackled. Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires) or those who preferred, to burn coke instead (a byproduct of town gas production) which produces minimal smoke. 'Smoke control areas' were introduced in some towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be burnt and power stations were relocated away from cities. The act formed an important impetus to modern environmentalism and caused a rethinking of the dangers of environmental degradation to people's quality of life.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The difference between a probability measure and the more general notion of measure (which includes concepts like area or volume) is that a probability measure must assign value 1 to the entire space.\nIntuitively, the additivity property says that the probability assigned to the union of two disjoint (mutually exclusive) events by the measure should be the sum of the probabilities of the events; for example, the value assigned to the outcome \"1 or 2\" in a throw of a die should be the sum of the values assigned to the outcomes \"1\" and \"2\".\nProbability measures have applications in diverse fields, from physics to finance and biology.\nDefinition.\nThe requirements for a set function formula_1 to be a probability measure on a \u03c3-algebra are that:\nFor example, given three elements 1, 2 and 3 with probabilities formula_9 and formula_10 the value assigned to formula_11 is formula_12 as in the diagram on the right.\nThe conditional probability based on the intersection of events defined as:\nformula_13\nsatisfies the probability function requirements so long as formula_14 is not zero.\nProbability measures are distinct from the more general notion of fuzzy measures in which there is no requirement that the fuzzy values sum up to formula_15 and the additive property is replaced by an order relation based on set inclusion.\nExample applications.\nIn many cases, statistical physics uses \"probability measures\", but not all measures it uses are probability measures. \n\"Market measures\" which assign probabilities to financial market spaces based on observed market movements are examples of probability measures which are of interest in mathematical finance; for example, in the pricing of financial derivatives. For instance, a risk-neutral measure is a probability measure which assumes that the current value of assets is the expected value of the future payoff taken with respect to that same risk neutral measure (i.e. calculated using the corresponding risk neutral density function), and discounted at the risk-free rate. If there is a unique probability measure that must be used to price assets in a market, then the market is called a complete market.\nNot all measures that intuitively represent chance or likelihood are probability measures. For instance, although the fundamental concept of a system in statistical mechanics is a measure space, such measures are not always probability measures. In statistical physics, for sentences of the form \"the probability of a system S assuming state A is p,\" the geometry of the system does not always lead to the definition of a probability measure under congruence, although it may do so in the case of systems with just one degree of freedom.\nProbability measures are also used in mathematical biology. For instance, in comparative sequence analysis a probability measure may be defined for the likelihood that a variant may be permissible for an amino acid in a sequence.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Any painting media \u2013 oils, acrylics, watercolors, gouache, etc. \u2013 can produce either linear or painterly work. Some artists whose work could be characterized as painterly are Pierre Bonnard, Francis Bacon, Vincent van Gogh, Rembrandt, Renoir, John Singer Sargent, and Andrew Wyeth (his early watercolors). The Impressionists, Fauvists and the Abstract Expressionists tended strongly to be painterly.\nPainterly art often makes use of the many visual effects produced by paint on canvas, such as chromatic progression, warm and cool tones, complementary and contrasting colors, broken tones, broad brushstrokes, sketchiness, and impasto.\nLinear art.\nThe opposite of painterly is \"linear\", \"plastic\" or \"formal linear\" design.\n\"Linear\" could describe the painting of artists such as Botticelli, Michelangelo, and Ingres, whose works depend on creating the illusion of a degree of three-dimensionality by means of \"modeling the form\" through skillful drawing, shading, and an academic (rather than impulsive) use of color. Contour and pattern are more the province of linear artists, while dynamism is the most common painterly trait.\nOther usage.\nAlthough \"painterly\" generally refers to a certain use of paint in art, it happens that some forms of sculpture make use of apparently random surface effects which, if not exactly resembling brushstrokes, contain the traits of painterliness. The application of the term outside the realm of painting may help the viewer, or listener, experience more deeply the significance of Auguste Rodin's surfaces or Richard Strauss's flow of chromatic harmonies.\nMore recently, \"painterly\" is used to describe computer software, especially mobile apps, designed to create special effects on photographs, mimicking recognizable artistic media such as oils, watercolors, Japanese woodcuts, etc., or based on individual styles like van Gogh, Monet, and so on. The resulting photographs, once transformed, are also called \"painterly\".\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "45440", "revid": "35498106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45440", "title": "Physiocracy", "text": "School of thought in economics\nPhysiocracy (; from the Greek for \"government of nature\") is an economic theory developed by a group of 18th-century Age of Enlightenment French economists. They believed that the wealth of nations derived solely from the value of \"land agriculture\" or \"land development\" and that agricultural products should be highly priced. Their theories originated in France and were most popular during the second half of the 18th century. Physiocracy became one of the first well-developed theories of economics.\nFran\u00e7ois Quesnay (1694\u20131774), the Marquis de Mirabeau (1715\u20131789) and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (1727\u20131781) dominated the movement, which immediately preceded the first modern school, classical economics, which began with the publication of Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\" in 1776.\nThe physiocrats made a significant contribution in their emphasis on productive work as the source of national wealth. This contrasted with earlier schools, in particular mercantilism, which often focused on the ruler's wealth, accumulation of gold, or the balance of trade. Whereas the mercantilist school of economics held that value in the products of society was created at the point of sale, by the seller exchanging his products for more money than the products had \"previously\" been worth, the physiocratic school of economics was the first to see labor as the sole source of value. However, for the physiocrats, only agricultural labor created this value in the products of society. All \"industrial\" and non-agricultural labors were \"unproductive appendages\" to agricultural labor.\nQuesnay was likely influenced by his medical training, particularly by the work of William Harvey who explained how blood flow and the circulatory system is vital to the human body; Quesnay held that the circulation of wealth was vital to the economy. Societies at the time were also overwhelmingly agrarian. This may be why they viewed agriculture as the primary source of a nation's wealth. This is an idea which Quesnay purported to demonstrate with data, comparing a workshop to a farm. He analyzed \"how money flowed between the three classes of farmers, proprietors, and artisans, in the same mechanical way that blood flows between different organs\" and claimed only the farm produced a surplus that added to the nation's wealth. Physiocrats viewed the production of goods and services as equivalent to the consumption of the agricultural surplus, since human or animal muscle provided the main source of power and all energy derived from the surplus from agricultural production. Profit in capitalist production was really only the \"rent\" obtained by the owner of the land on which the agricultural production took place.\n\"The physiocrats damned cities for their artificiality and praised more natural styles of living. They celebrated farmers.\" They called themselves \"les \u00c9conomistes\", but are generally referred to as \"physiocrats\" to distinguish their beliefs from the many schools of economic thought that followed.\nPrecursors.\nPhysiocracy is an agrarianist philosophy which developed in the context of the predominantly rural, pre-industrial European society of the time. In the late Roman Republic, the dominant senatorial class was not allowed to engage in banking or commerce but relied on their \"latifundia\", large plantations, for income. They circumvented this rule through freedmen proxies who sold surplus agricultural goods.\nOther inspiration came from China's economic system, then the largest in the world. Chinese society broadly distinguished four occupations, with scholar-bureaucrats (who were also agrarian landlords) at the top and merchants at the bottom (because they did not produce but only distributed goods made by others). Leading physiocrats like Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay were avid Confucianists who advocated China's agrarian policies. Some scholars have advocated connections with the school of agriculturalism, which promoted utopian communalism. One of the integral parts of physiocracy, laissez-faire, was adopted from Quesnay's writings on China, being a translation of the Chinese Taoism term wu wei. The concept natural order of physiocracy originated from \"Way of Nature\" of Chinese Taoism.\nHistory.\nThe growing power of the centralized state control in the era of enlightened absolutism necessitated centralized, systematic information on the nation. A major innovation was the collection, use and interpretation of numerical and statistical data, ranging from trade statistics, harvest reports, and death notices to population censuses. Starting in the 1760s, officials in France and Germany began increasingly to rely on quantitative data for systematic planning, especially regarding long-term economic growth. It combined the utilitarian agenda of \"enlightened absolutism\" with the new ideas being developed in economics. In Germany the trend was especially strong in Cameralism while in France it was an important theme in physiocracy.\nPierre Le Pesant, sieur de Boisguilbert served as a member of Louis XIV's local administration of Paris, and wrote pamphlets and booklets on subjects related to his work: taxation, grain trade, and money. Le Pesant asserted that wealth came from self-interest and markets were connected by money flows (i.e. an expense for the buyer is revenue for the producer). Thus he realized that lowering prices in times of shortage \u2013 common at the time \u2013 was dangerous economically as it acted as a disincentive to production. Generally, Le Pesant advocated less government interference in the grain market, as any such interference would generate \"anticipations\" which would prevent the policy from working.\nFor instance, if the government bought corn abroad, some people would speculate that there was likely to be a shortage and would buy more corn, leading to higher prices and more of a shortage. This was an early example of advocacy of free trade. In anonymously published tracts, Vauban proposed a system known as ('the royal tithe'): this involved major simplification of the French tax code by switching to a relatively flat tax on property and trade. Vauban's use of statistics contrasted with earlier empirical methods in economics.\nThe event that led Mirabeau to devote himself to political economy was undoubtedly his work on a manuscript of Richard Cantillon's (\"Essay on the nature of commerce in general\"), which he had in his possession as early as 1740. He elaborated a commentary of this text that gradually became his (\"Friend of men\").\nAround the time of the Seven Years' War between France and England (1756\u20131763), the physiocracy movement grew. Several journals appeared, signaling an increasing audience in France for new economic ideas. Among the most important were the (1721\u20131772), which promoted agronomy and rational husbandry, and the (1759\u20131762), which was heavily influenced by the Irishman Richard Cantillon (1680\u20131734), both dominated by physiocrats; the (1765\u20131774) and the (\"Citizen's Ephemeris\"; 1767\u20131772 and 1774\u20131776).\nAlso, Vincent de Gournay (1712\u20131759), the Intendant du commerce, brought together a group of young researchers including Fran\u00e7ois V\u00e9ron Duverger de Forbonnais (1722\u20131800) and one of the two most famous physiocrats, Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (1727\u20131781). The other, Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay (1694\u20131774), was among those writing prolifically in contemporaneous journals.\n\"Tableau \u00e9conomique\".\nThe \"Tableau \u00e9conomique\" or \"Economic Table\" is an economic model first described by Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay in 1759, which laid the foundation of the physiocrats' economic theories. It also contains the origins of modern ideas on the circulation of wealth and the nature of interrelationships in the economy.\nThe model Quesnay created consisted of three economic agents: the \"proprietary\" class consisted only of landowners; the \"productive\" class consisted of agricultural laborers; the \"sterile\" class was made up of artisans and merchants. The flow of production and cash between the three classes originated with the proprietary class because they owned the land and bought from both of the other classes.\nCharacteristics.\nNatural order.\nThe physiocrats thought there was a \"natural order\" that allowed human beings to live together. Men did not come together via a somewhat arbitrary \"social contract.\" Rather, they had to discover the laws of the natural order that would allow individuals to live in society without losing significant freedoms. This concept of natural order had originated in China. The Chinese had believed that there can be good government only when a perfect harmony exists between the \"Way of Man\" (governmental institutions) and the \"Way of Nature\" (Quesnay's natural order).\nIndividualism and laissez-faire.\nThe physiocrats, especially Turgot, believed that self-interest was the motivation for each segment of the economy to play its role. Each individual is best suited to determine what goods they want and what work would provide them with what they want out of life. While a person might labor for the benefit of others, they will work harder for their own benefit; however, each person's needs are being supplied by many other people. The system works best when there is a complementary relationship between one person's needs and another person's desires, and so trade restrictions place an unnatural barrier to achieving one's goals. Laissez-faire was popularized by physiocrat Vincent de Gournay who is said to have adopted the term from Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay's writings on China.\nPrivate property.\nNone of the theories concerning the value of land could work without strong legal support for the ownership of private property. Combined with the strong sense of individualism, private property becomes a critical component of the Tableau's functioning.\nThe physiocrats believed in the institution of private property. They saw property as a tree and its branches, as social institutions.\nThey actually stated that landlords must enjoy 2/5 on the land surpluses. They also advocated that landlords should be given dues, otherwise they would take the land away from the cultivators.\nDiminishing returns.\nTurgot was one of the first to recognize that \"successive applications of the variable input will cause the product to grow, first at an increasing rate, later at a diminishing rate until it reaches a maximum.\" This was a recognition that the productivity gains required to increase national wealth had an ultimate limit, and, therefore, wealth could not be infinite.\nInvestment capital.\nBoth Quesnay and Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune recognized that capital was needed by farmers to start the production process, and both were proponents of using some of each year's profits to increase productivity. Capital was also needed to sustain the laborers while they produced their product. Turgot recognizes that there is opportunity cost and risk involved in using capital for something other than land ownership, and he promotes interest as serving a \"strategic function in the economy.\"\nSubsequent developments.\nThe ideas of the Physiocrats had an influence on Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and above all Henry George, who appears at first to have come to similar beliefs independently. George was the driving force behind what became known as the Single Tax movement (not to be confused with Flat Tax). The Single Tax is a proposal for the use of the annual rental value of land (land value taxation) as the principal or sole source of public revenue.\n\"The New Physiocratic League\" is a current Georgist political movement which seeks to revive elements of physiocracy.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Conservationists are concerned with leaving the environment in a better state than the condition they found it in. Evidence-based conservation seeks to use high quality scientific evidence to make conservation efforts more effective.\nThe early conservation movement evolved out of necessity to maintain natural resources such as fisheries, wildlife management, water, soil, as well as conservation and sustainable forestry. The contemporary conservation movement has broadened from the early movement's emphasis on use of sustainable yield of natural resources and preservation of wilderness areas to include preservation of biodiversity. Some say the conservation movement is part of the broader and more far-reaching environmental movement, while others argue that they differ both in ideology and practice.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe conservation movement can be traced back to John Evelyn's work \"Sylva\", which was presented as a paper to the Royal Society in 1662. Published as a book two years later, it was one of the most highly influential texts on forestry ever published. Timber resources in England were becoming dangerously depleted at the time, and Evelyn advocated the importance of conserving the forests by managing the rate of depletion and ensuring that the cut down trees get replenished.\nKhejarli massacre:\nThe Bishnoi narrate the story of Amrita Devi, a member of the sect who inspired as many as 363 other Bishnois to go to their deaths in protest of the cutting down of Khejri trees on 12 September 1730. The Maharaja of Jodhpur, Abhay Singh, requiring wood for the construction of a new palace, sent soldiers to cut trees in the village of Khejarli, which was called Jehnad at that time. Noticing their actions, Amrita Devi hugged a tree in an attempt to stop them. Her family then adopted the same strategy, as did other local people when the news spread. She told the soldiers that she considered their actions to be an insult to her faith and that she was prepared to die to save the trees. The soldiers did indeed kill her and others until Abhay Singh was informed of what was going on and intervened to stop the massacre.\nSome of the 363 Bishnois who were killed protecting the trees were buried in Khejarli, where a simple grave with four pillars was erected. Every year, in September, i.e., Shukla Dashmi of Bhadrapad (Hindi month) the Bishnois assemble there to commemorate the sacrifice made by their people to preserve the trees.\nThe field developed during the 18th century, especially in Prussia and France where scientific forestry methods were developed. These methods were first applied rigorously in British India from the early 19th century. The government was interested in the use of forest produce and began managing the forests with measures to reduce the risk of wildfire in order to protect the \"household\" of nature, as it was then termed. This early ecological idea was in order to preserve the growth of delicate teak trees, which was an important resource for the Royal Navy.\nConcerns over teak depletion were raised as early as 1799 and 1805 when the Navy was undergoing a massive expansion during the Napoleonic Wars; this pressure led to the first formal conservation Act, which prohibited the felling of small teak trees. The first forestry officer was appointed in 1806 to regulate and preserve the trees necessary for shipbuilding.\nThis promising start received a setback in the 1820s and 30s, when laissez-faire economics and complaints from private landowners brought these early conservation attempts to an end.\nIn 1837, American poet George Pope Morris published \"Woodman, Spare that Tree!\", a Romantic poem urging a lumberjack to avoid an oak tree that has sentimental value. The poem was set to music later that year by Henry Russell. Lines from the song have been quoted by environmentalists.\nOrigins of the modern conservation movement.\nConservation was revived in the mid-19th century, with the first practical application of scientific conservation principles to the forests of India. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the environment, that there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir James Ranald Martin was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of Forest Departments. Edward Percy Stebbing warned of desertification of India. The Madras Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by Alexander Gibson, a professional botanist who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world.\nThese local attempts gradually received more attention by the British government as the unregulated felling of trees continued unabated. In 1850, the British Association in Edinburgh formed a committee to study forest destruction at the behest of Hugh Cleghorn a pioneer in the nascent conservation movement.\nHe had become interested in forest conservation in Mysore in 1847 and gave several lectures at the Association on the failure of agriculture in India. These lectures influenced the government under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie to introduce the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to other colonies, as well the United States. In the same year, Cleghorn organised the Madras Forest Department and in 1860 the department banned the use shifting cultivation. Cleghorn's 1861 manual, \"The forests and gardens of South India\", became the definitive work on the subject and was widely used by forest assistants in the subcontinent. In 1861, the Forest Department extended its remit into the Punjab.\nSir Dietrich Brandis, a German forester, joined the British service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern Burma. During that time Burma's teak forests were controlled by militant Karen tribals. He introduced the \"taungya\" system, in which Karen villagers provided labor for clearing, planting and weeding teak plantations. After seven years in Burma, Brandis was appointed Inspector General of Forests in India, a position he served in for 20 years. He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. The Imperial Forest School at Dehradun was founded by him.\nGermans were prominent in the forestry administration of British India. As well as Brandis, Berthold Ribbentrop and Sir William P.D. Schlich brought new methods to Indian conservation, the latter becoming the Inspector-General in 1883 after Brandis stepped down. Schlich helped to establish the journal \"Indian Forester\" in 1874, and became the founding director of the first forestry school in England at Cooper's Hill in 1885. He authored the five-volume \"Manual of Forestry\" (1889\u201396) on silviculture, forest management, forest protection, and forest utilization, which became the standard and enduring textbook for forestry students.\nConservation in the United States.\nThe American movement received its inspiration from 19th century works that exalted the inherent value of nature, quite apart from human usage. Author Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862) made key philosophical contributions that exalted nature. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book \"Walden,\" which argued that people should become intimately close with nature. The ideas of Sir Brandis, Sir William P.D. Schlich and Carl A. Schenck were also very influential\u2014Gifford Pinchot, the first chief of the USDA Forest Service, relied heavily upon Brandis' advice for introducing professional forest management in the U.S. and on how to structure the Forest Service. In 1864 Abraham Lincoln established the federally preserved Yosemite, before the first national park was created (Yellowstone National Park).\nBoth conservationists and preservationists appeared in political debates during the Progressive Era (the 1890s\u2013early 1920s). There were three main positions.\nThe debate between conservation and preservation reached its peak in the public debates over the construction of California's Hetch Hetchy dam in Yosemite National Park which supplies the water supply of San Francisco. Muir, leading the Sierra Club, declared that the valley must be preserved for the sake of its beauty: \"No holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man.\"\nPresident Roosevelt put conservationist issues high on the national agenda. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter, Gifford Pinchot and was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He encouraged the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more federal land for national parks and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined.\nRoosevelt established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of five national parks, and signed the year 1906 Antiquities Act, under which he proclaimed 18 new national monuments. He also established the first 51 bird reserves, four game preserves, and 150 national forests, including Shoshone National Forest, the nation's first. The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately .\nGifford Pinchot had been appointed by McKinley as chief of Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture. In 1905, his department gained control of the national forest reserves. Pinchot promoted private use (for a fee) under federal supervision. In 1907, Roosevelt designated of new national forests just minutes before a deadline.\nIn May 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the Conference of Governors held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: \"Conservation as a National Duty\".\nIn 1903 Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with John Muir, who had a very different view of conservation, and tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests. Working through the Sierra Club he founded, Muir succeeded in 1905 in having Congress transfer the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley to the federal government. While Muir wanted nature preserved for its own sake, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot's formulation, \"to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees.\"\nTheodore Roosevelt's view on conservationism remained dominant for decades; Franklin D. Roosevelt authorised the building of many large-scale dams and water projects, as well as the expansion of the National Forest System to buy out sub-marginal farms. In 1937, the Pittman\u2013Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act was signed into law, providing funding for state agencies to carry out their conservation efforts.\nSince 1970.\nEnvironmental reemerged on the national agenda in 1970, with Republican Richard Nixon playing a major role, especially with his creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. The debates over the public lands and environmental politics played a supporting role in the decline of liberalism and the rise of modern environmentalism. Although Americans consistently rank environmental issues as \"important\", polling data indicates that in the voting booth voters rank the environmental issues low relative to other political concerns.\nThe growth of the Republican party's political power in the inland West (apart from the Pacific coast) was facilitated by the rise of popular opposition to public lands reform. Successful Democrats in the inland West and Alaska typically take more conservative positions on environmental issues than Democrats from the Coastal states. Conservatives drew on new organizational networks of think tanks, industry groups, and citizen-oriented organizations, and they began to deploy new strategies that affirmed the rights of individuals to their property, protection of extraction rights, to hunt and recreate, and to pursue happiness unencumbered by the federal government at the expense of resource conservation.\nIn 2019, convivial conservation was an idea proposed by Bram B\u00fcscher and Robert Fletcher. Convivial conservation draws on social movements and concepts like environmental justice and structural change to create a post-capitalist approach to conservation. Convivial conservation rejects both human-nature dichotomies and capitalistic political economies. Built on a politics of equity, structural change and\u00a0 environmental\u00a0 justice, convivial conservation is considered a radical theory as it focuses on the structural political-economy of modern nation states and the need to create structural change. Convivial conservation creates a more integrated approach which reconfigures the nature-human configuration to create a world in which humans are recognized as a part of nature. The emphasis on nature as for and by humans creates a human responsibility to care for the environment as a way of caring for themselves. It also redefines nature as not only being pristine and untouched, but cultivated by humans in everyday formats. The theory is a long-term process of structural change to move away from capitalist valuation in favor of a system emphasizing everyday and local living. Convivial conservation creates a nature which includes humans rather than excluding them from the necessity of conservation. While other conservation theories integrate some of the elements of convivial conservation, none move away from both dichotomies and capitalist valuation principles.\nThe five elements of convivial conservation.\nSource:\nRacism and the Conservation Movement.\nThe early years of the environmental and conservation movements were rooted in the safeguarding of game to support the recreation activities of elite white men, such as sport hunting. This led to an economy to support and perpetuate these activities as well as the continued wilderness conservation to support the corporate interests supplying the hunters with the equipment needed for their sport. Game parks in England and the United States allowed wealthy hunters and fishermen to deplete wildlife, while hunting by Indigenous groups, laborers and the working class, and poor citizens - especially for the express use of sustenance - was vigorously monitored. Scholars have shown that the establishment of the U.S. national parks, while setting aside land for preservation, was also a continuation of preserving the land for the recreation and enjoyment of elite white hunters and nature enthusiasts.\nWhile Theodore Roosevelt was one of the leading activists for the conservation movement in the United States, he also believed that the threats to the natural world were equally threats to white Americans. Roosevelt and his contemporaries held the belief that the cities, industries and factories that were overtaking the wilderness and threatening the native plants and animals were also consuming and threatening the racial vigor that they believed white Americans held which made them superior. Roosevelt was a big believer that white male virility depended on wildlife for its vigor, and that, consequently, depleting wildlife would result in a racially weaker nation. This lead Roosevelt to support the passing of many immigration restrictions, eugenics legislations and wildlife preservation laws. For instance, Roosevelt established the first national parks through the Antiquities Act of 1906 while also endorsing the removal of Indigenous Americans from their tribal lands within the parks. This move was promoted and endorsed by other leaders of the conservation movement, including Frederick Law Olmsted, a leading landscape architect, conservationist, and supporter of the national park system, and Gifford Pinchot, a leading eugenicist and conservationist. Furthering the economic exploitation of the environment and national parks for wealthy whites was the beginning of ecotourism in the parks, which included allowing some Indigenous Americans to remain so that the tourists could get what was to be considered the full \"wilderness experience\".\nAnother long-term supporter, partner, and inspiration to Roosevelt, Madison Grant, was a well known American eugenicist and conservationist. Grant worked alongside Roosevelt in the American conservation movement and was even secretary and president of the Boone and Crockett Club. In 1916, Grant published the book \"The Passing of the Great Race, or The Racial Basis of European History\", which based its premise on eugenics and outlined a hierarchy of races, with white, \"Nordic\" men at the top, and all other races below. The German translation of this book was used by Nazi Germany as the source for many of their beliefs and was even proclaimed by Hitler to be his \"Bible\".\nOne of the first established conservation agencies in the United States is the National Audubon Society. Founded in 1905, its priority was to protect and conserve various waterbird species. However, the first state-level Audubon group was created in 1896 by Harriet Hemenway and Minna B. Hall to convince women to refrain from buying hats made with bird feathers- a common practice at the time. The organization is named after John Audubon, a naturalist and legendary bird painter. Audubon was also a slaveholder who also included many racist tales in his books. Despite his views of racial inequality, Audubon did find black and Indigenous people to be scientifically useful, often using their local knowledge in his books and relying on them to collect specimens for him.\nThe ideology of the conservation movement in Germany paralleled that of the U.S. and England. Early German naturalists of the 20th century turned to the wilderness to escape the industrialization of cities. However, many of these early conservationists became part of and influenced the Nazi party. Like elite and influential Americans of the early 20th century, they embraced eugenics and racism and promoted the idea that Nordic people are superior.\nWorld Wide Fund for Nature.\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international non-governmental organization founded in 1961, working in the field of the wilderness preservation, and the reduction of human impact on the environment. It was formerly named the \"World Wildlife Fund\", which remains its official name in Canada and the United States.\nWWF is the world's largest conservation organization with over five million supporters worldwide, working in more than 100 countries, supporting around 1,300 conservation and environmental projects. They have invested over $1 billion in more than 12,000 conservation initiatives since 1995. WWF is a foundation with 55% of funding from individuals and bequests, 19% from government sources (such as the World Bank, DFID, USAID) and 8% from corporations in 2014.\nWWF aims to \"stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.\" The Living Planet Report is published every two years by WWF since 1998; it is based on a Living Planet Index and ecological footprint calculation. In addition, WWF has launched several notable worldwide campaigns including Earth Hour and Debt-for-Nature Swap, and its current work is organized around these six areas: food, climate, freshwater, wildlife, forests, and oceans.\n\"Conservation Far\" approach.\nInstitutions such as the WWF have historically been the cause of the displacement and divide between Indigenous populations and the lands they inhabit. The reason is the organization's historically colonial, paternalistic, and neoliberal approaches to conservation. Claus, in her article \"Drawing the Sea Near: Satoumi and Coral Reef Conservation in Okinawa\", expands on this approach, called \"conservation far\", in which access to lands is open to external foreign entities, such as researchers or tourists, but prohibited to local populations. The conservation initiatives are therefore taking place \"far\" away. This entity is largely unaware of the customs and values held by those within the territory surrounding nature and their role within it.\n\"Conservation near\" approach.\nIn Japan, the town of Shiraho had traditional ways of tending to nature that were lost due to colonization and militarization by the United States. The return to traditional sustainability practices constituted a \"conservation near\" approach. This engages those near in proximity to the lands in the conservation efforts and holds them accountable for their direct effects on its preservation. While conservation-far drills visuals and sight as being the main interaction medium between people and the environment, conservation near includes a hands-on, full sensory experience permitted by conservation-near methodologies. An emphasis on observation only stems from a deeper association with intellect and observation. The alternative to this is more of a bodily or \"primitive\" consciousness, which is associated with lower-intelligence and people of color. A new, integrated approach to conservation is being investigated in recent years by institutions such as WWF. The socionatural relationships centered on the interactions based in reciprocity and empathy, making conservation efforts being accountable to the local community and ways of life, changing in response to values, ideals, and beliefs of the locals. Japanese seascapes are often integral to the identity of the residents and includes historical memories and spiritual engagements which need to be recognized and considered. The involvement of communities gives residents a stake in the issue, leading to a long-term solution which emphasizes sustainable resource usage and the empowerment of the communities. Conservation efforts are able to take into consideration cultural values rather than the foreign ideals that are often imposed by foreign activists.\nAreas of concern.\nDeforestation and overpopulation are issues affecting all regions of the world. The consequent destruction of wildlife habitat has prompted the creation of conservation groups in other countries, some founded by local hunters who have witnessed declining wildlife populations first hand. Also, it was highly important for the conservation movement to solve problems of living conditions in the cities and the overpopulation of such places.\nBoreal forest and the Arctic.\nThe idea of incentive conservation is a modern one but its practice has clearly defended some of the sub Arctic wildernesses and the wildlife in those regions for thousands of years, especially by indigenous peoples such as the Evenk, Yakut, Sami, Inuit and Cree. The fur trade and hunting by these peoples have preserved these regions for thousands of years. Ironically, the pressure now upon them comes from non-renewable resources such as oil, sometimes to make synthetic clothing which is advocated as a humane substitute for fur. (See Raccoon dog for case study of the conservation of an animal through fur trade.) Similarly, in the case of the beaver, hunting and fur trade were thought to bring about the animal's demise, when in fact they were an integral part of its conservation. For many years children's books stated and still do, that the decline in the beaver population was due to the fur trade. In reality however, the decline in beaver numbers was because of habitat destruction and deforestation, as well as its continued persecution as a pest (it causes flooding). In Cree lands, however, where the population valued the animal for meat and fur, it continued to thrive. The Inuit defend their relationship with the seal in response to outside critics.\nLatin America (Bolivia).\nThe Izoce\u00f1o-Guaran\u00ed of Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia, is a tribe of hunters who were influential in establishing the Capitania del Alto y Bajo Isoso (CABI). CABI promotes economic growth and survival of the Izoceno people while discouraging the rapid destruction of habitat within Bolivia's Gran Chaco. They are responsible for the creation of the 34,000 square kilometre Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Area (KINP). The KINP protects the most biodiverse portion of the Gran Chaco, an ecoregion shared with Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. In 1996, the Wildlife Conservation Society joined forces with CABI to institute wildlife and hunting monitoring programs in 23 Izoce\u00f1o communities. The partnership combines traditional beliefs and local knowledge with the political and administrative tools needed to effectively manage habitats. The programs rely solely on voluntary participation by local hunters who perform self-monitoring techniques and keep records of their hunts. The information obtained by the hunters participating in the program has provided CABI with important data required to make educated decisions about the use of the land. Hunters have been willing participants in this program because of pride in their traditional activities, encouragement by their communities and expectations of benefits to the area.\nAfrica (Botswana).\nIn order to discourage illegal South African hunting parties and ensure future local use and sustainability, indigenous hunters in Botswana began lobbying for and implementing conservation practices in the 1960s. The Fauna Preservation Society of Ngamiland (FPS) was formed in 1962 by the husband and wife team: Robert Kay and June Kay, environmentalists working in conjunction with the Batawana tribes to preserve wildlife habitat.\nThe FPS promotes habitat conservation and provides local education for preservation of wildlife. Conservation initiatives were met with strong opposition from the Botswana government because of the monies tied to big-game hunting. In 1963, BaTawanga Chiefs and tribal hunter/adventurers in conjunction with the FPS founded Moremi National Park and Wildlife Refuge, the first area to be set aside by tribal people rather than governmental forces. Moremi National Park is home to a variety of wildlife, including lions, giraffes, elephants, buffalo, zebra, cheetahs and antelope, and covers an area of 3,000 square kilometers. Most of the groups involved with establishing this protected land were involved with hunting and were motivated by their personal observations of declining wildlife and habitat.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, some right-wing ones, like nationalism, conservatism, and anti-globalism, along with even some centrist movements, have also adopted autarky, generally on a more limited scale, to develop a particular industry, to gain independence from other national entities or to preserve part of an existing social order.\nProponents of autarky have argued for national self-sufficiency to reduce foreign economic, political, and cultural influences, and to promote international peace. However, economists are generally supportive of free trade; there is broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growth and economic stability.\nAutarky may be a policy of a state or some other type of entity when it seeks to be self-sufficient as a whole, but it also can be limited to a narrow field such as possession of a key raw material. Some countries have a policy of autarky with respect to foodstuffs (such as South Korea), and water for national-security reasons. Autarky can result from economic isolation or from external circumstances in which a state or other entity reverts to localized production when it lacks currency or excess production to trade with the outside world.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"autarky\" is from the Ancient Greek word , which means \"self-sufficiency\" (derived from \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf-, \"self\", and \u1f00\u03c1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9, \"to suffice\"). In Stoicism the concept of autarky represents independence from anything external, including independence from personal relationships, so as to immune one from vagaries of fortune. The Stoic sage is autarkic by being dependent only on his own virtue. In Epicureanism the concept of autarky represents having the fewest possible requirements for living a life of pleasure, free of pain (aponia). \nLexico, whose content is provided by the same publisher as that of the Oxford English Dictionary, says that \"autarky\" is a variant spelling of and pronounced the same as \"autarchy\" and that \"autarchy\" is another term for \"autocracy\".\nHistory.\nAncient and medieval.\nEarly state societies that can be regarded as autarkic include nomadic pastoralism and palace economy, though over time these tend towards becoming less self-sufficient and more interconnected. The late Bronze Age, for example, saw formerly self-sufficient palace economies rely more heavily on trade, which may have been a contributing factor to the eventual Bronze Age Collapse when multiple crises hit those systems at once. After that collapse, the ideal of \"autarkeia\" formed a part of emerging Greek political culture, emphasizing economic self-sufficiency and local self-rule.\nThe populist Chinese philosophy of Agriculturalism, prominent in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, supported egalitarian, self-sufficient societies as an antidote to rampant war and corruption.\nDuring the Late Roman Empire, some rebellions and communities pursued autarky as a reaction both to upheaval and to counter imperial power. A prominent example is the Bacaude, who repeatedly rebelled against the empire and \"formed self-governing communities\" with their own internal economy and coinage.\nMedieval communes combined an attempt at overall economic self-sufficiency through the use of common lands and resources with the use of mutual defense pacts, neighborhood assemblies and organized militias to preserve local autonomy against the depredations of the local nobility. Many of these communes later became trading powers such as the Hanseatic League. In some cases, communal village economies maintained their own debt system as part of a self-sufficient economy and to avoid reliance on possibly hostile aristocratic or business interests. The trend toward \"local self-sufficiency\" increased after the Black Plague, initially as a reaction to the impact of the epidemic and later as a way for communes and city states to maintain power against the nobility.\nThere is considerable debate about how autarkic cultures that resisted the spread of early capitalism were. Golden Age pirate communities have been dubbed both heavily autarkic societies where \"the marauders...lived in small, self-contained democracies\" and as an \"anti-autarky\" due to their dependence on raiding.\nWhile rarer among imperial states, some autarkies did occur during specific time periods. The Ming dynasty, during its earlier, more isolationist period, kept a closed economy that prohibited outside trade and focused on centralized distribution of goods produced in localized farms and workshops. A hierarchy of bureaucrats oversaw the distribution of these resources from central depots, including a massive one located in the Forbidden City. That depot was, at the time, the largest logistical base in the world. The Incan Empire also maintained a system of society-wide autarky based on community levies of specific goods and \"supply on command\".\n19th and early 20th centuries.\nIn some areas of the antebellum South, the enslaved and free black populations forged self-sufficient economies in an effort to avoid reliance on the larger economy controlled by the planter aristocracy. In eastern North Carolina maroon communities, often based in swampy areas, used a combination of agriculture and fishing to forge a \"hidden economy\" and secure survival. The relative self-reliance of these maritime African-American populations provided the basis for a strongly abolitionist political culture that made increasingly radical demands after the start of the Civil War. Due to tense relations with some Union commanders and political factions during and after that war, these communities \"focused their organizing efforts on developing their own institutions, their own sense of self-reliance, and their own political strength\".\nCommunist movements embraced or dismissed autarky as a goal at different times. Peter Kropotkin advocated local and regional autarky integrating agriculture and industry, instead of the international division of labor. His work repeatedly held up communities \"that needed neither aid or protection from without\" as a more resilient model.\nSome socialist communities like Charles Fourier's phalansteries strove for self-sufficiency. The early USSR in the Russian Civil War strove for a self-sufficient economy with war communism, but later pursued international trade vigorously under the New Economic Policy. However, while the Soviet government during the latter period encouraged international trade, it also permitted and even encouraged local autarkies in many peasant villages.\nSometimes leftist groups clashed over autarkic projects. During the Spanish Civil War, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT and the socialist UGT had created economic cooperatives in the Levante that they claimed were \"managing the economic life of the region independent of the government\". But communist factions responded by cracking down on these cooperatives in an attempt to place economic control back in the hands of the central government.\nSome right-wing totalitarian governments have claimed autarky as a goal, developing national industry and imposing high tariffs but have crushed other autarkic movements and often engaged in extensive outside economic activity. In 1921, Italian fascists attacked existing left-wing autarkic projects at the behest of large landowners, destroying roughly 119 labor chambers, 107 cooperatives and 83 peasant offices that year alone. Nazi Germany under economics minister Hjalmar Schacht, and later Walther Funk, still pursued major international trade, albeit under a different system, to escape the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, satisfy business elites and prepare for war. The regime would continue to conduct trade, including with countries like the United States, including connections with major companies like IBM and Coca-Cola.\nAfter World War II.\nEconomic self-sufficiency was pursued as a goal by some members of the Non-Aligned Movement, such as India under Jawaharlal Nehru and Tanzania, under the ideology of Ujamaa and Swadeshi. That was partly an effort to escape the economic domination of both the United States and the Soviet Union while modernizing the countries' infrastructure.\nIn the case of Francoist Spain, it was both the effect of international sanctions after the Spanish Civil War (1939) and the Second World War and the totalitarian nationalist ideology of Falangism.\nPost-war famine and misery lasted longer than in war-ravaged Europe.\nIt was not until the capitalist reforms of 1950s with the approach to the United States that the Spanish economy recovered the levels of 1935 launching into the Spanish Miracle.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century economists, especially in wealthier countries, backed the emerging Washington consensus, overwhelmingly endorsing free trade while discouraging autarkic and socialist policies. These economists asserted that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growth and economic stability. But economists from many developing nations, or who came from Marxian traditions, endorsed more autarkic ideas including import substitution industrialization and dependency theory. The work of Celso Furtado, Raul Prebisch and Samir Amin, especially Amin's semi-autarkic \"autocentric\" policies, proved influential in efforts by many countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa to stave off economic domination by developing more self-sufficient economies.\nSmall-scale autarkies were sometimes used by the Civil Rights Movement, such as in the case of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Boycotters set up their own self-sufficient system of cheap or free transit to allow black residents to get to work and avoid using the then-segregated public systems in a successful effort to bring political pressure.\nAutarkic efforts for food sovereignty also formed part of the civil rights movement. In the late 60s activist Fannie Lou Hamer was one of the founders of the Freedom Farms Cooperative, an effort to redistribute economic power and build self-sufficiency in Black communities. \"When you've got 400 quarts of greens and gumbo soup canned for the winter, nobody can push you around or tell you what to say or do,\" Hamer summarized as the rationale for the cooperative. The efforts were extensively targeted by segregationist authorities and the far-right with measures ranging from economic pressure to outright violence.\nAfter World War II, Autonomist efforts in Europe embraced local autarkic projects in an effort to craft anti-authoritarian left-wing spaces, especially influencing the social center and squatters' rights movements. Such efforts remain a common feature of Autonomist and anarchist movements on the continent today. The Micropolis social centre in Greece, for example, has gyms, restaurants, bars, meeting space and free distribution of food and resources.\nAround 1970, the Black Panther Party moved away from orthodox communist internationalism towards \"intercommunalism\", a term coined by Huey P. Newton, \"to retain a grasp on the local when the rest of radical thought seemed to be moving global\". Intercommunalism drew from left-wing autarkic projects like free medical clinics and breakfast programs, \"explicitly articulated as attempts to fill a void left by the failure of the federal government to provide resources as basic as food to black communities\".\nIn Murray Bookchin's Communalist ideal, he wrote that in a more liberated future \"every community would approximate local or regional autarky\".\nThe influential 1983 anarchist book \"bolo'bolo\", by Hans Widmer, advocated the use of autarky among its utopian anti-capitalist communes (known as \"bolos\"), asserting \"the power of the State is based on food supply. Only on the basis of a certain degree of autarky can the bolos enter into a network of exchange without being exploited\". Widmer theorized that through \"tactical autarky\" such communes would be able to prevent the return of oppressive structures and a money economy.\nAutarkic efforts to counter the forcible privatization of public resources and maintain local self-sufficiency also formed a key part of alter-globalization efforts. The Cochabamba Water War had Bolivians successfully oppose the privatization of their water system to keep the resource in public hands.\nContemporary.\nToday, national economic autarkies are relatively rare. A commonly-cited example is North Korea, based on the government ideology of Juche (self-reliance), which is concerned with maintaining its domestic localized economy in the face of its isolation. However, even North Korea has extensive trade with Russia, China, Algeria, Syria, Iran, Vietnam, India and many countries in Europe and Africa. North Korea had to import food during a widespread famine in the 1990s.\nSome would consider a modern example at a societal level is Rojava, the autonomous northern region of Syria. Despite a key alliance with the United States, supporters consider them largely cut off from international trade, facing multiple enemies, and striving for a society based on communalism, Rojava's government and constitution emphasize economic self-sufficiency directed by neighborhood and village councils. Rojavan society and economics are influenced by Bookchin's ideas, including the emphasis on local and regional self governance. Under changes made in 2012, property and business belong to those who live in or use it towards these goals, while infrastructure, land and major resources are commons run by local and regional councils. Bookchin, however, was concerned about the effects of isolationist autarky in respect to the closing off of a community, and therefore always stressed the need for a balance between localism and globalism.\nAn example of a contemporary effort at localized autarky, incorporating the concept's history from black nationalism, Ujamaa, African-American socialism and the civil rights movement, is Cooperation Jackson, a movement aimed at creating a self-sufficient black working class economy in Jackson, Mississippi. The movement has aimed to secure land and build self-sufficient cooperatives and workplaces \"to democratically transform the political economy of the city\" and push back against gentrification. Cooperation Jackson also saw a gain in electoral political power when its involvement proved pivotal to the 2013 mayoral election of Chokwe Lumumba and the 2017 election of his son, Chokwe Antar Lumumba.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Imperfect competition causes market inefficiencies, resulting in market failure. Imperfect competition usually describes behaviour of suppliers in a market, such that the level of competition between sellers is below the level of competition in perfectly competitive market conditions.\nThe competitive structure of a market can significantly impact the financial performance and conduct of the firms competing within it. There is a causal relationship between competitive structure, behaviour and performance paradigm. Market structure can be determined by measuring the degree of suppliers' market concentration, which in turn reveals the nature of market competition. The degree of market power refers to firms' ability to affect the price of a good and thus, raise the market price of the good or service above marginal cost (MC).\nThe greater extent to which price is raised above marginal cost, the greater the market inefficiency.\u00a0 Competition in markets ranges from perfect competition to pure monopoly, where monopolies are imperfectly competitive markets with the greatest ability to raise price above marginal cost.\nDemand curves.\nThe imperfect market faces a down-ward sloping demand curve in contrast to a perfectly elastic demand curve in the perfectly competitive market. This is because product differentiation and substitution occurs in the market. It is very easy for a consumer to change their seller which makes the consumer sensitive to price. The Law of demand also plays a very vital role in this market. As price increases, quantity demanded decreases for the given product. The demand curve in perfectly competitive and imperfectly competitive market has been illustrated in the image on the left.\nConditions of perfect competition.\nEconomists primarily use these assumptions of perfect competition for developing economic policy, including economic welfare and efficiency analysis.\nConditions of imperfect competition.\nIf ANY of the above conditions of perfect competition are dissatisfied, the market is imperfectly competitive. Moreover;\nIf ONE of the following conditions are satisfied within an economic market, the market is considered \"imperfect\":\nImportance of imperfect competition.\nImperfect conditions theorists believe that in the aggregate economy no market has ever, or will ever, exhibit the conditions of perfect competition.\nImperfect competition is inherent in capitalist economies. Firms are incentivised by profit, and hence undertake competitive strategies which reap the greatest revenue, by setting P &gt; MC, at the cost of macroeconomic market efficiency. In the most extreme case of a monopoly, producers overcharge for their good or service, and underproduce. Thus, imperfectly competitive pricing strategies impact consumer preferences and purchases, business operation and revenue, and economic policy.\nEconomists are in dispute over whether economic policy should be based on assumptions of perfect competition or imperfect competition. The imperfect theorists' perspective argues that policy based on assumptions of perfect competition is not effective as no market exists in purely perfectly competitive conditions. The argument for assuming perfect competition in economic decision making prevails on the widespread use of its logic, and the present lack of substantial and consistent imperfectly competitive economic models.\nCase study: foreign trade.\nUtilising the assumptions of perfect competition, foreign trade policies advocate for minimal intervention. In a perfectly competitive market, subsidies are harmful, and improvements to terms-of-trade are the first point of call for import protections.\nConversely, imperfect competition assumptions promote intervention in the international trade market. Assuming imperfect competition allows for economic modelling of policies to contain imperfectly competitive firms' market power, or for enhancing monopoly power in situations of national interest.\nThus, assumptions of perfect competition or imperfect competition have implications for policy choices and the efficacy of their effect, domestically and internationally.\nRange of imperfectly competitive market structures.\nThere are FOUR broad market structures that result in imperfect competition. The table below provides an overview of the characteristics of each of these market structures.\nMonopolistic competition.\nA situation in which many firms with slightly different products compete. Moreover, firms compete by selling differentiated products that are highly substitutable, but are not perfect substitutes. Therefore, the level of market power under monopolistic competition is contingent on the degree of product differentiation. Monopolistic competition indicates that enterprises will participate in non-price competition.\nMonopolistic competition is defined to describe two main characteristics of a market:\n1. There are many sellers in the market. Each vendor assumes that a slight change in the price of his product will not affect the overall market price. The belief that competitors will not change their prices just because a vendor in the market changes the price of a product.\n2. The sellers in the market all offer non-homogenous products. Companies have some control over the price of their products. Different types of consumers will buy the goods they like according to their subjective judgment.\nThere are two types of product differentiation:\nEnterprises entering the monopolistic competition market may realize profit increase or loss in the short term, but will realize normal profit in the long run. If the price of the enterprise is high enough to offset the fixed cost above the marginal cost, it will attract the enterprise to enter the market to obtain more profits. Once the enterprise enters the market, it will occupy more market share by lowering the product price until economic profit reaches 0.\nFurthermore, each firm shares a small percentage of the total monopolistic market and hence, has limited control over the prevailing market price. Thus, each firms' demand curve (unlike perfect competition) is downward sloping, rather than flat. The main difference between monopoly competition and perfect competition lies in the paradox of excess capacity and price exceeding marginal cost.\nOligopoly.\nIn an oligopoly market structure, the market is supplied by a small number of firms (more than 2). Moreover, there are so few firms that the actions of one firm can influence the actions of the other firms. Due to the small number of sellers in the market, any adjustment of product quantity and pricing by an enterprise will affect its competitors and thus affect the supply and pricing of the whole market. Oligopolies generally rely on non-price weapons, such as advertising or changes in product characteristics. Several large companies hold large market shares in industrial production, each facing a downward sloping demand, and the industry is often characterized by extensive non-price competition. The oligopoly considers price cuts to be a dangerous strategy. Businesses depend on each other. Under this market structure, the differentiation of products may or may not exist. The product they sell may or may not be differentiated and there are barriers to entry: natural, cost, market size or dissuasive strategies.\nIn an oligopoly, barriers to market entry and exit are high. The major barriers are:\nDuopoly.\nA special type of Oligopoly, where two firms have exclusive power and control in a market. Both companies produce the same type of product and no other company produces the same or alternative product. The goods produced are circulated in only one market, and no other company intends to enter the market. The two companies have a lot of control over market prices. It is a particular case of oligopoly, so it can be said that it is an intermediate situation between monopoly and perfect competition economy. Hence, it is the most basic form of oligopoly.\nMonopoly.\nIn a monopoly market, there is only one supplier and many buyers; it is a firm with no competitors in its industry. If there is competition, it is mainly some marginal companies in the market, generally accounting for 30\u201340% of the market share. The decisions of marginal companies will not materially affect the profits of monopolists. The monopolist has market power, that is, it can influence the price of the good. Moreover, a monopoly is the sole provider of a good or service and thus, faces no competition in the output market. Hence, there are significant barriers to market entry, such as, patents, market size, control of some raw material. Examples of monopolies include public utilities (water, electricity) and Australia Post. \n A monopolist faces a downward sloping demand curve. Thus, as the monopolist raises its price, it sells fewer units. This suggests that when prices rise, even monopolists can drive away customers and sell fewer products. The difference between monopoly and other models is that monopolists can price their products without considering the reactions of other firms' strategic decisions.\nHence, a monopolist's profit maximising quantity is where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. At this point:\nA firm is a monopsonist if it is a single buyer in a market. A natural monopoly occurs when it is cheaper for a single firm to provide all of the market's output.\nGovernments often restrict monopolies through high taxes or anti-monopoly laws as high profits obtained by monopolies may harm the interests of consumers. However, restricting the profits of monopolists may also harm the interests of consumers, because companies may create unsatisfied products that are not available in new markets. These products will bring positive benefits to consumers and create huge economic value for enterprises. Tax and antitrust laws can discourage companies from innovating.\nIntensity of price competition.\nThe intensity of price competition is another good measure of how much control a firm within a market structure has over price. The Herfindahl Index provides a measure of firm concentration within a market and is the sum of the squared market shares of all the firms in the market (Herfindahl Index = (Si)2, where Si = market share of firm i) . Large companies are given more weight in the index (unlike the N-concentration ratio). The value of the index ranges from 1/N to 1 (where \"N\" is the number of firms in the market). Thus, the more concentrated the market is, the larger the value of the Herfindahl Index will be. The table below provides an overview of price competition and intensity in the four main classes of market structure.\nMarket power.\nMarkets that face a downward sloping demand curve are said to have market power. This terms means that the markets have a certain power to decide their own price. This does not mean that the firm can decide the quantity they wish to sell. The firm can decide the price and the quantity is determined by the demand curve. The firm should expect a decrease in quantity demanded if they choose to increase the price. This market power emerges from factors such as:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Political ecology differs from apolitical ecological studies by politicizing environmental issues and phenomena.\nThe academic discipline offers wide-ranging studies integrating ecological social sciences with political economy in topics such as degradation and marginalization, environmental conflict, conservation and control, and environmental identities and social movements.\nOrigins.\nIn international perspective, the origins of political ecology can be traced through different traditions, including an Anglo-American tradition as well as the Latin American and French \"ecolog\u00eda pol\u00edtica\" and \"\u00e9cologie politique\". The English term \"political ecology\" was first coined by Frank Thone in an article published in 1935. It has been widely used since then in the context of human geography and human ecology, but with no systematic definition. Anthropologist Eric R. Wolf gave it a second life in 1972 in an article entitled \"Ownership and Political Ecology\", in which he discusses how local rules of ownership and inheritance \"mediate between the pressures emanating from the larger society and the exigencies of the local ecosystem\", but did not develop the concept further. Other origins include other early works of Eric R. Wolf, Michael J. Watts, Susanna Hecht, and others in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe origins of the field in the 1970s and 1980s were a result of the development of development geography and cultural ecology, particularly the work of Piers Blaikie on the sociopolitical origins of soil erosion. His work revealed common misconceptions of the origins of environmental problems which are often blamed on local people misusing the resources instead of the wider socio-economic and political context.\nHistorically, political ecology has focused on phenomena in and affecting the developing world; since the field's inception, \"research has sought primarily to understand the political dynamics surrounding material and discursive struggles over the environment in the third world\".\nScholars in political ecology are drawn from a variety of academic disciplines, including geography, anthropology, development studies, political science, economics, sociology, forestry, and environmental history.\nOverview.\nWhile the broad scope and interdisciplinary nature of political ecology lends itself to multiple definitions and understandings, common assumptions across the field have given the term relevance. Political ecology is frequently seen as an approach to the study of environmental issues, but it can also be understood to define a lived reality and a praxis for change. Raymond L. Bryant and Sin\u00e9ad Bailey developed three fundamental assumptions in practising political ecology:\nIn addition, political ecology attempts to provide critiques and alternatives in the interplay of the environment and political, economic and social factors. Paul Robbins asserts that the field has a \"normative understanding that there are very likely better, less coercive, less exploitative, and more sustainable ways of doing things\".\nFrom these assumptions, political ecology can be used to:\nScope and influences.\nPolitical ecology's movement as a field since its inception in the 1970s has complicated its scope and goals. Through the discipline's history, certain influences have grown more and less influential in determining the focus of study. Peter A. Walker traces the importance of the ecological sciences in political ecology. He points to the transition, for many critics, from a \u2018structuralist\u2019 approach through the 1970s and 1980s, in which ecology maintains a key position in the discipline, to a 'poststructuralist' approach with an emphasis on the 'politics' in political ecology. This turn has raised questions as to the differentiation with environmental politics as well as the field's use of the term of 'ecology'. Political ecological research has shifted from investigating political influence on the earth's surface to the focus on spatial-ecological influences on politics and power\u2014a scope reminiscent of environmental politics.\nMuch has been drawn from cultural ecology, a form of analysis that showed how culture depends upon, and is influenced by, the material conditions of society (political ecology has largely eclipsed cultural ecology as a form of analysis according to Walker.) As Walker states, \"whereas cultural ecology and systems theory emphasize[s] adaptation and homeostasis, political ecology emphasize[s] the role of political economy as a force of maladaptation and instability\".\nPolitical ecologists often use political economy frameworks to analyze environmental issues. Early and prominent examples of this were \"Silent Violence: Food, Famine and Peasantry in Northern Nigeria\" by Michael Watts in 1983, which traced the famine in northern Nigeria during the 1970s to the effects of colonialism, rather than an inevitable consequence of the drought in the Sahel, and \"The Political Economy of Soil Erosion in Developing Countries\" by Piers Blaikie in 1985, which traced land degradation in Africa to colonial policies of land appropriation, rather than over-exploitation by African farmers.\nRelationship to anthropology and geography.\nOriginating in the 18th and 19th centuries with philosophers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and Thomas Malthus, political economy attempted to explain the relationships between economic production and political processes. It tended toward overly structural explanations, focusing on the role of individual economic relationships in the maintenance of social order. Eric Wolf used political economy in a neo-Marxist framework which began addressing the role of local cultures as a part of the world capitalist system, refusing to see those cultures as \"primitive isolates\". But environmental effects on political and economic processes were under-emphasised.\nConversely, Julian Steward and Roy Rappaport's theories of cultural ecology are sometimes credited with shifting the functionalist-oriented anthropology of the 1950s and 1960s and incorporating ecology and environment into ethnographic study.\nGeographers and anthropologists, working with their respective strengths, formed the basis of political ecology. PE focuses on issues of power, recognizing the importance of explaining environmental impacts on cultural processes without separating out political and economic contexts.\nThe application of political ecology in the work of anthropologists and geographers differs. While any approach will take both the political/economic and the ecological into account, the emphasis can be unequal. Some, such as geographer Michael Watts, focus on how the assertion of power impacts on access to environmental resources. His approach tends to see environmental harm as both a cause and an effect of \u201csocial marginalization\u201d.\nPolitical ecology has strengths and weaknesses. At its core, it contextualizes political and ecological explanations of human behavior. AS Walker points out, though, it has failed to offer \u201ccompelling counter-narratives\u201d to \u201cwidely influential and popular yet deeply flawed and unapologetic neo-Malthusian rants such as Robert Kaplan's (1994) 'The coming anarchy' and Jared Diamond's (2005) \"Collapse\" (385). Ultimately, Walker holds, applying political ecology to policy decisions \u2013 especially in the US and Western Europe \u2013 will prove difficult as long there is resistance to Marxist and neo-Marxist thinking.\nAndrew Vayda and Bradley Walters (1999) criticize political ecologists for presupposing \u201cthe importance ... of certain kinds of political factors in the explanation of environmental changes\u201d (167). Vayda and Walter's response to overly political approaches in political ecology is to encourage what they call \u201cevent ecology\u201d, focusing on human responses to environmental events without presupposing the impact of political processes on environmental events. The critique has not been taken up widely. One example of work that builds on event ecology, in order to add a more explicit focus on the role of power dynamics and the need for including local peoples' voices is Penna-Firme (2013) \"Political and Event Ecology: critiques and opportunities for collaboration\".\nRelationship to conservation.\nThere is a divergence of ideas between conservation science and political ecology. With conservationists establishing protected areas to conserve biodiversity, \"political ecologists have devoted some energy to the study of protected areas, which is unsurprising given political ecology's overall interest in forms of access to, and control over, resources\". Political ecologists argue against the enclosure of land for conservation because it usually denies local people access to the land, harming them and hampering their livelihood systems. As Dove and Carpenter state, \"Indigenous people have important environmental knowledge which could contribute to conservation\". Political ecologists object that it is NGOs and governments who generally impose land use regulations; in effect, this denies Indigenous and other local people the ability themselves to conserve species and areas, rendering such people more vulnerable to dispossession.\nFalse Narratives and Misread Landscapes with Political Ecology..\nWestern societies' views on ecological conservation often overlook Indigenous knowledge and cast the blame for environmental degradation on Indigenous communities. Political ecology scholars exemplify how Indigenous knowledge challenges dominant conservation narratives. Western knowledge tends to overlook Indigenous land-based practices and to undermine their value in maintaining biodiversity. The misinterpretation of these practices can lead to misread landscapes, wherein Indigenous land use practices are framed as destructive through a colonial lens. Fairhead and Leach (1995) address this in their research on West Africa's environmental decline, which they frame as \u201cfalse forest histories\u201d. Their research actively addresses the false narratives projected at Indigenous land-use practices as destructive to local forests. At the same time, evidence shows that Indigenous communities have been active participants in maintaining and caring for the forest. Controlled burning emerges as a key example of misread ecological practices within Fairhead and Leach's (1995) study. Controlled burning was misunderstood as environmentally destructive to local forests and part of irresponsible land use, whereas it had positive ecological effects for the local land. Controlled burning is part of a co-adaptive system in which fire, rain, and soil are seen as interconnected entities that depend on one another to thrive. Therefore, underscores that colonial interpretations of land management tend to take a top-down approach to forest management rather than a holistic, bottom-up approach in environmental conservation. In addition, research in political ecology has analyzed how Indigenous Knowledge (IK) is contested and or excluded within government-led resource management frameworks. This is due to Western science being prioritized over Indigenous epistemologies, leading to IK to become \u201cothered\u201d within the system to benefit the colonial state. On the West Coast of Canada, Indigenous land-use practices, such as the use of cedar, were exploited by colonial forces through the construction of cedar mills . This was due to the toxic air pollution and dust that the cedar mills would create, and therefore affected the Indigenous and non-Indigenous residents and mill workers. Cedar is sacred to the Nuu-chah-nulth-aht people and used within medicinal and spiritual practices. Therefore, the exploitation of this sacred wood was a clear sign of the misunderstanding and an unbalanced relationship between people and nature. Both these incidents demonstrate that IK systems are vital to understanding our ecological environment, and when IK is misunderstood or overlooked, our environment suffers. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In a few cases, perhaps especially tragic local groups have been displaced to create national parks and reserves to \u2018conserve\u2019 the forest. Fortunately, most conservation bodies are now aware that, if a group has been using and managing a forest for several thousand years, throwing it off the land is more apt to destroy the forest ecosystem than to preserve it. (Sutton 2004: 302)\nPower perspective in political ecology.\nPower is at the core of political ecology. According to Greenberg and Park, political ecology is a way of creating a synergy between a political economy that aligns \"power\" distribution with ecological analysis and economic activities in a wider version of bio-environmental relations. Bryant explains political ecology as the dynamic in politics that is associated with \"https://\" and material in the environment of less developed nations, showing how unequal relations in \"power\" make up a political environment. In the view of Robbins, political ecology is a term for empirical explorations that show changes occurring in an environment in clear connection to \"power\".\nGiven the central role of power in political ecology, it is necessary to clarify the field's diverse perspectives on power. \nActor-oriented power perspectives.\nAccording to the actor-oriented power perspectives, power is exercised by actors which are contrary to the presumption of power being perceived as a force likely to pass individuals with no consciousness. Fredrick Engelstad, a Norwegian sociologist explained the concept of power as the combination of https://, causality, and intentionality. The implication of this is that actors are perceived as power carriers in a significant way by which through action a certain intention (intentionality) is achieved, action occurs between at least two actors (relationality), and intended results are produced by action (causality). Viewing the power perspective from the angle of actor-oriented, Dowding submitted that power is linked to the agency, and this does not take away the importance of structure. Rather, while seen actor's use of power as a constraint, it is also propelled by structures.\nThe contributions made by actor-oriented power theory were given by Max Weber in 1964, when he explained power to be people\u2019s ability to the realization of their wills irrespective of the resistance posed by others. An instance given by Robert Dahl is the case where actor A exercises power over actor B by getting actor B to execute a task that actor B will otherwise not do. The extreme case of this is when some group of individuals is mandated to carry out the task contrary to their thought or will.\nSvarstad, Benjaminsen, and Over\u00e5 held that the theory of actor-oriented power help in providing conceptual distinctions with useful insight into the theoretical elements that are vital in studying political ecology. While there are actors who either exercise or try to put power into use in diverse ways, there are also actors who encounter resistance from their oppositions and other forces. An instance of these forces is resisting the fulfilment of actors' intentions by other opposition who are more powerful. It can also come in the form of institutional structural constraints emanating from the outcome of intended actions.\nThe use of power by actors who exercise https:// and actors who resist such interventions is often the emphasis of scholars of political ecology. However, when environmental interventions result in environmental degradations, scholars of political ecology throw their support to actors who resist such exercise of environmental interventions. Actors exercising environmental interventions include corporate organizations, governmental and non-governmental organizations while actors that resist them include groups such as peasants, fishermen, or pastoralists, by exercising counter-power using various kinds of resistance, or active involvement.\nNeo-Marxist power perspectives.\nAmongst the foundations of political ecology is the political economy thought of Marxist which centered on the inequalities that emerged from global capitalism. However, the power perspectives of Marx are most likely highlighted even though there are several perspectives of power in political ecology influenced directly or indirectly by Marx. The Marxist main focus under capitalism is in relation to class and the stability of reproducing this class relation. Marx also placed human agency as the most important of his power concept with the human agency being socially conditioned as seen in his quote below:\n\"\"Men make their history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past (Marx 1852:5)\".\"\nThus, Marx's power theory which formed his perspective of power is the understanding of human agency as being constrained by social structure. As structure produces the potential and extent for power exertion, the human agency is reproducing the structure. This is illustrated by Isaac (1987) using the powerful David Rockefeller (1915 to 2017) as quoted below:\n\"\"But a social theory of power must explain what kinds of social relations exist and how power is distributed by these relations, such that it is possible for David Rockefeller to have the power that he has. To do this is not to deny that it is he who possesses this power, nor to deny those personal attributes determining the particular manner in which he exercises it. It is simply to insist that the power individuals possess has social conditions of existence and that it is these conditions that should be the primary focus of theoretical analysis\".\"\nPoststructuralist power perspectives.\nThe poststructuralist power perspective is the domain of Michel Foucault\u2019s work with its application in political ecology. The poststructuralist power perspectives can be in three dimensions such as; biopower, governmentality, and discursive power.\nBiopower indicates that to secure life, governments are concerned with the improvement of health and quality of life among populations. Foucault in his work explained how through the knowledge of power, people have learned how they should behave. In so doing, Foucault separates sovereign power from bio-power. Where sovereign power is termed \"take life or let live\", the bio-power \"make life or let die\". While human as specie is continuously elaboration in conformity to nature, the superior one will intervene, acting on the environmental condition if the species of human are to be altered. Therefore, bio-power aim in terms of governance and knowledge is to ascertain environmental issues as core concerns.\nPolitical ecology emphasized that understanding how power works in environmental governance follows Foucault\u2019s notion of \u201cgovernmentality\u201d. Foucault sees governmentality as the means employed by the government to make its citizens behave in line with the priorities of government. Fletcher separates governmentality into four kinds. First is \"discipline\" which ensures that the citizens internalize specific manners like ethical standards and social norms. The second is the \"truth\" which is a way of governing citizens using truth-defining standards like religion. The third is \"\" which is a motivational structure formed and used to improve outcomes. The fourth is \"Sovereign power\" used to govern based on rules and punishment for faulting the rules. According to Fletcher, these governmentalities may conflict, work alone, or overlap. Also, the first two are dependent on humans believing government priorities, the second two do not but are seen as of importance.\nLastly, \"discursive power\" manifest when actors (corporate organization, governmental, and non-governmental organizations) make people or groups imbibe and add to the reproduction of the discourses they produce. Unlike in other fields, in political ecology, discourses are studied in line with a critical realist epistemology. There are instances where the formation of discursive power is traced to a state\u2019s colonial era when efforts are made in the appropriation of new territories. Going by the basis of Foucault's political-ecological discursive power, it becomes imperative to mention that, there exist various perspectives to those of Foucault with wider space for human agency.\nComparing between bio-power, governmentality, and discursive power, both governmentality, and discursive power can be regarded as a theoretical perspective with significant importance while bio-power can be regarded as a topical concern identified by Foucault as the core of modern-day governments.\nPolitical ecologists.\nSome prominent contemporary scholars include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRelated journals.\nScholarly journals that have been key to the development (and critique) of this field include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 U.S. census, the population was 271,717. The county seat is Frederick. The county is part of the Capital region of the state.\nLike other outlying sections of the Washington metropolitan area, Frederick County has experienced a rapid population increase since the 1980s. It borders the southern border of Pennsylvania and the northeastern border of Virginia.\nCatoctin Mountain Park in the county is the location of Camp David, a U.S. presidential retreat, and Fort Detrick, a U.S. Army base.\nEtymology.\nThe namesake of Frederick County and its county seat is unknown, but it was probably either Frederick, Prince of Wales, or Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore.\nHistory.\nFrederick County was created in 1748 by the Province of Maryland from parts of Prince George's County and Baltimore County.\nIn 1776, following US independence, Frederick County was divided into three parts. The westernmost portion became Washington County, named after George Washington, the southernmost portion became Montgomery County, named after another Revolutionary War general, Richard Montgomery. The northern portion remained Frederick County.\nIn 1837, a part of Frederick County was combined with a part of Baltimore County to form Carroll County which is east of current day Frederick County.\nThe county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.1%) is water. It is the largest county in Maryland in terms of land area.\nFrederick County straddles the boundary between the Piedmont Plateau Region and the Appalachian Mountains. The county's two prominent ridges, Catoctin Mountain and South Mountain, form an extension of the Blue Ridge. The Middletown Valley lies between them.\nAttractions in the Frederick area include the Clustered Spires, a monument to Francis Scott Key, the National Museum of Civil War Medicine, Monocacy National Battlefield and South Mountain battlefields, and the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum.\nMajor highways.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFrederick County has experienced a rapid increase in population since the 1980s, including that of minority groups.\n2010 census.\nAt the 2010 United States census, there were 233,385\u00a0people, 84,800\u00a0households and 61,198\u00a0families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 90,136 housing units at an average density of . The racial make-up of the county was 81.5% white, 8.6% black or African American, 3.8% Asian, 0.3% American Indian, 2.9% from other races and 2.8% from two or more races. The total (all races) of those self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino origin made up 7.3%, and those persons who were white alone made up 77.8% of the population. 26.3% of the population cited German ancestry, 17.4% Irish, 12.1% English, 7.2% Italian, and 6.3% American.\nOf the 84,800\u00a0households, 37.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.8% were married couples living together, 10.0% had a female householder with no husband present, 27.8% were non-families, and 22.0% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.70 and the average family size was 3.17. The median age was 38.6 years.\nThe median household income was $81,686 and the median family income was $95,036. Males had a median income of $62,494 and females $46,720. The per capita income was $35,172. About 3.2% of families and 4.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.8% of those under age 18 and 5.6% of those age 65 or over.\nLaw, government, and politics.\nCharter government.\nOn December 1, 2014, Frederick County changed to a \"charter home rule government\".\nVoters approved this governmental change at the November 6, 2012, election with 62,469 voting for the transition and 37,368 against. Previously, Frederick County had been governed by a five-member county commission that could only legislate in local matters with the prior consent of the Maryland General Assembly. Even that authority was limited to areas authorized by the General Assembly, enabling legislation, or public local laws. As a charter county, Frederick County is now governed by a seven-member county council, with five elected from districts and two elected at-large. A popularly elected county executive is responsible for providing direction, supervision, and administrative oversight of all executive departments, agencies, and offices. The council has broad power to act on most local matters.\nJan H. Gardner was elected the first Frederick County executive in 2014 and was re-elected in 2018.\nThe members of the third Frederick County Council for the term beginning 2022 are:\nThe Frederick County state's attorney, first elected November 2, 2010, and re-elected in 2018 and 2022, is Charlie Smith, a Republican.\nThe sheriff of Frederick County is Republican Chuck Jenkins.\nFrederick County's fire and rescue service is handled by a combination career and volunteer service delivery system. The county employs over 450 career firefighters. Volunteers of the 26 volunteer fire and rescue corporations number approximately 300 active operational members. Fire, rescue and emergency medical services, including advanced life support, are handled by career staffing supplemented by volunteers. The county has a Maryland State Police Medevac located at the Frederick Municipal Airport and is designated \"Trooper 3\". Trooper 3 handles calls throughout the state, but provides immediate assistance to local police, fire and rescue services.\nPolitics.\nFrederick County was once, like the rest of Appalachian and German-influenced Western Maryland, staunchly Republican, with Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 being the last Democrat to carry it in a presidential election until Joe Biden carried the county in 2020. The growth of the county with migration from Washington D.C. had begun to narrow the margins starting from 2008, with John McCain only edging out Barack Obama by only 1,157 votes out of over one hundred thousand cast in the 2008 election.\nDemocratic strength is mostly concentrated in the city of Frederick, whereas Republican strength is located in the northern rural regions of the county. The county's suburbs, historically Republican-leaning, have become competitive in recent years.\nIn state-level elections, Republicans in Frederick rebounded to more historical levels in the 2010 Maryland gubernatorial and senatorial elections, giving the Republican Ehrlich\u2013Kane ticket 55% to Democrat O'Malley\u2013Brown's 45. Frederick voters also supported Republican Senate challenger Eric Wargotz over incumbent Democratic Senator Barbara Mikulski by a margin of 51\u201346, even as Mikulski was winning statewide by a landslide 61\u201337.\nDespite its conservative reputation, Frederick County voted in favor of Maryland Question 6, which legalized same-sex marriage in Maryland. In the 2014 gubernatorial race, Republican Larry Hogan won Frederick County strongly with 63 percent of the vote compared to Democrat Anthony Brown's 35 percent. In the 2018 elections, despite increased support for Hogan, the Democrats experienced significant gains, securing a majority on the County Council and winning District 3B in the House of Delegates. The Senate election also saw incumbent U.S. Senator Ben Cardin win Frederick County with 51.7% of the vote.\nAfter Biden's win in 2020, the trend towards Democrats continued in 2022, as Democrats increased their majority on the County Council by one seat and gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore won the county with over 53% of the vote compared to 43% for Republican and Emmitsburg resident Dan Cox, the first time Frederick County voted for a Democratic gubernatorial candidate since William Donald Schaefer's landslide victory in 1986. In the Senate election also held in 2022, incumbent Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen won the county 55.3% to 44.6% over Republican Chris Chaffee.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Gubernatorial elections results\nPublic safety.\nThe Frederick County Sheriff's Office provides court protection, jail management and morgue operation for the entire county.

{"id": "45450", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45450", "title": "Wojciech Kilar", "text": "Polish composer (1932\u20132013)\nWojciech Kilar (; 17 July 1932 \u2013 29 December 2013) was a Polish classical and film music composer. One of his greatest successes came with his score to Francis Ford Coppola's \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" in 1992, which received the ASCAP Award and the nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Music. In 2003, he won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film Music written for \"The Pianist\", for which he also received a BAFTA nomination. In 2012, he became the recipient of Poland's highest distinction, the Order of the White Eagle.\nBiography.\nKilar was born on 17 July 1932 in Lw\u00f3w (then Poland; since 1945 Lviv in UkrSSR, now Ukraine). His father was a gynecologist and his mother was a theater actress. Kilar spent most of his life from 1948 in the city of Katowice in Southern Poland, married (from April 1966 to November 2007) to Barbara Pomianowska, a pianist. Kilar was 22 years old when he met 18-year-old Barbara, his future wife.\nEducation.\nAfter studying piano under Maria Bili\u0144ska-Riegerowa and harmony under Artur Malawski, he moved from Krak\u00f3w to Katowice in 1948, where he finished his music middle school in the class of W\u0142adys\u0142awa Markiewicz\u00f3wna, after which he went to the State College of Music (now the Music Academy) in Katowice where he studied piano and composition under Boles\u0142aw Woytowicz, graduating with top honours and the award of a diploma in 1955. He continued his post-graduate studies at the State College of Music (now the Music Academy) in Krak\u00f3w from 1955 to 1958. In 1957 he took part in the International New Music Summer Course in Darmstadt. In 1959\u201360 a French government scholarship enabled him to study composition under Nadia Boulanger in Paris.\nMusic career.\nKilar belonged (together with Boles\u0142aw Szabelski, his student Henryk G\u00f3recki and Krzysztof Penderecki) to the Polish Avant-garde music movement of the Sixties, sometimes referred to as the New Polish School. In 1977 Kilar was one of the founding members of the Karol Szymanowski Society, based in the mountain town of Zakopane. Kilar chaired the Katowice chapter of the Association of Polish Composers for many years and from 1979 to 1981 was vice chair of this association's national board. He was also a member of the Repertoire Committee for the \"Warsaw Autumn\" International Festival of Contemporary Music. In 1991 Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Zanussi made a biographical film about the composer titled \"Wojciech Kilar\".\nHaving received critical success as a classical composer, Kilar scored his first domestic film in 1959, and went on to write music for some of Poland's most acclaimed directors, including Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, Krzysztof Zanussi, Kazimierz Kutz and Andrzej Wajda. He worked on over 100 titles in his home country, including internationally recognised titles such as \"Bilans Kwartalny\" (1975), \"Spirala\" (1978), \"Constans\" (1980), \"Imperativ\" (1982), \"Rok Spokojnego S\u0142o\u0144ca\" (1984), and \"\u017bycie za \u017bycie\" (1991), plus several others in France and across other parts of Europe. He made his English-language debut with Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of \"Dracula\". His other English language features \u2014 Roman Polanski's trio \"Death and the Maiden\" (1994), \"The Ninth Gate\" (1999) and \"The Pianist\" (2002), and Jane Campion's \"The Portrait of a Lady\" (1996) \u2014 were typified by his trademark grinding basses and cellos, deeply romantic themes and minimalist chord progressions.\nIn addition to his film work, Kilar continued to write and publish purely classical works, which have included a horn sonata, a piece for a wind quintet, several pieces for chamber orchestra and choir, the acclaimed Baltic Canticles, the epic \"Exodus\" (famous as the trailer music from \"Schindler's List\" and the main theme of Terrence Malick's \"Knight of Cups\"), a Concerto for Piano and Orchestra dedicated to Peter Jablonski, and his major work, the \"September Symphony\" (2003).\nHaving abandoned Avant-garde music technical means almost entirely, he continued to employ a simplified musical language, in which sizable masses of sound serve as a backdrop for highlighted melodies. This occurs in those compositions that reference folk music (especially Polish Highlander Gorals folk melodies) and in patriotic and religious pieces.\nIllness and death.\nDuring the summer of 2013, Kilar manifested signs of poor health, such as fainting and elevated blood pressure, but attributed those symptoms to his heart problems. However, in September he fell while on the street. He was admitted to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, though news of his illness was only publicly released after his death. He underwent a successful surgery to remove the tumor, which caused no serious side\u2013effects; Kilar was very optimistic and continued to work after the operation. In addition, he underwent radiotherapy for six weeks, a process which left 81-year-old Kilar physically exhausted.\nIn early December 2013, Kilar left the hospital to return to his residence in Katowice. As he did not have any children, he was taken care of by his niece. He was also regularly visited by a Catholic priest and received the Holy Communion twice during the Christmas season. His condition deteriorated on 28 December and on the morning of Sunday, 29 December 2013, Kilar died. Following the cremation of his body, Kilar's funeral was held on 4 January 2014 at the Cathedral of Christ the King in Katowice. After the service, his ashes were laid to rest alongside those of his wife.\nWorks.\nLater in life, Kilar composed symphonic music, chamber works and works for solo instruments. January 2001 saw the world premiere of his \"Missa pro pace\" (composed for a full symphony orchestra, mixed choir and a quartet of soloists) at the National Philharmonic in Warsaw. The work was written to commemorate the Warsaw Philharmonic's centennial. In December 2001, it was performed again in the Paul VI Audience Hall in the presence of Pope John Paul II. His 1984 composition \"Angelus\" was used in the motion picture \"City of Angels\"; \"Orawa\", from 1988, found its use in the Santa Clara Vanguard's 2003 production, \"Pathways\".\nFor most of his life, Kilar's output was dominated by music for film with a small but steady stream of concert works. Post 2000, he turned to \"music of a singular authorship\". Since his 2003 \"September Symphony, (Symphony No.3)\", a four-movement full scale symphony written for the composer's friend Antoni Wit, Kilar returned to absolute music. \"September Symphony\" was the first symphony by the composer since 1955's \"Symphony for Strings\" (along with another student symphony) and Kilar considered it his first mature symphony (composed at age 71).\nFrom 2003, Kilar had been steadily producing large scale concert works. His \"Lament\" (2003) for unaccompanied mixed choir, his Symphony No.4 \"Sinfonia de Motu\" (Symphony of Motion) from 2005 written for large orchestra, choir and soloists, his \"Magnificat\" Mass from 2006, Symphony No.5 \"Advent Symphony\" from 2007 and another large mass, \"Te Deum\" premiered in November 2008. Kilar was quoted as saying that he believed he had discovered the philosopher's stone, and that \"there was nothing more beautiful than the solitary sound or concord that lasted eternally, that this was the deepest wisdom, nothing like our tricks with sonata allegros, fugues, and harmonics.\"\n Kilar's works have been performed by several major international orchestras, including the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic.\nAwards.\nWojciech Kilar received numerous awards for his artistic activity and achievements, including prizes from the Lili Boulanger Foundation in Boston (1960), the Minister of Culture and Art (1967, 1975), the Association of Polish Composers (1975), the Katowice province (1971, 1976, 1980), and the city of Katowice (1975, 1992). He was also awarded the First Class Award of Merit of the Polish Republic (1980), the Alfred Jurzykowski Foundation Prize in New York City (1984), the Solidarity Independent Trade Union Cultural Committee Arts Award (1989), the Wojciech Korfanty Prize (1995), the \"Lux ex Silesia\" Prize bestowed by the Archbishop and Metropolitan of Katowice (1995), and the Sonderpreis des Kulturpreis Schlesien des Landes Niedersachsen (1996).\nKilar's film scores have also won him many honors. He received the best score award for the music to \"Ziemia obiecana\" (\"The Promised Land\") (dir. Andrzej Wajda) at the Festival of Polish Films in Gda\u0144sk in 1975. This was followed by the Prix Louis Delluc, which Kilar was awarded in 1980 for the music to an animated film titled \"Le Roi et l'Oiseau / The King and the Mockingbird\", (dir. Paul Grimault). One year later he collected an award at the Cork International Film Festival for the music to \"Papie\u017c Jan Pawel II / Pope John Paul II / Da un paese lontano: Papa Giovanni Paulo II\" (dir. Krzysztof Zanussi).\nPerhaps his greatest success came with his score to Francis Ford Coppola's \"Dracula\", for which Kilar shared the 1993 ASCAP Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Producers in Los Angeles (along with 7 other people and 5 other movies), and was also nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Music in a science fiction, fantasy, or horror film in San Francisco in 1993.\nIn 2003, he won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Music written for a film, for \"The Pianist\", at France's 28th C\u00e9sar Awards Ceremony in 2003, for which he also received a BAFTA nomination. On this movie's published soundtrack he composed \"Moving to the Ghetto Oct. 31, 1940\" (duration: 1 minute 52 seconds), with the other 10 tracks being works by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin; the music in the actual movie also includes pieces by Beethoven and Bach.\nThe Polish State Cinema Committee honored Kilar with a lifetime achievement award in 1991, while in 1976 he was decorated with the Cavaliers' Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In November 2008 Kilar was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.\nConcert music.\nPiano.\nNumerous solo piano pieces\nSymphonic poems.\nKrzesany.\n is a symphonic poem completed in 1974.\nThe premiere of the poem took place in Warsaw during the \"Warsaw Autumn\" International Festival of Contemporary Music on September 24, 1974. The composer has dedicated a piece to the National Philharmonic. The piece is a reference to the folk music of Podhale. Originally \"Krzesany\" is a folk dance from the Podhale region. The work was completed on July 14, 1974. It was performed for the first time on September 24, 1974. The poem is a one-movement piece. Along with ', \"Hoary Fog\" and ', \"Krzesany\" is a kind of \"Kilarian Tatra polyptych\".\nKo\u015bcielec.\nKo\u015bcielec 1909 is a symphonic poem completed in 1976.\nThe premiere took place in Warsaw on November 5, 1976. Wojciech Kilar composed a piece on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the National Philharmonic in Warsaw and the 100th anniversary of the birth of Mieczys\u0142aw Kar\u0142owicz. The composition was dedicated to the conductor Witold Rowicki. Along with \"Krzesany\", \"Hoary Fog\" and \"Orawa\", \"Ko\u015bcielec 1909\" is a kind of \"Kilarian Tatra polyptych\". The pieces refer to the tradition of Podhale music. The composer distinguished three sections-themes: \"tema della montagna\" (mountain theme), \"tema dell\u2019abisso chiamante\" (abyss theme) and \"tema del destino\" (fate theme). The piece was inspired by the tragic death of the Polish romantic composer Mieczys\u0142aw Kar\u0142owicz. Kar\u0142owicz died on February 8, 1909, in a snow avalanche at the foot of Ma\u0142y Ko\u015bcielec in the Tatra Mountains.\nHoary Fog.\nHoary Fog (Polish title: ) is a vocal-symphonic poem completed in 1979.\nIt was based on the song of the Podhale highlanders. The author dedicated the piece to the opera singer Andrzej Bachleda-Curu\u015b. Along with \"Krzesany\", \"Ko\u015bcielec 1909\" and \"Orawa\", \"Hoary Fog\" is a kind of \"Kilarian Tatra polyptych\". The pieces refer to the tradition of Podhale music. The music is accompanied by the singing of a baritone. The text is a traditional Polish highlander song. It is a one-movement piece. The world premiere took place in Bydgoszcz on October 14, 1979. The baritone part was then performed by Andrzej Bachleda-Curu\u015b, the Symphony Orchestra of the Krak\u00f3w Philharmonic was conducted by Jerzy Katlewicz.\nOrawa.\nOrawa is a symphonic poem for chamber string orchestra completed in 1986.\nThe premiere of the poem took place in Zakopane on March 10, 1986. The Polish Chamber Orchestra was conducted by Wojciech Michniewski. This is the fourth piece by Kilar referring to the tradition of Podhale music. Along with \"Ko\u015bcielec 1909\", \"Hoary Fog\" and \"Krzesany\", \"Orawa\" is a kind of \"Kilarian Tatra polyptych\". There are arrangements for a string quartet, twelve saxophones, an accordion trio, eight cellos and others.\nPolitical views.\nDuring the 2007 election campaign for the National Assembly of the Republic of Poland, Wojciech Kilar made a number of statements of his support of the Law and Justice party.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 91,419. Its county seat is Winchester. The county was formed in 1743 by splitting Orange County. Frederick County is included in the Winchester, VA-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nThe area that would become Frederick County, Virginia, was inhabited and transited by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before European colonization.\nColonization efforts began with the Virginia Company of London, but European settlement did not flourish until after the company lost its charter and Virginia became a royal colony in 1624. In order to stimulate migration to the colony, the headright system was used. Under this system, those who funded an emigrant's transportation costs (not the actual colonizers) were compensated with land. In 1649 the exiled King Charles II granted several acres of colonial Virginia lands to \"seven loyal supporters\", including Lord Fairfax. The Fairfax lands passed to Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1657-1710), who married the daughter of Thomas Colepeper, who also owned several acres of land. After their son, Lord Thomas Fairfax, inherited the combined grants, he controlled over 5,000,000 acres of land in Virginia, including much of the land that became Frederick County.\nFrederick County was created from Orange County in 1738, and was officially organized in 1743. The Virginia Assembly named the new county for Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales (1707\u20131751), the eldest son of King George II of Great Britain. At that time, \"Old Frederick County\" encompassed all or part of four counties in present-day Virginia and five in present-day West Virginia:\nColonial era.\nAs commanding officer of the new Colonial Virginia regiment in 1754, Colonel George Washington located his headquarters in Winchester before and during the French and Indian War. He resigned from military service in 1758. He represented Frederick County in his first elective office, having been elected to the House of Burgesses in 1758 and 1761.\nSeventeen years later, on June 15, 1775, the Continental Congress \"elected\" George Washington as commander-in-chief of the yet-to-be-created Continental Army. He accepted the appointment the next day. This preceded the Congress's declaration of independence and the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.\nAmerican Civil War.\nWinchester was a site of volatile conditions during the Civil War of 1861\u20131865, with control shifting between the Confederate and Union armies on average once every three weeks during the war. Many battles were fought in Frederick County. Some of those battles included:\nThe first constitution of West Virginia provided for Frederick County to be added to the new state if approved by a local election.\nUnlike neighboring Berkeley and Jefferson counties, Frederick County remained in Virginia; as it was occupied by the Confederate army, no vote was permitted to ascertain the residents' wishes.\nCivilian history of the area.\nFour (alkaline, saline, chalybeate, and sulphured) types of mineral water springs naturally occur on the land that would later be named Rock Enon Springs. The area was once called Capper Springs, named for area settler John Capper. William Marker bought the in 1856 and built a hotel, the first building of the Rock Enon Springs Resort. It survived the American Civil War. On March 24, 1899, the Shenandoah Valley National Bank purchased the property for $3,500. During the summer of 1914 botanists found a variety of ferns on the property: \"polypodium vulgare,\" \"phegopteris hexagonoptera,\" \"adiantum pedatum,\" \"pteris aquilina,\" and \"cheilanthes lanosa.\"\nThe idea that soaking in the natural spring water had medical value made this and other springs popular tourist destinations through the early 20th century.\nIn 1944, people no longer had as much faith in the springs, and there was much more competition for tourists at other sites. Due to declining business, the Glaize family sold the property to the Shenandoah Area Council. They adapted the resort to operate as a Boy Scout site, Camp Rock Enon. In 1944 the Miller Lake was created by adding a earth dam across Laurel Run using equipment, owned by the Federal fish hatchery in Leestown. In 1958 \"walnut, chestnut and persimmon trees\" were planted on the property.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water. This is the northernmost county in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 Census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 59,209 people, 22,097 households, and 16,727 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 23,319 housing units at an average density of .

The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 3.02.\nIn the county, the population was spread out, with 26.40% under the age of 18, 7.00% from 18 to 24, 31.90% from 25 to 44, 24.10% from 45 to 64, and 10.60% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.10 males. For every 100 females aged 18 and over, there were 96.70 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $46,941, and the median income for a family was $52,281. Males had a median income of $35,705 versus $25,046 for females. The per capita income for the county was $21,080. About 4.00% of families and 6.40% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.30% of those under age 18 and 6.90% of those age 65 or over.\nGovernment.\nConstitutional officers.\nFrederick is represented by Republican Timmy French (R), in the Virginia Senate, Bill Wiley (R), and Delores Riley Oates (R), in the Virginia House of Delegates, and Ben Cline (R) in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nTransportation.\nMajor highways.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEducation.\nFrederick County is served by Frederick County Public Schools, which includes several elementary, middle, and high schools. Frederick County is also part of the region served by the Mountain Vista Governor's School, which offers upper-level classes to intellectually gifted high school students.\nCommunities.\nAlthough designated as the county seat, Winchester, like all cities under Virginia law, is an independent city, politically independent of any county.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 U.S. census, the population was 967,201, making it the second-most populous county in Maryland, behind neighboring Montgomery County. The 2020 census counted an increase of nearly 104,000 in the previous ten years. Its county seat is Upper Marlboro. It is the most populous African American-majority county in the United States, as well as the second most affluent behind neighboring Charles County.\nThe county is part of the Capital region of the state, though portions of the county are considered to be in Southern Maryland. The county also hosts many federal governmental facilities, such as Joint Base Andrews and the United States Census Bureau headquarters.\nEtymology.\nThe official name of the county, as specified in the county's charter, is \"Prince George's County, Maryland\". The county is named after Prince George of Denmark (1653\u20131708), the consort of Anne, Queen of Great Britain, and the brother of King Christian V of Denmark and Norway. The county's demonym is Prince Georgian, and its motto is \"Semper Eadem\" (), a phrase used by Queen Anne. Prince George's County is frequently referred to as \"PG\" or \"PG County\", an abbreviation which is the subject of debate, some residents viewing it as a pejorative and others holding neutral feelings toward the term or even preferring the abbreviation over the full name.\nHistory.\nThe Cretaceous Era brought dinosaurs to the area that left fossils now preserved in a park in Laurel. The site, which among other finds has yielded fossilized teeth from \"Astrodon\" and \"Priconodon\" species, has been called the most prolific in the eastern United States.\nIn the mid to late Holocene era, the area was occupied by Paleo-Native Americans and then, later, Native Americans. When the first European settlers arrived, what is now Prince George's County was inhabited by people of the Piscataway Indian Nation. Three branches of the tribe are still living today, two of which are headquartered in Prince George's County.\n17th century.\nPrince George's County was created by the English Council of Maryland in the Province of Maryland in April 1696 from portions of Charles and Calvert counties. The county was divided into six districts referred to as \"Hundreds\": Mattapany, Petuxant, Collington, Mount Calvert, Piscattoway and New Scotland.\n18th century.\nA portion was detached in 1748 to form Frederick County. Because Frederick County was subsequently divided to form the present Allegany, Garrett, Montgomery, and Washington counties, all of these counties in addition were derived from what had up to 1748 been Prince George's County.\nIn 1791, portions of Prince George's County were ceded to form the new District of Columbia (along with portions of Montgomery County, Maryland and parts of Northern Virginia that were later returned to Virginia).\n19th century.\nDuring the War of 1812, the British marched through the county by way of Bladensburg to burn the White House. On their return, they kidnapped a prominent doctor, William Beanes. Lawyer Francis Scott Key was asked to negotiate for his release, which resulted in his writing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".\nPrince George's County had the highest population of enslaved Africans within the state of Maryland. These people carried out forced labor on tobacco farms and plantations throughout Prince George's County.\nDuring the Civil War, hundreds of enslaved black men in Prince George's County were given freedom in exchange for joining the Union Army and fighting in Colored units against Confederate forces. When Abraham Lincoln ordered the end of slavery in America, he did not free the slaves in Maryland because he was concerned that slave-owning Maryland would revolt, leaving Washington D.C. surrounded by Confederate forces. However John Pendleton Kennedy, a Maryland politician who became an abolitionist after watching a speech by Frederick Douglass, led a referendum campaign to end slavery in the state. In 1864, the citizens of Maryland voted to end slavery. However the state was so divided that the referendum won by only 1,000 votes. Lincoln then ordered the Union Army to enforce the ban in Maryland and all enslaved people in the state were freed.\nAfter the Civil War, many African Americans attempted to become part of Maryland politics, but were met with violent repression after the fall of Reconstruction.\nIn April 1865, John Wilkes Booth made his escape through Prince George's County while en route to Virginia after killing President Abraham Lincoln.\n20th century.\nThe proportion of African Americans declined during the first half of the 20th century, but was renewed to over 50% in the early 1990s when the county again became majority African American. The first African American County Executive was Wayne K. Curry, elected in 1994.\nOn July 1, 1997, the Prince George's County section of the city of Takoma Park, which straddled the boundary between Prince George's and Montgomery counties, was transferred to Montgomery County. This was done after city residents voted in a referendum to be under the sole jurisdiction of Montgomery County, and subsequent approval by both counties and the Maryland General Assembly. This was the first change in Montgomery/Prince George's County line boundaries since 1968, when the City of Laurel was unified in Prince George's County; additional legislation was proposed in 1990 for a technical correction, though may not have achieved enactment.\n21st century.\nThe county's population nearly reached one million residents in the 2020 census. It was the largest and highest-income black-majority county in the United States until the 2020 census, when it was surpassed by Charles County. Hispanic residents grew in number to 21% of the total population.\nThe county experienced a dramatic drop in crime, including record drops in violent crime, although in 2021 and 2022, violent crime increased by 30%. From 2020 to mid-2022 over 2,200 residents died of COVID-19, over 19,000 county residents were left with long-term post-COVID symptoms\nand over 193,000 COVID infections had been recorded.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.2%) is water.\nPrince George's County lies in the Atlantic coastal plain, and its landscape is characterized by gently rolling hills and valleys. Along its western border with Montgomery County, Adelphi, Calverton and West Laurel rise into the piedmont, exceeding in elevation.\nThe Patuxent River forms the county's eastern border with Howard, Anne Arundel, Charles and Calvert counties.\nRegions.\nTerrain, culture, and demographics differ significantly by location within the county. There are five key regions to Prince George's County: North County, Central County, the Rural Tier, the Inner Beltway, and South County. These regions are not formally defined, however, and the terms used to describe each area can vary greatly. In the broadest terms, the county is generally divided into North County and South County with U.S. Route 50 serving as the dividing line.\nSouthern Prince George's County is also considered to be a part of the Southern Maryland region.\nNorth County.\nNorthern Prince George's County includes Laurel, Beltsville, Adelphi, College Park and Greenbelt. This area of the county is anchored by the Capital Beltway and the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway. Hyattsville developed early in the 20th century due to its proximity to rail transportation and U.S. Highway 1. Laurel is experiencing a population boom with the construction of the Inter-County Connector. The key employers in this region are the University of Maryland, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, and NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center. Areas of geographic distinction include Greenbelt Park, a wooded reserve adjacent to the planned environmental community of Greenbelt, and University Park, a collection of historic homes adjacent to the University of Maryland. Riversdale Mansion, along with the historic homes of Berwyn Heights, Mt. Rainier and Hyattsville, along with Langley Park are also located in this area. Lake Artemesia and the surrounding park were constructed during the completion of the Washington Metro Green Line, and it incorporates a stocked fishing lake and serves as the trail-head for an extensive Anacostia Tributary Trails system that runs along the Anacostia River and its tributaries. The south and central tracts of the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center also lie in this part of the county; the north tract lies north of the Patuxent River in Anne Arundel County.\nCentral County.\nCentral County, located on the eastern outskirts of the Capital Beltway, consists of Mitchellville, Woodmore, Greater Upper Marlboro, Springdale, Largo, and Bowie. According to the 2010 census, it has generally been the fastest growing region of the county. Mitchellville is named for a wealthy family, the Mitchells, who owned a large portion of land in this area of the county. Central Avenue, a major exit off the I-95 beltway, running east to west, is one of two main roads in this portion of the county. The other major roadway is Old Crain Highway, which runs north to south along the eastern portion of the county. The Newton White Mansion on the grounds is a popular site for weddings and political events. Joint Base Andrews, Bowie State University and Prince George's Community College are in the Central region, as well as County government offices.\nInner Beltway.\nThe inner beltway communities of Capitol Heights, District Heights, Fairmont Heights, Forestville, Suitland, Hillcrest Heights, Oxon Hill, and Seat Pleasant border neighboring District of Columbia's northeastern and southeastern quadrants. The area has easy access to Metro's Blue, Silver or Green Lines, commercial centers, Maryland Route 214, and Interstate 95/Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway). Protected bike trails connect residents to the Bladensburg waterfront, Kenilworth parks, and downtown D.C. Fairmont Heights is the second oldest African-American-majority municipality in Prince George's County. The Fairmount Heights Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.\nBowie is best known as a planned Levittown. William Levitt in the 1960s built traditional homes, as well as California contemporaries along U.S. Route 50, the key highway to the eastern shore and the state capital of Annapolis. Bowie has currently grown to be the largest city in Prince George's County, with more than 50,000 people. It also has a large Caucasian population, compared to much of the county (48% of the population). Housing styles vary from the most contemporary to century-old homes in Bowie's antique district (formerly known as Huntingtown), where the town of Bowie began as a haven for thoroughbred horse racing. Areas of geographic distinction include the Oden Bowie Mansion, Allen Pond, key segments of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Trail, as well as planned parks, lakes and walking trails.\nRural Tier.\nPrince George's rural tier was designated \"in the 2002 General Plan as an area where residential growth would be minimal\"; it may be found in the area just beyond the Beltway to the west and south of central county, though with direct access by Route 210, while bounded on the west by the communities Accokeek and Fort Washington, and the east by the Patuxent River. Prince George's origins are in this part of the county. Most of this area contains the unincorporated parishes, villages and lost towns of Prince George's County. Largely under postal designations of \"Upper Marlboro\" or \"Brandywine\", in truth the town of Upper Marlboro is more central county in character, though it is the post office location for various rural settlements. (The names of these unincorporated areas are listed below in the towns section of this article). Since 1721 Upper Marlboro has been the county seat of government, with families that trace their lineage back to Prince George's initial land grants and earliest governing officials. Names like Clagett, Sasscer, King James and Queen Anne pepper the streets.\nThe rural tier has been the focus of orchestrated efforts by residents and county government to preserve its rural character and environmental integrity. Under the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC), Patuxent River Park is the largest natural preserve and provides public access for birdwatching and viewing the rural tier's natural waterfront vistas. In season, the park's Jug Bay Natural Area and the Patuxent Riverkeeper in Queen Anne both offer canoeing and kayaking rentals on the Patuxent. The county's largest collection of tobacco planter mansions and preserved homes are in the rural tier, some managed by the M-NCPPC. Many rural tier roads have scenic highway preservation status. Rosaryville State Park is in the county, not far from the county seat.\nSouth County.\nSouth County is a blend of the greenery of the rural tier and the new development of central county. The communities of Clinton, Oxon Hill, Temple Hills including Hillcrest Heights, and Fort Washington are the largest areas of south county. It is the only portion of Prince George's County to enjoy the Potomac River waterfront, and that geographic distinction has yielded the rise of the National Harbor project: a town center and riverside shopping and living development on the Potomac. The National Harbor, and its associated entertainment (MGM National Harbor) and shopping (Tanger Outlets) districts, have become a major tourist and convention attraction, with significant hotel accommodations, eateries and shopping. Together, these projects were built on land formerly occupied by the Salubria plantation, where a 14-year-old slave girl poisoned her owner, John H. Bayne, and his family in 1831. Water taxi service connects National Harbor to other destinations along the Potomac. Several historic sites, including Jones Point Lighthouse, can be viewed from the harbor front. Piscataway Park in Accokeek preserves many acres of woodland and wetlands along the Potomac River opposite Mount Vernon, Virginia. River Road in Fort Washington also yields great views of the Potomac. Fort Washington Park was a major battery and gives access to the public for tours of the fort, scenic access to the river and other picnic grounds. Oxon Hill Manor offers a working farm and plantation mansion for touring; His Lordship's Kindness is another major historic home. Also, Fort Foote is an old American Civil War fort and tourist destination.\nAdjacent counties and independent cities.\nPrince George's and Montgomery Counties share a bi-county planning and parks agency in the M-NCPPC and a public bi-county water and sewer utility in the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission\nPolitics and government.\nSince 1792, the county seat has been Upper Marlboro. Prior to 1792, the county seat was located at Mount Calvert, a 76-acre (308,000 m2) estate along the Patuxent River on the edge of what is now in the unincorporated community of Croom. Since 1991, the county has slowly moved government functions from rural Upper Marlboro to the Largo area, closer to the center of population, while proposals to move the actual county seat remain controversial.\nPrince George's County was granted a charter form of government in 1970 with the county executive elected as the head of the executive branch and the county council members as the leadership of the legislative branch. The county is divided into nine councilmanic districts, whose number designations wind roughly from north to south. Two at-large council seats were added in 2018. Prince George's County is part of the Seventh Judicial Circuit of the state of Maryland and holds 23 of the 32 total circuit court judges in the circuit (which includes Calvert, Charles, Prince George's, and St. Mary's counties).\nFitch Ratings assigned a 'AAA' bond rating to Prince George's County on August 25, 2011, re-affirming the county's stable financial outlook. Earlier in 2011, the county received 'AAA' status from Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's. 'AAA' bond ratings are the highest possible bond ratings a jurisdiction can receive.\nAs part of the increasingly liberal D.C. suburbs and a nationwide suburban shift towards the Democrats, Prince George's County is a Democratic stronghold, having voted majority-Democratic in every presidential election but four since 1932: Dwight D. Eisenhower's landslide elections in 1952 and 1956, and Richard Nixon's two candidacies in 1968 and 1972. It has not given over 15% of the vote to the Republican nominee since 2004, and was Joe Biden's second strongest county in the country (and third-best county equivalent after Washington, D.C.) in the 2020 presidential election, only behind Kalawao County, Hawaii, awarding him 89.26% of the vote, and Kamala Harris\u2019s strongest county (again, after Washington DC) in the 2024 presidential election, awarding her 85.9% of the vote. \nVoter registration.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEmergency services.\nLaw enforcement.\nPrince George's County is serviced by multiple law enforcement agencies. The Prince George's County Police Department is the primary police service for county residents residing in unincorporated areas of the county. In addition, the Prince George's County Sheriff's Office acts as the enforcement arm of the county court, and also shares some patrol responsibility with the county police. County parks are serviced by the Prince George's County Division of the Maryland-National Capital Park Police.\nBesides the county-level services, all but one of the 27 local municipalities maintain police departments that share jurisdiction with the county police services. Furthermore, the Maryland State Police enforces the law on state highways which pass through the county with the exception of Maryland Route 200 where the Maryland Transportation Authority Police is the primary law enforcement agency and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police patrol the state parks and navigable waterways located within the county.\nAlong with the state and local law enforcement agencies, the federal government also maintains several departments that service citizens of the county such as the US Park Police, US Postal Police, the 316th Security Forces Squadron (specifically covering Andrews AFB), and other federal police located on various federal property within the county.\nIn addition, nearly all of the incorporated cities and towns in the county have their own municipal police force. Notable exceptions include the city of College Park.\nOther emergency services.\nPrince George's County hospitals include Bowie Health Center, Doctors Community Hospital in Lanham, Gladys Spellman Specialty Hospital &amp; Nursing Center in Cheverly, Laurel Regional Hospital in Laurel, Southern Maryland Hospital Center in Clinton, University of Maryland Capital Region Medical Center, a state-of-the-art acute care teaching hospital, and Fort Washington Medical Center. Hospice of the Chesapeake has offices in Largo, with a staff that serves patients in their homes, including skilled nursing, senior living and assisted living facilities.\nThe Prince George's County Volunteer Firemen's Association was formed in 1922 with several of the first companies organized in the county. The first members of the association were Hyattsville, Cottage City, Mount Rainier, and Brentwood.\nIn March 1966, the Prince George's County Government employed the firefighters who had been hired by individual volunteer stations and an organized career department was begun. The career firefighters and paramedics are represented by IAFF 1619. Prince George's County Fire/Rescue Operations consists of 45 Fire/EMS stations.\nPrince George's County became the first jurisdiction in Maryland to implement the 9-1-1 Emergency Reporting System in 1973. Advanced life support services began for citizens of the county in 1977. Firefighters were certified as Cardiac Rescue Technicians and deployed in what was called at the time Mobile Intensive Care Units to fire stations in Brentwood, Silver Hill, and Laurel.\nAs of 2007, the Prince George's County Fire/EMS Department operates a combination system staffed by over 800 career firefighters and paramedics, and nearly 1,100 active volunteers.\nCounty law has, for years, required &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Animal Control to seize all pit bulls from their owners if they become aware of them. This is controversial and Animal Control itself objects to this law. It has routinely required them to act when they see such a dog behaving peacefully inside of a private home merely because Animal Control is checking something unrelated.\nState representation.\nThe Prince George's County Delegation represents the county via 23 delegates in the Maryland House of Delegates. Eight senators represent the county in the Maryland State Senate.\nHouse of Delegates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFederal representation.\nIn the 118th Congress, most of Prince George's County is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Glenn Ivey (D) of the 4th district and Steny Hoyer (D) of the 5th district. A small part of the northwestern portion of the county is represented by Jamie Raskin (D) of the 8th district.\nTransportation.\nThe County contains a 28-mile portion of the 65-mile-long Capital Beltway. After a decades-long debate, an east\u2013west toll freeway, the Intercounty Connector (\"ICC\"), which extends Interstate 370 in Montgomery County to connect I-270 with Interstate 95 and U.S. 1 in Laurel, opened in 2012. An 11.5-mile portion of the 32.5-mile-long Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway runs from the county's border with Washington, D.C., to its border with Anne Arundel County near Laurel.\nThe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority operates Metrobus fixed-route bus service and Metrorail heavy-rail passenger service in and out of the county as well as the regional MetroAccess paratransit system for the handicapped. The Prince George's County Department of Public Works and Transportation also operates TheBus, a County-wide fixed-route bus system, and the Call-A-Bus service for passengers who do not have access to or have difficulty using fixed-route bus service. Call-A-Bus is a demand-response service which generally requires 14-days advance reservations. The county also offers a subsidized taxicab service for elderly and disabled residents called Call-A-Cab in which eligible customers who sign up for the service purchase coupons giving them a 50 percent discount with participating taxicab companies in Prince George's and Montgomery Counties.\nMass transit.\nPrince George's County Metro Rail.\nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has fifteen stations of the Washington Metro system located in Prince George's County, with four of them as terminus stations: , , Largo, and . The Purple Line, which would link highly developed areas of both Montgomery and Prince George's Counties is currently under-construction and slated to open in 2027. The Purple Line will provide connections to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's Red Line via Northern Prince George's County and Montgomery County. The Orange Line and MARC Train's Penn Line will have transfer points at New Carrollton station.\nPrince George's County Commuter Rail.\nThe MARC Train (Maryland Area Rail Commuter) train service has two lines that traverse Prince George's County. The Camden Line, which runs between Baltimore Camden Station and Washington Union Station and has six stops in the county at Riverdale, College Park, Greenbelt, Muirkirk, Laurel and Laurel Race Track. The Penn Line runs on the Amtrak route between Pennsylvania and Washington Union stations. It has three stops in the county: Bowie State, Seabrook and New Carrollton.\nAirports.\nThe College Park Airport (CGS), established in 1909, is the world's oldest continuously operated airport and is home to the adjacent College Park Aviation Museum.\nPrivately owned general aviation airfields in the county include Freeway Airport (W00) in Mitchellville, Potomac Airfield (VKX) in Friendly, and private heliports.\nThe area is served by three airports: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Arlington County, Virginia, Baltimore\u2013Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) in neighboring Anne Arundel County, and Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Dulles, Virginia.\nAndrews Air Force Base (ADW), the airfield portion of Joint Base Andrews, is also near Camp Springs.\nWater taxi.\nPrince George's County is served by a water taxi that operates from the National Harbor to Alexandria, Virginia and to The Wharf in Washington, D.C.\nFuture transit.\nBecause of its location north and east of Washington, D.C., several future transit technology projects look to be routed partially through Prince George's County. The first stage of The Boring Company's proposed Washington-to-New York hyperloop will travel beneath the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway through Prince George's en route to Baltimore. No hyperloop stops within the county are projected. Similarly, former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has supported efforts to trial a 40-mile superconducting maglev (SCMaglev) train route connecting Washington to Baltimore. Proposed routes would run through Prince George's parallel to the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway or along the Amtrak Penn Line corridor. As with the hyperloop, no SCMaglev stop is planned within Prince George's County. The Purple Line light transit rail is currently in construction in College Park and New Carrollton.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nThe Hispanic population continues to grow in the county with several cities and CDPs reaching a Latino majority (Adelphi, Brentwood, Chillum, Colmar Manor, East Riverdale, Langley Park, Landover Hills, Woodlawn).\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 863,420\u00a0people, 304,042\u00a0households, and 203,520\u00a0families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 328,182 housing units at an average density of . The racial and ancestral makeup of the county was: \nThose of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 14.9% of the population, an equal percentage to Whites of indeterminate origin.

{"id": "45456", "revid": "329764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45456", "title": "Crossbar switch", "text": "Collection of electronic switches arranged in a matrix\nIn electronics and telecommunications, a crossbar switch (cross-point switch, matrix switch) is a collection of switches arranged in a matrix configuration. A crossbar switch has multiple input and output lines that form a crossed pattern of interconnecting lines between which a connection may be established by closing a switch located at each intersection, the elements of the matrix. Originally, a crossbar switch consisted literally of crossing metal bars that provided the input and output paths. Later implementations achieved the same switching topology in solid-state electronics. The crossbar switch is one of the principal telephone exchange architectures, together with a rotary switch, memory switch, and a crossover switch.\nGeneral properties.\nA crossbar switch is an assembly of individual switches between a set of inputs and a set of outputs. The switches are arranged in a matrix. If the crossbar switch has M inputs and N outputs, then a crossbar has a matrix with \"M\" \u00d7 \"N\" cross-points or places where connections can be made. At each crosspoint is a switch; when closed, it connects one of the inputs to one of the outputs. A given crossbar is a single layer, non-blocking switch. A crossbar switching system is also called a coordinate switching system.\nCollections of crossbars can be used to implement multiple layer and blocking switches. A blocking switch prevents connecting more than one input. A non-blocking switch allows other concurrent connections from inputs to other outputs.\nApplications.\nCrossbar switches are commonly used in information processing applications such as telephony and circuit switching, but they are also used in applications such as mechanical sorting machines.\nThe matrix layout of a crossbar switch is also used in some semiconductor memory devices which enables the data transmission. Here the bars are extremely thin metal wires, and the switches are fusible links. The fuses are blown or opened using high voltage and read using low voltage. Such devices are called programmable read-only memory. At the 2008 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference a paper was presented that discussed a nanoscale crossbar implementation of an adding circuit used as an alternative to logic gates for computation.\nMatrix arrays are fundamental to modern flat-panel displays. Thin-film-transistor LCDs have a transistor at each crosspoint, so they could be considered to include a crossbar switch as part of their structure.\nFor video switching in home and professional theater applications, a crossbar switch (or a matrix switch, as it is more commonly called in this application) is used to distribute the output of multiple video appliances simultaneously to every monitor or every room throughout a building. In a typical installation, all the video sources are located on an equipment rack, and are connected as inputs to the matrix switch.\nWhere central control of the matrix is practical, a typical rack-mount matrix switch offers front-panel buttons to allow manual connection of inputs to outputs. An example of such a usage might be a sports bar, where numerous programs are displayed simultaneously. Ordinarily, a sports bar would install a separate desk top box for each display for which independent control is desired. The matrix switch enables the operator to route signals at will, so that only enough set top boxes are needed to cover the total number of unique programs to be viewed, while making it easier to control sound from any program in the overall sound system.\nSuch switches are used in high-end home theater applications. Video sources typically shared include set-top receivers or DVD changers; the same concept applies to audio. The outputs are wired to televisions in individual rooms. The matrix switch is controlled via an Ethernet or RS-232 connection by a whole-house automation controller, such as those made by AMX, Crestron, or Control4, which provides the user interface that enables the user in each room to select which appliance to watch. The actual user interface varies by system brand, and might include a combination of on-screen menus, touch-screens, and handheld remote controls. The system is necessary to enable the user to select the program they wish to watch from the same room they will watch it from, otherwise it would be necessary for them to walk to the equipment rack.\nThe special crossbar switches used in distributing satellite TV signals are called multiswitches.\nImplementations.\nHistorically, a crossbar switch consisted of metal bars associated with each input and output, together with some means of controlling movable contacts at each cross-point. The first switches used metal pins or plugs to bridge a vertical and horizontal bar. In the later part of the 20th century, the use of mechanical crossbar switches declined and the term described any rectangular array of switches in general. Modern crossbar switches are usually implemented with semiconductor technology. An important emerging class of optical crossbars is implemented with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology.\nMechanical.\nA type of mid-20th-century telegraph exchange consisted of a grid of vertical and horizontal brass bars with a hole at each intersection (\"cf.\" top picture). The operator inserted a metal pin to connect one telegraph line to another.\nElectromechanical switching in telephony.\nA telephony crossbar switch is an electromechanical device for switching telephone calls. The first design of what is now called a crossbar switch was the Bell company Western Electric's coordinate selector of 1915. To save money on control systems, this system was organized on the stepping switch or selector principle rather than the link principle. It was little used in America, but the Televerket Swedish governmental agency manufactured its own design (the Gotthilf Betulander design from 1919, inspired by the Western Electric system), and used it in Sweden from 1926 until the digitization in the 1980s in small and medium-sized A204 model switches. The system design used in AT&amp;T Corporation's 1XB crossbar exchanges, which entered revenue service from 1938, developed by Bell Telephone Labs, was inspired by the Swedish design but was based on the rediscovered link principle. In 1945, a similar design by Swedish Televerket was installed in Sweden, making it possible to increase the capacity of the A204 model switch. Delayed by the Second World War, several millions of urban 1XB lines were installed from the 1950s in the United States.\nIn 1950, the Swedish Ericsson company developed their own versions of the 1XB and A204 systems for the international market. In the early 1960s, the company's sales of crossbar switches exceeded those of their rotating 500-switching system, as measured in the number of lines. Crossbar switching quickly spread to the rest of the world, replacing most earlier designs like the Strowger (step-by-step) and Panel systems in larger installations in the U.S. Graduating from entirely electromechanical control on introduction, they were gradually elaborated to have full electronic control and a variety of calling features including short-code and speed-dialing. In the UK the Plessey Company produced a range of TXK crossbar exchanges, but their widespread rollout by the British Post Office began later than in other countries, and then was inhibited by the parallel development of TXE reed relay and electronic exchange systems, so they never achieved a large number of customer connections although they did find some success as tandem switch exchanges.\nCrossbar switches use switching matrices made from a two-dimensional array of contacts arranged in an x\u2013y format. These switching matrices are operated by a series of horizontal bars arranged over the contacts. Each such select bar can be rocked up or down by electromagnets to provide access to two levels of the matrix. A second set of vertical hold bars is set at right angles to the first (hence the name, \"crossbar\") and also operated by electromagnets. The select bars carry spring-loaded wire fingers that enable the hold bars to operate the contacts beneath the bars. When the select and then the hold electromagnets operate in sequence to move the bars, they trap one of the spring fingers to close the contacts beneath the point where two bars cross. This then makes the connection through the switch as part of setting up a calling path through the exchange. Once connected, the select magnet is then released so it can use its other fingers for other connections, while the hold magnet remains energized for the duration of the call to maintain the connection. The crossbar switching interface was referred to as the TXK or TXC (telephone exchange crossbar) switch in the UK.\nHowever, the Bell System \"Type B\" crossbar switch of the 1960s was made in the largest quantity. The majority were 200-point switches, with twenty verticals and ten levels of three wires. Each select bar carries ten fingers so that any of the ten circuits assigned to the ten verticals can connect to either of two levels. Five select bars, each able to rotate up or down, mean a choice of ten links to the next stage of switching. Each crosspoint in this particular model connected six wires. The vertical off-normal contacts next to the hold magnets are lined up along the bottom of the switch. They perform logic and memory functions, and the hold bar keeps them in the active position as long as the connection is up. The horizontal off-normals on the sides of the switch are activated by the horizontal bars when the butterfly magnets rotate them. This only happens while the connection is being set up, since the butterflies are only energized then.\nThe majority of Bell System switches were made to connect three wires including the tip and ring of a balanced pair circuit and a sleeve lead for control. Many connected six wires, either for two distinct circuits or for a four wire circuit or other complex connection. The Bell System \"Type C\" miniature crossbar of the 1970s was similar, but the fingers projected forward from the back and the select bars held paddles to move them. The majority of type C had twelve levels; these were the less common ten level ones. The Northern Electric \"Minibar\" used in SP1 switch was similar but even smaller. The ITT Pentaconta Multiswitch of the same era had usually 22 verticals, 26 levels, and six to twelve wires. Ericsson crossbar switches sometimes had only five verticals.\nInstrumentation.\nFor instrumentation use, James Cunningham, Son and Company made high-speed, very-long-life crossbar switches with physically small mechanical parts which permitted faster operation than telephone-type crossbar switches. Many of their switches had the mechanical Boolean AND function of telephony crossbar switches, but other models had individual relays (one coil per crosspoint) in matrix arrays, connecting the relay contacts to [x] and [y] buses. These latter types were equivalent to separate relays; there was no logical AND function built in. Cunningham crossbar switches had precious-metal contacts capable of handling millivolt signals.\nTelephone exchange.\nEarly crossbar exchanges were divided into an originating side and a terminating side, while the later and prominent Canadian and US SP1 switch and 5XB switch were not. When a user picked up the telephone handset, the resulting line loop operating the user's line relay caused the exchange to connect the user's telephone to an originating sender, which returned the user a dial tone. The sender then recorded the dialed digits and passed them to the originating marker, which selected an outgoing trunk and operated the various crossbar switch stages to connect the calling user to it. The originating marker then passed the trunk call completion requirements (type of pulsing, resistance of the trunk, etc.) and the called party's details to the sender and released. The sender then relayed this information to a terminating sender (which could be on either the same or a different exchange). This sender then used a terminating marker to connect the calling user, via the selected incoming trunk, to the called user, and caused the controlling relay set to send the ring signal to the called user's phone, and return ringing tone to the caller.\nThe crossbar switch itself was simple: exchange design moved all the logical decision-making to the common control elements, which were very reliable as relay sets. The design criteria specified only two hours of downtime for service every forty years, which was a large improvement over earlier electromechanical systems. The exchange design concept lent itself to incremental upgrades, as the control elements could be replaced separately from the call switching elements. The minimum size of a crossbar exchange was comparatively large, but in city areas with a large installed line capacity the whole exchange occupied less space than other exchange technologies of equivalent capacity. For this reason they were also typically the first switches to be replaced with digital systems, which were even smaller and more reliable.\nStarting with the 1XB switch, the later and more common method was based on the link principle, and used the switches as crosspoints. Each moving contact was multipled to the other contacts on the same level by bare-strip wiring, often nicknamed \"banjo wiring\". to a link on one of the inputs of a switch in the next stage. The switch could handle its portion of as many calls as it had levels or verticals. Thus an exchange with forty 10\u00d710 switches in four stages could have one hundred conversations in progress. The link principle was more efficient, but required a complex control system to find idle links through the switching fabric.\nThis meant common control, as described above: all the digits were recorded, then passed to the common control equipment, the marker, to establish the call at all the separate switch stages simultaneously. A marker-controlled crossbar system had in the marker a highly vulnerable central control; this was invariably protected by having duplicate markers. The great advantage was that the control occupancy on the switches was of the order of one second or less, representing the operate and release lags of the X-then-Y armatures of the switches. The only downside of common control was the need to provide digit recorders enough to deal with the greatest forecast originating traffic level on the exchange.\nThe Plessey TXK1 or 5005 design used an intermediate form, in which a clear path was marked through the switching fabric by distributed logic, and then closed through all at once.\nCrossbar exchanges remain in revenue service only in a few telephone networks. Preserved installations are maintained in museums, such as the Museum of Communications in Seattle, Washington, and the Science Museum in London.\nSemiconductor.\nSemiconductor implementations of crossbar switches typically consist of a set of input amplifiers or retimers connected to a series of interconnects within a semiconductor device. A similar set of interconnects are connected to output amplifiers or retimers. At each cross-point where the bars cross, a pass transistor is implemented which connects the bars. When the pass transistor is enabled, the input is connected to the output.\nAs computer technologies have improved, crossbar switches have found uses in systems such as the multistage interconnection networks that connect the various processing units in a uniform memory access parallel processor to the array of memory elements.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "45459", "revid": "50577581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45459", "title": "Control flow", "text": "How software progresses through its implementation\nIn software, control flow (or flow of control) describes how execution progresses from one command to the next. In many contexts, such as machine code and an imperative programming language, control progresses sequentially (to the command located immediately after the currently executing command) except when a command transfers control to another point \u2013 in which case the command is classified as a control flow command. Depending on context, other terms are used instead of \"command\". For example, in machine code, the typical term is \"instruction\" and in an imperative language, the typical term is \"statement\".\nAlthough an imperative language encodes control flow explicitly, languages of other programming paradigms are less focused on control flow. A declarative language specifies desired results without prescribing an order of operations. A functional language uses both language constructs and functions to control flow even though they are usually not called control flow statements.\nFor a central processing unit (CPU) instruction set, a control flow instruction often alters the program counter and is either an unconditional branch (a.k.a. jump) or a conditional branch. An alternative approach is predication which conditionally enables instructions instead of branching.\nAn asynchronous control flow transfer such as an interrupt or a signal alters the normal flow of control to a hander before returning control to where it was interrupted.\nOne way to attack software is to redirect the flow of execution. A variety of control-flow integrity techniques, including stack canaries, buffer overflow protection, shadow stacks, and vtable pointer verification, are used to defend against these attacks.\nStructure.\nControl flow is closely related to code structure. Control flows along lines defined by structure and the execution rules of a language. This general concept of structure is not be confused with structured programming which limits structure to sequencing, selection and iteration based on block organization.\nSequence.\nSequential execution is the most basic structure. Although not all code is sequential in nature, imperative code is.\nLabel.\nA label identifies a position in source code. Some control flow statements reference a label so that control jumps to the labeled line. Other than marking a position, a label has no other effect.\nSome languages limit a label to a number which is sometimes called a line number although that implies the inherent index of the line; not a label. None-the-less, such numeric labels are typically required to increment from top to bottom in a file even if not be sequential. For example, in BASIC:\n10 LET X = 3\n20 PRINT X\n30 GOTO 10\nIn many languages, a label is an alphanumeric identifier, usually appearing at the start of a line and immediately followed by a colon. For example, the following C code defines a label on line 3 which identifies a jump target point at the first statement that follows it; line 4.\nvoid f(bool ok) {\n if (ok) {\n goto success;\n return;\nsuccess:\n printf(\"OK\");\nBlock.\nMost languages provide for organizing sequences of code as a block. When used with a control statement, the beginning of a block provides a jump target. For example, in the following C code (which uses curly braces to delimit a block), control jumps from line 1 to 4 if done is false.\nif (done) {\n printf(\"All done\");\n} else {\n printf(\"Still workin' on it\");\nControl.\nMany control commands have been devised for programming languages. This section describes notable constructs; organized by functionality.\nFunction.\nA function provides for control flow in that when called, execution jumps to the start of the function's code and when it completes, control returns the calling point. In the following C code, control jumps from line 6 to 2 in order to call function . Then, after completing the function body (printing \"Hi\"), control returns to after the call, line 7.\nvoid foo() {\n printf(\"Hi\");\nvoid bar() {\n foo();\n printf(\"Done\");\nBranch.\nA branch command moves the point of execution from the point in the code that contains the command to the point that the command specifies.\nJump.\nA jump command unconditionally branches control to another point in the code, and is the most basic form of controlling the flow of code.\nIn a high-level language, this is often provided as a goto statement. Although the keyword may be upper or lower case or one or two words depending on the language, it is like: codice_1. When control reaches a goto statement, control then jumps to the statement that follows the indicated label. The goto statement is been considered harmful by many computer scientists; notably Dijkstra.\nConditional branch.\nA conditional statement jumps control based on the value of a Boolean expression. Common variations include:\nThe following Pascal code shows a simple if-then-else. The syntax is similar in Ada:\nif a &gt; 0 then\n writeln(\"yes\")\nelse\n writeln(\"no\");\nIn C:\nif (a &gt; 0) { \n puts(\"yes\");\n} else {\n puts(\"no\");\nIn bash:\nif [ $a -gt 0 ]; then\n echo \"yes\"\nelse\n echo \"no\"\nfi\nIn Python:\nif a &gt; 0: \n print(\"yes\")\nelse:\n print(\"no\")\nIn Lisp:\n(princ\n (if (plusp a)\n \"yes\"\n \"no\"))\nMultiway branch.\nA multiway branch jumps control based on matching values. There is usually a provision for a default action if no match is found. A switch statement can allow compiler optimizations, such as lookup tables. In dynamic languages, the cases may not be limited to constant expressions, and might extend to pattern matching, as in the shell script example on the right, where the codice_5 implements the default case as a glob matching any string. Case logic can also be implemented in functional form, as in SQL's codice_6 statement.\nThe following Pascal code shows a relatively simple switch statement. Pascal uses the keyword instead of .\ncase someChar of\n 'a': actionOnA;\n 'x': actionOnX;\n 'y','z':actionOnYandZ;\n else actionOnNoMatch;\nend;\nIn Ada:\ncase someChar is\n when 'a' =&gt; actionOnA;\n when 'x' =&gt; actionOnX;\n when 'y' | 'z' =&gt; actionOnYandZ;\n when others =&gt; actionOnNoMatch;\nend;\nIn C:\nswitch (someChar) {\n case 'a': \n actionOnA; \n break;\n case 'x': \n actionOnX; \n break;\n case 'y':\n case 'z': \n actionOnYandZ;\n break;\n default: \n actionOnNoMatch;\nIn Bash:\ncase $someChar in \n a) actionOnA ;;\n x) actionOnX ;;\n [yz]) actionOnYandZ ;;\n *) actionOnNoMatch ;;\nesac\nIn Lisp:\n(case some-char\n ((#\\a) action-on-a)\n ((#\\x) action-on-x)\n ((#\\y #\\z) action-on-y-and-z)\n (else action-on-no-match))\nIn Fortran:\nselect case (someChar)\n case ('a')\n actionOnA\n case ('x')\n actionOnX\n case ('y','z')\n actionOnYandZ\n case default\n actionOnNoMatch\nend select\nLoop.\nA loop is a sequence of statements, loop body, which is executed a number of times based on runtime state. The body is executed once for each item of a collection (\"definite iteration\"), until a condition is met (\"indefinite iteration\"), or infinitely. A loop inside the loop body is called a \"nested loop\". Early exit from a loop may be supported via a break statement.\nIn a functional programming language, such as Haskell and Scheme, both recursive and iterative processes are expressed with tail recursive procedures instead of looping constructs that are syntactic.\nNumeric.\nA relatively simple yet useful loop iterates over a range of numeric values. A simple form starts at an integer value, ends at a larger integer value and iterates for each integer value between. Often, the increment can be any integer value; even negative to loop from a larger to a smaller value.\nExample in BASIC:\nFOR I = 1 TO N\n xxx\nNEXT I\nExample in Pascal:\nfor I := 1 to N do begin\n xxx\nend;\nExample in Fortran:\nDO I = 1,N\n xxx\nEND DO\nIn many programming languages, only integers can be used at all or reliably. As a floating-point number is represented imprecisely due to hardware constraints, the following loop might iterate 9 or 10 times, depending on various factors such as rounding error, hardware, compiler. Furthermore, if the increment of X occurs by repeated addition, accumulated rounding errors may mean that the value of X in each iteration can differ quite significantly from the commonly expected sequence of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.0.\n for X := 0.1 step 0.1 to 1.0 do\nCondition-controlled.\nSome loop constructs iterate until a condition is true. Some variations test the condition at the start of the loop; others test at the end. If the test is at the start, the body may be skipped completely. At the end, the body is always executed at least once.\nExample in Visual Basic:\nDO WHILE (test)\n xxx\nLOOP\nExample in Pascal:\nrepeat\n xxx\nuntil test;\nExample in C family of pre-test:\nwhile (test) {\n xxx\nExample in C family of post-test:\ndo\n xxx\nwhile (test);\nAlthough using the keyword, the 3-part, c-style loop is condition-based; not a numeric-based construct. The condition, 2nd part, is evaluated before each loop so the loop is pre-test. The 1st part is a place to initialize state and the 3rd part is for incrementing for the next iteration, but both aspects can be performed elsewhere. The following C code implements the logic of a numeric loop that iterates for i from 0 to n-1.\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {\n xxx\nEnumeration.\nSome loop constructs enumerate the items of a collection; iterating for each item.\nExample in Smalltalk:\nsomeCollection do: [:eachElement |xxx].\nExample in Pascal:\nfor Item in Collection do begin xxx end;\nExample in Raku:\nExample in TCL:\nExample in PHP:\nExample in Java:\nCollection&lt;String&gt; coll; \nExample in C#:\nExample in PowerShell where 'foreach' is an alias of 'ForEach-Object':\nExample in Fortran:\nforall ( index = first:last:step... )\nScala has for-expressions, which generalise collection-controlled loops, and also support other uses, such as asynchronous programming. Haskell has do-expressions and comprehensions, which together provide similar function to for-expressions in Scala.\nLoop-and-a-half problem.\nCommon loop structures sometimes result in duplicated code, either repeated statements or repeated conditions. This arises for various reasons and has various proposed solutions to eliminate or minimize code duplication. Other than the traditional unstructured solution of a \"goto\" statement, general structured solutions include having a conditional (\"if\" statement) inside the loop (possibly duplicating the condition but not the statements) or wrapping repeated logic in a function (so there is a duplicated function call, but the statements are not duplicated).\nA common case is where the start of the loop is always executed, but the end may be skipped on the last iteration. This was dubbed by Dijkstra a loop which is performed \"\"n\" and a half times\", and is now called the \"loop-and-a-half problem\". Common cases include reading data in the first part, checking for end of data, and then processing the data in the second part; or processing, checking for end, and then preparing for the next iteration. In these cases, the first part of the loop is executed &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; times, but the second part is only executed &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; times.\nThis problem has been recognized at least since 1967 by Knuth, with Wirth suggesting solving it via early loop exit. Since the 1990s this has been the most commonly taught solution, using a \"break\" statement, as in:\n loop\n \"statements\"\n if \"condition\" break\n \"statements\"\n repeat\nA subtlety of this solution is that the condition is the \"opposite\" of a usual \"while\" condition: rewriting while \"condition\" ... repeat with an exit in the middle requires reversing the condition: loop ... if not \"condition\" exit ... repeat. The loop with test in the middle control structure explicitly supports the loop-an-a-half use case, without reversing the condition.\nUnstructured.\nA loop construct provides for structured completion criteria that either results in another iteration or continuing execution after the loop statement. But, various unstructured control flow constructs are supported by many languages.\nEarly exit.\nEarly exit jumps control to after the loop body For example, when searching a list, can stop looping when the item is found. Some programming languages provide a statement such as codice_13 (most languages), codice_14 (Visual Basic), or codice_15 (Perl).\nIn the following Ada code, the loop exits when X is 0.\nloop\n Get(X);\n if X = 0 then\n exit;\n end if;\n DoSomething(X);\nend loop;\nA more idiomatic style uses :\nloop\n Get(X);\n exit when X = 0;\n DoSomething(X);\nend loop;\nPython supports conditional execution of code depending on whether a loop was exited early (with a codice_13 statement) or not by using an else-clause with the loop. In the following Python code, the codice_17 clause is linked to the codice_18 statement, and not the inner codice_19 statement. Both Python's codice_18 and codice_21 loops support such an else clause, which is executed only if early exit of the loop has not occurred.\nfor n in set_of_numbers:\n if isprime(n):\n print(\"Set contains a prime number\")\n break\nelse:\n print(\"Set did not contain any prime numbers\")\nMulti-level breaks.\nSome languages support breaking out of nested loops; in theory circles, these are called multi-level breaks. One common use example is searching a multi-dimensional table. This can be done either via multilevel breaks (break out of \"N\" levels), as in bash and PHP, or via labeled breaks (break out and continue at given label), as in Ada, Go, Java, Rust and Perl. Alternatives to multilevel breaks include single breaks, together with a state variable which is tested to break out another level; exceptions, which are caught at the level being broken out to; placing the nested loops in a function and using return to effect termination of the entire nested loop; or using a label and a goto statement. Neither C nor C++ currently have multilevel break or named loops, and the usual alternative is to use a goto to implement a labeled break. However, the inclusion of this feature has been proposed, and was added to C2Y., following the Java syntax. Python does not have a multilevel break or continue \u2013 this was proposed in https://, and rejected on the basis that the added complexity was not worth the rare legitimate use.\nThe notion of multi-level breaks is of some interest in theoretical computer science, because it gives rise to what is today called the \"Kosaraju hierarchy\". In 1973 S. Rao Kosaraju refined the structured program theorem by proving that it is possible to avoid adding additional variables in structured programming, as long as arbitrary-depth, multi-level breaks from loops are allowed. Furthermore, Kosaraju proved that a strict hierarchy of programs exists: for every integer \"n\", there exists a program containing a multi-level break of depth \"n\" that cannot be rewritten as a program with multi-level breaks of depth less than \"n\" without introducing added variables.\nIn his 2004 textbook, David Watt uses Tennent's notion of sequencer to explain the similarity between multi-level breaks and return statements. Watt notes that a class of sequencers known as \"escape sequencers\", defined as \"sequencer that terminates execution of a textually enclosing command or procedure\", encompasses both breaks from loops (including multi-level breaks) and return statements. As commonly implemented, however, return sequencers may also carry a (return) value, whereas the break sequencer as implemented in contemporary languages usually cannot.\nMiddle test.\nThe following structure was proposed by Dahl in 1972:\n loop loop\n xxx1 read(char);\n while test; while not atEndOfFile;\n xxx2 write(char);\n repeat; repeat;\nThe construction here can be thought of as a do loop with the while check in the middle, which allows clear loop-and-a-half logic. Further, by omitting individual components, this single construction can replace several constructions in most programming languages. If \"xxx1\" is omitted, we get a loop with the test at the top (a traditional while loop). If \"xxx2\" is omitted, we get a loop with the test at the bottom, equivalent to a do while loop in many languages. If while is omitted, we get an infinite loop. This construction also allows keeping the same polarity of the condition even when in the middle, unlike early exit, which requires reversing the polarity (adding a not), functioning as until instead of while.\nThis structure is not widely supported, with most languages instead using if ... break for conditional early exit.\nThis is supported by some languages, such as Forth, where the syntax is BEGIN ... WHILE ... REPEAT, and the shell script languages Bourne shell (codice_22) and bash, where the syntax is while ... do ... done or until ... do ... done, as:\nwhile\n statement-1\n statement-2\n condition\ndo\n statement-a\n statement-b\ndone\nThe shell syntax works because the while (or until) loop accepts a list of commands as a condition, formally:\n while \"test-commands\"; do \"consequent-commands\"; done\nThe value (exit status) of the list of \"test-commands\" is the value of the \"last\" command, and these can be separated by newlines, resulting in the idiomatic form above.\nSimilar constructions are possible in C and C++ with the comma operator, and other languages with similar constructs, which allow shoehorning a list of statements into the while condition:\nwhile (statement_1, statement_2, condition) {\n statement_a;\n statement_b;\nWhile legal, this is marginal, and it is primarily used, if at all, only for short modify-then-test cases, as in:\nwhile (read_string(s), strlen(s) &gt; 0) {\nLoop variants and invariants.\nLoop variants and loop invariants are used to express correctness of loops.\nIn practical terms, a loop variant is an integer expression which has an initial non-negative value. The variant's value must decrease during each loop iteration but must never become negative during the correct execution of the loop. Loop variants are used to guarantee that loops will terminate.\nA loop invariant is an assertion which must be true before the first loop iteration and remain true after each iteration. This implies that when a loop terminates correctly, both the exit condition and the loop invariant are satisfied. Loop invariants are used to monitor specific properties of a loop during successive iterations.\nSome programming languages, such as Eiffel contain native support for loop variants and invariants. In other cases, support is an add-on, such as the Java Modeling Language's specification for http:// in Java.\nLoop sublanguage.\nSome Lisp dialects provide an extensive sublanguage for describing Loops. An early example can be found in Conversional Lisp of Interlisp. Common Lisp provides a Loop macro which implements such a sublanguage.\nNon-local.\nMany programming languages, especially those favoring more dynamic styles of programming, offer constructs for non-local control flow which cause execution to jump from the current execution point to a predeclared point. Notable examples follow.\nCondition handling.\nThe earliest Fortran compilers supported statements for handling exceptional conditions including codice_31, codice_32, and codice_33. In the interest of machine independence, they were not included in FORTRAN IV and the Fortran 66 Standard. However, since Fortran 2003 it is possible to test for numerical issues via calls to functions in the codice_34 module.\nPL/I has some 22 standard conditions (e.g., ZERODIVIDE SUBSCRIPTRANGE ENDFILE) which can be raised and which can be intercepted by: ON \"condition\" action; Programmers can also define and use their own named conditions.\nLike the \"unstructured if\", only one statement can be specified so in many cases a GOTO is needed to decide where flow of control should resume.\nUnfortunately, some implementations had a substantial overhead in both space and time (especially SUBSCRIPTRANGE), so many programmers tried to avoid using conditions.\nA typical example of syntax:\n ON \"condition\" GOTO \"label\"\nException handling.\nMany modern languages support an exception handling construct that is structured; does not rely on jump semantics (goto). Generally, exceptional control flow starts with an exception object being thrown (a.k.a. raised). Control then proceeds to the inner-most exception handler for the call stack. If the handler handles the exception, then flow control reverts to normal. Otherwise, control proceeds outward to containing handlers until one handles the exception or the program reaches the outermost scope and exits. As control flows to progressively outer handlers, aspects that would normally occur such as popping the call stack are handled automatically.\nThe following C++ code demonstrates structured exception handling. If an exception propagates from the execution of and the exception object type matches one of the types specified in a catch clause, then that clause is executed. For example, if an exception of type is propagated by , then control jumps from line 2 to 4 and the message \"Caught SomeException\" is printed and then control jumps to after the statement, line 8. If an exception of any other type is propagated, then control jumps from line 2 to 6. If no exception, then control jumps from 2 to 8.\ntry {\n doSomething();\n} catch (const SomeException&amp; e)\n std::println(\"Caught SomeException: {}\", e.what());\n} catch (...) {\n std::println(\"Unknown error\");\ndoNextThing();\nMany languages use the C++ keywords (, and ), but some languages use other keywords. For example, Ada uses to introduce an exception handler and instead of . AppleScript incorporates placeholders in the syntax to extract information about the exception as shown in the following AppleScript code.\ntry\n set myNumber to myNumber / 0\non error e number n from f to t partial result pr\n if ( e = \"Can't divide by zero\" ) then display dialog \"You must not do that\"\nend try\nIn many languages (including Object Pascal, D, Java, C#, and Python) a clause at the end of a statement is executed at the end of the try statement; whether an exception propagates from the rest of the or not. The following C# code ensures that the stream is closed.\nFileStream stream = null;\ntry\n stream = new FileStream(\"logfile.txt\", FileMode.Create);\n return ProcessStuff(stream);\nfinally\n if (stream != null)\n stream.Close();\nSince this pattern is common, C# provides the statement to ensure cleanup. In the following code, even if ProcessStuff() propagates an exception, the codice_35 object is released. Python's codice_36 statement and Ruby's block argument to codice_37 are used to similar effect.\nusing (FileStream stream = new(\"logfile.txt\", FileMode.Create))\n return ProcessStuff(stream);\nEvent-based early exit from nested loop.\nZahn's construct was proposed in 1974, and discussed in . A modified version is presented here.\n exitwhen EventA or EventB or EventC;\n xxx\n exits\n EventA: actionA\n EventB: actionB\n EventC: actionC\n endexit;\nexitwhen is used to specify the events which may occur within \"xxx\",\ntheir occurrence is indicated by using the name of the event as a statement. When some event does occur, the relevant action is carried out, and then control passes just after endexit. This construction provides a very clear separation between determining that some situation applies, and the action to be taken for that situation.\nexitwhen is conceptually similar to exception handling, and exceptions or similar constructs are used for this purpose in many languages.\nThe following simple example involves searching a two-dimensional table for a particular item.\n exitwhen found or missing;\n for I := 1 to N do\n for J := 1 to M do\n if table[I,J] = target then found;\n missing;\n exits\n found: print (\"item is in table\");\n missing: print (\"item is not in table\");\n endexit;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
