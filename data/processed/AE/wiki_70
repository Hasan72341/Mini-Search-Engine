The concept is almost invariably associated with intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying thermonuclear warheads, even if not strictly being limited to them. An intermediate case is the multiple reentry vehicle (MRV) missile which carries several warheads which are dispersed but not individually aimed. \nThe first true MIRV design was the Minuteman III, first successfully tested in 1968 and introduced into actual use in\u00a01970. The Minuteman III held three smaller W62 warheads, with yields of about each in place of the single W56 used on the Minuteman II. From 1970 to 1975, the United States would remove approximately 550 earlier versions of the Minuteman ICBM in the Strategic Air Command's (SAC) arsenal and replace them with the new Minuteman IIIs outfitted with a MIRV payload, increasing their overall effectiveness. The smaller power of the warheads used (W62, W78 and W87) was offset by increasing the accuracy of the system, allowing it to attack the same hard targets as the larger, less accurate, W56. The MMIII was introduced specifically to address the Soviet construction of an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system around Moscow; MIRV allowed the US to overwhelm any conceivable ABM system without increasing the size of their own missile fleet. The Soviets responded by adding MIRV to their R-36 design, first with three warheads in 1975, and eventually up to ten in later versions. While the United States phased out the use of MIRVs in ICBMs in 2014 to comply with New START, Russia continues to develop new ICBM designs using the technology.\nThe introduction of MIRV led to a major change in the strategic balance. Previously, with one warhead per missile, it was conceivable that one could build a defense that used missiles to attack individual warheads. Any increase in missile fleet by the enemy could be countered by a similar increase in interceptors. With MIRV, a single new enemy missile meant that multiple interceptors would have to be built, meaning that it was much less expensive to increase the attack than the defense. This cost-exchange ratio was so heavily biased towards the attacker that the concept of mutual assured destruction became the leading concept in strategic planning and ABM systems were severely limited in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in order to avoid a massive arms race.\nIn June 2017 the United States finished converting its Minuteman III missiles back to using a single reentry vehicle system, as part of its obligations under the New START treaty.\nOn November 21, 2024, Russia used a conventionally-armed MIRV system on the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile to attack the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, marking their first usage in combat.\nPurpose.\nThe military purpose of a MIRV is fourfold:\nMIRV land-based ICBMs were considered destabilizing because they tended to put a premium on striking first. The world's first MIRV\u2014US Minuteman III missile of 1970\u2014threatened to rapidly increase the US's deployable nuclear arsenal and thus the possibility that it would have enough bombs to destroy virtually all of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons and negate any significant retaliation. Later on the US feared the Soviet's MIRVs because Soviet missiles had a greater throw-weight and could thus put more warheads on each missile than the US could. For example, the US MIRVs might have increased their warhead per missile count by a factor of 6 while the Soviets increased theirs by a factor of 10. Furthermore, the US had a much smaller proportion of its nuclear arsenal in ICBMs than the Soviets. Bombers could not be outfitted with MIRVs so their capacity would not be multiplied. Thus the US did not seem to have as much potential for MIRV usage as the Soviets. However, the US had a larger number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which could be outfitted with MIRVs, and helped offset the ICBM disadvantage. It is because of their first-strike capability that land-based MIRVs were banned under the START II agreement. START II was ratified by the Russian Duma on 14 April 2000, but Russia withdrew from the treaty in 2002 after the US withdrew from the ABM treaty.\nOperation.\nIn a MIRV, the main rocket motor (or booster) pushes a \"bus\" into a free-flight suborbital ballistic flight path. After the boost phase, the bus maneuvers using small on-board rocket motors and a computerized inertial guidance system. It takes up a ballistic trajectory that will deliver a re-entry vehicle containing a warhead to a target and then releases a warhead on that trajectory. It then maneuvers to a different trajectory, releasing another warhead, and repeats the process for all warheads.\nThe precise technical details are closely guarded military secrets, to hinder any development of enemy counter-measures. The bus's on-board propellant limits the distances between targets of individual warheads to perhaps a few hundred kilometers. Some warheads may use small hypersonic airfoils during the descent to gain additional cross-range distance. Additionally, some buses (e.g. the British Chevaline system) can release decoys to confuse interception devices and radars, such as aluminized balloons or electronic noisemakers.\nAccuracy is crucial because doubling the accuracy decreases the needed warhead energy by a factor of four for radiation damage and by a factor of eight for blast damage. Navigation system accuracy and the available geophysical information limits the warhead target accuracy. Accuracy is expressed as circular error probable (CEP). This is the radius of the circle that the warhead has a 50 percent chance of falling into when aimed at the center. CEP is about 90\u2013100 m for the Trident II and Peacekeeper missiles.\nMRV.\nA multiple re-entry vehicle (MRV) system for a ballistic missile deploys multiple warheads above a single aimpoint which then drift apart, producing a cluster bomb-like effect. These warheads are not individually targetable. The advantage of an MRV over a single warhead is the increased effectiveness due to the greater coverage; this increases the overall damage produced within the center of the pattern, making it far greater than the damage possible from any single warhead in the MRV cluster; this makes for an efficient area-attack weapon and makes interception by anti-ballistic missiles more challenging due to the number of warheads being deployed at once.\nImproved warhead designs allow smaller warheads for a given yield, while better electronics and guidance systems allow greater accuracy. As a result, MIRV technology has proven more attractive than MRV for advanced nations. Multiple-warhead missiles require both a miniaturized physics package and a lower mass re-entry vehicle, both of which are highly advanced technologies. As a result, single-warhead missiles are more attractive for nations with less advanced or less productive nuclear technology. The United States first deployed MRV warheads on the Polaris A-3 SLBM in 1964 on the USS Daniel Webster. The Polaris A-3 missile carried three warheads each having an approximate yield of . This system was also used by the Royal Navy who also retained MRV with the Chevaline upgrade, though the number of warheads in Chevaline was reduced to two due to the ABM counter-measures carried. The Soviet Union deployed 3 MRVs on the R-27U SLBM and 3 MRVs on the R-36P ICBM. Refer to atmospheric re-entry for more details.\nCombat usage.\nOn November 21, 2024, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia launched an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, striking Dnipro. Western officials stated the missile used a MIRV system, marking their first use in combat. The night attack was reported to see six sequential vertical flashes, each comprising a cluster of up to six individual projectiles. Ukraine's air force initially claimed an intercontinental ballistic missile (range greater than 5,500 km) was used, and Ukrainian media initially reported it was an RS-26 Rubezh IRBM with range 5,800 km. The US and Russia confirmed it was intermediate-range (3,000\u20135,500 km), but the Pentagon stated it was based on the RS-26 IRBM. It was fired from the Astrakhan region 700 km away. UN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric called the use of the intermediate-range weapon \"concerning and worrying\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This gave Q-ships the chance to open fire and sink them.\nThey were used by the British Royal Navy and the German \"Kaiserliche Marine\" during the First World War and by the Royal Navy, the \"Kriegsmarine\", the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the United States Navy during the Second World War.\nThough legally recognised as an acceptable tactic of military deception, they have attracted much controversy, enjoying only marginal success.\nEtymology.\n\"Q-ship\" is short for Queenstown in Ireland, as Haulbowline Dockyard, in Cork Harbour, was responsible for the conversion of many mercantile steamers to armed decoy ships during the First World War, although the majority appear to have been converted in larger navy yards such as Devonport.\nEarly uses of the concept.\nThe general idea and legal framework for the Q-ship derives from the classic ruse de guerre of \"sailing under false colours\". As a long standing element of naval tactics, warships may legally disguise themselves in various ways in transit so long as the proper flags are hoisted before firing commences. Numerous examples exist of the tactic, which is used both defensively and offensively.\nExamples of the tactic used against commerce raiders are in the 1670s and French disguised brigs during the French Revolutionary Wars. An example of the latter was beaten back by the privateer lugger \"Vulture\" out of Jersey.\nFirst World War.\nRoyal Navy.\nIn 1915, during the First Battle of the Atlantic, Britain was in need of a countermeasure against the U-boats that were harassing its sea lanes. Convoys, which had proved effective in earlier times (and would again prove effective during the Second World War), were rejected by the resource-strapped Admiralty and the independent captains. Depth charges would start to become available only in early 1916 and so almost the only chance of sinking a submarine was by gunfire or by ramming while on the surface.\nSubmarines could attack by torpedo or by deck gun. Torpedoes can be used while the vessel is submerged and invisible to her target, and deck guns are used on the surface. Torpedoes were expensive, unreliable, and a submarine only carried a limited number of them. Ammunition for a deck gun, oppositely, was inexpensive and plentiful in comparison. As a result, submarine captains preferred to surface and use their deck gun on most targets. However, when encountering a warship, submarine commanders could recognise the threat they posed and use a torpedo, or simply not engage.\nA solution to this was the creation of the Q-ship, one of the most closely guarded secrets of the war. Their codename referred to the vessels' home port, Queenstown, in Ireland. They became known by the Germans as a \"U-Boot-Falle\" (\"U-boat trap\"). A Q-ship would appear to be an unarmed merchant ship and so an easy target but in fact was a warship that carried hidden armaments. A typical Q-ship might resemble a tramp steamer sailing alone in an area that a U-boat was reported to be operating.\nBy seeming to be a suitable target for the U-boat's deck gun, a Q-ship was intended to lure a submarine into surfacing to attack. Once the U-boat was vulnerable, perhaps even gulled further by pretence of some crew dressed as civilian mariners \"abandoning ship\" and taking to a boat, the Q-ship would drop its panels and immediately open fire with its deck guns. At the same time, the vessel would reveal her true colours by raising the White Ensign (the Royal Navy flag). When successfully fooled, a U-boat could quickly become overwhelmed by several guns to its one or defer from firing and try to submerge before it became mortally wounded.\nThe first Q-ship victory was on 23 June 1915, when the submarine , cooperating with the decoy vessel \"Taranaki\", sank off Eyemouth. The first victory by an unassisted Q-ship came on 24 July 1915 when sank . The civilian crew of \"Prince Charles\" received a cash award. The following month an even smaller converted fishing trawler renamed successfully destroyed near Great Yarmouth. \"Inverlyon\" was an unpowered sailing ship fitted with a small 3-pounder (47\u00a0mm) gun. The British crew fired nine rounds from their 3-pounder into \"UB-4\" at close range, sinking her with the loss of all hands despite the attempt of \"Inverlyon\"'s commander to rescue one surviving German submariner.\nOn 19 August 1915, sank , which was preparing to attack the nearby merchant ship \"Nicosian\". About a dozen of the U-boat sailors survived and swam towards the merchant ship. The commanding officer, allegedly fearing that they might scuttle her, ordered the survivors to be shot in the water and sent a boarding party to kill all who had made it aboard. This became known as the \"Baralong incident\".\n (Q.5) sank on 22 March 1916. Her commander, Gordon Campbell, was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). New Zealanders Lieutenant Andrew Dougall Blair and Sub-Lieutenant William Edward Sanders faced three U-boats simultaneously in \"Helgoland\" (Q.17) while becalmed and without engines or wireless. Forced to return fire early, they managed to sink one U-boat and avoid two torpedo attacks. Sanders was promoted to lieutenant commander, eventually commanding the topsail schooner in command of which he was awarded the Victoria Cross for an action on 30 April 1917 with , which was severely damaged. \"Helgoland\", while the ship sustained heavy shellfire, waited until the submarine was within , whereupon he hoisted the White Ensign and \"Prize\" opened fire. The submarine appeared to sink and he claimed a victory. However, the badly damaged submarine managed to struggle back to port. With his ship accurately described by the survivors of \"U-93\", Sanders and his crewmen were all killed in action when they attempted a surprise attack on on 14 August 1917.\nAccording to \"Warships of World War I\" by H. M. LeFleming, the Royal Navy converted 58 from merchant ships (18 were sunk by U-boats), in addition to 40 s and 20 PC-boats. However \"Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1906\u20131921\" claims that no fewer than 157 named submarine decoy vessels converted from other types of ship, in addition to another ten whose name was unknown. It agrees with LeFleming about the number of sloops and PC-boats. These ones were completed as Q-ships, disguised as coastal freighters and differed from regular service PC-boats. None was lost in the war. The Flower-class sloops were designed on merchant ship lines thus making them easily adaptable for conversion to Q-ships, 39 being completed as such while the other was converted after being torpedoed. These all had single funnels as the merchant ship silhouette was left to the builders. The \"Flower-Q's\" were employed mainly on convoy and anti-submarine work. Nine were lost during the war.\nAfter the war, it was concluded that the effectiveness of the Q-ship initiative had been greatly overrated by diverting skilled seamen from other duties without sinking enough U-boats to justify the strategy. Estimates differ because of the uncertainty of the attribution of lost submarines, but in a total of approximately 150 engagements, British Q-ships destroyed or assisted in the loss of around 12 to 15 U-boats and damaged 60, at a cost of 27 to 38 Q-ships lost out of about 200. Q-ships were thus responsible for under 10% of all U-boats sunk, ranking them well below the use of ordinary minefields in effectiveness. Around half of Q-ship successes took place in June to September 1915, after which the ships were much less effective. With the second round of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, Q-ships sunk only 3 submarines, dwarfed by the ~28 sunk by undisguised warships.\nImperial German Navy.\nThe Imperial German Navy commissioned six Q-boats during the Great War for the Baltic Sea into the \"Handelsschutzflottille\". None was successful in destroying enemy submarines. The German Q-ship \"Schiff K\" heavily damaged the Russian submarine \"Gepard\" of the on 27 May 1916. The famous \"M\u00f6we\" and \"Wolf\" were merchant raiders, vessels designed to disrupt enemy trade and sink merchantmen, rather than attack enemy warships.\nSecond World War.\nGermany.\nGermany employed at least 13 Q-ships, including the \"Sch\u00fcrbeck\" which sank the British submarine . The German , which sank a number of ships with a total tonnage of 145,960 t including the Norwegian tanker \"Tirranna\" on 10 June 1940, was more of a merchant raider.\nJapan.\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy converted the 2,205-ton merchant ship \"Delhi Maru\" into a Q-ship. On 15 January 1944, she departed from Nagaura (now Sodegaura on Tokyo Bay) on her first mission in company with the submarine chaser \"Ch-50\" and the netlayer \"Tatu Maru\". At 22:00, the vessels were detected by the submarine , which launched three torpedoes. \"Delhi Maru\" was hit by all three on her port bow; following a number of internal explosions, she broke in two, the forward section sinking immediately and the aft section sinking later in heavy seas. Although \" Swordfish\" was depth charged by \"Ch-50\", she escaped unscathed.\nUnited Kingdom.\nNine Q-ships were commissioned by the Royal Navy in September and October 1939 for work in the North Atlantic:\n\"Prunella\" and \"Edgehill\" were torpedoed and sunk on 21 and 29 June 1940 without even sighting a U-boat. The rest of the vessels were paid off in March 1941 without successfully accomplishing any mission.\nUnited States.\nBy 12 January 1942, the British Admiralty's intelligence community had noted a \"heavy concentration\" of U-boats off the \"North American seaboard from New York to Cape Race\" and passed along this fact to the United States Navy. That day, under \"Kapit\u00e4nleutnant\" Reinhard Hardegen, torpedoed and sank the British steamship \"Cyclops\", inaugurating \"Paukenschlag\" (literally, \"a strike on the kettledrum\" and sometimes referred to in English as \"Operation Drumbeat\"). U-boat commanders found peacetime conditions prevailing along the coast: towns and cities were not blacked out and navigational buoys remained lit; shipping followed normal routines and \"carried the normal lights.\" \"Paukenschlag\" had caught the United States unprepared.\nLosses mounted rapidly. On January 20, 1942, Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet (Cominch), Earnest J. King, sent a coded dispatch to Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier (CESF), requesting immediate consideration of the manning and fitting-out of \"Queen\" ships to be operated as an antisubmarine measure. The result was \"Project LQ.\"\nFive vessels were acquired and converted secretly at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine:\nThe careers of all five ships were almost entirely unsuccessful and very short, with USS \"Atik\" sunk on its first patrol with all hands on 26 March 1942. COMINCH strongly criticized the program and all Q-ships patrols ended in 1943.\nAmerican Q-ships also operated in the Pacific Ocean. One was formerly the lumber transport \"Coos Bay\" which was converted to Q-ship duty as project \"Love William\". \"Anacapa\" was not successful in engaging any enemy submarines, although she is believed to have damaged two friendly subs with depth charges when they were improperly operating in her vicinity. \"Anacapa\" was also withdrawn from Q-ship duty in 1943 and served out the remainder of World War II as an armed transport in the South Pacific and Aleutian Islands.\nThe US Navy did not use a consistent hull classification symbol for its Q-ships (AG, AK, AO, IX and PYc were all used). That and the unprecedented use of duplicate hull numbers for \"Asterion\" and \"Atik\" reflected the great secrecy attached to those ships.\nProposed use against modern pirates.\nAttacks on merchant ships by pirates originating on the Somalia coast have brought suggestions from some security experts that Q-ships be used again to tempt pirates into attacking a well-defended ship.\nSurvivors.\nA surviving example of the Q-ships is HMS \"Saxifrage\", a Flower-class sloop of the \"Anchusa\" group completed in 1918. She was renamed in 1922 and served as the London Division RNR drill ship until 1988, when she was sold privately and remained moored at King's Reach on the Thames until 2016, when her mooring was sold to Thames Water to facilitate the Thames Tideway Tunnel project. \"President\" was towed to Chatham Dockyard, on the River Medway, in Kent, where she is now abandoned.\nQ-ships in fiction.\nThe Alfred Noyes poem \"Kilmeny\" is about a Q-ship, a British trawler equipped with two deck guns that destroys a German submarine during World War I.\nIn Ernest Hemingway's novel \"Islands in the Stream\", the main character, Thomas Hudson, commands a Q-ship for the US Navy around Cuba as he hunts the survivors of a sunken German U-boat.\nIn Edward L. Beach Jr.'s novel \"Run Silent, Run Deep\", Japanese Q-ships make two appearances, with one surprising the Walrus and the second being attacked by the \"Eel\" in the final battle of the story.\nMalcolm Lowry's novel \"Under the Volcano\" (1947) tells the story of Geoffrey Firmin, an alcoholic British consul in the small Mexican town of Quauhnahuac, on the Day of the Dead, 2 November 1938. Geoffrey Firmin reflects back to his time as a naval officer during World War I, when he was court-martialed and subsequently decorated for his actions aboard a Q-ship (the captured German officers disappeared and were allegedly burned alive in the boiler).\nIn the Clive Cussler book series \"Oregon Files\", the main base of operations is a Q-ship, a converted lumber carrier. The crew are mercenaries and former US covert and military personnel who carry out missions around the world in support of US policy while earning their living performing mercenary operations.\nThe 1951 movie \"Operation Pacific\" features a battle with a Q-Ship by the fictional submarine USS \"Thunderfish\", inspired by an encounter with an enemy ship by the USS \"Growler\".\nIn science fiction.\nAs with other naval concepts, the idea of a Q-ship has also been applied to space vessels in fictional works:\nQ-ships feature prominently in David Weber's Honor Harrington series of books. Harrington destroys a Q-ship in the first novel, \"On Basilisk Station\", and commands a squadron of Q-ships in the sixth novel, \"Honor Among Enemies\". In the tenth book in the series, \"War of Honor\", Thomas Bachfisch commands a pair of privately owned Q-ships.\nIn the January/February 2020 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact, Joel Richards has a short story, \"Q-ship Militant\".\nIn DC Comics' \"Star Spangled War Stories\" #71 (reprinted in their \"Weird War\" #1), the story \"The End of the Sea Wolf!\" is a postwar \"flashback\" story of a U-boat commander engaging a Q-ship in the Second World War.\nThe 2024 novel: \"The Worst Fugitives In The Star Nation\" is part of the\n\"Dumb Luck And Dead Heroes\" Series, (Book Seven) by Skyler Ramirez.\neBook ISBN: 978-1-964457-18-5, Paperback ISBN: 978-1-964457-17-8.\nIn chapter 11 entitled: \"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,\" the Q-ship HMS Odysseus is introduced. She is very deadly and very efficient. She is designed to fight off pirates and other enemy ships, as well as to ferry around a platoon of Marines. From the outside, the Q-ship looks like any other bulk freighter, but she is in reality a heavy cruiser with tremendous fire-power.\nIn 1983, Q-ships were introduced to Steven Cole's tactical board wargame Starfleet Command in the magazine Nexus issue #4, which featured scenarios involving Q-ships in the game setting. It became a staple of the Star Fleet Battles universe. Q-ships in the gaming universe were warships built to mimic the appearance and electromagnetic signature of a civilian freighters but with hidden weapons, fake cargo, and robust shields. Their function was to lure pirates or enemy raiders into attacking them. Though chunky and slow, they possessed heavy shields and firepower. In the game, a Q-ship could not be detected until it powered up war devices that were not common to commercial vessels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These vessels were small, fast, and inexpensive to build, and were valued for their maneuverability and speed. However, PT boats were hampered at the beginning of the war by ineffective torpedoes, limited armament, and comparatively fragile construction that limited some of the variants to coastal waters. In the US Navy they were organized in Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons (MTBRONs).\nPT boats were very different from the first generation of torpedo boats, which had been developed at the end of the 19th century and featured a displacement hull form. These first generation torpedo boats rode low in the water, displaced up to 300 tons, and had a top speed of . During World War I Italy, the US, and UK developed the first high-performance, gasoline-powered motor torpedo boats (often with top speeds over ) and corresponding torpedo tactics, but these projects were all quickly disbanded after the Armistice. Design of World War II PT boats continued to exploit some of the advances in planing hull design borrowed from offshore powerboat racing and used multiple lightweight but more powerful marinized aircraft-derived V-12 engines, and thus were able to advance in both size and speed.\nDuring World War II, PT boats engaged enemy warships, transports, tankers, barges, and sampans. Some were converted into gunboats which could be effective against enemy small craft, especially armored barges used by the Japanese for inter-island transport. Several saw service with the Philippine Navy, where they were named \"Q-boats\". Primary anti-ship armament on the standard PT boat was four 21-inch Mark 8 torpedoes, each of which had a TNT warhead and a range of at . Two twin .50-inch (12.7\u00a0mm) M2 Browning heavy machine guns were mounted for anti-aircraft defense and general fire support. Some boats carried a Oerlikon cannon. Propulsion was via a trio of Packard 4M-2500 and later 5M-2500 supercharged gasoline-fueled, liquid-cooled V-12 marine engines.\nNicknamed \"the mosquito fleet\" and \"devil boats\" by the Japanese, the PT boat squadrons were hailed for their daring and earned a durable place in the public imagination that remains strong into the 21st century. Their role was replaced in the U.S. Navy by fast attack craft.\nDevelopment.\nAt the outbreak of war in August 1914, W. Albert Hickman devised the first procedures and tactics for employing fast maneuverable seaworthy torpedo motorboats against capital ships, and he presented his proposal to Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, the chief of the US Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair. In September 1914, Hickman completed plans for a \"Sea Sled\" torpedo boat and submitted these to the Navy in hopes of obtaining a contract. While favorably received, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels rejected the proposal since the US was not at war, but Hickman was advised to submit his plans and proposal to the British Admiralty, which was done the following month. The Admiralty found it interesting but thought that \"no fast boat of 50' to 60'\nlength would be sufficiently seaworthy\", so Hickman built and launched his own privately financed sea sled capable of carrying a single 18-inch Whitehead Mark 5 torpedo. In February 1915, this Hickman sea sled demonstrated speeds in rough winter seas off Boston to both US and foreign representatives, but again he received no contracts. The Admiralty representative for this sea sled demonstration was Lieutenant G. C. E. Hampden. In the summer of 1915, Lieutenants Hampden, Bremner, and Anson approached John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company about developing a small high speed torpedo boat, and this effort eventually led to the Coastal Motor Boat which first went into service in April 1916.\nMeanwhile, in August 1915, the General Board of the United States Navy approved the purchase of a single experimental small torpedo boat that could be transportable. This contract for C-250 ended up going to Greenport Basin and Construction Company. When it was delivered and tested in the summer of 1917, it was not deemed a success, so a second boat (C-378) of the sea sled design was ordered from Hickman in either late 1917 or early 1918 (conflicting dates). Using his previous design from September 1914 and the previous unsuccessful bid for C-250, the C-378 was completed and fully tested just in time to be cancelled as a result of the Armistice. With a full loaded weight of , C-378 made a top speed of with , and maintained an average speed of in a winter northeaster storm with seas, which would still be considered exceptional even 100 years later.\nThe sea sled did not surface again as a torpedo boat topic until 1939 but continued to be used by both the Army and Navy as rescue boats and seaplane tenders during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1922, the US Navy reconsidered using small internal combustion engine powered torpedo boats. As a result, two types\u2014 and \u2014of British Royal Navy Coastal Motor Boats were obtained for testing. The larger boat was used for experiments until 1930. In 1938, the US Navy renewed their investigation into the concept by requesting competitive bids for several different types of motor torpedo boats but excluded Hickman's sea sled. This competition led to eight prototype boats built to compete in two different classes. The first class was for boats, and the second class was for boats. The resulting PT boat designs were the product of a small cadre of respected naval architects and the Navy.\nDesign competition.\nOn 11 July 1938 the Navy solicited design proposals for four separate types of boat: a 165-foot subchaser, a 110-foot subchaser, a 70-foot motor torpedo boat, and a 54-foot motor torpedo boat.\nThe winning design proposals would each receive a prize of $15,000 with $1,500 for designs that reached the final part of the competition each to be given out on 30 March 1939.\nThe larger boat proposal required vessels not to exceed 80 feet in length and to carry at least two 21-inch torpedoes, four depth charges, and two .50-cal machine guns. The performance specification was to achieve 40 knots with an operating radius of 275 miles at top speed (550 miles at cruising speed). The smaller boat proposal required craft to weigh no more than 20 tons so that they could be easily transported by larger cargo ships. Top speed was also to be 40 knots, but specified operating radius was to be 120 miles at top speed and 240 miles at cruising speed. Armament for the smaller boats was to be either two torpedoes and two depth charges, or .50-cal machine guns and a smokescreen generator.\nBy September 1938 the U.S. Navy had received 24 design proposals for the small boat and 13 design proposals for the larger 70-footer. Of those proposals submitted, three 54-ft designs and five 70-ft designs were of interest, and the designers were asked to submit more detailed plans for both the 54 and 70 foot boats by no later than 7 November. On 21 March 1939 Sparkman &amp; Stephens won the prize in the 70-foot class, and George Crouch (for Henry B. Nevins, Inc.) had won the design proposal for the 54-foot class. After winning the design competition for the smaller PT boat, Crouch wrote that Hickman's sea sled design would be far superior \"in either rough or smooth water to that of the best possible V-bottom or hard chine design\". Earlier when sea sleds were specifically excluded, Crouch had informed the Bureau of Ships that the sea sled was the best type of vessel for the job.\nFollowing the competition, contracts were placed for construction of boats: 25 May 1939 to Higgins Industries for two boats (PT5 and PT6) of the Sparkman &amp; Stephens design, scaled up to an overall length of 81 feet; 8 June 1939 to Miami Shipbuilding (PT-1 and PT-2) and Fisher Boatworks (PT-3 and PT-4) for the Crouch design; to the Philadelphia Navy Yard (PT-7, PT-8) for 81-foot boats designed by the Bureau of Ships. These last two boats were constructed mainly out of aluminum and had 4 engines. Higgins built an additional \"PT-6 \"Prime\"\" redesigned by Andrew Higgins personally using his own methods. Later that same year, Higgins built \"PT-70\" (at their own expense) that incorporated slight improvements over \"PT-6 Prime\".\nLater, testing revealed shortcomings that had to be fixed before the designs could meet performance specifications. As a result, the Navy ordered further investigation and refinement of the existing designs until a satisfactory working design could be obtained. At the same time, Henry R. Sutphen of Electric Launch Company (Elco) and his designers (Irwin Chase, Bill Fleming, and Glenville Tremaine) visited the United Kingdom in February 1939 at the Navy's request to see British motor torpedo boat designs with a view to obtaining one that could be used as a check on the Navy's efforts. While visiting the British Power Boat Company, they purchased a private venture motor torpedo boat (MTB) design\u2014PV70, later renamed \"PT-9\u2014\"designed by the power boat racer Hubert Scott-Paine. \"PT-9\" was to serve as the prototype for all the early Elco PT boats. After the initial competition, in late 1939 the Navy contracted Elco to build 11 copies of \"PT-9\".\nOn 11 October 1940 an agreement between the Navy and Huckins Yacht Corporation was finalized. The Navy would provide engines and Huckins would build a PT boat at their own expense, with the caveat that the boat (upon completion) would be offered to the Navy for a later sum. This boat (designated MT-72) later became \"PT-69\". Huckins reported a profit of $28.60 on this transaction.\nPlywood Derby.\nBackground.\nIn March 1941, during a heavy weather run from Key West to New York by Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 2 (MTBRON\u00a02), Elco 70-footers pounded heavily in waves even at moderate speeds, and seas continuously broke high over the bows. Operating personnel reported extreme discomfort and fatigue. All boats suffered from some sort of structural failure: forward chine guards ripped away, bottom framing under bows broken, side planking cracked [indicating lack of longitudinal strength], and other weaknesses were reported. In April MTBRON\u00a01 reported enthusiasm over the 81-foot Higgins (\"PT-6\"), and with the \"PT-6\" showing such good seakeeping, further purchase of Scott-Paine boats was unnecessary. In early 1941 the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships lent Packard engines to both Huckins and Higgins, which wanted to build competitive boats at their own expense.\nA Chief of Naval Operations PT Boat Conference convened in May 1941 to discuss future PT characteristics. All PTs prior to the Elcos had been found defective, and it was probable the extended Elco would not be an improvement. The conference recommended a series of comparative tests to evaluate what turned out to be five new designs of motor torpedo boats. The conference strongly recommended that no more Elco 77-footers be ordered until the tests had shown that they were indeed satisfactory.\nBoard of Inspection and Survey.\nThe Board of Inspection and Survey, headed by Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox Jr., conducted comparative service tests off New London, Connecticut, from 21 to 24 July 1941, using the following boats:\nEach member of the board conducted an independent inspection of every boat class, evaluating them for structural sufficiency, habitability, access, arrangement for attack control, and communication facilities. Boats were also evaluated under two conditions of armament loading: loaded and fully equipped with four torpedoes and sufficient fuel to operate 500 NM at 20 knots; and fully loaded with two torpedoes and ten depth charges with sufficient fuel to operate at . Boats would have their tactical parameters of each design determined by photographs from an airship.\nFirst open-ocean trial.\nLastly, there was a demonstration of seakeeping qualities and hull strength by making a run at maximum sustained speed in the open ocean. An accelerometer was installed in the pilot house of each boat to record \"pounding\". Conducted on 24 July 1941, this open-water trial, at full throttle, was referred to by PT personnel as the \"Plywood Derby\". The course started from the mouth of New London Harbor, to Sarah Ledge, then led around the eastern end of Block Island, then around Fire Island Lightship, finishing at Montauk Point Whistling Buoy.\nAt the time, only the Elco 77-footers were loaded with armament. The other competitors had copper ingots added topside (mostly in the turrets) to make up the difference. This resulted in severe conditions for several of the boats during the trial and accounted for the transverse failure in \"PT-70\"'s deck and subsequent hull failure as the copper fell into the hull. Nine boats participated in the trial. Six boats completed the trial, while three withdrew: \"PT-33\" suffered structural damage off Block Island; \"PT-70\" was damaged by loose copper ingots; and \"MRB\" developed engine trouble at the start of the run.\nBy class, \"PT-20\", an Elco 77-footer, came in first with an average speed of ; followed by \"PT-31\", with an average speed of ; \"PT-69\", the Huckins boat, was third with an average speed of ; \"PT-6\", the Higgins 81-footer, with an average speed of was fifth; and \"PT-8\", the Philadelphia Navy Yard boat, was last, at . The other two Elco boats, \"PT-30\" and \"PT 23\" (standby boat), followed \"PT-31\", placing before \"PT-69\".\nThe accelerometers ranked the boats as follows: first was the Philadelphia Navy Yard \"PT-8\" with the least pounding, second was the Huckins \"PT-69\", third was the Higgins \"PT-6\", and last were the Elco 77-footers.\nSecond open-ocean trial.\nBecause of the problem with ingot loading, a trial with the PTs fully fitted out was conducted on 12 August 1941. Four boats\u2014\"PT-8\", \"PT-69\", \"PT-70\", and MRB\u2014returned and Elco sent two new boats, \"PT-21\" and \"PT-29\". During this trial, boats faced heavier seas, as high as . All except the Huckins (\"PT-69\") completed the run. The Huckins withdrew because of a bilge stringer failure. The Higgins 76-footer (\"PT-70\") completed the entire run but also suffered structural failures: attachments between planking and web frames pulled loose and deck fastenings near engine hatches showed extensive failures. \"PT-21\" suffered minor cracks in the deck in the same location, but not to the same extent, as previously observed in \"PT-26\", \"PT-30\", and \"PT-33\". \"PT-29\" was assigned as a pace boat with \"PT-8\" in order to generate a pounding comparison.\nThe average speed results from the course were: Elco 77-footer (\"PT-21\"), ; Higgins 76-footer (\"PT-70\"), ; Higgins MRB and Philadelphia Navy Yard boat (\"PT-8\"), . Accelerometers were again installed in the pilot house of each boat, but the readings were incomplete because the violent motion of the boats made observations difficult and in some cases necessitated abandonment of the observing stations. Further, many of those taken were beyond the normal range of the instruments and were considered inaccurate. Elco boats were found to pound heavily and confirmed previous reports of crew discomfort.\nFindings.\nThe Elco 77-Footer Design Demonstrates:\nThe Huckins 72-Foot Design Demonstrates:\nThe Navy Yard Philadelphia 81-Foot Design Demonstrates:\nThe Higgins 81-Foot Design Demonstrates:\nThe Higgins 76-Foot Design Demonstrates:\nThe board arrived at the following recommendations:\nThe board also had the following opinion on structural sufficiency: \"During the first series of tests (21\u201324 July) the Huckins design (PT-69), the Philadelphia design (PT-8) and the Higgins design (PT-6) completed the open sea endurance run without structural damage. The Higgins 70' (British) boat did not complete this run because of engine trouble. The Higgins 76' (PT-70) and boats of the Elco 77' (PT-20 Class) developed structural failures even under moderate weather conditions prevailing. In the interval between the first and second test periods the PT-70 was repaired and an effort made to eliminate the causes of the structural failures. However, during the second endurance run, which was made in a very rough sea for this size boat, structural failures again occurred in PT-70. PT-69 and PT-21 experienced structural failures during the second run though these were much more localized as compared with those found on PT-70. The Board is of the opinion that certain changes in design are required to enable PT-69 and boats of the PT-20 Class to carry safely their military loads in rough weather.\"\nThe board results provided very important benchmarks in the infancy of PT boat development. This type of craft presented design challenges that were still issues decades after, but there are some significant conclusions from the above recommendations and their order of merit. Those are:\nElco.\nThe newly designed Elco Naval Division boats were the longest of the three types of PT boats built for the Navy used during World War II. By war's end, more of the Elco boats were built (326 in all) than any other type of motor torpedo boat. While comparable in size to many wooden sailing ships in history, these beam wooden-hulled craft were classified as boats in comparison with much larger steel-hulled destroyers, destroyer escorts, and corvettes. Five Elco boats were manufactured in knock-down kit form and sent to Long Beach Boatworks for assembly on the West Coast as part of an experiment and as a proof of concept.\nHiggins.\nHiggins Industries produced 199 boats of the \"PT-71\"/\"PT-235\", \"PT-265\" and \"PT-625\" classes. The Higgins boats had the same beam, full load displacement, engines, generators, shaft horsepower, trial speed, armament, and crew accommodation as the Elco boats. Many Higgins boats were sent to the Soviet Union and Great Britain at the beginning of the war, so many of the lower-numbered squadrons in the U.S. Navy were made up exclusively of Elcos. U.S. Navy PT boats were organized into MTBRONs. The first Higgins boats for the U.S. Navy were used in the battle for the Aleutian Islands (Attu and Kiska) as part of Squadrons 13 and 16, and others (MTBRON15 and MTBRON22) in the Mediterranean against the Germans. They were also used during the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944.\nEven though only half as many Higgins boats were produced, far more survive (seven hulls, three of which have been restored to their World War II configuration) than the more numerous Elco boats. Of the Elco boats, only three hulls (one restored) were known to exist as of 2016.\nHuckins Yacht Corporation.\nHuckins and his innovative Quadraconic planing hull design were latecomers to PT boat design. Not invited to participate in the original design competition, by late 1940, Huckins had a meeting with Captain James M. Irish, Chief of Design, and offered to build a \"planing seagoing hull\" PT boat, on the condition the Navy loan Huckins engines and agree to look at the Huckins boat. In early July 1941, the Navy accepted \"PT-69\".\nAfter obtaining excellent testing results at the Plywood Derby, the Navy awarded Huckins Yacht Corporation a contract in 1941 for 8 boats, and later added 10 more. The design was enlarged and modified to meet the new requirements. The first three of the new design (\"PT-95\" through \"PT-97\") were initially kept in the Jacksonville, Florida, area for testing, resulting in several important modifications to the overall design (these boats were later assigned to Squadron 4 in 1942).\nHuckins ended up building just two squadrons of PT boats during World War II. Five boats were assigned to Squadron 14 (\"PT-98\" through \"PT-102\") which was commissioned in early 1943; and ten boats assigned to Squadron 26 (PT-255 thru PT-264) which was commissioned in mid 1943. They were assigned to specific outposts in the Panama Canal Zone, Miami, Florida, the Hawaiian Sea Frontier at Pearl Harbor and Midway, and a Melville Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center.\nAlthough not used in any other PT boat design, Huckins licensed the use of his patented Quadraconic hull in his PT boat construction. He also granted permission for Elco, Higgins, and the Philadelphia Navy Yard to use his patented laminated keel, which increased hull strength, although neither Elco nor Higgins chose to use it on their boats. Most probably due to the lateness in joining the PT boat program and unlike Elco and Higgins, the Huckins yard was not provided government support to construct a larger facility prior to the war. The handcrafted Huckins PT was produced at their civilian facility at a speed of one per month. The success and ruggedness of the Huckins' 78-foot seagoing design is demonstrated by Squadron 26's constant ready-boat operations and fleet torpedo boat training in the oceans around Midway and Hawaii during the last two years of the war.\nVosper and other types of PT boats.\nVospers of Great Britain arranged for several boatyards in the United States to build British-designed motor torpedo boats under license to help the war effort. The boatyards were located in Annapolis, Bristol, City Island, Miami, and Los Angeles. 146 boats, armed with torpedoes, were built for Lend Lease, and exported to Allied powers such as Canada, Britain, Norway, and the Soviet Union. These boats were never used by the U.S. Navy, and only about 50 were used by the Royal Navy; most were passed to other countries. The Canadian Power Boat Company produced four Scott-Paine designed PTs for the U.S. These were to be provided to the Dutch forces under Lend Lease but were re-requisitioned to the USN as PT 368\u2013371 after the fall of the Netherlands to German forces.\nConstruction.\nPT boats offered accommodation for three officers and 14 enlisted men. Crews varied from 12 to 17, depending upon the number and type of weapons installed. Full-load displacement late in the war was 56 tons.\nThe hull shapes of the Elco and Higgins PT boats were similar to the contoured \"planing hull\" found in pleasure boats of the time (and still in use today): a sharp V at the bow softening to a flat bottom at the stern. A common characteristic of this type of contoured hull is the \"rooster tail\" in the wake. Unlike the actual \"planing hull\" Huckins, which planed at 10-11 knots, the Elco and Higgins PT boats were intended to plane at higher speeds (PT 71 and PT-103 classes at around 27 knots, and the PT-265 and 625 classes at around 23 knots).\nThe Elco, Higgins and Huckins companies used varying lightweight techniques of hull construction. Though often said to be made of plywood, the hulls were actually made of two diagonal layered thick mahogany planks, with a glue-impregnated or lead-painted layer of canvas in between. Holding all this together were thousands of bronze screws and copper rivets. This type of construction made it possible for damage to the wooden hulls of these boats to be easily repaired at forward operating bases by base force personnel. According to Robert McFarlane, the US Navy built the hulls of some PT boats partially from 3,000-year-old white cedar logs recovered from sphagnum bogs in New Jersey.\nAs a testament to the strength of this type of construction and watertight bulkheads, several PT boats withstood catastrophic battle damage and still remained afloat. For example, the forward half of future President John F. Kennedy's \"PT-109\" (Elco) stayed afloat for 12 hours after she was cut in half by the Japanese destroyer \"Amagiri\". \"PT-323\" (Elco) was cut in half by a \"kamikaze\" aircraft on 10 December 1944 off Leyte, yet remained floating for several hours. \"PT-308\" (Higgins) had her stern sheared off by a collision with \"PT-304\" during a night mission in the Mediterranean on 9 March 1945 and yet returned to base for repairs. \"PT-167\" (Elco) was holed through the bow off Bougainville Island on 5 November 1943 by a torpedo which failed to detonate; the boat remained in action and was repaired the next day.\nIn 1943, an inquiry was held by the Navy to discuss planing, hull design, and fuel consumption issues. This resulted in the November 1943 Miami test trial between two Higgins and two Elco boats, but no major additional modifications were made before the end of the war. During the war, Elco came up with stepped hull designs (\"ElcoPlane\") which achieved significant increase in top speed. Higgins developed the small and fast \"Higgins Hellcat\", which was a slight variation on their original hull form, but the Navy rejected them for full production because of increased fuel consumption and other considerations.\nAfter the war, Lindsay Lord, who was stationed in Hawaii during the war, recorded the Navy's planing hull research and findings in \"Naval Architecture of Planing Hulls\". It covers PT boat hull design and construction and provides hull test data as well as detailed analysis of the various PT boat designs.\nArmament.\nThe primary anti-ship armament was two to four Mark 8 torpedoes, which weighed and contained a TNT warhead. These torpedoes were launched by Mark 18 steel torpedo tubes. Mark 8 torpedoes had a range of at . These torpedoes and tubes were replaced in mid-1943 by four lightweight Mark 13 torpedoes, which weighed and contained a Torpex-filled warhead. These torpedoes were carried on lightweight Mark 1 roll-off style torpedo launching racks. The Mark 13 torpedo had a range of and a speed of .\nPT boats were also armed with numerous automatic weapons. Common to all US PT boats were the two twin M2 .50 cal (12.7\u00a0mm) machine guns. Early PT boats (Elco \"PT20\" through \"PT44\") mounted Dewandre plexiglas-enclosed hydraulically operated rotating turrets. Almost immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Dewandre turrets were replaced on the entire PT boat fleet with open-ring twin mounts. The ring mount was designed by both Elco and Bell and designated Mark 17 Twin 50 caliber aircraft mount. Part of the Mark 17 Mod 1 and Mod 2 ring mount consisted of the Bell Mark 9 twin cradle. Another automatic weapon commonly mounted on PT boats was the 20\u00a0mm Oerlikon cannon. On early series of boats, the cannon was mounted on the stern. Later in the war, several more of these 20\u00a0mm cannons were added amidships and on the forward deck.\nForward of the chart house of some early Elco boats (\"PT20\" through \"PT44\") were twin .303 cal (7.7\u00a0mm) Lewis machine guns on pedestal mounts. Beginning in mid-1943, some boats were fitted with one or two .30 cal Browning machine guns on the forward torpedo racks on pedestal mounts.\nOccasionally, some front line PT boats received \"ad hoc\" up-fits, where they mounted such weapons as 37\u00a0mm aircraft cannons, rocket launchers, or mortars. When these weapons were found to be successful, they were incorporated onto the PT boats as original armament. One such field modification was made to Kennedy's \"PT-109\", which was equipped with a single-shot Army M3 37\u00a0mm anti-tank gun that her crew had commandeered; they removed the wheels and lashed it to 2x8 timbers placed on the bow only one night before she was lost. The larger punch of the 37\u00a0mm round was desirable, but the crews looked for something that could fire faster than the single-shot Army anti-tank weapon. Their answer was found in the 37\u00a0mm Oldsmobile M4 aircraft automatic cannon cannibalized from crashed P-39 Airacobra fighter planes on Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. After having demonstrated its value on board PT boats, the M4 (and later M9) cannon was installed at the factory. The M4/M9 37\u00a0mm auto cannon had a relatively high rate of fire (125 rounds per minute) and large magazine (30 rounds). These features made it highly desirable because of the PT boat's ever-increasing requirement for increased firepower to deal effectively with the Japanese \"Daihatsu\"-class barges, which were largely immune to torpedoes because of their shallow draft. By the war's end, most PTs had these weapons.\nThe installation of larger-bore cannons culminated in the fitting of the 40\u00a0mm Bofors gun on the aft deck. Starting in mid-1943, the installation of this gun had an immediate positive effect on the firepower available from a PT boat. The Bofors cannon had a firing rate of 120 rounds per minute (using 4-round clips) and had a range of . This gun was served by a crew of 4 men and was used against aircraft as well as shore bombardment or enemy surface craft.\nGunboats.\nIn the Solomon Islands in 1943, three PT boats, \"PT-59\", \"PT-60\", and \"PT-61\", were converted into \"PT gunboats\" by stripping them of all original armament except the two twin .50 cal (12.7\u00a0mm) gun mounts, then adding two 40\u00a0mm and four twin .50 cal (12.7\u00a0mm) mounts. Lieutenant Kennedy was the first commanding officer of \"PT-59\" after its conversion. On 2 November 1943, \"PT-59\" participated in the rescue of 40 to 50 Marines during the raid on Choiseul and a foundering Landing Craft, Personnel (Ramp) (LCP(R)) which was under fire from Japanese soldiers on the beach.\nLate in the war, a new electrically powered multiple gun mounting was developed by Elco for PT boats, known as the 'Thunderbolt'. At least three different versions appear to have been built and tested; one with six .50-cal Browning M2 machine-guns and two 20\u00a0mm Oerlikon cannon, another with two .50-cal machine-guns and four 20\u00a0mm cannon and a version with just the four cannon. In mid-1944, the cannon-only version of the Thunderbolt was experimentally fitted to four operational 80\u00a0ft Elco boats which served with PTBRON 29 in the Mediterranean theatre: These were \"PT\"s \"556-559\". Photographic evidence shows that these boats landed their torpedoes and did not operate as torpedo craft when shipping the large and heavy Thunderbolt. According to Bulkley in chapter 18 of 'At Close Quarters' the multiple 20\u00a0mm mounting was anticipated to be \"of limited usefulness\" against \"well compartmented F-lighters\" where even the 40\u00a0mm Bofors struggled to inflict serious damage.\nThe weapon was trialled operationally on the nights of July 16/17 and July 18/19, when \"PT 558\" (Ens. Aalton D. Monaghan) patrolled off the Antibes area with two regular 40\u00a0mm-armed boats and on both occasions engaged small single patrol boats; both craft were sunk by the combined gunfire of the American patrol. Lt Cmdr Daunis reported that \"The Elco Thunderbolt mount has been used in two gunnery attacks and has proven to be an exceptional weapon.\"\nOther armament.\nTowards the end of the war, beginning in 1945, PTs received two eight-cell Mark 50 rocket launchers, launching spin-stabilized flat trajectory Mark 7 and/or Mark 10 rockets with a range of . These 16 rockets plus 16 reloads gave them as much firepower as a destroyer's guns broadside (albeit without their accuracy). By war's end, the PT boat had more \"firepower per ton\" than any other vessel in the U.S. Navy fleet. PT boats also commonly carried between two and eight Mark 6 depth charges in roll-off racks. A few PT boats were equipped to carry naval mines launched from mine racks, but these were not commonly used.\nEngines.\nWith the exception of the experimental PT boats, all US PT boats were powered by three marine-modified derivations of the Packard 3A-2500 V-12 liquid-cooled, gasoline-fueled aircraft engine. Improvements upon Packard's World War I Liberty L-12 2A engine, the successive \"M\" for \"marine\" designated 3M-2500, 4M-2500, and 5M-2500 generations all featured slight changes and more power. Their superchargers, intercoolers, dual magnetos, and two spark plugs per cylinder reflected their aircraft origins.\nPackard's licensed manufacture of the famed Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engine alongside the marine 4M-2500 has long been a source of confusion. Only the British-built \"PT-9\" prototype boat brought from England for Elco to examine and copy featured a Merlin. The 4M-2500 initially generated . It was subsequently upgraded in stages to , allowing a designed speed of . The 5M-2500 introduced in late 1945 had a larger supercharger, aftercooler, and increased power output of . It could push fully loaded boats at . However, subsequent additions of weaponry offset this potential increase in top speed.\nFuel consumption of any version of these engines was exceptionally heavy. A PT boat carried of 100 octane aviation fuel, enough for a 4M-2500 equipped boat to conduct a maximum 12-hour patrol. Some per hour were consumed at a cruising speed of , increasing to per hour at top speed. Hull fouling and engine wear could both decrease top speed and increase fuel consumption materially.\nService.\nPT boats operated in the southern, western, and northern Pacific, as well as in the Mediterranean Sea and the English Channel.\nEarly use.\nOriginally conceived as anti-ship weapons, PT boats were publicly credited with sinking several Japanese warships during the period between December 1941 and the fall of the Philippines in May 1942\u2014even though the Navy knew the claims were all false. The exaggerated claims by Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley, commanding officer of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three (MTBRON\u00a03), about the effectiveness of the PTs in combat against larger craft allowed him to recruit top talent, raise war bonds, and caused overconfidence among squadron commanders who continued to pit PTs against larger craft. The reality was his claims that PTs had sunk a Japanese cruiser, a troopship, and a plane tender in the Philippines were untrue.\nCompounding the difficulty with the early torpedoes, PT boat crews attacking at night may have sometimes failed to note a possible torpedo failure. Although the American Mark 8 torpedo did have problems with porpoising and circular runs, it could and did have success against common classes of targets. The Mark 3 and Mark 4 exploders were not subject to the same problems as the Mark 6 exploders on U.S. submarines' Mark 14 torpedoes. Difficulties remained in spite of Bulkeley's claim that introduction of the Mark 13 torpedo to PT boats in mid-1943 all but eliminated the early problems that PT boats had with their obsolete Mark 8s. In the August 1943 engagement in which \"PT-109\" was lost, fifteen boats shipping 60 torpedoes fired over half with no hits on an enemy vessel.\nNight attacks.\nPTs usually attacked at night. The cockpits of PT boats were protected by armor plate against small arms fire and splinters. Direct hits from Japanese guns sometimes caused catastrophic gasoline explosions with near-total crew loss. Crews feared attack by Japanese seaplanes, which were difficult to detect even with radar, but which could easily spot the phosphorescent wake left by PT propellers. Bombing attacks killed and wounded crews even with near misses. There are several recorded instances of PT boats trading fire with friendly aircraft. Several PT boats, such as \"PT-346\", were lost by friendly fire from both Allied aircraft and destroyers. Enemy forces used searchlights or seaplane-dropped flares to illuminate fleeing PT boats.\nInitially, a few boats were issued primitive radar sets. U.S. Navy PTs were eventually fitted with Raytheon SO radar, which had about a range. Radar gave Navy PTs a distinct advantage in intercepting enemy supply barges and ships at night. As more PTs were fitted with dependable radar, they developed superior night-fighting tactics, allowing them to locate and destroy many enemy targets.\nDuring some of these nighttime attacks, PT boat positions may have been given away by a flash of light caused by grease inside the black powder-actuated Mark 8 torpedo tubes catching fire during the launching sequence. In order to evade return fire from the enemy ships, the PT boat could deploy a smoke screen using stern-mounted generators. Starting in mid-1943, the old Mark 18 torpedo tubes and Mark 8 torpedoes began to be replaced by the new Mark 1 roll-off torpedo launcher rack loaded with an improved Mark 13 aerial torpedo. This eliminated the telltale flash of light from burning grease, did not use any form of explosive to launch the torpedo, and weighed about less than the previous tubes.\nSolomon Islands campaign.\nThe effectiveness of PT boats in the Solomon Islands campaign, and countering \"Tokyo Express\" Japanese resupply in New Georgia Sound, was substantially undermined by defective Mark 8 torpedoes. The Japanese were cautious when operating their capital ships in areas known to have PT boats, knowing how dangerous their own Type 93 torpedoes were and assuming the Americans had equally lethal weapons.\nThe PT boats off Guadalcanal were given credit for several sinkings and successes against the Tokyo Express. In several engagements, the mere presence of PTs was sufficient to disrupt heavily escorted Japanese resupply activities at Guadalcanal. Squadrons (MTBRON) 2, 3, 5 and 6 would lie in wait to ambush targets from torpedo range, generally about . Afterwards, the PT mission in the Solomon Islands was deemed a success.\nD-Day invasion.\nSome PT boats served during the Battle of Normandy. During the D-Day invasion, PTs patrolled the \"Mason Line\", forming a barrier against the German S-boats attacking the Allied landing forces. They also performed lifesaving and anti-shipping mine destruction missions during the invasion.\nBarge attacks.\nPerhaps the most effective use of PTs was as \"barge busters.\" Since both the Japanese in the New Guinea area and the Germans in the Mediterranean had lost numerous resupply vessels to Allied air power during daylight hours, each attempted to resupply their troop concentrations by using shallow draft barges at night in very shallow waters. The shallow depth meant Allied destroyers were unable to follow them, and the barges could be protected by an umbrella of shore batteries.\nThe efficacy of the PT boats at sinking the Japanese supply barges was considered a key reason that the Japanese had severe food, ammunition, and replacement problems during the New Guinea and Solomon Island campaigns, and made the PT boats prime targets for enemy aircraft. The use of PT boat torpedoes was ineffective against these sometimes heavily armed barges, since the minimum depth setting of the torpedo was about 10 feet (3 m) and the barges drew only 5 feet (1.5 m). To accomplish the task, PTs in the Mediterranean and the Pacific (and Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy motor torpedo boats in the Mediterranean) installed more and heavier guns which were able to sink the barges.\nAlthough their primary mission continued to be attack on surface ships and craft, PT boats were also used effectively to lay mines and smoke screens, coordinate in air-sea rescue operations, rescue shipwreck survivors, destroy Japanese suicide boats, destroy floating mines, and carry out intelligence or raider operations.\nRepair training.\nIn 1944, several Higgins boats (\"PT222\", \"PT-283\", \"PT-284\", \"PT-285\", and \"PT-282\") were converted, releasing \"PT-59\", \"PT-60\", and \"PT-61\" for transfer back home to the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island, for use in training in hull repair techniques.\nBoats.\nMany PT boats became famous during and after World War II:\nLosses.\nAccording to the book \"At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy,\" 99 of the 531 PT boats that served during World War II were lost to various causes.\nSurviving boats.\nAt the end of the war, almost all surviving U.S. PT boats were disposed of shortly after V-J Day. Hundreds of boats were stripped of all useful equipment and then dragged up on the beach and burned. This was done to minimize the amount of upkeep the Navy would have to do, since wooden boats require much continuous maintenance, and they were not considered worth the effort. The boats also used a lot of high octane fuel for their size, making them too expensive to operate for a peacetime Navy. Much of this destruction (121 boats) occurred at PT Base 17 on Samar, Philippines, near Bobon Point.\nProduction boats.\nA few (one 80' Elco, one 72' Vosper, and three 78' Higgins) were cut up and destroyed between 1998 and 2008, leaving (a known) total of 12 PT boats, and 2 experimental PT boat hulls in various states of repair, surviving today in the U.S.:\n\"PT-48\" is possibly the last surviving Elco PT boat. In July 1942, \"PT-48\" (nicknamed \"Prep Tom\" and \"Deuce\") was assigned to MTBRON\u00a03(2). This second Squadron 3 was the first to arrive in the Solomons and saw heavy engagement with the \"Tokyo Express\". \"PT-48\" was one of the first 4 boats to arrive at Tulagi on 12 October 1942. On the night of 13/14 October 1942, \"PT-48\" engaged a Japanese destroyer at . \"PT-48\" is today in need of major restoration, after having been cut down to and used as a dinner cruise boat. Because of this boat's extensive combat history, having survived 22 months in the combat zone at Guadalcanal (more time in combat than any other surviving PT boat), a preservation group, \"Fleet Obsolete\" of Kingston, New York, acquired and transported it to Rondout Creek in 2009 for eventual repair.\nOne of two fully restored and operational PT boats and the only combat veteran of the two, \"PT-305\" (\"Half Hitch\", \"Barfly\", \"USS Sudden Jerk\") is a Higgins boat, assigned during the war to MTBRON-22, and saw action against the Germans in the Mediterranean Sea. Squadron 22 was operating with the British Royal Navy Coastal Forces, and saw action along the northwest coast of Italy and southern coast of France. In June 1945 the squadron was shipped to the U.S. for refitting and transfer to the Pacific, but the war ended while still in New York. \"PT-305\" was cut down to for use as an oyster seed boat in Crisfield, Maryland. \"PT-305\" was acquired by the Defenders of America Naval Museum (DOANM), and then sold in May 2007 to the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. After a lengthy restoration \"PT-305\" has been restored to a seaworthy, operational vessel. It was relaunched in March 2017.\nA Higgins, \"PT-309\" (\"Oh Frankie!\") was assigned during the war to MTBRON 22 and saw action against the Germans in the Mediterranean Sea. The squadron was operating under the British Coastal Forces and saw action along the northwest coast of Italy and southern coast of France. In April 1945 the squadron was shipped to the U.S. for refitting and transfer to the Pacific, but the war ended while still in New York. \"PT-309\" was named in honor of Frank Sinatra, who the boat's commanding officer met at a nightclub shortly before MTBRON 22 left New York for the Mediterranean Theatre. \"PT-309\" is located at the National Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas, and was restored by the Defenders of America Naval Museum. \"PT-309\" is restored (but non-operational) in a static diorama display without engines installed. Her external restoration was completed in 2002.\n\"PT-459\" (\"Mahogany Menace\") a Higgins boat, was assigned to MTBRON 30 on 15 February 1944. MTBRON\u00a030 saw action in the English Channel as part of the Invasion of Normandy. In late June 1945 the squadron was shipped to the U.S. for refitting and transfer to the Pacific, but the war ended while still in New York. After the war, she was cut down to and highly modified into a sightseeing boat and fishing trawler. She was acquired by Fleet Obsolete in June 2008 and moved to Kingston, New York, for possible restoration.\n\"PT-486\", an Elco boat, was placed in service on 2 December 1943. It was used in the training squadron MTBRON\u00a04 in Melville, Rhode Island, during World War II until it was placed out of service 16 January 1946. In 1952 it was used as an excursion vessel from Otten's Harbor in Wildwood, New Jersey. The boat was renamed \"Big Blue\" and used until 2002. It is currently owned by Fleet Obsolete, with plans for possible restoration.\n\"PT-615\", an Elco originally assigned to MTBRON 42, was commissioned after the war ended. \"PT-615\" was returned to Elco after being sold and was heavily modified into a yacht, which was leased to actor Clark Gable. He named the boat \"Tarbaby VI\" and used her through the 1950s. The boat was serviced and stored by Elco. She was sold several times, and moved to Kingston, New York for possible restoration.\n\"PT-617\" is an Elco boat located at the Battleship Cove Naval Museum in Fall River, Massachusetts. She was obtained from the backwaters of Florida and moved to its current location by PT Boats Inc. Full restoration was completed in 1989. She is available for public viewing and has portions of her hull cut away to display the cramped interior of the crew's quarters.\n\"PT-657\", a Higgins boat, has been converted into a charter fishing boat. She is located in San Diego and is now named \"Malihini\".\n\"PT-658\" is a Higgins boat, and along with \"PT-305\", is one of two authentically restored and operational U.S. Navy PT boats afloat today. Relaunched after hull restoration in 2005, it is located at Pier 308, Vigor Shipyard in Portland, Oregon's Swan Island Lagoon. Maintained by an all volunteer group, it is powered by the three Packard V12 5M-2500 gas engines and includes all weapons, electronics, equipment and accessories restored to appear as they did when she went into service. \"PT-658\" was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.\n\"PT-724\", a surviving Vosper built at the Annapolis Boat yard in Maryland, has been used as a yacht and has since been acquired by the Liberty Aviation Museum to be restored back to its original Vosper configuration.\n\"PT-728\", a surviving Vosper boat built under license at the Annapolis Boat Yard in Maryland, was restored in Key West, Florida. Her deck house was reconfigured to partially resemble an Elco instead of its original Vosper 70\u00a0ft configuration. \"PT-728\" was acquired by Fleet Obsolete and moved to Kingston. There \"PT-728\" allows up to 49 tourists the chance to ride on a \"PT boat\". This boat is the only U.S. Coast Guard regulation-approved PT boat licensed to take passengers for hire, and the only surviving U.S.-built Vosper design. In spring of 2012, \"PT-728\" was acquired by the Liberty Aircraft Museum of Port Clinton, Ohio, for further restoration.\n\"PT-766\" is an Elco boat that is a private yacht (\"Finished Business\") located in Washington D.C. She represents the final class of Elco's with significant updates to the superstructure and radar and was intended for MTBRON 44 but was cancelled due to the end of the war.\n\"PT-796\" (\"Tail Ender\") is a Higgins. After the war ended PT-796 was used in the Key West/Miami area for experimental purposes. She was retired from service in the late 1950s. Shortly after her retirement from service, the \"PT-796\" was used as a float during President John F. Kennedy's inaugural parade to represent \"PT-109\", with the \"PT-109\" hull number painted on the bow, and several of \"PT-109\"'s surviving crew members manning the boat. Today, \"PT-796\" is located at the Battleship Cove Naval Museum in Fall River, Massachusetts, in a Quonset hut-style building, protected from the weather and up on blocks. The boat is owned by PT Boats, Inc., a World War II PT veterans organization headquartered in Germantown, Tennessee.\nExperimental boats.\nTwo experimental PT boats survive, \"PT-3\" (built by Fisher Boat Works) in New Jersey and \"PT-8\". \"PT-3\" was designed by George Crouch and employed lightweight planing hull construction methods. A barrel-back (which provided increased strength to the sides and deck), a unique double longitudinal planked (mahogany outer planking and Port Orford cedar inner planking) lightweight hull on bent laminated oak framing, she was the \"featherweight\" of transportable PT boat design, but was later rejected by the Navy during trials in 1941 after being deemed too short to carry 4 torpedoes, as well as being able to only launch torpedoes stern first, which was a procedure considered too dangerous by BuOrd. PT-3 and PT-8 were both part of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 1 (MTBRON 1) during the testing period. After testing was completed, PT-3 was transferred to Canada in April 1941 under lend-lease. PT-3 served with the RCAF Fleet as the RCAF Bras d'Or M413 (B119) based at Eastern Air Command in Halifax. She was transferred back to the United States in April 1945.\n\"PT-8\" (built at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard) in Louisiana was built entirely from aluminum but did not pass the speed acceptance criteria for use as a PT boat for the U.S. Navy because of its weight. She was reclassified as a harbor patrol boat (\"YP 110\") for the duration of the war. \"PT-8\" was stored in a yard for several decades in Baytown, Texas, but has since moved.\nThe two Vosper boats in England were built by Vosper, and the first is in fairly good condition at Portsmouth. The second UK built boat is in private hands, floating on a canal north of London and being used as a private residence, though it is remarkably intact in its World War II configuration.\nExported PT boats.\nTen Higgins boats were delivered in 1948 for use by the Argentine Navy during the late 1940s up until the late 1970s. All of these boats are now retired from naval use, with two still in civil use today as sightseeing boats on Mar del Plata: the \"Leonardo da Vinci\" and the \"Mar de la Plata\". The other six boats, including the \"Alakush\" and \"Ara Towwora\", are in various states of disrepair, sunk or scrapped. The \"Ara Towwora\", is in state of disrepair at Ushuaia Harbor.\nMovie stand-ins.\nThe original 1962\u201366 \"McHale's Navy\" TV series used a Vosper design \"PT-694\" Prior to starring in the television series this boat was purchased as war surplus by Howard Hughes and was used as the camera chase boat when the \"Spruce Goose\" made its only flight. The stern of the Vosper boat is visible in the footage of that event.\nIn John Ford's 1945 war film, \"They Were Expendable\", two Elcos were used during filming along with four former MTBRON 14 78-foot Huckins.\nThe 1943 film \"Crash Dive\", filmed during World War II, featured a full squadron of PT boats.\nFor the 1962 movie \"PT 109\", several USAF crash rescue boats were converted to resemble 80-foot Elcos when the few surviving boats were found to need too much work to make them seaworthy for use during the film.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53170", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53170", "title": "Submarine-launched ballistic missile", "text": "Self-propelled gravity-assisted guided weapon flying from an independent underwater craft\nA submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) is a ballistic missile capable of being launched from submarines. Modern variants usually deliver multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), each of which carries a nuclear warhead and allows a single launched missile to strike several targets. Submarine-launched ballistic missiles operate in a different way from submarine-launched cruise missiles.\nModern submarine-launched ballistic missiles are closely related to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), with ranges of over , and in many cases SLBMs and ICBMs may be part of the same family of weapons.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe first practical design of a submarine-based launch platform was developed by the Germans near the end of World War II involving a launch tube which contained a V-2 ballistic missile variant and was towed behind a submarine, known by the code-name \"Pr\u00fcfstand XII\". The war ended before it could be tested, but the engineers who had worked on it were taken to work for the United States (Operation Paperclip) and for the Soviet Union on their SLBM programs. These and other early SLBM systems required vessels to be surfaced when they fired missiles, but launch systems were adapted to allow underwater launching in the 1950\u20131960s. A converted Project 611 (Zulu-IV class) submarine launched the world's first SLBM, an R-11FM (SS-N-1 Scud-A, naval variant of the SS-1 Scud) on 16 September 1955. Five additional Project V611 and AV611 (Zulu-V class) submarines became the world's first operational ballistic missile submarines (SSBs) with two R-11FM missiles each, entering service in 1956\u201357.\nThe United States Navy initially worked on a sea-based variant of the US Army Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile, projecting four of the large, liquid-fueled missiles per submarine. Rear Admiral W. F. \"Red\" Raborn headed a Special Project Office to develop Jupiter for the Navy, beginning in late 1955. However, at the Project Nobska submarine warfare conference in 1956, physicist Edward Teller stated that a physically small one-megaton warhead could be produced for the relatively small, solid-fueled Polaris missile, and this prompted the Navy to leave the Jupiter program in December of that year. Soon Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke concentrated all Navy strategic research on Polaris, still under Admiral Raborn's Special Project Office. All US SLBMs have been solid-fueled while all Soviet and Russian SLBMs have been liquid-fueled except for the Russian RSM-56 Bulava, which entered service in 2014.\nThe world's first operational nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) was with 16 Polaris A-1 missiles, which entered service in December 1959 and conducted the first SSBN deterrent patrol November 1960 \u2013 January 1961. \"George Washington\" also conducted the first successful submerged SLBM launch with a Polaris A-1 on 20 July 1960. Fifty-two days later, the Soviet Union made its first successful underwater launch of a submarine ballistic missile in the White Sea, on 10 September 1960 from the same converted Project 611 (NATO reporting name Zulu-IV class) submarine that first launched the R-11FM. The Soviets were only a year behind the US with their first SSBN, the ill-fated \"K-19\" of Project 658 (Hotel class), commissioned in November 1960. However, the Hotel class carried only three R-13 missiles (NATO reporting name SS-N-4) each and had to surface and raise the missile to launch. Submerged launch was not an operational capability for the Soviets until 1963, when the R-21 missile (SS-N-5) was first backfitted to Project 658 (Hotel class) and Project 629 (Golf class) submarines. The Soviet Union was able to beat the US in launching and testing the first SLBM with a live nuclear warhead, an R-13 that detonated in the Novaya Zemlya Test Range in the Arctic Ocean, doing so on 20 October 1961, just ten days before the gigantic 50\u00a0Mt Tsar Bomba's detonation in the same general area. The United States eventually conducted a similar test in the Pacific Ocean on 6 May 1962, with a Polaris A-2 launched from as part of the nuclear test series Operation Dominic. The first Soviet SSBN with 16 missiles was the Project 667A (Yankee class), which first entered service in 1967 with 32 boats completed by 1974. By the time the first Yankee was commissioned the US had built 41 SSBNs, nicknamed the \"41 for Freedom\".\nDeployment and further development.\nThe short range of the early SLBMs dictated basing and deployment locations. By the late 1960s the Polaris A-3 was deployed on all US SSBNs with a range of , a great improvement on the range of Polaris A-1. The A-3 also had three warheads that landed in a pattern around a single target. The Yankee class was initially equipped with the R-27 Zyb missile (SS-N-6) with a range of . The US was much more fortunate in its basing arrangements than the Soviets. Thanks to NATO and the US possession of Guam, US SSBNs were permanently forward deployed at Advanced Refit Sites in Holy Loch, Scotland, Rota, Spain, and Guam by the middle 1960s, resulting in short transit times to patrol areas near the Soviet Union. The SSBN facilities at the Advanced Refit Sites were austere, with only a submarine tender and floating dry dock. Converted merchant ships designated T-AKs (Military Sealift Command cargo ships) were provided to ferry missiles and supplies to the sites. With two rotating crews per boat, about one-third of the total US force could be in a patrol area at any time. The Soviet bases, in Severomorsk (near Murmansk) for the Arctic-Atlantic theater in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky for the Pacific theater, required their SSBNs to make a long transit (e.g., through NATO-monitored waters in the Atlantic) to their mid-ocean patrol areas to hold the continental United States (CONUS) at risk. This resulted in only a small percentage of the Soviet force occupying patrol areas at any time, and was a great motivation for longer-range Soviet SLBMs, which would allow them to patrol close to their bases, in areas sometimes referred to as \"deep bastions\". These missiles were the R-29 Vysota series (SS-N-8, SS-N-18, SS-N-23), equipped on Projects 667B, 667BD, 667BDR, and 667BDRM (Delta-I through Delta-IV classes). The SS-N-8, with a range of , entered service on the first Delta-I boat in 1972, before the Yankee class was even completed. A total of 43 Delta-class boats of all types entered service 1972\u201390, with the SS-N-18 on the Delta III class and the R-29RM Shtil (SS-N-23) on the Delta IV class. The new missiles had increased range and eventually multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV), multiple warheads that could each hit a different target.\nPoseidon and Trident I.\nAlthough the US did not commission any new SSBNs from 1967 through 1981, it did introduce two new SLBMs. Thirty-one of the 41 original US SSBNs were built with larger diameter launch tubes with future missiles in mind. In the early 1970s the Poseidon (C-3) missile entered service, and those 31 SSBNs were backfitted with it. Poseidon offered a massive MIRV capability of up to 14 warheads per missile. Like the Soviets, the US also desired a longer-range missile that would allow SSBNs to be based in CONUS. In the late 1970s the Trident I (C-4) missile with a range of and eight MIRV warheads was backfitted to 12 of the Poseidon-equipped submarines. The SSBN facilities (primarily a submarine tender and floating dry dock) of the base at Rota, Spain were disestablished and the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia was built for the Trident I-equipped force.\nTrident and Typhoon submarines.\nBoth the United States and the Soviet Union commissioned larger SSBNs designed for new missiles in 1981. The American large SSBN was the , also called the \"Trident submarine\", with the largest SSBN armament ever of 24 missiles, initially Trident I but built with much larger tubes for the Trident II (D-5) missile, which entered service in 1990. The entire class was converted to use Trident II by the early 2000s. Trident II offered a range of over with eight larger MIRV warheads than Trident I. When commenced sea trials in 1980, two of the first ten US SSBNs had their missiles removed to comply with SALT treaty requirements; the remaining eight were converted to attack submarines (SSN) by the end of 1982. These were all in the Pacific, and the Guam SSBN base was disestablished; the first several \"Ohio\"-class boats used new Trident facilities at Naval Submarine Base Bangor, Washington. Eighteen \"Ohio\"-class boats were commissioned by 1997, four of which were converted as cruise missile submarines (SSGN) in the 2000s to comply with START I treaty requirements. The Soviet large SSBN was the Project 941 Akula, famous as the Typhoon-class (and not to be confused with the Project 971 Shchuka attack submarine, called \"Akula\" by NATO). The Typhoons were the largest submarines ever built at 48,000 tons submerged. They were armed with 20 of the new R-39 Rif (SS-N-20) missiles with a range of and 10 MIRV warheads. Six Typhoons were commissioned in 1981\u201389.\nPost-Cold War.\nNew SSBN construction terminated for over 10 years in Russia and slowed in the US with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1991. The US rapidly decommissioned its remaining 31 older SSBNs, with a few converted to other roles, and the base at Holy Loch was disestablished. Most of the former Soviet SSBN force was gradually scrapped under the provisions of the Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction agreement through 2012. By that time the Russian SSBN force stood at six Delta-IVs, three Delta-IIIs, and a lone Typhoon used as a testbed for new missiles (the R-39s unique to the Typhoons were reportedly scrapped in 2012). Upgraded missiles such as the R-29RMU Sineva (SS-N-23 Sineva) were developed for the Deltas. In 2013 the Russians commissioned the first Borei-class submarine, also called the \"Dolgorukiy\" class after the lead vessel. By 2015 two others had entered service. This class is intended to replace the aging Deltas, and carries 16 solid-fuel RSM-56 Bulava missiles, with a reported range of and six MIRV warheads. The US is building a replacement for the \"Ohio\" class; however, the first of the class wasn't laid down until October 2020.\nBallistic missile submarines have been of great strategic importance for the United States, Russia, and other nuclear powers since they entered service in the Cold War, as they can hide from reconnaissance satellites and fire their nuclear weapons with virtual impunity. This makes them immune to a first strike directed against nuclear forces, allowing each side to maintain the capability to launch a devastating retaliatory strike, even if all land-based missiles have been destroyed. This relieves each side of the necessity to adopt a launch on warning posture, with its attendant risk of accidental nuclear war. Additionally, the deployment of highly accurate missiles on ultra-quiet submarines allows an attacker to sneak up close to the enemy coast and launch a missile on a depressed trajectory (a non-optimal ballistic trajectory which trades off reduced throw-weight for a faster and lower path, effectively reducing the time between launch and impact), thus opening the possibility of a decapitation strike.\nNon-military use.\nSome former Russian SLBMs have been converted into Volna and Shtil' launch vehicles to launch satellites \u2013 either from a submarine or from a launch site on land.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Named in allusion to its predecessor, the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, the Superfortress was designed for high-altitude strategic bombing, but also excelled in low-altitude night incendiary bombing, and in dropping naval mines to blockade Japan. Silverplate B-29s dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only aircraft ever to drop nuclear weapons in combat.\nOne of the largest aircraft of World War II, the B-29 was designed with state-of-the-art technology, which included a pressurized cabin, dual-wheeled tricycle landing gear, and an analog computer-controlled fire-control system that allowed one gunner and a fire-control officer to direct four remote machine gun turrets. The $3\u00a0billion cost of design and production (equivalent to $\u00a0billion in 2024), far exceeding the $1.9\u00a0billion cost of the Manhattan Project, made the B-29 program the most expensive of the war. The B-29 remained in service in various roles throughout the 1950s, being retired in the early 1960s after 3,970 had been built. A few were also used as flying television transmitters by the Stratovision company. The Royal Air Force flew the B-29 with the service name \"Washington\" from 1950 to 1954 when the jet-powered Canberra entered service.\nThe B-29 was the progenitor of a series of Boeing-built bombers, transports, tankers, reconnaissance aircraft, and trainers. For example, the re-engined B-50 Superfortress \"Lucky Lady II\" became the first aircraft to fly around the world non-stop, during a 94-hour flight in 1949. The Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter airlifter, which was first flown in 1944, was followed in 1947 by its commercial airliner variant, the Boeing Model 377 Stratocruiser. In 1948, Boeing introduced the KB-29 tanker, followed in 1950 by the Model 377-derivative KC-97. A line of outsized-cargo variants of the Stratocruiser is the Guppy\u00a0/ Mini Guppy\u00a0/ Super Guppy, which remain in service with NASA and other operators. The Soviet Union produced 847 Tupolev Tu-4s, an unlicensed reverse-engineered copy of the B-29. Twenty-two B-29s have survived to preservation; while the majority are on static display at museums. Two airframes, \"FIFI\" and \"Doc\", still fly.\nDesign and development.\nBoeing began work on long-range bombers in 1938. Boeing's design study for the Model 334 was a pressurized derivative of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress with nosewheel undercarriage. Although the Air Corps lacked funds to pursue the design, Boeing continued development with its own funds as a private venture. In December 1939, the Air Corps issued a formal specification for a so-called \"superbomber\" that could deliver of bombs to a target away, and at a speed of . Boeing's previous private venture studies formed the starting point for its response to the Air Corps formal specification.\nOn 29 January 1940, the United States Army Air Corps issued a request to five major aircraft manufacturers to submit designs for a four-engine bomber with a range of . Boeing submitted its Model 345 on 11 May 1940, in competition with designs from Consolidated Aircraft (the Model 33, which later became the B-32), Lockheed (the Lockheed XB-30), and Douglas (the Douglas XB-31).\nDouglas and Lockheed soon abandoned work on their projects, but Boeing received an order on 24 August 1940 for two flying prototypes, which were given the designation XB-29, and an airframe for static testing. The order was revised to add a third flying aircraft on 14 December. Consolidated continued to work on its Model 33, as it was seen by the Air Corps as a backup if there were problems with Boeing's design. These designs were evaluated, and on 6 September orders were placed for two experimental models each from Boeing and Consolidated, which became the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and the Consolidated B-32 Dominator. These were known as very long range (VLR) bombers; the name \"Superfortress\" was not assigned until March 1944. On 17 May 1941, Boeing received an initial production order for 14 service test aircraft and 250 production bombers; this being increased to 500 aircraft in January 1942.\nManufacturing the B-29 was a complex task that involved four main-assembly factories. There were two Boeing operated plants at Renton, Washington (Boeing Renton Factory), and one in Wichita, Kansas (now Spirit AeroSystems), a Bell plant at Marietta, Georgia, near Atlanta (\"Bell-Atlanta\"), and a Martin plant at Bellevue, Nebraska (\"Martin-Omaha\" \u2013 Offutt Field). Thousands of subcontractors were also involved in the project. The first prototype made its maiden flight from Boeing Field, Seattle, on 21 September 1942. The combined effects of the aircraft's highly advanced design, challenging requirements, immense pressure for production, and hurried development caused setbacks. Unlike the unarmed first prototype, the second was fitted with a Sperry defensive armament system using remote-controlled gun turrets sighted by periscopes. It first flew on 30 December 1942, although the flight was terminated due to a serious engine fire.\nOn 18 February 1943, the second prototype, flying out of Boeing Field in Seattle, experienced an engine fire and crashed. The crash killed Boeing test pilot Edmund T. Allen and his 10-man crew, 20 workers at the Frye Meat Packing Plant, and a Seattle firefighter. Changes to the production craft came so often and so fast that, in early 1944, B-29s flew from the production lines directly to modification depots for extensive rebuilds to incorporate the latest changes. AAF-contracted modification centers and its own air depot system struggled to handle the scope of the requirements. Some facilities lacked hangars capable of housing the giant B-29, requiring outdoor work in freezing weather, further delaying necessary modification. By the end of 1943, although almost 100 aircraft had been delivered, only 15 were airworthy. This prompted an intervention by General Hap Arnold to resolve the problem, with production personnel being sent from the factories to the modification centers to speed availability of sufficient aircraft to equip the first bomb groups in what became known as the \"Battle of Kansas\". This resulted in 150 aircraft being modified in five weeks, between 10 March and 15 April 1944.\nThe most common cause of maintenance headaches and catastrophic failures was the engines. Although the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines later became a trustworthy workhorse in large piston-engined aircraft, early models were beset with dangerous reliability problems. This problem was not fully cured until the aircraft was fitted with the more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 \"Wasp Major\" in the B-29D/B-50 program, which arrived too late for World War II. Interim measures included cuffs placed on propeller blades to divert a greater flow of cooling air into the intakes, which had baffles installed to direct a stream of air onto the exhaust valves. Oil flow to the valves was also increased, asbestos baffles were installed around rubber push rod fittings to prevent oil loss, thorough pre-flight inspections were made to detect unseated valves, and mechanics frequently replaced the uppermost five cylinders (every 25 hours of engine time) and the entire engines (every 75 hours).\nPilots, including the present-day pilots of the Commemorative Air Force's \"Fifi\", one of the last two remaining flying B-29s, describe flight after takeoff as being an urgent struggle for airspeed (generally, flight after takeoff should consist of striving for altitude). Radial engines need airflow to keep them cool, and failure to get up to speed as soon as possible could result in an engine failure and risk of fire. One useful technique was to check the magnetos while already on takeoff roll rather than during a conventional static engine-runup before takeoff.\nThe $3\u00a0billion cost of design and production (equivalent to $\u00a0billion in 2022), far exceeding the $1.9\u00a0billion cost of the Manhattan Project, made the B-29 program the most expensive of the war. Unit cost was US$639,188 (prototype cost $3,392,396.60)\nFeatures.\nDefensive gun turret emplacements.\nIn wartime, the B-29 was capable of flight at altitudes up to , at speeds of up to (true airspeed). This was its best defense because Japanese fighters could barely reach that altitude, and few could catch the B-29 even if they did attain that altitude.\nThe General Electric Central Fire Control system on the B-29 directed four remotely controlled turrets armed with two .50 Browning M2 machine guns each. All weapons were aimed optically, with targeting computed by analog electrical instrumentation. There were five interconnected sighting stations located in the nose and tail positions and three Plexiglas blisters in the central fuselage. Five General Electric analog computers (one dedicated to each sight) increased the weapons' accuracy by compensating for factors such as airspeed, lead, gravity, temperature and humidity. The computers also allowed a single gunner to operate two or more turrets (including tail guns) simultaneously. \nThe gunner in the upper position acted as fire control officer, managing the distribution of turrets among the other gunners during combat. The tail position initially had two .50 Browning machine guns and a single M2 20 mm cannon, and had the ability to override control of the two rear turrets if a target exceeded the maximum angle of the tail weaponry. If the tail gunner or nose gunner are not using the forward or tail weaponry, control is automatically transferred to the waist gunners, who have full 360 degree targeting ability, but limited to 60 degrees of vertical targeting movement. Later aircraft had the 20\u00a0mm cannon removed, sometimes replaced by a third machine gun.\nIn early 1945, Major General Curtis Lemay, commander of XXI Bomber Command\u2014the Marianas-based B-29-equipped bombing force\u2014ordered most of the defensive armament and remote-controlled sighting equipment removed from the B-29s under his command. The affected aircraft had the same reduced defensive firepower as the nuclear weapons-delivery intended \"Silverplate\" B-29 airframes and could carry greater fuel and bomb loads as a result of the change. The lighter defensive armament was made possible by a change in mission from high-altitude, daylight bombing with high explosive bombs to low-altitude night raids using incendiary bombs. As a consequence of that requirement, Bell Atlanta (BA) produced a series of 311 B-29Bs that had turrets and sighting equipment omitted, except for the tail position, which was fitted with AN/APG-15 fire-control radar. That version could also have an improved APQ-7 \"Eagle\" bombing-through-overcast radar fitted in an airfoil-shaped radome under the fuselage. Most of those aircraft were assigned to the 315th Bomb Wing, Northwest Field, Guam.\nPressurization.\nThe crew would enjoy, for the first time in a bomber, full-pressurization comfort. This first-ever cabin pressure system for an Allied production bomber was developed for the B-29 by Garrett AiResearch. Both the forward and rear crew compartments were to be pressurized, but the designers had to decide whether to have bomb bays that were not pressurized or a fully pressurized fuselage that would have to be de-pressurized prior to opening the bomb bay doors. The solution was to have bomb bays that were not pressurized and a long tunnel joining the forward and rear crew compartments. Crews could use the tunnel if necessary to crawl from one pressurized compartment to the other.\nOperational history.\nWorld War II.\nIn September 1941, the United States Army Air Forces' (AAF) plans for war against Germany and Japan proposed basing the B-29 in Egypt for operations against Germany, as British airbases were likely to be overcrowded. Air Force planning throughout 1942 and early 1943 continued to have the B-29 deployed initially against Germany, transferring to the Pacific only after the end of the war in Europe. By the end of 1943, plans had changed, partly due to production delays, and the B-29 was dedicated to the Pacific Theater. A new plan implemented at the direction of President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a promise to China, called Operation Matterhorn, deployed the B-29 units to attack Japan from four forward bases in southern China, with five main bases in India, and to attack other targets in the region from China and India as needed. The Chengdu region was eventually chosen over the Guilin region to avoid having to raise, equip, and train 50 Chinese divisions to protect the advanced bases from Japanese ground attack. The XX Bomber Command, initially intended to be two combat wings of four groups each, was reduced to a single wing of four groups because of the lack of availability of aircraft, automatically limiting the effectiveness of any attacks from China.\nThis was an extremely costly scheme, as there was no overland connection available between India and China, and all supplies had to be flown over the Himalayas, either by transport aircraft or by B-29s themselves, with some aircraft being stripped of armor and guns and used to deliver fuel. B-29s started to arrive in India in early April 1944. The first B-29 flight to airfields in China (over the Himalayas, or \"The Hump\") took place on 24 April 1944. The first B-29 combat mission was flown on 5 June 1944, with 77 out of 98 B-29s launched from India bombing the railroad shops in Bangkok and elsewhere in Thailand. Five B-29s were lost during the mission, none to hostile fire.\nForward base in China.\nOn 5 June 1944, B-29s raided Bangkok, in what is reported as a test before being deployed against the Japanese home islands. Sources do not report from where they launched and vary as to the numbers involved\u201477, 98, and 114 being claimed. Targets were Bangkok's Memorial Bridge and a major power plant. Bombs fell over two kilometers away, damaged no civilian structures, but destroyed some tram lines, and destroyed both a Japanese military hospital and the Japanese secret police headquarters. On 15 June 1944, 68 B-29s took off from bases around Chengdu, 47 B-29s bombed the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. This was the first attack on Japanese islands since the Doolittle raid in April 1942. The first B-29 combat losses occurred during this raid, with one B-29 destroyed on the ground by Japanese fighters after an emergency landing in China, one lost to anti-aircraft fire over Yawata, and another, the \"Stockett's Rocket\" (after Capt. Marvin M. Stockett, aircraft commander) B-29-1-BW 42-6261, disappeared after takeoff from Chakulia, India, over the Himalayas (12 KIA, 11 crew and one passenger). This raid, which did little damage to the target, with only one bomb striking the target factory complex, nearly exhausted fuel stocks at the Chengdu B-29 bases, resulting in a slow-down of operations until the fuel stockpiles could be replenished. Starting in July, the raids against Japan from Chinese airfields continued at relatively low intensity. Japan was bombed on:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nB-29s were withdrawn from airfields in China by the end of January 1945. Throughout the prior period, B-29 raids were also launched from China and India against many other targets throughout Southeast Asia, including a series of raids on Singapore and Thailand. On 2 November 1944, 55 B-29s raided Bangkok's Bang Sue marshaling yards. Seven RTAF Nakajima Ki-43 \"Hayabusa\"s from Foong Bin (Air Group) 16 and 14 IJAAF Ki-43s attempted to intercept. RTAF Flt Lt Therdsak Worrasap attacked a B-29, damaging it, but was shot down by return fire. One B-29 was lost, possibly the one damaged by Flt Lt Therdsak. On 14 April 1945, a second B-29 raid on Bangkok destroyed two key power plants and was the last major attack conducted against Thai targets. The B-29 effort was gradually shifted to the new bases in the Mariana Islands in the Central Pacific, with the last B-29 combat mission from India flown on 29 March 1945.\nNew Mariana Islands air bases.\nIn addition to the logistical problems associated with operations from China, the B-29 could reach only a limited part of Japan while flying from Chinese bases. The solution to this problem was to capture the Mariana Islands, which would bring targets such as Tokyo, about north of the Marianas within range of B-29 attacks. The Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed in December 1943 to seize the Marianas.\nUS forces invaded Saipan on 15 June 1944. Despite a Japanese naval counterattack which led to the Battle of the Philippine Sea and heavy fighting on land, Saipan was secured by 9 July. Operations followed against Guam and Tinian, with all three islands secured by August.\nNaval construction battalions (Seabees) began at once to construct air bases suitable for the B-29, commencing even before the end of ground fighting. In all, five major airfields were built: two on the flat island of Tinian, one on Saipan, and two on Guam. Each was large enough to eventually accommodate a bomb wing consisting of four bomb groups, giving a total of 180 B-29s per airfield. These bases could be supplied by ship and, unlike the bases in China, were not vulnerable to attack by Japanese ground forces.\nThe bases became the launch sites for the large B-29 raids against Japan in the final year of the war. The first B-29 arrived on Saipan on 12 October 1944, and the first combat mission was launched from there on 28 October 1944, with 14 B-29s attacking the Truk atoll. The 73rd Bomb Wing launched the first mission against Japan from bases in the Marianas, on 24 November 1944, sending 111 B-29s to attack Tokyo. For this first attack on the Japanese capital since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942, 73rd Bomb Wing wing commander Brigadier General Emmett O'Donnell Jr. acted as mission command pilot in B-29 \"Dauntless Dotty\".\nThe campaign of incendiary raids started with the bombardment of Kobe on 4 February 1945, then peaked early with the most destructive bombing raid in history (even when the later \"Silverplate\"-flown nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are considered) on the night of 9\u201310 March 1945 on Tokyo. From then on, the raids intensified, being launched regularly until the end of the war. The attacks succeeded in devastating most large Japanese cities (with the exception of Kyoto and four that were reserved for nuclear attacks), and gravely damaged Japan's war industries. Although less publicly appreciated, the mining of Japanese ports and shipping routes (Operation Starvation) carried out by B-29s from April 1945 reduced Japan's ability to support its population and move its troops.\nNuclear weapons.\nThe most famous B-29s were the Silverplate series, being extensively modified to carry nuclear weapons. Early consideration was given to using the British Lancaster as a nuclear bomber, as this would require less modification. However, the superior range and high-altitude performance of the B-29 made it a much better choice, and after the B-29 began to be modified in November 1943 for carrying the atomic bomb, the suggestion for using the Lancaster never came up again.\nThe most significant modification was the enlargement of the bomb bay enabling each aircraft to carry either the Thinman or Fatman weapons. These Silverplate bombers differed from other B-29s then in service by having fuel injection and reversible props. Also, to make a lighter aircraft, the Silverplate B-29s were stripped of all guns, except for those on the tail. Pilot Charles Sweeney credits the reversible props for saving \"Bockscar\" after making an emergency landing on Okinawa following the Nagasaki bombing.\n\"Enola Gay\", flown by Colonel Paul Tibbets, dropped the first bomb, called Little Boy, on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. \"Enola Gay\" is fully restored and on display at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, outside Dulles Airport near Washington, D.C. \"Bockscar\", piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney, dropped the second bomb, called Fat Man, on Nagasaki three days later. \"Bockscar\" is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, called V-J Day, B-29s were used for other purposes. A number supplied POWs with food and other necessities by dropping barrels of rations on Japanese POW camps. In September 1945, a long-distance flight was undertaken for public relations purposes: Generals Barney M. Giles, Curtis LeMay, and Emmett O'Donnell Jr. piloted three specially modified B-29s from Chitose Air Base in Hokkaid\u014d to Chicago Municipal Airport, continuing to Washington, D.C., the farthest nonstop distance () to that date flown by U.S. Army Air Forces aircraft and the first-ever nonstop flight from Japan to Chicago. Two months later, Colonel Clarence S. Irvine commanded another modified B-29, \"Pacusan Dreamboat\", in a world-record-breaking long-distance flight from Guam to Washington, D.C., traveling in 35 hours, with a gross takeoff weight of . Almost a year later, in October 1946, the same B-29 flew nonstop from Oahu, Hawaii, to Cairo, Egypt, in less than 40 hours, demonstrating the possibility of routing airlines over the polar ice cap.\nB-29s in Europe and Australia.\nAlthough considered for other theaters, and briefly evaluated in the UK, the B-29 was exclusively used in World War II in the Pacific Theatre. The use of YB-29-BW \"41-36393\", the so-named \"Hobo Queen\", one of the service test aircraft flown around several British airfields in early 1944, was part of a \"disinformation\" program from its mention in an American-published German-language propaganda leaflet from Leap Year Day in 1944, meant to be circulated within the Reich, with the intent to deceive the Germans into believing that the B-29 would be deployed to Europe.\nAmerican post-war military assistance programs loaned the RAF 87 Superfortresses, to equip eight RAF Bomber Command squadrons. The aircraft was known as the Washington B.1 in RAF service and served from March 1950 until the last bombers were returned in March 1954. Deployment was restricted to long-range training for strategic attacks against the Soviet Union, which was beyond the range of the RAF's Avro Lincolns. The phase-out was occasioned by deliveries of the English Electric Canberra bombers.\nThree Washingtons modified for ELINT duties and a standard bomber version used for support by No. 192 Squadron RAF were decommissioned in 1958, being replaced by de Havilland Comet aircraft.\nTwo British Washington B.1 aircraft were transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1952. They were attached to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit and used in trials conducted on behalf of the British Ministry of Supply. Both aircraft were placed in storage in 1956 and were sold for scrap in 1957.\nSoviet Tupolev Tu-4.\nAt the end of WWII, Soviet development of modern four-engine heavy bombers lagged behind the West. The Petlyakov Pe-8\u2014the sole heavy bomber operated by the Soviet Air Forces\u2014first flew in 1936. Intended to replace the obsolete Tupolev TB-3, only 93 Pe-8s were built by the end of WWII. During 1944 and 1945, four B-29s made emergency landings in Soviet territory after bombing raids on Japanese Manchuria and Japan. In accordance with Soviet neutrality in the Pacific War, the bombers were interned by the Soviets despite American requests for their return. Rather than return the aircraft, the Soviets reverse engineered the American B-29s and used them as a pattern for the Tupolev Tu-4.\nOn 31 July 1944, \"Ramp Tramp\" (serial number 42-6256), of the United States Army Air Forces 462nd (Very Heavy) Bomb Group was diverted to Vladivostok, Russia, after an engine failed and the propeller could not be feathered. This B-29 was part of a 100-aircraft raid against the Japanese Showa steel mill in Anshan, Manchuria. On 20 August 1944, \"Cait Paomat\" (42-93829), flying from Chengdu, was damaged by anti-aircraft gunfire during a raid on the Yawata Iron Works. Due to the damage it sustained, the crew elected to divert to the Soviet Union. The aircraft crashed in the foothills of Sikhote-Alin mountain range east of Khabarovsk after the crew bailed out.\nOn 11 November 1944, during a night raid on Omura in Kyushu, Japan, the \"General H. H. Arnold Special\" (42-6365) was damaged and forced to divert to Vladivostok in the Soviet Union. The crew was interned. On 21 November 1944, \"Ding How\" (42-6358) was damaged during a raid on an aircraft factory at Omura and was also forced to divert to Vladivostok.\nThe interned crews of these four B-29s were allowed to escape into American-occupied Iran in January 1945, but none of the B-29s were returned after Stalin ordered the Tupolev OKB to examine and copy the B-29 and produce a design ready for quantity production as soon as possible.\nBecause aluminum in the USSR was supplied in different gauges from that available in the US (metric vs imperial), the entire aircraft had to be extensively re-engineered. In addition, Tupolev substituted his own favored airfoil sections for those used by Boeing, with the Soviets themselves already having their own Wright R-1820-derived 18 cylinder radial engine, the Shvetsov ASh-73 of comparable power and displacement to the B-29's Duplex Cyclone radials available to power their design. In 1947, the Soviets debuted both the Tupolev Tu-4 (NATO ASCC code named Bull), and the Tupolev Tu-70 transport variant. The Soviets used tail-gunner positions similar to the B-29 in many later bombers and transports.\nTransition to USAF.\nProduction of the B-29 was phased out after WWII, with the last example completed by Boeing's Renton factory on 28 May 1946. Many aircraft went into storage, being declared excess inventory, and were ultimately scrapped as surplus. Others remained in the active inventory and equipped the Strategic Air Command when it formed on 21 March 1946. In particular, the \"Silverplate\" modified aircraft of the 509th Composite Group remained the only aircraft capable of delivering the atomic bomb, and so the unit was involved in the Operation Crossroads series of tests, with B-29 \"Dave's Dream\" dropping a Fat Man bomb in Test \"Able\" on 1 July 1946.\nSome B-29s, fitted with filtered air sampling scoops, were used to monitor above-ground nuclear weapons testing by the US and the USSR by sampling airborne radioactive contamination. The USAF also used the aircraft for long-range weather reconnaissance (WB-29), for signals intelligence gathering (EB-29) and photographic reconnaissance (RB-29).\nKorean War and postwar service.\nThe B-29 was used in 1950\u20131953 in the Korean War. At first, the bomber was used in normal strategic day-bombing missions, although North Korea's few strategic targets and industries were quickly destroyed. More importantly, in 1950 numbers of Soviet MiG-15 jet fighters appeared over Korea, and after the loss of 28 aircraft, future B-29 raids were restricted to night missions, largely in a supply-interdiction role.\nThe B-29 dropped the VB-3 \"Razon\" (a range-controllable version of the earlier Azon guided ordnance device) and the VB-13 \"Tarzon\" MCLOS radio-controlled bombs in Korea, mostly for demolishing major bridges, like the ones across the Yalu River, and for attacks on dams. The aircraft also was used for numerous leaflet drops in North Korea, such as those for Operation Moolah.\nA Superfortress of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron flew the last B-29 mission of the war on 27 July 1953.\nOver the course of the war, B-29s flew 20,000 sorties and dropped 200,000 tonnes (220,000 tons) of bombs. B-29 gunners were credited with shooting down 27 enemy aircraft. In turn 78 B-29s were lost; 57 B-29 and reconnaissance variants were lost in action and 21 were non-combat losses.\nSoviet records show that one MiG-15 jet fighter was shot down by a B-29 during the war. This occurred on 6 December 1950, when a B-29 shot down Lieutenant N. Serikov.\nWith the arrival of the mammoth Convair B-36, the B-29 was reclassified as a medium bomber by the Air Force. The later B-50 Superfortress variant (initially designated B-29D) was able to handle auxiliary roles such as air-sea rescue, electronic intelligence gathering, air-to-air refueling, and weather reconnaissance.\nThe B-50D was replaced in its primary role during the early 1950s by the Boeing B-47 Stratojet, which in turn was replaced by the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. The final active-duty KB-50 and WB-50 variants were phased out in the mid-1960s, with the final example retired in 1965. A total of 3,970 B-29s were built.\nVariants.\nThe variants of the B-29 were outwardly similar in appearance but were built around different wing center sections that affected the wingspan dimensions. The wing of the Renton-built B-29A-BN used a different subassembly process and was a foot longer in span. The Georgia-built B-29B-BA weighed less through armament reduction. A planned C series with more reliable R-3350s was not built.\nMoreover, engine packages changed, including the type of propellers and range of the variable pitch. A notable example was the eventual 65 airframes (up to 1947's end) for the Silverplate and successor-name \"Saddletree\" specifications built for the Manhattan Project with Curtiss Electric reversible pitch propellers.\nThe Silverplate aircraft had significantly modified electronics and armament. The jammers were removed and replaced with additional AN/APR-4 radio frequency monitoring equipment, because the Atomic bombs used a modified tail radar for a radar altimeter, and the lack of delayed arming could cause unintended detonation immediately after release. This was due to the C-3A release mechanism arming the weapon immediately upon release with no delay, making it absolutely necessary to monitor the frequencies used by the radar altimeters. Targeting was accomplished using a license built version of the British H2S, designated the AN/APQ-13 in American service. This provided both guidance and targeting, as well as timing the bomb release precisely\nThe other differences came through added equipment for varied mission roles. These roles included cargo carriers (CB); rescue aircraft (SB); weather ships (WB); and trainers (TB); and aerial tankers (KB).\nSome were used for odd purposes such as flying relay television transmitters under the name of Stratovision.\nThe B-29D led progressively to the XB-44, and the family of B-50 Superfortress (which was powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360-35 Wasp Major engines).\nAnother role was as a mothership. This included being rigged for carrying the experimental parasite fighter aircraft, such as the McDonnell XF-85 Goblin and Republic F-84 Thunderjets as in flight lock on and offs. It was also used to develop the Airborne Early Warning program; it was the ancestor of various modern radar picket aircraft. A B-29 with the original Wright Duplex Cyclone powerplants was used to air-launch the Bell X-1 supersonic research rocket aircraft, as well as Cherokee rockets for the testing of ejection seats.\nSome B-29s were modified to act as testbeds for various new systems or special conditions, including fire-control systems, cold-weather operations, and various armament configurations. Several converted B-29s were used to experiment with aerial refueling and re-designated as KB-29s. Perhaps the most important tests were conducted by the XB-29G. It carried prototype jet engines in its bomb bay, and lowered them into the air stream to conduct measurements.\nSurviving aircraft.\nTwenty-two B-29s are preserved at various museums worldwide, including two flying examples; \"FIFI\", which belongs to the Commemorative Air Force, and \"Doc\", which belongs to Doc's Friends. Doc made its first flight in 60 years from Wichita, Kansas, on 17 July 2016. The public is being invited to inspect and take a short paid flight in Doc and Fifi at various venues.\nThree of the Silverplate B-29s modified to drop nuclear bombs survived. Superfortress 44-86292 \"Enola Gay\" (nose number 82), which dropped the first atomic bomb, was fully restored and placed on display at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air &amp; Space Museum near Washington Dulles International Airport in 2003. The B-29 that dropped Fat Man on Nagasaki, Superfortress 44-27297 \"Bockscar\" (nose number 77), is restored and on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, posed with a replica of the Mark 3 Fat Man nuclear bomb. The third is Superfortress 45-21748, which was delivered on 9 August 1945 and is on display at the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nOnly two of the twenty-two museum aircraft are outside the United States: \"It's Hawg Wild\" at the Imperial War Museum Duxford and another at the KAI Aerospace Museum in Sachon, South Korea.\nAccidents and incidents.\nNotable accidents and incidents involving B-29s include:\nSpecifications.\n\"Data from\" Quest for PerformanceGeneral characteristics* Crew: 11 * Aspect ratio: 11.5* Airfoil: root: Boeing 117 (22%); tip: Boeing 117 (9%)\nPerformance* Endurance: * g limits: * Roll rate: * Maximum glide ratio: * Lift-to-drag: 16.8\nArmament\nSee also.\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nRelated lists\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Boeing B-29 Superfortress| ]]\n[[Category:Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]\n[[Category:Boeing aircraft|B-29 Superfortress]]\n[[Category:Four-engined tractor aircraft]]\n[[Category:1940s United States bomber aircraft|Boeing B-29]]\n[[Category:Mid-wing aircraft]]\n[[Category:Aircraft first flown in 1942]]\n[[Category:Four-engined piston aircraft]]\n[[Category:Aircraft with retractable tricycle landing gear]]"}

The growth of hip hop as a genre has led to various adaptations of it depending on a region and language.\nMexican hip hop is different from Chicano rap. Mexican rap always has a gangster image since the 1990s (not all rappers) but their life styles are completely different from Chicanos reality. In M\u00e9xico they do not have gang life in the 1990s. Mexican rap it's considered as heavy influenced by American gangsta rappers N.W.A., Snoop Dogg, Bone Thugs N Harmony, Ice Cube, 2Pac &amp; Notorious B.I.G since their mainstream success at the time and Chicano rap which many Mexicans were identified the most since they have Mexican roots or Hispanic in general, most rappers are influenced by Cypress Hill, Kid Frost, Delinquent Habits &amp; Tha Mexakinz which many rappers started to imitate till the present.\nChicano rap is a subgenre of hip hop and tied more to Mexican American gangs and street life experiences mostly on California.\nMexican rap are not only rap malandro rappers (gangsta rappers). It includes all types of rap styles such as conscious rap, hardcore rap, rapcore, g-funk, r&amp;b, trap, boom bap, political hip hop, lo-fi, pop rap, cumbia rap, banda rap, narco rap, regional urbano, alternative hip hop and many other variations. Chicano rap is mostly gangsta rap and g-funk.\nHistory.\nThe first Mexican rap record started since 1979 by the comedian Guillermo R\u00edos aka Memo R\u00edos under his stage name MC Aplausos rapping Sugarhill Gang \"Rappers Delight\" instrumental on his adaptations \"El Cotorreo\". Memo R\u00edos was not expect that many years later Mexicans started to rap and had success, it was a coincidence and a mistake he stated himself on a video in 2023 talking about his story on how it become the first Mexican rap song in history.\nThe background of the first Mexican rap song started by what he does in his comedian shows by having topics like the daily life in M\u00e9xico, Mexican's attitude, Mexican pop culture and celebrities with their slangs and sense of humor, there was no inspiration on the hip-hop culture or any other kind.\nMemo's friend Elias Cervantes was a director of the radio station Radio Variedades along with Cervantes friends had great relationships with the radio stations, borrows the Rappers Delight record to Memo.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Why don't you put lyrics to it Memo, you rhyme, that genre is called rap, it's what you've been doing since 1972 and 1975.\nMemo was thinking too much to make his Spanish Rappers Delight version, he took three days to write his lyrics, he went to record his song on the studio Orbimex which was a small record studio that made it possible to record the first Mexican rap song ever made.\nAfter he recorded his first rap song, Memo continued to record more rap parody songs such as \"Pedro Infante Muri\u00f3\", \"Muy Delgada\" (Vanilla Ice: Ice, Ice Baby parody), \"Memotronic\" (Technotronic: This Beat is Technotronic parody), \"Cosa Loca\" (The Troggs: Wild Thing parody) and \"Mi Bella Genio\" (Dimples D: Sucker DJ (A Witch For Love) parody) in the early 1990s.\nAfter 33 years of Mexican Hip Hop, in 2023 Spotify started to make a mural based on their playlist \"50 A\u00f1os de Hip-Hop Mexicano\" in Mexico City that locates on Avenida Chapultepec 68 street on the Doctores neighborhood for celebrating 50 Years of Hip-Hop, curated by Toy Selectah by selecting the best hits from old school rap thru the new school rap. Memo R\u00edos appears on the mural that is the only one that doesn't have his music catalog on Spotify along with Control Machete, Cartel de Santa, Akwid, Alem\u00e1n, Gera MX, Santa Fe Klan, MC Davo, Snow Tha Product, Aczino, Lefty SM &amp; among others.\nThe hip-hop movement started since 1991 by groups as Sindicato del Terror (SDT) &amp; 4to Del Tren both from State of Mexico, in 1996 is the beginning of reached with the emergence of the group from Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Control Machete were the first hip hop group to make rap genre mainstream successful by promoting their music videos on MTV.\nControl Machete were the first hip hop group to earn money with music, to sign massive record deal contract such as Universal Music Group &amp; Polygram, having tours on Latin America, United States, Spain &amp; Germany &amp; having the exact rap production formula as the American hip hop industry standards. It has evolved to spanning more artists like Cartel de Santa, Dharius, Akwid, Kinto Sol, Alem\u00e1n, Gera MX, Dyablo, Aczino, and many more."}

It typically refers to the music created around 1973 to 1983, as well as any hip hop that does not adhere to contemporary styles.\nThe image, styles and sounds of old-school hip hop were exemplified by figures like Disco King Mario, DJ Hollywood, Grandmaster Flowers, Grand Wizzard Theodore, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Kool Herc, Treacherous Three, Funky Four Plus One, Kurtis Blow, The Sugarhill Gang, Melle Mel, Super-Wolf, West Street Mob, Spoonie Gee, Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee Starski, Lovebug Starski, The Cold Crush Brothers, Warp 9, T-Ski Valley, Grandmaster Caz, Doug E. Fresh, The Sequence, Jazzy Jay, Crash Crew, Rock Steady Crew, and Fab Five Freddy.\nIt is characterized by the more straightforward rapping techniques of the time and the general focus on party-related subject matter. The lyrics were usually not a very important part of old-school rap songs, but always included shoutouts to the artist's native New York City borough. Rap also emphasized the fashion of the time, whether it be Adidas, Kangol, Lee jeans, or the popular \"Sheep dog\" coats. However, there were some songs, such as Brother D's \"How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?\" and Kurtis Blow's \"Hard Times\" (both released in 1980), that explored socially relevant ideas. The release of \"The Message\" in 1982, written by Duke Bootee and Melle Mel and credited to Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five, marked the arrival of hip hop as social commentary, making it possible for future artists like Public Enemy and N.W.A to create an identity based on socially conscious themes in later years. Fun rhymes, like the \"Birthday Song\" and \"That\u2019s the Joint\" rocked the airwaves. Old-school rappers are widely respected by current hip hop artists and fans, with many claiming they have contributed to the evolution of hip hop.\nMusical characteristics and themes.\nOld-school hip hop is noted for its relatively simple rapping techniques, compared to later hip hop music. Artists such as Melle Mel would use few syllables per bar of music, with simple rhythms and a moderate tempo.\nMuch of the subject matter of old-school hip-hop centers around partying and having a good time. In the book \"How to Rap\", Immortal Technique explains how party content played a big part in old-school hip hop: \"hip-hop was born in an era of social turmoil... in the same way that slaves used to sing songs on a plantation... that's the party songs that we used to have\".\nBattle rap was also a part of the old-school hip-hop aesthetic. While discussing battle rapping, Esoteric said, \"a lot of my stuff stems from old school hip-hop, braggadocio ethic\". A famous old-school hip-hop battle occurred in December 1981, when Kool Moe Dee challenged Busy Bee Starski. Busy Bee Starski's defeat by the more complex raps of Kool Moe Dee meant that \"no longer was an MC just a crowd-pleasing comedian with a slick tongue; he was a commentator and a storyteller\". in the documentary \"Beef\", KRS-One also credits this as creating a shift in rapping.\nSci-fi/Afrofuturism was another theme introduced into hip hop. The release of \"\" in 1982 was a game-changer, like \"a light being switched on.\" The combination of electronic percussive propulsion and Afrika Bambaataa's rap sounded like \"an orchestra being rocketed into outer space.\" \"Light Years Away\", by Warp 9 (1983), produced and written by Lotti Golden and Richard Scher, explored social commentary from a sci-fi perspective. A \"cornerstone of early 80's beatbox afrofuturism\", \"Light Years Away\" is characterized as \"a brilliantly spare and sparse piece of electro hip-hop traversing inner and outer space.\"\nFreestyle rap during hip hop's old-school era was defined differently than today. Kool Moe Dee refers to this earlier definition in his book \"There's a God on the Mic\": \"There are two types of freestyle. There's an old-school freestyle that's basically rhymes that you've written that may not have anything to do with any subject or that goes all over the place. Then there's freestyle where you come off the top of the head\". This is in contrast to the more recent definition which usually defines freestyle rap as \"improvisational rap like a jazz solo\". In old-school hip hop, Kool Moe Dee says that improvisational rapping was instead called \"coming off the top of the head\".\nOld-school hip hop often sampled disco and funk tracks, such as \"Good Times\" by Chic, when performed live in the 1970s. Recorded hip hop (such as Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight\") would use a live band to do covers of the famous breaks from the 1970s block parties. However, after \"Planet Rock\", electro-funk (the electronic Roland TR-808 drum machine recreation of the original 1970s breakbeat sound from the now infamous block parties) became the staple production technique between 1982 and 1986 (the invention of the sampler later in the 80s and Eric B. &amp; Rakim's \"Eric B. Is President\" brought the original 1970s breakbeat sound back to hip hop, referred to today as the \"boom bap\" sound). The use of extended percussion breaks led to the development of mixing and scratching techniques. Scratching was pioneered by Grand Wizard Theodore in 1975, and the technique was further developed by other prominent DJs, such as Grandmaster Flash. One example is \"Adventures on the Wheels of Steel\", which was composed entirely by Flash on the turntables.\nQuincy Jones was an influential figure in hip-hop as a record producer for Mercury Records, and eventually became its vice president, which made him popular in hip-hop culture. He went on to publish \"Vibe\" magazine, which became a cornerstone in hip-hop history.\nHistory.\nOld-school hip-hop typically refers to music created around 1980; however, the term may also be applied to music before this with hip-hop styles. \"Here Comes the Judge\" (1968) by Pigmeat Markham is often referred to as \"old-school hip hop\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53183", "revid": "50083538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53183", "title": "New-school hip-hop", "text": "Movement in hip hop music\nThe new school of hip-hop was a mid-1980s movement in hip-hop music, led by artists such as Run-DMC, LL Cool J, and the Beastie Boys. Predominantly from Queens and Brooklyn, it was characterized by drum machine-led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock; rapped taunts, boasts, and socio-political commentary; and aggressive, self-assertive delivery. In song and image, its artists projected a tough, cool, street B-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with Funk and Disco, novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers, and party rhymes of artists prevalent in the early 1980s. Compared to previous artists, new-school artists crafted more cohesive LPs and shorter songs more amenable to airplay. By 1986\u201387, their releases began to establish hip-hop in the mainstream. This, along with further innovations by artists like Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Public Enemy, and Boogie Down Productions, led into the golden age of hip-hop.\nThe terms \"old school\" and \"new school\" fell into the vernacular as synonyms for \"old\" and \"new\" in hip-hop, to the confusion and occasional exasperation of writers who use the terms historically. The phrase \"Leader of the New School\", coined in hip-hop by Chuck D in 1988, and given further currency by the eponymous group Leaders of the New School (who were named by Chuck D before signing with Elektra in 1989), remains popular. It has been applied to artists ranging from Jay-Z to Lupe Fiasco.\nBackground.\nElements of new school had existed in some form in the popular culture since hip-hop's birth. The first MC's rapped over DJs swapping back and forth between two copies of the same record playing the same drum break, or playing instrumental portions or versions of a broad range of records. This part of the culture was initiated by DJ Kool Herc in 1973 using breaks from James Brown, the Incredible Bongo Band and English rock group Babe Ruth in his block parties. Brown's music\u2014\"extensive vamps\" in which his voice was \"a percussive instrument with frequent rhythmic grunts\", and \"with rhythm-section patterns ... [resembling] West African polyrhythms\"\u2014was a keynote of hip-hop's early days. By 1975, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa had taken up Kool Herc's breakbeat style of DJing, each with their own accompanying rappers. Flash was especially associated with an important break known as \"The Bells\"\u2014a cut-up of the intro to Bob James's jazz cover of Paul Simon's \"Take Me To The Mardi Gras\"\u2014while Bambaataa delighted in springing occasional rock music breaks from records like \"Mary, Mary\", \"Honky Tonk Women\", \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and Grand Funk Railroad's \"Inside Looking Out\" on unsuspecting b-boys.\nThe earliest hip-hop records replaced the DJ with a live band playing funk and disco influenced tunes, or \"interpolating\" the tunes themselves, as in \"Rapper's Delight\" (Sugar Hill, 1979) and \"King Tim III (Personality Jock)\" (Spring, 1979). It was the soft, futuristic funk closely tied to disco that ruled hip-hop's early days on record, to the exclusion of the hard James Brown beats so beloved of the first b-boys. Figures such as Flash and Bambaataa were involved in some early instances of moving the sound away from that of a live band, as in Flash's DJ track \"The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel\" (Sugar Hill, 1981), and even innovating popular new sounds and subgenres, as in the synthesizer-laden electro of Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock\" (Tommy Boy, 1982). Often though the rawer elements present in live shows did not make it past the recording studio.\nBambaataa's first records, for instance, two versions of \"Zulu Nation Throwdown\" (Winley, 1980), were recorded with just drums and rhymes. When Bambaataa heard the released records, a complete live band had been added. Something closer to his intentions can be heard on a portion of \"Death Mix\", a low-quality bootleg of a Zulu Nation night at James Monroe High School in the Bronx, released without his permission on Winley Records in 1983. Likewise on the bootleg \"Live Convention '82\" (Disco Wax, 1982), Grand Wizard Theodore cuts the first six bars of Rufus Thomas's \"Do the Funky Penguin\" together for five and a half minutes while an MC raps over the top. Grandmaster Flash's \"Superrappin'\" (Enjoy, 1979) had a pumping syncopated rhythm and The Furious Five emulating his spinbacks and needle drops and chanting that \"that Flash is on the beatbox going ...\" The beatbox itself however, a drum machine which Flash had added to his turntable set-up some time earlier, was absent on the record, the drums being produced by a live drummer.\nKool Moe Dee's verbal personal attacks on Busy Bee Starski live at Harlem World in 1982 caused a popular sensation in hip hop circles. In the same way, groups like the Cold Crush Brothers and The Force MCs were known for their routines, competitive attitude, and battle rhymes. Tapes of battles like these circulated widely, even without them becoming viable recordings. Apart from some social commentary like Melle Mel's one verse on \"Superrappin'\", Kurtis Blow's ruefully comedic \"The Breaks\" (Mercury, 1980) and a spurt of records following the success of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's \"The Message\" (Sugar Hill, 1982), the old school specialized lyrically in party rhymes.\nNotable artists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One time, in probably 1983, I was in the park in Brooklyn. I was getting beat up by about eight kids, I don't even remember why. But as it was happening, this dude was walkin' by with one of those \"big\" boom boxes. And as he's walking by, we hear [imitates the unmistakable intro drum pattern from Run-D.M.C.'s 'Sucker MCs', loudly]. They all stopped beating me, and we all just stood there, listening to this phenomenon. I could have run, but I didn't, I was just so entranced by what I heard. Then the dude with the box passed by and the kids continued to beat me up. But it didn't matter. I felt good. I knew right then that I \"had\" to get into this hip hop shit.\u2014\u200a\nDavid Toop writes of 1984 that \"pundits were writing obituaries for hip hop, a passing fad\" which \"Hollywood had mutated into an all-singing, all-dancing romance\" in movies like \"Flashdance\" and \"Breakin\"'. Against this, Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, and the label Def Jam were \"consciously hardcore\", \"a reaction against the populist trend in hip hop at the time\", and \"an explosive emergence of an underground alternative\". For Peter Shapiro, Run-DMC's 1983 two-song release \"It's Like That\"/\"Sucker M.C.'s\" \"completely changed hip-hop\" \"rendering everything that preceded it distinctly old school with one fell swoop.\" In a 47-point timeline of hip hop and its antecedents spanning 64 years, Shapiro lists this release as his 43rd point. Reviewing Toop's book in the LA Weekly, Oliver Wang of Soul Sides concurs, hailing Run-DMC as inaugurating the new school of rap.\nRun-DMC.\nRun-DMC rapped over the most sparse of musical backing tracks. In the case of \"Sucker M.C.'s\", there was a loud, Oberheim DMX drum machine, a few scratches and nothing else, while the rhymes harangued weak rappers and contrasted them to the group's success. \"It's Like That\" was an aggressively delivered message rap whose social commentary has been defined variously as \"objective fatalism\", \"frustrated and renunciatory\", and just plain \"reportage\". Run-DMC wore street clothes, tracksuits, sneakers, one even wore glasses. Their only possible concession to an image extraneous to that of kids on the street was the stylistic flourish of black fedoras atop their heads. This stood in sharp contrast to the popular artists of the time, who had variously bedecked themselves with feathers, suede boots, jerri curls, and red or even pink leather suits.\nThe group's early singles are collected on their eponymous debut (Profile, 1984), introducing rock references in \"Rock Box\", and recognized then and now as the best album of hip hop's early years. The next year, they appeared at Live Aid and released \"King of Rock\" (Profile, 1985), on which they asserted that they were \"never ever old school\". \"Raising Hell\" (Profile, 1986) was a landmark, containing quintessentially hip hop tracks like \"Peter Piper\", \"Perfection\" and \"It's Tricky\", and going platinum in the year of its release on the back of the huge crossover hit \"Walk This Way\". The group had rapped over the beat from the 1975 original in their early days, without so much as knowing the name of the band. When \"Raising Hell\"'s producer Rick Rubin heard them playing around with it in the studio, he suggested using the Aerosmith lyrics, and the collaboration between the two groups came about. The album's last track was \"Proud To Be Black\", written under the influence of Chuck D of the as-yet unrecorded Public Enemy. On \"My Adidas\" the band rapped that they \"took the beat from the street and put it on TV\".\nComments from Darryl McDaniels, aka DMC of Run-DMC, make this connection to the underground explicit: \"[T]hat's exactly what we did. We didn't really think it was pioneering, we just did what rappers did before us was doing on tapes. When a lot of the old guys, like Kool Moe Dee, the Treacherous Three, and Grandmaster Flash, got in the studio, they never put their greatness on records. Me and Run and Jay would listen ... and we'd say, 'They didn't do that shit last night in the Bronx!' ... So we said that we weren't going to be fake. We ain't gonna wear no costumes. We're gonna keep it real.\"\nWhodini.\nComing out of the fertile New York rap scene of the early 1980s, Whodini was one of the first rap groups to add a R&amp;B twist to their music, thus laying the foundation for a new genre, new jack swing. The group made its name with good-humored songs such as \"Magic's Wand\" (the first rap song accompanied by a video), \"The Haunted House of Rock\", \"Friends\", \"Five Minutes of Funk\", and \"Freaks Come Out at Night\". Live performances of the group were the first rap concerts with the participation of breakdance dancers from the group UTFO. Russell Simmons was the manager of the group in the 1980s.\nThe group released six studio albums. Fourteen of the group's singles hit the \"Billboard\" charts. Four of the group's albums were certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 1984, the group released the second album \"Escape\". The entire album was fully produced by Larry Smith. From the laid back groove titled \"Five Minutes of Funk\" to \"Friends\", a cynical story of betrayal sampled everywhere from Nas' \"If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)\" to 2Pac's \"Troublesome '96\", to harder edged singles \"Freaks Come Out at Nite\" and \"Big Mouth\".\nIn 1986, the group released a third album \"Back in Black\", fully produced by Smith. A number of songs from the album received heavy local New York airplay, such as \"Funky Beat\" and the controversial \"I'm a Ho\". \"Fugitive\" was guitar-driven funk and \"Last Night (I Had a Long Talk With...)\" was introspective. Paul Kodish, the drummer of Pendulum, was featured on the album.\nDef Jam.\nThe other production credit on \"Raising Hell\" went to Run's brother, Russell Simmons; he ran Rush Artist Management, now Rush Communications, which as well as handling Run-DMC, managed the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, Whodini and Public Enemy. Simmons also co-owned Def Jam Recordings, an important new-school label, with Rubin. Simmons rose with Def Jam to become one of the biggest moguls in rap, while Rubin claimed credit for introducing radio-friendly brevity and song structure to hip hop. Def Jam's first 12-inch release was the minimalist drum machine breakdown \"I Need A Beat\" by LL Cool J (1984). This was followed by \"I Can't Live Without My Radio\" (Def Jam, 1985), a loud, defiant declaration of public loyalty to his boom box which the \"New York Times\" in 1987 called \"quintessential rap in its directness, immediacy and assertion of self\". Both were on his debut album for Def Jam, 1985's \"Radio\" (described as \"Reduced by Rick Rubin\" in its liner notes), which also contained the minimalist and rock-influenced track \"Rock the Bells\".\nBeastie Boys.\nRubin also produced music for Beastie Boys, who sampled AC/DC on their \"Rock Hard\" EP on Def Jam in 1984 and recorded a Run-DMC outtake and a heavy metal parody on their hugely commercially successful debut album \"Licensed To Ill\" (Def Jam, 1986). In 1987, \"Raising Hell\" surpassed three million units sold, and \"Licensed to Ill\" five million. Faced with figures like these, major labels finally began buying into independent New York hip hop imprints.\nFurther development.\nBy the late 1980s, the new-school movement had given way to golden age hip-hop, characterized by diversity, quality, innovation and influence. It was associated with artists such as Public Enemy, KRS-One and his Boogie Down Productions, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Ultramagnetic MCs, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and the Jungle Brothers, known for themes of Afrocentricity and political militancy, experimental music, and eclectic sampling. This period is sometimes referred to as \"Mid-school\" or \"middle school\"; associated acts included Gang Starr, the UMC's, Main Source, Lord Finesse, EPMD, Just Ice, Stetsasonic, True Mathematics, and Mantronix.\nThe innovations of Run-DMC, MC Shan, the Beastie Boys, and LL Cool J, and New School Producers such as Larry Smith and Rick Rubin of Def Jam, were quickly surpassed by Marley Marl and his Juice Crew MCs, Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, and Eric B. &amp; Rakim. Hip-hop production became denser, and the rhymes and beats faster, as the drum machine was augmented with sampler technology. Rakim took lyrics about the art of rapping to new heights, while KRS-One and Chuck D pushed \"message rap\" towards black activism. Native Tongues artists' inclusive, sample-crowded music accompanied their positivity, Afrocentricity, and playful energy. The early-mid 1990s saw the commercial dominance of West Coast gangsta rap, particularly G-funk, while the East Coast scene became dominated by hardcore rappers like the Wu-Tang Clan and gangsta rappers such as the Notorious B.I.G.\nEndnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

France is the second largest hip-hop market in the world after the United States.\nHistory.\nBeginning of French hip hop: the 70s and 80s.\nBy 1982 and 1983, a number of hip hop radio shows had appeared on Paris radio, including \"Rapper Dapper\" (hosted by Sidney Duteil) and \"Funk \u00e0 Billy\" (hosted by DJ Dee Nasty). In November 1982 the New York City Rap Tour traveled around France and to London featuring Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmixer DST, Fab 5 Freddy, Mr Freeze and the Rock Steady Crew.\nThe first major star of French hip hop was MC Solaar. Born Claude M'Barali in Dakar, Senegal, he moved as a child to France in 1970 and lived in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges. His 1991 album, \"Qui s\u00e8me le vent r\u00e9colte le tempo\", was a major hit. The European Music Office's report on Music in Europe said that the French language was well-suited for rapping. He set many records, including being the first French hip hop recording artist to go platinum. Some artists claim that the French language hip hop style was influenced by the music of French singer Renaud.\nFollowing MC Solaar's breakthrough, two broad styles emerged within the French hip hop scene; artists such as Solaar, Dee Nasty, and Lionel D championed a more mellow, sanguine style, while more hardcore performers such as Assassin and Supr\u00eame NTM assumed a more aggressive aesthetic. Many such artists found themselves at the heart of controversies over lyrics that were seen as glorifying the murder of police officers and other crimes, similar to outcries over violent thuggish lyrics in American gangsta rap. The cases include the notorious Minist\u00e8re AMER's \"Sacrifice de poulet\", NTM's \"Police\" and later Lunatic's \"Le crime paie\".\nInfluence of American hip-hop.\nFrench hip-hop, like hip-hop in other countries, is highly influenced by American hip-hop. Columnist David Brooks wrote that \"ghetto life, at least as portrayed in rap videos, now defines for the young, poor and disaffected what it means to be oppressed. Gangsta resistance is the most compelling model for how to rebel against that oppression.\" He argued that the gangster image of American hip hop appeals to mostly young &amp; impoverished immigrant minorities in France, as a means to oppose the racism and oppression they experience. Jody Rosen counters Brooks' argument, criticizing that Brooks makes use of only a few, old samples of potential French gangsta rap that contain violent or misogynistic lyrics, and asserting that Brooks fails to accurately assess French hip hop's larger scope and discounts its potential for \"rappers of amazing skill, style, and wit.\"\nFrancophone rap was given a boost in the early 21st century by a decision of the French ministry of culture, which insisted that French-language stations play a minimum of 40 percent of French-language music during transmission.\nThis makes up one quarter of the radio's top 100, ten percent of local music production and has sold hundreds of thousands of CDs. French hip hop, however, is often criticized for imitating American hip hop style. French rapper MC Solaar agrees sarcastically, saying, \"French rap is pretty much a U.S. branch office... we copy everything, don't we? We don't even take a step back.\"\nParts of American hip-hop culture have left a mark on the culture of French hip-hop as well in terms of fashion, clothing, music videos, jewelry, sounds and other things. Hip-hop culture was imported from America, especially with the influence of New York rappers and the music that came out of New York.\nThe 1990s and 2000s.\nThrough the 1990s, the music grew to become one of the most popular genres in France; in 1997, IAM's release \"L'\u00e9cole du Micro d'Argent\" sold more than 1 million discs, with NTM moving more than 700,000 copies of their final album \"Supr\u00eame NTM\". The group went their separate ways in 2000.\nAs hip hop moved into a new millennium, French hip hop artists developed rapidly, seeing commercial success, and even some international appeal. One of the most influential French hip hop albums of all time, Cinqui\u00e8me As, was released by MC Solaar in 2001. At the same time, new artists like Sinik and Diam's began to see significant success, as well, bringing a new sound and genre of lyrical prowess to the game.\nThemes.\nThemes in French hip hop include opposition to the social order, humor and puns, as well as ethnic and cultural identity. Whereas early French hip hop was seen as mimicking American hip hop in terms of aesthetic appeal, later French rappers added their own cultural and ethnic identities to the mix. With the rise of IAM's pharaoism, or allusions to ancient Egyptian pharaohs, the French hip hop artists are seen attempting to negotiate and create a space for themselves in a social scene rife with discrimination and racist ideologies.\nFrench hip hop can be defined by two major categories or subgenres: hip-hop from the north, mainly centered around major cities like Paris and its suburbs, and hip-hop from the south which focuses around cities like Marseille. The different social climates in the regions make the two subgenres distinct from one another. Lyrics from the south tend to be more socially conscious, with content mainly focusing on the fight against discrimination. Rappers from the south of France are known to tell the 'cold reality' of life in France. In the north, however, content tends to be more straightforward, with rappers typically talking about the drug trade, gang wars, ghetto life and clashes with the police, etc.\nMany of the French hip hop artists come from the poor urban areas on the outskirts of large cities known as \"banlieues\" (\"suburbs\"). Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Nantes, Lille, Strasbourg, Rennes, Caen, Le Havre, Rouen, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Grenoble and Nice have produced various French hip hop artists. The political and social status of the minority immigrant groups living in France have a direct influence on French hip hop. \nFrench hip hop has been political in its history as well. Hip-hop in France owes its success to a strong social demand for it. Historically, France adopted a series of hostile policy against immigrant families. For example, a contentious debate is currently being fought out in the political realm as to whether or not Muslim women should be permitted to wear head scarves. Domestic policy in the period since decolonization has resulted in the development of stifling set of inequalities. Most of these political outcries and demands are coming from the younger generation. Hip-Hop remains to be a place where young people can express their needs and themselves politically and freely.\nThe protest at the heart of French hip-hop can be traced directly to the economic boom following World War II. France required manpower to sustain its newly booming industries and the governmental solution was the mass immigration of peoples from regions of past French colonial empire to fill the gaps caused by shortage in personnel. As early as 1945, \"l'Office national d'immigration\" (ONI) was formed to supervise the immigration of new workers. Newly arrived Africans were not given the same employment opportunities as their French Caribbean counterparts because they were not citizens and often Africans ended up working as civil servants and menial employees living in dilapidated housing projects. Much of the resistance to social and economic imbalances in French hip-hop relate to this historically unequal situation. This is proved by lyrics of Aktivist's song, \"Ils ont\", the extract when translated states \"Aktivist denounces intolerance to all immigrant fathers/Exploited in France since the 50s-60s/...their bodies are falling apart/And their children are still being judged according to their origins.\nRelationship with Africa and the Caribbean.\nWhen hip-hop reached the European continent in the 1980s Afrika Bambaataa was an early pioneer, and when he came to France he was overwhelmed by the great importance of African culture coming from Africa and the Caribbean.\nMany French hip hop artists express strong ties to Africa, though not overtly. Rappers from the 1980s and 90s needed to keep their references to Africa subtle for a few reasons. First, explicitly praising Africa would have been offensive to the many immigrants who fled Algeria and other North African countries because of the economic adversity they faced there, and many rappers probably had parents who had done so. Also, obvious Afrocentrism would have provided the French anti-Maghrebi extreme right with an opportunity to tell Maghrebi immigrants to return to North Africa. And finally, rising conservative Islamism in North Africa would have prevented rappers from being able to imitate their behavior in their native land.\nThe progress of rap in France is associated with the postcolonial relationships founded with former colonies of Africa and the Caribbean. Therefore, the definition of Africa according to French ideas, and the nature of racism in French society is crucial to understanding the reason for the hip hop and rap sensation in France. Rappers are overwhelmingly of African descent, and in tackling the issue of their invisibility in French society and declaring their origins, they redefine their identity and defy French notions of ethnicity and citizenship.\nSome French hip hop artists of African origin have used their music to address challenges and issues that cause poverty in African nations. The French hip hop group Bisso Na Bisso's song \"Dans la peau d'un chef\" refers to the corruption of African heads of state. Though their music and the issues they cover focus more on their home country, the Republic of the Congo, all members of Bisso Na Bisso live in France and rap in French. Although many artists that have dominated the hip hop scene in France are of African descent, themes dealing with the intimate connection between France and various African countries tend not to get much promotion on mainstream radio and even less consideration in scholarly research on the subject. While the popularity of nationally grown rap in France grew with the presence of MC Solaar, his involvement in the overall French hip hop subculture is non-existent as many consider his work to be in the traditional vein of French pop.\nSpecifically, IAM incorporates many African-related themes into its music. Their 1991 song \"Les tam-tam de l'Afrique\" was one of the first French rap hits to deal explicitly with slavery. This particular track \"focused on the plunder of Africa, the abduction of its inhabitants, the Middle Passage, and the plantation system in the Americas.\" It uses a sample from a Stevie Wonder song called \"Past Time Paradise\", which, appropriately, touches on race relations and slavery as well. Many other French hip hop artists made similar statements through their music, by collaborating to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in France in 1998. In order to mark the anniversary of the abolition of slavery in Martinique (which is an overseas department of France in the Caribbean), on May 22, Paris's Olympia theater hosted a concert that opened with \"drummers chained together\" and featured performances from \"rappers of African descent such as Doc Gyneco, Stomy Bugsy, Arsenik, and Hamed Daye.\"\nIAM also incorporates images associated with ancient Egypt. Several group members assumed names reflective of this influence. For example, IAM member Eric Mazel goes by the name Kheops, the name of the builder of the Egyptian pyramids.\nThe African music influences in French hip hop also extend to the use of African instruments such as the Kora, balafon, and ngoni. Many of the drums played in Africa and the Caribbean music such as \"derbuka from North Africa, djembe from Senegal, gwo ka drums from Guadeloupe, b\u00e8l\u00e8 drums from Martinique and Dominica, zouk, bouyon music, etc.). The mixture of the diverse traditional African, Caribbean, and other instrumentals is what produced the French hip-hop and made it distinct.\nToday, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and it's global diaspora, especially in Belgium and France has brought about some of the largest and fastest growing French-language rap singers. Traditional Congolese music including in the local Lingala language has become popular globally including by artists with Congolese origin such as Tiakola, Dadju, Damso, and GIMS all of which have worked with Congolese singer, Fally Ipupa.\nFrench Antilles hip hop.\nThe French Antilles hip hop is a style of hip hop music originating from the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. Usually in French and Antillean creole, the French Antilles hip hop is most popular in the French Antilles and France.\nSidney Duteil (born Patrick Duteil in 1955 in Argenteuil, Val-d'Oise), better known as Sidney, is a French musician, rapper, DJ, television and radio host, and occasional actor of Guadeloupean origin. He is well known in France for his connection with the beginnings of the French hip hop scene.\nLanguage.\nAlthough hip hop in France has been greatly influenced by American hip hop culture, the lyrics remain typically in French. Other than English, other language influences are based on oral traditions such as African griots, \"talk over\" of Jamaica and the blues. French music lyrics typically feature puns, play on words and suggestive phonetic combinations. Such artists as Boby Lapointe often use alliterations, onomatopoeia and puns or double entendre lyrics. The dialect of choice for many hip hop artists in France is verlan which is based on the inverse of original French words. In some cases artists rap in several different languages on a track including Arabic, French and English. The purpose of the lyrics, no matter the language, is \"to popularize and vent the anger and frustrations of many disadvantaged and sometimes mistreated individuals, and to defend the cause of the poorest and least socially integrated segment of French society\".\nFrench hip hop stands out for its \"flowing, expressive tones of the language [that] give it a clear identity within the rap world.\" In many French rap songs, verlan is used which is a slang that twists words by reversing and recombining them. This makes it difficult for even French speaking listeners to understand what the MC is saying. Even though it is difficult at times to understand completely the lyrics that are being said rappers still get the heat for causing violence and disturbance within society because of their intense message of rebelling against the system.\nIt is said that one of the most interesting points about French rap is the idea that \"poetry and philosophy are greatly esteemed in France, and that they're even more greatly esteemed in French.\"\nDavid Brooks claims that French rap is a copy of American gangsta rap of the early 1990s. However, his position was attacked by Jody Rosen in his article which debunks Brooks's belief that the French hip hop scene is no more than a carbon copy of earlier American work.\nLike much of the hip hop from the United States, many French hip hop artists use the genre to address pressing social issues. The authors of \"Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Rai, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identity\" state that French rappers rap about \"the history of slavery, humanity's origins in Africa, Europe's destruction of African civilizations and the independence struggle led by the Front De Liberation Nationale.\" The components of their music are mostly influenced by the American rappers, but they also have their own style such as having their culture's tune in the beat. And they rap in their language and their phonetic sounds differ in time to time.\nAs France has embraced hip hop, they put a huge emphasis on the lyrics. They love to sing about love and poetry, and they also love to rap in French dialect. The French government has a mandate that 40 percent of the music played on the radio must be in French. Hip hop is a way for artists to express these feelings. More precisely, a hip hop built of French language lyrics laid on top of traditional break beats and samples.\nInfluence on pop culture.\nThe image of the \"banlieue\", comparable to what in the United States would be called one's \"hood\", has propagated itself into French pop culture in the form of clothing, accessories, attitude and of course the hip-hop music it yields. This fascination with the banlieue image has also found its way into the big screen with the movie B-13. This action/martial arts film depicts a somewhat exaggerated view of what one of the worst suburbs (which is what banlieue means, roughly translated) would be like 6 years in the future. One finds within this movie almost every iconic paradigm inherent to the gangster image in the U.S. We have a plethora of drugs and guns. We have a Don Corleone/\"Scarface\" figure who, under the influence of enough of his own product, considers himself invincible. There is, of course, a general disdain for corrupt police and politicians, and last but not least, there is the unfair imprisonment of the protagonist. The aforementioned traits contained the sub-plots of \"Menace II Society\", \"Juice\", \"Boyz n the Hood\", \"Belly\" and \"New Jack City\" among other movies considered pivotal to gangsta rap culture. The obvious parallels seen in the glorification of the banlieue and that of one's \"hood\" is not one to overlook. The commonalities in the two cultures are indicative of the fact that a.) almost every hip hop movement was bred from necessity and from rebellion. The guns, drugs and money of the hood are typically not the aftermath of an easy life but the result of a struggle whether it is as a hustler or as a gangbanger. Hip-hop provides an outlet for people in the struggle to lash out at the powers that be, and to rebel in some small way against the life they're stuck in. b.) the glorification of the banlieue also reminds us that there will always be a consumerist market of people, not in the struggle, who will take advantage of the allure of the image without totally understanding it.\nSuch as much of the rap and hip hop in the United States talks about money, women, guns, etc., rap in France is also somewhat following this path. Yet, many artists still rap about their ties to Africa, culture, and sending out important messages. However, hip hop in France is taking on the same image as hip hop in the United States. It's changed to talking about gang-banging and other illegal activities. Not only in France, but in many African countries, French hip hop is played and heard. \"The images, modes and attitudes of hip-hop and gangsta rap are so powerful they are having a hegemonic effect across the globe.\"\nBreakdancing.\nThe break-dancing scene in France is widespread, and some French B-boys are well known for taking part in competitions such as BOTY. Two of the most well-known crews from France are the Vagabonds and the Pockemon, as both of them won the BOTY.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Snead was awarded a record 94 gold medallions, for wins in PGA of America (referred to by most as the PGA) Tour events and later credited with winning a record 82 PGA Tour events tied with Tiger Woods, including seven majors. He never won the U.S. Open, though he was runner-up four times. Snead was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974.\nSnead's nicknames included \"The Slammer\", \"Slammin' Sammy Snead\", and \"The Long Ball Hitter from West Virginia\", and he was admired by many for having a \"perfect swing\", which generated many imitators. Snead was famed for his folksy image, wearing a straw hat, and making such statements as \"Keep close count of your nickels and dimes, stay away from whiskey, and never concede a putt.\" and \"There are no short hitters on the tour anymore, just long and unbelievably long.\" Fellow West Virginia Golf Hall of Fame Inductee Bill Campbell has said of Snead, \"He was the best natural player ever. He had the eye of an eagle, the grace of a leopard, and the strength of a lion.\" Gary Player once said, \"I don't think there's any question in my mind that Sam Snead had the greatest golf swing of any human being that ever lived.\" Jack Nicklaus said that Snead's swing was \"so perfect... and the most fluid motion in the game of golf\".\nBiography.\nPersonal life.\nBorn in Ashwood, Virginia, near Hot Springs, Snead began caddying at age seven at The Homestead's Old Course in Hot Springs. He worked as an assistant pro at The Homestead at 17 in 1929, then moved to the Cascades Course and turned professional in 1934. During the depression, Snead taught himself the game of golf from a set of clubs carved from tree limbs. Snead joined the PGA Tour in 1936 and achieved immediate success by winning the West Virginia Closed Pro tournament.\nIn 1936 he won two matches at the Meadow Brook Club, earning a $10,000 prize. This gave him the money he needed to start playing professionally full-time. In 1944 he became resident playing professional at The Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, and maintained ties to Hot Springs and The Homestead all of his life. During the winter, he was a resident playing pro at the Boca Raton Resort from 1956 to 1969. Each spring he returned to the Mid-Atlantic, stopping at The Masters Tournament on his way back to The Greenbrier.\nSnead served in the U.S. Navy during World War II from 1942 to 1944. He was an athletic specialist in Cmdr. Gene Tunney's program in San Diego, and was given a medical discharge for a back injury in September 1944.\nSnead appeared as himself in an episode of \"The Phil Silvers Show\", \"The Colonel Breaks Par\", in 1957.\nHis nephew, J. C. Snead, was also a successful professional golfer, winning tournaments on both the PGA Tour and the Champions Tour.\nCareer.\nIn July 1936, Snead won his first tournament, the West Virginia Closed Pro, contested at The Greenbrier's Championship Course and Old White Course. He shot rounds of 70\u201361 to rout Logan, West Virginia professional, Clem Wiechman by 16 strokes (74-73). The following month, he won the first of 17 West Virginia Open championships by beating Art Clark by five strokes at Guyan Country Club in Huntington, West Virginia.\nIn 1937, Snead's first full year on the PGA Tour, he won six events, including the Oakland Open at Claremont Country Club in California and his second West Virginia Open. In Snead's debut in the U.S. Open hosted at Oakland Hills, he finished runner-up to Ralph Guldahl (who won with 19 clubs in his bag). Snead shared the first round lead shooting 69 with fellow West Virginian Denny Shute (1936 and 1937 PGA Champion). In Snead's first of two attempts in The Open Championship, he finished tied for 11th.\nIn 1938, Snead first won the Greater Greensboro Open, the first of eight times, the Tour record for victories in a single tournament event. Snead's last win at Greensboro was in 1965, at the age of , making him the oldest player to win a PGA Tour event. Snead introduced his first book, \"Sam Snead's quick way to better golf\".\nIn 1939, Snead won three times. 1939 was the first of four times (although Snead had already come close in 1937, losing to the eventual champion who had 19 clubs in his bag) where Snead failed at crucial moments of the U.S. Open, the only major event he never won. Needing a par to win at the Philadelphia C.C., but not knowing that, since on-course scoreboards did not exist at that time, Snead posted a triple-bogey 8 on the par-5 72nd hole, taking a risky shot from a difficult lie in the fairway. Snead had been told on the 18th tee by a spectator that he needed a birdie to win. Snead ended up in fifth place, two shots behind three players who went into a playoff.\nDuring World War II, Snead was prevented from participating in 14 major championships (1940\u20131945 Open Championship, 1942\u20131945 U.S. Open, 1943\u20131945 Masters, 1943 PGA Championship), due to their cancellations. Snead served in the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1944.\nIn 1946, Snead won six times including the Open Championship at St Andrews. His expenses for playing there were more than three times his winning purse. Snead tied for sixth in the Open in 1962. Snead introduced the book, \"Sam Snead's How to play golf, and professional tips on improving your score. Also, rules of the game of golf, as approved by the United States Golf Association, and by the Royal and ancient golf club of St. Andrews\".\nAt the U.S. Open in 1947, Snead missed a putt on the final playoff hole to finish runner-up to Lew Worsham.\nSnead won three times in 1948, including his first Texas Open and fourth West Virginia Open.\nIn 1949, Snead won nine PGA events including two majors including the Masters and the PGA Championship and was awarded Golfer of the Year. For Snead, it was the third of four second-place finishes at the U.S. Open. Needing two pars to finish in a tie for the lead, Snead took three shots to hole out his ball from the fringe of the green on the 17th hole.\nIn 1950, Snead won 11 events, placing him third in that category behind Byron Nelson (18, in 1945) and Ben Hogan (13, in 1946). Snead claimed that 1950 was his \"greatest year\" winning \"eleven tournaments\" including a playoff victory over Hogan in the L.A. Open yet lost the \"Golfer of the Year\" to Hogan, who won one \"tournament\". His scoring average of 69.23 was a Vardon Trophy record that stood for 50 years.\nIn 1952, Snead won ten events including the Masters. At the Jacksonville Open, Snead forfeited rather than play an 18-hole playoff against Doug Ford after the two golfers finished in a tie at the end of regulation play. The forfeit stemmed from a ruling Snead received during the tournament's second round of play. On the 10th hole, Snead's drive landed behind an out-of-bounds stake. While Chick Harbert, who was playing with Snead, thought the ball was out of bounds, a rules official ruled differently due to the starter not telling players the stakes had been moved after the previous day's play had ended. Afterward, Snead explained why he forfeited even though Ford suggested they play sudden death for the title. \"I want to be fair about it. I don't want anyone to think I took advantage of the ruling.\" Snead set the record for most PGA wins after reaching age 40, with 17.\nIn 1953, Snead won three events. He finished runner-up to Ben Hogan at the U.S. Open (the fourth time he would finish runner-up at the U.S. Open).\nIn 1954, Snead won two events, one of which was the Masters in an 18-hole playoff over Ben Hogan.\nIn December 1959, Snead took part in a controversial match against Mason Rudolph, at the Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda. The match played under the NBC's \"World Championship Golf\" series, was a match-play event that was tied after 11 holes. On the 12th hole, Snead discovered that he had a 15th club in the bag, a violation of the Rules of Golf that limits a player to 14 clubs. The extra club in his bag, a fairway wood Snead had been experimenting with in practice, meant Rudolph had won on the 12th hole immediately, 11 and 7, after applying the penalty of a loss of hole for each hole the club was in the bag, even though he did not use it during the round. With the match legally concluded, Snead deliberately missed puts later in the program to create the legitimate result, a Rudolph win. Snead explained the match had ended up on the 11 loss of hole penalties, and said he did not disqualify himself in order not to spoil the show. This occurred shortly after the investigations into the quiz show scandals where players were given answers to questions in fixed matches. The match was broadcast in April 1960, and the sponsor canceled further participation in the series after Snead's admission he recreated the result after the match officially ended as a Rudolph win. The rule was changed for the 1964 Rules of Golf, where the penalty is capped at two holes (match play) or two strokes per hole capped at four strokes (stroke play).\nBeginning in 1960, Snead hosted television's \"Celebrity Golf\" program, emceed by Harry von Zell, competing for charity in nine-hole contests against Hollywood celebrities like Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope. Snead had appeared with Martin and Lewis in their 1953 comedy film, \"The Caddy\".\nOn February 7, 1962, at age 49, Snead won the Royal Poinciana Plaza Invitational, an LPGA Tour \"Battle of the Sexes\" tournament where he faced off against 14 LPGA pros. The low woman was Mickey Wright, herself Snead's equivalent in women's golf, with the most wins on that tour.\nHis 1962 autobiography was titled \"The Education of a Golfer.\" Snead later wrote several golf instructional books, and frequently wrote instructional columns in golf magazines.\nIn 1965, Snead became the oldest player (52 years, 10 months, and 8 days) to win on the PGA Tour (the Greater Greensboro Open).\nSnead played on seven Ryder Cup teams: 1937, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1955, and 1959. Snead was selected to the 1939 Ryder Cup team however the event was never played due to World War II. He captained the team in 1951, 1959, and 1969.\nIn 1971, he won the PGA Club Professional Championship at Pinehurst Resort.\nIn 1973, Snead became the oldest player to make a cut in a U.S. Open at age 61.\nIn 1974, at age 61, he shot a third-round 66 at the Los Angeles Open at Riviera Country Club to move into contention. A birdie at #17 in the last round moved him to within one stroke of the lead. Dave Stockton hit a miraculous fairway wood on the final hole. Snead was joint runner-up.\nHe shot a final-round 68 at the 1974 PGA Championship to finish tied for third, three strokes behind winner Lee Trevino. At age 62, it was Snead's third consecutive top-10 finish at the PGA Championship, but his last time in contention at a major.\nIn 1978, he won the first Legends of Golf event, which was the impetus for the creation, two years later, of the Senior PGA Tour, now the Champions Tour.\nIn 1979, he was the youngest PGA Tour golfer to shoot his age (67) in the second round of the 1979 Quad Cities Open. He shot under his age (66) in the final round.\nIn 1982, he teamed with Don January to shoot 27-under-par to win the rain-shortened 54-hole Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf event at Onion Creek Club \"The Birthplace of the Senior PGA Tour\" in Austin, Texas. This victory would mark victories for Snead that spanned over six decades (1930s\u20131980s) winning tour and senior tour events.\nIn 1983, at age 71, he shot a round of 60 (12-under-par) at The Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia.\nIn 1986, Snead wrote the book, \"Pigeons, Marks, Hustlers and Other Golf Bettors You Can Beat\".\nIn 1997, at age 85, he shot a round of 78 at the Old White course of The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.\nIn 1998, he received the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award, the fourth person to be so honored.\nFrom 1984 to 2002, he hit the honorary starting tee shot at the Masters Tournament. Until 1999, he was joined by Gene Sarazen, and until 2001, by Byron Nelson.\nIn 2000, Snead was ranked the third greatest golfer of all time, in \"Golf Digest\" magazine's rankings, behind only Jack Nicklaus and Ben Hogan.\nDeath.\nSnead died in Hot Springs, Virginia in 2002 following complications from a stroke, four days before his 90th birthday. He was survived by two sons: Sam Jr. of Hot Springs, and Terry, of Mountain Grove, Virginia, and a brother, Pete, of Pittsburgh, as well as two grandchildren. His wife Audrey died in 1990. His nephew J. C. Snead was also https://.\nIn popular culture.\nSnead was mentioned several times in the comic strip \"Peanuts\" at the height of his popularity during the 1950s and 1960s. As its creator and avid golfer Charles M. Schulz said in a 1971 interview: \"I was a great admirer of Sam Snead. I once watched him play a round in the St. Paul tournament when he hit every green in regulation figures \u2013 and all the par fives in two \u2013 for a truly flawless round.\"\nHe played himself in the 1951 Ben Hogan semi-autobiographical movie starring Glenn Ford and Anne Baxter called \"Follow the Sun.\"\nThere is a Sam Snead Street in San Antonio, Texas.\nThere is also a Sam Snead Dr in on the east side of El Paso, Texas.\nAwards.\nSnead was the PGA leading money winner in 1938, 1949 and 1950. He won the Vardon Trophy, for lowest scoring average, four times: 1938, 1949, 1950, and 1955. In 1949, he was PGA Golfer of the Year.\nSnead was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1973. In 1986, Snead was inducted into the Middle Atlantic PGA Hall of Fame. Snead was also inducted into the PGA of America Hall of Fame and the Helms Hall of Fame. Snead received the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. In 2009, Snead was inducted into the inaugural class of the West Virginia Golf Hall of Fame and in 2016, Snead was the unanimous top choice for inclusion in the Virginia Golf Hall of Fame's inaugural class.\nPlaying style.\nDuring his peak years, Snead was an exceptionally long driver, particularly into the wind, with very good accuracy as well. He was a superb player with the long irons. Snead was also known for a very creative short game, pioneering the use of the sand wedge for short shots from grass. As he aged, he began to experiment with different putting styles. Snead pioneered croquet-style putting in the 1960s, where he straddled the ball with one leg on each side. The United States Golf Association banned this technique in 1968 by amending the old Rule 35\u20131, since, until that time, golfers had always faced the ball when striking. Snead then went to side-saddle putting, where he crouched and angled his feet towards the hole, and held the club with a split grip. He used that style for the rest of his career.\nRecords.\nSnead holds the following records:\nSources:\nProfessional wins (143).\nPGA Tour wins (82).\nPGA Tour playoff record (12\u20136)\nSources:\nOther wins (46).\n\"Note: this list is incomplete.\"\nMajor championships.\nWins (7).\n\"Note: The PGA Championship was match play until 1958.\"1Defeated Ben Hogan in 18-hole playoff \u2013 Snead 70 (\u22122), Hogan 71 (\u22121).\nResults timeline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Win\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Top 10\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Did not play\nNT = no tournament\nWD = withdrew\nCUT = missed the half-way cut\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\nR64, R32, R16, QF, SF = Round in which player lost in PGA Championship match play\nU.S. national team appearances.\nProfessional\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53187", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53187", "title": "Italian hip-hop", "text": "Music genre\nItalian hip hop is hip hop music rapped in the Italian language and/or made by Italian artists. One of the first hip hop crews to catch the attention of the Italian mainstream was Bologna's Isola Posse All Star, then and still today produced by Sandro Orru, who had written the soundtrack to the animated Signor Rossi TV series Signor Rossi in the 1970s. The European Music Office's report on \"Music in Europe\" claimed that in general, hip hop from the south of Italy tends to be harder than that from the north.\nHistory.\n1980s.\nIn the early 1980s, hip hop spread to Italy through posse cuts, which were popular in social centers, alternative centers where several left-wing young people regularly meet, and where the extremely influential Italian hardcore punk scene was flourishing, from which the Italian posse cut movement inherited its social conscious. The first star to emerge from this scene was Jovanotti, who would rap in otherwise standard Italian pop. While Jovanotti was discovered by the famous producer Claudio Cecchetto and quickly reached fame, in the underground Radical Stuff published the first Italian hip hop street video Let's Get Dizzy, featuring lo Greco Bros in 1989. Also that year, Marko Von Schoenberg of Stone Castle Records in Italy produced Dre' n OG along with Andre Herring (now known as the King of Art) and Nathaniel Goodwin, with songs such as AK-47, Got Damn, Do Beat, and Spread Your Legs. But DRE and OG never received any payments for recordings.\nUnderground hip hop group Assalti Frontali, was founded in Rome in 1988. They are known for their left-wing politically and socially charged lyrics. \n1990s.\nIn 1991, the posse cut movement produced its first underground rap in the Italian language, with tracks such as \"Stop al panico\" by Isola Posse All Star, a track against murders and violence in the streets.\nArticolo 31, formed by J-Ax and DJ Jad: they started out as a mainly East Coast hip hop-inspired hip hop duo, rapped in two commercials (for big companies such as Fiat and Big Bubble) in 1993. The duo had always been criticized for their connection to the Italian pop music market. In 1996, as they started their performance at Venice's hip hop festival, the others rappers left the stage as a symbolic protest against them. \nLater that decade, a dissing battle started between them and the Zero Stress Crew (formed by Sangue Misto and Radical Stuff). Other important crews and rappers included Bologna's Porzione Massiccia Crew, Sangue Misto (project born from Isola Posse All Star), with their 1994 album SXM, which has influenced all subsequent Italian hip hop tracks.\nAt the end of 1999, the Milanese group Sacre Scuole, made up of Jake La Furia, Gu\u00e9 Pequeno and Dargen D'Amico, released the album \"3 MC's al cubo\".\nThe group Gemelli DiVersi was founded in 1997, it is a group which blends hip hop with vocal harmonies, and often with socially conscious lyrics. Their first single was the Pooh sampling \"Un attimo ancora\" (1998). The group had a peak of success in the 2000s, with songs such as \"Un altro ballo\" (2004), \"Vivi per un miracolo\" (2007) and their biggest hit, \"Mary\" (2003).\n2000s.\nAt the beginning of the new millennium, the Apulian rapper Caparezza achieves success with the album \"Verit\u00e0 supposte\". In 2001, the group Sottotono took part in the Sanremo Music Festival and then broke up shortly after. After the dissolution of the Articolo 31 and the abandonment of Neffa from the rap scene, there is a period of fatigue for the Italian scene that awakens with some productions: first of all we must remember \"Mi fist\" by Club Dogo, \"Fabiano detto Inoki\" by Inoki, \"Mondo Marcio\" by Mondo Marcio, and above all \"Mr. Simpatia\" by Fabri Fibra. \nAlthough the Italian hip hop scene remains firm in the underground, the record market, and headed by independent labels such as Portafoglio Lainz or Vibra Records. In 2006, several MCs manage to get a record deal with major majors: Mondo Marcio, a Milanese rapper, signs for EMI, Inoki with Warner, Fabri Fibra and Club Dogo with Universal, while Cor Veleno sign for H2O Music, being the first Italian artists to exploit digital music. Some video clips, such as that of \"Applausi per Fibra\" by Fabri Fibra, manage to reach broadcasters such as AllMusic or MTV and gain decent positions in the charts. Between 2006 and 2008, the genre expands to a wider audience, initially thanks to the album \"Solo un uomo\" by Mondo Marcio, which brought the genre to the general public in Italy, then followed by the albums \"Tradimento\" by Fabri Fibra and \"Marracash\" by Marracash, who managed to conquer the top positions in the standings.\nMeanwhile in Rome, among all the hip hop groups, the was establishing itself, created by the union of the hip hop groups Truceboys and In the Panchine. Among the main members of the group stood out: Noyz Narcos, , , Cole, Gemello, , Benassa, Duke Montana (who left the group in 2011) and Zinghero. While on the production side: Lou Chano, DJ Sano Volcano, 3FX, Fuzzy, , Rough, Giordy Beatz, Meme, DJ Sine, Marco Tozzi and Low Killa. The main album released by the collective is . The genres touched by the group range from Gangsta rap to Hardcore hip hop to Rap metal.\n2010s.\nSince 2010, after the success of the single \"Tranne te\" by Fabri Fibra, a real phenomenon of the mainstream rapper is created. Artists such as Emis Killa, Clementino, Fedez, Gemitaiz, MadMan, Rocco Hunt, Baby K, and Salmo make their debut in Italian hip hop. \nAt the same time artists are born who manage to bring their music to high levels of sale, examples of these artists are Noyz Narcos and Nitro. Around 2015, the trap influence arrives in Italy starting from albums like \"Santeria\" by Gu\u00e9 Pequeno and Marracash, \"XDVR\" and \"Sfera Ebbasta\" by Sfera Ebbasta, \"23 6451\" by tha Supreme and \"The Dark Album\" by the Dark Polo Gang. \nIt is followed by new artists such as Achille Lauro, Capo Plaza, Izi, Ghali, Ketama126, Massimo Pericolo, Ernia, tha Supreme and many others. Although, the underground remains firm with artists such as Jack the Smoker, Lord Madness, Murubutu, Claver Gold, Primo Brown (died in 2016), DJ Fastcut, Suarez, Leslie, Hard Squat Crew, Inoki, Rancore, Mezzosangue, Lanz Khan, Mattak (Italian-speaking but Swiss), Gionni Gioielli, L'Elfo, En?gma and many others. \nDuring the decade, albums that have already become classics of the genre such as \"Il ragazzo d'oro\" by Gu\u00e8 Pequeno, \"Mea culpa\" by Clementino, \"The Island Chainsaw massacre\" by Salmo, \"Il cuore e la fame\" by Egreen and \"Dead Poets\" by DJ FastCut are released.\n2020s.\nAmong the artists of the alternative hip hop genre that include En?gma, with the series of albums \"Totem\", started with \"Totem \u2013 Episodio uno\", anticipated by the single \"Bomaye\". Other important artists are Madame and Willie Peyote, both present at the 71st edition of the Sanremo Music Festival respectively with the songs \"Voce\", produced by Dardust and \"Mai dire mai (La locura)\". At the start of 2021, Il Tre released his first album, \"Ali\", that debuted on the first place in the FIMI chart just 1 week after its release. Other modern Italian rappers, such as Wado, focus more on issues of immigration and racism in their lyrics, which still affect many Afro-Italian rappers today. \nOther forms of the hip hop.\nFreestyle.\nThe first to have practiced freestyle in Italy were Neffa, Danno from Colle der Fomento, El Presidente and Moddi MC from the crew Pooglia Tribe. Clementino is a multiple-time Italian freestyle champion.\nDJing, writing and breakdancing.\nFrom the overseas situation, writing, beatboxing and breakdancing have been \"imported\", as well as DJing. DJs include DJ Jad, Don Joe, Shablo, DJ Tayone, DJ Squarta (Cor Veleno), DJ Double S, Deleterio, DJ Nais, DJ Gruff, DJ Shocca, Mr. Phil, DJ 2P, Bassi Maestro, Big Joe and DJ Harsh.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53189", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53189", "title": "GNU Bison", "text": "Yacc-compatible parser generator program\nGNU Bison, commonly known as Bison, is a parser generator that is part of the GNU Project. Bison reads a specification in Bison syntax (described as \"machine-readable BNF\"), warns about any parsing ambiguities, and generates a parser that reads sequences of tokens and decides whether the sequence conforms to the syntax specified by the grammar.\nThe generated parsers are portable: they do not require any specific compilers. Bison by default generates LALR(1) parsers but it can also generate canonical LR, IELR(1) and GLR parsers.\nIn POSIX mode, Bison is compatible with Yacc, but also has several extensions over this earlier program, including\nFlex, an automatic lexical analyser, is often used with Bison, to tokenise input data and provide Bison with tokens.\nBison was originally written by Robert Corbett in 1985. Later, in 1989, Robert Corbett released another parser generator named Berkeley Yacc. Bison was made Yacc-compatible by Richard Stallman.\nBison is free software and is available under the GNU General Public License, with an exception (discussed below) allowing its generated code to be used without triggering the copyleft requirements of the licence.\nFeatures.\nCounterexample generation.\nOne delicate issue with LR parser generators is the resolution of conflicts (shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts). With many LR parser generators, resolving conflicts requires the analysis of the parser automaton, which demands some expertise from the user.\nTo aid the user in understanding conflicts more intuitively, Bison can instead automatically generate counterexamples. For ambiguous grammars, Bison often can even produce counterexamples that show the grammar is ambiguous.\nFor instance, on a grammar suffering from the infamous dangling else problem, Bison reports\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pre/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReentrancy.\nReentrancy is a feature which has been added to Bison and does not exist in Yacc.\nNormally, Bison generates a parser which is not reentrant. In order to achieve reentrancy the declaration codice_1 must be used. More details on Bison reentrancy can be found in the Bison manual.\nOutput languages.\nBison can generate code for C, C++, D and Java.\nFor using the Bison-generated parser from other languages a language binding tool such as SWIG can be used.\nLicense and distribution of generated code.\nBecause Bison generates source code that in turn gets added to the source code of other software projects, it raises some simple but interesting copyright questions.\nA GPL-compatible license is not required.\nThe code generated by Bison includes significant amounts of code from the Bison project itself. The Bison package is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) but an exception has been added so that the GPL does not apply to output.\nEarlier releases of Bison stipulated that parts of its output were also licensed under the GPL, due to the inclusion of the yyparse() function from the original source code in the output.\nDistribution of packages using Bison.\nFree software projects that use Bison may have a choice of whether to distribute the source code which their project feeds into Bison, or the resulting C code made output by Bison. Both are sufficient for a recipient to be able to compile the project source code. However, distributing only the input carries the minor inconvenience that the recipients must have a compatible copy of Bison installed so that they can generate the necessary C code when compiling the project. And distributing only the C code in output, creates the problem of making it very difficult for the recipients to modify the parser since this code was written neither \"by\" a human nor \"for\" humans - its purpose is to be fed directly into a C compiler.\nThese problems can be avoided by distributing both the input files and the generated code. Most people will compile using the generated code, no different from any other software package, but anyone who wants to modify the parser component can modify the input files first and re-generate the generated files before compiling. Projects distributing both usually do not have the generated files in their version control systems. The files are only generated when making a release.\nSome licenses, such as the GPL, require that the source code be in \"the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it\". GPL'd projects using Bison must thus distribute the files which are the input for Bison. Of course, they can also include the generated files.\nUse.\nBecause Bison was written as a replacement for Yacc, and is largely compatible, the code from a lot of projects using Bison could equally be fed into Yacc. This makes it difficult to determine if a project \"uses\" Bison-specific source code or not. In many cases, the \"use\" of Bison could trivially be replaced by the equivalent use of Yacc or one of its other derivatives.\nBison has features not found in Yacc, so some projects can truly be said to \"use\" Bison, since Yacc would not suffice.\nThe following list is of projects which are known to \"use\" Bison in the looser sense, that they use free software development tools and distribute code which is intended to be fed into Bison or a Bison-compatible package.\nA complete reentrant parser example.\nThe following example shows how to use Bison and flex to write a simple calculator program (only addition and multiplication) and a program for creating an abstract syntax tree. The next two files provide definition and implementation of the syntax tree functions.\n/*\n * Expression.h\n * Definition of the structure used to build the syntax tree.\n * @brief The operation type\ntypedef enum tagEOperationType\n eVALUE,\n eMULTIPLY,\n eADD\n} EOperationType;\n * @brief The expression structure\ntypedef struct tagSExpression\n EOperationType type; /* /&lt; type of operation */\n int value; /* /&lt; valid only when type is eVALUE */\n struct tagSExpression *left; /* /&lt; left side of the tree */\n struct tagSExpression *right; /* /&lt; right side of the tree */\n} SExpression;\n * @brief It creates an identifier\n * @param value The number value\n * @return The expression or NULL in case of no memory\nSExpression *createNumber(int value);\n * @brief It creates an operation\n * @param type The operation type\n * @param left The left operand\n * @param right The right operand\n * @return The expression or NULL in case of no memory\nSExpression *createOperation(EOperationType type, SExpression *left, SExpression *right);\n * @brief Deletes a expression\n * @param b The expression\nvoid deleteExpression(SExpression *b);\n * Expression.c\n * Implementation of functions used to build the syntax tree.\n * @brief Allocates space for expression\n * @return The expression or NULL if not enough memory\nstatic SExpression *allocateExpression()\n SExpression *b = (SExpression *)malloc(sizeof(SExpression));\n if (b == NULL)\n return NULL;\n b-&gt;type = eVALUE;\n b-&gt;value = 0;\n b-&gt;left = NULL;\n b-&gt;right = NULL;\n return b;\nSExpression *createNumber(int value)\n SExpression *b = allocateExpression();\n if (b == NULL)\n return NULL;\n b-&gt;type = eVALUE;\n b-&gt;value = value;\n return b;\nSExpression *createOperation(EOperationType type, SExpression *left, SExpression *right)\n SExpression *b = allocateExpression();\n if (b == NULL)\n return NULL;\n b-&gt;type = type;\n b-&gt;left = left;\n b-&gt;right = right;\n return b;\nvoid deleteExpression(SExpression *b)\n if (b == NULL)\n return;\n deleteExpression(b-&gt;left);\n deleteExpression(b-&gt;right);\n free(b);\nThe tokens needed by the Bison parser will be generated using flex.\n%{\n * Lexer.l file\n * To generate the lexical analyzer run: \"flex Lexer.l\"\n%option outfile=\"Lexer.c\" header-file=\"Lexer.h\"\n%option warn nodefault\n%option reentrant noyywrap never-interactive nounistd\n%option bison-bridge\nint yyerror(SExpression **expression, yyscan_t scanner, const char *msg) {\n fprintf(stderr, \"Error: %s\\n\", msg);\n return 0;\nThe names of the tokens are typically neutral: \"TOKEN_PLUS\" and \"TOKEN_STAR\", not \"TOKEN_ADD\" and \"TOKEN_MULTIPLY\".

In a language such as C, \"int *ptr\" denotes the definition of a pointer, not a product: it would be wrong to name this \"*\" \"TOKEN_MULTIPLY\".\nSince the tokens are provided by flex we must provide the means to communicate between the parser and the lexer. The data type used for communication, \"YYSTYPE\", is set using Bison \"%union\" declaration.\nSince in this sample we use the reentrant version of both flex and yacc we are forced to provide parameters for the \"yylex\" function, when called from \"yyparse\".

{"id": "53190", "revid": "47756513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53190", "title": "German hip-hop", "text": "Music genre\nGerman hip-hop (locally known as \"Deutschrap\") refers to hip hop music in the German language. Elements of American hip hop culture, such as graffiti art and breakdancing, diffused into Western Europe in the early 1980s.\nHistory.\n1980\u20131990.\nEarly underground artists included Cora E. and Advanced Chemistry. It was not until the early 1990s that German hip hop entered the mainstream as groups like Die Fantastischen Vier and the R\u00f6delheim Hartreim Projekt gained popularity. German hip hop was heavily influenced by films, leading to a strong emphasis on visual and cultural elements such as graffiti and breakdancing beyond the music itself.\nIn addition to films, such as Wild Style and Beat Street, American expats and soldiers stationed in Germany facilitated the introduction of hip hop music and culture into German pop culture.\n\"GLS United\" released the first German language hip hop song, \"Rapper's Deutsch\", in 1980. While the group (consisting of three radio DJs including the later comedian and TV host Thomas Gottschalk) was formed explicitly for the one song, and the song was intended primarily as a parody of Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang, it was none-the-less the first German hip hop group and first German-language hip hop track. Also the punk rock band Die Toten Hosen released one of the first German hip hop songs, Hip Hop Bommi Bop, in 1983, which also was one of the first rap rock crossovers ever. The song, created in collaboration with Fab 5 Freddy, is a parody hip hop version of their song Eisgek\u00fchlter Bommerlunder. Nina Hagen also raps in her 1983 single New York / N.Y. \"New York New York\", the English version of \"New York / N.Y.\", was successful in American dance charts, peaking at number nine on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Songs.\nThese hip hop movies -\"Wild Style\" and \"Beat Street\"- led the younger audiences in Germany to realize that hip hop was much more than just rap music, but was very much a cultural movement in and of itself. Though at the time of the release of the movie, it did not have a great overall impact, once German reunification began in 1990, the hip hop scene began to flourish. As one German remembers on a visit to the US in 1986, things were much different. MTV did not exist in Europe at the time, and the scene was still very much underground. Moreover, there was a lack of European hip hop clubs.\nAfter this initial wave of popularity, hip hop fans were few and far between. However, the fans that did remain would play a role in the resuscitation of the hip hop culture. \"The hardcore hip-hop fans that remained after the breakdance craze faded from the media were central to the further development of hip hop in Germany-they supplied much of the personnel for the important rap groups that began to develop in the late 1980s and early '90s.\" \"Graffiti and breakdancing came out big but it only lasted for a short period of time. But hip hop survived in the underground.\"\nAmerican hip hop continued to influence the German scene, influencing emergent acts such as Rock Da Most. Originally most German rappers relied on English language lyrics, a fact which has led some academics and groups of the German public to interpret the emergence of hip hop in German pop culture as \"cultural imperialism\": that is to say, as a movement that emulated the culture of the United States at the expense of their native German cultural traditions. The influence of American hip hop artists remains strong even in today's German language hip hop scene: music videos rely on similar symbols of power and affluence, such as cars and jewelry.\nMany German hip hop artists are of Turkish-German or Arab-German descent, often second- and third-generation German citizens who grew up in comparatively poor or \"tough\" neighborhoods, which has become an influential hip hop narrative. Identification with their roots in neighborhoods remains an important aspect of the identity of individual rappers and their \"crews\".\nWhen not rapping in English, many German rappers employ a dialect of German developed in these communities and which is therefore associated with immigrants and the German \"ghetto\". Using this language in their music, some academics have argued, enables them to levy criticism and protest aspects of society and politics that they perceive as having disadvantaged them and their communities.\nDie Fantastischen Vier (the Fantastic Four) are another important German hip hop group, who also began to rap in German around the same time as Advanced Chemistry. Die Fantastischen Vier saw English rap in Germany as meaningless loyalty to \"surface elements\" of U.S. rap, and devoid of any German political or social context. They sought to appropriate hip hop from its foreign framework, and use it to bring a voice to historical and contemporary problems in Germany. The shift of rapping from English into German increased hip hop's appeal to the German people, Gastarbeiter (guest workers) included. Growing self-confidence among Germany's immigrant population coincided with the use of the German language in German hip hop, and provided them with a vocal outlet in line with the plight of poor African Americans, out of which hip hop had originally emerged.\nThe Group \"Advanced Chemistry\" originated from Heidelberg, Germany. As they were one of the few early hip hop groups to rap in English, they were extremely influential in promoting the hip hop scene in Germany. More importantly, however, \"Advanced Chemistry\" was a prominent hip hop group, because of the ethnic diversity of the members. Torch, the leader of the group for instance is both of a Haitian and German ethnic background. \"Advanced Chemistry\" exploded onto the German hip hop scene in November 1992 with their first mixed single entitled \"Fremd im eigenen Land\" (Foreign in Your Own Country). This song was immensely popular because it directly addressed the issue of immigrants in Germany: \"In the video of the song, a band member brandishes a German passport in a symbolic challenge to traditional assumptions about what it means to be German. If the passport is not enough, the video implies, then what is required? German Blood?\".\nAfter the reunification of Germany in 1990, many Germans saw a growing wave of racism. Because many hip hop artists were children of immigrants, this became a major theme of German hip hop.\nDuring the 1980s Germany first saw a wave of second generation immigrants coming into the country. Immigration became a big issue in hip hop albums at this point. The German synonym for an immigrant is Gastarbeiter, which means \"guest worker\", and these \"guest workers\" were rapped about often. Immigrant teenagers commonly use rap and hip hop as a way to defend themselves in their new countries. \"Since honour cannot be gained, but only lost, a permanent readiness to fight is required. Thus social approval is acquired by actually defending one's honour or by exhibiting abilities such as the willingness to face physical encounter, talkativeness and humour... According to the rules of the game, the first one to whom nothing clever comes to the mind is the loser. This concept is quite similar to 'dissing' in rap.\"\n1990\u20131995.\nIn 1991, the German music label \"Bombastic\" released the record Krauts with Attitude: German Hip Hop Vol. 1. The album featured fifteen songs \u2013 three in German, eleven in English, and one in French. The album was produced by DJ Michael Reinboth, a popular hip hop DJ at that time. Michael Reinboth moved to Munich in 1982 and was the first DJ to introduce Garage House and Old school hip hop music to the Munich club scene. His compilation \"Krauts with Attitude\" is considered one of the first German hip hop albums, as it features Die Fantastischen Vier. The title refers to N.W.A (Niggaz with Attitude), one of the most controversial hip hop groups of the time in the United States. \"Krauts with Attitude\" was the first album to nationalize German hip hop, and its album packaging reflected this. \"The cover was designed in the colours of the national flag (black, red and yellow), and the liner notes read as follows: 'Now is the time to oppose somehow the self confidence of the English and the American.'\" \nIn the early 1990s, hip hop established itself in the mainstream, and many new rappers emerged on the scene. One such band was Die Fantastischen Vier, four rappers from Stuttgart, whose optimistic sound and lighthearted lyrics have brought them fame both in Germany and abroad. Apparently, original crew members Smudo and Thomas D, were inspired to begin rapping in German following a six-month visit to the United States. It became apparent that they had nothing in common with U.S. rappers and their essentially middle-class upbringing was foreign to that of the cultural environment of U.S. hip hop. \"The group subsequently decided to concentrate on issues they saw around them, using their own language, rather than aping American styles.\"\nAlthough Die Fantastischen Vier achieved commercial success and helped to pioneer hip hop music in Germany, they were contested for sounding \"too American.\" The group's lack of socially conscious topics and simplistic delivery and material informed the ways in which they were viewed as a trite pop group.\nDuring 1992\u201393 many acts of protest occurred in the wake of rising anti-immigration sentiment in Germany. Amongst the angst of this period, the content of German hip hop started to become more politicized. Additionally, the language of the music started to reflect a more local voice. The group Advanced Chemistry has been noted as one of the first to incorporate social critiques of growing prejudice and racism in Germany. \"\u2026the newly emerging hip hop movement took a clear stance for the minorities and against the marginalisation of immigrants who, as the song said, might be German on paper, but not in real life\" In 1992 the group released the single Fremd im eigenen Land. The song dealt with the widespread racism that non-white German citizens faced. In the same year, another rock-hip-hop collaboration emerged. The punk rock band Die Goldenen Zitronen, together with the US-American rapper Eric IQ Gray and the hip-hop group \"Easy Business\", released the maxi-single \"80 000 000 Hooligans\", which includes a rap version of their song \"80 Million Hooligans\". The song addressed the nationalism and hatred against foreigners that emerged in Germany after the reunification.\nDuring the inception of hip hop into Germany, most popular hip hop artists have come from West Germany. This could be because of the large immigrant population there at the time. \"By 1994, the number of immigrants living in Germany had reached 6.9 million. 97 per cent of all immigrants were resident in the western part of the country, which meant that in the former Federal Republic of Germany and in West Berlin every tenth citizen was a foreigner.\" Of those 97% of immigrants in the Western part of Germany over 1.5\u00a0million of them originated from a European country. For example, the community with the largest number of immigrants (roughly 1.9\u00a0million people) was the Turkish community. Within the Turkish community only 5% of its people were of age 60 or older. Such statistics give justification for why hip hop may have flourished in Germany; many of the people were young. Furthermore, German hip hop, much like many other countries, was heavily influenced by the western world. During that time, a rises of anti-immigrant feelings resulted in the acts of arson and murder against the Turkish asylum seekers. In May 1993, 5 Turkish people were killed and many injured when someone attacked the home of a Turkish family with a firebomb. In 1993 German hip hop \"globalized\" with the emergence of \"Viva's Freestyle\"; the equivalent to the American Yo! MTV Raps show. \"Viva's freestyle\" consisted of hip hop songs from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. The influx of immigrants into Germany caused an adverse effect on employment and wages. It was found that immigrants and native Germans were imperfect substitutes for each other, while old and new immigrants were interchangeable exposing an inelastic labor market.\nIn the mid-1990s German hip hop was growing. John Clarke used the term 'recontextualization' to describe the process of borrowing cultural ideas and integrating them into a new society. German hip hop did just this as it took US hip-hop and gave it a new meaning and identity in German culture. Black American gangsta rap, however, is not the only type of rap that has developed in Germany. Some of the most innovative rap music in Germany is made by Germans or by underground crews dedicated to rap for both political and artistic reasons. Rap has been able to succeed in Germany not just due to a different national culture of the U.S., but also because people are responding to other racial and ethnic cultures.\nAt this time, in the mid-1990s, the relation of import and domestic rap was 70% import to 30% domestic, but domestic was increasing rapidly. CD's had practically taken over the market in Germany and cassettes were almost out and were just used for black copies. German hip hop was yet to have a specific identity as different styles occurred due to ethnic and musical background.\n1995\u20132000.\nThis was also a time that a lot of immigrants were moving to Germany and they all came with their own culture which contrasted with or added to that of Germany.\nKarakan also emerged in the German hip hop scene. In 1991, Alper Aga &amp; Kabus Kerim formed the group in Nuremberg, Germany as an offshoot of the hardcore rap group King Size Terror, which included Alper and rapper/producer Chill Fresh. That year, they released the first-ever Turkish language rap track in, named \"Bir Yabanc\u0131n\u0131n Hayat\u0131\" (Life of a Foreigner). Two years later, they released classic tracks like \"Cehenneme Ho\u015fgeldin\" (Welcome to Hell) and the controversial \"Defol Dazlak\" (Begone Skinhead), which was released as a Maxi Single. \"Big Porno Ahmet\" joined the group as a producer/beatmaker. Shortly, the success of Karakan spread beyond the borders of Germany and the group started to get well known within the European hip hop scene. During jams, they met Cinai Sebeke (Da Crime Posse) and Erci-E. Together, they established the legendary group CARTEL and released a compilation album in 1995. In 1997, KARAKAN finally released his first official album \"Al Sana Karakan\" and shot 2 videos, which marked a high point in Turkish hip hop.\nThe multilingual and multinational group TCA- The Microphone Mafia is an example of 'Oriental Hip Hop in the German Diaspora'. They combine Spanish, Italian, Turkish and German raps with live music and samples of traditional music from all the previously named countries.\n2000 to present.\nIn October 2006, what is thought to be the first US-released commercial compilation of German hip hop (and reggae), \"Big Up Berlin,\" was released in the US. It received 4.5 of 5 stars in All Music Guide (now known as All Music) and featured artists such as Bushido, Fler, Kool Savas, Azad and others.\nToday, the German hip hop scene is a reflection of the many dimensions that Germany has come to represent in a unified image of Europe. Everything from \"migrant hip hop,\" which is known as hip hop from the large Turkish immigrant population, to the more humour-based groups paint a portrait of a vibrant and diverse hip hop community in Germany.\nDespite common notions of the Old School German hip hop's emulation of US hip hop styles and the New School's attempt to rap about crime and violence, some \"Old Schoolers\" feel that the New School has, in fact, forgotten about its roots. Old School supporters and Scholars disagree on the nature of the recent transformation in German hip hop. Scholars have argued that the Old School German hip hop \"scene was musically and vocally oriented to American role models. Rhymes were written in English; funk and soul samples dominated musical structures\". However, Old Schoolers themselves contend that it is the New School German rap artists who have been \"Americanized,\" and therefore lack the authenticity of the struggle of the ghetto in West Germany. The German old school acknowledged that there were many differences between the situation in the United States and the situation in Germany, and aimed at expressing the concept of \"realness,\" meaning to \"be true to oneself\". Different from the US hip hop's equating \"realness\" with a tougher \"street credibility,\" many raps that came out of the old school German hip hop \"address this issue and reject unreflected imitation of US hip hop as clich\u00e9s and as the betrayal of the concept of realness\". Furthermore, the Old School of German hip hop may have been seen as representing \"a critique of White America\" because of its modeling after US hip hop; however, Old schoolers dispute that hip hop in Germany was about the oppression of people in Germany. One Old School artist, DJ Cutfaster lamented that, \"Most people have forgotten that hip hop functions as a mouthpiece against violence and oppression and ultimately against the ghetto, which has become the metaphor for the deplorable state of our world\". Contrary to the New School hip hop's attempts to crossover into the mainstream popular culture, the Old School \"envisioned and propagated hip hop as an underground community that needed to keep its distance from and to create resistance to mainstream culture in order to avoid co-optation\".\nArtists.\nGerman rappers with most No. 1 on German album charts.\n10 Albums\n9 albums\n6 albums\n5 albums\nGerman rappers who reached No. 1 on German single charts.\n22 Singles\n12 Singles\n9 Singles\n8 Singles\n6 Singles\n5 Singles\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nHannibal Verlag, 2000"}

They led the hip hop culture in Switzerland until the end of the 1980s and even after.\nAlthough some of them returned to anonymity since then or died young, the most of these \"old schoolers\" are still around, watching what's going on. Some of them are still taking part of actual hip hop events and others are even still active (like Seyo in Painting Art, others are dealing with music industry in different music styles) and living this culture yet mostly in their heart with a nostalgic state of mind.\nRap.\nEarly Swiss German rappers started rapping in English, but after the bilingual track \"Murder by Dialect\" by P-27 featuring Black Tiger, rappers switched to their native Swiss German dialects. Rappers from the French-speaking part (where the traditional dialects died out in most parts) and from the Italian-speaking part (where most people mix dialects and Standard Italian freely) rap in the standard languages.\nThe issue of language choice has become a major influence in the Swiss hip hop scene: As author Pascale Hofmeier notes, the creation of \"Mundartrap\" (dialect rap) has enabled Switzerland to develop a unique scene that, due to the lingual choice, is immediately identifiable as a distinctly Swiss product. The importance of language in Swiss hip hop can also create tension, however: Although the members of the Italian-speaking group Stoffunita live in Switzerland and consider it their home, their choice of language combined with their lack of Swiss citizenship earmark them as \"Secondo\", a term used to indicate people of foreign descent born in Switzerland. Given Switzerland's particularly strong opinions on who is \"Swiss\" and who is \"other\", it is easy to see that groups such as Stoffunita make use of the fact that hip hop \"is still considered a voice for the oppressed\" as hip hop scholar and author Jeff Chang notes.\nThe European Music Office's report on \"Music in Europe\" claimed that Switzerland's hip hop scene is \"particularly innovative and advanced\", featuring Unik Records (the first European indie rap label).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53194", "revid": "23646674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53194", "title": "Greek hip-hop", "text": "Music genre\nGreek hip hop (, ), is a music genre, also known as \"the music of the streets\" derived from the American hip hop culture. There are many sub-genres many times interacting with other types of greek music such as \u00c9ntekhno, with many artists of either genres collaborating.\nJust as in the US, hip hop is divided into four basic characteristics: DJing (\"disc jockey\"), which has advanced greatly recently due to the development of technology. The second one is MCing (\"master of ceremony\"), where the people involved in it are called MCs or rappers. The third one is Graffiti, also recently, considering it being an art, graffiti has become a sort of a grey area legally with police many times turning a blind eye to it with events being organised frequently with graffiti at their focus. The fourth and last one is breakdancing.\nHistory.\nThe late 80s toward the 90s: the first generation \u2013 the beginnings.\nThe first time Rap and/or Hip Hop was heard in Greece was in the 70s by the broadcasts of the US military base. In the early 80s concepts such as Graffiti and Break Dance came to Greece, setting up the base of Greek hip hop.\nThe earliest indications of the localized genre date back to 1987 the Maxi-single Deejays's with the group FF.C, though native language albums did not appear until the mid-1990s. The first hip hop album was \"Diamartiria\" (protest) in 1993 of Active Member along with \"\u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03af \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03af\" (Hard Times) by FF.C. Both albums released under the independent label \"Freestyle Productions\". Though many can argue that the album Modern Fears \"\u0397 \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\" (circa 1992) by Aris Thomas was the first hip hop influenced record in Greece. Then Razastarr followed with their unreleased demo on Freestyle Productions, and TXC with their single \"Terror X Crew\" in 1995. Also, in 1987 rapper Aris Tomas came to the scene, although he became more aligned with the dance and disco scene. The first Greek hip-hop album was released in 1990 called \"En+Taxei\" (from the greek \"\u0395\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\" meaning Okay) the album was released by O.P.A. (Oppresive People Group). One of te first hip-hop groups was also Stereo Nova, their first album the same name came out in 1992.\nThe same year in a Public Enemy concert in Nikaia, the low-bap group Active Member was created. A few years later they founded Freestyle Productions in which participated both the late Pavlos Fyssas (Killah P) and Social Waste, with the hopes of differentiating themselves from the rest of Greek hip-hop who started to look a lot alike with its American counterpart. This led to a split between the two scenes, which led to a lot of criticism towards Active Member by many groups even later on such as RNS in 2018.\nn 1993 the album R.E.A.L (Rap Elevate Above Law) was released by many of the bands participating in freestyle productions (Active Member, Drama N' Vinyl, Real D, Loyal T, Maffic)\nIn 1994 \u039d\u0395\u0392\u039c\u0391 were created, a hip hop band with social problems. The same time Goin' Through who became a fundamental part of the scene. In the end of the same year begun circulation of the magazine \"radicalistic\" by freestyle productions. At the same time Active Member released their second album \"Stin ora ton Skion\" (\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03ce\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd). In 1996Imiskoumpria made their debut in the scene them being the first clearly satirical band in the hip-hop scene.\nLate 90s \u2013 The new Millennium: The Second Generation \u2013 The Golden Era.\nGangsta rap came to Greece in 1997 with the group Zontanoi Nekroi (\u0396\u03c9\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af \u039d\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03af; \"Living Dead\"). In 1999 the group Paremvoles (\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03c2) released the first hardcore CD named \"En Opsi\" (\u0395\u03bd \u03cc\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9; \"In consideration of\").\nTheir first album named \"\u0396\u039d: \u0395\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03c2 / \u03a3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03a7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd MC\u2019s\" (ZN: Entoles / Sti Hora on Kalyteron MC's\") (1997) then O Protos Tomos (\u039f \u03a0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) (1998) These have been characterised as the greatest hits of Greek hip-hop being founding parts of battle rap. Almost all rap in Greece today traces itself to ZN.\nIn 2000 the group Alfa Gama (\u0386\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1 \u0393\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1 [\u0391.\u0393.]) continued with the CD named \"Agnostofovia\" (\u0391\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03b2\u03af\u03b1; \"Fear of the unknown\"). Imiskoumbria and Goin' Through made Greek hip-hop famous in the mainstream Greek audience. Goin' Through changed their way of music from hip hop to a kind of R&amp;B or Pop music.\nThe lyrics then were largely political but there were still some satirical bands: Vavilona, La Klikaria, Dr. Dreez, Deaky Dee.\nNew bands and dissolution of old ones.\nIn the early 2000s many old bands of the '90s dissolved or changed form: Terror X Crew dissolved in 2002 after DJ ALX left. FF.C dissolved in 2005. While Active Member splintered after X-Ray left and created \u03a1\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. Razastarr dissolved in 2017 with their album \"Afou Skotoso ti Dipsa Mou\" (\u0391\u03c6\u03bf\u03cd \u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03ce\u03c3\u03c9 \u03a4\u03b7 \u0394\u03af\u03c8\u03b1 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5).\nFrom 2001 onwards new bands were established. which's releases were largely digital, free and without corporate interference, leading to a plethora of new releases. Many bands were created but they largely didn't lead long lasting careers. Some bands of the Second Generation adapted and continued for some time, like VitaPeis, \u03c4\u03b1 Voreia Asteria, G.I.ANT.S, Bong Da City, Flowjob, United Crew, RNS (RolleNStoned squad) Yonka Mayonka.\nMany of the artists participating in the aforementioned bands came to lead Solo careers even after the bands' dissolutions. Many Voreia Asteria members such as Tzamal and Mikros Kleftis continued their careers beyond the 2010s and into the later eras of rap. Most famously Lex came to lead a much more famous career. Also, other rappers such as Tsaki who participated in both Bong Da City and still participates in Yonka Mayonka. \nMainstream scene.\nIn the 2000s hip-hop became so well known that it begun to develop a commercial character. With Imiskoubria singer saying himself: \"We were never marginalised musicians[...]\".\nThis commercialization had started already by the 90's with Imiskoubria's humorous attitude which can be shown in the 2001 single \"Pame oli mazi se mia paralia\" (\u03a0\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5 \u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b6\u03af \u03c3\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1) which became a massive success. The singles \"Greek Lover\" and \"Sex\" had similar success released in 2004. The same year Goin' Through saw great success with the single \"Poso malakas eisai\" (\u03a0\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9). Until 2007 Goin' Through and Family the Label were the most successful and well-recognised hip-hop label in Greece.\nIn 2007 more artists came up in the Hip-Hop scene with more successes such as Stavento who became famous through the radio hit \"Mesa sou\" (\u039c\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5), Ypo or Ypohthonios (ZN member) with the success \"Kane ntou\" (\u039a\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5 \u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5).\nUnderground scene.\nThe difference between underground and commercial Hip-Hop was visible. Consdidering underground hip-hop has much more hardcore lyrics and was promoted through HipHop.Gr, and radio station \"Atlantis FM\" while commercial hip-hop was promoted through large music vendors. In the duration of the 2000s came up many new artists and also many older artists came back to the surface such as: 12os Pithikos, \u0391nser, Iratus,Tiny jackal, Lex and Tzamal (Former members of Voreia Asteria), Logos Apeili, Sadomas, Rapsodos Filologos, Vevilos(Member of Vavilona), Social Waste, Fi Vita Sigma (FVS) among others.\nEarly 2010s: third generation \u2013 the crisis.\nDuring the new decade and onwards the internet gave a further rise in popularity to rap. At the same time, a large part of the audience, it being mostly teens or pre-teens, abandoned other forms of Greek music dedicating themselves to rap. Considering rappers were now expressing emotions through rap and their everyday life, this way being more relatable but also more political.\nNew crews who came to the new greek Hip Hop scene are Logos Timis, Joker/Two-Face and Fi Vita Sigma. The latter two bands were made by members of Bong Da City, who after the \"Purple n' Blue\" mixtape of 2011, their last album, went either solo, or with other bands.\nThe new generation of rap has given plenty to the Boom bap genre with new bands being created constantly: Bloody Hawk, Mr.YO, Hawk, Logos Timis, Skiahtro, Katholou Crew, Rammenos Assos, Novel 729, Ethismos, Los Hermanos, Expend Flow, Zoro&amp;Buzz, Lobo, Fer De Lance, Obnoxious Kas, Poetic, Tropeau Roman among others.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Turkish minority, called the Turks, first drew inspiration from the discrimination and racism they received while living as migrant workers in Germany in the 1960s. Turkish hip hop uses Arabesk music, a folk style that finds its roots in Turkey during the 1960s, and is influenced by the hip hop music of America and Germany. Album artwork, lyrical content, and the Turkish language are used by hip hop artists to express their uniquely Turkish identity.\nThe first Turkish hip hop album was recorded by the Nuremberg, Germany group King Size Terror in 1991. Islamic Force (now known as KanAK) is often recognized as the beginning of Turkish hip hop. Turkish hip hop is still used as an outlet for many who feel marginalized as Turks living in German society.\nHistory.\nBefore Turkish hip hop took hold in Turkey, specifically Istanbul and Ankara, it originally grew out of Turkish ethnic enclaves in Germany. Owing its large population to the Turkish migrants that came to Germany in the 1960s as Gastarbeiter (guest-workers), 2/3 of all Turks in Germany are under the age of 35 and half are under 25. Exclusionary practices on behalf of the government, particularly in terms of citizenship status, create systematic discrimination of Turks in Germany that fuels racism against migrant workers. Although born in Germany, the children of these Gastarbeiters are not recognized as citizens by Germany or their parents' country of origin. Often living in dilapidated neighborhoods and marked as outsiders by their \"eastern\" traditions and poor command of the German language, Turkish urban youth gravitate towards hip hop as means of expressive identity construction. From the first rap vinyl recorded in the Turkish language\u2014\u2018Bir Yabanc\u0131n\u0131n Hayat\u0131\u2019 (The Life of a Foreigner) by King Size Terror\u2014to the creation of an entire subgenre\u2014Oriental hip hop\u2014Turkish youth in Germany have embraced and moved beyond pure imitation of African American hip-hop culture. Localizing hip hop, Turks in Germany have reworked it to \u201cact as a mode of expression for a range of local issues\u201d particularly those related racism and the problem of national identity experienced by younger members of ethnic minority groups.\nTurkish hip-hop had risen to prominence in Germany with the success and popularity of the Turkish rap group Cartel in the mid 1995s throughout Turkey. After the success of their first album, the members of Cartel had a fight almost killing some of their members. The group was forbidden to perform together again and the members of Cartel were jailed. Cartel's album was banned from the music market.\nIn Turkey, Ceza, Dr. Fuchs (formerly \"Nefret\"), Fuat Ergin and Sagopa Kajmer were spearheads of the genre. Sansar Salvo, Pit10, \u015eehin\u015fah, Hayki, Saian, All\u00e2me are popular figures of second wave contemporary rap music in Turkey. New generation or 'Drill' include Ezhel, UZI, Ben Fero and LVBEL C5.\nTurkish Migration to Germany.\nAfter being recruited by the German government to fill the labor shortages in specific industries, Turkish migrants relocated to German cities such as Berlin and Frankfurt under the \u2018myth of return\u2019. The first generation of migrants came to Berlin as individual workers and then slowly brought their families over. Gastarbeiters, by nature of the very word (translated as \u2018guest worker'), expected to return to their homeland and did not identify with Germany. This mentality combined with government exclusionary practices caused many Turks to feel alienated and displaced; they maintained an outsider position in society. Whereas the German government could recruit temporary guest workers, they could also be controlled and sent away as the interest of capital dictated. Turks in Germany, excluded because of German policies regarding citizenship, rallied around ethnic lines as a political strategy.\nBecause of poor integration policies in Germany, Turkish immigrants isolated themselves in ethnic enclaves away from the dominant society and created their own vibrant communities. After Germany passed a law in 1983 to pay foreigners to leave the country, Turks set up their own services to mediate between individuals and the government, creating institutionalized space. Discrimination in Western Europe forced immigrants to constitute their own communities and to define their group boundaries in cultural terms. Children of migrants who were born in Germany and grew up in these ethnic enclaves carry the norms and traditions of their parents' culture and the dominant society. Kreuzberg, a densely populated area in Berlin with a history of hosting guest workers, is dubbed \u2018Kleines Istanbul\u2019 or \u2018Little Istanbul.\u2019 Reminiscent of the atmosphere in Istanbul, Kreuzberg is full of local Turkish businesses, open Turkish markets, travel agencies offering regular flights to Turkey, and a Turkish language library. Turks in Germany maintain strong connections to their homeland while constructing local Turkish networks through the conduits of globalization; Turkish language mass media is salient in Berlin.\nInfluences.\nBefore Turkish hip hop took root in Germany, it was influenced by American and German hip hop. Whereas German hip hop gained widespread appeal throughout the early 1995s, it wasn't until Advance Chemistry's single \u201cFremd im eigenen Land\u201d (\u201cStrangers in Our Own Land\u201d) that plight of the immigrant was addressed. For Turkish youth who didn't identify with Germany as a homeland, localized German hip hop still did not appeal to them nor function as a medium of self-expression. Looking for representation of their own heritage, Turkish artists and producers used German hip hop as a springboard to create Turkish inspired rap lyrics and beats. In an interview with Andy Bennet one Turkish-German label owner put it: \u201cWell, from a musical point of view we\u2019re trying to combine traditional Turkish melodies and rhythms with rap. The kids have been doing it for a while\u2026 you can buy tapes of Turkish music from Turkish stores around the city and they\u2019ve been experimenting with that music, sampling it, mixing it with other stuff and rapping to it\u2026 We\u2019re just trying to build on the Turkish rap thing and build an outlet for it\u2026 If I\u2019m going to tell you why we\u2019re doing it, well, it\u2019s pride really. The point about a lot of this German rap it\u2019s all about coloured guys saying look at us, we\u2019re like you, we\u2019re German. But I don\u2019t feel like that I never have. I\u2019m not German, I\u2019m a Turk and I\u2019m passionately proud of it\u201d.\nLanguage.\nThe most obvious demarcation of Turkish hip hop in Germany is language. As Bennet writes, \u201cthe fact of language itself can also play a crucial role in informing the way in which song lyrics are heard and the forms of significance which are read into them\u201d. First and foremost, Turkish rap distinguishes itself from German and American hip hop by the utilizing the Turkish language rather than German or English. Feridun Zaimoglu, one of Germany\u2019s leading literary figures, describes the Turkish most hip hop artists employ as \u2018Kanak Sprak.\u2019 \u2018Kanak Sprak\u2019 makes a direct reference to local racism in Germany This creolized Turkish-German spoken by the disenfranchised youth of the hip-hop generation is characterized as sentences without commas, full stops, capital letters, and any kind of punctuation as well as frequent switches between Turkish and German Kanak Sprak alone, without even delving into the lyrics, sets Turkish hip hop apart from pure imitation of American music and makes it more meaningful for its Turkish listeners. For example, when Cartel\u2014the original Turkish-language rap project to get off the ground\u2014released their debut album to address the first generation of Turkish immigrants in Berlin, it sparked an international controversy. Although some refrains were rapped in German, most of the lyrics as well as promotional materials and paraphernalia were in Turkish. Cartel even reclaimed the word \u2018Kanak\u2019 from its derogative roots by using it liberally in their album, \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed, be proud to be a Kanak!\u201d and branding it all over their T-shirts and stickers. This not only marked hip-hop culture as distinctly Turkish, but simultaneously created a separate public sphere for fans of Turkish hip hop because most Germans did not speak Turkish. The very fact that the language of the album was in Turkish shifted the balance of power from privileged Germans to oppressed Turks. In the liner notes of the cd, \u201cthe English words \u2018What are they sayin?!\u2019 appear in big bubble letters. Underneath, the caption teasingly reads in German: \u2018Didn\u2019t pay attention in Turkish class? Then ask for the translations fast with this card\u2019\u201d.\nAesthetics and Local Significance.\nIn addition to rapping in the language of their ancestral homeland, Turkish hip hop is aesthetically different from German hip hop. Primarily, Turkish hip-hop artists choose to sample Arabesk music in their songs drawing upon a mythic Turkish past. Arabesk is folk music style that originally appeared in Turkey during the 1960s as a reflection of migrant workers first experience of immigration inside the homeland As Brown writes, \u201cWith its bittersweet longing for a homeland left behind\u2014a homeland most Turkish-German youngsters could never have seen expect perhaps on vacation\u2014Arabesk expresses a nostalgia and cultural pessimism that dovetails perfectly with hip hop\u2019s invention of community through stories of displacement\u201d (Brown, 144). In describing Turkish music, Mc Boe-B from Islamic Force tells the narrative, \u201cboy comes home and listens to hip hop, then his father comes along and says \u2018come on boy, we\u2019re going shopping.\u2019 They get in the car and the boy listens to Turkish music on the cassette player. Later, he gets our record and listens to both styles in one\u201d \nFurthermore, album artwork and lyrical content enable hip-hoppers and fans to identify commercially and express individually their Turkish identity. In order to see a comprehensive picture of the cultural groundwork Turkish hip hop accomplishes, it's important too take a closer look at the origins of the movement as well as specific examples of local artists. Oriental hip hop owes much of its origins to hip-hop groups that were briefly mentioned earlier: Islamic Force and Cartel. Islamic Force (now KanAK) was founded in the 1980s as a way to give ethnic minorities in Germany a voice and is often recognized as the spark that started Oriental hip hop. Along with hip-hop artists DJ Derezon, the group released their first single, \u201cMy Melody/Istanbul in 1995 to fight racism towards Turks in Germany by combining Western and Turkish cultures (Hip-Hop Culture). By rapping in English and mixing African-American hip-hop beats with Turkish Arabesk, Islamic Force is a perfect example of Boe-B\u2019s kid who listens to both Turkish and American cassettes in his father\u2019s car. Although they initially focused on American hip hop by rapping in English to gain Western acceptance, an increase in the groups popularity in Turkey led them to eventually switch to rapping in Turkish. By rapping in their native language, Islamic Force connected directly with Turkey as a country as well as their cultural background while simultaneously merging a global genre (hip hop) with a local culture (Turkish traditions) According to Diessel, \u201cThe synthesis of Turkish musical idioms and language with hip hop was successful in appealing to a young audience. For Turkish youth in Germany, Oriental hip hop is at once profoundly local and simultaneously global; it imagines, through the evocation of the far reaching \u2018Orient\u2019 and the cohesive language of hip hop, multiple possibilities of resistance to the politics of exclusion\u201d \nCommon Themes.\nThe first rap vinyl to be recorded in the Turkish language was 'Bir Yabanc\u0131n\u0131n Hayat\u0131' ('The Life of a Foreigner'), by the Nuremberg, Germany crew King Size Terror. As the title of this track suggests, immigration of Turks around the world, especially Germany, was difficult to cope with. This was due to the almost 2 million Turks in Germany, half of whom were between the ages of 25 and 45. As a result of the fall of the Berlin Wall in the early 1995s a refreshed form of nationalism paved the way for a new youth culture- hip hop. Since Turks felt very marginalized by German society, they turned to hip hop in order to express their concerns. This oriental hip hop allowed Turkish youngsters to discuss what it meant to them to be a German foreigner and how they still identified as being Turkish. In Frankfurt were DJ Mahmut &amp; Murat G. the early starters in Turkish rap, Murat was rapping in both languages German and Turkish, DJ Mahmut delivered the eastern and western sounds. Over the self-founded label Looptown Records they released the first Turkish rap album in 1995 with the compilation Looptown presents Turkish Hip Hop with German-Turkish artists out.\nThe first solo album DJ Mahmuts and Murat Gs followed only a few years later with Garip D\u00fcnya (1997). With this record, the duo toured in 1999 through major cities in Turkey. As a result of this following, groups such as Karakon, an offspring of King Size Terror, reached super stardom as a result of the release of Cartel in Germany in 1995. Cartel was targeted directly to German Turkish youth to be used as a musical lobby for thousands of kids who needed a voice through which they could express the discrimination they have faced in German society. This voice is that of Oriental Hip Hop.\nOriental hip hop is a way for disenfranchised youth to mark their place in German society. They live in Germany, but may feel like outcasts because they do not fit perfectly into the cookie-cutter mold of being only German or only Turkish. Turkish hip-hop has allowed the youth to embrace their identity and let others know that although some may see them as exiles in Germany, the youth take pride in themselves, their community, and their heritage. In fact, it even incorporates an element of \"rebellion\" towards the discrimination Turks face in German society, and hip-hop is united with other cultural expressions in this regard. For instance, popular German author Feridun Zaimoglu adopts a hip-hop friendly hybridization of German and Turkish in his book \"Kanak Sprak\", that allows German Turks to reclaim a pejorative term. This disenfranchised group, defined by one scholar as \"hyphenated German citizens,\" is drawn to hip-hop as a form of expression because its members have been denied representation and recognition by the majority. In \"The Vinyl Ain't Final* Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture\", ed . by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, they quote \"Advanced chemistry thus represents not a rejection of the idea of 'Germanness', but a vision of multicultural type of 'Germanness'. Hip hop is important not just because it is art, but because it is a weapon against racial chauvinism and ethnic nationalism. But nationalism is not absent from the German rap scene; on the contrary, there is an implicit (and sometimes explicit) conflict over national identity that finds expression, on the one hand, in charges that the attempt to form a 'German' rap culture is inherently exclusionary, and on the other, in the growth of a counter-nationalism in the form of ethnic-Turkish or so-called 'Oriental hip hop'\" (142) In \"From Krauts with attitudes to Turks with attitudes: some aspects oh hip hop history in Germany\", written by Dietmar Eleflein, \"Yet at the same time, the title Krauts with Attitude also played with a kind of non-dissident identification of a part of the West German hip-hop scene with its role models. Here the structural signs of competition could be coded nationally in terms of an integration in an international framework* what started as 'Bronx against Queens' or 'East Coast against West Coast' gradually turned into 'FRG against USA'. Further, Niggaz with Attitude themselves, together with performers like Ice Cube and Dre Dre, initiated the 'gangsta hip-hop', a subgenre which was especially popular in those parts of the Western German scene in which identification with this youth culture bordered on glorification\" (258) .\nOriental hip hop was the product of two innovations, having to do with the Turkish language and the choice of material which started with King Size Terror\u2019s \u2018The Life of the Stranger. This art created a new and more useful identity for the Turkish population in Germany. Oriental hip hop represented the second and third generation Turks that rebelled against the policy in Germany; Turkish individuals were discriminated against because of their race. Turkish youth have adopted hip hop as a form of musical expression, commentary, and protest.\nA distinctive trait of Turkish rap is the fact that languages other than English and German are used. Rapping in Turkish tongue has had its benefits and its costs. On a positive note, making music with Turkish lyrics helped rappers make their music more personal. It also allowed these artists to localize what was considered to be a foreign U.S. musical commodity into an artistic form that represented their people, situations, and causes. On the negative side of this, some felt that rapping in a language other than English or German further isolated these artists in the German music scene and placed labels on them. As one member of the Turkish rap group Cartel notes, \u201cRapping consistently in Turkish was not necessarily a choice but rather the result of being defined by mainstream culture as different, more precisely defined within the framework of Orientalist discourse as the exoticized other and marketed as such.\" However, Turkish hip-hop can be seen as truly ground-breaking due to the music its artists elect to sample in songs. Instead of simply using clips from American rap songs in their music, Turkish rappers decided to further localize the music and put culturally relevant Turkish samples in songs. As Brown writes, \u201cThe central musical innovation in \u2018Oriental hip-hop\u2019 \u2013 the rejection of African American samples in favor of samples drawn from Turkish \"Arabesk\" a pop \u2013 is emblematic of the blending of diasporic Black culture and diasporic Turkish culture.\"\nDiasporic community.\nIn embracing these Turkish traditions, accessible to them from their parents as well as familial ties to Turkey, Turkish youth in Berlin are influenced by a culture not tied one hundred percent to their current geographical location. Through \u2018imaginary\u2019 journeys back to the homeland\u2014whether it's reminiscing about vacations to Istanbul or public discourse about Turkey\u2014Turkish-German youth construct their local identities from global places. In addition to the physical transmission of hip-hop cassettes to Germany, globalization enables a transnational movement as well as identity by connecting alienated youth to their ethnic roots. Modern circuitry connects youth not only to the rest of the world, but also to the \u2018homeland\u2019. This transcendence of physical borders is exemplified in Turkish hip hop. Azize-A, born in Berlin to a Turkish family, released her first hip-hop album called, Es ist Zeit (It's time) in 1997. Considered the first \u2018Turkish hip-hopper lady\u2019 Germany, Azize-A gained popular media attention by addressing issues Turkish women deal with as double-minorities. While her appeal is largely to young girls\u2014Azize-A has often been described as the Turkish Queen Latifah\u2014she also directly addresses issues of national identity. In her song, \u2018Bosphorus Bridge,\u2019 this Berlin-Turk rapper attempts to \u201clocate the descendants of Turk migrants in a hybrid space where cultural borders blend, where periphery meets the centre, and where the West merges East (. She raps in Turkish,\" We live together on planet earth/And if we want to grow in peace/We need to erase our borders,/Share our rich cultures./Yes, connect and blend the West/ West with the East.\" Using a reference to the \u2018Bosphorus Bridge\u2019\u2014a bridge in Turkey that connects the European and Asian sides\u2014she calls for Turks in Germany to cross invisible cultural borders. In a similar vein, MC Boe-B expresses his double diasporic identity as well as the quest for his homeland in his song \u2018Selam\u0131n aleyk\u00fcm.\u2019 Translated by Ayhan Kaya, Mc Boe-B raps the following lyrics, \" They arrive in Istanbul from their villages/ And got searched in the German customs/It is as if they got purchased/Germans thought they\u2019d use and kick them off /But they failed to/Our people ruined their plans/Those peasants turned out to be clever/They worked hard/Opened a bakery or a doner kebab/on each corner/ But they paid a lot for this success\" Referring to those who have been twice migrants, these lyrics begin by expressing the hardship guest workers faced when they first arrived in Germany. As the song progresses, Boe-B identifies himself within this context of struggle when he raps, \u201cWe are losing life, losing blood/I was chosen to explain these things/Everybody screams \u2018Tell us Boe-B\u2019/ And I am telling our story as hip hop in Kadikoy\u2019/...We tell you our experiences/we present you the news/we connect our neighbourhood and Kadikoy/we are doing real hip hop/and we tell it to you/...I am telling this story in a far land, Kadikoy.\nIn distinguishing themselves from their German counterparts, Turkish hip hop culture in Germany creates a diasporic Turkish community essential to the nature and success of a Turkish youth subculture. In \"Global Culture\", Appadurai describes diasporic communities as a type of ethnoscape. He defines ethnoscapes as, \u201cthe landscapes of persons who constitute the shifting world in which we live: tourist, immigrants, refugees, guest-workers and other moving groups and persons\u201d Ethnoscapes, \u201callow us to recognize that our notions of space, place and community have become much more complex, indeed a \u2018single community\u2019 may now be dispersed across a variety of sites\u201d. Through hip hop Turkish youth in Germany have done precisely that; they have created a community that transcends one specific geographical location. As demonstrated by popular Turkish hip-hop artists, it is only through the global connection to their homeland, that Turkish youth in Berlin find meaning in their local contexts. Turkish hip hop is a \u201cyouth culture that enables ethnic minority youths to use both their own \u2018authentic\u2019 cultural capital and the global transcultural capital in constructing and articulating their identities\u201d. By embracing hip-hop culture, Turkish youth reclaim a sense of pride, assert their space in the public sphere, and reaffirm their Turkish heritage. As they rework hip hop to act as a mode of expression for a range of local issues\u2014a common theme in global hip hop\u2014Turkish youth also create a diasporic community. It is only through the creation of this diasporic community that Oriental hip hop moves beyond simple appropriation of African-American and German tradition while performing cultural works at a grassroots level \nTurkish versus German hip hop.\nAlthough being most prominent in Germany, Turkish hip hop is placed in opposition to German hip hop. Timothy Brown in \"\u2018Keeping it Real\u2019 in a Different \u2018Hood: (African-) Americanization and Hip-Hop in Germany\", described Turkish hip hop as the product of a language and source material innovation. According to an article about German hip hop in The Bomb Hip-Hop Magazine, Germany is full of immigrants, and consequently, everyone raps in the language they prefer. Turkish hip hop artists rap in their own Turkish language and sample Turkish folk music as opposed to American or German songs. This musical subgenre is therefore seen as a counter nationalism movement marking the Turkish ethnicity within the German nationalism as a whole. It became a weapon against racial chauvinism and ethnic nationalism in Germany.\nControversies.\nIn 2006, the members of Nefret broke up and Dr. Fuchs released the song \"Hani Biz Karde\u015ftik (Ceza Diss)\" (\"I thought we were like brothers\") on his official website. The song claimed that Turkish rapper Ceza had abandoned his team for money and more fame. At the time, Ceza was one of the few rappers played on popular Turkish television stations such as Kral TV. In August, Turkish Rock singer K\u0131ra\u00e7 explained in an interview that he believed Hip Hop should stay out of Turkish music. He believed that Hip Hop was only brainwashing music and that it took nothing to make a song. He criticized Turkish singers Tarkan and former members of Nefret during his interview and he believed that they should stop trying to make rap music. Ceza responded to this by performing a song about K\u0131ra\u00e7 which used a lot of explicit content. K\u0131ra\u00e7 later announced that he planned to sue Ceza in court. Afterwards, Ceza instantly apologized to K\u0131ra\u00e7 and he said that he will think twice in the future before doing something like this.\nIn 2007, Turkish rapper Ege \u00c7ubuk\u00e7u released an underground diss single against Ceza titled \"Cennet Bekleyebilir\" (\"Heaven Can Wait\"). He accused Ceza of stealing beats from American rapper Eminem's music. He claimed that Ceza's hit song \"Sitem\" had exactly the same beat as \"The Way I Am\" by Eminem. The single had little support and airplay.\nWhile Turkish hip hop has been seen to be a form of expression of immigrant youth in areas such as Germany, its authenticity and credibility have been challenged. Artists such as Tarkan, a Turkish pop star, has claimed that \"Turkish hip-hop is not original, its something we really are not.\" While he also incorporates much western influence and electronic, he believes that pop is the form of music which protects the Turkish essence and that musical genres such as hip hop and rock have only been paid attention to as a result of pop music being overplayed on the radio. The notion of the \"underground\" is prominent in Turkish hip-hop as it points to the marginalisation and censorship of rap within the music scene in Turkey and also connotes the rappers pursuit for authenticity in their music. \nIn Europe.\nThe first Turkish language hip hop record was titled \"Bir Yabanc\u0131n\u0131n Hayat\u0131\" or \"The Life of Serkan Danyal Munir Raymondo Tatar\", produced by King Size Terror, a Turkish-German group from Nuremberg, in 1991. Stranger in this context refers to how Turkish youth can feel like strangers to the mainstream German culture. Turkish hip hop continues to influence the hip hop scenes in Western Europe, especially in Germany where many top chart rappers such as Kool Sava\u015f (who has collaborated with 50 Cent, RZA, Jadakiss, &amp; Juelz Santana) Summer Cem and Eko Fresh are of Turkish descent. While Nefret was performing Turkish rap in Turkey and Germany from 1999\u20132002, another Turkish rap network emerged, however this time from Switzerland with Makale in 1997 with other groups in Europe followed suit like c-it from France who hand a hit single in turkey titled my name. Many Turks came to Germany and UK as immigrants, or what is there referred to as \"guest workers\", and created their own enclaves. For example, there are entire neighborhoods in Berlin that are predominantly Turkish, such as Gesundbrunnen and Kreuzberg, in which the influence of Turkish culture as well as the feeling of alienation or isolation from the rest of the city is present.\nIt is in these settings that hip hop has become an important tool for the German and UK-born children of the Turkish guest workers to express themselves. They used this new form of expression, influenced by American hip hop, to explore and deal with the idea of being \"strangers\" or \"foreigners\" even when they had been born German.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originating in early 20th century Australia, the movement has expanded globally to other countries, including New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Surf lifesavers in Australia are colloquially known as \"Clubbies\".\nHistory.\nSurf lifesaving originated in Australia in 1907 in response to drownings at local beaches in Sydney. Such groups became necessary following the relaxing of laws prohibiting daylight bathing on Australian beaches. Volunteer groups of men were trained in life saving methods and patrolled the beaches as lifesavers looking after public safety.\nThere had been some debate between Manly Life Saving Club, Bronte Surf Lifesaving Club and Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club as to which was formed first. After a panel of SLSA historians reviewed all the documentation provided by each club in 2005, SLSA agreed that they recognise Bondi as the first surf life saving club. They stated \"A hardy perennial in surf lifesaving history is the question of the first surf club \u2013 Bondi or Bronte. As this study has shown, the first group of organised lifesavers formed on Manly Beach in 1899. While moves on Bondi, Bronte and Manly in early 1907 saw the organisation of irregulars, it was the surf bathers of Bondi who first organised themselves as a formal club in February 1907\". The Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club was officially established on 21 February 1907, at the Royal Hotel in Bondi \u2013 as was recorded in the newspaper \"The East Sydney Argus\", and in the Waverley Council minutes acknowledging receipt of a letter from the newly formed group.\nOn 10 October 1907, the Surf Bathing Association of New South Wales (SBANSW) was founded with nine clubs and affiliated associations. The nine \"foundation\" clubs were the Royal Life Saving Society, Manly Surf Club, Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club, Coogee Surf Life Brigade (Coogee Surf Life Saving Club), Bronte Surf Brigade (Bronte Surf Lifesaving Club), Bondi Surf and Social Club (North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club), Tamarama Surf Club (later disbanded, however nowadays Tamarama Surf Life Saving Club), Maroubra Surf Club (Maroubra Surf Life Saving Club), United Wanderers Surf Club, and Woollahra Surf Club. The first club outside of Sydney was Kiama Surf Bather's Club, founded in 1908.\nThe first New Zealand Surf Lifesaving Clubs began in the years 1909 to 1910 leading off with: Castlecliff (Wanganui), Lyall Bay (Wellington), New Brighton (Christchurch) and Worser Bay (Wellington). Within the next few years other clubs started forming around five regions: Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, Gisborne/Napier/New Plymouth and Wanganui.\nIn the northern region, Piha Surf Life Saving Club was founded in 1934 and as such is the oldest club on Auckland's west coast and is the home of Piha Rescue. Soon after the New Zealand clubs were formed, rivalry began to take place which created the forming of competition between the clubs and regions. By early 1912 competitions were being organised by Wellington's Maranui Club, with male members competing in squads of eight. The competitions consisted of a land drill and 'reel test'. The first New Zealand National Champs where clubs were able to compete was held in 1922.\nThe Surf Life Saving Great Britain (SLSGB) organisation was formed in 1955. Volunteer clubs patrolled beaches in England at Bude and St. Agnes in Cornwall and at Brighton, their aim to protect, rescue and resuscitate bathers. Voluntary organisations exist in Germany, such as DLRG and Wasserwacht.\nRescue services.\nLifesavers are volunteers that typically patrol in groups under a patrol captain for a given period of time on weekend and public holidays under a roster system. In order to be a surf lifesaver a person must hold a Bronze Medallion or a Surf Rescue Certificate and pass an annual proficiency test. Lifesavers who are on patrol wear red and yellow cloth caps on the head. While not performing rescues they are also required to wear long-sleeve yellow shirts and red shorts to provide protection against the sun. Support Operations Lifesavers are required to wear the appropriate functional attire. This includes wetsuits for RWC (Rescue Water Craft) drivers, JRB/ORB (jet and offshore rescue boat) crew and high visibility tabards for Duty Officers who liaise with other emergency services at major incidents. The crews of various Lifesaver helicopter services over the country wear appropriate aviation equipment. Each surf life saving club also has a competition cap with distinct colours or patterns. These are worn during competition and for training on the beach. The patrolled area of the beach is marked out with red and yellow flags and beachgoers are encouraged to swim between the flags. Those wishing to use surfcraft are required to remain outside the flags.\nIn the UK, SLSGB has a long history of voluntary members patrolling local beaches, offering advice, first aid and rescue services. This continues today and is a vital service to the community. Many local authorities provide a lifeguard service from May to September on popular beaches. In some areas Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) Lifeguards operate on behalf of the local authority.\nCompetition.\nThe other key part of surf life saving is the competitive sport which evolved from the training activities of lifesavers at Australian and New Zealand surf beaches, though most events share little with modern inflatable rescue boat (IRB) based surf rescue techniques. The sport is still based on volunteer clubs which perform rescue duty, from children in the \"nippers\" category through to professional elite circuits that have been established for the high-profile \"ironman\" events. The sport is still mainly in Australia and New Zealand. However, the Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service in Canada has run the Nova Scotia Surf League competitions every summer since 2000, and competition programs exist in five regions of Canada. In Europe the sport is increasingly developed, with Italy, Spain and Germany particularly strong and the UK, the Netherlands and Ireland developing rapidly.\nSurf life saving clubs regularly hold surf carnivals where clubs compete with each other in a range of beach- and rescue-oriented events including combined swimming and running, surf ski and surf boat races. The youth arm of the clubs is known as Nippers, and holds similar events.\nThe various events involve elements of surf swimming, board riding, sand running, mock rescues using rowed surf boats, and paddling special kayak-like surf skis. Some events are for individuals, but many are team events.\nIndividual surf lifesaving events include:\nIndividual surf life saving clubs compete at the state and national levels at the annual State Championships and Australian Surf Life Saving Championships where around 450 events are run over nine days of competition with over 6,000 competitors from around Australia and internationally.\nLife saving today.\nSurf lifesaving in Australia is well-developed as both a voluntary lifesaver service and as a competitive sport. There are 314 surf lifesaving clubs in Australia that collectively patrol over 400 beaches. In the 2003\u20132004 season there were 24,968 active members (those who are rostered to patrol regularly), of which approximately 40% are women. In the 2003-2004 patrol season, lifesavers performed 9,044 rescues, provided emergency care to 26,739 patients, and undertook 171,965 preventive actions.\nSurf life savers provide important surf rescue services on beaches in Australia on weekends and public holidays throughout the patrol season on a volunteer basis. In New South Wales the season coincides with the beginning of the September school holidays and finishes on ANZAC Day. They also provide year-round on-call volunteer rescue services in most areas known as Support Services.\nLifesavers are distinguished in Australia from paid lifeguards which are generally employed by the relevant Local Government authority and patrol the beach throughout the year. Lifeguards also patrol lakes, pools, and other aquatic venues. Support Services also operate to augment the patrols on the beach by providing surveillance away from the flag areas and emergency back-up when required.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53197", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53197", "title": "Aztec mythology", "text": "Religious folklore of the Nahua peoples of the Triple Alliance (Aztec Empire) \nAztec mythology is the body or collection of myths of the Aztec civilization of Central Mexico. The Aztecs were a culture living in central Mexico and much of their mythology is similar to that of other Mesoamerican cultures. According to legend, the various groups who became the Aztecs arrived from the North into the Anahuac valley around Lake Texcoco. The location of this valley and lake of destination is clear \u2013 it is the heart of modern Mexico City \u2013 but little can be known with certainty about the origin of the Aztec. There are different accounts of their origin. In the myth, the ancestors of the Mexica/Aztec were one of seven groups that came from a place in the north called Aztlan, to make the journey southward, hence their name \"Azteca.\" Other accounts cite their origin in Chicomoztoc, \"the place of the seven caves\", or at Tamoanchan (the legendary origin of all civilizations).\nThe Mexica/Aztec were said to be guided by their war-god Huitzilopochtli, to an island in Lake Texcoco, they saw an eagle, perched on a nopal cactus, holding a rattlesnake in its talons. This vision fulfilled a prophecy telling them that they should found their new home on that spot. The Aztecs built their city of Tenochtitlan on that site, building a great artificial island, which today is in the center of Mexico City. This legendary vision is pictured on the Coat of Arms of Mexico.\nCreation myth.\nAccording to legend, when the Mexica arrived in the Anahuac valley around Lake Texcoco, they were considered by the other groups as the least civilized of all, but the Mexica decided to learn... and they took in all that they could from the other people, especially from the ancient Toltec (whom they seem to have partially confused with the more ancient civilization of Teotihuacan). To the Aztec, the Toltec were the originators of all culture; \"Toltecayotl\" was a synonym for culture. Aztec legends identify the Toltecs and the cult of Quetzalcoatl with the legendary city of Tollan, which they also identified with the more ancient Teotihuacan.\nBecause the Aztecs adopted and combined several traditions with their own earlier traditions, they had several creation myths. One of these, the Five Suns, describes four great ages preceding the present world, each of which ended in a catastrophe, and \"were named in function of the force or divine element that violently put an end to each one of them\". Coatlicue was the mother of Centzon Huitznahua (\"Four Hundred Southerners\"), her sons, and Coyolxauhqui, her daughter. At some point, she found a ball of feathers and placed it in her waistband, thus becoming pregnant with Huitzilopochtli. Her other children became suspicious as to the identity of the father, and vowed to kill their mother. She gave birth on Mount Coatepec, pursued by her children, but the newborn Huitzilopochtli (born fully armed and prepared to fight) defeated most of his brothers, who then became the stars. He also killed his half-sister, Coyolxauhqui, by tearing out her heart using Xiuhcoatl (a blue snake) and throwing her body down the mountain. This was said to inspire the Aztecs to rip the hearts out of their human sacrifices and throw their bodies down the sides of the temple dedicated to Huitzilopochtli, who represents the sun, chasing away the stars at dawn.\nOur age (\"Nahui-Ollin\"), the fifth age, or fifth creation, began in the ancient city of Teotihuacan. According to the myth, all the gods had gathered to sacrifice themselves and create a new age. Although the world and the sun had already been created, it would only be through their sacrifice that the sun would be set into motion, and time and history could begin. The strongest and most handsome of the gods, Tecuciztecatl, was supposed to sacrifice himself but when it came time to self-immolate, he could not jump into the fire. Instead, Nanahuatl the smallest and humblest of the gods, who was also covered in boils, sacrificed himself first, and jumped into the flames. The sun was set into motion with his sacrifice, and time began. Humiliated by Nanahuatl's sacrifice, Tecuciztecatl, too, leaped into the fire and became the moon.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53198", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53198", "title": "Aztecs", "text": "Ethnic group of central Mexico and its civilization\nThe Aztecs ( ) were a Mesoamerican civilization that flourished in central Mexico from 1300 to 1521. The Aztec people included different ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language. Aztec culture was organized into city-states (\"altepetl\"), some of which joined to form alliances, political confederations, or empires. The Aztec Empire was a confederation of three city-states established in 1427: Tenochtitlan (the capital city of the Mexica or Tenochca), Tetzcoco, and Tlacopan, previously part of the Tepanec empire, whose dominant power was Azcapotzalco. Although the term Aztecs is often narrowly restricted to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan, it is also broadly used to refer to Nahua polities or peoples of central Mexico in the prehispanic era, as well as the Spanish colonial era (1521\u20131821).\nMost ethnic groups of central Mexico in the post-classic period shared essential cultural traits of Mesoamerica. The culture of central Mexico includes maize cultivation, the social division between nobility (\"pipiltin\") and commoners (\"macehualtin\"), a pantheon, and the calendric system. Particular to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan was the patron god Huitzilopochtli, twin pyramids, and the ceramic styles known as Aztec I to IV. The Mexica were late-comers to the Valley of Mexico, and founded the city-state of Tenochtitlan on unpromising islets in Lake Texcoco, later becoming the dominant power of the Aztec Triple Alliance or Aztec Empire which conquered other city-states throughout Mesoamerica. It originated in 1427 as an alliance between the city-states Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan to defeat the Tepanec state of Azcapotzalco, which had previously dominated the Basin of Mexico. Soon Texcoco and Tlacopan were relegated to junior partnership in the alliance, with Tenochtitlan the dominant power. The empire extended its reach by a combination of trade and military conquest. It was never a true territorial empire controlling territory by large military garrisons in conquered provinces but rather dominated its client city-states primarily by installing friendly rulers in conquered territories, constructing marriage alliances between the ruling dynasties, and extending an imperial ideology to its client city-states. Client city-states paid taxes, not tribute to the Aztec emperor, the \"Huey Tlatoani\", in an economic strategy limiting communication and trade between outlying polities, making them dependent on the imperial center for the acquisition of luxury goods. The political clout of the empire reached far south into Mesoamerica conquering polities as far south as Chiapas and Guatemala and spanning Mesoamerica from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans.\nThe empire reached its maximum extent in 1519, just before the arrival of Spanish conquistadors led by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Cort\u00e9s allied with city-states opposed to the Mexica, particularly the Nahuatl-speaking Tlaxcalteca as well as other central Mexican polities, including Texcoco, its former ally in the Triple Alliance. After the fall of Tenochtitlan on 13 August 1521 and the capture of the emperor Cuauht\u00e9moc, the Spanish founded Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan and proceeded with the process of conquest and incorporation of Mesoamerican peoples into the Spanish Empire. With the destruction of the superstructure of the Aztec Empire in 1521, the Spanish used the city-states on which the Aztec Empire had been built to rule the indigenous populations via their local nobles. Nobles acted as intermediaries to convey taxes and mobilize labor for their new overlords, facilitating the establishment of Spanish colonial rule.\nAztec culture and history are primarily known through archaeological evidence found in excavations such as that of the renowned Templo Mayor in Mexico City; from Indigenous writings; from eyewitness accounts by Spanish conquistadors such as Cort\u00e9s and Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo; and especially from 16th- and 17th-century descriptions of Aztec culture and history written by Spanish clergymen and literate Aztecs in the Spanish or Nahuatl language, such as the famous illustrated, bilingual (Spanish and Nahuatl), twelve-volume Florentine Codex created by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, in collaboration with Indigenous Aztec informants. Important for knowledge of post-conquest Nahuas was the training of indigenous scribes to write alphabetic texts in Nahuatl, mainly for local purposes under Spanish colonial rule. At its height, Aztec culture had rich and complex philosophical, mythological, and religious traditions, as well as remarkable architectural and artistic accomplishments.\nDefinitions.\nThe Nahuatl words \"azt\u0113catl\" (, singular) and \"azt\u0113cah\" (, plural) mean \"people from Aztl\u00e1n\", a mythical place of origin for several ethnic groups in central Mexico. The term was not used as an endonym by the Aztecs themselves, but it is found in the different migration accounts of the Mexica, where it describes the different tribes who left Aztlan together. In one account of the journey from Aztlan, Huitzilopochtli, the tutelary deity of the Mexica tribe, tells his followers on the journey that \"now, no longer is your name Azteca, you are now Mexitin [Mexica]\".\nIn today's usage, the term \"Aztec\" often refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as \"M\u0113xihcah\" (, a tribal designation that included the Tlatelolco), \"Tenochcah\" (, referring only to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan, excluding Tlatelolco) or \"C\u014dlhuah\" (, referring to their royal genealogy tying them to Culhuacan).\nSometimes the term also includes the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan's two principal allied city-states, the Acolhuas of Texcoco and the Tepanecs of Tlacopan, who together with the Mexica formed the Triple Alliance, a state exerting control over the Valley of Mexico in a collective polity often known as the \"Aztec Empire\". The usage of the term \"Aztec\" in describing the empire and its people has been criticized by Robert H. Barlow, who preferred the term \"Culhua-Mexica\" in reference to the empire's people, and by Pedro Carrasco, who prefers the term \"Tenochca Empire\" in reference to their state. Carrasco writes about the term \"Aztec\" that \"it is of no use for understanding the ethnic complexity of ancient Mexico and for identifying the dominant element in the political entity we are studying\".\nIn other contexts, Aztec may refer to all the various city-states and their peoples, who shared large parts of their ethnic history and cultural traits with the Mexica, Acolhua, and Tepanecs, and who often also used the Nahuatl language as a lingua franca. An example is Jerome A. Offner's \"Law and Politics in Aztec Texcoco\". In this meaning, it is possible to talk about an \"Aztec civilization\" including all the particular cultural patterns common for most of the peoples inhabiting central Mexico in the late postclassic period. Such usage may also extend the term \"Aztec\" to all the groups in Central Mexico that were incorporated culturally or politically into the sphere of dominance of the Aztec empire.\nWhen used to describe ethnic groups, the term \"Aztec\" refers to several Nahuatl-speaking peoples of central Mexico in the postclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, especially the Mexica, the ethnic group that had a leading role in establishing the hegemonic empire based at Tenochtitlan. The term extends to further ethnic groups associated with the Aztec empire, such as the Acolhua, the Tepanec, and others that were incorporated into the empire. Charles Gibson enumerates many groups in central Mexico that he includes in his study \"The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule\" (1964). These include the Culhuaque, Cuitlahuaque, Mixquica, Xochimilca, Chalca, Tepaneca, Acolhuaque, and Mexica.\nIn older usage, the term was commonly used about modern Nahuatl-speaking ethnic groups, as Nahuatl was previously referred to as the \"Aztec language\". In recent usage, these ethnic groups are referred to as the Nahua peoples. Linguistically, the term \"Aztecan\" is still used about the branch of the Uto-Aztecan languages (also sometimes called the Uto-Nahuan languages) that includes the Nahuatl language and its closest relatives Pochutec and Pipil.\nTo the Aztecs themselves the word \"Aztec\" was not an endonym for any particular ethnic group. Rather, it was an umbrella term used to refer to several ethnic groups, not all of them Nahuatl-speaking, that claimed heritage from the mythic place of origin, Aztlan. Alexander von Humboldt originated the modern usage of \"Aztec\" in 1810, as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the Mexica state and the Triple Alliance. In 1843, with the publication of the work of William H. Prescott on the history of the conquest of Mexico, the term was adopted by most of the world, including 19th-century Mexican scholars who saw it as a way to distinguish present-day Mexicans from pre-conquest Mexicans. This usage has been the subject of debate in more recent years, but the term \"Aztec\" is still more common.\nHistory.\nSources of knowledge.\nKnowledge of Aztec society rests on several different sources: The many archeological remains of everything from temple pyramids to thatched huts can be used to understand many of the aspects of what the Aztec world was like. However, archeologists often must rely on knowledge from other sources to interpret the historical context of artifacts. There are many written texts by the indigenous people and Spaniards of the early colonial period that contain invaluable information about pre-colonial Aztec history. These texts provide insight into the political histories of various Aztec city-states, and their ruling lineages. Such histories were produced as well in pictorial codices. Some of these manuscripts were entirely pictorial, often with glyphs. In the postconquest era, many other texts were written in Latin script by either literate Aztecs or by Spanish friars who interviewed the native people about their customs and stories. An important pictorial and alphabetic text produced in the early sixteenth century was \"Codex Mendoza\", named after the first viceroy of Mexico and perhaps commissioned by him, to inform the Spanish crown about the political and economic structure of the Aztec empire. It has information naming the polities that the Triple Alliance conquered, the types of taxes rendered to the Aztec Empire, and the class/gender structure of their society. Many written annals exist, written by local Nahua historians recording the histories of their polity. These annals used pictorial histories and were subsequently transformed into alphabetic annals in Latin script. Well-known native chroniclers and annalists are Chimalpahin of Amecameca-Chalco; Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc of Tenochtitlan; Alva Ixtlilxochitl of Texcoco, Juan Bautista Pomar of Texcoco, and Diego Mu\u00f1oz Camargo of Tlaxcala. There are also many accounts by Spanish conquerors who participated in the Spanish invasion, such as Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo who wrote a full history of the conquest.\nSpanish friars also produced documentation in chronicles and other types of accounts. Of key importance is Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, one of the first twelve Franciscans arriving in Mexico in 1524. Another Franciscan of great importance was Fray Juan de Torquemada, author of \"Monarquia Indiana\". Dominican Diego Dur\u00e1n also wrote extensively about pre-Hispanic religion as well as the history of the Mexica. An invaluable source of information about many aspects of Aztec religious thought, political and social structure, as well as the history of the Spanish conquest from the Mexica viewpoint is the Florentine Codex. Produced between 1545 and 1576 in the form of an ethnographic encyclopedia written bilingually in Spanish and Nahuatl, by Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan and indigenous informants and scribes, it contains knowledge about many aspects of precolonial society from religion, calendrics, botany, zoology, trades and crafts and history. Another source of knowledge is the cultures and customs of the contemporary Nahuatl speakers who can often provide insights into what prehispanic ways of life may have been like. Scholarly study of Aztec civilization is most often based on scientific and multidisciplinary methodologies, combining archeological knowledge with ethnohistorical and ethnographic information.\nCentral Mexico in the classic and postclassic.\nIt is a matter of debate whether the enormous city of Teotihuacan was inhabited by speakers of Nahuatl, or whether Nahuas had not yet arrived in central Mexico in the classic period. It is generally agreed that the Nahua peoples were not indigenous to the highlands of central Mexico, but that they gradually migrated into the region from somewhere in northwestern Mexico. At the fall of Teotihuacan in the 6th century CE, some city-states rose to power in central Mexico, some of them, including Cholula and Xochicalco, probably inhabited by Nahuatl speakers. One study has suggested that Nahuas originally inhabited the Baj\u00edo area around Guanajuato which reached a population peak in the 6th century, after which the population quickly diminished during a subsequent dry period. This depopulation of the Baj\u00edo coincided with an incursion of new populations into the Valley of Mexico, which suggests that this marks the influx of Nahuatl speakers into the region. These people populated central Mexico, dislocating speakers of Oto-Manguean languages as they spread their political influence south. As the former nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples mixed with the complex civilizations of Mesoamerica, adopting religious and cultural practices, the foundation for later Aztec culture was laid. After 900 CE, during the postclassic period, many sites almost certainly inhabited by Nahuatl speakers became powerful. Among them are the site of Tula, Hidalgo, and also city-states such as Tenayuca, and Colhuacan in the valley of Mexico and Cuauhnahuac in Morelos.\nMexica migration and foundation of Tenochtitlan.\nIn the ethnohistorical sources from the colonial period, the Mexica themselves describe their arrival in the Valley of Mexico. The ethnonym Aztec (Nahuatl \"Aztecah\") means \"people from Aztlan\", Aztlan being a mythical place of origin toward the north. Hence the term applied to all those peoples who claimed to carry the heritage from this mythical place. The migration stories of the Mexica tribe tell how they traveled with other tribes, including the Tlaxcalteca, Tepaneca, and Acolhua, but that eventually their tribal deity Huitzilopochtli told them to split from the other Aztec tribes and take on the name \"Mexica\". At the time of their arrival, there were many Aztec city-states in the region. The most powerful were Colhuacan to the south and Azcapotzalco to the west. The Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco soon expelled the Mexica from Chapultepec and executed the first Aztec royal family except Queen Chimalxochitl II. In 1299, Colhuacan ruler Cocoxtli permitted them to settle in the empty barrens of Tizapan, where they were eventually assimilated into Culhuacan culture. The noble lineage of Colhuacan traced its roots back to the legendary city-state of Tula, and by marrying into Colhua families, the Mexica now appropriated this heritage. After living in Colhuacan, the Mexica were again expelled and were forced to move.\nAccording to Aztec legend, in 1323, the Mexica were shown a vision of an eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus, eating a snake. The vision indicated where they were to build their settlement. The Mexica founded Tenochtitlan on a small swampy island in Lake Texcoco, the inland lake of the Basin of Mexico. The year of foundation is usually given as 1325. In 1376 the Mexica royal dynasty was founded when Acamapichtli was elected as the first \"Huey Tlatoani\" of Tenochtitlan.\nEarly Mexica rulers.\nIn the first 50 years after the founding of the Mexica dynasty, the Mexica were a tributary of Azcapotzalco, which had become a major regional power under the ruler Tezozomoc. The Mexica supplied the Tepaneca with warriors for their successful conquest campaigns in the region and received part of the tribute from the conquered city-states. In this way, the political standing and economy of Tenochtitlan gradually grew.\nIn 1396, at Acamapichtli's death, his son Huitzilihhuitl (lit. \"Hummingbird feather\") became ruler; married to Tezozomoc's daughter, the relationship with Azcapotzalco remained close. Chimalpopoca (lit. \"She smokes like a shield\"), son of Huitzilihhuitl, became ruler of Tenochtitlan in 1417. In 1418, Azcapotzalco initiated a war against the Acolhua of Texcoco and killed their ruler Ixtlilxochitl. Even though Ixtlilxochitl was married to Chimalpopoca's daughter, the Mexica ruler continued to support Tezozomoc. Tezozomoc died in 1426, and his sons began a struggle for the rulership of Azcapotzalco. During this power struggle, Chimalpopoca died, probably killed by Tezozomoc's son Maxtla who saw him as a competitor. Itzcoatl, brother of Huitzilihhuitl and uncle of Chimalpopoca, was elected the next Mexica \"tlatoani\". The Mexica were now in open war with Azcapotzalco and Itzcoatl petitioned for an alliance with Nezahualcoyotl, son of the slain Texcocan ruler Ixtlilxochitl against Maxtla. Itzcoatl also allied with Maxtla's brother Totoquihuaztli ruler of the Tepanec city of Tlacopan. The Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan besieged Azcapotzalco, and in 1428 they destroyed the city and sacrificed Maxtla. Through this victory, Tenochtitlan became the dominant city-state in the Valley of Mexico, and the alliance between the three city-states provided the basis on which the Aztec Empire was built.\nItzcoatl proceeded by securing a power basis for Tenochtitlan, by conquering the city-states on the southern lake \u2013 including Culhuacan, Xochimilco, Cuitlahuac, and Mizquic. These states had an economy based on highly productive chinampa agriculture, cultivating human-made extensions of rich soil in the shallow lake Xochimilco. Itzcoatl then undertook further conquests in the valley of Morelos, subjecting the city-state of Cuauhnahuac (today Cuernavaca).\nEarly rulers of the Aztec Empire.\nMotecuzoma I Ilhuicamina.\nIn 1440, Moteuczomatzin Ilhuicamina (lit. \"he frowns like a lord, he shoots the sky\") was elected tlatoani; he was the son of Huitzilihhuitl, brother of Chimalpopoca and had served as the war leader of his uncle Itzcoatl in the war against the Tepanecs. The accession of a new ruler in the dominant city-state was often an occasion for subjected cities to rebel by refusing to pay taxes. This meant that new rulers began their rule with a coronation campaign, often against rebellious provinces, but also sometimes demonstrating their military might by making new conquests. Motecuzoma tested the attitudes of the cities around the valley by requesting laborers for the enlargement of the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan. Only the city of Chalco refused to provide laborers, and hostilities between Chalco and Tenochtitlan would persist until the 1450s. Motecuzoma then reconquered the cities in the valley of Morelos and Guerrero, and then later undertook new conquests in the Huaxtec region of northern Veracruz, and the Mixtec region of Coixtlahuaca and large parts of Oaxaca, and later again in central and southern Veracruz with conquests at Cosamalopan, Ahuilizapan, and Cuetlaxtlan. During this period the city-states of Tlaxcalan, Cholula and Huexotzinco emerged as major competitors to the imperial expansion, and they supplied warriors to several of the cities conquered. Motecuzoma therefore initiated a state of low-intensity warfare against these three cities, staging minor skirmishes called \"Flower Wars\" (Nahuatl \"xochiyaoyotl\") against them, perhaps as a strategy of exhaustion. In the Valley of Oaxaca, which was invaded Moctezuma's forces in the 1450s, the Aztec Empire would oppress the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples, who they would also require to pay tributes. \nMotecuzoma I also consolidated the political structure of the Triple Alliance and the internal political organization of Tenochtitlan. His brother Tlacaelel served as his main advisor () and he is considered responsible for the major political reforms in this period, consolidating the power of the noble class () and instituting a set of legal codes, and the practice of reinstating conquered rulers in their cities bound by fealty to the Mexica tlatoani.\nAxayacatl and Tizoc.\nIn 1469, the next ruler was Axayacatl (lit. \"Water mask\"), son of Itzcoatl's son Tezozomoc and Motecuzoma I's daughter Atotoztli II. He undertook a successful coronation campaign far south of Tenochtitlan against the Zapotecs in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Axayacatl also conquered the independent Mexica city of Tlatelolco, located on the northern part of the island where Tenochtitlan was also located. The Tlatelolco ruler Moquihuix was married to Axayacatl's sister, and his alleged mistreatment of her was used as an excuse to incorporate Tlatelolco and its important market directly under the control of the tlatoani of Tenochtitlan.\nAxayacatl then conquered areas in Central Guerrero, the Puebla Valley, on the gulf coast and against the Otomi and Matlatzinca in the Toluca Valley. The Toluca Valley was a buffer zone against the powerful Tarascan state in Michoacan, against which Axayacatl turned next. In the major campaign against the Tarascans () in 1478\u20131479 the Aztec forces were repelled by a well-organized defense. Axayacatl was soundly defeated in a battle at Tlaximaloyan (today Tajimaroa), losing most of his 32,000 men and only barely escaping back to Tenochtitlan with the remnants of his army.\nIn 1481 at Axayacatls death, his older brother Tizoc was elected ruler. Tizoc's coronation campaign against the Otomi of Metztitlan failed as he lost the major battle and only managed to secure 40 prisoners to be sacrificed for his coronation ceremony. Having shown weakness, many cities rebelled and consequently, most of Tizoc's short reign was spent attempting to quell rebellions and maintain control of areas conquered by his predecessors. Tizoc died suddenly in 1485, and it has been suggested that he was poisoned by his brother and war leader Ahuitzotl who became the next tlatoani. Tizoc is mostly known as the namesake of the Stone of Tizoc a monumental sculpture (Nahuatl \"temalacatl\"), decorated with a representation of Tizoc's conquests.\nAhuitzotl.\nThe next ruler was Ahuitzotl (lit. \"Water monster\"), brother of Axayacatl and Tizoc and war leader under Tizoc. His successful coronation campaign suppressed rebellions in the Toluca Valley and conquered Jilotepec and several communities in the northern Valley of Mexico. A second 1521 campaign to the gulf coast was also highly successful. He began an enlargement of the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan, inaugurating the new temple in 1487. For the inauguration ceremony, the Mexica invited the rulers of all their subject cities, who participated as spectators in the ceremony in which an unprecedented number of war captives were sacrificed \u2013 some sources giving a figure of 80,400 prisoners sacrificed over four days. Probably the actual figure of sacrifices was much smaller, but still numbering several thousand. There have never been found enough skulls in the capital to satisfy even the most conservative figures. Ahuitzotl also constructed monumental architecture in sites such as Calixtlahuaca, Malinalco, and Tepoztlan. After a rebellion in the towns of Alahuiztlan and Oztoticpac in Northern Guerrero, he ordered the entire population executed and repopulated with people from the valley of Mexico. He also constructed a fortified garrison at Oztuma defending the border against the Tarascan state.\nFinal Aztec rulers and the Spanish conquest.\nMotecuhzoma Xocoyotzin is known to world history as the Aztec ruler when the Spanish invaders and their indigenous allies began their conquest of the empire in a two-year-long campaign (1519\u20131521). His early rule did not hint at his future fame. He succeeded in the rulership after the death of Ahuitzotl. Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin (lit. \"He frowns like a lord, the youngest child who is dead as he had lived in life but not death\"), was a son of Axayacatl, and a war leader. He began his rule in standard fashion, conducting a coronation campaign to demonstrate his skills as a leader. He attacked the fortified city of Nopallan in Oaxaca and subjected the adjacent region to the empire. An effective warrior, Moctezuma maintained the pace of conquest set by his predecessor and subjected large areas in Guerrero, Oaxaca, Puebla, and even far south along the Pacific and Gulf coasts, conquering the province of Xoconochco in Chiapas. he also intensified the flower wars waged against Tlaxcala and Huexotzinco and secured an alliance with Cholula. He also consolidated the class structure of Aztec society, by making it harder for commoners () to accede to the privileged class of the \"pipiltin\" through merit in combat. He also instituted a strict sumptuary code limiting the types of luxury goods that could be consumed by commoners.\nIn 1517, Moctezuma received the first news of ships with strange warriors having landed on the Gulf Coast near Cempoallan and he dispatched messengers to greet them and find out what was happening, and he ordered his subjects in the area to keep him informed of any new arrivals. In 1519, he was informed of the arrival of the Spanish fleet of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, who soon marched toward Tlaxcala where he allied with the traditional enemies of the Aztecs. On 8 November 1519, Moctezuma II received Cort\u00e9s and his troops and Tlaxcalan allies on the causeway south of Tenochtitlan, and he invited the Spaniards to stay as his guests in Tenochtitlan. When Aztec troops destroyed a Spanish camp on the Gulf Coast, Cort\u00e9s ordered Moctezuma to execute the commanders responsible for the attack, and Moctezuma complied. At this point, the power balance had shifted toward the Spaniards who now held Moctezuma as a prisoner in his palace. As this shift in power became clear to Moctezuma's subjects, the Spaniards became increasingly unwelcome in the capital city, and, in June 1520, hostilities broke out, culminating in the massacre in the Great Temple, and a major uprising of the Mexica against the Spanish. During the fighting, Moctezuma was killed, either by the Spaniards who killed him as they fled the city, or by the Mexica themselves who considered him a traitor.\nCuitl\u00e1huac, a kinsman and adviser to Moctezuma, succeeded him as tlatoani, mounting the defense of Tenochtitlan against the Spanish invaders and their indigenous allies. He ruled for only 80 days, perhaps dying in a smallpox epidemic, although early sources do not give the cause. He was succeeded by Cuauht\u00e9moc, the last independent Mexica tlatoani, who continued the fierce defense of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs were weakened by disease, and the Spanish enlisted tens of thousands of Indian allies, especially Tlaxcalans, for the assault on Tenochtitlan. After the siege and destruction of the Aztec capital, Cuauht\u00e9moc was captured on 13 August 1521, marking the beginning of Spanish hegemony in central Mexico. Spaniards held Cuauht\u00e9moc captive until he was tortured and executed on the orders of Cort\u00e9s, supposedly for treason, during an ill-fated expedition to Honduras in 1525. His death marked the end of a tumultuous era in Aztec political history.\nAfter the fall of the Aztec Empire, entire Nahua communities were subject to forced labor under the \"encomienda\" system, the Aztec education system was abolished and replaced by a very limited church education, and Aztec religious practices were forcibly replaced with Catholicism.\nThe \"Cuauhtlatoque\" and Aztec polity post-conquest (1521\u20131565).\nCuauht\u00e9moc and the deterritorialization of the \"tlatoque\".\nFollowing the Spanish and their indigenous allies' victory over the Triple Alliance, its \"tlatloque\" \u2013 Cuauht\u00e9moc, captured on 13 August 1521 \u2013 was not immediately deposed of his titular throne while in captivity. Rather, the Spanish maintained his nominal, but not actual authority, while they established a foothold in the Valley of Mexico, and understanding thereof. This dynamic also was to avoid ceding control over the Valley to their allies, who neighbored and detested the former Triple Alliance for its historic bellicosity towards them and their peoples. According to Spanish legend only, he requested, upon his and his nobles' surrender, for Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s to execute him by knife, \"strik[ing him] dead immediately\", which Cort\u00e9s supposedly refused, declaring that \"A Spaniard knows how to respect valor, even in an enemy\" and praising Cuauht\u00e9moc for having \"defended [his] capital like a brave warrior\".\nThe account continues that Cort\u00e9s accepted Cuauht\u00e9moc's request to leave the Mexica unharmed. Cort\u00e9s later recanted his obligations upon seeing that the war bounty collected from the conquest did not meet his expectations, and proceeded to torture Cuauht\u00e9moc by forcing him to walk over hot coals, out of the belief that he had attempted to hide more valuables. These valuables would not be recovered to the extent desired by Cort\u00e9s. Cuauht\u00e9moc was forcefully converted to Catholicism, baptised under the new name Fernando Cuauht\u00e9motz\u00edn, relieved of his sovereignty, keeping only the title of \"tlatoani\", and kept under house arrest until his execution \u2013 an event for which there exist numerous contradicting contemporary perspectives, testimonies, and reasonings. There are, however, no Mexica sources describing these events, possibly due to the mass-destruction of indigenous texts during conquest. Cuauht\u00e9moc was the last \"tlatoani\" with full sovereign authority, as well as the last \"tlatoque\" whose title came through to him through dynastic lineage until the throne's dynastic restoration in 1538.\n\"Cu\u0101uhtlahto\u0101ni\" (1525\u20131536).\nIn the period immediately succeeding Cuauht\u00e9moc's deposition, successors were directly installed by the Spanish to facilitate easier control of their new colony. This practice was employed by the Spanish in numerous areas throughout the early stages of conquest. This was to navigate the inherent difficulty in administer a foreign government in an incompletely understood land, whose people at the time were still recovering from war and plagued by European-introduced disease. Additionally, a puppet government served as an attempt to create an image of legitimacy towards the indigenous Mesoamericans. These installed \"tlatoani\" were known as \"Cu\u0101uhtlahto\u0101ni\", meaning \"the one who speaks like eagle\" in N\u00e1huatl, and as appointments, did not undergo the traditional Mexica investiture ceremony pursued with normal \"tlatoani\". This invalidated the \"Cuahtlatoani\"'s authority and right to rule in the eyes of their \"subjects\".\nThe \"Cuauhtlatoani\" were not a novel concept, but had precedent, as the term was used pre-conquest to describe an interim, non-dynastic regent with \"tlatloque\"-like authority. Generally, \"cuauhtlatoani\" would be appointed by \"tlatoani\" to administer recently-conquered lands, such as the \"Atlepetl\" of Tlatelolco following the 1473 defeat of its last Tlatoani \u2013 Moquihuix \u2013 by the Triple Alliance. Tlatelolco was governed by \"cuauhtlatoque\" until the death of Itzquauhtzin in 1520. The term \"cuauhtlatoani\" is also sometimes used in early 16th-century codices to describe the mythic first leaders of the Mexica during their migration from Aztl\u00e1n.\nIn the context of the Spanish conquest, the indigenous population's general view of the \"cuauhtlatoani\" as illegitimate was initially of benefit and preference to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and the Spanish, who saw it as a way of ensuring their appointees would not be seen as a source of allegiance separate from the Spanish crown. Despite their illegitimacy, Mexica codices composed after their reigns would describe \"cuauhtlatoani\" as if they were \"tlatoani\", but differ considerably on perceptions of legitimacy, with some vocally ascribing illegitimacy to their reigns and others remaining silent on the matter entirely, implying continuity with their predecessors.\nThere were three \"cuauhtlatoani\" of Tenochtitlan before the restoration of dynastically-derived rulership to the atlepetl in 1565. These were Tlacotzin (reigned less than a year sometime between 1525 and 1526), who died before even reaching Tenochtitlan, Motelchiuhtzin (1525/1526\u20131530/1531), a Mexica commoner and officer for Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9z, and Xochiquentzin (1532\u20131536), a Mexica commoner who had previously served as \"calpixqui\", a minor administrative palatine officer.\nRestoration of dynastic rulership (1538\u20131565).\n1538 saw the dynastic rulership restored to the throne of Tenochtitlan, still in a dynamic of vassalage to the authority expressed by the conquistadors in the name of the Spanish crown. The reasoning behind this choice is not certain, but it was probably made by the Spanish viceroy of New Spain from 1535 to 1550, Antonio de Mendoza, in pursuit of a more authoritative appearance of legitimacy in regards to Spanish rule over the Mexica. The restoration entailed a revalidation of the role of Mexica nobility in the selection of a \"tlatloque\", where a candidate they elected would be forwarded to the Spanish authority for confirmation and installation. This helped forward an air of authority and responsibility in the eye of the Mexica towards the Spanish and the new \"tlatoani\".\nThis period saw four tlatoani with one \"cuauhtlatoque\" acting to serve in only a transitional role between \"tlatoani\". These were: Huanitzin (1538\u20131541), grandnephew to Moctezuma II \u2013 who was popular amongst the Nahua and was bilingual in Spanish and N\u00e1huatl \u2013 followed by Tehuetzquititzin (1541\u20131554), who was \"de facto\" succeeded by the magistrate of Tenochtitlan, Omacatzin, a commoner from Xochimilco whose authority only served a temporary and transitional buffer between Tehuetzquititzin, and his \"de jure\" successor, Cecetzin (1557\u20131562). The reason for this interregnum and its significant length is, to date, unknown. Cetcetzin was succeeded by Cipac (1563\u20131565), whose reign saw numerous conflicts between him and the Spanish authorities in regards to jurisprudence and taxation \u2013 the stress of which would lead to his early death, as well as the Spanish's decision to continue with direct administration over the remnants of the Triple Alliance through the creation of Spanish-appointed governorships. These governorships would, at least initially, be held by indigenous or mestizo administrators, none of which, however, were dynastically contiguous with the \"tlatloque\".\nSocial and political organization.\nNobles and commoners.\nThe highest class was the \"p\u012bpiltin\" or nobility. The \"pilli\" status was hereditary and ascribed certain privileges to its holders, such as the right to wear particularly fine garments and consume luxury goods, as well as to own land and direct corvee labor by commoners. The most powerful nobles were called lords () and they owned and controlled noble estates or houses, and could serve in the highest government positions or as military leaders. Nobles made up about five percent of the population.\nThe second class was the \"m\u0101cehualtin\", originally peasants, but later extended to the lower working classes in general. Eduardo Noguera estimates that in later stages only 20 percent of the population was dedicated to agriculture and food production. The other 80 percent of society were warriors, artisans, and traders. Eventually, most of the \"m\u0101cehuallis\" were dedicated to arts and crafts. Their works were an important source of income for the city. Macehualtin could become enslaved, () for example if they had to sell themselves into the service of a noble due to debt or poverty, but enslavement was not an inherited status among the Aztecs. Some macehualtin were landless and worked directly for a lord (), whereas the majority of commoners were organized into calpollis which gave them access to land and property.\nCommoners were able to obtain privileges similar to those of the nobles by demonstrating prowess in warfare. When a warrior took a captive he accrued the right to use certain emblems, weapons, or garments, and as he took more captives his rank and prestige increased.\nFamily and gender.\nThe Aztec family pattern was bilateral, counting relatives on the father's and mother's side of the family equally, and inheritance was also passed both to sons and daughters. This meant that women could own property just as men and that women therefore had a good deal of economic freedom from their spouses. Nevertheless, Aztec society was highly gendered with separate gender roles for men and women. Men were expected to work outside of the house, as farmers, traders, craftsmen, and warriors, whereas women were expected to take responsibility for the domestic sphere. Women could however also work outside of the home as small-scale merchants, doctors, priests, and midwives. Warfare was highly valued and a source of high prestige, but women's work was metaphorically conceived of as equivalent to warfare, and as equally important in maintaining the equilibrium of the world and pleasing the gods. This situation has led some scholars to describe Aztec gender ideology as an ideology not of a gender hierarchy, but of gender complementarity, with gender roles being separate but equal.\nAmong the nobles, marriage alliances were often used as a political strategy with lesser nobles marrying daughters from more prestigious lineages whose status was then inherited by their children. Nobles were also often polygamous, with lords having many wives. Polygamy was not very common among the commoners and some sources describe it as being prohibited.\n\"Altepetl\" and \"calpolli\".\nThe main unit of Aztec political organization was the city-state, in Nahuatl called the \"altepetl\", meaning \"water-mountain\". Each altepetl was led by a ruler, a \"tlatoani\", with authority over a group of nobles and a population of commoners. The altepetl included a capital that served as a religious center, the hub of distribution and organization of a local population that often lived spread out in minor settlements surrounding the capital. Altepetl was also the main source of ethnic identity for the inhabitants, even though Altepetl was frequently composed of groups speaking different languages. Each altepetl would see itself as standing in political contrast to other altepetl polities, and war was waged between altepetl states. In this way, Nahuatl-speaking Aztecs of one Altepetl would be solidary with speakers of other languages belonging to the same altepetl, but enemies of Nahuatl speakers belonging to other competing altepetl states. In the basin of Mexico, altepetl was composed of subdivisions called \"calpolli\", which served as the main organizational unit for commoners. In Tlaxcala and the Puebla valley, the altepetl was organized into \"teccalli\" units headed by a lord (), who would hold sway over a territory and distribute rights to land among the commoners. A calpolli was at once a territorial unit where commoners organized labor and land use since the land was not private property, and also often a kinship unit as a network of families that were related through intermarriage. Calpolli leaders might be or become members of the nobility, in which case they could represent their Calpolli interests in the altepetl government.\nIn the valley of Morelos, archeologist Michael E. Smith estimates that a typical altepetl had from 10,000 to 15,000 inhabitants, and covered an area between . In the Morelos Valley, altepetl sizes were somewhat smaller. Smith argues that the altepetl was primarily a political unit, made up of the population with allegiance to a lord, rather than as a territorial unit. He makes this distinction because in some areas minor settlements with different altepetl allegiances were interspersed.\nTriple Alliance and Aztec Empire.\nThe Aztec Empire was ruled by indirect means. Like most European empires, it was ethnically very diverse, but unlike most European empires, it was more of a hegemonic confederacy than a single system of government. Ethnohistorian Ross Hassig has argued that the Aztec empire is best understood as an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands; it merely expected taxes to be paid and exerted force only to the degree it was necessary to ensure the payment of taxes. It was also a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected; for example, the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center. The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city-state was conquered, and the Aztecs did not generally interfere in local affairs as long as the tax payments were made and the local elites participated willingly. Such compliance was secured by establishing and maintaining a network of elites, related through intermarriage and different forms of exchange.\nNevertheless, the expansion of the empire was accomplished through military control of frontier zones, in strategic provinces where a much more direct approach to conquest and control was taken. Such strategic provinces were often exempt from taxation. The Aztecs even invested in those areas, by maintaining a permanent military presence, installing puppet rulers, or even moving entire populations from the center to maintain a loyal base of support. In this way, the Aztec system of government distinguished between different strategies of control in the outer regions of the empire, far from the core in the Valley of Mexico. Some provinces were treated as subject provinces, which provided the basis for economic stability for the empire, and strategic provinces, which were the basis for further expansion.\nAlthough the form of government is often referred to as an empire, most areas within the empire were organized as city-states, known as \"altepetl\" in Nahuatl. These were small polities ruled by a hereditary leader (\"tlatoani\") from a legitimate noble dynasty. The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among \"altepetl\". Even after the confederation of the Triple Alliance was formed in 1427 and began its expansion through conquest, the \"altepetl\" remained the dominant form of organization at the local level. The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire's hegemonic form of control.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture and subsistence.\nLike all Mesoamerican peoples, Aztec society was organized around maize agriculture. The humid environment in the Valley of Mexico with its many lakes and swamps permitted intensive agriculture. The main crops in addition to maize were beans, squashes, chilies, and amaranth. Particularly important for agricultural production in the valley was the construction of chinampas on the lake, artificial islands that allowed the conversion of the shallow waters into highly fertile gardens that could be cultivated year-round. Chinampas are human-made extensions of agricultural land, created from alternating layers of mud from the bottom of the lake, and plant matter and other vegetation. These raised beds were separated by narrow canals, which allowed farmers to move between them by canoe. Chinampas were extremely fertile pieces of land, and yielded, on average, seven crops annually. Based on current chinampa yields, it has been estimated that of chinampa would feed 20 individuals and of \"chinampas\" could feed 180,000.\nThe Aztecs further intensified agricultural production by constructing systems of artificial irrigation. While most of the farming occurred outside the densely populated areas, within the cities there was another method of (small-scale) farming. Each family had a garden plot where they grew maize, fruits, herbs, medicines, and other important plants. When the city of Tenochtitlan became a major urban center, water was supplied to the city through aqueducts from springs on the banks of the lake, and they organized a system that collected human waste for use as fertilizer. Through intensive agriculture, the Aztecs were able to sustain a large urbanized population. The lake was also a rich source of proteins in the form of aquatic animals such as fish, amphibians, shrimp, insects and insect eggs, and waterfowl. The presence of such varied sources of protein meant that there was little use for domestic animals for meat (only turkeys and dogs were kept), and scholars have calculated that there was no shortage of protein among the inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico.\nCrafts and trades.\nThe excess supply of food products allowed a significant portion of the Aztec population to dedicate themselves to trades other than food production. Apart from taking care of domestic food production, women weaved textiles from agave fibers and cotton. Men also engaged in craft specializations such as the production of ceramics and obsidian and flint tools and of luxury goods such as beadwork, featherwork, and the elaboration of tools and musical instruments. Sometimes entire calpollis specialized in a single craft, and in some archeological sites large neighborhoods have been found where- only a single craft specialty was practiced.\nThe Aztecs did not produce much metalwork but did have knowledge of basic smelting technology for gold, and they combined gold with precious stones such as jade and turquoise. Copper products were generally imported from the Tarascans of Michoacan.\nTrade and distribution.\nProducts were distributed through a network of markets; some markets specialized in a single commodity (e.g., the dog market of Acolman), and other general markets with the presence of many different goods. Markets were highly organized with a system of supervisors taking care that only authorized merchants were permitted to sell their goods, and punishing those who cheated their customers or sold substandard or counterfeit goods. A typical town would have a weekly market (every five days), while larger cities held markets every day. Cort\u00e9s reported that the central market of Tlatelolco, Tenochtitlan's sister city, was visited by 60,000 people daily. Some sellers in the markets were petty vendors; farmers might sell some of their produce, potters sold their vessels, and so on. Other vendors were professional merchants who traveled from market to market seeking profits.\nThe pochteca were specialized long-distance merchants organized into exclusive guilds. They made long expeditions to all parts of Mesoamerica bringing back exotic luxury goods, and they served as the judges and supervisors of the Tlatelolco market. Although the economy of Aztec Mexico was commercialized (in its use of money, markets, and merchants), land and labor were not generally commodities for sale, though some types of land could be sold between nobles. In the commercial sector of the economy, several types of money were in regular use. Small purchases were made with cacao beans, which had to be imported from lowland areas. In Aztec marketplaces, a small rabbit was worth 30 beans, a turkey egg cost three beans, and a tamal cost a single bean. For larger purchases, standardized lengths of cotton cloth, called quachtli, were used. There were different grades of quachtli, ranging in value from 65 to 300 cacao beans. About 20 quachtli could support a commoner for one year in Tenochtitlan.\nTaxation.\nAnother form of distribution of goods was through the payment of taxes. When an altepetl was conquered, the victor imposed a yearly tax, usually paid in the form of whichever local product was most valuable or treasured. Several pages from the Codex Mendoza list subject towns along with the goods they supplied, which included not only luxuries such as feathers, adorned suits, and greenstone beads, but more practical goods such as cloth, firewood, and food. Taxes were usually paid twice or four times a year at differing times.\nArchaeological excavations in the Aztec-ruled provinces show that incorporation into the empire had both costs and benefits for provincial peoples. On the positive side, the empire promoted commerce and trade, and exotic goods from obsidian to bronze managed to reach the houses of both commoners and nobles. Trade partners also included the enemy Pur\u00e9pecha (also known as Tarascans), a source of bronze tools and jewelry. On the negative side, imperial taxes imposed a burden on commoner households, who had to increase their work to pay their share of taxes. Nobles, on the other hand, often made out well under the imperial rule because of the indirect nature of imperial organization. The empire had to rely on local kings and nobles and offered them privileges for their help in maintaining order and keeping the tax revenue flowing.\nUrbanism.\nAztec society combined a relatively simple agrarian rural tradition with the development of a truly urbanized society with a complex system of institutions, specializations, and hierarchies. The urban tradition in Mesoamerica was developed during the classic period with major urban centers such as Teotihuacan with a population well above 100,000, and, at the time of the rise of the Aztecs, the urban tradition was ingrained in Mesoamerican society, with urban centers serving major religious, political and economic functions for the entire population.\nMexico-Tenochtitlan.\nThe capital city of the Aztec empire was Tenochtitlan, now the site of modern-day Mexico City. Built on a series of islets in Lake Texcoco, the city plan was based on a symmetrical layout that was divided into four city sections called \"campan\" (directions). Tenochtitlan was built according to a fixed plan and centered on the ritual precinct, where the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan rose above the city. Houses were made of wood and loam, and roofs were made of reed, although pyramids, temples, and palaces were generally made of stone. The city was interlaced with canals, which were useful for transportation. Anthropologist Eduardo Noguera estimated the population at 200,000 based on the house count and merging the population of Tlatelolco (once an independent city, but later became a suburb of Tenochtitlan). If one includes the surrounding islets and shores surrounding Lake Texcoco, estimates range from 300,000 to 700,000 inhabitants. Michael E. Smith gives a somewhat smaller figure of 212,500 inhabitants of Tenochtitlan based on an area of and a population density of 157 inhabitants per hectare (/acre). The second largest city in the valley of Mexico in the Aztec period was Texcoco with some 25,000 inhabitants dispersed over .\nThe center of Tenochtitlan was the sacred precinct, a walled-off square area that housed the Great Temple, temples for other deities, the ballcourt, the calmecac (a school for nobles), a skull rack \"tzompantli,\" displaying the skulls of sacrificial victims, houses of the warrior orders and a merchants palace. Around the sacred precinct were the royal palaces built by the tlatoanis.\nThe Great Temple.\nThe centerpiece of Tenochtitlan was the Templo Mayor, the Great Temple, a large stepped pyramid with a double staircase leading up to two twin shrines \u2013 one dedicated to Tlaloc, the other to Huitzilopochtli. This was where most of the human sacrifices were carried out during the ritual festivals and the bodies of sacrificial victims were thrown down the stairs. The temple was enlarged in several stages, and most of the Aztec rulers made a point of adding a further stage, each with a new dedication and inauguration. The temple has been excavated in the center of Mexico City and the rich dedicatory offerings are displayed in the Museum of the Templo Mayor.\nArcheologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma, in his essay \"Symbolism of the Templo Mayor\", posits that the orientation of the temple is indicative of the totality of the vision the Mexica had of the universe (cosmovision). He states that the \"principal center, or navel, where the horizontal and vertical planes intersect, that is, the point from which the heavenly or upper plane and the plane of the Underworld begin and the four directions of the universe originate, is the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan\". Matos Moctezuma supports his supposition by claiming that the temple acts as an embodiment of a living myth where \"all sacred power is concentrated and where all the levels intersect\".\nOther major city-states.\nOther major Aztec cities were some of the previous city-state centers around the lake including Tenayuca, Azcapotzalco, Texcoco, Colhuacan, Tlacopan, Chapultepec, Coyoacan, Xochimilco, and Chalco. In the Puebla Valley, Cholula was the largest city with the largest pyramid temple in Mesoamerica, while the confederacy of Tlaxcala consisted of four smaller cities. In Morelos, Cuahnahuac was a major city of the Nahuatl-speaking Tlahuica tribe, and Tollocan in the Toluca Valley was the capital of the Matlatzinca tribe which included Nahuatl speakers as well as speakers of Otomi and the language today called Matlatzinca. Most Aztec cities had a similar layout with a central plaza with a major pyramid with two staircases and a double temple oriented toward the west.\nReligion.\nNahuas' metaphysics centers around , \"a single, dynamic, vivifying, eternally self-generating and self-regenerating sacred power, energy or force.\" This is conceptualized in a kind of monistic pantheism as manifest in the supreme god , as well as a large pantheon of lesser gods and idealizations of natural phenomena such as stars and fire. Priests and educated upper classes held more monistic views, while the popular religion of the uneducated tended to embrace the polytheistic and mythological aspects.\nIn common with many other indigenous Mesoamerican civilizations, the Aztecs put great ritual emphasis on calendrics, and scheduled festivals, government ceremonies, and even war around key transition dates in the Aztec calendar. Public ritual practices could involve food, storytelling, and dance, as well as ceremonial warfare, the Mesoamerican ballgame, and human sacrifice, as a manner of payment for, or even effecting, the continuation of the days and the cycle of life.\nDeities.\nThe four main deities worshiped by the Aztecs were Tlaloc, Huitzilopochtli, Quetzalcoatl, and Tezcatlipoca. Tlaloc is a rain and storm deity; Huitzilopochtli, a solar and martial deity and the tutelary deity of the Mexica tribe; Quetzalcoatl, a wind, sky, and star deity and cultural hero; and Tezcatlipoca, a deity of the night, magic, prophecy, and fate. The Great Temple in Tenochtitlan had two shrines on its top, one dedicated to Tlaloc, the other to Huitzilopochtli. The two shrines represented two sacred mountains: the left one was Tonacatepetl, the Hill of Sustenance, whose patron god was Tlaloc, and the right one was Coatepec, whose patron god was Huitzilopochtli. Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca each had separate temples within the religious precinct close to the Great Temple, and the high priests of the Great Temple were named \"Quetzalcoatl Tlamacazqueh\". Other major deities were Tlaltecutli or Coatlicue (a female earth deity); the deity couple Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl (associated with life and sustenance); Mictlantecutli and Mictlancihuatl, a male and female couple of deities that represented the underworld and death; Chalchiutlicue (a female deity of lakes and springs); Xipe Totec (a deity of fertility and the natural cycle); Huehueteotl or Xiuhtecuhtli (a fire god); Tlazolteotl (a female deity tied to childbirth and sexuality); and Xochipilli and Xochiquetzal (gods of song, dance and games). In some regions, particularly Tlaxcala, Mixcoatl or Camaxtli was the main tribal deity. A few sources mention a binary deity, Ometeotl, who may have been a god of the duality between life and death, male and female, and who may have incorporated Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl. Some historians argue against the notion that Ometeotl was a dual god, claiming that scholars are applying their preconceived ideas onto translated texts. Apart from the major deities, there were dozens of minor deities each associated with an element or concept, and as the Aztec empire grew so did their pantheon because they adopted and incorporated the local deities of conquered people into their own. Additionally, the major gods had many alternative manifestations or aspects, creating small families of gods with related aspects.\nMythology and worldview.\nAztec mythology is known from many sources written down in the colonial period. One set of myths, called Legend of the Suns, describes the creation of four successive suns, or periods, each ruled by a different deity and inhabited by a different group of beings. Each period ends in a cataclysmic destruction that sets the stage for the next period to begin. In this process, the deities Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl appear as adversaries, each destroying the creations of the other. The current Sun, the fifth, was created when a minor deity sacrificed himself on a bonfire and turned into the sun, but the sun only begins to move once the other deities sacrifice themselves and offer it their life force.\nIn another myth of how the earth was created, Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl appear as allies, defeating a giant crocodile Cipactli, and requiring her to become the earth, allowing humans to carve into her flesh and plant their seeds, on the condition that in return they will offer blood to her. In the story of the creation of humanity, Quetzalcoatl travels with his twin Xolotl to the underworld and brings back bones which are then ground like corn on a metate by the goddess Cihuacoatl, the resulting dough is given human form and comes to life when Quetzalcoatl imbues it with his blood.\nHuitzilopochtli is the deity tied to the Mexica tribe and he figures in the story of the origin and migrations of the tribe. On their journey, Huitzilopochtli, in the form of a deity bundle carried by the Mexica priest, continuously spurs the tribe by pushing them into conflict with their neighbors whenever they are settled in a place. In another myth, Huitzilopochtli defeats and dismembers his sister the lunar deity Coyolxauhqui, and her four hundred brothers at the hill of Coatepetl. The southern side of the Great Temple, also called Coatepetl, was a representation of this myth, and at the foot of the stairs lay a large stone monolith carved with a representation of the dismembered goddess.\nCalendar.\nAztec religious life was organized around the calendars. Like most Mesoamerican people, the Aztecs used two calendars simultaneously: a ritual calendar of 260 days called the \"tonalpohualli\" and a solar calendar of 365 days called the \"xiuhpohualli\". Each day had a name and number in both calendars, and the combination of two dates was unique within 52 years. The tonalpohualli was mostly used for divinatory purposes and it consisted of 20-day signs and number coefficients of 1\u201313 that cycled in a fixed order. The \"xiuhpohualli\" was made up of 18 \"months\" of 20 days, and with a remainder of five \"void\" days at the end of a cycle before the new \"xiuhpohualli\" cycle began. Each 20-day month was named after the specific ritual festival that began the month, many of which contained a relation to the agricultural cycle. Whether, and how, the Aztec calendar was corrected for leap year is a matter of discussion among specialists. The monthly rituals involved the entire population as rituals were performed in each household, in the \"calpolli\" temples, and the main sacred precinct. Many festivals involved different forms of dancing, as well as the reenactment of mythical narratives by deity impersonators and the offering of sacrifice, in the form of food, animals, and human victims.\nEvery 52 years, the two calendars reached their shared starting point and a new calendar cycle began. This calendar event was celebrated with a ritual known as \"Xiuhmolpilli\" or the New Fire Ceremony. In this ceremony, old pottery was broken in all homes and all fires in the Aztec realm were put out. Then a new fire was drilled over the breast of a sacrificial victim and runners brought the new fire to the different \"calpolli\" communities where fire was redistributed to each home. The night without fire was associated with the fear that star demons, \"tzitzimimeh\", might descend and devour the earth \u2013 ending the fifth period of the sun.\nHuman sacrifice and cannibalism.\nTo the Aztecs, death was instrumental in the perpetuation of creation, and gods and humans alike had the responsibility of sacrificing themselves to allow life to continue. As described in the myth of creation above, humans were understood to be responsible for the sun's continued revival, as well as for paying the earth for its continued fertility. Blood sacrifice in various forms was conducted. Both humans and animals were sacrificed, depending on the god to be placated and the ceremony being conducted, and priests of some gods were sometimes required to provide their blood through self-mutilation. It is known that some rituals included acts of cannibalism, with the captor and his family consuming part of the flesh of their sacrificed captives, but it is not known how widespread this practice was.\nWhile human sacrifice was practiced throughout Mesoamerica, the Aztecs, according to their accounts, brought this practice to an unprecedented level. For example, for the reconsecration of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, Aztec and Spanish sources later said that 80,400 prisoners were sacrificed over four days, reportedly by Ahuitzotl, the Great Speaker himself. This number, however, is considered by many scholars as wildly exaggerated. Other estimates place the number of human sacrifices at between 1,000 and 20,000 annually.\nThe scale of Aztec human sacrifice has provoked many scholars to consider what may have been the driving factor behind this aspect of Aztec religion. In the 1970s, Michael Harner and Marvin Harris argued that the motivation behind human sacrifice among the Aztecs was the cannibalization of the sacrificial victims, depicted for example in \"Codex Magliabechiano\". Harner claimed that very high population pressure and an emphasis on maize agriculture, without domesticated herbivores, led to a deficiency of essential amino acids among the Aztecs. While there is universal agreement that the Aztecs practiced sacrifice, there is a lack of scholarly consensus as to whether cannibalism was widespread. Harris, the author of \"Cannibals and Kings\" (1977), has propagated the claim, originally proposed by Harner, that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins. These claims have been refuted by Bernard Ort\u00edz Montellano who, in his studies of Aztec health, diet, and medicine, demonstrates that while the Aztec diet was low in animal proteins, it was rich in vegetable proteins. Ortiz also points to the preponderance of human sacrifice during periods of food abundance following harvests compared to periods of food scarcity, the insignificant quantity of human protein available from sacrifices, and the fact that aristocrats already had easy access to animal protein. Today, many scholars point to ideological explanations of the practice, noting how the public spectacle of sacrificing warriors from conquered states was a major display of political power, supporting the claim of the ruling classes to divine authority. It also served as an important deterrent against rebellion by subjugated polities against the Aztec state, and such deterrents were crucial for the loosely organized empire to cohere.\nArt and cultural production.\nThe Aztecs greatly appreciated the \"toltecayotl\" (arts and fine craftsmanship) of the Toltecs, who predated the Aztecs in central Mexico. The Aztecs considered Toltec productions to represent the finest state of culture. The fine arts included writing and painting, singing and composing poetry, carving sculptures and producing mosaics, making fine ceramics, producing complex featherwork, and working metals, including copper and gold. Artisans of the fine arts were referred to collectively as \"tolteca\" (Toltec).\nWriting and iconography.\nThe Aztecs did not have a fully developed writing system like the Maya; however, like the Maya and Zapotec, they did use a writing system that combined logographic signs with phonetic syllable signs. Logograms would, for example, be the use of an image of a mountain to signify the word \"tepetl,\" \"mountain\", whereas a phonetic syllable sign would be the use of an image of a tooth \"tlantli\" to signify the syllable \"tla\" in words unrelated to teeth. The combination of these principles allowed the Aztecs to represent the sounds of names of persons and places. Narratives tended to be represented through sequences of images, using various iconographic conventions such as footprints to show paths, temples on fire to show conquest events, etc.\nEpigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has demonstrated that the different syllable signs used by the Aztecs almost enabled the representation of all the most frequent syllables of the Nahuatl language (with some notable exceptions), but some scholars have argued that such a high degree of phonetics was only achieved after the conquest when the Aztecs had been introduced to the principles of phonetic writing by the Spanish. Other scholars, notably Gordon Whittaker, have argued that the syllabic and phonetic aspects of Aztec writing were considerably less systematic and more creative than Lacadena's proposal suggests, arguing that Aztec writing never coalesced into a strictly syllabic system such as the Maya writing, but rather used a wide range of different types of phonetic signs.\nThe image to the right demonstrates the use of phonetic signs for writing place names in the colonial Aztec Codex Mendoza. The uppermost place is \"Mapachtepec\", meaning literally \"Hill of the Raccoon\", but the glyph includes the phonetic prefixes \"ma\" (hand) and \"pach\" (moss) over a mountain \"tepetl\" spelling the word \"mapach\" (\"raccoon\") phonetically instead of logographically. The other two place names, \"Mazatlan\" (\"Place of Many Deer\") and \"Huitztlan\" (\"Place of many thorns\") use the phonetic element \"tlan\" represented by a tooth (\"tlantli\") combined with a deer head to spell \"maza\" (\"mazatl\" = deer) and a thorn (\"huitztli\") to spell \"huitz\".\nMusic, song and poetry.\nSong and poetry were highly regarded; there were presentations and poetry contests at most of the Aztec festivals. There were also dramatic presentations that included players, musicians, and acrobats. There were several different genres of \"cuicatl\" (song): \"Yaocuicatl\" was devoted to war and the god(s) of war, \"Teocuicatl\" to the gods and creation myths and adoration of said figures, \"xochicuicatl\" to flowers (a symbol of poetry itself and indicative of the highly metaphorical nature of poetry that often used duality to convey multiple layers of meaning). \"Prose\" was \"tlahtolli\", also with its different categories and divisions.\nA key aspect of Aztec poetics was the use of parallelism, using a structure of embedded couplets to express different perspectives on the same element. Some such couplets were diphrasisms, conventional metaphors whereby an abstract concept was expressed metaphorically by using two more concrete concepts. For example, the Nahuatl expression for \"poetry\" was \"in xochitl in cuicatl\" a dual term meaning \"the flower, the song\".\nA remarkable amount of this poetry survives, having been collected during the era of the conquest. In some cases poetry is attributed to individual authors, such as Nezahualcoyotl, \"tlatoani\" of Texcoco, and Cuacuauhtzin, Lord of Tepechpan, but whether these attributions reflect actual authorship is a matter of opinion. An important collection of such poems is \"Romances de los se\u00f1ores de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a\", collected (Tezcoco 1582), probably by Juan Bautista de Pomar, and the \"Cantares Mexicanos\". Both men and women were poets in Aztec society, illustrating pre-Hispanic Mexico's gender parallelism in upper-class society. One famous female poet is Macuilxochitzin, whose work primarily focused on the Aztec conquest. \nCeramics.\nThe Aztecs produced ceramics of different types. Common are orange wares, which are orange or buff burnished ceramics with no slip. Red wares are ceramics with a reddish slip. Polychrome ware is ceramics with a white or orange slip, with painted designs in orange, red, brown, and/or black. Very common is \"black on orange\" ware which is orange ware decorated with painted designs in black.\nAztec black-on-orange ceramics are chronologically classified into four phases: Aztec I and II corresponding to c. 1100\u20131350 (early Aztec period), Aztec III (c. 1350\u20131520), and the last phase Aztec IV was the early colonial period. Aztec I is characterized by floral designs and day-name glyphs; Aztec II is characterized by a stylized grass design above calligraphic designs such as S-curves or loops; Aztec III is characterized by very simple line designs; Aztec IV continues some pre-Columbian designs but adds European influenced floral designs. There were local variations on each of these styles, and archeologists continue to refine the ceramic sequence.\nTypical vessels for everyday use were clay griddles for cooking (\"comalli\"), bowls and plates for eating (\"caxitl\"), pots for cooking (\"comitl\"), molcajetes or mortar-type vessels with slashed bases for grinding chilli (\"molcaxitl\"), and different kinds of braziers, tripod dishes, and biconical goblets. Vessels were fired in simple updraft kilns or even in open firing in pit kilns at low temperatures. Polychrome ceramics were imported from the Cholula region (also known as Mixteca-Puebla style), and these wares were highly prized as a luxury ware, whereas the local black on orange styles were also for everyday use.\nPainted art.\nAztec painted art was produced on animal skin (mostly deer), on cotton lienzos, and amate paper made from bark (e.g., from \"Trema micrantha\" or \"Ficus aurea\"), it was also produced on ceramics and carved in wood and stone. The surface of the material was often first treated with gesso to make the images stand out more clearly. The art of painting and writing was known in Nahuatl by the metaphor \"in tlilli, in tlapalli\" \u2013 meaning \"the black ink, the red pigment\".\nThere are few extant Aztec-painted books. Of these, none are conclusively confirmed to have been created before the conquest, but several codices must have been painted either right before the conquest or very soon after \u2013 before traditions for producing them were much disturbed. Even if some codices may have been produced after the conquest, there is good reason to think that they may have been copied from pre-Columbian originals by scribes. The Codex Borbonicus is considered by some to be the only extant Aztec codex produced before the conquest \u2013 it is a calendric codex describing the day and month counts indicating the patron deities of the different periods. Others consider it to have stylistic traits suggesting a post-conquest production.\nSome codices were produced post-conquest, sometimes commissioned by the colonial government, for example, Codex Mendoza, were painted by Aztec \"tlacuilos\" (codex creators), but under the control of Spanish authorities, who also sometimes commissioned codices describing pre-colonial religious practices, for example, Codex R\u00edos. After the conquest, codices with calendric or religious information were sought out and systematically destroyed by the church \u2013 whereas other types of painted books, particularly historical narratives, and tax lists continued to be produced. Although depicting Aztec deities and describing religious practices also shared by the Aztecs of the Valley of Mexico, the codices produced in Southern Puebla near Cholula, are sometimes not considered to be Aztec codices, because they were produced outside of the Aztec \"heartland\". Karl Anton Nowotny, nevertheless considered that the Codex Borgia, painted in the area around Cholula and using a Mixtec style, was the \"most significant work of art among the extant manuscripts\".\nThe first Aztec murals were from Teotihuacan. Most of our current Aztec murals were found in Templo Mayor. The Aztec capital was decorated with elaborate murals. In Aztec murals, humans are represented like they are represented in the codices. One mural discovered in Tlateloco depicts an old man and an old woman. This may represent the gods Cipactonal and Oxomico.\nSculpture.\nSculptures were carved in stone and wood, but few wood carvings have survived. Aztec stone sculptures exist in many sizes from small figurines and masks to large monuments, and are characterized by a high quality of craftsmanship. Many sculptures were carved in highly realistic styles, for example realistic sculpture of animals.\nIn Aztec artwork some monumental stone sculptures have been preserved, such sculptures usually functioned as adornments for religious architecture. Particularly famous monumental rock sculpture includes the so-called Aztec \"Sunstone\" or Calendarstone discovered in 1790; also discovered in 1790 excavations of the Z\u00f3calo was the Coatlicue statue made of andesite, representing a serpentine chthonic goddess with a skirt made of rattlesnakes. The Coyolxauhqui Stone representing the dismembered goddess Coyolxauhqui, found in 1978, was at the foot of the staircase leading up to the Great Temple in Tenochtitlan. Two important types of sculpture are unique to the Aztecs, and related to the context of ritual sacrifice: the \"cuauhxicalli\" or \"eagle vessel\", large stone bowls often shaped like eagles or jaguars used as a receptacle for extracted human hearts; the \"temalacatl\", a monumental carved stone disk to which war captives were tied and sacrificed in a form of gladiatorial combat. The most well-known examples of this type of sculpture are the Stone of Tizoc and the Stone of Motecuzoma I, both carved with images of warfare and conquest by specific Aztec rulers. Many smaller stone sculptures depicting deities also exist. The style used in religious sculpture was rigid stances likely meant to create a powerful experience for the onlooker. Although Aztec stone sculptures are now displayed in museums as unadorned rock, they were originally painted in vivid polychrome color, sometimes covered first with a base coat of plaster. Early Spanish conquistador accounts also describe stone sculptures as having been decorated with precious stones and metal, inserted into the plaster.\nFeatherwork.\nAn especially prized art form among the Aztecs was featherwork \u2013 the creation of intricate and colorful mosaics of feathers, and their use in garments as well as decoration on weaponry, war banners, and warrior suits. The class of highly skilled and honored craftsmen who created feather objects was called the \"amanteca\", named after the \"Amantla\" neighborhood in Tenochtitlan where they lived and worked. They did not pay taxes nor were required to perform public service. The Florentine Codex gives information about how feather works were created. The amanteca had two ways of creating their works. One was to secure the feathers in place using agave cords for three-dimensional objects such as fly whisks, fans, bracelets, headgear, and other objects. The second and more difficult was a mosaic-type technique, which the Spanish also called \"feather painting\". These were done principally on feather shields and cloaks for idols. Feather mosaics were arrangements of minute fragments of feathers from a wide variety of birds, generally worked on a paper base, made from cotton and paste, then itself backed with amate paper, but bases of other types of paper and directly on amate were done as well. These works were done in layers with \"common\" feathers, dyed feathers, and precious feathers. First, a model was made with lower-quality feathers and the precious feathers were found only on the top layer. The adhesive for the feathers in the Mesoamerican period was made from orchid bulbs. Feathers from local and faraway sources were used, especially in the Aztec Empire. The feathers were obtained from wild birds as well as from domesticated turkeys and ducks, with the finest quetzal feathers coming from Chiapas, Guatemala, and Honduras. These feathers were obtained through trade and taxes. Due to the difficulty of conserving feathers, fewer than ten pieces of original Aztec featherwork exist today.\nColonial period, 1521\u20131821.\nMexico City was built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan, gradually replacing and covering the lake, the island and the architecture of Aztec Tenochtitlan. After the fall of Tenochtitlan, Aztec warriors were enlisted as auxiliary troops alongside the Spanish Tlaxcalteca allies, and Aztec forces participated in all of the subsequent campaigns of conquest in northern and southern Mesoamerica. This meant that aspects of Aztec culture and the Nahuatl language continued to expand during the early colonial period as Aztec auxiliary forces made permanent settlements in many of the areas that were put under the Spanish crown.\nThe Aztec ruling dynasty continued to govern San Juan Tenochtitlan, a division of the Spanish capital of Mexico City, but the subsequent indigenous rulers were mostly puppets installed by the Spanish. One was Andr\u00e9s de Tapia Motelchiuh, who was appointed by the Spanish. Other former Aztec city states likewise were established as colonial indigenous towns, governed by a local indigenous \"gobernador\". This office was often initially held by the hereditary indigenous ruling line, with the \"gobernador\" being the tlatoani, but the two positions in many Nahua towns became separated over time. Indigenous governors were in charge of the colonial political organization of the Indians. In particular, they enabled the continued functioning of the tax and enslavement of indigenous commoners to benefit the Spanish encomenderos. Encomenderos owned \"encomiendas\", large tracts of agricultural land on which the encomenderos and their slaves lived. The Spanish coerced the tribes into granting them private ownership of indigenous people and land for enslavement and encomiendas. Occasionally, an Indigenous individual benefited from this system and grew into substantial wealth and power come the colonial period.\nPopulation decline.\nAfter the arrival of the Europeans in Mexico and the conquest, indigenous populations declined significantly. This was largely the result of the epidemics of viruses brought to the continent against which the natives had no immunity. In 1520\u20131521, an outbreak of smallpox swept through the population of Tenochtitlan and was decisive in the fall of the city; further significant epidemics struck in 1545 and 1576.\nThere has been no consensus about the population size of Mexico at the time of European arrival. Early estimates gave very small population figures for the Valley of Mexico, in 1942 Kubler estimated a figure of 200,000. In 1963 Borah and Cook used preconquest tax lists to calculate the number of residents in central Mexico, estimating over 18\u201330 million. Their very high figure has been highly criticized for relying on unwarranted assumptions. Archeologist William Sanders based an estimate on archeological evidence of dwellings, arriving at an estimate of 1\u20131.2 million inhabitants in the Valley of Mexico. Whitmore used a computer simulation model based on colonial censuses to arrive at an estimate of 1.5 million for the Basin in 1519, and an estimate of 16 million for all of Mexico. Depending on the estimations of the population in 1519 the scale of the decline in the 16th century, range from around 50 percent to around 90 percent \u2013 with Sanders's and Whitmore's estimates being around 90 percent.\nSocial and political continuity and change.\nAlthough the Aztec empire fell, some of its highest elites continued to hold elite status in the colonial era. The principal heirs of Moctezuma II and their descendants retained high status. His son Pedro Moctezuma produced a son, who married into the Spanish aristocracy and a further generation saw the creation of the title Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo. From 1696 to 1701, the Viceroy of Mexico held the title of Count of Moctezuma. In 1766, the holder of the title became a Grandee of Spain. In 1865, (during the Second Mexican Empire) the title, which was held by Antonio Mar\u00eda Moctezuma-Marcilla de Teruel y Navarro, 14th Count of Moctezuma de Tultengo, was elevated to that of a Duke, thus becoming Duke of Moctezuma, with \"de Tultengo\" again added in 1992 by Juan Carlos I. Two of Moctezuma's daughters, Do\u00f1a Isabel Moctezuma and her younger sister, Do\u00f1a Leonor Moctezuma, were granted extensive \"encomiendas\" in perpetuity by Hern\u00e1n Cortes.\nThe Nahua peoples, just like other Mesoamerican peoples in colonial New Spain, were able to maintain many aspects of their social and political structure under colonial rule. The basic division the Spanish made was between the Indigenous populations, organized under the \"Rep\u00fablica de indios\", which was separate from the Hispanic sphere, the \"Rep\u00fablica de espa\u00f1oles\". The \"Rep\u00fablica de espa\u00f1oles\" included not just Europeans, but also Africans and mixed-race castas. The Spanish recognized the indigenous elites as nobles in the Spanish colonial system, maintaining the status distinction of the preconquest era, and used these noblemen as intermediaries between the Spanish colonial government and their communities. This was contingent on their conversion to Christianity and loyalty to the Spanish crown. Colonial Nahua polities had considerable autonomy to regulate their local affairs. The Spanish rulers did not entirely understand the indigenous political organization, but they recognized the importance of the existing system and their elite rulers. They reshaped the political system utilizing \"altepetl\" or city-states as the basic unit of governance. In the colonial era, \"altepetl\" was renamed \"cabeceras\" or \"head towns\" (although they often retained the term \"altepetl\" in local-level, Nahuatl-language documentation), with outlying settlements governed by the \"cabeceras\" named \"sujetos\", subject communities. In \"cabeceras\", the Spanish created Iberian-style town councils, or \"cabildos\", which usually continued to function as the elite ruling group had in the Preconquest era. Population decline due to epidemic disease resulted in many population shifts in settlement patterns and the formation of new population centers. These were often forced resettlements under the Spanish policy of \"congregaci\u00f3n\". Indigenous populations living in sparsely populated areas were resettled to form new communities, making it easier for them to be brought within range of evangelization efforts, and easier for the colonial state to exploit their labor.\nLegacy.\nAztec archeological sites are excavated and opened to the public and their artifacts are prominently displayed in museums. Place names and loanwords from the Aztec language Nahuatl permeate the Mexican landscape and vocabulary, and Aztec symbols and mythology have been promoted by the Mexican government and integrated into contemporary Mexican nationalism as emblems of the country.\nDuring the 19th century, the image of the Aztecs as uncivilized barbarians was replaced with romanticized visions of the Aztecs as original sons of the soil, with a highly developed culture rivaling the ancient European civilizations. When Mexico became independent from Spain, a romanticized version of the Aztecs became a source of images that could be used to ground the new nation as a unique blend of European and American.\nAztecs and Mexico's national identity.\nAztec culture and history have been central to the formation of a Mexican national identity after Mexican independence in 1821. In 17th and 18th century Europe, the Aztecs were generally described as barbaric, gruesome, and culturally inferior. Even before Mexico achieved its independence, American-born Spaniards (\"criollos\") drew on Aztec history to ground their search for symbols of local pride, separate from that of Spain. Intellectuals used Aztec writings, such as those collected by Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, and writings of Hernando Alvarado Tezozomoc, and Chimalpahin to understand Mexico's past. This search became the basis for what historian D.A. Brading calls \"creole patriotism\". Seventeenth-century cleric and scientist, Carlos de Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora acquired the manuscript collection of Texcocan nobleman Alva Ixtlilxochitl. Creole Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero published \"La Historia Antigua de M\u00e9xico\" (1780\u20131781) in his Italian exile following the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767, in which he traces the history of the Aztecs from their migration to the last Aztec ruler, Cuauhtemoc. He wrote it expressly to defend Mexico's indigenous past against the slanders of contemporary writers, such as Pauw, Buffon, Raynal, and William Robertson. Archeological excavations in 1790 in the capital's main square uncovered two massive stone sculptures, buried immediately after the fall of Tenochtitlan in the conquest. Unearthed were the famous calendar stone, as well as a statue of Coatlicue. Antonio de Le\u00f3n y Gama's 1792 \"Descripci\u00f3n hist\u00f3rico y cronol\u00f3gico de las dos piedras\" examines the two stone monoliths. A decade later, German scientist Alexander von Humboldt spent a year in Mexico. One of his early publications from that period was \"Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas\". Humboldt was important in disseminating images of the Aztecs to scientists and general readers in the Western world.\nIn the realm of religion, late colonial paintings of the Virgin of Guadalupe have examples of her depicted floating above the iconic nopal cactus of the Aztecs. Juan Diego, the Nahua to whom the apparition was said to appear, links the dark Virgin to Mexico's Aztec past.\nWhen New Spain achieved independence in 1821 and became a monarchy, the First Mexican Empire, its flag had the traditional Aztec eagle on a nopal cactus. This emblem has also been adopted as Mexico's national coat of arms, and is emblazoned on official buildings, seals, and signs. Tensions within post-independence Mexico pitted those rejecting the ancient civilizations of Mexico as a source of national pride, the \"Hispanistas\", mostly politically conservative Mexican elites, and those who saw them as a source of pride, the \"Indigenistas\", who were mostly liberal Mexican elites. Although the flag of the Mexican Republic had the symbol of the Aztecs as its central element, conservative elites were generally hostile to the current indigenous populations of Mexico or crediting them with a glorious pre-Hispanic history. Under Mexican President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, pro-indigenist Mexican intellectuals did not find a wide audience. With Santa Anna's overthrow in 1854, Mexican liberals and scholars interested in the indigenous past became more active. Liberals were more favorably inclined toward the Indigenous populations and their history, but considered a pressing matter being the \"Indian Problem\". Liberals' commitment to equality before the law meant that for upwardly mobile Indigenous, such as Zapotec Benito Ju\u00e1rez, who rose in the ranks of the liberals to become Mexico's first president of Indigenous origins, and Nahua intellectual and politician Ignacio Altamirano, a disciple of Ignacio Ram\u00edrez, a defender of the rights of the indigenous, liberalism presented a way forward in that era. For investigations of Mexico's indigenous past, however, the role of moderate liberal Jos\u00e9 Fernando Ram\u00edrez is important, serving as director of the National Museum and doing research utilizing codices, while staying out of the fierce conflicts between liberals and conservatives that led to a decade of civil war. Mexican scholars who pursued research on the Aztecs in the late 19th century were , , Manuel Orozco y Berra, Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta, and Francisco del Paso y Troncoso contributing significantly to the 19th-century development of Mexican scholarship on the Aztecs.\nThe late 19th century in Mexico was a period in which Aztec civilization became a point of national pride. The era was dominated by liberal military hero, Porfirio D\u00edaz, a mestizo from Oaxaca who was president of Mexico from 1876 to 1911. His policies opening Mexico to foreign investors and modernizing the country under a firm hand controlling unrest, \"Order and Progress\", undermined Mexico's indigenous populations and their communities. However, for investigations of Mexico's ancient civilizations, his was a benevolent regime, with funds supporting archeological research and for protecting monuments. \"Scholars found it more profitable to confine their attention to Indians who had been dead for a number of centuries.\" His benevolence saw the placement of a monument to Cuauhtemoc in a major traffic roundabout (\"glorieta\") of the wide Paseo de la Reforma, which he inaugurated in 1887. In world fairs of the late 19th century, Mexico's pavilions included a major focus on its indigenous past, especially the Aztecs. Mexican scholars such as Alfredo Chavero helped shape the cultural image of Mexico at these exhibitions. \nThe Mexican Revolution (1910\u20131920) and the significant participation of Indigenous people in the struggle in many regions, ignited a broad government-sponsored political and cultural movement of \"indigenismo\", with symbols of Mexico's Aztec past becoming ubiquitous, most especially in Mexican muralism of Diego Rivera.\nIn their works, Mexican authors such as Octavio Paz and Agustin Fuentes have analyzed the use of Aztec symbols by the modern Mexican state, critiquing the way it adopts and adapts indigenous culture to political ends, yet they have also in their works made use of the symbolic idiom themselves. Paz for example critiqued the architectural layout of the National Museum of Anthropology, which constructs a view of Mexican history as culminating with the Aztecs, as an expression of a nationalist appropriation of Aztec culture.\nAztec history and international scholarship.\nScholars in Europe and the United States increasingly wanted investigations into Mexico's ancient civilizations, starting in the nineteenth century. Humboldt had been extremely important in bringing ancient Mexico into broader scholarly discussions of ancient civilizations. French Americanist Charles \u00c9tienne Brasseur de Bourbourg (1814\u20131874) asserted that \"science in our own time has at last effectively studied and rehabilitated America and the Americans from the [previous] viewpoint of history and archeology. It was Humboldt [...] who woke us from our sleep.\" Frenchman Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Waldeck published \"Voyage pittoresque et arch\u00e9ologique dans la province d'Yucatan pendant les ann\u00e9es 1834 et 1836\" in 1838. Although not directly connected with the Aztecs, it contributed to the increased interest in ancient Mexican studies in Europe. English aristocrat Lord Kingsborough spent considerable energy in their pursuit of understanding ancient Mexico. Kingsborough answered Humboldt's call for the publication of all known Mexican codices, publishing nine volumes of \"Antiquities of Mexico\" (1831\u20131846) that were richly illustrated, bankrupting him. He was not directly interested in the Aztecs, but rather in proving that Mexico had been colonized by Jews. However, his publication of these valuable primary sources gave others access to them.\nIn the United States in the early 19th century, interest in ancient Mexico propelled John Lloyd Stephens to travel to Mexico and then publish well-illustrated accounts in the early 1840s. The research of a half-blind Bostonian, William Hickling Prescott, into the Spanish conquest of Mexico, resulted in his highly popular and deeply researched \"The Conquest of Mexico\" (1843). Although not formally trained as a historian, Prescott drew on the obvious Spanish sources, but also Ixtlilxochitl and Sahag\u00fan's history of the conquest. His resulting work was a mixture of pro- and anti-Aztec attitudes. It was not only a bestseller in English, but it also influenced Mexican intellectuals, including the leading conservative politician, Lucas Alam\u00e1n. Alam\u00e1n pushed back against his characterization of the Aztecs. In the assessment of Benjamin Keen, Prescott's history \"has survived attacks from every quarter, and still dominates the conceptions of the laymen, if not the specialist, concerning Aztec civilization\". In the later 19th century, businessman and historian Hubert Howe Bancroft oversaw a huge project, employing writers and researchers, to write the history the \"Native Races\" of North America, including Mexico, California, and Central America. One entire work was devoted to ancient Mexico, half of which concerned the Aztecs. It was a work of synthesis drawing on Ixtlilxochitl and Brasseur de Bourbourg, among others.\nWhen the International Congress of Americanists was formed in Nancy, France in 1875, Mexican scholars became active participants, and Mexico City hosted the biennial multidisciplinary meeting six times, starting in 1895. Mexico's ancient civilizations have continued to be the focus of major scholarly investigations by Mexican and international scholars.\nLanguage and placenames.\nThe Nahuatl language is today spoken by 1.5 million people, mostly in mountainous areas in the states of central Mexico. Mexican Spanish today incorporates hundreds of loans from Nahuatl, and many of these words have passed into general Spanish use, and further into other world languages.\nIn Mexico, Aztec place names are ubiquitous, particularly in central Mexico where the Aztec empire was centered, but also in other regions where many towns, cities, and regions were established under their Nahuatl names, as Aztec auxiliary troops accompanied the Spanish colonizers on the early expeditions that mapped New Spain. In this way even towns, that were not originally Nahuatl speaking came to be known by their Nahuatl names. In Mexico City there are commemorations of Aztec rulers, including on the Mexico City Metro, line 1, with stations named for Moctezuma II and Cuauhtemoc.\nCuisine.\nMexican cuisine continues to be based on staple elements of Mesoamerican cooking and, particularly, of Aztec cuisine: corn, chili, beans, squash, tomato, and avocado. Many of these staple products continue to be known by their Nahuatl names, carrying in this way ties to the Aztec people who introduced these foods to the Spaniards and the world. Through the spread of ancient Mesoamerican food elements, particularly plants, Nahuatl loan words (\"chocolate\", \"tomato\", \"chili\", \"avocado\", \"tamale\", \"taco\", \"pupusa\", \"chipotle\", \"pozole\", \"atole\") have been borrowed through Spanish into other languages around the world. Through the spread and popularity of Mexican cuisine, the culinary legacy of the Aztecs can be said to have a global reach. Today, Aztec images and Nahuatl words are often used to lend an air of authenticity or exoticism in the marketing of Mexican cuisine.\nEthnic identity.\nAztec and Maya were newly listed examples given for American Indian groups in the 2020 United States census, and \"Aztec\" became the largest American Indian group that respondents identified as having a full background.\nIn popular culture.\nThe idea of the Aztecs has captivated the imaginations of Europeans since the first encounters and has provided many iconic symbols to Western popular culture. In his book \"The Aztec Image in Western Thought\", Benjamin Keen argued that Western thinkers have usually viewed Aztec culture through a filter of their cultural interests.\nThe Aztecs and figures from Aztec mythology feature in Western culture. The name of Quetzalcoatl, a feathered serpent god, has been used for a genus of pterosaurs, \"Quetzalcoatlus\", a large flying reptile with a wingspan of as much as . Quetzalcoatl has appeared as a character in many books, films and video games. American author Gary Jennings wrote two acclaimed historical novels set in Aztec-period Mexico, \"Aztec\" (1980) and \"Aztec Autumn\" (1997). The novels were so popular that four more novels in the Aztec series were written after his death.\nAztec society has also been depicted in cinema. The Mexican feature film \"The Other Conquest\" (Spanish: \"La Otra Conquista\") from 2000 was directed by Salvador Carrasco and illustrated the colonial aftermath of the 1520s Spanish Conquest of Mexico. The 1989 film \"Retorno a Aztl\u00e1n\" by Juan Mora Catlett is a work of historical fiction set during the rule of Motecuzoma I, filmed in Nahuatl and with the alternative Nahuatl title \"Necuepaliztli in Aztlan\". In Mexican exploitation B movies of the 1970s, a recurring figure was the \"Aztec mummy\" as well as Aztec ghosts and sorcerers.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources in English.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With his wife Leigh, he authored several best-selling epic fantasy novel series, including \"The Belgariad\" (1982\u201384), \"The Malloreon\" (1987\u201391), \"The Elenium\" (1989\u201391), \"The Tamuli\" (1992\u201394), and \"The Dreamers\" (2003\u201306).\nEarly life and career.\nEddings was born in Spokane, Washington, to George Wayne Eddings and Theone (Berge) Eddings, in 1931. Eddings was known to claim to be part Cherokee.\nEddings grew up near Puget Sound in the City of Snohomish. After graduating from Snohomish High School in 1949, he worked for a year before majoring in speech, drama and English at junior college. Eddings displayed an early talent for drama and literature, winning a national oratorical contest, and performing the male lead in most of his drama productions. He graduated with a BA from Reed College in 1954, writing his first novel, \"How Lonely Are The Dead\", as his senior thesis. After graduating from Reed College, Eddings was drafted into the U.S. Army, having also previously served in the National Guard. After being discharged in 1956, Eddings attended the graduate school of the University of Washington in Seattle for four years, graduating with an MA in 1961 after submitting a novel in progress, \"Man Running\", for his thesis.\nAfter earning his Master's, Eddings worked as a purchaser for Boeing, where he met his future wife, then known as Judith Leigh Schall. They married in 1962, with Judith taking the name Leigh Eddings. Through most of the 1960s, Eddings worked as an assistant professor at Black Hills State College in South Dakota.\nChild abuse conviction.\nEddings and his wife Leigh pled guilty to 11 counts of physical child abuse of their adopted children. They adopted one boy in 1966, Scott David, then two months old; subsequently, the couple adopted a girl between 1966 and 1969. In 1970, the couple lost custody of both children and were each sentenced to a year in jail in separate trials for extensive child abuse of both children. Though the trial and conviction of both David and Leigh Eddings was reported in the local press, the news was not widely disseminated, as Eddings was an obscure academic at the time. The conviction was consequently not remarked on after Eddings became a well-known author over a decade later; it was not widely publicly revealed until after his death.\nLiterary career.\nEarly literary career.\nEddings had completed the first draft of his first published novel, \"High Hunt\", in March 1971 while serving his jail term. \"High Hunt\" was a contemporary story of four young men hunting deer. Like many of his later novels, it explores themes of manhood and coming of age. Convinced that being an author was his future career, after a short period in Denver, David and Leigh Eddings moved to Spokane, where he relied on a job at a grocery shop for his funds. \"High Hunt\" was published in early 1972 by G. P. Putnam's Sons to modestly positive reviews.\nEddings continued to work on several unpublished novels, including \"Hunseeker's Ascent\", a story about mountain climbing, which was later burned, as Eddings claimed it was \"a piece of tripe so bad it even bored me.\" Most of his attempts followed the same vein as \"High Hunt\": adventure stories and contemporary tragedies. None were sold or published, with the eventual exception of \"The Losers\", which tells the story of God and the Devil cast in the roles of Raphael Taylor, gifted student and athlete, and Damon Flood, a scoundrel determined to bring Raphael down. Though written in the 1970s, \"The Losers\" was not published until June 1992, well after Eddings' success as an author was established.\nSuccess in fantasy writing.\nEddings doodled a fantasy map one morning before work. According to Eddings' account several years later, when seeing a copy of Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" in a bookshop, he muttered, \"Is this old turkey still floating around?\". He was surprised to learn that it was then in its 78th printing. He had, though, already included Tolkien's work in the syllabuses for at least three sections of his English Literature survey courses in the summer of 1967 and the springs of 1968 and 1969. He began to annotate the map doodle, which became the basis for his factional country of Aloria. Over the course of a year, Edding detailed around 250 pages of kingdoms, races, characters, theologies and a mythology.\nAs the \"Lord of the Rings\" had been published as three books, Eddings believed fantasy in general was supposed to be published in trilogy form. He initially laid out \"The Belgariad\" as three books, until his editor, Lester del Rey, advised him that booksellers would refuse to accept books of 600 pages. Del Rey suggested the series be published as five books. Eddings at first refused, but having already signed the contract, and with Del Rey's promise that he would receive advances for five books rather than three, agreed to the arrangement. \"Pawn of Prophecy\", the first volume in the series, was issued in April 1982. The next four novels where published between then and 1984. The series was popular. Eddings continued to produce fantasy novels for the rest of his life, usually producing a book every year or two.\nFrom 1995 onwards, the novels were credited jointly to Leigh Eddings; Eddings explained in a foreword that their working together as authors \"had been the case from the beginning.\" This is generally accepted as broadly accurate, although Eddings scholar James Gifford notes that collaboration would have been \"impossible\" with \"High Hunt\", as David Eddings' own notes show that the first draft was completed while he and Leigh were both in separate jails, about half-way through their terms.\nThe Eddingses' final work, the novel series \"The Dreamers\", was published in four volumes between 2003 and 2006.\nLater life.\nOn January 26, 2007, Eddings accidentally burned about a quarter of his office, next door to his house, along with his Excalibur sports car.\nOn February 28, 2007, David Eddings' wife Leigh died following a series of strokes that left her unable to communicate. She was 69. Eddings cared for her at home with her mother after her first stroke, which occurred three years before he finished writing \"The Dreamers\".\nEddings died of natural causes on June 2, 2009, in Carson City, Nevada.\nDennis, Eddings' brother, said that he had suffered from dementia for a long time, but that the disease had progressed rapidly since September 2008, and that he needed 24-hour care. He also confirmed that in his last months, his brother had been working on a manuscript that was unlike any of his other works, stating \"It was very, very different. I wouldn't call it exactly a satire of fantasy but it sure plays with the genre\". The unfinished work, along with his other manuscripts, went to his alma mater, Reed College, along with a bequest of $18 million to fund \"students and faculty studying languages and literature.\" Eddings also bequeathed $10 million to the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver for pediatric asthma treatment and research; Eddings' wife Leigh had asthma throughout her life.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was a bestseller from the first book in the series. It has been called both the \"last gasp\" of traditional fantasy and \"one of the founding megasagas\" of modern fantasy.\nBackground.\nDavid Eddings, who had been writing in the adventure and thriller genres, has said he developed the idea for a fantasy series somewhat \"cynically\" after noticing how many times J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" series had been reprinted. He had an epiphany, realizing the fantasy genre might be very lucrative and was currently \"underserved\". He mapped out an imaginary world to use in developing the story for the Belgariad.\nHe has also said he was influenced by reading medieval epics and by Lester del Rey's editorial input. In later works he acknowledged his wife, Leigh Eddings, as an \"unindicted collaborator\"; eventually later books credited her as co-author. She is generally acknowledged as a co-author of the earlier books as well.\nWorks in the series.\nThe Belgariad is composed of five books, namely ' (1982), ' (1982), ' (1983), ' (1984), and \"\" (1984).\nThe title of each book combines a chess term with a fantasy term; whereas the concept of a 'Game of Destiny' is a significant motif in the story. The series has been reprinted as a two-volume set, titled \"The Belgariad Volume One\", containing the first three books of the series, and \"The Belgariad Volume Two\", which contains the last two books. This does not include the original map by Chris Barbieri, but only Shelly Shapiro's map.\n\"The Malloreon\" is a five-book sequel to \"The Belgariad\". \"Belgarath the Sorcerer\" (1995) and \"Polgara the Sorceress\" (1997) are prequels that share the setting and most characters. \"The Rivan Codex\" (1998) features annotated background material.\n\"Pawn of Prophecy\".\nThe book opens with a prologue, beginning with the creation of the world by seven gods. Aldur, oldest of the seven, fashions a stone orb and creates within it a \"living soul\". Torak, the most beautiful of the seven, attempts to seize the Orb from Aldur and subdue the Orb's intelligence; the Orb mutilates the left side of Torak's body. The Orb of Aldur is later recovered by Belgarath the Sorcerer, King Cherek, and Cherek's sons. Riva, Cherek's youngest son, is found to be able to hold the Orb unharmed; he and his descendants protect the Orb from Torak.\nThe story then begins in earnest with the experiences of protagonist Garion. His childhood on a large, prosperous farm: his earliest memories in the kitchen of his Aunt Pol; his friend Durnik the blacksmith; early games and friends; and the romance between Garion and local girl Zubrette. It also introduces Belgarath, as a wandering storyteller nicknamed 'Mister Wolf'; Garion's telepathic vision of the antagonist Asharak/Chamdar; and a \"dry voice\" in his mind, distinct from his own consciousness. The reader later discovers that this is the Voice of Prophecy, or \"Necessity\", which takes action through him.\nWhen Belgarath, alias \"Wolf\", announces the theft of a mysterious object (actually the Orb), he, Garion, and Aunt Pol leave Faldor's farm to pursue the thief, reluctantly allowing Durnik to accompany them. They are joined later by Silk/Kheldar, a Drasnian prince, spy, and thief; and by Barak, a Cherek earl. Thereafter Mister Wolf follows an invisible trail through several regions until they are arrested.\nThey are taken to a meeting of monarchs where Garion suspects a green-cloaked individual of treason. A few days later, Barak and Garion are hunting wild boar when Garion notices the green-cloaked spy discussing further espionage; but before Garion can tell anyone of this, he is attacked by a wild boar, which is then slain by Barak in the form of a bear. Garion later exposes the green-cloaked spy, and the latter's patrons are defeated in a fight. Garion himself is almost captured, but escapes. \nGarion learns that Polgara is Belgarath's daughter and the sister of Garion's second-most-distant female ancestor (identified in the prologue as Queen Beldaran, wife of Riva), and for that reason called his aunt. Having learned this, Garion identifies Belgarath as his grandfather. The group, with the addition of an Algarian prince named Hettar, then leave in search of the Orb.\n\"Queen of Sorcery\".\nThe story opens in the Kingdom of Arendia, where Garion duels and then befriends a master archer named Lelldorin. The party travel to Lelldorin's uncle's manor, where Garion hears about a plot to kill the Mimbrate king Korodullin and to start a civil war between the two grand duchies. The plot is masterminded by a spy from Cthol Murgos named Nachak.\nAfter leaving Lelldorin's uncle's manor the party journey south towards the great plains where they are ambushed by a group of Algroths; a fictional \"monster\" devised by Eddings that are something between a goat facially and a gorilla bodily, while being somewhat akin to, even if a bit smaller than a troll (QoS Chapter 6). Lelldorin is gravely injured during the encounter which only ends with the arrival of Mandorallen, the supreme Mimbrate knight of the realm who chases them off. Just as he does so Chamdar's shade appears before them to mock them. Belgarath asks whether it was he who drove the Algroths out of the mountains of Ulgoland. Chamdar denies doing so but is less than convincing.\nAs they continue south, Mandorallen, upon Polgara's advice (but unknown to Garion who later judges Mandorallen's motives), forces Lelldorin on his honour to stay behind so he can heal from the wounds inflicted by the Algroth who had mauled him.\nThe party continue without Lelldorin to Vo Mimbre, the Arendish capital, where Garion reveals the plot to kill Korodullin, without naming its local conspirators, and Mandorallen challenges Nachak to a duel, which Hettar terminates by killing Nachak. Soon afterwards the party bid farewell to Vo Mimbre, with King Korodullin vowing to stamp out any untoward activity of the Angaraks (and particularly the Murgos) in his kingdom. He also pledged to ready his kingdom for the anticipated war against Torak's forces.\nThe party next travels to Tolnedra, and soon after crossing the border they come across a group of Monks from Mar Terrin. One of them, driven insane by the continual presence of the spirits of Maragor launches himself at Garion who naturally reaches out a hand. The man falls to the ground with an ugly welt on his head. Polgara instructs Garion to get off his horse and apologise to the man who comes to with his sanity restored. The monks proclaim a miracle, but Garion knows otherwise as do Belgarath and Polgara.\nIn healing the monk of his madness, Garion performed his first, albeit unknowingly, act of sorcery.\nThey then press on with their quest with their next planned stop being to talk to the Emperor Ran Borune in the city of Tol Honeth, and are nearly captured by a group of mercenaries for the Queen of neighboring Nyissa. At Tol Honeth, Belgarath and Polgara urge the Emperor to rid Tolnedra of the invading 'Murgos'; but Ran Borune refuses. Ce'Nedra bursts in towards the end of the meeting and Garion feels a sense of \"recognition\" although he has no idea how their lives would become forever entwined in the near future. Almost immediately afterwards Asharak presents himself to Ran Borune and it is revealed that Chamdar and Asharak are in fact the same person.\nUpon leaving the capital, the group acquire an ineffectually-disguised Princess Ce'Nedra (Ran Borune's daughter), and enter the Wood of the Dryads, hoping to cross into Nyissa ahead of their opponent Zedar. In the Wood, Ce'Nedra asks the Dryad Queen Xantha for sanctuary, on grounds of common ancestry; but is refused and soon after the continue on the journey. \nAs they set off and leave the Dryads behind Silk and Belgarath head off on their own in pursuit of Zedar and the Orb as they'd be able to move faster, with the intention being to meet up again in the Nyissan capital of Sthiss Tor in a couple of weeks. \nMeanwhile, the rest of them start making their own way directly to Sthiss Tor, but are detained by Tolnedran legionnaires under the command of Grand Duke Kador of Tol Vordue. They are accompanied by Asharak / Chamdar. Kador demands that Ce'Nedra be handed over to secure Kador's claim on the imperial throne. Asharak just wants Polgara and Garion and doesn't care what happens to the others. Polgara is powerless to do anything because Asharak has his hand grasped on Garion's heart (in the sense that he could crush it using sorcery). Almost unnoticed Garion alone can act and when Asharak slaps Polgara, Garion strikes Asharak and speaks the word \"burn\" and Asharak bursts into flames. For just a moment Garion's compassion almost saves Asharak but then Polgara tells Garion in his mind that it was Asharak who killed his parents. Suddenly, the flames are not hot enough and Garion keeps the flames on him until he dies. \nPolgara exalts and calls Garion, Belgarion (his birthright name) for the first time.\nUpon this shocking act of sorcery Kador's men turn against him and remember their loyalty to the Emperor. They take Kador prisoner and promise to deliver him to the garrison at Tol Borune as commanded to by Ce-Nedra who is speaking in her authority as an Imperial Princess of Tolnedra.\nArriving at Nyissa by boat, Garion, angry at the treatment of the slaves there, uses the Will and the Word (the ability shared by himself with Belgarath, Polgara, and all other sorcerers in the story) to teleport one but does not know that the leeches in the river are poisonous so the slave dies. Following a quarrel with Polgara, during which she explains to him that the power he had used to kill Asharak was the same as the one he had earlier used unwittingly to cure a madman, Garion is kidnapped, drugged, and presented to Queen Salmissra to be used as a mind-controlled sex slave. He is rescued by Polgara and Barak (the latter again assuming a bear's shape); and Polgara, with permission by Issa, the god of the Nyissans, transforms Salmissra into an immortal snake. Thereafter Garion is reconciled with Polgara.\n\"Magician's Gambit\".\nAfter learning at the end of the Queen of Sorcery that the Angarak sorcerer Ctuchik had stolen the Orb from its erstwhile thief Zedar, Belgarion and friends set off for the Vale of Aldur after Belgarath had received instruction to do so from Aldur Himself.\nAlthough they preferred to avoid it, the party were eventually left with no other choice than to pass through Maragor, which was haunted by the spirit of Mara himself, who manifests his grief (for the Marags were slain by the Tolnedrans many centuries earlier) through countless ghostly apparitions that drive anybody who dares to enter Maragor (usually for the rich gold deposits) mad. On the whole only the monks - \"Tolnedra's conscience\" - are tolerated. \nIn order to pass through Maragor mentally unscathed, Belgarath and Polgara put everybody into a trance and somehow, while the others go under, Garion slipped into a semi-wakeful consciousness that has to all intents and purposes turned off his emotions. The \"voice\" (of the prophecy) had been waiting for this opportunity to talk to him rationally about what he is destined to do and it is here that an analogy comes up.\nIn the analogy the voice describes how something went wrong in the universe and it created two divergent destinies one of which is the original and the other an alternative. Garion equates this to when Doroon broke a window at Faldor's Farm and the voice goes along with this and suggests that if another stone was to be thrown quickly enough then it could deflect the first stone and Faldor's window would be saved. The implication being that the voice is the stone-thrower and Garion is the stone.\nSoon after the conversation finishes, the party come before Mara and Belgarath and Polgara appeal to him to set aside his grief as the time of prophecy is at hand. Still inconsolable, Mara refuses and his grief turns to anger when he sets his eyes on Ce-Nedra, a child of Nedra. In his anger he threatens her with all kind of unpleasantness and suffering but when he goes to strike against her the voice intervenes through Garion. Too powerful to strike Mara, for fear of destroying the world, the voice stands unmoved and resolute until Mara yields and the voice urges everybody to leave Mara to his grief, as Ce-Nedra's presence pains him terribly. \nThey duly do so, although Belgarath and the voice talk briefly and both Polgara and Belgarath come to understand that Garion is now ready to be trained in the \"Will and the Word\". When the voice goes Garion is put into a deeper slumber like most of the rest of his companions before they are all woken up having passed through Maragor.\nNow they are somewhere probably in the foothills of Ulgoland and Hettar notes that one of the pack mares, pregnant, is in serious trouble. With the condition of the mare getting worse and the weather turning against them, Garion suggests they shelter in the cave, which he had previously been unaware of but somehow knew was always there. He led everybody straight to it and they soon took shelter.\nThe cave, according to Belgarath, was the meeting place of the Gods and where they conferred during the making of the world. \nSoon afterwards the mare gives birth but the foal is stillborn. Without hesitation, Garion moves and brings it back to life. This is of significance because Polgara and Belgarath maintained that before this, it was impossible to use the \"Will and the Word\" to restore life to the dead. \nSoon afterwards they leave the cave and continue their journey to The Vale.\nUpon arriving in the Vale, Aldur confers with Belgarath and Polgara, but before they go aside Garion accompanies Belgarath to his tower and begins his instruction in earnest. Although the significance of what follows is not acknowledged by Eddings until the next chapter, Garion transitions from thinking in terms of \"Mister Wolf\" and now thinks in terms of \"Belgarath\". It is a milestone in the series as Garion leaves behind his childhood understanding and fully accepts that Mister Wolf is in fact Eternal Belgarath. \nSoon afterwards Garion attempts a conscious act of sorcery for the first time rather than an instinctive and spontaneous use of it, as he had done when healing the mad monk, burning Chamdar, translocating the slave in Nyissa and reviving Horse (as the colt came to be known). He moves the self-same rock that Belgarath moved many millennia earlier with semi-disastrous results which prompts a lot of amusement, but more importantly more instruction.\nSoon after they leave for Rak Cthol and on their way the group enters Ulgoland, and head for the hidden city of Prolgu which is down in the caves below the ancient city. Proglu was abandoned after the cracking of the world sent the monsters insane. Before they get there they encounter a herd of carnivorous hruglin, horse-like creatures, and have to kill the stallion to drive them off. Just before Hettar kills the stallion his mind (as a Sha-Dar) connects with it just momentarily before the madness returns and he regrettably kills it. \nAs they continue they also come face to face with Grul, an Eldrak, a giant creature related to trolls, but far more intelligent and far more deadly. They are forced to fight him to the death and it comes at some cost with both Mandorallen and Durnik suffering significant injuries. Barak also receives a leg wound.\nAfter that, they continue unmolested to Prolgu and are welcomed by the Gorim - chieftain and elder of the Ulgo. They are there to recruit Relg a rock diviner who has both the special ability to detect caves but also to pass through the very rock itself. According to prophecies both Angarak and Western there is enough of a suggestion that caves exist below Rak Cthol which will provide a way in when they go to retrieve the Orb. Relg, as it turns out is a zealot and a fanatic and according to Gorim the \"worst of the lot\". When he is presented before Gorim and the party he initially refuses until UL, the father of the Gods makes himself present and commands Relg to go. UL then turns his attention to Ce'Nedra and compels her to stay behind as a guest of Gorim, the Ulgos. UL warns that if she goes to Cthol Murgos she will surely die and the prophecy will be lost. Ce'Nedra usually willful and independently minded, recognises the authority of the command and stays behind as ordered.\nSo with Relg now on board the party travel to Cthol Murgos. On their way to Rak Cthol they meet Yarblek, a Nadrak merchant (who later becomes a significant secondary character) and are nearly caught by Taur Urgas, the King of the Murgos. The party made their escape out of the back of a tent just in time. Silk who'd tried to flee beforehand, on hearing that Taur Urgas was approaching with an army, was caught by Brill when attempting to flee. The party were in great despair about Silk's fate but then Relg, used his specially rock divining gift to go and simply pick him up and. although the experience of seeping through the rock left Silk traumatised he was physically fine and so they continued with the journey. Later Garion learns how to create a mind shield which, with Polgara, is used to hide the party on their approach while Belgarath concentrates on Ctuchik himself. They enter Rak Cthol through the caves that lead to the slave pens and on the way they meet Taiba (a Marag slave woman;'The Mother of the Race who Died') and do what they can to make her comfortable before carrying on. On their way up they encounter Brill again, who Silk dispatches with a throw that tosses him over the parapets to his death. Silk later jokes that Brill was trying to fly, but not doing very well unless \"bouncing counts\". Ultimately they reach Ctuchik's chambers, which only Belgarath, Garion and Polgara enter with the others being told to wait outside. Ctuchik gloats that he has won as he intends to kill Ce'Nedra and destroy The Prophecy, but then to his chagrin he realises she is not among the party and is invulnerable under the protection of UL himself. Belgarath takes great satisfaction at his adversary's miscalculation, which had actually made their passing through of Cthol Murgos easier. Belgarath then fights Ctuchik. Driven by a vision of Garion suddenly taking hold of the Orb, Ctuchik attempts to \"unmake\" the Orb and thus \"unmakes\" himself. The explosion sets off an earthquake. The group escapes, taking the now unconscious Belgarath and Errand the Orb Bearer. With the book ending with them fleeing the collapsing city.\n\"Castle of Wizardry\".\nOn their way out of the caves under Rak Cthol they pause briefly to pick up Taiba who Relg pulls through the collapsed rocks, just as he has done Silk after he had been captured by Brill. Now out in the open the role of leader is thrust upon Garion with Belgarath incapacitated after his fight with Ctuchik and Polgara focusing on protecting Errand. Unable to attack Errand directly the Hierarchs of Rak Cthol go for Durnik instead. With the guidance of The Prophecy Garion climbs into his shadow and goes after them. He soon finds them in the broken remains of Rak Cthol and shatters the jewel which they are using to concentrate their will before rather melodramatically threatening one of the Hierarchs by clutching his shadow hand around his heart. When Garion's shadow returns Belgarath stirs briefly and now the threat has been neutralised they are able to continue unshielded, but with the knowledge that Taur Urgas is pursuing them.\nAs they race across Cthol Murgos in the direction of Algaria things gets very tight and they are not helped by their horses cramping up. In the end, just when they thought they were about to be intercepted countless Algarian horsemen swept down and slaughtered a great many of the Murgos. For just a brief moment Taur Urgas and King Cho-Hag of Algaria came within range of each other before once more being swept apart by the ensuing battle.\nThat very evening Belgarath collapses and is carried to The Stronghold with the utmost urgency for his very life was in danger. Cajoled, tormented and molly-coddled, Polgara nurses him back to health. In doing so she abandons her usual remedies as she knows her father well enough to realise that he will just lay back and indulge in being taken care of. What he needed most was mental stimulation and what she feared most was that he might have lost his ability to use the \"Will and the Word\" the very thing that had kept Angarak in check since The Battle of Vo Mimbre some 500 years earlier.\nOnce recovered and in time for Erastide they travelled to Riva, but not before picking up Ce'Nedra from Ulgo. Then as they head west, Garion, Polgara, Ce'Nedra and Durnik visit Faldor's Farm for one last time. For Polgara it was so she could pick up some favourite pots she'd been left behind, but most importantly it was for Garion to find closure on that chapter of his life which is best represented by how coldly he showed affection, but no love, for Zubrette, his childhood sweetheart.\nNow in Riva, Belgarion is led by Belgarath, Polgara, and the Voice of Prophecy to accept the Orb of Aldur from Errand in the Hall of the Rivan King, where the ancient Sword rests above the Rivan Throne. In Garion's hands, the Orb identifies him as the long-lost heir to the throne. This revelation infuriates Ce'Nedra, who discovers herself betrothed to him. During the investiture, Garion, aided by the Voice of Prophecy, sees each member of the quest as an Instrument of Prophecy.\nShortly after the betrothal, Garion learns from the Mrin Prophecy that the Rivan King must slay the god Torak or die in the process. In order to save lives and try to avoid a catastrophic war, like the one that had culminated in the Battle of Vo Mimbre some 500 years previously, Belgarion decided to set off relatively on his own to face Torak.Taking only Belgarath, and Silk with him he left notes for Polgara and Ce'Nedra with instructions not to pursue them.\nFrom this point in the story the narrative is split into two tracks, with the first following Garion, Belgarath and Silk and the second following Ce'Nedra and everything that happens around her. The two tracks are brought back together in \"Enchanter's End Game\" when all the protagonists are brought together again just before the confrontation with Torak.\n(Additionally, from time to time, in \"Enchanter's End Game\", a third minor track is added with a chapter devoted to events far away from the main events centred on the rulers of the western kingdoms - including Nyissa).\nThe three of them pass through Drasnia, where they happen upon Vordai, the Witch of the Fens who is hospitable but quite defensive. Later to their chargin, they realise they are trapped in the fens and Vordai exacts a price for showing them the way out. She insists that Belgarath gives the fenlings (small otter-like creatures) the power of speech as she knew she wouldn't be around much longer to protect them. Garion is immediately alarmed, for fear that Belgarath has lost his power but by the time he tells Vordai it is too late. After conferring with the spirit of Aldur, Belgarath gives the fenlings the power to talk and it was only later when Garion realises that even he could have used sorcery to find their way out of the fens that Belgarath had done it out of compassion. Any thoughts of Belgarath losing his power are forever dispelled at that moment.\nThey then head towards Boktor where they confer with Porenn and Silk meets his mother who was once one of the great beauties of Drasnia. She was tragically blinded and marred by a vicious plague some 20 years earlier and visiting her was very hard on Silk who sees the blinding as half a blessing as his mother can no longer look on her face and see how scarred it became after the plague had left her disfigured. \nMeanwhile, upon discovery of Garion, Belgarath and Silk's departure, Polgara enters a rage, which devastates her apartment and causes a thunderstorm overhead. Ce'Nedra too, feeling humiliated and taking it personally, has her own tantrum before calming down. She then discovers the power of Beldaran's necklace and, having learnt the reason for Garion's departure, she raises an international army to distract the Angaraks from Garion's quest so that he may reach Cthol Mishrak safely and overcome Torak.\n\"Enchanters' End Game\".\nThe final book of the series starts with Belgarion, Silk, and Belgarath sneaking through Gar og Nadrak on their way to Mallorea. In the opening chapters they are accompanied first by a Drasnian trader and then later by an old man who lives a hermit like existence in the forests. He warns them that Mallorean recruiters are forcibly enlisting people into the army for the forthcoming war. Soon they come across a mining town and have a conversation with a local Nadrak who tells of a \"Queen\" raising an army in the west. Garion is incredulous and even wonders if it was Polgara. Soon afterwards Mallorean recruiters arrive and the three of them manage to get out just in time - unlike their new Nadrak friend.\nAs they continue on their quest the three of them enter the Nadrak forest and Garion comes to see that he understands the language of wolves even in his human form. Soon they stop off in a small town. It is only worthy of a mention because it is here that they come across Vella for the first time, a Nadrak woman, who later becomes an important secondary character as she gets to know Yarblek and then later on, in the Mallorean, Beldin. Due to Silk being recognised as a wanted man they soon have to flee with a pack of wolves, one of which Garion had not long met and conversed with, putting the trackers off.\nAs they carry on eastwards they are ambushed in a tavern and Garion and Silk are forcibly enlisted into the Mallorean army. Belgarath somehow manages to escape. En route to Thull Zelik, the Mallorean army's staging post, the recruiters and their hapless prisoners are met my Yarblek the Nadrak who quickly disposes of the Malloreans before telling Garion and Silk that he is under orders from Drosta lek Thun, the King of the Nadraks to deliver Silk to him.\nWith Belgarath still nowhere in sight, Garion and Silk travel with Yarblek to Yar Nadrak, the capital, where they meet Drosta in some run down squalid inn. Just before they meet Drosta they see Belgarath apparently drunk in a corner of the inn with his head down.\nDrosta is looking for a way out of the war and freedom from Mallorean domination and he asks for help, or to at least get a message to Rhodar before Belgarath bursts in and rapidly moves things along. Then, realising who Garion is, Drosta lets them continue on their journey.\nThey are tracked by Malloreans who follow them out of Yar Nadrak, but they manage to stay well ahead of them. However, under such pressure they decide to turn north and go across Morindland to the land bridge between the two continents rather than continue as they originally intended. Just as they decided Beldin pays them a visit and updates them on what is happening in the West and the current strategy that aims to get the Cherek fleet into the Sea of the East to stop the Malloreans from flooding in. Belgarath is deeply unhappy as he realises that such a strategy could backfire and 'Zakath will use the very land bridge he intends to use to get to Cthol Mishrak and thus block their passage. Beldin also delivers the news that the Orb will restore Torak's marred face. \nThey get across Morindland, after fighting off a challenge from an other clan.\nThen as they finally get across to Mallorea, Garion is tempted by Torak to accept him as a father and Polgara as his mother, but rejects this offer and reaches Cthol Mishrak unchallenged.\nCe'Nedra's army invades Angarak lands, and wins a hard-fought Battle at Thull Mardu with both physical and magical powers employed by both sides. However, in the moment of victory Ce'Nedra, Polgara, Durnik, and Errand are captured by the emperor Zakath of Mallorea, who gives them to Zedar to offer to Torak. \"En route\" to Cthol Mishrak, Polgara reveals that the Mallorean Prophecies identify her as Torak's fianc\u00e9e, and that her resistance to Torak's call may decide Belgarion's duel. Zedar takes his prisoners to Torak's chamber, where Zedar kills Durnik, enraging Belgarath, who buries him alive. Torak attempts to sway Polgara; but Garion sends images of Durnik into her mind, thereby helping her to withstand Torak's call. A final battle ensues, during which Garion and Torak swell into immensity, and in which Garion, having 'rejected' Torak again, kills him outright. The other gods claim Torak's body, and UL, revealed as the father of the gods, agrees to allow Garion to revive Durnik; Mara objects, but relents when Belgarath reveals the existence of Taiba.\nUpon the company's return to Riva, Garion and Ce'Nedra plan their wedding, while Polgara and Durnik are married in a private chapel in the Citadel. Here, Durnik reveals that he received the \"Will and the Word\" when he was brought back to life, and that Belgarath had been training him to control the \"will and the word\". Ce'Nedra and Garion are married, dance with everyone, and retire to their chambers. The story ends with a half-drunk Belgarath having a conversation with the Orb, while Garion and Ce'Nedra consummate their marriage.\nReception and impact.\nThe series was a bestseller and an instant sensation. \"Publishers Weekly\" in their review of \"The Rivan Codex\" (1998) called \"The Belgariad\" \"one of the founding megasagas in modern English-language fantasy.\" The Guardian credited Eddings with creating \"the craze for doorstopper-sized fantasy series\". The series was published in a transitional period for fantasy literature, when the genre was becoming more \"complex and nuanced,\" and the Eddings books were a sort of \"last gasp\" of popularity for traditional fantasy. Stephen Hunt said the books \"were fantasy, but they carried a modern feel to the dialogue and characterisation, while still being firmly placed in a deeply believable fantasy world.\" \nJason Heller wrote a retrospective on the series for NPR in 2017 after re-reading the books as an adult ~30 years after reading them originally. He found the archetypical fantasy aspects had aged reasonably well despite his expectations that the tropes might feel worn out, and noted the story's very direct use of the hero's journey from Joseph Campbell. Heller did find that the gender roles had aged poorly, though: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Aunt Pol \u2014 who also happens to be Polgara the Sorceress, the most feared and powerful woman in the world \u2014 spends an inordinate amount of page-time happily doing domestic chores. Princess Ce'Nedra, Garion's love interest, intrepidly raises an entire army only to leave it in the hands of the men. Certain characters break stereotype, such as Queen Porenn, who has an excellent grasp of policy and tactics \u2014 but it's always made wincingly clear in the text that she's a glaring exception who only knows about military and political matters because she's married to a king who's taught her such things.\u2014\u200a\nHeller also felt that the series uncritically mirrored the real-life East\u2013West dichotomy, and that this aspect also bothered him as an adult. The protagonists are largely fair-skinned good guys in the West, while the antagonists of the series are from the kingdoms of the East and \"systematically sinister or congenitally stupid.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sequel to the Belgariad.\nThe Malloreon is a five-part fantasy book series written by David Eddings, which follows \"The Belgariad\". The Malloreon is set in the same world as The Belgariad, but expands on several aspects of the setting, especially the eastern continent of Mallorea.\nWorks in the series.\nWhile the story concludes in The Malloreon, minor events occur in the prequels \"Belgarath the Sorcerer\" and \"Polgara the Sorceress\", which otherwise cover the history of the world.\n\"Guardians of the West\".\nAt the end of \"The Belgariad\", Garion has slain the evil god Torak and expects lasting peace. The first half of the book concentrates on the first eight years of Belgarion's reign, describing minor problems including Queen Ce'Nedra's seeming infertility and a civil war in Arendia. All of these problems are resolved without much trouble, their resolutions providing some comic relief. The book also depicts the life of Errand, Polgara's ward. During his years under her care, Errand displays near-omniscience; this puzzles Polgara and Belgarath. During the same years, Errand encounters a lesson learned telepathically from an ancient tree and two contacts with people important to his destiny. The inciting action of the story occurs when Garion and Errand are both summoned by the Orb of Aldur, and the Voice of Prophecy warns them \"Beware Zandramas!\". Thereafter Garion and Belgarath seek to discover the identity and purpose of Zandramas through records of ancient, dubious prophecies. Ultimately, Garion learns that he is still a figure of prophecy and bears the responsibility of defeating Torak's successor, the \"Child of Dark\".\nSubsequent to Garion's discovery, his regent Brand is murdered by assassins sent to kill Ce'Nedra and her newborn son Geran. The assassins are traced to the Bear-Cult, a legion of ethnocentric fanatics dedicated to reunification of the empire divided among the sons of Garion's ancestor King Cherek. In response, Garion and other descendants of Cherek destroy the Bear-Cult, but are unable to prevent the abduction of Prince Geran. When the cult rising is put down, it is revealed that the leader of the cultists is the priest/sorcerer Harakan, a servant of Torak's disciple Urvon. Harakan escapes shortly after the revelation of his true identity.\nThe military leaders are later visited by the clairvoyant Cyradis, who reveals that Geran's kidnapping was carried out by Zandramas, the new Child of Dark, and that Garion must recover him with the help of Belgarath, Polgara, Ce'Nedra, Errand, Durnik, and Silk; but shall later acquire the Huntress (a Drasnian spy named Liselle or Velvet), the Man Who Is No Man (the eunuch Sadi), the Empty One (Mallorean Emperor Zakath), the Silent Man (Cyradis' bodyguard Toth) and the Woman Who Watches (Belgarath's wife Poledra). With these companions he must travel to the Place Which Is No More for the final meeting between Light and Dark that will decide the fate of the world. When all objections are overcome, the company assembles and departs.\n\"King of the Murgos\".\nIn this book, Belgarion and his fellow travelers learn more about the murderous woman Zandramas and of her minion, a white-eyed Angarak named Naradas. During their stay in Nyissa they recruit Sadi, a eunuch expelled from Queen Salmissra's court. Sadi convinces the group to pose as slavers searching for escaped runaways as the Mallorean army ravages Cthol Murgos. When they enter the wastelands of Cthol Murgos, they are captured by the desert-dwelling Dagashi and given the task of secreting an assassin through the Mallorean army lines. Eventually, they arrive in the palace of the King of the Murgos, Urgit, and discover, to Kheldar's surprise, that his father had sired the Murgo King while on a diplomatic mission many years before.\nUrgit, upon learning that Kheldar is his half-brother, arranges for the group to travel south to the Isle of Verkat. Before they leave the city, they find that the Dagashi assassin is in fact Harakan. Garion and Harakan duel with swords until Harakan realizes he is about to lose and resorts to sorcery to save himself. The group then sails south. En route, their ship wrecks and they must travel to the coast on foot. On the coast, Toth tells them that Cyradis has arranged a boat to take them to the island. On the island, they are directed to Ashaba, Torak's ruined castle. Before they can leave the island, Mallorean soldiers come looking for them, and Cyradis, who must abet both Necessities equally, tells Toth to alert the guards to their presence. The book ends with the company being sent to Emperor Zakath's Imperial Stronghold.\n\"Demon Lord of Karanda\".\nAt the beginning of this chapter, Belgarion and his fellow travellers are brought to Mallorea. There Belgarion meets Kal Zakath, the Mallorean emperor bent on destroying the Murgos' royal family. Gradually, Zakath and Garion become friends. When a sudden plague spreads, necessitating quarantine, the questing party escape the city so as to continue their journey. In escape, they are joined by the jester Feldegast (actually Belgarath's 'brother' Beldin in disguise), with whom they approach Ashaba. Problems arise when they confirm the report of demons under the Demon Lord Nahaz, who has turned the sorcerer Urvon insane.\nReaching Ashaba, Garion is tricked into believing that he sees Zandramas and his son meeting with Urvon and charges into the throne room. Beldin, on seeing Urvon and his man Harakan, assumes his true form; this starts a battle with Urvon's forces, which ultimately results in Harakan's death. Nahaz faces the group of sorcerers and the Orb, ready to fight; but when Eriond comes to stand with Garion, the Demon Lord flees, carrying Urvon with him. The group then continues east. Travelling through the demon-infested countryside, and seeing horrors such as women impregnated by demons (the births usually resulting in the mother's death), the group encounters Zandramas, who attempts to coerce Ce'Nedra within killing distance, until Poledra, Polgara's mother and Belgarath's wife, forces Zandramas to retreat.\n\"Sorceress of Darshiva\".\nThe party enters the Melcene Empire, where they discover that the Sardion, the moral opposite of the Orb of Aldur, was once kept in an undersea cave where traces of its power still resonate. Upon reaching the University at Melcena, Belgarath finds an unmutilated copy of the Ashabine Oracles, which he has sought, and decides that the party must go to Kell to learn of the location of \"The Place That Is No More\". Garion, in the same book, sees that in his sole moment of sanity, Torak specifically addressed Belgarion, demanding that if need be he should destroy the world, even kill his own son, rather than let Zandramas complete her plans. This reflects a similar warning made by Cyradis in \"Guardians of the West\". Having achieved this knowledge, the group return to Mallorea and travel overland. At some point thereafter, a suggestion is made that Torak's existence was an aberration and that another God shall appear to take his place.\nThe party is recaptured by Zakath, who threatens to take Garion back to Mal Zeth with his companions as collateral. At Beldin's request, Cyradis persuades him to release the party, offering herself as a hostage; Zakath does so and joins their quest. Shortly thereafter, Poledra joins them in the guise of a wolf, bringing an orphaned cub later domesticated by Ce'Nedra. Her identity is concealed from both characters and reader until the next book.\nUrvon's Karand army under Nahaz and Zandramas' Darshivan army eventually engage each other in battle, as do Urvon's Demon Lord Nahaz and Zandramas' Demon Lord Mordja. The demons go after Garion's group, sensing the Orb's presence, but Aldur infuses Durnik with his own powers, and he defeats and banishes Nahaz. Aldur, before leaving, informs Belgarath, Beldin, and Polgara that Durnik is \"also my beloved Disciple, as he was the best suited of ye\". An amulet shaped in the likeness of a sledgehammer (the only one made by Aldur without the aid of Belgarath) is then bestowed upon the smith.\n\"The Seeress of Kell\".\nThe group continues to Kell, where they meet with Cyradis. As promised, the Seeress surrenders herself to Zakath, and directs the others to Perivor, an island to the southwest of the Mallorean continent. Garion's party and Zandramas's servant Naradas attempt to find maps in Perivor, a kingdom of shipwrecked Mimbrates, that point the way to the Place Which Is No More. Naradas, disguised as a court minister, delays Garion with red-herring quests, whereafter Sadi poisons him. With the aid of a Necromancer, they expose his treachery to the King and find an ancient map on which Place Which is No More is the 'High Places of Korim', an ancient temple of Torak. There, they confront Zandramas. A battle ensues against her Grolim priests, as well as the demon Mordja. Mordja kills the blindfolded Seeress's guide Toth; but Garion slays the demon with his ancestral sword.\nThe group then accompanies Zandramas into the Sardion's resting place, where Zandramas chooses Geran as the next Child of Dark, whereupon Garion chooses Eriond as the next Child of Light. Cyradis, still grieving over the loss of Toth and unable to consult her people, is terrified of making the wrong choice, until Polgara removes her blindfold. Receiving a final challenge from Zandramas, Cyradis ultimately chooses Eriond, whereupon Zandramas and the Sardion are changed into stars and transported into outer space.\nThe Voice of Prophecy explains that the events of the preceding books were the result of an ancient 'accident' in space, that resulted in the Light and Dark prophecies, and that Eriond, the final Child of the Light, is now the God of Angarak. Zakath's personal guard soon arrives on the Imperial ship. In the harbor, Barak, Lelldorin, Mandorallen, and Hettar arrive in Barak's ship, with Barak's son Unrak tied to the ship's mast. Here, it is revealed that Unrak is his father's successor to the position of the Rivan King's guardian, the Dreadful Bear. The sorcerers honor the fallen Toth by populating his funeral slab with eternally growing flowers and sealing off the section of Mount Korim with glowing quartz as his tomb.\nAfter leaving Eriond, Zakath, and Cyradis, the adventurers return home in Barak's ship, where it is revealed that both Ce'Nedra and Polgara are pregnant. The story ends with Garion reading a letter from Zakath, showing that Zakath has now married Cyradis and is witness to the social changes wrought by Eriond, while Garion, Belgarath, and Durnik are in the Vale of Aldur, as Polgara gives birth to twins. This birth is theorized as the first \"new\" event in their world's history.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53207", "revid": "49291118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53207", "title": "Record producer", "text": "Individual supervising a musical project\nA record producer or music producer is a music-creating project's overall supervisor whose responsibilities can involve a range of creative and technical leadership roles. Typically the job involves hands-on oversight of recording sessions; ensuring artists deliver acceptable and quality performances, supervising the technical engineering of the recording, and coordinating the production team and process. The producer's involvement in a musical project can vary in depth and scope. Sometimes in popular genres the producer may create the recording's entire sound and structure. However, in classical music recording, for example, the producer serves as more of a liaison between the conductor and the engineering team. The role is often likened to that of a film director, though there are important differences. It is distinct from the role of an executive producer, who is mostly involved in the recording project on an administrative level, and from the audio engineer who operates the recording technology.\nVarying by project, the producer may or may not choose all of the artists. If employing only synthesized or sampled instrumentation, the producer may be the sole artist. Conversely, some artists do their own production. Some producers are their own engineers, operating the technology across the project: preproduction, recording, mixing, and mastering. Record producers' precursors were \"A&amp;R men\", who likewise could blend entrepreneurial, creative, and technical roles, but often exercised scant creative influence, as record production still focused, into the 1950s, on simply improving the record's sonic match to the artists' own live performance.\nAdvances in recording technology, especially the 1940s advent of tape recording\u2014which Les Paul promptly innovated further to develop multitrack recording\u2014and the 1950s rise of electronic instruments, turned record production into a specialty. In popular music, then, producers like George Martin, Phil Spector and Brian Eno led its evolution into its present use of elaborate techniques and unrealistic sounds, creating songs impossible to originate live. After the 1980s, production's move from analog to digital further expanded possibilities. By now, DAWs, or digital audio workstations, like Logic Pro, Pro Tools and Studio One, turn an ordinary computer into a production console, whereby a solitary novice can become a skilled producer in a thrifty home studio. In the 2010s, efforts began to increase the prevalence of producers and engineers who are women, heavily outnumbered by men and prominently accoladed only in classical music.\nProduction overview.\nAs a broad project, the creation of a popular music recording may be split across three specialists: the executive producer, who oversees business partnerships and financing; the vocal producer or vocal arranger, who aids vocal performance via expert critique and coaching of vocal technique, and the record producer or music producer, who, often called simply the producer, directs the overall creative process of recording the song in its final mix.\nThe producer's roles can include gathering ideas, composing music, choosing session musicians, proposing changes to song arrangements, coaching the performers, controlling sessions, supervising the audio mixing, and, in some cases, supervising the audio mastering. A producer may give creative control to the artists themselves, taking a supervisory or advisory role instead. As to qualifying for a Grammy nomination, the Recording Academy defines a producer:\nThe person who has overall creative and technical control of the entire recording project, and the individual recording sessions that are part of that project. He or she is present in the recording studio or at the location recording and works directly with the artist and engineer. The producer makes creative and aesthetic decisions that realize both the artist's and label's goals in the creation of musical content. Other duties include, but are not limited to: keeping budgets and schedules; adhering to deadlines; hiring musicians, singers, studios, and engineers; overseeing other staffing needs; and editing (Classical projects).\nThe producer often selects and collaborates with a mixing engineer, who focuses on the especially technological aspects of the recording process, namely, operating the electronic equipment and blending the raw, recorded tracks of the chosen performances, whether vocal or instrumental, into a \"mix\", either stereo or surround sound. Then a mastering engineer further adjusts this recording for distribution on the chosen media. A producer may work on only one or two songs or on an artist's entire album, helping develop the album's overall vision. The record producers may also take on the role of executive producer, managing the budget, schedules, contracts, and negotiations.\nHistorical developments.\nA&amp;R team.\nIn the 1880s, the record industry began by simply having the artist perform at a phonograph. In 1924, the trade journal \"Talking Machine World\", covering the phonography and record industry, reported that Eddie King, Victor Records' manager of the \"New York artist and repertoire department\", had planned a set of recordings in Los Angeles. Later, folklorist Archie Green called this perhaps the earliest printed use of \"A&amp;R man\". Actually, it says neither \"A&amp;R man\" nor even \"A&amp;R\", an initialism perhaps coined by \"Billboard\" magazine in 1946, and entering wide use in the late 1940s.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, A&amp;R executives, like Ben Selvin at Columbia Records, Nathaniel Shilkret at Victor Records, and Bob Haring at Brunswick Records became the precursors of record producers, supervising recording and often leading session orchestras. During the 1940s, major record labels increasingly opened official A&amp;R departments, whose roles included supervision of recording. Meanwhile, independent recording studios opened, helping originate \"record producer\" as a specialty. But despite a tradition of some A&amp;R men writing music, \"record production\" still referred to just the manufacturing of record discs.\nRecord producers.\nAfter World War II, pioneering A&amp;R managers who transitioned influentially to record production as now understood, while sometimes owning independent labels, include J. Mayo Williams and John Hammond. Upon moving from Columbia Records to Mercury Records, Hammond appointed Mitch Miller to lead Mercury's popular recordings in New York. Miller then produced country-pop crossover hits by Patti Page and by Frankie Laine, moved from Mercury to Columbia, and became a leading A&amp;R man of the 1950s.\nDuring the decade, A&amp;R executives increasingly directed songs' sonic signatures, although many still simply teamed singers with musicians, while yet others exercised virtually no creative influence. The term \"record producer\" in its current meaning\u2014the creative director of song production\u2014appearing in a 1953 issue of \"Billboard\" magazine, became widespread in the 1960s. Still, a formal distinction was elusive for some time more. A&amp;R managers might still be creative directors, like William \"Mickey\" Stevenson, hired by Berry Gordy, at the Motown record label.\nTape recording.\nIn 1947, the American market gained audio recording onto magnetic tape. At the record industry's 1880s dawn, rather, recording was done by phonograph, etching the sonic waveform vertically \"into\" a cylinder. By the 1930s, a gramophone etched it laterally \"across\" a disc. Constrained in tonal range, whether bass or treble, and in dynamic range, records made a grand, concert piano sound like a small, upright piano, and maximal duration was four and a half minutes. Selections and performance were often altered accordingly, and playing this disc\u2014the wax master\u2014destroyed it. The finality often caused anxiety that restrained performance to prevent error. In the 1940s, during World War II, the Germans refined audio recording onto magnetic tape\u2014uncapping recording duration and allowing immediate playback, rerecording, and editing\u2014a technology that premised emergence of record producers in their current roles.\nMultitrack recording.\nEarly in the recording industry, a record was attained by simply having all of the artists perform together live in one take. In 1945, by recording a musical element while playing a previously recorded record, Les Paul developed a recording technique called \"sound on sound\". By this, the final recording could be built piece by piece and tailored, effecting an editing process. In one case, Paul produced a song via 500 recorded discs. But, besides the tedium of this process, it serially degraded the sound quality of previously recorded elements, rerecorded as ambient sound. Yet in 1948, Paul adopted tape recording, enabling true multitrack recording by a new technique, \"overdubbing\".\nTo enable overdubbing, Paul revised the tape recorder itself by adding a second playback head, and terming it the \"preview head\". Joining the preexisting recording head, erase head, and playback head, the preview head allows the artist to hear the extant recording over headphones playing it in synchrony, \"in sync\", with the present performance being recorded alone on an isolated track. This isolation of multiple tracks enables countless mixing possibilities. Producers began recording initially only the \"bed tracks\"\u2014the rhythm section, including the bassline, drums, and rhythm guitar\u2014whereas vocals and instrument solos could be added later. A horn section, for example, could record a week later, and a string section another week later. A singer could perform her own backup vocals, or a guitarist could play 15 layers.\nElectronic instruments.\nAcross the 1960s, popular music increasingly switched from acoustic instruments, like piano, upright bass, acoustic guitar, and brass instruments, to electronic instruments, like electric guitars, keyboards, and synthesizers, employing instrument amplifiers and speakers. These could mimic acoustic instruments or create utterly new sounds. Soon, by combining the capabilities of tape, multitrack recording, and electronic instruments, producers like Phil Spector, George Martin, and Joe Meek rendered sounds unattainable live. Similarly, in jazz fusion, Teo Macero, producing Miles Davis's 1970 album \"Bitches Brew\", spliced sections of extensive improvisation sessions.\nPerformer-producer.\nIn the 1960s, rock acts like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Kinks produced some of their own songs, although many such songs are officially credited to specialist producers. Yet especially influential was the Beach Boys, whose band leader Brian Wilson took over from his father Murry within a couple of years after the band's commercial breakthrough. By 1964, Wilson had taken Spector's techniques to unseen sophistication. Wilson alone produced all Beach Boys recordings between 1963 and 1967. Using multiple studios and multiple attempts of instrumental and vocal tracks, Wilson selected the best combinations of performance and audio quality, and used tape editing to assemble a composite performance.\nDigital production.\nThe 1980s advent of digital processes and formats rapidly replaced analog processes and formats, namely, tape and vinyl. Although recording onto quality tape, at least half an inch wide and traveling 15 inches per second, had limited \"tape hiss\" to silent sections, digital's higher signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, abolished it. Digital also imparted to the music a perceived \"pristine\" sound quality, if also a loss of analog recordings' perceived \"warm\" quality and better-rounded bass. Yet whereas editing tape media requires physically locating the target audio on the ribbon, cutting there, and splicing pieces, editing digital media offers inarguable advantages in ease, efficiency, and possibilities.\nIn the 1990s, digital production reached affordable home computers via production software. By now, recording and mixing are often centralized in DAWs, digital audio workstations\u2014for example, Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Ableton, Cubase, Reason, and FL Studio\u2014for which plugins, by third parties, effect virtual studio technology. DAWs fairly standard in the industry are Logic Pro and Pro Tools. Physical devices involved include the main mixer, MIDI controllers to communicate among equipment, the recording device itself, and perhaps effects gear that is outboard. Yet literal recording is sometimes still analog, onto tape, whereupon the raw recording is converted to a digital signal for processing and editing, as some producers still find audio advantages to recording onto tape.\nConventionally, tape is more forgiving of overmodulation, whereby dynamic peaks exceed the maximal recordable signal level: tape's limitation, a physical property, is magnetic capacity, which tapers off, smoothing the overmodulated waveform even at a signal nearly 15 decibels too \"hot\", whereas a digital recording is ruined by harsh distortion of \"clipping\" at any overshoot. In digital recording, however, a recent advancement, 32-bit float, enables DAWs to undo clipping. Still, some criticize digital instruments and workflows for excess automation, allegedly impairing creative or sonic control. In any case, as production technology has drastically changed, so have the knowledge demands, although DAWs enables novices, even teenagers at home, to learn production independently. Some have attained professional competence before ever working with an artist.\nWomen in producing.\nAmong female record producers, Sylvia Moy was the first at Motown, Gail Davies the first on Nashville's Music Row, and Ethel Gabriel, with RCA, the first at a major record label. Lillian McMurry, owning Trumpet Records, produced influential blues records. Meanwhile, Wilma Cozart Fine produced hundreds of records for Mercury Records' classical division. For classical production, three women have won Grammy awards, and Judith Sherman's 2015 win was her fifth. Yet in nonclassical, no woman has won Producer of the Year, awarded since 1975 and only one even nominated for a record not her own, Linda Perry. After Lauren Christy's 2004 nomination, Linda Perry's 2019 nomination was the next for a woman. On why no woman had ever won it, Perry commented, \"I just don't think there are that many women interested.\" In the U.K., Lynsey de Paul was an early female record producer, having produced both of her Ivor Novello award-winning songs.\nAcross the decades, many female artists have produced their own music. For instance, artists Kate Bush, Madonna, Mariah Carey, Shakira, Janet Jackson, Beyonc\u00e9 (even that of Destiny's Child and the Carters), Lana Del Rey, Taylor Swift, and Lorde have produced or coproduced and Ariana Grande who produces and arranges her vocals as well as being an audio engineer. Still among specialists, despite some prominent women, including Missy Elliott in hip hop and Sylvia Massy in rock, the vast majority have been men. Early in the 2010s, asked for insights that she herself had gleaned as a woman who has specialized successfully in the industry, Wendy Page remarked, \"The difficulties are usually very short-lived. Once people realize that you can do your job, sexism tends to lower its ugly head.\" Still, when tasked to explain her profession's sex disparity, Page partly reasoned that record labels, dominated by men, have been, she said, \"mistrustful of giving a woman the reins of an immense, creative project like making a record.\" Ultimately, the reasons are multiple and not fully clear, although prominently proposed factors include types of sexism and scarcity of female role models in the profession.\nIn January 2018, a research team led by Stacy L. Smith, founder and director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, based in the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, issued a report, estimating that in the prior several years, about 2% of popular songs' producers were female. Also that month, \"Billboard\" magazine queried, \"Where are all the female music producers?\" Upon the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative's second annual report, released in February 2019, its department at USC reported, \"2018 saw an outcry from artists, executives and other music industry professionals over the lack of women in music\" and \"the plight of women in music\", where women were allegedly being \"stereotyped, sexualized, and shut out\". Also in February 2019, the Recording Academy's Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion announced an initiative whereby over 200 artists and producers\u2014ranging from Cardi B and Taylor Swift to Maroon 5 and Quincy Jones\u2014agreed to consider at least two women for each producer or engineer position. The academy's website, \"Grammy.com\", announced, \"This initiative is the first step in a broader effort to improve those numbers and increase diversity and inclusion for all in the music industry.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Over his seven-decade career, Alexander wrote 48 books, and his work has been translated into 20 languages. His most famous work is \"The Chronicles of Prydain\", a series of five high fantasy novels whose conclusion, \"The High King\", was awarded the 1969 Newbery Medal for excellence in American children's literature. He won U.S. National Book Awards in 1971 and 1982. \nAlexander grew up in Pennsylvania during the Great Depression. He developed a passion for reading books and writing poetry. He attended college for only one term, believing that there was nothing more college could teach him. He enlisted in the United States Army and rose to be a staff sergeant in intelligence and counter-intelligence. He met his wife while he was stationed in France and studied French literature at the University of Paris. After returning to the United States with his new family, he struggled to make a living from writing until he published \"And Let the Credit Go\" (1955), his first autobiographical novel. His interest in Welsh mythology led to the publication of \"The Chronicles of Prydain\". \nAlexander was nominated twice for the international Hans Christian Andersen Award, and received the 1971 National Book Award for Children's Books for \"The Marvelous Misadventures of Sebastian\" and the 1982 National Book Award for \"Westmark\". Alexander received three lifetime achievement awards before his death in 2007. The Harold B. Lee Library at Brigham Young University contains a permanent Lloyd Alexander exhibit that showcases several items from his home office including his desk, typewriter, and manuscripts and editions of his books.\nEarly life and education.\nAlexander was born in Philadelphia on January 30, 1924, to Edna (n\u00e9e Chudley) and Alan Audley Alexander, and grew up in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, a section of Upper Darby, just west of the city. He had an elder sister, Florence. His parents only read newspapers, but they did buy books \"at the Salvation Army to fill up empty shelves\". He taught himself to read around age four and skipped grades one and two at a private Quaker school. He and his friends played war, using equipment from World War I in their games. After his father Alan, a stockbroker, bankrupted in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Alexander attended public school, where he skipped yet another grade, entering seventh grade at age nine. Alexander read Shakespeare, Dickens, Mark Twain and myths, especially King Arthur. In addition to being interested in art, at age thirteen, Alexander wanted to become an Episcopal priest; however, his family could not afford to send him to divinity school. Passionate about writing, Alexander believed he could preach and worship God through his writing and his art. In high school, he began writing romantic poetry modeled after the work of nineteenth-century poets and narrative short stories, but he failed to acquire interest from publishers. His parents found him a job as a bank messenger, which inspired a satire that would become his first book published fifteen years later, \"And Let the Credit Go\" (1955). He graduated at age sixteen in 1940 from Upper Darby High School, where he was inducted into the school's Wall of Fame in 1995.\nHe attended West Chester State Teachers College, which he left after only one term because he did not find the curriculum rigorous enough. After dropping out of college, Alexander worked for six months in the mailroom of the Atlantic Refining Company. Alexander decided that adventure was a better school for a writer than college and enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was too clumsy with artillery to be sent to the front, and the sight of blood made him faint, making him unfit to work as a medic. With no prior musical experience, he briefly played the cymbals in a marching band in Texas. Shortly after, he was transferred to serve as a chaplain's assistant. He had the opportunity to study the French language, politics, customs, and geography at Lafayette College through the army. He was later moved to Camp Ritchie, Maryland, to receive specialized intelligence training in the United States Army Combat Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence Corps. At Camp Ritchie, Alexander rose to the rank of Staff Sergeant. There he met war veterans, scholars, refugees, and members of the Cherokee tribe. He rose to be a staff sergeant in the corps. \nAlexander was stationed in Wales and England briefly and then was assigned to the 7th Army in eastern France where he translated radio messages for six months. His next assignment was the Paris office of the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) where he worked as a translator and an interpreter until the end of 1945. After the war, Alexander attended the University of Paris where he studied French literature and was fascinated by the poetry of Paul \u00c9luard. Alexander called \u00c9luard on the phone and showed him his English translations of \u00c9luard's work. \u00c9luard immediately named Alexander his sole English translator. Alexander also contacted Gertrude Stein, who advised him that becoming a writer was a difficult and discouraging process. In Paris, he met Janine Denni, who had a young daughter named Madeleine. Alexander and Denni were married on January 8, 1946, and soon moved to Philadelphia. The three moved into the attic of his parents' home where Alexander spent twelve hours a day translating \u00c9luard's works and writing his own.\nWriting career.\nFor about fifteen years in Philadelphia, Alexander wrote primarily fiction, non-fiction, and translations for adults. Desperate for a job, he worked as a potter's apprentice for his sister. At the end of 1948, he started writing advertising copy, and he began to receive more royalties for his translations, leading him to purchase a house for his family in Kellytown. However, he lost his job after three months, requiring his wife to take up employment in a textile mill to make ends meet. Alexander continued to write diligently, though no publishers bought his novels for seven years.\nOne of his short stories, \"The Fantastic Symphony\" (1949), published in the \"New Directions Annual\", was a surrealistic piece inspired by Berlioz's notes on the \"Symphonie fantastique\". Alexander's breakthrough came with his novel \"And Let the Credit Go\" (1955), his first autobiographical work, in which he focused on his experience as a bank messenger in his adolescence. He wrote his second novel, \"My Five Tigers\" (1956), about his cats, continuing the trend of writing about subjects familiar to him. He found work as a copyeditor and a cartoonist where he finished his last four adult publications. He wrote two semi-autobiographical novels: \"Janine is French\" (1959) and \"My Love Affair with Music\" (1960). Alexander co-authored \"Park Avenue Vet\" (1960) with Louis Camuti, who specialized in treating cats. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals subsequently commissioned their history, which Alexander wrote as \"Fifty Years in the Doghouse\" (1964). During that time he wrote two non-fiction books for children, biographies for August Bondi and Aaron Lopez commissioned by the Jewish Publication Society, the former of which won the National Jewish Book Award in 1959. Alexander's subsequent novel was his first of the fantasy genre: \"Time Cat\" (1963). He later called it \"the most creative and liberating experience of my life\". The novel imagines a cat who can visit its other lives in different time periods, which Alexander researched extensively. \"Fifty Years in the Doghouse\" (1964; reprinted as \"Send for Ryan\") told stories of how William Michael Ryan saved animals as part of his job as a special agent for the ASPCA.\nAlmost forty years old, he then specialized in children's fantasy, the genre of his best-known works. His wartime tenure in Wales introduced him to castles and scenery that would inspire settings for many of his books. Alexander was particularly fascinated with Welsh mythology, especially the \"Mabinogion\". The plot for \"The Book of Three\" is based on a fragment from the \"Myvyrian Archaiology\". Alexander signed a book deal with Henry Holt and Company for a trilogy called \"The Sons of Llyr\". Alexander resisted simplifying the Welsh names, stating that they gave the book a certain mood and strangeness. After the release of the first novel, \"The Book of Three\" (1964), the series became known as \"The Chronicles of Prydain\". The second book of the series, \"The Black Cauldron\", followed in 1965. After beginning the third book, \"The Castle of Llyr\" (1966), Alexander decided his story needed to be told in four books, not three, and he planned his fourth and final novel, \"The High King of Prydain\". During this time he also worked at the \"Delaware Valley Announcer\" as an associate editor. After having a near-death experience, Alexander hastily finished \"The High King\", concerned he would be unable to finish his saga. However, his editor, Ann Durell, suggested that he write a fourth book in between \"The Castle of Llyr\" and \"The High King\" (1968); this book became \"Taran Wanderer\" (1967). The five novels detail the adventures of a young man named Taran, who dreams of being a sword-bearing hero but has only the title of Assistant Pig-Keeper. He progresses from youth to maturity and must finally choose whether to be High King of Prydain. Alexander also wrote two spin-off children's books from the Prydain series, \"Coll and His White Pig\" (1965) and \"The Truthful Harp\" (1967). Alexander won the Newbery Medal for \"The High King\" in 1969. \nAlexander's novel \"The Marvelous Misadventures of Sebastian\" (1970) was rejected after its first submission, and he rewrote it three times before it was published. It won the National Book Award in 1971. He published two picture books: \"The King's Fountain\" (1971), for which he collaborated with the author Ezra Jack Keats, and \"The Four Donkeys\" (1972). He wrote the novel \"The Cat Who Wished to be a Man\" in 1973. The same year Alexander published \"The Foundling: And Other Tales of Prydain\", a companion book to the Prydain series. After the success of \"Prydain\", Alexander was author-in-residence at Temple University from 1970 to 1974. He once described it as being educational for him and \"rather like being a visiting uncle, who has a marvelous time with his nephews and nieces, then goes off leaving the parents to cope with attacks of whooping cough, mending socks and blackmailing the kids to straighten up the mess in their rooms.\" Alexander wrote \"The Wizard in the Tree\" while suffering from depression and published it in 1975. The character Arbican was based on Alexander and his personal struggles. In 1977 he published \"The Town Cats\", which received a more favorable critical reception than \"The Wizard in the Tree\". His next book, \"The First Two Lives of Lukas-Kasha\", set in a fantasy world based on 15th century Persia, was published in 1978. It won the Silver Slate Pencil Award in Holland and the Austrian Book Award in Austria.\nAlexander's other fiction series are \"Westmark\" (1981 to 1984) and \"Vesper Holly\" (1987 to 1990 and 2005). \"Westmark\" features a former printer's apprentice involved in the rebellion and civil war in a fictional European kingdom around 1800. Vesper Holly is a wealthy and brilliant Philadelphia orphan who has adventures in various fictional countries during the 1870s. There was some controversy about \"The Fortune-Tellers\" (1992), a picture book illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman. Some felt that the story was European in origin and therefore inappropriate for its African setting. Alexander's last novel, \"The Golden Dream of Carlo Chuchio\", was published in August 2007. \nAlexander helped create the children's literary magazine \"Cricket\" and served on its editorial board. He served on the library committee of \"World Book Encyclopedia\" in 1974 and in the board of directors in the Friends of the International Board on Books for Young People in 1982. Alexander maintained a rigorous working schedule, awakening at 4 a.m. and working until the late afternoon, afterwards enjoying his sole meal with his wife. He adhered to this routine even when he did not feel inspired, stating that he could not rely on inspiration alone. He corresponded with fans, who on occasion visited him in his home.\nAlexander died on May 17, 2007, of cancer, a few weeks after the death of his wife of sixty-one years. His stepdaughter, Madeleine Khalil, had predeceased both him and her mother in 1995. He was survived by his five step-grandchildren and five step-great-grandchildren. He is buried at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill.\nThemes and style.\nThe Prydain Chronicles are set in a fantasy world that has much in common with Welsh folklore and mythology. Critics called the chronicles \"one of the most important and compelling examples of Welsh mythopoesis to date.\" According to \"Dictionary of Literary Biography\", Alexander's books had \"the special depth and insight provided by characters who not only act but think, feel and struggle with the same kinds of problems that confuse and trouble people in the twentieth century.\" Some Arthurian scholars argue that Alexander took too many liberties with the material, creating works that are \"too contemporary\". Alexander described his own writings as based on myth, but written with his personal life experience, or \"micromythology\". C. W. Sullivan, a professor of Northern European mythology at East Carolina University, stated that Alexander took the structure of a fairy tale, or \"m\u00e4rchen\", and added Welsh details. Brian Attebery wrote that \"The Book of Three\" was \"no more than a clever imitation of Tolkien\", but noted that Taran, written by an American, finds his identity in the future, not the past. Attebery described Alexander's mythopoeism as a \"modest\" success, bringing his own creativity to Welsh mythology. Mark Oziewicz, a professor specializing in young adult fantasy, wrote that the Prydain Chronicles show the importance of connecting the present to the past. Taran learns firsthand the importance of stories when he encounters the characters from them, who are often nothing like he imagined. Throughout the series, he must trust the knowledge of authority figures when he takes on quests he does not initially understand. The gradual transformation of Prydain from magical to mundane mirrors Taran's coming-of-age. The way the series starts in the past but comments on the future is reminiscent of Welsh \"hanesion\" narrative, which returns to the past in order to heal the present. Alexander's biographer, Jill May, along with critic Normal Bagnall, noted several American themes in the Prydain series: that leadership is an ability, not inherited, and that anyone can become a hero. Bagnall further elucidated that Taran's character development was American, with him growing from an inarticulate, self-conscious teen into a self-educated, self-sacrificing adult. In contrast, Kath Filmer-Davies from the University of Queensland argues that the Welshness of the Prydain Chronicles is responsible for much of their appeal. She noted that in Welsh culture, Taran's knowledge and nationalism are more important than his non-noble family status.\nAlexander's works are usually coming-of-age novels in fantasy settings where characters fulfill quests. The main characters are common people who return to their regular lives after their quests. While his settings are inspired by fairy tales and legends, his stories are modern. Self-acceptance and awareness are vital for the protagonists to grow. Alexander's works are fundamentally optimistic about human nature, with endings that are hopeful rather than tragic. He stated that in his fantasy world, \"good is ultimately stronger than evil\" and \"courage, justice, love, and mercy actually function\". The Prydain Chronicles deal with themes of good and evil and what it means to be a hero. The Westmark Trilogy also explores good and evil and shows how corrupt leadership can lead to unrest and revolution. The main character, Theo, reluctantly joins the army in an unexpected war, subverting typical war heroics. The books are appealing adventure stories that simultaneously discuss ethical issues, a quality that critic Hazel Rochman praised in \"School Library Journal\". Writing at \"The Horn Book\", Mary M. Burns stated that \"The Illyrian Adventure\" was excellent because it was believable while being a fantasy and had a strong underlying theme. Alexander himself remarked that his \"own concerns and questions\" still came out in his fiction. He consciously used fantasy stories as a way to understand reality.\nAlexander strove to create women characters who were more than a passive trophy for the hero. Rodney Fierce, a history professor, analyzes Eilonwy's agency and character over the five books in the Prydain Chronicles. While she is independent and assertive in \"The Book of Three\", other characters view her adventuring in \"The High King\" as unladylike, consistently dismissing her useful advice. Taran only becomes attracted to her when she is wearing fancy feminine clothes, while Eilonwy's affections do not rely on Taran being luxuriously accoutered. In \"The Castle of Llyr\", Taran commands her not to leave the castle but cannot tell her why, leaving readers to feel that his controlling behavior is noble. His secrecy is only vital to make Eilonwy a helpless victim, which will allow Taran to rescue her. In fighting the enchantress who conquered her ancestral home in Caer Colur, Eilonwy destroys her and the castle that would rightfully be hers. After the destruction of her home castle, Eilonwy's desire shifts from being focused on her own development to waiting to marry Taran. Even though Taran decides he would rather stay in Prydain than be with Eilonwy, Eilonwy gives up her magical power to marry Taran and stay with him in Prydain. Fierce concludes that, unlike other women in fantasy fiction, at least Eilonwy made the decision herself to lose her magical powers. Sullivan noted how Taran's rise to power symbolizes an \"age of male dominance\", contrasting Prydain's previous age of women in power. In 1985, Lois Kuznets argued that the Prydain chronicles do not achieve American ideals because Taran becomes a king rather than a president, and Eilonwy does not \"achieve womanhood\". Alexander's biographer, Jill May, rebutted this argument, stating that when Alexander wrote the books in the 1960s, his audience was just beginning to accept feminist ideas, and his works need to be considered in their historical context. One critic, John Rowe Townsend, disliked the \"two-dimensional\" and \"predictable\" characters of Taran and Eilonwy.\nSeveral critics have commented on Alexander's writing style. In a \"Horn Book\" review of the Vesper Holly books, Ethel L. Heins stated that Alexander's writing was \"elegant, witty, [and] beautifully paced\". Reviewers praised the action scenes in the Prydain chronicles, stating that they involved the reader in the scene without gruesome detail. Jill P. May stated that his prose changes depending on the goal of his work. While his fantasy style has been compared to J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, his later writings have a completely different style. His first work for children, a biography of Jewish freedom fighter August Bondi, had little dialogue, perhaps in an effort to be faithful to historical sources. The fictional characters stood out more than Bondi's. Alexander wrote another biography for the Jewish Publication Society on Aaron Lopez. In absence of detailed historical sources, Alexander fictionalized more events in this work, with Lopez's fictional attitudes mirroring Alexander's.\nAwards and honors.\nAlexander first garnered significant critical acclaim with his \"The Chronicles of Prydain\" series. The second volume (\"The Black Cauldron\") was a runner-up for the 1966 Newbery Medal; the fourth (\"Taran Wanderer\") was a \"School Library Journal\" Best Book of the Year; the fifth and concluding volume (\"The High King\") won the 1969 Newbery. Alexander was included in the 1972 third volume of the H. W. Wilson reference series, \"Book of Junior Authors and Illustrators\"\u2014early in his career as a children's writer, but after \"Prydain\" was complete. For his contribution as a children's writer, Alexander was U.S. nominee in 1996 and again in 2008 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest recognition available to creators of children's books. Many of Alexander's later books received awards; \"The Marvelous Misadventures of Sebastian\" won the 1971 National Book Award in category Children's Books and in 1982, \"Westmark\" also won a National Book Award.\n\"The Fortune-Tellers\", illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman, won the 1992\nBoston Globe\u2013Horn Book Award in the Picture Book category. The American Library Association selected \"The Beggar Queen\" as one of the best books for young adults in 1984, and \"The Illyrian Adventure\" as a \"notable book\" in 1986. \nHe received at least three lifetime achievement awards.\nIn 1991, the Free Library of Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Center for the Book awarded him the Pennbook Lifetime Achievement Award.\nIn 2001, he received the inaugural Parents' Choice Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award.\nIn 2003, Alexander received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement.\nOn January 28, 2010, an exhibit opened at the Harold B. Lee Library on the campus of Brigham Young University, displaying several items from Alexander's home office, which he referred to as \"the Box\". Items include manuscripts, editions of all his books, his violin, typewriter, and desk. On October 19, 2012, a documentary chronicling the life and writings of Alexander was released. The film is titled \"Lloyd Alexander\". On September 23, 2014, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the series, Henry Holt published a special \"50th Anniversary Edition\" of \"The Book of Three\".\n* \"The Book of Three\" (1964)\n* \"The Black Cauldron\" (1965), winner of the 1966 Newbery Honor\n* \"The Castle of Llyr\" (1966)\n* \"Taran Wanderer\" (1967)\n* \"The High King\" (1968), winner of the 1969 Newbery Medal\n* \"Coll and His White Pig\" (1965), picture book\n* \"The Truthful Harp\" (1967), picture book\n* \"The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain\" (1973, expanded 1999)\n* \"Westmark\" (1981)\u2014National Book Award\n* \"The Kestrel\" (1982)\n* \"The Beggar Queen\" (1984)\n* \"The Illyrian Adventure\" (1986)\n* \"The El Dorado Adventure\" (1987)\n* \"The Drackenberg Adventure\" (1988)\n* \"The Jedera Adventure\" (1989)\n* \"The Philadelphia Adventure\" (1990)\n* \"The Xanadu Adventure\" (2005)\n* \"And Let the Credit Go\" (1955)\u2014autobiographical first novel\n* \"My Five Tigers\" (1956)\n* \"Border Hawk: August Bondi\" (1958)\u2014biography of August Bondi for children\n* \"Janine is French\" (1960)\u2014Alexander also collaborated to write a stage adaptation of this \n* \"My Love Affair with Music\" (1960)\n* \"The Flagship Hope: Aaron Lopez\" (1960)\u2014biography of Aaron Lopez for children\n* \"Park Avenue Vet\" (1962), by Alexander and Dr. Louis J.

{"id": "53210", "revid": "41068046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53210", "title": "Marion Zimmer Bradley", "text": "American author (1930\u20131999)\nMarion Eleanor Zimmer Bradley (June 3, 1930 \u2013 September 25, 1999) was an American author of fantasy, historical fantasy, science fiction, and science fantasy novels and is best known for the Arthurian fiction novel \"The Mists of Avalon\" and the \"Darkover\" series. She was noted for the female perspective in her writing, something before little-seen in Sword and Sorcery fantasy.\nBradley began writing at the age of 17 and later graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hardin-Simmons University. She co-founded the Society for Creative Anachronism in 1966. She also served as the editor of the long-running \"Sword and Sorceress\" anthology series. She was posthumously awarded the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 2000.\nThough Bradley remained popular during her lifetime, her reputation was posthumously marred when in 2014 her daughter reported that Bradley had sexually abused her, and allegedly assisted her second husband, convicted child abuser Walter Breen, in his own grooming and sexual abuse of multiple unrelated children. Many science fiction authors have since publicly condemned Bradley.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPersonal life.\nBorn Marion Eleanor Zimmer on June 3, 1930, she lived on a farm in Albany, New York, and began writing at the age of 17. She was married to Robert Alden Bradley from October 26, 1949, until their divorce on May 19, 1964. They had a son, David Robert Bradley (1950\u20132008). During the 1950s she was introduced to lesbian advocacy organization the Daughters of Bilitis.\nAfter her divorce, Bradley married numismatist Walter H. Breen on June 3, 1964. They had a daughter, Moira Greyland, who is a professional harpist and singer, and a son, Mark Greyland. Moira's son, RJ Stern, is a college football player who was featured on season 5 of \"Last Chance U\" on Netflix.\nIn 1965, Bradley graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas. Afterward, she moved to Berkeley, California, to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley between 1965 and 1967. In 1966, with her brother Paul Edwin Zimmer, she helped found and name the Society for Creative Anachronism and was involved in developing several local groups, some in New York after her move to Staten Island. In particular, she and Breen founded and served as the first directors for the Kingdom of the East.\nBradley and Breen separated in 1979 but remained married. They also continued a business relationship and lived on the same street for over a decade. They officially divorced on May 9, 1990, the year Breen was arrested on child molestation charges after a 13-year-old boy reported that Breen had been molesting him for four years. She had edited Breen's book \"Greek Love\" (published pseudonymously), which was dedicated to her (named simply as \"[his] wife\"), and in 1965 had contributed an article, \"Feminine Equivalents of Greek Love in Modern Literature\", to Breen's journal \"The International Journal of Greek Love\". She allegedly was told of Breen's abuse of a minor by her secretary and \"she was extremely upset\" and immediately divorced him.\nLiterary career.\nEarly work.\nBradley stated that when she was a child she enjoyed reading adventure fantasy authors such as Henry Kuttner, Edmond Hamilton, C.L. Moore, and Leigh Brackett, especially when they wrote about \"the glint of strange suns on worlds that never were and never would be\". Her first novel and much of her subsequent work show their influence strongly. At 17, she began her first novel \"The Forest House\", her retelling of \"Norma\"; she finished it before her death.\nBradley made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in \"Amazing Stories\" in 1949 with the short story \"Outpost\". \"Outpost\" was published in \"Amazing Stories\" Vol. 23, No. 12, the December 1949 issue; it had previously appeared in the fanzine \"Spacewarp\" Vol. 4, No. 3, in December 1948. Her first professional publication was a short story \"Women Only\", which appeared in the second (and final) issue of \"Vortex Science Fiction\" in 1953. Her first published novel-length work was \"Falcons of Narabedla\", first published in the May 1957 issue of \"Other Worlds\".\nGay and lesbian pulp fiction.\nEarly in her career, writing as Morgan Ives, Miriam Gardner, John Dexter, and Lee Chapman, Bradley produced several works outside the speculative fiction genre, including gay and lesbian pulp fiction novels; \"I Am a Lesbian\" was published in 1962. Though relatively tame by today's standards, her novels were considered pornographic when published.\nDarkover.\nHer 1958 novel \"The Planet Savers\" introduced the planet of Darkover, which became the setting of a popular series by Bradley and other authors. The Darkover milieu is a science fantasy fictional world, with science fiction as well as fantasy overtones: Darkover is a lost human colony where psi powers developed to an unusual degree, and work like magic, while technology has regressed to a more-or-less medieval stage. Bradley wrote many Darkover novels by herself, but in her later years collaborated with other authors for publication; her literary collaborators have continued the series since her death.\nEncouraging fan interaction.\nBradley took an active role in science fiction and fantasy fandom, promoting interaction with professional authors and publishers and making several important contributions to the subculture. In her teens she wrote letters to the pulp magazines of the time, such as the above-mentioned \"Amazing Stories\" and \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\". Starting in the late 1940s and continuing in the 1950s and 1960s, she published her own fanzines, including \"Astra's Tower\", \"Day*Star\", and \"Anything Box\". She also co-edited fanzines, including \"Ugly Bird\" with Redd Boggs, \"MEZRAB\" with her first husband Robert Bradley, and \"Allerlei\" with her second husband Walter Breen. Bradley contributed to several other fanzines, including \"The Gorgon\" and \"The Nekromantikon\".\nFor many years, Bradley actively encouraged Darkover fan fiction. She encouraged submissions from unpublished authors and reprinted some of it in commercial Darkover anthologies. This ended after a dispute with a fan over an unpublished Darkover novel of Bradley's that had similarities to one of the fan's stories. As a result, the novel remained unpublished and Bradley demanded the cessation of all Darkover fan fiction.\nTolkien fandom.\nIn the 1970s, as part of the contemporary wave of enthusiasm for J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth, she wrote an essay about \u00c9owyn's supposed love for the hero Aragorn called \"Of Men, Halflings, and Hero Worship\" for the \"Astra's Tower\" fanzine. She also penned two short fanfic stories about Arwen, publishing them in chapbook format. One story, \"The Jewel of Arwen\" (originally published in a different form in the fanzine \"I Palantir\" #2, August 1961), appeared in her professional anthology \"The Best of Marion Zimmer Bradley\" (1985), but was dropped from later reprints. She continued to contribute to different science fiction and fantasy fanzines and magazines throughout her career.\nOther work.\nIn 1966, Bradley became a co-founder of the Society for Creative Anachronism and is credited with coining the name of that group.\nBradley was the editor of the long-running \"Sword and Sorceress\" anthology series, which encouraged submissions of fantasy stories featuring original and non-traditional heroines from young and upcoming authors. Although she particularly encouraged young female authors, she was not averse to including stories from men in her anthologies. Mercedes Lackey was one of many authors who first appeared in the anthologies. Bradley also maintained a large family of writers at her home in Berkeley, California. Following Bradley's death, the anthology was edited by Elizabeth Waters and continued until 2019.\nHer most famous single novel may be \"The Mists of Avalon\", a retelling of the Camelot legend from the point of view of Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar. It grew into a series of books and, like the Darkover series, the later novels are written with or by other authors and have continued to appear since Bradley's death.\nBradley was posthumously awarded the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 2000.\nChild sex abuse allegations.\nIn 2000, shortly after Bradley's death, author Stephen Goldin, the stepfather of a boy who had been molested by Walter Breen, started a website claiming that Bradley had been fully aware of her husband's crimes and made no effort to report them or protect his victims. However, Elizabeth Waters, Bradley's secretary, claimed that she was the first one who told Bradley and that Bradley \"was extremely upset\" at the news.\nIn 2014, Moira Greyland, the daughter of Bradley and Breen, accused Bradley of sexual abuse from the age of 3 to 12. In an email to \"The Guardian,\" Greyland said that she had not spoken out before because \"I thought that my mother's fans would be angry with me for saying anything against someone who had championed women's rights and made so many of them feel differently about themselves and their lives. I didn't want to hurt anyone she had helped, so I just kept my mouth shut\".\nGreyland also confirmed Goldin's statements by saying that Bradley was aware of her husband's behavior and chose not to report him. Greyland reported that she was not the only victim and that she was one of the people who reported her father for child molestation, for which he received multiple convictions.\nIn December 2017, Bradley's daughter published a detailed biography of her mother, including her pedophilia and sexual abuse, in a book entitled \"The Last Closet: The Dark Side of Avalon\".\nAdditionally, according to Greyland, Bradley assisted Breen (her husband at the time) in accessing and abusing multiple unrelated young boys, knowing he was a pedophile who was engaging in sexual contact with children as young as eight. Greyland states that Bradley and her live-in female partner (whom Greyland refers to as her step-mother) both admitted to knowledge of the abuse and purposefully avoided investigating, questioning, or notifying any authorities. Bradley was also accused of attempting to adopt a child whom Breen was interested in sexually.\nIn response to these allegations, on July 2, 2014, Victor Gollancz Ltd, the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, began donating all income from the sales of Bradley's e-books to the charity Save the Children. Janni Lee Simner donated advances and royalties from her two \"Darkover\" short stories and, at the request of her husband, Larry Hammer, payment for his sale to Bradley's magazine, to the American anti-sexual assault organization Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network.\nA number of science fiction authors have publicly condemned Bradley. Among the first was John Scalzi, who expressed his horror within a day of the allegations being made public. Hugo Award winner Jim C. Hines wrote that Bradley's positive effect on her readers and fellow authors \"makes the revelations about Marion Zimmer Bradley protecting a known child rapist and molesting her own daughter and others even more tragic.\" G Willow Wilson, who, along with Bradley, is a fellow World Fantasy Award winner, said she was \"speechless\". Diana L. Paxson, who collaborated with Bradley on a number of novels and who continued to write novels set in the Avalon Series after Bradley's death, said that she was \"shocked and appalled to read Moira Greyland's posts about her mother... I never personally observed, nor had any reason to suspect, that (Bradley) was abusing either of her children.\"\nReligion.\nWhile she was attending the College for Teachers (now University at Albany, SUNY) in Albany, Bradley became involved in Western esoteric tradition. She later completed a Rosicrucian correspondence course.\nIn the late 1950s or early 1960s, Bradley and Walter H. Breen founded the Aquarian Order of the Restoration based on the work of Dion Fortune. By 1961 she was formally initiating others, including Ramfis S. Firethorn.\nBradley was active in Darkmoon Circle, which was founded in 1978 by several women who were members of her Aquarian Order of the Restoration. Bradley renovated her garage to provide a meeting room for Darkmoon Circle as well as for other local Pagan groups. In 1981 Bradley, Diana L. Paxson, and Elisabeth Waters incorporated the Center for Non-Traditional Religion.\nIn the 1990s Bradley said she would return to Christianity, telling an interviewer: \"I just go regularly to the Episcopalian church ... That pagan thing ... I feel that I've gotten past it. I would like people to explore the possibilities.\"\nDeath.\nAfter suffering declining health for years, Bradley died at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a heart attack. Her ashes were later scattered at Glastonbury Tor in Somerset, England.\nWorks.\nOther works.\nBradley created several different fanzines, including \"The Anything Box\" (2 issues, 1959), \"Astra's Tower\" (5 issues, 1947\u201350), \"Astra's Tower, Special Leaflet\" (5 issues, 1952\u201362), \"Day*Star\" (28 issues, 1954\u201372), \"Fantasy Ambler\" (1 issue, 1962), \"Gemini, Jr.\" (1 issue, 1951), \"Gemini FAPA\" (3 issues, 1951\u201360), \"On the Ragged Edge\" (1 issue, undated), and \"Catch Trap\" (at least issues 89\u2013106, early 1960s). She co-edited several other fanzines, including \"Allerlei\" (at least 17 issues, 1960\u201365, with Walter Breen), \"Anduril\" (1 issue, 1962, with David Bradley and Paul Zimmer), \"MEZRAB\" (7 issues, 1950\u201352, with Robert A. Bradley), and \"Ugly Bird\" (2 issues, 1956\u201359, with Redd Boggs).\nShe also contributed to \"The Ladder\" and \"The Mattachine Review\".

The present Russia\u2013United States maritime boundary is at 168\u00b0 58' 37\" W longitude, slightly south of the Arctic Circle at about 65\u00b0 40' N latitude. The Strait is named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born Russian explorer.\nThe Bering Strait has been the subject of the scientific theory that humans migrated from Asia to North America across a land bridge known as Beringia when lower ocean levels\u00a0\u2013 a result of glaciers locking up vast amounts of water\u00a0\u2013 exposed a wide stretch of the sea floor, both at the present strait and in the shallow sea north and south of it. This view of how Paleo-Indians entered America has been the dominant one for several decades and continues to be the most accepted one. Numerous successful crossings without the use of a boat have also been recorded since at least the early 20th century.\nGeography and science.\nThe Bering Strait is about wide at its narrowest point, between Cape Dezhnev, Chukchi Peninsula, Russia, the easternmost point (169\u00b0 39' W) of the Asian continent and Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska, United States, the westernmost point (168\u00b0 05' W) of the North American continent. Its deepest point is only . It borders the Chukchi Sea (part of the Arctic Ocean) to the north and the Bering Sea to the south. The strait is a unique habitat sparsely populated by the Yupik, Inuit, and Chukchi people who have cultural and linguistic ties to each other.\nThe strait is thought to have opened 4.8-7.4 million years ago.\u00a0It is believed that the narrowing of the strait 900,000 years ago could be one of the reasons for increasing the duration of the ice age.\nExpeditions.\nFrom at least 1562, European geographers thought that there was a Strait of Ani\u00e1n between Asia and North America. In 1648, Semyon Dezhnyov probably passed through the strait, but his report did not reach Europe. Danish-born Russian navigator Vitus Bering entered it in 1728. In 1732, Mikhail Gvozdev became the first European to cross it, from Asia to America. It was visited in 1778 by the third voyage of James Cook.\nAmerican vessels were hunting for bowhead whales in the strait by 1847.\nIn March 1913, Captain Max Gottschalk (German) crossed from the east cape of Siberia to Shishmaref, Alaska, on dogsled via Little and Big Diomede islands. He was the first documented modern voyager to cross from Russia to North America without the use of a boat.\nIn 1987, swimmer Lynne Cox swam a course between the Diomede Islands from Alaska to the Soviet Union in water during the last years of the Cold War. She was congratulated jointly by American president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.\nIn June and July 1989, three independent teams attempted the first modern sea-kayak crossing of the Bering Strait. The groups were: seven Alaskans, who called their effort \"Paddling Into Tomorrow\" (i.e. crossing the international dateline); a four-man British expedition, \"Kayaks Across the Bering Strait\"; and a team of Californians in a three-person baidarka, led by Jim Noyes (who launched his ambitious expedition as a paraplegic). Accompanying the Californians was a film crew in a umiak, a walrus-skin boat traditional to the region; they were filming the 1991 documentary \"Curtain of Ice\", directed by John Armstrong.\nIn March 2006, Briton Karl Bushby and French-American adventurer Dimitri Kieffer crossed the strait on foot, walking across a frozen section in 15 days. They were soon arrested for not entering Russia through a regular port of entry.\nAugust 2008 marked the first crossing of the Bering Strait using an amphibious road-going vehicle. The specially modified Land Rover Defender 110 was driven by Steve Burgess and Dan Evans across the straits on its second attempt following the interruption of the first by bad weather.\nIn February 2012, a Korean team led by Hong Sung-Taek crossed the straits on foot in six days. They started from Chukotka Peninsula, the east coast of Russia on February 23 and arrived in Wales, the western coastal town in Alaska on February 29.\nIn July 2012, six adventurers associated with \"Dangerous Waters\", a reality adventure show under production, made the crossing on Sea-Doos but were arrested and permitted to return to Alaska on their Sea-Doos after being briefly detained in Lavrentiya, the administrative center of the Chukotsky District. They were treated well and given a tour of the village's museum, but not permitted to continue south along the Pacific coast. The men had visas but the western coast of the Bering Strait is a closed military zone.\nBetween August 4 and 10 (US time), 2013, a team of 65 swimmers from 17 countries performed a relay swim across the Bering Strait, the first such swim in history. They swam from Cape Dezhnev, Russia, to Cape Prince of Wales, United States (roughly , due to the current). They had direct support from the Russian Navy, using one of its ships, and assistance with permission.\nProposed crossing.\nA physical link between Asia and North America via the Bering Strait nearly became a reality in 1864 when a Russian-American telegraph company began preparations for an overland telegraph line connecting Europe and America via the east. It was abandoned when the undersea Atlantic Cable proved successful.\nA further proposal for a bridge-and-tunnel link from eastern Russia to Alaska was made by French engineer Baron Loicq de Lobel in 1906. Czar Nicholas II of Russia issued an order authorising a Franco-American syndicate represented by de Lobel to begin work on the Trans-Siberian Alaska railroad project, but no physical work ever commenced.\nSuggestions have been made to construct a Bering Strait bridge between Alaska and Siberia. Despite the unprecedented engineering, political, and financial challenges, Russia green-lit a US$65-billion TKM-World Link tunnel project in August 2011. If completed, the tunnel would be the world's longest. China considered construction of a \"China-Russia-Canada-America\" railroad line that would include construction of a underwater tunnel that would cross the Bering Strait.\nProposed geological engineering.\nIn 1956, the Soviet Union proposed to the US a joint bi-national project to warm the Arctic Ocean and melt some of the ice cap. As designed by Petr Borisov, the Soviet project called for a dam across the Bering Strait. It would block the cold Pacific current from entering the Arctic. By pumping low-salinity cold surface water across the dam to the Pacific, warmer and higher salinity sea water from the Atlantic Ocean would be introduced into the Arctic Ocean. However, citing national security concerns, the CIA and FBI experts opposed the Soviet plan by arguing that while the plan was feasible, it would compromise NORAD and thus the dam could be built at only an immense cost. Soviet scientist D. A. Drogaytsev also opposed the idea, stating that the sea north of the dam and north-flowing rivers in Siberia would become unnavigable year round, and the Gobi and other deserts would be extended to the northern Siberia coastline.\nAmerican Charles P. Steinmetz (1865\u20131923) earlier proposed to widen the Bering Strait by removing St. Lawrence Island and parts of Seward and Chukotski Peninsulas. A strait wide would let the Japan Current melt the Arctic Ocean.\nIn the 21st century, a dam has also been proposed. However, the aim of the proposal is to preserve the Arctic ice cap against global warming.\n\"Ice Curtain\" border.\nDuring the Cold War, the Bering Strait marked the border between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Diomede Islands\u2014Big Diomede (Russia) and Little Diomede (US)\u2014are only apart. Traditionally, the indigenous people in the area had frequently crossed the border back and forth for \"routine visits, seasonal festivals and subsistence trade\", but were prevented from doing so during the Cold War. The border became known as the \"Ice Curtain\". It was completely closed, and there was no regular passenger air or boat traffic.\nSince 2012, the Russian coast of the Bering Strait has been a closed military zone. Through organized trips and the use of special permits, it is possible for foreigners to visit. All arrivals must be through an airport or a cruise port, near the Bering Strait only at Anadyr or Provideniya. Unauthorized travelers who arrive on shore after crossing the strait, even those with visas, may be arrested, imprisoned briefly, fined, deported and banned from future visas.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It consists of ten districts and 340 municipalities (including four cities) with Augsburg being the administrative capital. \nGovernance.\nThe county of Swabia is located in southwest Bavaria. It was annexed by Bavaria in 1803, is part of the historic region of Swabia and was formerly ruled by dukes of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. During the Nazi period, the area was separated from the rest of Bavaria to become the Gau Swabia. It was re-incorporated into Bavaria after the war.\nThe Regierungsbezirk is subdivided into 3 regions (\"Planungsregionen\"): Allg\u00e4u, Augsburg, and Donau-Iller. Donau-Iller also includes two districts and one city of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\nPopulation.\nHistorical population of Swabia:\nEconomy.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was \u20ac 74.8 billion in 2018, accounting for 2.2% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac 36,500 or 121% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 101% of the EU average.\nHistory.\nThe Bavarian administrative region of Swabia is the eastern part of the Duchy of Swabia. After the execution of the Swabian duke Conradin in Naples in 1268, his uncle, the Bavarian duke Louis, inherited some of Conradin's possessions in Swabia. In 1803, with the German Mediatisation, Bavaria acquired the further East Swabian territories, which were merged with Palatinate-Neuburg.\nAfter the founding of the Kingdom of Bavaria, the state was totally reorganised and, in 1808, divided into 15 administrative districts (), in Bavaria called . They were created in the fashion of the French departements, quite even in size and population, and named after their main rivers. \nIn the following years, due to territorial changes (e.g. the loss of Tyrol, the addition of the Palatinate), the number of districts was reduced to 8. The Swabian territories were merged with Palatinate-Neuburg and the new district was called (Upper Danube District). In 1837, king Ludwig I of Bavaria renamed all the districts after historical territorial names and tribes of the area. This also involved some border changes or territorial swaps. Thus the name changed to Swabia.\nIn 1945, the town of Lindau was detached from Bavaria by France, but it was reunited with the district of Swabia in 1955. In 1972, the former Swabian city Neuburg an der Donau was reunited with the district of Upper Bavaria.\nMain sites.\nMajor attractions include the capital Augsburg; several other old cities including Donauw\u00f6rth, N\u00f6rdlingen, Memmingen, Mindelheim, Kaufbeuren and Kempten; the Ottobeuren Abbey and the scenic attractions of the River Danube in the north; the Allg\u00e4u in the south; the Allg\u00e4u Alps with mount Hochfrottspitze, mount Hochvogel and Oberstdorf; and the royal castles of Hohenschwangau, Neuschwanstein and F\u00fcssen. With the district of Lindau, Bavarian Swabia has access to Lake Constance.\nFood and drink.\nSwabian cuisine is down-to-earth and rather simple. Noodle products are very important.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53214", "revid": "50899647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53214", "title": "North West England", "text": "Region of England\nNorth West England is one of nine official regions of England and consists of the ceremonial counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. The North West had a population of 7,417,397 in 2021. It is the third-most-populated region in the United Kingdom, after the South East and Greater London. The largest settlements are Manchester and Liverpool. It is one of the three regions, alongside North East England and Yorkshire and the Humber, that make up Northern England.\nSubdivisions.\nThe official region consists of the following subdivisions:\nThe region has the following sub-divisions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAfter abolition of the Greater Manchester and Merseyside County Councils in 1986, power was transferred to the metropolitan boroughs, making them equivalent to unitary authorities. In April 2011, Greater Manchester gained a top-tier administrative body in the form of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which means the 10 Greater Manchester boroughs are once again second-tier authorities.\nGeography.\nNorth West England is bounded to the east by the Pennines and to the west by the Irish Sea. The region extends from the Scottish Borders in the north to the West Midlands region in the south. To its southwest is North Wales. Amongst the better known of the North West's physiographical features are the Lake District and the Cheshire Plain. The highest point in North West England (and the highest peak in England) is Scafell Pike, Cumbria, at a height of .\nWindermere is the largest natural lake in England, while Broad Crag Tarn on Broad Crag is England's highest lake. Wast Water is England's deepest lake, being 74 metres deep.\nA mix of rural and urban landscape, two large conurbations, centred on Liverpool and Manchester, occupy much of the south of the region. The north of the region, comprising Cumbria and northern Lancashire, is largely rural, as is the far south which encompasses parts of the Cheshire Plain and Peak District.\nThe region includes parts of three National parks (all of the Lake District, and small parts of the Peak District and the Yorkshire Dales) and three areas of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (all of Arnside and Silverdale and the Solway Coast, and almost all of the Forest of Bowland).\nWeather.\nWeather in this part of England is typically classified as maritime, moist and temperate, with a moderate annual temperature range. Average annual precipitation in the UK typically ranges from approximately 800\u00a0mm to 1,400\u00a0mm. Temperatures are generally close to the national average. Cumbria usually experiences the most severe weather, with high precipitation in the mountainous regions of the Lake District and Pennines. In winter, the most severe weather occurs in the more exposed and elevated areas of the North West, once again mainly the Lake District and Pennine areas.\nDemographics.\nPopulation, density, and settlements.\n\"Source: Office for National Statistics Mid Year Population Estimates in 2008\"\nNorth West England's population accounts for just over 13% of England's overall population. 37.86% of the North West's population resides in Greater Manchester, 21.39% in Lancashire, 20.30% in Merseyside, 14.76% in Cheshire and 7.41% live in the largest county by area, Cumbria.\nEthnicity.\nAccording to 2009 Office for National Statistics estimates, 91.6% (6,323,300) of people in the region describe themselves as 'White': 88.4% (6,101,100) White British, 1.0% (67,200) White Irish and 2.2% (155,000) White Other. During the Industrial Revolution hundreds of thousands of Welsh people migrated to the North West of England to work in the coal mines. Parts with notably high populations with Welsh ancestry as a result of this include Liverpool, Chester, Skelmersdale, Widnes, Halewood, Wallasey, Ashton-in-Makerfield and Birkenhead.\nThe Mixed Race population makes up 1.3% (93,800) of the region's population. There are 323,800 South Asians, making up 4.7% of the population, and 1.1% Black (80,600). 0.6% of the population (39,900) are Chinese and 0.5% (36,500) of people belong to another ethnic group.\nNorth West England is a very diverse region, with Manchester and Liverpool amongst the most diverse cities in Europe. 19.4% of Blackburn with Darwen's population are Muslim, the third-highest among all local authorities in the United Kingdom and the highest outside London. Areas such as Moss Side in Greater Manchester are home to a 30%+ Black British population. In contrast, the town of St. Helens in Merseyside, unusually for a city area, has a very low percentage of ethnic minorities with 98% identifying as White British. The City of Liverpool, over 800 years old, is one of the few places in Britain where ethnic minority populations can be traced back over dozens of generations: being the closest major city in England to Ireland, it is home to a significant ethnic Irish population, with the city being home to one of the first ever Afro-Caribbean communities in the UK, as well as the oldest Chinatown in Europe.\nPlace of birth.\nThe table below is not how many people belong to each ethnic group (e.g. a BBC News article in 2008 claimed there are over 25,000 ethnic Italians in Manchester alone whilst only 6,000 Italian-born people live in the North West). The proportion of people residing in North West England born outside the UK was 11.7% in 2021, compared with 8.2% in 2011 and 5.1% in 2001. Below are the fifteen largest overseas-born groups in the region according to the 2021 census, alongside the two previous censuses:\nReligion.\nOne in five of the population in the North West is Catholic, a result of large-scale Irish emigration in the nineteenth century as well as the high number of English recusants in Lancashire.\nSocial deprivation.\nOf the nine regions of England, the North West has the fourth-highest GVA per capita\u2014the highest outside southern England. Despite this the region has above average multiple deprivation with wealth heavily concentrated on very affluent areas like rural Cheshire, rural Lancashire, and south Cumbria. As measured by the Indices of deprivation 2007, the region has many more Lower Layer Super Output Areas in the 20% most deprived districts than the 20% least deprived council districts. Only North East England shows more indicators of deprivation than the North West, but the number of affluent areas in the North West is very similar to Yorkshire and the Humber.\nThe most deprived local authority areas in the region (based on specific wards within those borough areas) are, in descending order\u2014Liverpool, Manchester, Knowsley, Blackpool, Salford, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Rochdale, Barrow-in-Furness, Halton, Hyndburn, Oldham, Pendle, St Helens, Preston, Bolton, Tameside, Wirral, Wigan, Copeland, Sefton, and Rossendale.\nIn 2007 when Cheshire still had district councils, the least deprived council districts in the region by council district, in descending order, were\u2014Congleton, Ribble Valley, Macclesfield, and South Lakeland. These areas have Conservative MPs, except South Lakeland has a Lib Dem and Labour MPs. At county level, before it was split into two, Cheshire was the least deprived, followed by Trafford, and by Warrington and Stockport.\nIn March 2011, the overall unemployment claimant count was 4.2% for the region. Inside the region the highest was Liverpool with 6.8%, followed by Knowsley on 6.3%, Halton with 5.5% and Rochdale with 5.1%. The lowest claimant count is in Eden (Cumbria) and Ribble Valley (Lancashire) each with 1.3%, followed by South Lakeland with 1.4%.\nElections.\nIn the 2019 general election, the Conservatives gained ten seats, from the Labour Party, with no other seats changing hands. Labour held 42 of their 52 seats, albeit many with slimmed down majorities. They remain the dominant party in the region by seat count, with the Conservatives total now standing at 27. The Conservatives made two gains in Cheshire, three gains in Lancashire, five gains in Greater Manchester, notably including Andy Burnham's former seat of Leigh.\nIn the 2017 general election, the area was dominated by the Labour Party. Fifty-five per cent of the region's electorate voted Labour, 36.3% Conservative, 5.4% Liberal Democrat, 1.9% UKIP and 1.1% Greens; however, by number of parliamentary seats, Labour have 54, the Conservatives have 20, and the Liberal Democrats have 1. The Lib Dems' North West seat is in south Cumbria; Labour dominates Greater Manchester, and the Conservatives' vote is concentrated in affluent suburban areas such as Cheadle, Hazel Grove and Altrincham and Sale West. Labour seats also predominate in Merseyside. In Cheshire the 2015 result was reversed, with Labour winning seven seats and the Conservatives four, whilst Lancashire is competitive between Labour and Conservative (8 seats each); the Labour seats in Lancashire are concentrated in the south of the county along the M65. For the region, the Labour gained 3 seats; there was a 5.2% swing from Conservative to Labour.\nIn the 2015 general election, Liverpool Walton was the safest seat in the UK, with a 72% majority, and in 2017 this was repeated with a 77% majority for Dan Carden (Labour), when an astonishing 85.7% of the electorate voted for him (the Conservatives came second with 8.6%). In the by-election of 2012, Manchester Central has the record for the lowest turnout in the UK\u201418%. Gwyneth Dunwoody, for Crewe and Nantwich, was the longest serving female MP until her death in 2008.\nIn the final European Elections in the UK in 2019, 31.23% voted for the Brexit Party, with Labour polling 21.91%, the Liberal Democrats 17.15% and the Green Party 12.48%. The Conservatives came fifth in the region with 7.55% of votes cast.\nLanguage and dialect.\nThe earliest known language spoken in the North West was a dialect of the Brythonic language spoken across much of Britain from at least the Iron Age up to the arrival of English in the first millennium AD. Fragments of this early language are seen in the inscriptions and place names of the Roman era. In some parts of the region, the Brythonic dialect developed into the medieval language known today as Cumbric, which continued to be spoken perhaps as late as the 12th century in the north of Cumbria. This early Celtic heritage remains today in place names such as Carlisle, Penrith and Eccles, and many river names such as Cocker, Kent and Eden.\nEnglish may have been spoken in the North West from around the 7th century AD, when the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria first appears to have made inroads west of the Pennines. The language at this time would have been the Northumbrian dialect of Old English. The region's high number of English place names like Manchester, Liverpool, Lancaster, Blackburn, and Preston suggests English became dominant over time, especially south of the Lake District. From the 9th to 11th centuries, Danes and Norsemen settled in the area, and their influence remains in the placenames and dialect of the North West, the only significant Norse settlement region in England. Elements like \"fell\", \"thwaite\" and \"tarn\", which are particularly common in Cumbria, are all Norse. The numerous Kirkbys and place names with \"holm\" and \"dale\" show the Scandinavian influence throughout the North West.\nThrough the Middle Ages the dialects of the North West would have been considerably different from those spoken in the Midlands and south. It was only with the spread of literacy (particularly with the publication of the King James Bible) that Standard English spread to the region. Even so, local dialects continued to be used and were relatively widespread until the 19th and 20th centuries.\nIn modern times, English is the most spoken language in the North West, with a large percentage of the population fluent in it, and close to 100% conversational in it. To the north-east of the region, within the historic boundaries of Cumberland, the Cumbrian dialect is dominant. The historical county of Lancashire covered a vast amount of land, and the Lancashire dialect and accent is still predominant throughout the county, and stretches as far north as Furness in South Cumbria to parts of north Greater Manchester and Merseyside in the south of the region. The region boasts some of the most distinctive accents in the form of the Scouse accent, which originates from Liverpool and its surrounding areas, and the Manc accent, deriving from the central Manchester district. Both of these descend from the Lancashire dialect but have some distinctions from it, especially Scouse. The region's accents are among those referred to as 'Northern English'.\nLarge immigrant populations in the North West result in the presence of significant immigrant languages. South Asian languages such as Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi are widespread, with the largest number of speakers residing in Preston, Blackburn and Manchester. The Chinese once made up the largest minority in the region (as Liverpool has one of the oldest Chinese settlements in Europe), and still do to the far north where Chinese is spoken by small but significant communities. Since the enlargement of the EU, over one million Poles have immigrated to the UK, a large number of them settling in the North West. Places such as Crewe as well as larger cities make Polish written information available for the public, to much controversy. Other immigrant languages with a presence in the North West are Spanish, mainly amongst the Latin American communities in Liverpool and Manchester, as well as various other Eastern European and Asian languages.\nThe most taught languages in schools across the North West are English, French and Spanish. German and Italian are available at more senior levels and, in cities such as Manchester and Liverpool, even Urdu and Mandarin are being taught to help maintain links between the local minority populations.\nEurostat NUTS.\nIn the Eurostat Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), North West is a level-1 NUTS region, coded \"UKD\", which (since 2015) is subdivided as follows:\nCities and towns.\nPopulation &gt; 400,000\nPopulation &gt; 100,000\nPopulation &gt; 70,000\nPopulation &gt; 50,000\nPopulation &gt; 30,000\nPopulation &gt; 20,000\nPopulation &gt; 10,000\nPopulation &gt; 5,000\nMetropolitan areas.\nThe five largest metropolitan areas in the North West are as follows:\nLiverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered parts of a single large polynuclear metropolitan area, or megalopolis but are usually treated as separate metropolitan areas. In some studies, part of Wigan in Greater Manchester is considered part of the Liverpool metropolitan area.\nPolitics.\nThe North West of England has historically been held by the Labour Party.\nNational politics.\nIn the 2024 United Kingdom general election, the Labour Party won 63 of the North West's 73 constituencies.\nElected regional assembly.\nIt is one of the two regions (along with Yorkshire and the Humber) that were expected to hold a referendum on the establishment of an elected regional assembly. However, when the North East region of England rejected having an elected regional assembly in a referendum, further referendums were cancelled and the proposals for elected regional assemblies in England put on hold. The regional leaders' forum, 4NW is based on Waterside Drive in Wigan.\nEuropean Parliament.\nThe former North West England European Parliament constituency had the same boundaries as the Region.\nHistory.\nTen English regions were established by the government in 1994. At that time, Merseyside, which already had its own Government Office, formerly the Merseyside Task Force, was regarded as a separate region. In 1998, Merseyside was merged into the North West region. This action was controversial in some quarters. Regional Government Offices were abolished in April 2011 by the Coalition Government.\nScientific heritage.\nSir Ernest Marsden (of Blackburn) and Hans Geiger conducted the Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment at the University of Manchester in 1909, where the Geiger counter was invented, which demonstrated the existence of the atomic nucleus. Sir J. J. Thomson of Cheetham Hill discovered the electron (given its name in 1891 by George Johnstone Stoney) in April 1897 and received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1906; his son George Paget Thomson would win the Nobel Prize for Physics 1937 for discovering electron diffraction (at the University of Aberdeen). John Dalton, from Cumbria and moved to Manchester, developed atomic theory. William Sturgeon of Lancashire invented the electromagnet in 1825.\nSydney Chapman, a mathematician from Eccles, in 1930 explained the ozone\u2013oxygen cycle in the stratosphere, being the first to propose that atmospheric oxygen or ozone molecules absorb (harmful UVB and UVC) ultraviolet wavelengths of light in photolysis, to produce reactive single atoms which accumulate to form the ozone layer.\nGraphene was discovered at the University of Manchester in 2004 under Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov.\nAt the Calico Printers' Association in Manchester in 1941, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson discovered polyethylene terephthalate, known as PET, a common polyester compound found in plastic bottles and food, and also known as Terylene or Dacron. Cheslene and Crepes of Macclesfield discovered crimplene, the fabric that is now referred to as polyester. ICI Dyestuffs at Hexagon House, in Blackley in north Manchester, discovered Procion dyes. At the Winnington Laboratory on 27 March 1933, Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson discovered polythene in an ICI laboratory in Northwich, when reacting benzaldehyde with ethene at a pressure of 2,000 atmospheres; the process was improved in 1935 by Michael Perrin.\nHalothane, the world's first synthetic inhalation general anaesthetic gas, was discovered in 1951 at ICI's Widnes Laboratory by Wallasey's Charles Suckling, and first tested on a patient in Manchester in 1956; it works by binding to the GABA receptor. John Charnley of Bury invented the hip replacement in 1962 at Wrightington Hospital, Lancashire, north-west of Wigan. Clatterbridge Hospital in Bebington has a cyclotron (linear accelerator), and is the only hospital in the UK to offer proton therapy.\nAlderley Park opened in October 1957, and ICI Pharmaceuticals was formed in the same year. In 1962 Dora Richardson of ICI discovered tamoxifen. ICI Alderley Park later discovered Anastrozole, Fulvestrant, Goserelin and Bicalutamide, later made by Zeneca. James Black discovered beta blockers\u2014propranolol (Inderal) at Alderley Park in 1962. The Wellcome Foundation, a provider of much of Britain's medical research, was based from 1966 to 1997 at Crewe Hall in Crewe Green.\nClifford Cocks and James H. Ellis from Cheshire, with Malcolm J. Williamson, invented the RSA (algorithm) in 1973 at GCHQ, used for public-key cryptography. Richard Owen from Lancaster coined the word \"dinosaur\" in 1842, and he founded the Natural History Museum, London, opening in 1881.\nIndustrial heritage.\nThe Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway was the world's first passenger inter-city railway in 1830. Manchester Liverpool Road railway station is the world's oldest surviving railway station, having opened on 15 September 1830; the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway had opened in 1825. Chat Moss was a problem to constructing the railway, with Edge Hill Tunnel and Sankey Viaduct; the line was bitterly opposed by William Molyneux, 2nd Earl of Sefton. The Bridgewater Canal was the first recognised canal of the modern era. Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater had visited France and noted their canals. John Gilbert had the innovative idea to use water pumped out of his coal mines to fill a canal from the Duke's Worsley mines to Manchester. It was designed by James Brindley and built in 1761.\nThe Bridgewater Foundry in Patricroft (Salford) can claim to be the world's first factory\nwith an assembly line type arrangement in 1836. Joseph Huddart of Cumbria was the first to mechanise the production of rope in 1793. The spinning jenny was invented in 1764 in Lancashire by James Hargreaves, a mechanical advance on the spinning wheel.\nThe University of Manchester built the world's first programmable computer, the Manchester Baby, on 21 June 1948; the Williams\u2013Kilburn tube on the machine was the world's first computer memory, and the beginning of random-access memory (RAM); the baby computer was made from 550 Mullard valves. The first commercially available computer, the Ferranti Mark 1, was made in Manchester and sold in February 1951 to the University of Manchester. The world's first transistor computer was the Manchester Transistor Computer in November 1953. Atlas was another important computer developed at the University of Manchester, largely developed by Tom Kilburn; at the time in 1962 it was most powerful computer in the world. The government had dropped its financial support of this computer, and was only funded by Ferranti\u2014the total development cost was around \u00a31m. Britain was leading the world at this time in computing, with the only main competitor being IBM; after the mid-1950s America took over the industry. The spreadsheet was invented in 1974, known as the Works Record System, and used an Adabas database on an IBM 3270 at ICI in Northwich; it was developed by Robert Mais and it was around four years before (the more well-known) VisiCalc in 1978. The University of Manchester has collected 25 Nobel prizes, though recent years have been less notable.\nParsonage Colliery at Leigh had the UK's deepest mine\u20141,260 metres in 1949. Macclesfield was the base of UK's silk weaving industry. John Benjamin Dancer of Manchester invented microphotography in 1839, which would lead to microform in the 1920s. Frank Hornby from Liverpool invented Meccano in 1901, where Meccano Ltd would be based for over 60 years. Bryant &amp; May's site in Garston was the last wooden match factory in the UK, closing in 1994 to become The Matchworks business centre off the A561 west of the former Speke airport. Cottonopolis was the industrial name for Manchester and the local area. Manchester at one time was the world's richest city. The CIS Tower, built by John Laing in 1962, was Northern Europe's tallest building, and Britain's tallest building until 1963, and Manchester's tallest building until 2006.\nKirkby was planned in the 1950s as the largest trading estate in Britain\u20141,800 acres. Trafford Park is the world's first planned industrial estate. Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers opened their first co-operative outlet on 21 December 1844.\nAlastair Pilkington invented the float glass method of manufacture in 1957 at St Helens, announcing it in January 1959. It was manufactured from 1961, and 80% of the world's glass is made with the process; the former site closed in 2014 and it is made now at the Green Gate site. Pears soap, made at Port Sunlight, is the world's first registered brand, and world's oldest brand in existence. Elihu Thomson, born in Manchester who subsequently moved to America, formed Thomson-CSF which became Thales Group in 2000. The British part (British Thomson-Houston) would later become part of GEC; he invented the arc lamp. Henry Brunner from Liverpool would join with Ludwig Mond in the 1860s to form a chemical company which became ICI in 1926. Mossbay Steelworks in Workington, when opened in 1877, were the world's first large-scale steelworks; its austenitic manganese steel (mangalloy) was produced from 1877 until 1974, with Britain's railways converting from iron to steel by the 1880s. Track was made there for the UK's railways (exclusively from the 1970s onwards, with the steel made in Teesside) until August 2006; much of the rails made were exported (from 1882), with its main competitor being Voestalpine of Austria, and a plant (bought by British Steel in 1999) in Hayange, France, who make all of SNCF's railway tracks, and the Katowice Steelworks in Poland. Workington was thought to make the best quality rail track in the world.\nSebastian Ziani de Ferranti, born in Liverpool in 1864, was an electrical engineer who designed the layout for Deptford Power Station, the first alternating current power station in the world in 1887, and whose design all others would follow; his later company Ferranti, of Oldham, would later be an industry leader in Britain's defence electronics, on the FTSE 100 Index. Ferranti's design of increasing AC voltage to high tension at the power station, to be stepped-down at a transformer at substations before entering properties, is the system all electricity networks take today; the system reduces wasteful heating of electricity transmission cables.\nThe Chain Home radar transmitters were built by Metrovick at its Trafford Park Works, which became part of AEI in 1929, GEC in 1968, and as Alstom it was closed in June 2000. 2ZY, the first broadcasts in the north of England, were made from the Metrovick factory in November 1922, which became part of the BBC National Programme in 1927. GEC opened its first factory in Manchester in 1888, moving to Salford in 1895 at the Peel Works, and had built the Osram electric light company in 1893. The Metropolitan-Vickers F.2 of Trafford Park Works, Manchester was the first axial-flow jet engine, with a nine-stage compressor, first running in 1941. It would end up as the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire and the American-built Wright J65. The F.2 gas turbine would power MGB.2009 the first gas-turbine-powered vessel in 1947. No. 1 Parachute Training School RAF\u2014the main parachute training site for the war\u2014was at RAF Ringway (the Central Landing Establishment and Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment) now Manchester Airport; many aircraft were built there too, and the Ford Trafford Park Factory built 34,000 aircraft engines\u2014mostly Merlin engines; the nearby Metropolitan-Vickers factory built many Lancasters.\nCalder Hall was the world's first nuclear power station in 1956. There are approximately 430 nuclear power stations around the world, and the UK is the third most experienced operator of nuclear reactors after the US and France, and is the world's ninth largest producer of nuclear-generated electricity, with nine stations operating in the UK producing around 10GW. New-build nuclear power stations will either be the AP1000 (Toshiba Westinghouse NuGeneration) or EPR design (developed by Areva). BNFL bought Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric Company in 1999; it was sold in October 2006 for \u00a35.4 billion to Toshiba. British Energy was sold in 2009 for \u00a312.5 billion to EDF; Centrica (British Gas) had also wanted to buy it; 26 Magnox reactors were built in the UK, followed by 14 AGR reactors.\nOperation Hurricane on 3 October 1952, Britain's first nuclear bomb, detonated on HMS \"Plym\" on the Montebello Islands in the state of Western Australia, was made of plutonium-239 mostly made at Windscale (which began production in 1950), with some possibly from Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, Canada (where the Tube Alloys project was later moved).\nW. T. Glover &amp; Co. of Salford were important electricity cable manufacturers throughout the early 20th century. BAE Systems Wind Tunnel Department at Warton\u2014one of its four wind tunnels\u2014the High Speed Wind Tunnel\u2014can test speeds intermittently up to Mach 3.8 (trisonic)\u2014the second fastest in the UK, to the University of Manchester's Aero-Physics Laboratory which has a hypersonic wind tunnel up to Mach 6. Osborne Reynolds of Owens College (which became the Victoria University of Manchester in 1904), known worldwide for his Reynolds number (introduced elsewhere by the mathematician George Gabriel Stokes), showed in the early 1880s that wind tunnels (invented by Francis Herbert Wenham in 1871) could model large-scale objects accurately. BAE Systems Regional Aircraft assembled Britain's last airliner, the British Aerospace 146 (Avro RJX), at Woodford in November 2001. The Merlin-powered Avro Tudor G-AGPF, which took off from what is now Manchester Airport on 14 June 1945, was Britain's first pressurised civilian aircraft; only 38 were built and it was designed for the North Atlantic route. On 13 May 1949, \"VN799\" the English Electric Canberra first flew from Warton: Warton at the time was a former USAAF wartime maintenance base; the German Arado Ar 234 was technically the world's first jet bomber; the Canberra would be the first jet aircraft to make a non-stop crossing of the Atlantic on 21 February 1951.\nRobert Whitehead of Bolton invented the modern-day torpedo in 1866. Sir William Pickles Hartley of Lancashire founded Hartley's Jam in 1871, building a purpose-built village at Aintree. Sir Henry Tate also came from Lancashire, joining Abram Lyle in 1921, of whose Golden syrup tins are claimed to be Britain's oldest brand; he established the Tate Gallery in 1897. Robert Hope-Jones of the Wirral invented the Wurlitzer organ. The Christys' &amp; Co factory in Stockport was the largest hat-making factory in the world in the nineteenth century; it became part of Associated British Hat Manufacturers and is now in Oxfordshire. The company owner's son founded Christy in 1850 in Droylsden (now in Tameside), which invented the industrially produced towel.\nBritain's most popular car, the Ford Escort, was made throughout its life (until 21 July 2000) at Halewood by Ford; 5\u00a0million were made there from 1967. In 1998, production of its replacement the Focus was transferred to Saarlouis and Valencia, which signalled the end of the site's ownership by Ford. The Jaguar X-Type was first made there in May 2001, until late 2009. In the UK, the Mondeo has sold 1.4m since 1993, and is made in Valencia in Spain.\nStarchaser Industries of Hyde is hoping to send a British citizen into space, on a British rocket; BAC at Preston had proposed its MUSTARD re-usable spacecraft in 1964, which although not built had given NASA a concept.\nCulture.\nThe Suffragette movement came from Manchester\u2014the Women's Social and Political Union.

The first Trades Union Congress was held in 1868 at the Mechanics' Institute, Manchester. The World Pie Eating Championship is held in Wigan each year.\nAnn Lee from Manchester started the USA Shakers movement, founded out of the Quakers, which itself has strong links to Pendle Hill in Lancashire. Joseph Livesey of Preston was the founder of Britain's temperance movement, and the word \"teetotal\" was first coined in Preston in 1833. The crumbly Cheshire cheese is thought to be the oldest in Britain. Heaton Park in north Manchester is the largest municipal park in Europe. Jelly Babies were invented in Lancaster in 1864, at Fryers of Lancashire. The first KFC outlet in the UK was on Fishergate in Preston in May 1965, opened by the entrepreneur Ray Allen. Oldham claims to be the site of the first fried potatoes in the UK in 1860. The UK's biggest dance music festival takes place on the August Bank Holiday at Creamfields on Daresbury Estate. Ingvar Kamprad's IKEA opened its first UK store in Warrington on 1 October 1987; the UK was the 20th country at the time that IKEA had been established. The International Cheese Awards are held at the end of July in Nantwich.\nLiverpool and Manchester, the two largest cities in the North West by population, are known for being the birthplace of beat music (also called \"Merseybeat\") during the 1960s to 1970s, and the development of the Madchester music scene from the 1980s, and 1990s respectively.\n\"A Taste of Honey\" was an influential 1960s film set in Salford, depicting working class poverty in ways not previously seen at the cinema, known as kitchen sink realism; Walter Greenwood's \"Love on the Dole\", a 1930s book also set in Salford, was thought by the BBFC to be too sordid a depiction of poverty to be made into a film; Mike Leigh, from Salford, has produced films on a similar subject.\nTransport.\nTransport policy.\nAs part of the national transport planning system,\nthe North West Regional Assembly was, before its abolition in 2008, required to produce a Regional Transport Strategy (RTS) to provide long term planning for transport in the region. This involved region wide transport schemes, such as those carried out by the Highways Agency and Network Rail. Within the region, the local transport authorities plan for the future by producing Local Transport Plans (LTPs) which outline their strategies, policies and implementation programmes. The most recent LTP is that for the period 2006\u201311. In the North West region, the following transport authorities have published their LTP online: Blackburn with Darwen U.A, Blackpool U.A., Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Halton U.A., Lancashire, Merseyside and Warrington U.A. Since 1 April 2009, when the county of Cheshire was split into two unitary councils the Cheshire transport authority ceased to exist, however it is the most recent LTP for the area.\nRoad.\nRegionwide.\nRegionwide, the principal road link is the M6, which enters the region, from Scotland, near Carlisle in the north and leaves it, for the English Midlands, near Crewe in the south. It connects such towns and cities as Penrith, Kendal, Lancaster, Preston, Warrington, Liverpool and Manchester. The M6 intersects many of the North West's motorways and A-roads, carrying almost 120,000 vehicles per day (41,975,000 per year).\nBritain's most severe steep road is Hardknott Pass in Cumbria and the highest road in the UK is the former A6293 at 2,780\u00a0ft at Milburn, Cumbria; the highest classified road in England was the A689 east of Nenthead in Cumbria on the Durham boundary.\nGreater Manchester and Merseyside.\nThe Greater Manchester and Merseyside areas are home to almost 4\u00a0million people; over half of the region's population. The road networks intertwining these metropolitan areas are extremely important to the economy and are largely motorway, including the M62 which crosses the entire country (east to west, Hull to Liverpool); this motorway directly connects the cities of Manchester and Liverpool, carrying 78,000 vehicles in the North West per day.\nThe Merseyside-Manchester region has many other motorways that serve many millions on a daily basis: the M61 connects Manchester to Preston; the M56 runs south of Manchester to Cheshire and Wales; the M57 and M58 motorways run north of Liverpool and connect towns such as St. Helens and Wigan; the M60 is Manchester's ring road; and the M67 and M66 motorways run east and north respectively, both of these roads are under and link Manchester to smaller outlying settlements. On top of this there are countless numbers of A-roads, B-roads and minor roads which circle, entwine and serve these two major metropolises.\nCumbria.\nIn Cumbria the M6 runs all the way down the east of the county connecting the very north of England to the Lancashire border. The A590 links Barrow-in-Furness to Kendal with around 14,000 vehicles per day. The A595 runs all the way along the West Cumbrian coast beginning near Barrow and ending in Carlisle, linking towns such as Whitehaven and Workington. The A591 road runs from Kendal to the centre of the county connecting Lake District settlements like Windermere, Ambleside and Keswick. Other important A-roads include the A5092, A66, A596 and formerly the A74, until this was upgraded to motorway standard as an extension of the M6 between 2006 and 2008 to meet the A74(M) at the Scottish border.\nLancashire.\nThe Lancashire economy relies strongly on the M6, which also runs from north to south (Lancaster to Chorley). Other motorways in the region include the M55, which connects the city of Preston and the town of Blackpool at in length. The M65 motorway runs from east to west, starting in the town of Colne, running past Burnley, Accrington, Blackburn and terminating in Preston. The Lancaster-Morecambe area is served by the A683, A6, A588 and A589 roads. The Blackpool-Fylde-Fleetwood area is home to the A583, A584, A585, A586, A587 and A588 roads. The city of Preston and its surroundings are served by the A6, A59, A582, A583, A584 and, to the very south-east, the M61 motorway. To the east of the county are the A59, A6119, A677, A679, A666, A680, A56, A646 and A682.

To the west of the M6, Crewe, Northwich and Sandbach are served by the A54, A51, A49, A533, A556 and A530 roads; these all eventually link up connecting the towns to the larger cities, including Stoke-on-Trent to the south. To the east of the M6 in Cheshire lies the Peak District and towns such as Macclesfield and Congleton, which are served by the A6, A537, A536, A34, A523 and A566 roads.\nAir.\nThe biggest international airport in the region is Manchester Airport, which serves 28.2\u00a0million passengers annually; more than some of the world's major aviation hubs. The airport is home to three terminals, plus the World Freight Terminal, which serve destinations worldwide. The largest airlines at the airport (in terms of numbers of flights in 2007) were Flybe, BMI, British Airways, Jet2.com and Lufthansa; several long-haul carriers such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Virgin Atlantic, Singapore Airlines and Emirates also operate from the airport. Manchester Airports Group is owned approximately one-third by Manchester Council and one-third by the other nine Greater Manchester councils. In 2007, Manchester had a recorded 222,703 aircraft movements. The airport is also a hub for major holiday airlines such as First Choice Airways and Thomson Airways; it was previously served by Thomas Cook Airlines and Monarch Airlines.\nThe region's second largest airport, but is the oldest and fastest growing, is Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which serves over 5\u00a0million passengers annually. The airport serves destinations primarily in the UK and Europe and is a major hub for EasyJet and Ryanair.\nThe only other significant passenger airport in the region was Blackpool Airport, which was refurbished in 2006 and handled around half a million passengers annually. Destinations ranged from the Canary Islands in Spain to the Republic of Ireland. Commercial flights ended there in March 2017.\nRail.\nThe main connection by train is the West Coast Main Line, connecting most of the North West. Other important lines are the Liverpool to Manchester Lines and the North TransPennine, which connects Liverpool to Manchester through Warrington. East-west connections in Lancashire are carried via the Caldervale Line to Blackpool. Liverpool and Manchester both have extensive local passenger rail networks operating high-frequency commuter trains. The quietest railway station in the region, by usage, is Reddish South, the 4th quietest in Britain.\nThe InterCity branded service in the UK began between London and Manchester in the mid-1960s; the new Euston station opened in 1968. With the new electrification of the line in the late 1960s, passenger numbers doubled.\nThe region saw the last steam-train service on the UK network \u2013 the Fifteen Guinea Special on 11 August 1968, with\nthree Black Five locomotives.\nWater.\nSea ferries depart from the following ports: Port of Liverpool (Gladstone Dock), Bootle to Dublin (P&amp;O Ferries) and Douglas on the Isle of Man (Isle of Man Steam Packet Company); Birkenhead (Twelve Quays Terminal) to Belfast and Dublin (Norfolkline Irish Sea Ferries \u2013 former Norse Merchant Ferries); Fleetwood to Larne (Stena Line) in Northern Ireland; and Heysham Port to Douglas (Isle of Man Steam Packet).\nThe world's first hovercraft service took place on 20 July 1962, from Leasowe (Moreton) to Rhyl, operated by British United Airways in a Vickers-Armstrongs VA-3, powered by two turboprop engines.\nLeeds and Liverpool Canal has run into Liverpool city centre, via Liverpool Canal Link at Pier Head, since 2009.\nLiverpool Cruise Terminal in the city centre provides long-distance passenger cruises; Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, MS Black Watch and Cruise &amp; Maritime Voyages MS Magellan all use the terminal to depart to Iceland, France, Spain and Norway.\nEconomy.\nThe North West is historically linked with the textiles industry, mainly before the mid 20th century. The Greater Manchester region produces the most economic output according to GVA in 2014 with \u00a357,395m, followed by Merseyside \u00a328,257m, Lancashire with \u00a327,668m, Cheshire \u00a325,803m and Cumbria with \u00a310,747m.\nAccording to research by Cushman &amp; Wakefield in 2008, Manchester is the second best city to locate a business in the UK whilst Liverpool is the eleventh best city. The \"Financial Times\" stated that the North West economy, led by the redevelopment of Manchester and Liverpool, is a genuine rival to \"overheated London\".\nThe area's electricity, formerly looked after by MANWEB and NORWEB, is now looked after by ScottishPower Energy Networks and United Utilities respectively.

GSK Ulverston, built in 1949 as Glaxo to produce penicillin with a new plant to be built, makes cephalosporin antibiotics including cefuroxime and ceftazidime.\nEducation.\nSecondary education.\nSecondary schools are mostly comprehensive, but Trafford retains a wholly selective school system, and there are some other grammar schools in Lancashire, Wirral, Liverpool and Cumbria.\nThere are around 345,000 at secondary school in the region, the third highest in England, after South East England and Greater London. This is around three times as much as there are in North East England. For school truancy the most persistent truants are in Manchester with a rate of 7.3%, followed by Knowsley with 6.9%, and Blackpool with 6.6%. The lowest truancy rate is in South Ribble with 2.4% followed by Ribble Valley with 2.9% (both in Lancashire).\nAt A level in 2010, Trafford performed the best and, again like its results at GCSE, is one of the best areas in England. The lowest performing area is, again, Knowsley but followed by Rochdale. Knowsley has had some dreadful results at A-level; Halewood Academy, its last school sixth-form, closed in 2016; there is now no school-based A-level provision in Knowsley, it is provided by the Knowsley Community College. For traditional counties, Lancashire gets excellent results at A-level, being one of the best in England. Areas also performing above the England average, in order of results, are Blackpool, Warrington, Wigan, Cheshire West and Chester, Bury, Cumbria, Wirral, and Stockport. Blackpool performs not particularly well at GCSE, yet produces much better results at A level\u2014even better than Cheshire West and Chester, and the third-best in the region.\nThe areas that have school children most likely to attend university are Trafford and Cheshire, followed by Wirral, Sefton, Stockport and Bury. Four of these areas are or were part of Cheshire.\nColleges.\nThe two main higher education colleges in the region are Blackburn College and Blackpool and The Fylde College. There are forty three FE colleges. The regional LSC was in central Manchester; this is now the SFA and the YPLA.\nUniversities.\nThe universities in the North West are listed below:\nOver 60% of university students in the region are native to the region. The region with the next-highest number of students in the North-West is Yorkshire and the Humber, so approximately 80% of university students in the area are from the north of England. The region's students have the highest proportion of students from so-called low-participation neighbourhoods.\nLocal media.\n The BBC's former North West England headquarters on Oxford Road\nThe UK's Time signal comes from Anthorn Radio Station on the north-west Cumbrian coast, where there are three atomic clocks.\nGuardian Media Group have a printing site at Trafford Park Printers off the A5081 (M60 junction 9) between the Bridgewater Canal and the A576 roundabout which prints the \"Guardian\" (it is owned 50% with the Telegraph and 50% by Guardian Print Centre); it printed the \"Telegraph\" until 2008, and is known also as GPC Manchester. From 2008, the \"Telegraph\" has been printed at the Newsprinters huge site at Knowsley. Newsprinters have a site near Dairy Crest at Knowsley, and prints the \"Times\", \"Telegraph\" and \"Sun\" titles, near the B5202.\nBroughton Printers, owned by Northern &amp; Shell, print the \"Express\" and \"Star\" at Fulwood on the B6241 south of the M55/M6 junction, on the same site as the \"Lancashire Evening Post\".\nPrinovis in Liverpool (Speke) prints \"OK!\", the \"Sun on Sunday\" magazine (\"Fabulous\"), and the \"Sunday Times\" magazine.\nSport.\nThe modern dart board was invented in 1896 by Lancashire carpenter Brian Gamlin from Bury, aged 44. Oulton Park, in central Cheshire, is the home of the British Touring Car Championship in June. The International Netball Federation is situated in Manchester, home to the National Squash Centre and the National Cycling Centre (Manchester Velodrome and British Cycling) at Sportcity. The first greyhound racing in the UK was in July 1926 in Manchester at the purpose-built oval Belle Vue Stadium. The National Football Museum is in Manchester.\nFootball.\nThe following football clubs are based in the North West, and compete in the Premier League or Football League (the top four division of the English football league system) into the 2025-26 season. The National League is also included.\nTeams in the North West have won 64 out of 124 English football League titles (just over 50%), more than any other region, with Manchester United and Liverpool having won more than any other teams.\nRugby League.\nThe following rugby league clubs are based in the North West, and compete in the Super League or the Championships (the top three division of the British rugby league system) as of 2021.\nHorse Racing.\nAintree Racecourse in Liverpool is home of the Grand National.\nSwimming.\nBritish Swimming have one of its three Intensive Training Centres at the Grand Central Pools in Stockport.\nGolf.\nRoyal Birkdale Golf Club is at Southport and there is the Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club. Royal Liverpool Golf Club is at Hoylake.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On the eve of the 1994 general election, South Africa's former homelands, known as Bantustans, were reintegrated into the country, and the four provinces were increased to nine. The borders of Natal and the Orange Free State were retained, while the Cape Province and Transvaal were divided into three provinces each, plus North West Province which straddles the border of and contains territory from both these two former provinces. The twelfth, thirteenth and sixteenth amendments to the Constitution of South Africa changed the borders of seven of the provinces.\nHistory.\nThe Union of South Africa was established in 1910 by combining four British colonies: Cape Colony; Natal Colony; Transvaal Colony; Orange River Colony. The last two were, before the Second Boer War, independent republics known as the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. These colonies became the four original provinces of the Union: Cape Province; Transvaal Province; Natal Province; Orange Free State Province.\nSegregation of the black population started as early as 1913, with ownership of land by the black majority being restricted to certain areas totalling about 13% of the country. From the late 1950s, these areas were gradually consolidated into \"homelands\", also called \"bantustans\". Four of these homelands were established as quasi-independent nation states of the black population during the apartheid era. In 1976, the homeland of Transkei was the first to accept independence from South Africa, and although this independence was never acknowledged by any other country, three other homelands\u00a0\u2013 Bophuthatswana (1977), Venda (1979) and Ciskei (1981)\u00a0\u2013 followed suit.\nOn 27 April 1994, the date of the first non-racial elections and of the adoption of the Interim Constitution, all of these provinces and homelands were dissolved, and nine new provinces were established. The boundaries of these provinces were established in 1993 by a \"Commission on the Demarcation/Delimitation of Regions\" created by CODESA, and were broadly based on \"planning regions\" demarcated by the Development Bank of Southern Africa in the 1980s, and amalgamated from existing magisterial districts, with some concessions to political parties that wished to consolidate their power bases, by transferring districts between the proposed provinces. The definitions of the new provinces in terms of magisterial districts were found in Schedule 1 of the Interim Constitution.\nOn 11 July 2003, the 11th amendment to the fifth constitution renamed the Northern Province to Limpopo. On 1 March 2006, the 12th and 13th amendments altered the boundaries of 7 provinces. On 3 April 2009 the 16th amendment altered the boundaries of the North West and Gauteng provinces.\nGovernment.\nSouth Africa's provinces are governed, in different ways, on a national, provincial and local level.\nNationally, there is the National Council of Provinces, one of the houses of Parliament. Then there is the provincial government and, below that, the administration of district and metropolitan municipalities.\nNational Council of Provinces.\nSouth Africa has two houses of parliament: the National Assembly, and the National Council of Provinces. The second exists to ensure that the interests of each province are protected in the laws passed by the National Assembly.\nEach one of South Africa's nine provinces sends 10 representatives to the National Council of Provinces. Six of these are permanent members of the council, and four are special delegates.\nProvincial government.\nEach province is governed by a unicameral legislature. The size of the legislature is proportional to population, ranging from 30 members in the Northern Cape to 80 in KwaZulu-Natal. The legislatures are elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation; by convention, they are all elected on the same day, at the same time as the National Assembly election.\nThe provincial legislature elects, from amongst its members, a Premier, who is the head of the executive. The Premier chooses an Executive Council consisting of between five and ten members of the legislature, which is the cabinet of the provincial government. The Members of the Executive Council (MECs) are the provincial equivalent of ministers.\nThe powers of the provincial government are limited to specific topics listed in the national constitution. On some of these topics\u00a0\u2013 for example, agriculture, education, health and public housing\u00a0\u2013 the province's powers are shared with the national government, which can establish uniform standards and frameworks for the provincial governments to follow; on other topics the provincial government has exclusive power.\nThe provinces do not have their own court systems, as the administration of justice is the responsibility of the national government.\nList.\nFootnotes:\nProvincial acronyms.\n xbh 955 gp\nFormer administrative divisions.\nFootnotes:\n\u2020 States for which the homeland was quasi-independent.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, electrons may be replaced by other negatively charged particles such as muons (muonic atoms) or pions (pionic atoms). Because these substitute particles are usually unstable, exotic atoms typically have very short lifetimes and no exotic atom observed so far can persist under normal conditions.\nMuonic atoms.\nIn a \"muonic atom\" (previously called a \"mu-mesic\" atom, now known to be a misnomer as muons are not mesons), an electron is replaced by a muon, which, like the electron, is a lepton. Since leptons are only sensitive to weak, electromagnetic and gravitational forces, muonic atoms are governed to very high precision by the electromagnetic interaction.\nSince a muon is more massive than an electron, the Bohr orbits are closer to the nucleus in a muonic atom than in an ordinary atom, and corrections due to quantum electrodynamics are more important. Study of muonic atoms' energy levels as well as transition rates from excited states to the ground state therefore provide experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics.\nOther muonic atoms can be formed when negative muons interact with ordinary matter. The muon in muonic atoms can either decay or get captured by a proton. Muon capture is very important in heavier muonic atoms, but shortens the muon's lifetime from 2.2\u00a0\u03bcs to only 0.08\u00a0\u03bcs.\nMuonic hydrogen.\nMuonic hydrogen is like normal hydrogen with the electron replaced by a negative muon, which is to say, a proton orbited by a muon. It is important in addressing the proton radius puzzle.\nMuonic hydrogen atoms can form muonic hydrogen molecules. The spacing between the nuclei in such a molecule is hundreds of times smaller than in a normal hydrogen molecule \u2013so close that the nuclei can spontaneously fuse together. This is known as \"muon-catalyzed fusion\", and was first observed between hydrogen-1 and deuterium nuclei in 1957. Muon-catalyzed fusion has been proposed as a means of generating energy using fusion reactions in a room-temperature reactor.\nMuonic helium (Hydrogen-4.1).\nThe symbol 4.1H (Hydrogen-4.1) has been used to describe the exotic atom muonic helium (4He-\u03bc), which is like helium-4 in having two protons and two neutrons. However one of its electrons is replaced by a muon, which also has charge \u20131. Because the muon's orbital radius is less than the electron's orbital radius (due to the mass ratio), the muon can be considered as a part of the nucleus. The atom then has a nucleus with two protons, two neutrons and one muon, with total nuclear charge +1 (from two protons and one muon) and only one electron outside, so that it is effectively an isotope of hydrogen instead of an isotope of helium. A muon's weight is approximately so the isotopic mass is 4.1. Since there is only one electron outside the nucleus, the hydrogen-4.1 atom can react with other atoms. Its chemical behavior is more like a hydrogen atom than an inert helium atom.\nHadronic atoms.\nA \"hadronic atom\" is an atom in which one or more of the orbital electrons are replaced by a negatively charged hadron. Possible hadrons include mesons such as the pion or kaon, yielding a \"pionic atom\" or a \"kaonic atom\" (see Kaonic hydrogen), collectively called \"mesonic atoms\"; antiprotons, yielding an \"antiprotonic atom\"; and the particle, yielding a or \"sigmaonic atom\".\nUnlike leptons, hadrons can interact via the strong force, so the orbitals of hadronic atoms are influenced by nuclear forces between the nucleus and the hadron. Since the strong force is a short-range interaction, these effects are strongest if the atomic orbital involved is close to the nucleus, when the energy levels involved may broaden or disappear because of the absorption of the hadron by the nucleus. Hadronic atoms, such as pionic hydrogen and kaonic hydrogen, thus provide experimental probes of the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics.\nOnium.\nAn \"onium\" (plural: \"onia\") is the bound state of a particle and its antiparticle. The classic onium is positronium, which consists of an electron and a positron bound together as a metastable state, with a relatively long lifetime of 142 ns in the triplet state. Positronium has been studied since the 1950s to understand bound states in quantum field theory. A recent development called non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (NRQED) used this system as a proving ground.\nPionium, a bound state of two oppositely charged pions, is useful for exploring the strong interaction. This should also be true of protonium, which is a proton\u2013antiproton bound state. Understanding bound states of pionium and protonium is important in order to clarify notions related to exotic hadrons such as mesonic molecules and pentaquark states. Kaonium, which is a bound state of two oppositely charged kaons, has not been observed experimentally yet.\nThe true analogs of positronium in the theory of strong interactions, however, are not exotic atoms but certain mesons, the \"quarkonium states\", which are made of a heavy quark such as the charm or bottom quark and its antiquark. (Top quarks are so heavy that they decay through the weak force before they can form bound states.) Exploration of these states through non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) and lattice QCD are increasingly important tests of quantum chromodynamics.\nMuonium, despite its name, is \"not\" an onium state containing a muon and an antimuon, because IUPAC assigned that name to the system of an antimuon bound with an electron. However, the production of a muon\u2013antimuon bound state, which \"is\" an onium (called true muonium), has been theorized. The same applies to the ditauonium (or \"true tauonium\") exotic QED atom.\nHypernuclear atoms.\nAtoms may be composed of electrons orbiting a hypernucleus that includes strange particles called hyperons. Such hypernuclear atoms are generally studied for their nuclear behaviour, falling into the realm of nuclear physics rather than atomic physics.\nQuasiparticle atoms.\nIn condensed matter systems, specifically in some semiconductors, there are states called excitons, which are bound states of an electron and an electron hole.\nExotic molecules.\nAn exotic molecule contains one or more exotic atoms.\n\"Exotic molecule\" can also refer to a molecule having some other uncommon property such as pyramidal hexamethylbenzene and a Rydberg atom.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "53219", "revid": "16893326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53219", "title": "Sword and sorcery", "text": "Genre of fantasy fiction\nSword and sorcery (S&amp;S), or heroic fantasy, is a genre of literature characterized by sword-wielding heroes engaged in exciting and violent adventures. Elements of romance, magic, and the supernatural are also often present. Unlike works of high fantasy, the tales, though dramatic, focus on personal battles rather than world-endangering matters. The genre originated from the early 1930s works of Robert E. Howard. In parallel with \"sword and sorcery\", the term \"heroic fantasy\" is used, although it is a more loosely defined genre.\nSword and sorcery tales eschew overarching themes of \"good vs evil\" in favor of situational conflicts that often pit morally gray characters against one another to enrich themselves, or to defy tyranny.\nSword and sorcery is grounded in real-world social and societal hierarchies, and is grittier, darker, and more violent, with elements of cosmic or Lovecraftian creatures that aren't a staple of mainstream fantasy. The main character is often a barbarian with antihero traits.\nEtymology.\nThe Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction records an example of \"sword and sorcery\" from 1953, where it appears in a headline of a review of an L. Sprague de Camp novel. In the 6 April 1961 issue of the fantasy fanzine \"Ancalagon\", American author Fritz Leiber re-coined the term in response to a letter from British author Michael Moorcock in the fanzine \"Amra\", demanding a name for the sort of fantasy-adventure story written by Robert E. Howard. Moorcock had initially proposed the term \"epic fantasy\". Leiber replied in the journal \"Ancalagon\" (6 April 1961), suggesting \"sword-and-sorcery as a good popular catchphrase for the field\". He expanded on this in the July 1961 issue of \"Amra\", commenting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I feel more certain than ever that this field should be called the sword-and-sorcery story. This accurately describes the points of culture-level and supernatural element and also immediately distinguishes it from the cloak-and-sword (historical adventure) story\u2014and (quite incidentally) from the cloak-and-dagger (international espionage) story too!\nThe term \"heroic fantasy\" has been used to avoid the garish overtones of \"sword and sorcery\". This name was coined by L. Sprague de Camp. However, it has also been used to describe a broader range of fantasy, including High fantasy.\nStyle and themes.\nHeavily influenced by the adventure genre, the settings of sword and sorcery often revolve around Alternate history, pulling influences from early 20th century Archaeology and Theosophy. The setting can be an Earth in the mythical past or distant future, an imaginary other world or an alien planet. Sword and sorcery stories are also influenced by Horror, Mythology, Folklore, and Science Fiction. The technological level of most sword and sorcery settings is similar to that of the ancient or medieval periods with an emphasis on swordplay.\nThe Protagonist is usually an antihero who fights against supernatural evil and the occult. Unlike fantasy, the magic of a sword and sorcery story comes at a substantial cost, or what can be described as a hard magic system. Although the main character mostly behaves heroically, he may ally with an enemy or sacrifice an ally in order to survive. A hero's main weapons are cunning and physical strength. Magic, on the other hand, is usually only used by the villains of the story, who are usually wizards, witches, or supernatural monsters. A recurring theme in the genre is a damsel in distress. Although Robert E. Howard was known for writing strong female protagonists such as Agnes and Valeria, the 1960s onward saw an emphasis on male protagonists and underdeveloped female characters by the popular authors of the time. This issue has declined in recent years.\nIn his introduction to the 1967 Ace edition of \"Conan the Barbarian\", L. Sprague de Camp described the typical sword and sorcery story as:\n[A] story of action and adventure laid in a more or less imaginary world, where magic works and where modern science and technology have not yet been discovered. The setting may (as in the Conan stories) be this Earth as it is conceived to have been long ago, or as it will be in the remote future, or it may be another planet or another dimension.\nSuch a story combines the color and dash of the historical costume romance with the atavistic supernatural thrills of the weird, occult, or ghost story. When well done, it provides the purest \"fun\" of fiction of any kind. It is escape fiction wherein one escapes clear out of the real world into one where all men are strong, all women beautiful, all life adventurous, and all problems simple, and nobody even mentions the income tax or the dropout problem or socialized medicine.\nSprague DeCamp has since received considerable backlash from the modern sword and sorcery community for fueling misconceptions about the purpose and style of the genre. Organizations such as the Robert E. Howard Foundation and various fanzines have worked elevate the embedded themes of social criticism and indicate the academic importance of the genre's relevance to the development of existentialist literature.\nMany sword and sorcery tales have turned into lengthy series of adventures. Their lower stakes and less-than world-threatening dangers make this more plausible than a repetition of the perils of high fantasy. So too does the nature of the heroes; most sword and sorcery protagonists, travelers by nature, find peace after adventure deathly dull.\nSword and sorcery experiences crossover with dark fantasy. The scale of the struggles depicted is smaller, and the main character usually pursues personal gain, such as wealth or love. The opposition between good and evil characteristic of fantasy also exists in Sword and Sorcery literature, but it is less absolute and the events often take place in a morally gray area. These features are especially emphasized in newer works of the genre. The stories are fast-paced and action-oriented, with lots of violent fight scenes. Like most speculative fiction, Sword and Sorcery has been criticized for its over employment of the Deus ex machina trope.\nWriters such as Howard, Michael Moorcock and Samuel R. Delany have used the Sword and Sorcery genre to address serious themes such as Assisted suicide, anti-fascism, liberty, anti-slavery, sex trafficking, criticism of organized religion, and the cyclical rise and fall of civilization. Sword and sorcery is most well known for its discussion of agency and employment of ideas related to conflict theory. While sword and sorcery employs a wide variety of narrative conflicts, the most typical structure is Man Vs Man, presented in the context of Man Vs Society or Man Vs God, wherein the villain of the story is a symbolic representation of a greater evil.\nA quote from \"The Alexandrian\" summarizes a core theme found within sword and sorcery:\n\"The mythic root of these stories is Robin Hood, whose idyllic society of Merry Men living in the barbarism of Sherwood Forest achieves the ideals of chivalry and nobility which are falsely claimed by the corrupt powers of \u201ccivilization.\u201d ...Where civilization fails to protect the innocent (and is, in fact, often the ones victimizing them), it is the \u201coutsider\u201d that civilization teaches you to fear that will ultimately sacrifice to help those in need.\"\nIt is typical for the topics that sword and sorcery deals with to be divisive. Certain authors, particularly from 1960 to the late 1980s, have been criticized for excessive violence, misogyny, racism and fascism.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn his introduction to the reference \"Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers\" by L. Sprague de Camp, Lin Carter notes that the heritage of sword and sorcery is illustrious, and can be traced back to mythology, including the labors of Hercules, as well as to classical epics such as Homer's \"Odyssey\", the Norse sagas, and Arthurian legend.\nIt also has been influenced by historical fiction. For instance, the work of Sir Walter Scott was influenced by Scottish folklore and ballads. Yet few of Scott's stories contain fantastic elements; in most, the appearance of such is explained away. Its themes of adventure in a strange society were influenced by adventures set in foreign lands by Sir H. Rider Haggard and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Haggard's works, such as \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1885) and \"\" (1887) included many fantastic elements. Some of Haggard's characters, such as Umslopogaas, an axe-wielding Zulu warrior who encountered supernatural phenomena and loved to fight, bore similarities to sword and sorcery heroes. Haggard also wrote \"Eric Brighteyes\" (1891), a violent historical novel based on the Icelandic Sagas; some writers, (such as David Pringle) have stated that \"Eric Brighteyes\" resembles a modern sword and sorcery novel. Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels featured physical formidable male heroes such as Tarzan and John Carter of Mars. Burroughs' heroes had adventures involving the exploration of strange regions and battles with fearsome creatures. Burroughs' work was enormously influential on the initial generation of American sword and sorcery writers, such as Robert E. Howard.\nSword and sorcery's immediate progenitors are the swashbuckling tales of Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re (\"The Three Musketeers\" (1844), etc.), Rafael Sabatini (\"Scaramouche\" (1921), etc.) and their pulp magazine imitators, such as Talbot Mundy, Harold Lamb, and H. Bedford-Jones, who all influenced Howard. Mundy in particular, proved influential: early sword and sorcery writers such as Howard, C. L. Moore and Fritz Leiber were admirers of Mundy's fiction. However, these historical \"swashbucklers\" lack the supernatural element which defines the genre.\nAnother influence was early fantasy fiction. This type of fiction includes the short stories of Lord Dunsany's such as \"The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth\" (1910) and \"The Distressing Tale of Thangobrind the Jeweller\" (1911). These works of Dunsany's feature warriors who clash with monsters and wizards in realms of Dunsany's creation. Dunsany's work proved inspirational to C.L. Moore, Fritz Leiber, Jack Vance, and Karl Edward Wagner. \"The Worm Ouroboros\" (1922) by E. R. Eddison, a heroic romance written in a mock-archaic style, was an inspiration to later writers of sword and sorcery such as Leiber. The \"Poictesme\" novels of James Branch Cabell, such as \"\" (1919), have been cited as a stimulus to early sword and sorcery writing. Cabell's novels depict picaresque exploits in imaginary lands, and were an influence on Leiber and Vance. A. Merritt's novels \"The Ship of Ishtar\" (1924) and \"Dwellers in the Mirage\" (1932) have also been cited as influences on sword and sorcery, as they feature men from the then-contemporary world being drawn into dangerous adventures involving swordplay and magic. All these authors influenced sword and sorcery for the plots, characters, and landscapes used.\nAlso, many early sword and sorcery writers, such as Howard and Clark Ashton Smith, were influenced by the Middle Eastern tales of the Arabian Nights, whose stories of magical monsters and evil sorcerers were an influence on the genre-to-be.\nSword and sorcery's frequent depictions of smoky taverns and fetid back alleys draw upon the picaresque genre; for example, Rachel Bingham notes that Fritz Leiber's city of Lankhmar bears considerable similarity to 16th century Seville as depicted in Miguel de Cervantes' tale \"Rinconete y Cortadillo\".\nSword and sorcery proper only truly began in the pulp fantasy magazines, where it emerged from \"weird fiction\". The magazine \"Weird Tales\", which published Howard's Conan stories and C. L. Moore's Jirel of Joiry tales, as well as key influences like H. P. Lovecraft and Smith, was especially important. Lovecraft's fiction (especially his \"Dream Cycle\" of Dunsany-inspired fantasy stories) was a source of inspiration for the first generation of sword and sorcery writers.\nThe 1929 \"Weird Tales\" story \"The Shadow Kingdom\" by Robert E. Howard is often regarded as the first true \"sword and sorcery\" tale, because it pits a heroic warrior (Kull of Atlantis) against supernatural evil, in an imaginary world of the writer's devising.\nScience fiction author Isaac Asimov once stated in his own \"Science Fiction Magazine\" that \"The contemporary Sword-and-Sorcery tale owes its existence to the imagination of Robert Howard and his invention of the Conan stories.\"\nHoward published only three stories featuring Kull in \"Weird Tales\". He revised an unsold Kull story, \"By This Axe I Rule!\" into \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", which introduced a new character, Conan the Barbarian. When \"The Phoenix on the Sword\" was published in 1932, it proved popular with the \"Weird Tales\" readers, and Howard wrote more tales of Conan, of which 17 were published in the magazine.\nDevelopment.\nThe success of Howard's work encouraged other \"Weird Tales\" writers to create similar tales of adventure in imagined lands. Clark Ashton Smith wrote his tales of the Hyperborean cycle and Zothique for \"Weird Tales\" in the 1930s. These stories revolved around the exploits of warriors and sorcerers in lands of the remote past or remote future, and often had downbeat endings. C. L. Moore, inspired by Howard, Smith and H. P. Lovecraft, created the Jirel of Joiry stories for \"Weird Tales\", which brought in the first sword and sorcery heroine. Moore's future husband Henry Kuttner created Elak of Atlantis, a Howard-inspired warrior hero, for \"Weird Tales\" in 1938.\nFollowing a change of ownership in 1940, \"Weird Tales\" ceased to publish sword and sorcery stories. However, the pulp magazine \"Unknown Worlds\" continued to publish sword and sorcery fiction by Fritz Leiber and Norvell W. Page. Leiber's stories revolved around a duo of heroes called Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and dealt with their adventures in the world of Nehwon (\"No-When\" backwards). Leiber's stories featured more emphasis on characterisation and humour than previous sword and sorcery fiction, and his characters became popular with \"Unknown's\" readers. Page's sword and sorcery tales centred on Prester John, a Howard-inspired gladiator adventurer, whose exploits took place in Central Asia in the first century CE.\nWith the diminution of pulp magazine sales in the late 1940s, the focus of sword and sorcery shifted to small-press books. Arkham House published collections by Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith and Fritz Leiber that included some of their sword and sorcery work. Writer Jack Vance published the book \"The Dying Earth\" in 1950. \"The Dying Earth\" described the adventures of rogues and wizards on a decadent far-future Earth, where magic had replaced science.\nRise in popularity.\nIn the 1960s, American paperback publisher Lancer Books began to reissue Robert E. Howard's \"Conan\" stories in paperback, with cover illustrations by artist Frank Frazetta. These editions became surprise bestsellers, selling millions of copies to a largely young readership. The commercial success of the Conan books encouraged other publishers to put out new and reprinted books in the style of Howard's work.\nInitial works in the 1960s by other authors closely followed the Conan mould, with Lin Carter's Thongor of Lemuria, Gardner F. Fox's Kothar the Barbarian, and John Jakes' Brak the Barbarian being the most popular of the imitators. Notably different works were Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone stories, which were designed to be in counterpoint with the barbarian trope, and the revival of interest in the original Fafhrd &amp; Gray Mouser stories with their focus on urbane rogues, by Fritz Leiber led to Leiber writing new stories with the characters that he would periodically revisit throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\nDespite this, the initial barbarian-focused boom crashed in the early seventies, before the mid-1970s led to newer, more varied authors and books being published with it, such as Andre Norton, David Drake, Tanith Lee, Charles R. Saunders, Michael Shea, Karl Edward Wagner, and others.\nFrom the 1960s until the 1980s, under the guiding force of Carter, a select group of writers formed the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA) to promote and enlarge the sword and sorcery genre. From 1973 to 1981, five anthologies featuring short works by SAGA members were published. Edited by Carter, these were collectively known as \"Flashing Swords!\" Because of these and other anthologies, such as the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, his own fiction, and his criticism, Carter is considered one of the most important popularizers of genre fantasy in general, and S&amp;S in particular.\nDespite such authors' efforts, some critics use sword and sorcery as a dismissive or pejorative term. During the 1980s, influenced by the success of the 1982 feature film \"Conan the Barbarian\", many fantasy films, some cheaply made, were released in a subgenre that would be called \"sword and sorcery\".\nThe sword and sorcery boom is said to have begun with \"Hawk the Slayer\" (1980). Other examples of sword and sorcery films include \"The Beastmaster\" (1982), \"The Sword and the Sorcerer\" (1982), \"Hercules\" (1983), a Conan sequel, \"Conan the Destroyer\" (1984), \"Ladyhawke\" (1985) and \"Red Sonja\" (1985), which, like the Conan films, also stars Arnold Schwarzenegger. The sword and planet film \"Masters of the Universe\" (1987) contains elements of sword and sorcery and has been called a Conan hybrid.\n\"Clash of the Titans\" (1981), \"Excalibur\" (1981), \"Dragonslayer\" (1981), and \"Krull\" (1983) are characterised as sword and sorcery films by some writers, but this is disputed by Butler. \"Star Wars\" (1977) was influenced by sword and sorcery, and in turn influenced \"Legend of the Eight Samurai\" (1983), a Japanese sword and sorcery style film.\nAfter the cinema and literary boom of the early to mid-1980s, sword and sorcery once again dropped out of favor, with epic fantasy largely taking its place in the fantasy genre. There was, though, another resurgence in sword and sorcery at the end of the 20th century. Sometimes called the \"new\" or \"literary\" sword and sorcery, this development places emphasis on literary technique, and draws from epic fantasy and other genres to broaden the genre's typical scope. Stories may feature the wide-ranging struggles of national or world-spanning concerns common to high fantasy, but told from the point of view of characters more common to S&amp;S, and with the sense of adventure common to the latter. Writers associated with this include Steven Erikson, Joe Abercrombie, and Scott Lynch, magazines such as \"Black Gate\" and the ezines \"Flashing Swords\" (not to be confused with the Lin Carter anthologies), and \"Beneath Ceaseless Skies\" publish short fiction in the style. According to the literary critic Higashi Masao regarding Japanese works \"Guin Saga\" and \"Sorcerous Stabber Orphen\", they were initially planned by their authors as novels that could be classified as belonging to the European sword and sorcery subgenre but had various major elements that distanced themselves from the typical novels in the genre.\nIn the 1990s, sword and sorcery boomed in popularity in Great Britain and other parts of the world.\nWomen creators and characters.\nRobert E. Howard espoused feminist views in his personal and professional life. He wrote to his friends and associates defending the achievements and capabilities of women. Strong female characters in Howard's works of fiction include Dark Agnes de Chastillon (first appearing in \"Sword Woman\", circa 1932\u201334), the early modern pirate Helen Tavrel (\"The Isle of Pirates' Doom\", 1928), as well as two pirates and Conan the Barbarian supporting characters, B\u00ealit (\"Queen of the Black Coast\", 1934), and Valeria of the Red Brotherhood (\"Red Nails\", 1936).\nIntroduced as the co-star in a non-fantasy historical story by Howard entitled \"The Shadow of the Vulture\", Red Sonya of Rogatino later inspired a fantasy heroine named Red Sonja, who first appeared in the comic book series \"Conan the Barbarian\" written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Barry Windsor-Smith. Red Sonja got her own comic book title and eventually a series of novels by David C. Smith and Richard L. Tierney, as well as Richard Fleischer's film adaptation in 1985.\nCatherine Moore was another foundational author of the sword and sorcery genre during its earliest years with her Jirel of Joiry stories. Several other women lead the beginnings of this genre, including Leigh Brackett, Nathalie Henneberg, and Andre Norton.\nDespite this, sword and sorcery has been criticized for having a masculine bias; This includes criticism of the aforementioned authors. Female characters were often distressed damsels to be rescued or protected, or otherwise served as a reward for a male hero's adventures. Those who had adventures of their own often did so to counter the threat of rape or to take revenge for it. These issues were particularly relevant in the 1960s through the late 1980s, but are often characteristic of even some of the earliest Sword and Sorcery stories.\nTanith Lee's 1975 novel \"The Birthgrave\" and later novels focused on women's roles in standard sword and sorcery era narratives. The Morgaine cycle of novels from C. J. Cherryh, which began in 1976, also focused on a female lead while engaging in a traditional heroic fantasy lead. This led to them and other female authors being inducted into Lin Carter's Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America.\nJessica Amanda Salmonson similarly sought to broaden the range of roles for female characters in sword and sorcery through her own stories and through editing the World Fantasy Award-winning \"Amazons\" (1979) and \"Amazons II\" (1982) anthologies; both drew on real and folkloric female warriors, often from outside of Europe.\nMarion Zimmer Bradley's \"Sword and Sorceress\" anthology series (1984 onwards) challenged these archetypes. The stories feature skillful swordswomen and powerful sorceresses working from a variety of motives.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

R. R. Tolkien's novels \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". He is a wizard, one of the Istari order, and the leader of the Company of the Ring. Tolkien took the name \"Gandalf\" from the Old Norse \"Catalogue of Dwarves\" (\"Dvergatal\") in the \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\".\nAs a wizard and the bearer of one of the Three Rings, Gandalf has great power, but works mostly by encouraging and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge and travelling continually. Gandalf is focused on the mission to counter the Dark Lord Sauron by destroying the One Ring. He is associated with fire; his ring of power is Narya, the Ring of Fire. As such, he delights in fireworks to entertain the hobbits of the Shire, while in great need he uses fire as a weapon. As one of the Maiar, he is an immortal spirit from Valinor, but his physical body can be killed. \nIn \"The Hobbit\", Gandalf assists the 13 dwarves and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins with their quest to retake the Lonely Mountain from Smaug the dragon, but leaves them to urge the White Council to expel Sauron from his fortress of Dol Guldur. In the course of the quest, Bilbo finds a magical ring. The expulsion succeeds, but in \"The Lord of the Rings\", Gandalf reveals that Sauron's retreat was only a feint, as he soon reappeared in Mordor. Gandalf further explains that, after years of investigation, he is sure that Bilbo's ring is the One Ring that Sauron needs to dominate the whole of Middle-earth. The Council of Elrond creates the Fellowship of the Ring, with Gandalf as its leader, to defeat Sauron by destroying the Ring. He takes them south through the Misty Mountains, but is killed fighting a Balrog, an evil spirit-being, in the underground realm of Moria. After he dies, he is sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission as Gandalf the White. He reappears to three of the Fellowship and helps to counter the enemy in Rohan, then in Gondor, and finally at the Black Gate of Mordor, in each case largely by offering guidance. When victory is complete, he crowns Aragorn as King before leaving Middle-earth for ever to return to Valinor.\nTolkien once described Gandalf as an angel incarnate; later, both he and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the Norse god Odin in his \"Wanderer\" guise. Others have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonists, comparable to the Cumaean Sibyl who assisted Aeneas in Virgil's \"The Aeneid\", or to the figure of Virgil in Dante's \"Inferno\". Scholars have likened his return in white to the transfiguration of Christ; he is further described as a prophet, representing one element of Christ's threefold office of prophet, priest, and king, where the other two roles are taken by Frodo and Aragorn. \nThe Gandalf character has been featured in radio, television, stage, video game, music, and film adaptations, including Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film. His best-known portrayal is by Ian McKellen in Peter Jackson's 2001\u20132003 \"The Lord of the Rings\" film series, where the actor based his acclaimed performance on Tolkien himself. McKellen reprised the role in Jackson's 2012\u20132014 film series \"The Hobbit\".\nNames.\nEtymology.\nTolkien derived the name \"Gandalf\" from Gand\u00e1lfr, a dwarf in the V\u00f6lusp\u00e1's \"Dvergatal\", a list of dwarf-names. In Old Norse, the name means \"staff-elf\". This is reflected in his name \"Thark\u00fbn\", which is \"said to mean 'Staff-man'\" in Khuzdul, the language Tolkien invented for his Dwarves.\nIn-universe names.\nGandalf is given several names and epithets in Tolkien's writings. Faramir calls him the Grey Pilgrim, and reports Gandalf as saying, \"Many are my names in many countries. \"Mithrandir\" among the Elves, Thark\u00fbn to the Dwarves, Ol\u00f3rin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Inc\u00e1nus, in the North \"Gandalf\"; to the East I go not.\" In an early draft of \"The Hobbit\", he is called \"Bladorthin\", while the dwarf who was later named Thorin Oakenshield is named Gandalf.\nEach Wizard is distinguished by the colour of his cloak. For most of his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf's cloak is grey, hence the names Gandalf \"the Grey\" and Greyhame, from Old English hama, \"cover, skin\". \"Mithrandir\" is a name in Sindarin meaning \"Grey Pilgrim\" or \"Grey Wanderer\". Midway through \"The Lord of the Rings\", Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed Gandalf the White. This change in status (and clothing) introduces another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters who speak Elvish still refer to him as \"Mithrandir\". At times in \"The Lord of the Rings\", other characters address Gandalf by insulting nicknames: Stormcrow, \"L\u00e1thspell\" (\"Ill-news\" in Old English), and \"Grey Fool\".\nCharacteristics.\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in Middle-earth, one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a staff\". Yet the Elf C\u00edrdan who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven Ring of Power called Narya, the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element fire later in the same essay:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya), for he was the Enemy of Sauron, opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly to the young and simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and the rebuking of folly; but he was not proud, and sought neither power nor praise ... Mostly he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning on a staff, and so he was called among Men of the North Gandalf 'the Elf of the Wand'. For they deemed him (though in error) to be of Elven-kind, since he would at times work wonders among them, loving especially the beauty of fire; and yet such marvels he wrought mostly for mirth and delight, and desired not that any should hold him in awe or take his counsels out of fear. ... Yet it is said that in the ending of the task for which he came he suffered greatly, and was slain, and being sent back from death for a brief while was clothed then in white, and became a radiant flame (yet veiled still save in great need).\nFictional biography.\nValinor.\nIn Valinor, Gandalf, a Maia, was named \"Ol\u00f3rin\", one of the people of the Vala Manw\u00eb, and the wisest of the Maiar. He was closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and Nienna, the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to send the Wizards (Istari) across the Great Sea to Middle-earth to assist those who opposed Sauron, Manw\u00eb proposed Ol\u00f3rin. Ol\u00f3rin initially begged to be excused, declaring he was too weak and feared Sauron; Manw\u00eb replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.\nAs a Maia, Gandalf was an angelic being in human form, in service to the Creator (Eru Il\u00favatar) and the Creator's 'Secret Fire'. He took on the specific form of an old man as a sign of his humility. His role was to advise but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength. It might be, too, that the lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man.\nMiddle-earth.\nThe wizards arrived in Middle-earth separately, early in the Third Age; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but C\u00edrdan the Shipwright felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him Narya, the Ring of Fire. Saruman, the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well. His relationship with Saruman was strained. The Wizards were forbidden to use force to dominate, though Saruman increasingly disregarded this.\nThe White Council.\nGandalf suspected early on that an evil presence, the Necromancer of Dol Guldur, was Sauron. He went to Dol Guldur to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew, only to return with greater force, and the White Council was formed in response. Galadriel had hoped Gandalf would lead the council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about Sauron's work in the Second Age.\nGandalf returned to Dol Guldur \"at great peril\" and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. The following year a White Council was held, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out. Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident effort to find the One Ring would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river Anduin to the Sea; and the matter was allowed to rest. But Saruman began actively seeking the Ring near the Gladden Fields where Isildur had been killed.\nThe Quest of Erebor.\n\"The Quest of Erebor\" in \"Unfinished Tales\" elaborates upon the story behind \"The Hobbit\". It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield, a Dwarf-king in exile, in the \"Prancing Pony\" inn at Bree. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with Sauron, and knew that the North was especially vulnerable. If Rivendell were to be attacked, the dragon Smaug could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of Erebor from Smaug, and so the quest was born.\n\"The Hobbit\".\nGandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of \"The Hobbit\". He arranges for a tea party, to which he invites the thirteen dwarves, and thus arranges the travelling group central to the narrative. Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor to assist the quest. On this quest Gandalf acquires the sword, \"Glamdring\", from the trolls' treasure hoard. Elrond informs them that the sword was made in Gondolin, a city long ago destroyed, where Elrond's father lived as a child.\nAfter escaping from the Misty Mountains pursued by goblins and wargs, the party is carried to safety by the Great Eagles. Gandalf then persuades Beorn to house and provision the company for the trip through Mirkwood. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.\nHe turns up again before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of Esgaroth and the Mirkwood Elves will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties. After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to the Shire, revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the One Ring to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood. Then the Council \"put[s] forth its power\" and drives Sauron from Dol Guldur. Sauron had anticipated this, and had feigned a withdrawal, only to reappear in Mordor.\n\"The Lord of the Rings\".\nGandalf the Grey.\nGandalf spent the years between \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" travelling Middle-earth in search of information on Sauron's resurgence and Bilbo Baggins's mysterious ring, spurred particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a \"present\" from Gollum. During this period, he befriended Aragorn and became suspicious of Saruman. He spent as much time as he could in the Shire, strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and Frodo, Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.\nGandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's \"eleventy-first\" (111th) birthday party, bringing many fireworks for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the ring and disappears, Gandalf urges his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile, accusing Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf tells Bilbo he is being foolish. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for Rivendell.\nOver the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for the truth about the ring. He finds the answer in Isildur's scroll, in the archives of Minas Tirith. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, often assisted by Aragorn, who eventually captures Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron had imprisoned Gollum in his fortress of Barad-d\u00fbr, and tortured him to reveal what he knew of the Ring.\nReturning to the Shire, Gandalf confirms his suspicion by throwing the Ring into Frodo's hearth-fire and reading the writing that appears on its surface. He tells Frodo the history of the ring, and urges him to take it to Rivendell, warning of grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says he will attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of Sauron will be searching for him.\nOutside the Shire, Gandalf encounters the wizard Radagast the Brown, who brings the news that the Nazg\u00fbl have ridden out of Mordor\u2014and a request from Saruman that Gandalf come to Isengard. Gandalf asks him to send out animals to observe the Nazg\u00fbl, and to report to him at Isengard. Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at the Prancing Pony, and heads towards Isengard. There, Saruman horrifies Gandalf by asking him to help him to obtain and use the Ring. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the Eagle, who comes to him as requested via Radagast.\nIn Rohan, Gandalf appeals to King Th\u00e9oden for a horse. Th\u00e9oden, under the influence of Saruman's spy Gr\u00edma Wormtongue, tells Gandalf to take any horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, who will be his mount and companion. Gandalf reaches the Shire after Frodo has set out. Knowing that Frodo will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his way there. He learns at Bree that the Hobbits have fallen in with Aragorn. He faces the Nazg\u00fbl at Weathertop, escaping after an all-night battle, drawing four of them northwards. Frodo, Aragorn and company face the remaining five on Weathertop a few nights later. Gandalf reaches Rivendell just before Frodo.\nAt Rivendell, Gandalf helps Elrond drive off the Nazg\u00fbl pursuing Frodo, and plays a leading role in the Council of Elrond as the only person who knows the full history of the Ring. He reveals that Saruman has betrayed them and is in league with Sauron. When it is decided that the Ring has to be destroyed, Gandalf volunteers to accompany Frodo\u2014now the Ring-bearer\u2014in his quest. He persuades Elrond to let Frodo's cousins Merry and Pippin join the Company of the Ring.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm. \"You cannot pass,\" he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. \"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Ud\u00fbn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.\"\n J. R. R. Tolkien\n , \"The Fellowship of the Ring\"\nTaking charge of the Company, Gandalf and Aragorn lead the Hobbits and their companions south. After failing to cross Mount Caradhras in winter, they cross under the Misty Mountains through the Mines of Moria. There, they discover that the dwarf colony established by Balin has been annihilated by orcs. The Company fights with the orcs and trolls of Moria and escapes them.\nAt the Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm, they encounter \"Durin's Bane,\" a fearsome Balrog. Gandalf faces the Balrog to enable the others to escape. After a brief exchange of blows, Gandalf breaks the bridge beneath the Balrog with his staff. As the Balrog falls, it wraps its whip around Gandalf's legs, dragging him over the edge. Gandalf falls into the abyss, crying \"Fly, you fools!\".\nGandalf and the Balrog fall into a deep lake in Moria's underworld. Gandalf pursues the Balrog through the tunnels for eight days until they climb to the peak of Zirakzigil. Here they fight for two days and nights. The Balrog is defeated and cast down onto the mountainside. Gandalf also dies, and his body lies on the peak while his spirit travels \"out of thought and time\".\nGandalf the White.\nHe is \"sent back\" as Gandalf the White, and returns to life on the mountain top. Gwaihir carries him to Lothl\u00f3rien, where he is healed and re-clothed in white by Galadriel. He travels to Fangorn Forest, where he encounters Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. They mistake him for Saruman; he stops their attacks and reveals himself.\nThey travel to Rohan, where Gandalf finds that Th\u00e9oden has been weakened by Wormtongue's influence. He breaks Wormtongue's hold over Th\u00e9oden, and convinces the king to join the fight against Sauron. Gandalf sets off to gather warriors of the Westfold for the coming battle with Saruman. He arrives just in time to defeat Saruman's army in the battle of Helm's Deep. Gandalf and the King ride to Isengard, which has just been destroyed by Treebeard and his Ents, accompanied by Merry and Pippin. Gandalf breaks Saruman's staff and expels him from the White Council and the Order of Wizards; he takes Saruman's place as head of both. Wormtongue tries to kill Gandalf or Saruman with the \"palant\u00edr\" of Orthanc, but misses both. Pippin retrieves the \"palant\u00edr\"; Gandalf quickly takes it. After leaving Isengard, Pippin takes the \"palant\u00edr\" from a sleeping Gandalf, looks into it, and comes face to face with Sauron. Gandalf gives the \"palant\u00edr\" to Aragorn and takes the chastened Pippin with him to Minas Tirith to keep him out of further trouble.\nGandalf arrives in time to help to arrange the defences of Minas Tirith. His presence is resented by Denethor, the Steward of Gondor; but when his son Faramir is gravely wounded in battle, Denethor sinks into despair and madness. Together with Prince Imrahil, Gandalf leads the defenders during the siege of the city. When the forces of Mordor break the main gate, Gandalf, alone on Shadowfax, confronts the Lord of the Nazg\u00fbl. At that moment the Rohirrim arrive, causing the Nazg\u00fbl to withdraw. Gandalf is about to pursue, but is stopped by Pippin, who requests his intervention to save Faramir \u2013 Denethor in desperation was seeking to burn himself and his son on a funeral pyre. Gandalf saves Faramir (but not Denethor, who immolates himself), and plays no further part in the unfolding Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"This, then, is my counsel,\" [said Gandalf.] \"We have not the Ring. In wisdom or great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed, lest it destroy us. Without it we cannot by force defeat [Sauron's] force. But we must at all costs keep his Eye from his true peril... We must call out his hidden strength, so that he shall empty his land... We must make ourselves the bait, though his jaws should close on us... We must walk open-eyed into that trap, with courage, but small hope for ourselves. For, my lords, it may well prove that we ourselves shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if Barad-d\u00fbr be thrown down, we shall not live to see a new age. But this, I deem, is our duty.\"\n J. R. R. Tolkien\n , \"The Return of the King\"\nAfter the battle, Gandalf counsels an attack against Sauron's forces at the Black Gate, to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam; they are at that moment scaling Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. Gandalf and Aragorn lead an army to the Black Gate, meeting the nameless lieutenant of Mordor, who shows them Frodo's \"mithril\" shirt and other items from the Hobbits' equipment. Gandalf rejects Mordor's terms of surrender, starting the Battle of the Morannon. The forces of the West face the full might of Sauron's armies, until the Ring is destroyed in Mount Doom. Gandalf leads the Eagles to rescue Frodo and Sam from the erupting mountain.\nAfter the war, Gandalf crowns Aragorn as King Elessar, and helps him find a sapling of the White Tree of Gondor. He accompanies the Hobbits back to the borders of the Shire, before leaving to visit Tom Bombadil.\nTwo years later, Gandalf departs Middle-earth forever. He boards the Ringbearers' ship in the Grey Havens and sets sail to return across the sea to the Undying Lands; with him are his horse Shadowfax and his friends Frodo, Bilbo, Galadriel, and Elrond.\nConcept and creation.\nAppearance.\nTolkien's biographer Humphrey Carpenter relates that Tolkien owned a postcard entitled \"Der Berggeist\" (\"the mountain spirit\"), which he labelled \"the origin of Gandalf\". It shows a white-bearded man in a large hat and cloak seated among boulders in a mountain forest. Carpenter said that Tolkien recalled buying the postcard during his holiday in Switzerland in 1911. Manfred Zimmerman, however, discovered that the painting was by the German artist Josef Madlener and dates from the mid-1920s. Carpenter acknowledged that Tolkien was probably mistaken about the origin of the postcard. \nAn additional influence may have been V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen, a demigod and the central character in Finnish folklore and the national epic \"Kalevala\" by Elias L\u00f6nnrot. V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen was described as an old and wise man, and he possessed a potent, magical singing voice.\nThroughout the early drafts, and through to the first edition of \"The Hobbit\", Bladorthin/Gandalf is described as being a \"little old man\", distinct from a dwarf, but not of the full human stature that would later be described in \"The Lord of the Rings\". Even in \"The Lord of the Rings\", Gandalf was not tall; shorter, for example, than Elrond or the other wizards.\nName.\nWhen writing \"The Hobbit\" in the early 1930s Tolkien gave the name \"Gandalf\" to the leader of the Dwarves, the character later called Thorin Oakenshield. The name is taken from the same source as all the other Dwarf names (save Balin) in \"The Hobbit\": the \"\" in the \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\". The Old Norse name ' incorporates the words ' meaning \"wand\", \"staff\" or (especially in compounds) \"magic\" and \"\" \"elf\". The name \"Gandalf\" is found in at least one more place in Norse myth, in the semi-historical Heimskringla, which briefly describes Gandalf Alfgeirsson, a legendary Norse king from eastern Norway and rival of Halfdan the Black. Gandalf is also the name of a Norse sea-king in Henrik Ibsen's second play, \"The Burial Mound\". The name \"Gandolf\" occurs as a character in William Morris' 1896 fantasy novel \"The Well at the World's End\", along with the horse \"Silverfax\", adapted by Tolkien as Gandalf's horse \"Shadowfax\". Morris' book, inspired by Norse myth, is set in a pseudo-medieval landscape; it deeply influenced Tolkien. The wizard that became Gandalf was originally named \"Bladorthin\".\nTolkien came to regret his \"ad hoc\" use of Old Norse names, referring to a \"rabble of eddaic-named dwarves,\u00a0... invented in an idle hour\" in 1937. But the decision to use Old Norse names came to have far-reaching consequences in the composition of \"The Lord of the Rings\"; in 1942, Tolkien decided that the work was to be a purported translation from the fictional language of Westron, and in the English translation Old Norse names were taken to represent names in the language of Dale. \"Gandalf\", in this setting, is thus a representation in English (anglicised from Old Norse) of the name the Dwarves of Erebor had given to Ol\u00f3rin in the language they used \"externally\" in their daily affairs, while \"Thark\u00fbn\" is the (untranslated) name, presumably of the same meaning, that the Dwarves gave him in their native Khuzdul language.\nAnalysis.\nGuide.\nGandalf's role and importance was substantially increased in the conception of \"The Lord of the Rings\", and in a letter of 1954, Tolkien refers to Gandalf as an \"angel incarnate\". In the same letter Tolkien states he was given the form of an old man to limit his powers on Earth. Both in 1965 and 1971 Tolkien again refers to Gandalf as an angelic being.\nIn a 1946 letter, Tolkien stated that he thought of Gandalf as an \"Odinic wanderer\". Other commentators have similarly compared Gandalf to the Norse god Odin in his \"Wanderer\" guise\u2014an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff, or likened him to Merlin of Arthurian legend or the Jungian archetype of the \"wise old man\".\nIn \"The Annotated Hobbit\", Douglas Anderson likens Gandalf's role to the \"R\u00fcbezahl\" mountain spirit of German folktales. He states that the figure can appear as \"a guide, a messenger, or a farmer\", often depicted as \"a bearded man with a staff\".\nThe Tolkien scholar Charles W. Nelson described Gandalf as a \"guide who .. assists a major character on a journey or quest .. to unusual and distant places\". He noted that in both \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" and \"The Hobbit\", Tolkien presents Gandalf in these terms. Immediately after the Council of Elrond, Gandalf tells the Fellowship:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNelson notes the similarity between this and Thorin's statement in \"The Hobbit\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNelson gives as examples of the guide figure the Cumaean Sibyl who assisted Aeneas on his journey through the underworld in Virgil's tale \"The Aeneid\", and then the figure of Virgil in Dante's \"Inferno\", directing, encouraging, and physically assisting Dante as he travels through hell. In English literature, Nelson notes, Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" has the wizard Merlin teaching and directing Arthur to begin his journeys. Given these precedents, Nelson remarks, it was unsurprising that Tolkien should make use of a guide figure, endowing him, like these predecessors, with power, wisdom, experience, and practical knowledge, and \"aware[ness] of [his] own limitations and [his] ranking in the order of the great\". Other characters who act as wise and good guides include Tom Bombadil, Elrond, Aragorn, Galadriel\u2014who he calls perhaps the most powerful of the guide figures\u2014and briefly also Faramir.\nNelson writes that there is equally historical precedent for wicked guides, such as Edmund Spenser's \"evil palmers\" in \"The Faerie Queene\", and suggests that Gollum functions as an evil guide, contrasted with Gandalf, in \"Lord of the Rings\". He notes that both Gollum and Gandalf are servants of The One, Eru Il\u00favatar, in the struggle against the forces of darkness, and \"ironically\" all of them, good and bad, are necessary to the success of the quest. He comments, too, that despite Gandalf's evident power, and the moment when he faces the Lord of the Nazg\u00fbl, he stays in the role of guide throughout, \"never directly confront[ing] his enemies with his raw power.\"\nChrist-figure.\nThe critic Anne C. Petty, writing about \"Allegory\" in the \"J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\", discusses Gandalf's death and reappearance in Christian terms. She cites Michael W. Maher, S.J.: \"who could not think of Gandalf's descent into the pits of Moria and his return clothed in white as a death-resurrection motif?\" She at once notes, however, that \"such a narrow [allegorical] interpretation\" limits the reader's imagination by demanding a single meaning for each character and event. Other scholars and theologians have likened Gandalf's return as a \"gleaming white\" figure to the transfiguration of Christ.\nThe philosopher Peter Kreeft, like Tolkien a Roman Catholic, observes that there is no one complete, concrete, visible Christ figure in \"The Lord of the Rings\" comparable to Aslan in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia series. However, Kreeft and Jean Chausse have identified reflections of the figure of Jesus Christ in three protagonists of \"The Lord of the Rings\": Gandalf, Frodo and Aragorn. While Chausse found \"facets of the personality of Jesus\" in them, Kreeft wrote that \"they exemplify the Old Testament threefold Messianic symbolism of prophet (Gandalf), priest (Frodo), and king (Aragorn).\"\nAdaptations.\nIn the BBC Radio dramatisations, Gandalf has been voiced by Norman Shelley in \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1955\u20131956), Heron Carvic in \"The Hobbit\" (1968), Bernard Mayes in \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1979), and Sir Michael Hordern in \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1981).\nJohn Huston voiced Gandalf in the animated films \"The Hobbit\" (1977) and \"The Return of the King\" (1980) produced by Rankin/Bass. William Squire voiced Gandalf in the animated film \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1978) directed by Ralph Bakshi. Ivan Krasko played Gandalf in the Soviet film adaptation \"The Hobbit\" (1985). Gandalf was portrayed by Vesa Vierikko in the Finnish television miniseries \"Hobitit\" (1993).\nIan McKellen portrayed Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\" film series (2001\u20132003), directed by Peter Jackson, after Sean Connery and Patrick Stewart both turned down the role. According to Jackson, McKellen based his performance as Gandalf on Tolkien himself:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We listened to audio recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from \"Lord of the Rings\". We watched some BBC interviews with him\u2014there's a few interviews with Tolkien\u2014and Ian based his performance on an impersonation of Tolkien. He's literally basing Gandalf on Tolkien. He sounds the same, he uses the speech patterns and his mannerisms are born out of the same roughness from the footage of Tolkien. So, Tolkien would recognize himself in Ian's performance.\nMcKellen confirmed this, and stated that he enjoyed Tolkien's letters and readings from the novels. \"I am encouraged by the theatricality of his readings full of rhythm and humour and characterisation. Without question Gandalf is like Tolkien but then so, I suspect, are Frodo and Aragorn.\" \nMcKellen received widespread acclaim for his portrayal of Gandalf, particularly in ', for which he received a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Academy Award nomination, both for best supporting actor. \"Empire\" named Gandalf, as portrayed by McKellen, the 30th greatest film character of all time. He reprised the role in \"The Hobbit\" film series (2012\u20132014), claiming that he enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than Gandalf the White. He voiced Gandalf for several video games based on the films, including ', ', and '.\nIn the prequel series \"\", Daniel Weyman portrays a younger version of Gandalf, who is only known as the Stranger until the final episode of the second season, partly because the character functioned as a red herring for the identity of the show's version of Sauron.\nCharles Picard portrayed Gandalf in the 1999 stage production of \"The Two Towers\" at Chicago's Lifeline Theatre. Brent Carver portrayed Gandalf in the 2006 musical production \"The Lord of the Rings\", which opened in Toronto.\nGandalf appears in \"The Lego Movie\", voiced by Todd Hanson. Gandalf is a main character in the video game \"Lego Dimensions\" and is voiced by Tom Kane.\nGandalf has his own movement in Johan de Meij's Symphony No. 1 \"The Lord of the Rings\", which was written for concert band and premiered in 1988. \nIn Aulis Sallinen's Symphony No. 7, Op. 71 'The Dreams of Gandalf', the Gandalf theme has the note sequence G-A-D-A-F, \"Gandalf\" as far as can be formed with the notes A to G. The result is a \"striving, rising theme\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are those of the pulmonary and fetal circulations which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. In the systemic circulation, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, and veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart, in the deep veins.\nThere are three sizes of veins: large, medium, and small. Smaller veins are called venules, and the smallest the post-capillary venules are microscopic that make up the veins of the microcirculation. Veins are often closer to the skin than arteries.\nVeins have less smooth muscle and connective tissue and wider internal diameters than arteries. Because of their thinner walls and wider lumens they are able to expand and hold more blood. This greater capacity gives them the term of \"capacitance vessels\". At any time, nearly 70% of the total volume of blood in the human body is in the veins. In medium and large sized veins the flow of blood is maintained by one-way (unidirectional) venous valves to prevent backflow. In the lower limbs this is also aided by muscle pumps, also known as venous pumps that exert pressure on intramuscular veins when they contract and drive blood back to the heart.\nStructure.\nThere are three sizes of vein, large, medium, and small. Smaller veins are called venules. The smallest veins are the post-capillary venules. Veins have a similar three-layered structure to arteries. The layers known as tunicae have a concentric arrangement that forms the wall of the vessel. The outer layer, is a thick layer of connective tissue called the tunica externa or \"adventitia\"; this layer is absent in the post-capillary venules. The middle layer, consists of bands of smooth muscle and is known as the tunica media. The inner layer, is a thin lining of endothelium known as the tunica intima. The tunica media in the veins is much thinner than that in the arteries as the veins are not subject to the high systolic pressures that the arteries are. There are valves present in many veins that maintain unidirectional flow.\nUnlike arteries, the precise location of veins varies among individuals.\nVeins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons. The factors that contribute to this alteration of color perception are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and the processing of visual input by the visual cortex, rather than the actual colour of the venous blood which is dark red.\nVenous system.\nThe venous system is the system of veins in the systemic and pulmonary circulations that return blood to the heart. In the systemic circulation the return is of deoxygenated blood from the organs and tissues of the body, and in the pulmonary circulation the pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. Almost 70% of the blood in the body is in the veins, and almost 75% of this blood is in the small veins and venules. All of the systemic veins are tributaries of the largest veins, the superior and inferior vena cava, which empty the oxygen-depleted blood into the right atrium of the heart. The thin walls of the veins, and their greater internal diameters (lumens) enable them to hold a greater volume of blood, and this greater capacitance gives them the term of \"capacitance vessels\". This characteristic also allows for the accommodation of pressure changes in the system. The whole of the venous system, bar the post-capillary venules is a large volume, low pressure system. The venous system is often asymmetric, and whilst the main veins hold a relatively constant position, unlike arteries, the precise location of veins varies among individuals.\nVeins vary in size from the smallest post-capillary venules, and more muscular venules, to small veins, medium veins, and large veins. The thickness of the walls of the veins varies as to their location \u2013 in the legs the vein walls are much thicker than those in the arms. In the circulatory system, blood first enters the venous system from capillary beds where arterial blood changes to venous blood.\nLarge arteries such as the thoracic aorta, subclavian, femoral and popliteal arteries lie close to a single vein that drains the same region. Other arteries are often accompanied by a pair of veins held in a connective tissue sheath. The accompanying veins are known as venae comitantes, or \"satellite veins\", and they run on either side of the artery. When an associated nerve is also enclosed, the sheath is known as a neurovascular bundle. This close proximity of the artery to the veins helps in venous return due to the pulsations in the artery. It also allows for the promotion of heat transfer from the larger arteries to the veins in a counterflow exchange that helps to preserve normal body heat.\nThe first entry of venous blood is from the convergence of two or more capillaries into a microscopic, post-capillary venule. Post-capillary venules have a diameter of between 10 and 30 micrometres (\u03bcm), and are part of the microcirculation. Their endothelium is made up of flattened oval or polygon shaped cells surrounded by a basal lamina. Post-capillary venules are too small to have a smooth muscle layer and are instead supported by pericytes that wrap around them. Post-capillary venules become muscular venules when they reach a diameter of 50\u00a0\u03bcm, and can reach a diameter of 1\u00a0mm. These larger venules feed into small veins.\nThe small veins merge to feed as tributaries into medium-sized veins. The medium veins feed into the large veins which include the internal jugular, and renal veins, and the venae cavae that carry the blood directly into the heart. The venae cavae enter the right atrium of the heart from above and below. From above, the superior vena cava carries blood from the arms, head, and chest to the right atrium of the heart, and from below, the inferior vena cava carries blood from the legs and abdomen to the right atrium. The inferior vena cava is the larger of the two. The inferior vena cava is retroperitoneal and runs to the right and roughly parallel to the abdominal aorta along the spine.\nThe three main compartments of the venous system are the deep veins, the superficial veins, and the perforator veins. Superficial veins are those closer to the surface of the body, and have no corresponding arteries. Deep veins are deeper in the body and have corresponding arteries. Perforator veins drain from the superficial to the deep veins. These are usually referred to in the lower limbs and feet. Superficial veins include the very small spider veins of between 0.5 and 1\u00a0mm diameter, and reticular or feeder veins.\nThere are a number of venous plexuses where veins are grouped or sometimes combined in networks at certain body sites. The Batson venous plexus, runs through the inner vertebral column connecting the thoracic and pelvic veins. These veins are noted for being valveless, believed to be the reason for metastasis of certain cancers.\nA subcutaneous venous plexus is continuous, and a high rate of flow is supplied by small arteriovenous anastomoses. The high rate of flow ensures heat transfer to the vein wall.\nVenous valves.\nBlood flows back to the heart in the systemic deep veins, with the flow of blood maintained by one-way valves in the deep veins, superficial veins, and in the perforator veins. The venous valves serve to prevent regurgitation (backflow) due to the low pressure of veins, and the pull of gravity. They also serve to prevent the over-widening of the vein.\nA venous valve is bicuspid (having two leaflets) and is formed by an infolding of part of the tunica intima on either side of the lumen of the veins. The leaflets are strengthened with collagen and elastic fibres, and covered with endothelium. The endothelial cells on the surfaces of the leaflets facing the vein wall, are arranged transversely. On the leaflet surfaces that open to let the blood flow, the cells are arranged longitudinally in the direction of the flow. The leaflets are attached to the venous wall at their convex edges. Their margins are concave and are directed with the flow lying against the wall. As the valve forms, the vein wall where the leaflets attach, becomes dilated on each side. These widenings form the pockets, hollow cup-shaped regions, on the cardial side, known as the valvular sinuses. The endothelial cells in the sinuses are able to stretch twice as much as those in areas without valves. When the blood tries to reverse its direction (due to low venous pressure and the pull of gravity), the sinuses fill first closing the leaflets and keeping them together. Approximately 95% of the venous valves are in the small veins of less than 300 micrometres.\nThe deep veins of the lower limb include the common femoral vein, femoral vein, and the deep femoral vein; the popliteal vein, the tibial, and fibular veins. In the common femoral vein one valve is located above the saphenofemoral junction called the \"suprasaphenic valve\". There are sometimes two valves in the same tract. In the femoral vein there are often three valves, the most constantly found valve is just below the joining of the deep femoral vein. The deep femoral vein and its perforators have valves. In the popliteal veins there are between one and three valves; in each posterior tibial vein there are between 8 and 19 valves, and in the anterior tibial veins there are between 8 and 11 valves.\nIn the superficial veins there are between one and seven valves along the thigh portion of the great saphenous vein (GSV); two to six below the knee and one to four in the marginal veins of the foot. There is a valve at the termination of the GSV known as the \"terminal valve\" to prevent reflux from the femoral vein A \"preterminal valve\" is located just below the openings of the tributaries to prevent reflux form these into the GSV. Incompetence of the GSV is a common cause of varicose veins.\nThe valves also divide the column of blood into segments which helps move the blood unidirectionally to the heart. Their action is supported by the action of skeletal muscle pumps that contract and compress the veins. A skeletal muscle is confined in its fascia and contraction of the muscle which makes it wider results In compression on the vein that pushes the blood forward. Valves in the perforating veins close when a calf muscle contracts, to prevent backflow from the deep veins to the superficial. There are more valves in the lower leg, due to increased gravitational pull, with the number decreasing as the veins travel to the hip. There are no valves in the veins of the thorax or abdomen.\nThere is a valve at the junction of the inferior vena cava (one of the great vessels) and the right atrium known as the valve of inferior vena cava also known as the \"eustachian valve\". This valve is an embryological remnant and is insignificant in the adult. However, when persistent it can cause problems.\nCirculatory routes.\nThere are some separate parallel systemic circulatory routes that supply specific regions, and organs. They include the coronary circulation, the cerebral circulation, the bronchial circulation, and the renal circulation.\nIn the coronary circulation, the blood supply to the heart, is drained by cardiac veins (or coronary veins) that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle. These include the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein, the smallest cardiac veins, and the anterior cardiac veins. Cardiac veins carry blood with a poor level of oxygen, from the heart muscle to the right atrium. Most of the blood of the cardiac veins returns through the coronary sinus. The anatomy of the veins of the heart is very variable, but generally it is formed by the following veins: heart veins that go into the coronary sinus: the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein, the posterior vein of the left ventricle, and the oblique vein of the left atrium (oblique vein of Marshall). Heart veins that go directly to the right atrium: the anterior cardiac veins, and the smallest cardiac veins (Thebesian veins).\nIn the bronchial circulation that supplies blood to the lung tissues, bronchial veins drain venous blood from the large main bronchi into the azygous vein, and ultimately the right atrium. Venous blood from the bronchi inside the lungs drains into the pulmonary veins and empties into the left atrium; since this blood never went through a capillary bed it was never oxygenated and so provides a small amount of shunted deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation.\nIn the cerebral circulation supplying the cerebrum the venous drainage can be separated into two subdivisions: superficial and deep.\nThe superficial system is composed of dural venous sinuses, which have walls composed of dura mater as opposed to a traditional vein. The dural sinuses are therefore located on the surface of the cerebrum. The most prominent of these sinuses is the superior sagittal sinus which flows in the sagittal plane under the midline of the cerebral vault, posteriorly and inferiorly to the confluence of sinuses, where the superficial drainage joins with the sinus that primarily drains the deep venous system. From here, two transverse sinuses bifurcate and travel laterally and inferiorly in an S-shaped curve that forms the sigmoid sinuses which go on to form the two jugular veins. In the neck, the jugular veins parallel the upward course of the carotid arteries and drain blood into the superior vena cava.\nThe deep venous drainage is primarily composed of traditional veins inside the deep structures of the brain, which join behind the midbrain to form the vein of Galen. This vein merges with the inferior sagittal sinus to form the straight sinus which then joins the superficial venous system mentioned above at the confluence of sinuses.\nA portal venous system is a series of veins or venules that directly connect two capillary beds. The two systems in verebrates are the hepatic portal system, and the hypophyseal portal system.\nAn anastomosis is a joining of two structures such as blood vessels. In the circulation these are called circulatory anastomoses, one of which is the join between an artery with a vein known as an arteriovenous anastomosis. This connection which is highly muscular, enables venous blood to travel directly from an artery into a vein without having passed from a capillary bed.\nAbnormal connections can be present known as arteriovenous malformations. These are usually congenital and the connections are made from a tangle of capillaries. A cerebral arteriovenous malformation is one that is located in the brain. An irregular connection between an artery and a vein is known as arteriovenous fistula.\nA small specialised arteriovenous anastomosis known as a glomus body or organ serves to transfer heat in the fingers and toes. The small connection is surrounded by a capsule of thickened connective tissue. In the hands and feet there are a great number of glomera.\nA vascular shunt can also bypass the capillary bed and provide a route for blood supply directly to a collecting venule. This is achieved by a metarteriole that supplies around a hundred capillaries. At their junctions are precapillary sphincters that tightly regulate the flow of blood into the capillary bed. When all of the sphincters are closed blood can flow from a metarteriole into a thoroughfare channel and into a collecting venule bypassing the capillary bed.\nA communicating vein directly connects two parts of the same system such as the Giacomini vein that connects the (superficial) small saphenous vein with the (superficial) great saphenous vein. Peripheral veins carry blood from the limbs and hands and feet.\nMicroanatomy.\nThe three layers of the vein wall are the outer tunica externa, the middle tunica media and the inner tunica intima. There are also numerous valves present in many of the veins.\nThe outer tunica externa, also known as the \"tunica adventitia\" is a sheath of thick connective tissue. This layer is absent in the post-capillary venules.\nThe middle tunica media is mainly of vascular smooth muscle cells, elastic fibers and collagen. This layer is much thinner than that in arteries. Vascular smooth muscle cells control the size of the vein lumens, and thereby help to regulate blood pressure.\nThe inner tunica intima is a lining of endothelium comprising a single layer of extremely flattened epithelial cells, supported by delicate connective tissue. This subendothelium is a thin but variable connective tissue. The tunica intima has the most variation in blood vessels, in terms of their wall thickness and relative size of their lumen. The endothelial cells continuously produce nitric oxide a soluble gas, to the cells of the adjacent smooth muscle layer. This constant synthesis is carried out by the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Other endothelial secretions are endothelin, and thromboxane (vasoconstrictors), and prostacyclin a vasodilator.\nDevelopment.\nThe development of the embryo is completely reliant on the vitelline circulation, the bidirectional flow of blood between the yolk sac and the embryo. The yolk sac is the first extraembryonic structure to appear. This circulation is critical in allowing the exchange of nutrients, prior to the full development of the placenta. By day 17 vessels begin to form in the yolk sac, arising from the splanchnic mesoderm of the yolk sac wall. The capillaries are formed during vasculogenesis, and they lengthen and interconnect to form an extensive primitive vascular network. Blood is supplied from the primitive aorta, and drained by vitelline veins from the yolk sac to the embryo. By the end of the third week the yolk sac, connecting stalk, and chorionic villi are entirely vascularised.\nIn the middle of the fourth week the heart begins to beat and the circulation of blood begins. The primitive outflow tract is of three pairs of aortic arches. The inflow tract is formed of six paired veins, the vitelline veins, umbilical veins, and the cardinal veins.\nFunction.\nIn the systemic circulation, veins serve to return oxygen-depleted blood from organs, and tissues to the right heart. From here it passes to the pulmonary arteries for the pulmonary circulation to return oxygen-rich blood to the left heart in the pulmonary veins, to be pumped back into the systemic circulation to complete the cycle. Veins have thinner walls than arteries, and a wider diameter that allow them to expand and hold a greater volume of blood. This gives them a functional role of \"capacitance\" that makes possible the accommodation of different pressures in the system. The venous system apart from the post-capillary venules is a high volume, low pressure system. Vascular smooth muscle cells control the size of the vein lumens, and thereby help to regulate blood pressure.\nThe post-capillary venules are \"exchange\" vessels whose ultra-thin walls allow the ready diffusion of molecules from the capillaries.\nThe return of blood to the heart is assisted by the action of the muscle pump, and by the thoracic pump action of breathing during respiration. Standing or sitting for a prolonged period of time can cause low venous return from venous pooling (vascular) shock. Fainting can occur but usually baroreceptors within the aortic sinuses initiate a baroreflex such that angiotensin II and norepinephrine stimulate vasoconstriction and heart rate increases to return blood flow. Neurogenic and hypovolaemic shock can also cause fainting. In these cases, the smooth muscles surrounding the veins become slack and the veins fill with the majority of the blood in the body, keeping blood away from the brain and causing unconsciousness. Jet pilots wear pressurized suits to help maintain their venous return and blood pressure.\nClinical significance.\nMost venous diseases involve obstruction such as a thrombus or insufficiency of the valves, or both of these. Other conditions may be due to inflammation, or compression. Ageing is a major independent risk factor for venous disorders. The medical speciality involved with the diagnosis and treatment of venous disorders is known as phlebology (also \"venology\"), and the specialist concerned is a phlebologist. There are a number of vascular surgeries and endovascular surgeries carried out by vascular surgeons to treat many venous diseases.\nVenous insufficiency.\nVenous insufficiency is the most common disorder of the venous system, and is usually manifested as either spider veins or varicose veins. Several treatments are available including endovenous thermal ablation (using radiofrequency or laser energy), vein stripping, ambulatory phlebectomy, foam sclerotherapy, laser, or compression.\nPostphlebitic syndrome is venous insufficiency that develops following deep vein thrombosis.\nVenous thrombosis.\nVenous thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus (blood clot) in a vein. This most commonly affects a deep vein known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but can also affect a superficial vein known as superficial vein thrombosis (SVT).\nDeep vein thrombosis.\nDVT usually occurs in the veins of the legs, although it can also occur in the deep veins of the arms. Immobility, active cancer, obesity, traumatic damage and congenital disorders that make clots more likely are all risk factors for deep vein thrombosis. It can cause the affected limb to swell, and cause pain and an overlying skin rash. In the worst case, a deep vein thrombosis can extend, or a part of a clot can break off as an embolus and lodge in a pulmonary artery in the lungs, known as a pulmonary embolism.\nThe decision to treat deep vein thrombosis depends on its size, symptoms, and their risk factors. It generally involves anticoagulation to prevents clots or to reduce the size of the clot. Intermittent pneumatic compression is a method used to improve venous circulation in cases of edema or in those at risk from a deep vein thrombosis.\nSuperficial vein thrombosis.\nSVT is the development of a thrombus in a superficial vein. SVT is not normally clinically significant, but the thrombus can migrate into the deep venous system where it can also give rise to a pulmonary embolism. The main risk factor for SVT in the lower limbs is varicose veins.\nPortal hypertension.\nThe portal vein also known as the \"hepatic portal vein\" carries blood drained from most of the gastrointestinal tract to the liver. Portal hypertension is mainly caused by cirrhosis of the liver. Other causes can include an obstructing clot in a hepatic vein (Budd Chiari syndrome) or compression from tumors or tuberculosis lesions. When the pressure increases in the portal vein, a collateral circulation develops, causing visible veins such as esophageal varices.\nPhlebitis.\nPhlebitis is the inflammation of a vein. It is usually accompanied by a blood clot when it is known as thrombophlebitis. When the affected vein is a superficial vein in the leg, it is known as superficial thrombophlebitis, and unlike deep vein thrombosis there is little risk of the clot breaking off as an embolus.\nCompression.\nSome disorders as syndromes result from compression of a vein. These include a venous type of thoracic outlet syndrome, due to compression of a subclavian vein; nutcracker syndrome most usually due to compression of the left renal vein, and May\u2013Thurner syndrome associated with compression of the iliac vein which can lead to iliofemoral DVT. Compression of the superior vena cava most usually by a malignant tumor can lead to superior vena cava syndrome.\nVascular anomalies.\nA vascular anomaly can be either a vascular tumor or a birthmark, or a vascular malformation.\n In a tumor such as infantile hemangioma the mass is soft, and easily compressed, and their coloring is due to the dilated anomalous involved veins. They are most commonly found in the head and neck. Venous malformations are the type of vascular malformation that involves the veins. They can often extend deeper from their surface appearance, reaching underlying muscle or bone. In the neck they may extend into the lining of the mouth cavity or into the salivary glands. They are the most common of the vascular malformations. A severe venous malformation can involve the lymph vessels as a \"lymphaticovenous malformation\".\nVenous access.\nVenous access is any method used to access the bloodstream through the veins, either to administer intravenous therapy such as medication, or fluid, parenteral nutrition, to obtain blood for analysis, or to provide an access point for blood-based treatments such as dialysis or apheresis. Access is most commonly achieved via the placement of a central venous catheter, a Seldinger technique, and guidance tools such as ultrasound and fluoroscopy can also be used to assist with access location.\nImaging.\nUltrasound, particularly duplex ultrasound, is the most usual and widely used way of viewing veins in the diagnosis of venous disease. Venography is an invasive procedure that uses a catheter to deliver a contrast agent in giving an X-ray of veins. An augmented reality healthcare application is a near-infrared vein finder that films subcutaneous veins, and projects their image either onto a screen or onto the person's skin.\nRecognition techniques.\nSome imaging techniques using veins have been developed for identification purposes. These vein matching technologies, include finger vein recognition, and eye vein verification.\nHistory.\nThe Greek physician Herophilus (born 335 BC) distinguished veins from arteries, noting the thicker walls of arteries, but thought that the pulse was a property of arteries themselves. Greek anatomist Erasistratus observed that arteries that were cut during life bleed. He ascribed the fact to the phenomenon that air escaping from an artery is replaced with blood that entered by very small vessels between veins and arteries. Thus he apparently postulated capillaries but with reversed flow of blood.\nIn 2nd century AD Rome, the Greek physician Galen knew that blood vessels carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Growth and energy were derived from venous blood created in the liver from chyle, while arterial blood gave vitality by containing pneuma (air) and originated in the heart. Blood flowed from both creating organs to all parts of the body where it was consumed and there was no return of blood to the heart or liver. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves.\nGalen believed that the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right by passing through 'pores' in the interventricular septum, air passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart. As the arterial blood was created 'sooty' vapors were created and passed to the lungs also via the pulmonary artery to be exhaled.\nIn addition, Ibn al-Nafis had an insight into what would become a larger theory of the capillary circulation. He stated that \"there must be small communications or pores (\"manafidh\" in Arabic) between the pulmonary artery and vein,\" a prediction that preceded the discovery of the capillary system by more than 400 years. Ibn al-Nafis' theory, however, was confined to blood transit in the lungs and did not extend to the entire body.\nFinally, William Harvey, a pupil of Hieronymus Fabricius (who had earlier described the valves of the veins without recognizing their function), performed a sequence of experiments, and published \"Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus\" in 1628, which \"demonstrated that there had to be a direct connection between the venous and arterial systems throughout the body, and not just the lungs. Most importantly, he argued that the beat of the heart produced a continuous circulation of blood through minute connections at the extremities of the body. This is a conceptual leap that was quite different from Ibn al-Nafis' refinement of the anatomy and bloodflow in the heart and lungs.\" This work, with its essentially correct exposition, slowly convinced the medical world. However, Harvey was not able to identify the capillary system connecting arteries and veins; these were later discovered by Marcello Malpighi in 1661.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The school is the largest boarding school in England, ahead of Millfield and Oundle.\nEton charges up to \u00a352,749 per year (\u00a317,583 per term, with three terms per academic year, for 2023/24). It was the sixth most expensive Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference boarding school in the UK in 2013\u201314.\nIt was founded in 1440 by Henry VI as \"Kynge's College of Our Ladye of Eton besyde Windesore\", making it the 18th-oldest school in the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC). Originally intended as a sister institution to King's College, Cambridge, Eton is known for its history, wealth, and notable alumni, known as . It has educated prime ministers, world leaders, Nobel laureates, Academy Award and BAFTA award-winning actors, and generations of the aristocracy, and has been referred to as \"the nurse of England's statesmen\".\nEton is one of four public schools, along with Harrow (1572), Radley (1847) and Sherborne, to have retained the boys-only, boarding-only tradition, which means that its boys live at the school seven days a week during term time. The remainder of them, including Charterhouse in 1971, Westminster in 1973, Rugby in 1976, Shrewsbury in 2015, and Winchester in 2022, have since become co-educational.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nEton College was founded by Henry VI as a charity school to provide free education to 70 poor boys who would then go on to King's College, Cambridge, founded by the same king in 1441. Henry used Winchester College as a model, visiting at least six times (in 1441, 1444, 1446, 1447, 1448, 1449, 1451, 1452) and having its statutes transcribed. Henry appointed Winchester's headmaster, William Waynflete, as Eton's Provost, and transferred some of Winchester's 70 scholars to start his new school.\nWhen Henry VI founded the school, he granted it a large number of endowments, including much valuable land. The group of feoffees appointed by the king to receive forfeited lands of the Alien Priories for the endowment of Eton were as follows:\nIt was intended to have formidable buildings; Henry intended the nave of the College Chapel to be the longest in Europe, and several religious relics, supposedly including a part of the True Cross and the Crown of Thorns. He persuaded the then Pope, Eugene IV, to grant him a privilege unparalleled anywhere in England: the right to grant indulgences to penitents on the Feast of the Assumption. The college also came into possession of one of England's Apocalypse manuscripts.\nHowever, when Henry was deposed by King Edward IV in 1461, the new King annulled all grants to the school and removed most of its assets and treasures to St George's Chapel, Windsor, on the other side of the River Thames. Legend has it that Edward's mistress, Jane Shore, intervened on the school's behalf. She was able to save a good part of the school, although the royal bequest and the number of staff were much reduced. Construction of the chapel, originally intended to be slightly over twice as long, with 18, or possibly 17, bays (there are eight today) was stopped when Henry VI was deposed. Only the Quire of the intended building was completed. Eton's first Head Master, William Waynflete, founder of Magdalen College, Oxford and previously headmaster of Winchester College, built the ante-chapel that completed the chapel. The important wall paintings in the chapel and the brick north range of the present School Yard also date from the 1480s; the lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, were built between 1441 and 1460.\nAs the school suffered reduced income while still under construction, the completion and further development of the school have since depended to some extent on wealthy benefactors. Building resumed when Roger Lupton was Provost, around 1517. His name is borne by the big gatehouse in the west range of the cloisters, fronting School Yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school. This range includes the important interiors of the Parlour, Election Hall, and Election Chamber, where most of the 18th century \"leaving portraits\" are kept.\n\"After Lupton's time, nothing important was built until about 1670, when Provost Allestree gave a range to close the west side of School Yard between Lower School and Chapel\". This was remodelled later and completed in 1694 by Matthew Bankes, Master Carpenter of the Royal Works. The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister, 1725\u201329, by Thomas Rowland. It has a very important collection of books and manuscripts.\n19th century onwards.\nThe Duke of Wellington is often incorrectly quoted as saying that \"The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton.\" Wellington was at Eton from 1781 to 1784 and was to send his sons there. According to Nevill (citing the historian Sir Edward Creasy), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, \"There grows the stuff that won Waterloo\", a remark Nevill construes as a reference to \"the manly character induced by games and sport\" among English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically. In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's \"C'est ici qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 gagn\u00e9e la bataille de Waterloo\" (\"It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won\").\nThe architect John Shaw Jr (1803\u20131870) became a surveyor to Eton. He designed New Buildings (1844\u201346), Provost Francis Hodgson's addition to provide better accommodation for collegers, who until then had mostly lived in Long Chamber, a long first-floor room where conditions were inhumane.\nFollowing complaints about the finances, buildings and management of Eton, the Clarendon Commission was set up in 1861 as a royal commission to investigate the state of nine schools in England, including Eton.\nQuestioned by the commission in 1862, Head Master Edward Balston came under attack for his view that in the classroom little time could be spared for subjects other than classical studies.\nAs with other public schools, a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiarise privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas. The project of establishing an \"Eton Mission\" in the crowded district of Hackney Wick in east London was started at the beginning of 1880, and it lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project (at Dorney) would be more realistic. However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by G. F. Bodley was erected; many Etonians visited and stimulated among other things the Eton Manor Boys' Club, a notable rowing club which has survived the Mission itself, and the 59 Club for motorcyclists.\nThe large and ornate School Hall and School Library (by L. K. Hall) were erected in 1906\u201308 across the road from Upper School as the school's memorial to the Etonians who had died in the Boer War. Many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead Etonians of the First World War.\nIn December 1940, during the height of the Blitz, a bomb fell on the College grounds, destroying part of the Upper School and blowing out the stained glass windows of the Chapel. In 1949 the College commissioned modernist replacement windows from Irish stained glass artist Evie Hone. The large Crucifixion window in the east wall was installed according to her design in 1952. However, Hone's death the following year prevented her from completing the Chapel's entire reglazing scheme. In 1959 the commission for the eight windows of the nave passed instead to artist John Piper, whose designs were realised in glass by his regular collaborator, the glassmaker Patrick Reyntiens, over the next five years. Intended to be in dialogue with Hone's east window, the four windows to the north each depict one of the Miracles of Jesus - the Miraculous Draft of Fishes, the Feeding of the Five Thousand, the Stilling of the Waters, and the Raising of Lazarus. To the south four Parables of Jesus are shown - the Light under a Bushel, the House built on Rock, the Lost Sheep, and the Sower.\nAmong Head Masters of the late 19th and 20th centuries were Cyril Alington, Robert Birley and Anthony Chenevix-Trench. M. R. James was a Provost. Between 1926 and 1939, Eton pupils were included as part of a group of around 20 or 30 selected public school boys who travelled yearly to various British Empire countries as part of the Public School Boys Empire Tour. The first tour travelled to Australia; the last went to Canada. The purpose of the tours was to encourage Empire settlement, with the boys possibly becoming district officers in India or imperial governors of the Dominions.\nIn 1959, the college constructed a nuclear bunker to house the college's Provost and fellows. The facility is now used for storage. In 1969, Dillibe Onyeama became the first black person to obtain his school-leaving certificate from Eton. Three years later Onyeama was banned from visiting Eton after he published a book which described the racism that he experienced during his time at the school. Simon Henderson, current Head Master of Eton, apologised to Onyeama for the treatment he endured during his time at the school, although Onyeama did not think the apology was necessary.\nIn 2005, the school was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools found to have breached the Competition Act 1998 (see Eton College controversies). In 2011, plans to attack Eton College were found on the body of a senior al-Qaeda leader shot dead in Somalia.\nOverview.\nCoat of arms.\nThe coat of arms of Eton College was granted in 1449 by the founder King Henry VI, as recorded as follows on the original charter, attested by the Great Seal of England and preserved in the College archives:\n\"On a field sable three lily-flowers argent, intending that Our newly founded College, lasting for ages to come, whose perpetuity We wish to be signified by the stability of the sable colour, shall bring forth the brightest flowers redolent of every kind of knowledge; to which also, that We may impart something of royal nobility which may declare the work truly royal and illustrious, We have resolved that that portion of the arms which by royal right belong to Us in the Kingdoms of France and England be placed on the chief of the shield, per pale azure with a flower of the French, and gules with a leopard passant or\".\nThus the blazon is: \"Sable, three lily-flowers argent on a chief per pale azure and gules in the dexter a fleur-de-lys in the sinister a lion passant guardant or\". The three lilies are also evident on the coat-of-arms of Eton provost Roger Lupton. Although the charter specifies that the lily flowers relate to the founder's hope for a flourishing of knowledge, that flower is also a symbol for the Virgin Mary, in whose honour the college was founded, with the number of three having significance to the Blessed Trinity. The motto of the college is \"Floreat Etona\" (\"may Eton flourish\"). The grant of arms to King's College, Cambridge, is worded identically, but with roses instead of lily-flowers.\nGovernance and management.\nThe school is headed by a Provost, a vice-provost and a board of governors (known as Fellows) who appoint the Head Master. As of 2022[ [update]] the school governors include:\nStatute VII of the College provides that the board shall be populated as follows (in addition to the Provost and Vice-Provost):\nThe current Provost, William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill, has made public that he will be stepping down as Provost after the 2024 Summer Half (summer term).\nHouses.\nThe school contains 25 boys' houses, each headed by a housemaster, selected from the more senior members of the teaching staff, which numbers some 155. Almost all of the school's pupils go on to universities, about a third of them to the University of Oxford or University of Cambridge.\nKing's Scholars.\nOne boarding house, \"College\", is reserved for 70 King's Scholars, who attend Eton on scholarships provided by the original foundation and awarded by excelling in an examination prior to entry. Today, the scholarship is only by name and no financial incentive is automatically provided. Still, up to a third receive some kind of bursary or scholarship. The name 'King's Scholars' refers to the foundation of the school by King Henry VI in 1440. The original school consisted of the 70 Scholars (together with some Commensals) and the Scholars were educated and boarded at the foundation's expense.\nKing's Scholars are entitled to use the letters 'KS' after their name and they can be identified by a black gown worn over the top of their tailcoats, giving them the nickname 'tugs' (Latin: \"togati\", wearers of gowns); and by a surplice in Chapel. The house is looked after by the Master in College. They include many of the most academically gifted boys in the school.\nOppidans.\nAs the school grew, more pupils were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in boarding-houses within the town of Eton, outside the college's original buildings. These pupils became known as Oppidans, from the Latin word \"oppidum\", meaning \"town\". The houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the 18th and 19th centuries the housemasters started to rely more for administrative purposes on a senior female member of staff, known as a \"dame\", who became responsible for the physical welfare of the boys. (Some houses had previously been run by dames without a housemaster.) Each house typically contains about 50 boys. Although classes are organised on a school basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their house.\nNot all boys who pass the college election examination choose to become King's Scholars, which involves living in \"College\" with its own ancient traditions, wearing a gown, and therefore a degree of separation from the other boys. If they choose instead to belong to one of the 24 Oppidan houses, they are simply regarded as Oppidans. However, they may still earn a non-financial award that recognises their academic capabilities. This is known as an Oppidan Scholarship. The title of Oppidan Scholar is awarded for consistently performing with distinction in school and external examinations (\"Trials\"): to earn the title, a boy must obtain either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his school career. Within the school, an Oppidan Scholar is entitled to use the post-nominal letters \"OS\". Historically, the title \"Oppidan Scholar\" was awarded to boys who were successful in the Foundation Scholarship election examination but had chosen not to take that scholarship up. Later, the title was also awarded to some boys who had achieved academic distinction during their school career. Since 2018, Oppidan Scholarships have not been awarded on entry on the basis of the Foundation Scholarship examination. The title \"Oppidan Scholar\" is currently only awarded based upon achieving a \"Distinction\" (the top class) in a certain number of \"Trials\" (the internal examinations held twice a year), or an equivalent performance in external examinations. A boy will be considered for the title after receiving four Distinctions (or three consecutively).\nEach Oppidan house is usually referred to by the initials (forenames and surname) of its current housemaster, a senior teacher (\"beak\"), or more formally by his surname alone, not by the name of the building in which it is situated. Houses occasionally swap buildings according to the seniority of the housemaster and the physical desirability of the building. The names of buildings occupied by houses are used for few purposes other than a correspondence address. They are: Godolphin House, Jourdelay's (both built as such c. 1720), Hawtrey House, Durnford House (the first two built as such by the Provost and Fellows, 1845, when the school was increasing in numbers and needed more centralised control), The Hopgarden, South Lawn, Waynflete, Evans's, Keate House, Warre House, Villiers House, Common Lane House, Penn House, Walpole House, Cotton Hall, Wotton House, Holland House, Mustians, Angelo's, Manor House, Farrer House, Baldwin's Bec, The Timbralls, and Westbury.\nHouse structure.\nIn addition to the housemaster, each house has two house captains, two house captains of games and a house captain of arts. All house positions are entitled to \"Stick-Ups\" (a white bow tie and winged collar). Some houses may have more house captains than the standard rule. House prefects were once elected from the oldest year, but this no longer happens. The old term \"Library\" survives in the name of the room set aside for the oldest year's use, where boys have their own kitchen and living space. Similarly, boys in their penultimate year have a room known as \"Debate\".\nThere are entire house gatherings every evening, usually around 8:05\u20138:30\u00a0p.m. These are known as \"Prayers\", due to their original nature. The house master and boys have an opportunity to make announcements, and sometimes the boys provide light entertainment. For much of Eton's history, junior boys had to act as \"fags\", or servants, to older boys. Their duties included cleaning, cooking, and running errands. A Library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice, \"Boy, Up!\" or \"Boy, Queue!\", and all first-year boys had to come running. The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as fagging, were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s. Captains of house and games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from the school office.\nThere are many inter-house competitions, mostly in sports but also in academics, drama and music.\nHeadmasters.\nThe Head Master is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the school is a member of the Eton Group of independent schools in the United Kingdom.\nThe school appointed its first female Lower Master (deputy head), Susan Wijeratna, in 2017. She was succeeded by Paul Williams in 2023 as she took on the role of headmistress at Latymer Upper School.\nFormer pupils.\nEton has a long list of distinguished former pupils. In 2019, Boris Johnson became the 20th British prime minister to have attended the school, and the fifth since the end of the Second World War. Previous Conservative leader David Cameron was the 19th British prime minister to have attended the school, and recommended that Eton set up a school in the state sector to help drive up standards.\nReputation.\nEton has been described as the most famous public school in the world, and has been referred to as \"the chief nurse of England's statesmen\". Eton has educated generations of British and foreign aristocracy, and for the first time, members of the British royal family in direct line of succession: the Prince of Wales and his brother the Duke of Sussex, in contrast to the royal tradition of male education at either naval college or Gordonstoun, or by tutors.\nThe \"Good Schools Guide\" called the school \"the number one boys' public school\", adding that \"The teaching and facilities are second to none.\" The school is a member of the G30 Schools Group. Eton today is a larger school than it has been for much of its history. In 1678, there were 207 boys. In the late 18th century, there were about 300, while today, the total has risen to over 1,300.\nThe school is included in The Schools Index as one of the 150 best private schools in the world and among top 30 senior schools in the UK. In September 2025 Eton was shortlisted for the 2026 'Tatler Schools Guide', along with Caterham, Brighton, Canford and Gresham's, as one of the five best public schools in the country.\nFinancial support.\nAbout 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships. A recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton was developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents' income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received \"significant\" financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge. Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils receiving financial assistance would continue to increase. The Orwell Award is a sixth form scholarship awarded to boys in UK state schools whose academic performance may have been held back by personal circumstance. Boys who earn this award attend the school on a 100% bursary.\nGrounds.\nThe grounds of Eton College are a registered historic park and garden of about 18 hectares on the north bank of the River Thames. The grounds combine medieval courts, formal gardens and playing fields and have been integral to the college since its foundation. By the late seventeenth century, two principal gardens had been laid out north of the main buildings: the Provost's Garden and what is now the Head Master's Garden. These were later joined by the Fellows' (now Vice-Provost's) Garden and Luxmoore's Garden on an island in the Thames. The Provost's Garden includes the sunken King of Siam's Garden, created in 1929 in honour of King Prajadhipok (Rama VII), an Old Etonian who funded the redevelopment of the former stable yard. The rectangular terrace features mixed borders and provides the setting for the \"Novi Fundatores\" wall commemorating major benefactors of the college. The Fellows' Garden, raised above surrounding parkland and enclosed by walls, is planted with specimen trees such as London plane and cedar and offers views towards the chapel and Windsor Castle. The King of Siam's Garden, the Fellows' Garden and other areas were replanted in the early twenty-first century by garden designer James Alexander-Sinclair.\nLuxmoore's Garden occupies an island in the Thames to the south-east of the college buildings and features informal lawns, shrubberies, specimen trees and a late-Victorian summerhouse. The gardens are private but are regularly opened to the public through the National Garden Scheme.\nChanges to the school.\nRegistration at birth, corporal punishment, and fagging are no longer practised at Eton. Academic standards were raised, and by the mid-1990s Eton ranked among Britain's top three schools in getting its pupils into Oxford and Cambridge.\nThe proportion of boys at the school who were sons of Old Etonians fell from 60% in 1960 to 20% in 2016. This has been attributed to a number of factors, including: the dissolution of the house lists, which allowed Old Etonians to register their sons at birth, in 1990; harder entrance examinations as the emphasis on academic attainment increased; a sharp rise in school fees increasingly beyond the means of many UK families; and increased applications from international, often very wealthy, families.\nSchool terms.\nThere are three academic terms (known as halves) in the year:\nThey are called halves because the school year was once split into two halves, between which the boys went home.\nSchool life.\nUniform.\nThe school is known for its traditions, including a uniform of black tailcoat (or morning coat) and black waistcoat, a starched stiff collar and black pinstriped trousers. Most pupils wear a white \"tie\" which is a narrow strip of cloth folded over the joint of the collar to hide the collar stud, but some senior boys are entitled to wear a white bow tie and winged collar (\"Stick-Ups\"). These include boys part of select prefect bodies, those who represent their house as a type of House Captain (general, sports or arts) and those who are \"keepers\" of areas of the school. There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority; see School Prefects and King's Scholars sections.\nThe long-standing belief that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of King George III in 1820 is unfounded. In 1862, Edward Balston, Head Master, noted little in the way of uniform in an interview with the Clarendon Commission.\nLord Clarendon: One more question, which bears in some degree upon other schools, namely with regard to the dress. The boys do not wear any particular dress at Eton?\nEdward Balston: No, with the exception that they are obliged to wear a white neckcloth.\nLord Clarendon: Is the colour of their clothes much restricted?\nEdward Balston: We would not let them wear for instance a yellow coat or any other colour very much out of the way.\nLord Clarendon: If they do not adopt anything very extravagant either with respect to colour or cut you allow them to follow their own taste with respect to the choice of their clothes?\nEdward Balston: Yes.\nLord Lyttelton: They must wear the common round hat?\nEdward Balston: Yes.\nThe uniform worn today was gradually adopted and standardised towards the end of the nineteenth century. Until 1967, boys under the height of wore a cropped jacket (known as an Eton jacket, mess jacket, or \"bum-freezer\") instead of a tailcoat.\nTutors and teaching.\nTeachers are known officially as \"Masters\" but may also be referred to unofficially as \"beaks\". The pupil to teacher ratio is 8:1, which is extremely low by typical UK school standards. Class sizes start at around twenty to twenty-five in the first year and are often below ten by the final year.\nThe original curriculum concentrated on prayers, Latin and devotion, and \"as late as 1530 no Greek was taught\". Later the emphasis was on classical studies, dominated by Latin and Ancient History, and, for boys with sufficient ability, Classical Greek. From the latter part of the 19th century this curriculum has changed and broadened: for example, there are now more than 100 students of Chinese, which is a non-curriculum course. In the 1970s, there was just one school computer, in a small room attached to the science buildings. It used punched tape to store programmes. Today, all boys must have laptop computers and are given iPads for their school work, and the school fibre-optic network connects all classrooms and all boys' bedrooms to the internet.\nThe primary responsibility for a boy's studies lies with his House Master, but he is assisted by an additional director of studies, known as a tutor. Classes, formally known as \"divisions\" (\"divs\") or \"schools\", are organised on a school basis; the classrooms are separate from the houses. New blocks of classrooms have appeared approximately every decade since the construction of New (mathematics) Schools, designed by Henry Woodyer and built 1861\u201363. Despite the introduction of modern technology, the external appearance and locations of many of the classrooms have remained unchanged for a long time. The oldest classroom still in use, \"Lower School\", dates from the 15th century, though this is now used more for religious services and as a detention centre.\nEvery evening, about 75 minutes, known as Quiet Hour, is set aside, during which boys are expected to study or prepare work for their teachers if not otherwise engaged. Specialists (boys in sixth form) are not obliged to observe Quiet Hours but must still remain quiet and respectful during the allocated time. Some Houses, at the discretion of the House Master, may observe a second Quiet Hour after prayers in the evening. This is less formal, with boys being allowed to visit each other's rooms to socialise if neither boy has work outstanding. The Independent Schools Inspectorate's report for 2016 says, \"The achievement of pupils is exceptional. Progress and abilities of all pupils are at a high level. Pupils are highly successful in public examinations, and the record of entrance to universities with demanding entry requirements in the United Kingdom and overseas is strong.\"\nIn 2017, a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) schools skills ranking table, designed to show employability, showed the school performed disproportionally badly, falling to 109th place and behind many state schools. Edwina Dunn, the chairwoman of the company producing the report, called for schools to be reassessed based on how suitable pupils are for businesses in the post-Brexit world.\nSchool publications.\n\"The Chronicle\" is the official school magazine, having been founded in 1863. It is edited by boys at the school. Although liable to censorship, it has a tradition of satirising and attacking school policies, as well as documenting recent events. \"The Oppidan\", founded in 1828, was published once a half; it covered all sport in Eton and some professional events as well, but ceased to exist until a recent revival in 2023. \"The Junior Chronicle\" is the official school magazine of Lower Boys (pupils in their first two years at Eton) and it is written, edited and designed solely by them. In 2022, the Press Office became known as the Eton College Journalism Association. A totally boy-run team, headed by a Master, now runs the publication which reports on notable events across school life and societies, serving as an important summary of all that happens within the school.\nOther school magazines, including \"The Academic Yearbook\", \"The Arts Review\", and \"The Eton Zeitgeist\" have been published, as well as publications produced by individual departments such as \"The 1440 Review\" (history), \"The Agathon\" (philosophy), \"The Axiom\" (mathematics), \"Scientific Etonian\" (science), \"The Ampersand\" (English), \"Biopsy\" (medicine), \"The Lexicon\" (modern languages) and \"The Etonal\" (music). Online publications also include \"EtonSTEM\" (STEM subjects) and \"The Florentina\" (environmental).\nSocieties.\nAt Eton, there are many organisations known as 'societies', in many of which pupils come together to discuss a particular topic or to listen to a lecture, presided over by a senior pupil, and often including a guest speaker. As of September 2024, there are 80 clubs, activities and societies in existence, catering for a wide range of interests and largely run by boys.\nGrants and admissions.\nPrizes are awarded on the results of trials (internal exams), GCSE and AS-levels. In addition, many subjects and activities have specially endowed prizes, several of which are awarded by visiting experts. The most prestigious of these is the Newcastle Scholarship. The Newcastle Scholarship is awarded on the strength of an examination, consisting of two papers in philosophical theology, moral theory and applied ethics. The Keynes Prize is awarded on an examination of a particular topic within the branch of Economics.\nThe Rosebery Prize for History is awarded on the same day as the Newcastle Scholarship, and follows a similar format of a three-hour exam during the Lent Half (although the Newcastle Scholarship is awarded on the basis of two such examinations). Also of note is the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Coutts Prize, awarded on the results of trials and AS-level examinations in C block (Year 12); and the Huxley Prize, awarded for a project on a scientific subject. Other specialist prizes include the Newcastle Classical Prize (which was formerly the same prize as the Newcastle Scholarship, but the two were separated as a decreasing number of philosophers were fluent in Latin and Classical Greek); the Queen's Prizes for French and German; the Duke of Newcastle's Russian Prize; the Beddington Spanish Prize; the Strafford and Bowman Shakespeare Prizes; the Tomline and Russell Prizes for Mathematics; the Robert Bridges Prize for English; the Sotheby Prize for History of Art; the Waddington Prize for Theology and Philosophy; the Birley Prize for History; the Rorie Mackenzie Prize for Modern Languages; the Robert Boyle Prize for Physics; the Macmillan Prize for Politics; the Wilder Prize for Theology and the Hervey Verse Prize for poetry in senior years.\nPrizes are awarded too for excellence in activities outside of academics. The Loder Declamation Prize is one of the oldest prizes and the most prestigious non-academic prize in the school where boys are required to read a bible passage, a monologue from a Shakespeare play, and a set of prose. Other non-academic prizes are awarded for activities such as painting, sculpture, ceramics, playing musical instruments, musical composition, acting, backstage work, classical and modern language declamation, silverwork, and design.\nVarious benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad. These include the Busk Fund, which supports individual ventures that show particular initiative; the C. M. Wells Memorial Trust Fund, for the promotion of visits to classical lands; the Sadler Fund, which supports, among others, those intending to enter the Foreign Service; and the Marsden Fund, for travel in countries where the principal language is not English.\nIncentives and sanctions.\nEton has a well-established system for encouraging boys to produce high-standard work. An excellent piece of work may be rewarded with a \"Show Up\", to be shown to the boy's tutors as evidence of progress. If, in any particular term, a pupil makes a particularly good effort in any subject, he may be \"Commended for Good Effort\" to the Head Master (or Lower Master). If any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be \"Sent Up For Good\", storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity. This award has been around since the 18th century. As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton's boys. First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department. Upon receiving approval from the Head of Department, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the pupil will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.\nThe opposite of a Show Up is a \"Rip\". This is for sub-standard work, which is sometimes torn at the top of the page/sheet and must be submitted to the boy's housemaster for signature. Boys who accumulate rips are liable to be given a \"White Ticket\", a form of a progress report which must be signed at intervals by all his teachers and may be accompanied by other punishments, usually involving doing domestic chores or writing lines. In recent times, a milder form of the rip, 'sign for information', colloquially known as an \"info\", has been introduced, which must also be signed by the boy's housemaster and tutor. Internal examinations are held at the end of the Michaelmas half (i.e. autumn term) for all pupils except those in the last year, and in the Summer half for those in the first, second and fourth years (i.e. those not taking a full set of public examinations). These internal examinations are called \"Trials\". Boys who fail to achieve a certain mark in a subject in a set of trials are 'flagged', and sometimes asked to revise that subject over the coming holidays to then re-sit the exam at the beginning of the next half.\nA boy who is late for any division or other appointments may be required to sign \"Tardy Book\", a register kept in the School Office, between 7:35 am and 7:45 am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days). Tardy Book may also be issued for late work. For more serious misdeeds, a boy is placed \"on the Bill\", which involves him being summoned by the sudden entry of a prefect (Sixth Form Select) into one of his divisions, who announces in a loud and formal tone that at a given time a certain pupil must attend the office of the Head Master, or Lower Master if the boy is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds. In such cases the pupil would ordinarily receive a detention of either one or two hours in length, however it is possible for no punishment to be given if a sufficient explanation is provided. The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, suspension, or rustication (a form of suspension which doesn't go on one's disciplinary record) or in former times, beating. Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils may claim it as a \"run\" and absent themselves for the rest of its duration, provided they report their intention so to do at the School Office.\nA traditional punishment took the form of being made to copy, by hand, Latin hexameters. Offenders were frequently set 100 hexameters by Library members, or, for more serious offences, Georgics (more than 500 hexameters) by their House Masters or the Head Master. The giving of a Georgic is now extremely rare, but still occasionally occurs.\nCorporal punishment.\nEton used to be renowned for its use of corporal punishment, generally known as \"beating\". In the 16th century, Friday was set aside as \"flogging day\". A special wooden birching block was used for the purpose, with the boy being directed to fetch it and then kneel over it. John Keate, Head Master from 1809 to 1834, took over at a time when discipline was poor. Until 1964, offending boys could be summoned to the Head Master or the Lower Master, as appropriate, to receive a birching on the bare posterior, in a semi-public ceremony held in the Library, where there was a special wooden birching block over which the offender was held. Anthony Chenevix-Trench, Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with caning, also applied to the bare buttocks, which he administered privately in his office.\nChenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys. Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane offenders over the seat of the trousers. This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table. Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see Eton Society below) in the form of a \"Pop-Tanning\", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke). The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds. This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.\nChenevix-Trench's successor from 1970, Michael McCrum, retained private corporal punishment by masters but ended the practice of requiring boys to take their trousers and underpants down when bending over to be caned by the Head Master. By the mid-1970s, the only people allowed to administer caning were the Head Master and the Lower Master.\nCorporal punishment was phased out in the 1980s. The film director Sebastian Doggart claims to have been the last boy caned at Eton, in 1984.\nPrefects.\nIn addition to the masters, the following three categories of senior boys are entitled to exercise school discipline. Boys who belong to any of these categories, in addition to a limited number of other boy office holders, are entitled to wear winged collars with bow ties (known as \"Stick-Ups\").\nOver the years its power and privileges have grown. Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton, created in 1811 by Charles Fox Townshend. The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters. Now, it involves a complex process where all boys in C Block, all teachers, Housemasters, Dames, and the current Pop vote for who they think are the best candidates. The Lower Master then compiles all this information and holds a final meeting called the 'Pop Committee', where all members are decided upon, including which of these members are to be chosen as the President of Pop, Chairman of Pop, Captain of the School and Captain of the Oppidans. Members of Pop wear a braided tailcoat (buttonhole), white and black houndstooth-checked trousers, a starched stick-up collar and a white bow-tie, and are entitled to wear flamboyant waistcoats, often of their own design.\nHistorically, only members of Pop were entitled to furl their umbrellas or sit on the wall on the Long Walk, in front of the main building. However, these traditions have died out. They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including school plays, parents' evenings and other official events, and generally maintain order. Notable ex-members of Pop include the Prince of Wales (unlike his younger brother the Duke of Sussex, who failed to be elected), Hugh Laurie, Eddie Redmayne, Arthur Hallam, William Ewart Gladstone, Stafford Northcote, Lord Rosebery and Tom Hiddleston. The former Provost Lord Waldegrave was both the President of Pop and Captain of the Oppidans.\nThe number of Sixth Form Select has grown over time. Members of Sixth Form Select are entitled to wear silver buttons on their waistcoats. They also act as Praepostors: they enter classrooms in mid-lesson without knocking and ask in a loud and formal tone, \"Is (family name) in this division?\" followed by \"He is to see the Head Master at (time) on the bill\" (the \"Bill\", see above). Members of Sixth Form Select also perform \"Speeches\", a formal event held five times a year, most notably on Fourth of June. The names of members of Sixth Form Select are engraved in the Head Master's Schoolroom.\nThe position of the Head Boys of Eton is divided into four roles: President of Pop, Chairman of Pop, Captain of the School and Captain of the Oppidans. The first two are the leaders of Pop and the latter two are the leaders of Sixth Form Select. Captain of the School and Captain of the Oppidans are also in Pop and in the Monarch (rowing prefect body) \"ex officio\".\nIn the era of Queen Elizabeth I, there were two praepostors in every form, who noted down the names of absentees. Until the late 19th century, there was a praepostor for every division of the school.\nExtra\u2013curricular activities.\nSports.\nSport is a feature of Eton; which has nearly 200 acres of playing fields and amenity land. The names of the playing fields include Agar's Plough, Dutchman's, Upper Club, Lower Club, Sixpenny/The Field, and Mesopotamia (situated between two streams and often shortened to \"Mespots\").\nThe rowing lake at Dorney was developed and is owned by the college. It was the venue for the rowing and canoeing events at the 2012 Summer Olympics and the World Junior Rowing Championships. The annual cricket match against Harrow at Lord's Cricket Ground is the oldest fixture of the cricketing calendar, having been played there since 1805. A staple of the London society calendar since the 1800s, in 1914, its importance was such that over 38,000 people attended the two days' play, and in 1910 the match made national headlines but interest has since declined considerably, and the match is now a one-day limited overs contest. In the 2024 match, Harrow were the victors.\nIn 1815, Eton College documented its football rules, the first football code to be written down anywhere in the world. Eton Match was the annual cricket match between Eton and Winchester held at each school alternately. First played in 1826, it was originally just the cricket match, held over two days, with a dinner or concert or dance on one of the evenings. Eton Match, as such, ceased to exist by 2001.\nThere is a running track at the Thames Valley Athletics Centre and an annual steeplechase. The running track was controversial as it was purchased with a \u00a33m National Lottery grant with the school getting full daytime use of the facilities in exchange for \u00a3200k and of land. The bursar claimed that Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic club was \"deprived\" because it did not have a world-class running track and facilities for training and the Sports Council agreed, saying the whole community would benefit. However Steve Osborn, director of the Safe Neighbourhoods Unit, described the decision as \"staggering\" given substantial reduction in youth services by councils across the country. The facility which became the Thames Valley Athletics Centre opened in April 1999.\nEton's Shooting VIII competed in the Ashburton Shield for many decades against the other major public schools. In July 1935, the \"Public School Rivalry\" was reported thus: \"Charterhouse, Harrow, Winchester, Eton, Rugby and Clifton, all previous winners, were determined to add to their laurels\" in the competition. Eton reportedly drew with Charterhouse and beat Clifton in the July 1939 competition held at Bisley. As with the other schools, Eton's cadet corps sent a team of eight men \u2013 the Shooting VIII \u2013 to compete annually at Bisley.\nAmong the other sports played at Eton is Eton Fives.\nOlympic rowing.\nIn 2006, six years before the 2012 London Summer Olympics and London 2012 Summer Paralympic Games, Eton completed the construction of Dorney Lake, a permanent, eight-lane, 2,200 metre course (about 1.4 miles) in a 400-acre park. Eton financed the construction from its own funds. Officially known throughout the Games as \"Eton Dorney\", Dorney Lake provided training facilities for Olympic and Paralympic competitors, and during the Games, hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Rowing competitions as well as the Olympic Canoe Sprint event. It attracted over 400,000 visitors during the Games period (around 30,000 per day), and was voted the best 2012 Olympic venue by spectators. Thirty medal events were held on Dorney Lake, during which Team GB won a total of 12 medals, making the lake one of the most successful venues for Team GB. The FISA President, Denis Oswald, described it as \"the best-ever Olympic rowing venue\". In June 2013, it hosted the World Rowing Cup. Access to the parkland around the Lake is provided to members of the public, free of charge, almost all the year round.\nMusic.\nThe current \"Precentor\" (Director of Music) is Tim Johnson, who took over from Ralph Allwood in September 2011. The school has eight organs and an entire building for music (performance spaces include two concert venues: the Parry Hall and the Concert Hall). The Salata Auditorium (School Hall) is the largest concert venue in the school, seating about 700 people. The College Chapel and Lower Chapel also act as a centre of choral music.\nThe school has a variety of musical groups, including two chapel choirs, a symphony and chamber orchestra, jazz bands, a marching band, a pipe band, a gospel choir, a pop choir, two a cappella groups and numerous rock bands who regularly perform at open gig nights and more. Music production and technology, as well as musical theatre, have also grown in popularity in recent years. The College Chapel Choir (the main choir of the school) perform three times a week in regular services in College Chapel on top of a rigorous rehearsal schedule. They often perform at other large events such as at St. Andrew's Day, the \"Fourth of June\", Ascension Day, the Carol Service, Remembrance Day, and joint evensongs with other chapel choirs, such as those of Winchester College and St. George's Chapel. The Symphony Orchestra performs at the end of every term in a large School Concert, which always includes a piece featuring a large solo number performed by a boy. The Summer term School Concert also consists of the \"Vale\", the Eton Boating Song, which is sung by the most esteemed singers in B Block as they prepare to leave the school. Both the choir (and its complementary boy-run a cappella group, the \"Incognitos\") and the orchestra regularly tour internationally to countries such as France, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Latvia, the USA and Hong Kong. Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones such as the didgeridoo.\nThe school participates in many national competitions; many pupils are part of the National Youth Orchestra and National Youth Choir. The school gives scholarships and exhibitions for dedicated and talented musicians, as well as honorary exhibitions for boys who have proven their musical ability throughout their time at Eton, though these provide no financial benefit directly. Those with a scholarship or exhibition are entitled to have the post-nominal letters \"MS\" or \"ME\" depending on what form of award they have. Every year a choral scholarship is also awarded to someone who has proven exceptional choral and singing abilities, but then not in other fields of music. Recipients of this award have typically been choristers at top collegiate and cathedral choirs across the country, such as those of Westminster Cathedral and St. Paul's Cathedral. Many boys go on to continue singing in choirs as choral scholars or playing the organ as organ scholars at Oxford and Cambridge. Former Precentor Ralph Allwood set up and organised Eton Choral Courses, now the Rodolfus Foundation, which run at the school, as well as at Oxford and Cambridge amongst other venues, every summer.\nEvery two year, Eton employs a 'Composer-in-Residence', an external professional composer on a two-year contract who normally commissions new music for the main choir, as well as teaching Music GCSE and A Level to most year groups. In 2009, the school's musical prot\u00e9g\u00e9s came to wider notice when featured in a TV documentary \"A Boy Called Alex\". The film followed an Etonian, Alex Stobbs, a musician with cystic fibrosis, as he worked toward conducting the difficult \"Magnificat\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. Other notable musical prodigies at the school include piano prodigy Ryan Wang who joined the school in September 2020, now under the guidance of Ms. Jennie-Helen Moston. The school has produced many famous musicians in its history, including Hubert Parry, the writer of the hymn \"Jerusalem\" and the coronation anthem \"I was glad\".\nDrama.\nNumerous plays are put on every year at Eton College; there is one main theatre, called the Farrer (seating 400) and 2 Studio theatres, called the Caccia Studio and Empty Space (seating 90 and 80 respectively). There are about 8 or 9 house productions each year, around 3 or 4 \"independent\" plays (plays produced, directed and funded by boys) and three school plays, one specifically for boys in the first two years, and two open to all years. The school plays have such good reputations that they are normally fully booked every night.\nIn recent years, the school has put on a musical version of \"The Bacchae\" (October 2009) as well as productions of \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" (May 2010), \"The Cherry Orchard\" (February 2011), \"Joseph K\" (October 2011), \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (May 2012), \"Macbeth\" (October 2012), \"London Assurance\" (May 2013), \"Jerusalem\" (October 2013), \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (May 2014), \"Antigone\" (October 2015), \"The Government Inspector\" (May 2016), \"Romeo and Juliet\" (May 2017), \"Beaux Stratagem\" (October 2021), \"Vernon God Little\" (May 2022), \"Equus\" (October 2022), \"Ink\" (May 2023), \"After Life\" (May 2024) and \"Jack Absolute Flies Again\" (October 2024). On top of this, the school also holds a fringe-style School Play Festival every few years, where pupils and teachers write, direct and act in their own plays, hosted over the period of a week. The most recent one was held in October 2023, which hosted a wide variety of plays, from a comedy sketch, to a double bill of a musical and Eton's first dance performance.\nPreviously, the school used to cast girls in female roles from neighbouring schools, but more recently, these roles have been taken up by versatile actors at the school. Boys from the school are also responsible for the lighting, sound, stage management, costume and set design, and makeup of all the productions, under the guidance of several professional full-time theatre staff.\nEvery year, Eton employs a 'Director-in-Residence', an external professional director on a one-year contract who normally directs one house play and the Lower Boy play (a school play open solely to the first two-year groups), as well as teaching Drama and Theatre Studies to most year groups.\nThe drama department is headed by Rebecca Farley and several other teachers; Simon Dormandy was on the staff until late 2012. The school offers GCSE drama and A Level Theatre Studies.\nThe school has produced many actors such as Dominic West, Tom Hiddleston, Eddie Redmayne, Damian Lewis, and Hugh Laurie.\nCelebrations.\nEton's best-known holiday takes place on the so-called \"Fourth of June\", a celebration of the birthday of George III, Eton's greatest patron. This day is celebrated with the Procession of Boats, in which the top rowing crews from the top four years row past in vintage wooden rowing boats. After a normal chapel service, boys may attend a series of musical concerts, film screenings, sports displays, and \"Speeches\" performed by Sixth Form Select, before they gather on Agar's Plough for lunch in stalls. The 'Five Point' challenge is a tradition attempted by many boys the night before the \"Fourth of June\", where boys have to try and sneak out of their boarding house at night without being caught by their Housemaster or the security guards on patrol. The aim is to visit five notable points across and take photos there; some of these 'points' include the athletic centre, the roof of Bekynton (the school canteen), Windsor Bridge, and even the statue of King Henry VI in School Yard. Similar to the King's Official Birthday, the \"Fourth of June\" is no longer celebrated on 4 June, but on the Saturday before the start of the Summer term set of trials. Eton also observes St. Andrew's Day, on which the Eton wall game is played.\nCharitable status and fees.\nUntil 18 December 2010, Eton College was an \"exempt charity\" under English law (Charities Act 1993, Schedule 2). Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an \"excepted charity\", and fully registered with the Charities Commission, and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the UK. As a charity, it benefits from substantial tax breaks. It was calculated by David Jewell, former Master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the school about \u00a31,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the school. This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as \"assisted places\") to independent schools. However, no child attended Eton on this scheme, meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the school has always been lower. Eton's former Head Master, Tony Little, has claimed that the benefits that Eton provides to the local community free of charge (use of its facilities, etc.) have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status. The fee for the academic year 2023\u20132024 was \u00a352,749 (approximately US$67,000 or \u20ac62,000 as of November 2021), although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In sciences and academic disciplines, discovery is the observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and involves providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations, using knowledge previously acquired through abstract thought and from everyday experiences. \nSome discoveries represent a radical breakthrough in knowledge or technology. Others are based on earlier discoveries, collaborations or ideas. In such cases, the process of discovery requires at least the awareness that an existing concept or method could be modified or transformed. New discoveries are made using various senses, and are usually added to pre-existing knowledge. Questioning plays a key role in discovery; discoveries are often made due to questions. Some discoveries lead to the invention of objects, processes, or techniques. \nScience.\nWithin scientific disciplines, discovery is the observation of new phenomena, actions, or events that helps explain the knowledge gathered through previously acquired scientific evidence. Discovery is made by providing observational evidence and attempts to develop an initial, rough understanding of some phenomenon.\nWithin the field of particle physics, there is an accepted requirement for defining a discovery: a five-sigma level of certainty. This level defines how statistically unlikely it is that an experimental result is due to chance. The combination of a five-sigma level of certainty, and independent confirmation by other experiments, turn findings into accepted discoveries.\nEducation.\nWithin the field of education, discovery occurs through observations. These observations are common and come in various forms. They can be observations of students done by the teacher or observations of teachers done by other professionals. Student observations help teachers identify where the students are developmentally and cognitively in the course of their studies. Teacher observations are used by administrators to hold teachers accountable for staying on target with their goals, in terms of how they teach and how they treat students.\nObservations of students completed by teachers.\nTeachers observe students throughout the day in the classroom. These observations can be informal or formal, and often involve the use of checklists, anecdotal notes, videos, interviews, written work, assessments, etc. By completing these observations, teachers can evaluate at what 'level' a student is understanding the lessons. Observations allow teachers to make necessary adaptations for the students in the classroom. These observations can also provide the foundation for strong relationships between teachers and students. When students have such relationships with teachers, they feel safer and more comfortable in the classroom and are more willing and eager to learn. Through observations, teachers identify the most developmentally appropriate practices to implement in their classrooms. These encourage and promote healthier learning styles and positive classroom atmospheres.\nObservations of teachers completed by other professionals.\nWith an educational system, government officials set different academic standards that teachers are expected to follow as a guideline for developmentally appropriate instruction. Teachers are also observed by administrators to ensure that classroom environments are positive. One of the tools used by teachers is the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) tool. Informed by findings emerging from the use of this tool, \"over 150 research studies prove that students in classrooms with high-CLASS scores have better academic and social outcomes.\" This tool focuses on encouraging positive classroom environments, regard for students' perspectives, behavior management skills, quality of feedback, and language modeling. Administrators rate each of ten categories on a scale of one to seven, one being the lowest score and seven being the highest score that a teacher may receive.\nExploration.\nWestern culture has used the term \"discovery\" in their histories to lay claims over lands and people as \"discovery\" through discovery doctrines and subtly emphasize the importance of \"exploration\" in the history of the world, such as in the \"Age of Discovery\", the New World and any frontierist endeavour even into space as the \"New Frontier\".\nIn the course of this discovery, it has been used to describe the first incursions of peoples from one culture into the geographical and cultural environment of others. However, calling it \"discovery\" has been rejected by many indigenous peoples, from whose perspective it was not a discovery but a first contact, and consider the term \"discovery\" to perpetuate colonialism, as for the discovery doctrine and frontierist concepts like \"terra nullius\".\nDiscovery and the age of discovery have been alternatively, particularly regionally, referred to through the terms contact, \"Age of Contact\" or \"Contact Period\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nSpecific references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many animals may express emotions through their face. Sense organs in the faces of different animals are varied such as the snout, and the proboscis. Many animals are flat-faced (brachycephalic) such as the pug dog. \nThe human face is crucial for identity, and damage such as scarring or developmental deformities may adversely affect the psyche.\nHuman face.\nStructure.\nThe front of the human head is called the face. It includes several distinct areas, of which the main features are:\nFacial appearance is vital for human recognition and communication. Facial muscles in humans allow expression of emotions.\nThe face is itself a highly sensitive region of the human body and its expression may change when the brain is stimulated by any of the many human senses, such as touch, temperature, smell, taste, hearing, movement, hunger, or visual stimuli.\nVariability.\nThe face is the feature which best distinguishes a person. Specialized regions of the human brain, such as the fusiform face area (FFA), enable facial recognition; when these are damaged, it may be impossible to recognize faces even of intimate family members. The pattern of specific organs, such as the eyes, or of parts of them, is used in biometric identification to uniquely identify individuals.\nShape.\nThe shape of the face is influenced by the bone-structure of the skull, and each face is unique through the anatomical variation present in the bones of the viscerocranium (and neurocranium). The bones involved in shaping the face are mainly the maxilla, mandible, nasal bone, zygomatic bone, and frontal bone. Also important are various soft tissues, such as fat, hair and skin (of which color may vary).\nThe face changes over time, and features common in children or babies, such as prominent buccal fat-pads disappear over time, their role in the infant is to stabilize the cheeks during suckling.\nWhile the buccal fat-pads often diminish in size, the prominence of bones increase with age as they grow and develop.\nFacial shape \u2013 such as facial symmetry \u2013 is an important determinant of beauty.\nOther characteristics.\nVisible variable features of the face other than shapes and proportions include color (paleness, suntan and genetic default pigmentation), hair (length, color, loss, graying), wrinkles, facial hair (e.g. beards), skin sagging, discolorations (dark spots, freckles and eye circles), pore-variabilities, skin blemishes (pimples, scars, burn marks). Many of these features can also vary over time due to aging,&lt;ref name=\"10.1111/ics.12128\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"10.1186/s13104-019-4404-z\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; skin care, nutrition,&lt;ref name=\"10.1111/jdv.16614\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"10.3892/etm.2019.8342\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the exposome&lt;ref name=\"10.1016/j.jdermsci.2016.09.015\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (such as harmful substances of the general environment, workplace and cosmetics), psychological factors, and behavior (such as smoking, sleep, physical activity and sun damage).\nMechanisms underlying these include changes related to peptides (notably collagen), inflammation, production of various proteins (notably elastin and other ECM proteins), the structure of subcutaneous tissue,&lt;ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pone.0008021\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; hormones, fibers (such as elastic fibers or elasticity) and the skin barrier.\nThe desire of many to look young for their age and/or attractive has led to the establishment of a large cosmetics industry, which is largely concerned with make-up that is applied on top of the skin (topically) to temporarily change appearance but it or dermatology also develop anti-aging products (and related products and procedures) that in some cases affect underlying biology and are partly applied preventively. Facial traits are also used in biometrics and there have been attempts at reproducible quantifications.&lt;ref name=\"10.1117/12.975404\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Skin health is considered a major factor in human well-being and the perception of health in humans.&lt;ref name=\"10.1016/j.clindermatol.2019.04.002\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nGenetics.\nGenes are a major factor in the particular appearance of a person's face with the high similarity of faces of indicating that most of facial variability is determined genetically.\nStudies have identified genes and gene regions determining face shape and differences in various facial features. A 2021 study found that a version of a gene associated with lip thickness \u2013 possibly selected for due to adaption to cold climate via fat distribution \u2013 introgressed from ancient humans \u2013 Denisovans \u2013 into the modern humans Native Americans. Another study found look-alike humans (doppelg\u00e4ngers) have genetic similarities, sharing genes affecting not only the face but also some phenotypes of physique and behavior. A study identified genes controlling the shape of the nose and chin. Biological databases may be used to aggregate and discover associations between facial phenotypes and genes.\nFunction.\nEmotional expression.\nFaces are essential to expressing emotion, consciously or unconsciously. A frown denotes disapproval; a smile usually means someone is pleased. Being able to read emotion in another's face is \"the fundamental basis for empathy and the ability to interpret a person's reactions and predict the probability of ensuing behaviors\". One study used the Multimodal Emotion Recognition Test to attempt to determine how to measure emotion. This research aimed at using a measuring device to accomplish what many people do every day: read emotion in a face.\nThe muscles of the face play a prominent role in the expression of emotion, and vary among different individuals, giving rise to additional diversity in expression and facial features.\nPeople are also relatively good at determining if a smile is real or fake. A recent study looked at individuals judging forced and genuine smiles. While young and elderly participants equally could tell the difference for smiling young people, the \"older adult participants outperformed young adult participants in distinguishing between posed and spontaneous smiles\". This suggests that with experience and age, we become more accurate at perceiving true emotions across various age groups.\nPerception and recognition.\nGestalt psychologists theorize that a face is not merely a set of facial features, but is rather something meaningful in its form. This is consistent with the Gestalt theory that an image is seen in its entirety, not by its individual parts. According to Gary L. Allen, people adapted to respond more to faces during evolution as the natural result of being a social species. Allen suggests that the purpose of recognizing faces has its roots in the \"parent-infant attraction, a quick and low-effort means by which parents and infants form an internal representation of each other, reducing the likelihood that the parent will abandon his or her offspring because of recognition failure\". Allen's work takes a psychological perspective that combines evolutionary theories with Gestalt psychology.\nBiological perspective.\nResearch has indicated that certain areas of the brain respond particularly well to faces. The fusiform face area, within the fusiform gyrus, is activated by faces, and it is activated differently for shy and social people. A study confirmed that \"when viewing images of strangers, shy adults exhibited significantly less activation in the fusiform gyri than did social adults\". Furthermore, particular areas respond more to a face that is considered attractive, as seen in another study: \"Facial beauty evokes a widely distributed neural network involving perceptual, decision-making and reward circuits. In those experiments, the perceptual response across FFA and LOC [lateral occipital complex] remained present even when subjects were not attending explicitly to facial beauty\".\nSociety and culture.\nCosmetic surgery.\nCosmetic surgery can be used to alter the appearance of the facial features. Maxillofacial surgery may also be used in cases of facial trauma, injury to the face and skin diseases. Severely disfigured individuals have received full face transplants and partial transplants of skin and muscle tissue.\nCaricatures.\nCaricatures often exaggerate facial features to make a face more easily recognized in association with a pronounced portion of the face of the individual in question\u2014for example, a caricature of Osama bin Laden might focus on his facial hair and nose; a caricature of George W. Bush might enlarge his ears to the size of an elephant's; a caricature of Jay Leno may pronounce his head and chin; and a caricature of Mick Jagger might enlarge his lips. Exaggeration of memorable features helps people to recognize others when presented in a caricature form.\nMetaphor.\nBy extension, anything which is the forward or world-facing part of a system which has internal structure is considered its \"face\", like the fa\u00e7ade of a building. For example, a public relations or press officer might be called the \"face\" of the organization he or she represents. \"Face\" is also used metaphorically in a sociological context to refer to reputation or standing in society, particularly Chinese society, and is spoken of as a resource which can be won or lost. Because of the association with individuality, the anonymous person is sometimes referred to as \"faceless\".\nOther animals.\nThe cephalic index is used to classify the shapes of the skull that determines the shape of the face of many animals. In particular the index is used in cat and dog breeding, and in farming. The shaping of the skull can result in the flat-faced appearance known in brachycephalic animals.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It supports the weight of the head and protects the nerves that transmit sensory and motor information between the brain and the rest of the body. Additionally, the neck is highly flexible, allowing the head to turn and move in all directions. Anatomically, the human neck is divided into four compartments: vertebral, visceral, and two vascular compartments. Within these compartments, the neck houses the cervical vertebrae, the cervical portion of the spinal cord, upper parts of the respiratory and digestive tracts, endocrine glands, nerves, arteries\u2063\u2063 and veins. The muscles of the neck, which are separate from the compartments, form the boundaries of the neck triangles.\nIn anatomy, the neck is also referred to as the ' or '. However, when the term \"cervix\" is used alone, it often refers to the uterine cervix, the neck of the \u2063\u2063uterus\u2063\u2063. Therefore, the adjective \"cervical\" can refer either to the neck (as in \"cervical vertebrae\" or \"cervical lymph nodes\") or to the uterine cervix (as in \"cervical cap\" or \"cervical cancer\").\nStructure.\nCompartments.\nThe neck structures are distributed within four compartments:\nBesides the listed structures, the neck contains cervical lymph nodes which surround the blood vessels.\nMuscles and triangles.\nMuscles of the neck attach to the skull, hyoid bone, clavicles and the sternum. They bound the two major neck triangles; anterior and posterior.\nAnterior triangle is defined by the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, inferior edge of the mandible and the midline of the neck. It contains the stylohyoid, digastric, mylohyoid, geniohyoid, omohyoid, sternohyoid, thyrohyoid and sternothyroid muscles. These muscles are grouped as the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles depending on if they are located superiorly or inferiorly to the hyoid bone. The suprahyoid muscles (stylohyoid, digastric, mylohyoid, geniohyoid) elevate the hyoid bone, while the infrahyoid muscles (omohyoid, sternohyoid, thyrohyoid, sternothyroid) depress it. Acting synchronously, both groups facilitate speech and swallowing.\nPosterior triangle is bordered by the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, anterior border of the trapezius muscle and the superior edge of the middle third of the clavicle. This triangle contains the sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, splenius capitis, levator scapulae, omohyoid, anterior, middle and posterior scalene muscles.\nNerve supply.\nSensation to the front areas of the neck comes from the roots of the spinal nerves C2-C4, and at the back of the neck from the roots of C4-C5.\nIn addition to nerves coming from and within the human spine, the accessory nerve and vagus nerve travel down the neck.\nBlood supply and vessels.\nThe head and neck get the majority of its blood supply through the carotid and vertebral arteries. Arteries which supply the neck are common carotid arteries, which bifurcate into the internal and external carotid arteries.\nSurface anatomy.\nThe thyroid cartilage of the larynx forms a bulge in the midline of the neck called the Adam's apple. The Adam's apple is usually more prominent in men. Inferior to the Adam's apple is the cricoid cartilage. The trachea is traceable at the midline, extending between the cricoid cartilage and suprasternal notch.\nFrom a lateral aspect, the sternomastoid muscle is the most striking mark. It separates the anterior triangle of the neck from the posterior. The upper part of the anterior triangle contains the submandibular glands, which lie just below the posterior half of the mandible. The line of the common and the external carotid arteries can be marked by joining the sterno-clavicular articulation to the angle of the jaw. Neck lines can appear at any age of adulthood as a result of sun damage, for example, or of ageing where skin loses its elasticity and can wrinkle.\nThe eleventh cranial nerve or spinal accessory nerve corresponds to a line drawn from a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process to the middle of the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle and thence across the posterior triangle to the deep surface of the trapezius. The external jugular vein can usually be seen through the skin; it runs in a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the middle of the clavicle, and close to it are some small lymphatic glands. The anterior jugular vein is smaller and runs down about half an inch from the middle line of the neck. The clavicle or collarbone forms the lower limit of the neck, and laterally the outward slope of the neck to the shoulder is caused by the trapezius muscle.\nPain.\nDisorders of the neck are a common source of pain. The neck has a great deal of functionality but is also subject to a lot of stress. Common sources of neck pain (and related pain syndromes, such as pain that radiates down the arm) include (and are strictly limited to):\nCircumference.\nHigher neck circumference has been associated with cardiometabolic risk. Upper-body fat distribution is a worse prognostic compared to lower-body fat distribution for diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus or ischemic cardiopathy. Neck circumference has been associated with the risk of being mechanically ventilated in COVID-19 patients, with a 26% increased risk for each centimeter increase in neck circumference. Moreover, hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a \"large neck phenotype\" on admission had a more than double risk of death.\nThe circumference of the neck typically varies between males and females due to differences in body composition, muscle mass, and hormonal influences. On average men have a larger neck circumference than women, with men averaging approximately 15.2 inches (38.7\u00a0cm) and women around 13.1 inches (33.3\u00a0cm). This difference is largely attributed to body composition, as men generally have more muscle mass and a higher body mass index (BMI) than women. Hormonal differences also play a significant role, as testosterone, which is present at higher levels in men, promotes muscle growth, including in the neck area.\nAnimals.\nThe neck appears in some of the earliest of tetrapod fossils, and the functionality provided has led to its being retained in all land vertebrates as well as marine-adapted tetrapods such as turtles, seals, and penguins. Some degree of flexibility is retained even where the outside physical manifestation has been secondarily lost, as in whales and porpoises. A morphologically functioning neck also appears among insects. Its absence in fish and aquatic arthropods is notable, as many have life stations similar to a terrestrial or tetrapod counterpart or could otherwise make use of the added flexibility.\nThe word \"neck\" is sometimes used as a convenience to refer to the region behind the head in some snails, gastropod molluscs, even though there is no clear distinction between this area, the head area, and the rest of the body."}

{"id": "53238", "revid": "1318178707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53238", "title": "Arm", "text": "Proximal part of the free upper limb between the shoulder and the elbow\nIn human anatomy, the arm refers to the upper limb in common usage, although academically the term specifically means the upper arm between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. The distal part of the upper arm between the elbow and the radiocarpal joint (wrist joint) is known as the forearm or \"lower\" arm, and the extremity beyond the wrist is the hand.\nBy anatomical definitions, the bones, ligaments and skeletal muscles of the shoulder girdle, as well as the axilla between them, are considered parts of the upper limb, and thus also components of the arm. The Latin term \"brachium\", which serves as a root word for naming many anatomical structures, may refer to either the upper arm as a whole or to the upper arm on its own.\nStructure.\nBones.\nThe humerus is one of the three long bones of the arm. It joins with the scapula at the shoulder joint and with the other long bones of the arm, the ulna and radius at the elbow joint. The elbow is a complex hinge joint between the end of the humerus and the ends of the radius and ulna.\nMuscles.\nThe arm is divided by a fascial layer (known as lateral and medial intermuscular septa) separating the muscles into two \"osteofascial compartments\": the anterior and the posterior compartments of the arm. The fascia merges with the periosteum (outer bone layer) of the humerus.\nThe anterior compartment contains three muscles: biceps brachii, brachialis and coracobrachialis muscles. They are all innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve. The posterior compartment contains only the triceps brachii muscle, supplied by the radial nerve.\nNerve supply.\nThe musculocutaneous nerve, from C5, C6, C7, is the main supplier of muscles of the anterior compartment. It originates from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus of nerves. It pierces the coracobrachialis muscle and gives off branches to the muscle, as well as to brachialis and biceps brachii. It terminates as the anterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm.\nThe radial nerve, which is from the fifth cervical spinal nerve to the first thoracic spinal nerve, originates as the continuation of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. This nerve enters the lower triangular space (an imaginary space bounded by, amongst others, the shaft of the humerus and the triceps brachii) of the arm and lies deep to the triceps brachii. Here it travels with the deep artery of the arm, which sits in the radial groove of the humerus. This fact is very important clinically as a fracture of the shaft of the bone here can cause lesions or even transections in the nerve.\nOther nerves passing through give no supply to the arm. These include:\nBlood supply.\nThe main artery in the arm is the brachial artery. This artery is a big continuation of the axillary artery. The point at which the axillary becomes the brachial is distal to the lower border of teres major. The brachial artery gives off an unimportant branch, the deep artery of arm. This branching occurs just below the lower border of teres major.\nThe brachial artery continues to the cubital fossa in the anterior compartment of the arm. It travels in a plane between the biceps and triceps muscles, the same as the median nerve and basilic vein. It is accompanied by venae comitantes (accompanying veins). It gives branches to the muscles of the anterior compartment. The artery is in between the median nerve and the tendon of the biceps muscle in the cubital fossa. It then continues into the forearm.\nThe deep artery of the arm travels through the lower triangular space with the radial nerve. From here onwards it has an intimate relationship with the radial nerve. They are both found deep to the triceps muscle and are located on the spiral groove of the humerus. Therefore, fracture of the bone may not only lead to lesion of the radial nerve, but also haematoma of the internal structures of the arm. The artery then continues on to anastamose with the recurrent radial branch of the brachial artery, providing a diffuse blood supply for the elbow joint.\nVeins.\nThe veins of the arm carry blood from the extremities of the limb, as well as drain the arm itself. The two main veins are the basilic and the cephalic veins. There is a connecting vein between the two, the median cubital vein, which passes through the cubital fossa and is clinically important for venepuncture (withdrawing blood).\nThe basilic vein travels on the medial side of the arm and terminates at the level of the seventh rib.\nThe cephalic vein travels on the lateral side of the arm and terminates as the axillary vein. It passes through the deltopectoral triangle, a space between the deltoid and the pectoralis major muscles.\nSociety and culture.\nIn Hindu, Buddhist and Egyptian iconography the symbol of the arm is used to illustrate the power of the sovereign. In Hindu tradition gods are depicted with several arms which carry specific symbols of their powers. It is believed that several arms depict omnipotence of gods. In popular culture Thakur did not have arms in the movie Sholay.\nIn West Africa, the Bambara use forearm to symbolize the spirit, which is a link between God and man.\nSymbolic gestures of raising both hands signal surrender, appeals for mercy, and justice.\nClinical significance.\nThe cubital fossa is clinically important for venepuncture and for blood pressure measurement.\nWhen the arm is fractured this may refer to a fracture of the humerus bone.\nVeins on the arm may be taken when a coronary artery bypass graft is needed.\nOther animals.\nIn other animals, the term \"arm\" can also be used for homologous or analogous structures (such as one of the paired forelimbs of a four-legged animal or the arms of cephalopods, respectively). In anatomical usage, the term \"arm\" may sometimes refer specifically to the segment between the shoulder and the elbow, while the segment between the elbow and wrist is the forearm. However, in common, literary, and historical usage, \"arm\" refers to the entire upper arm from shoulder to wrist. This article uses the former definition; see upper limb for the wider definition.\nIn primates, the arm is adapted for precise positioning of the hand and thus assist in the hand's manipulative tasks. The ball and socket shoulder joint allows for movement of the arms in a wide circular plane, while the structure of the two forearm bones which can rotate around each other allows for additional range of motion at that level.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first publishing was written by William Strunk Jr. in 1918, and published by Harcourt in 1920, comprising eight \"elementary rules of usage,\" ten \"elementary principles of composition,\" \"a few matters of form,\" a list of 49 \"words and expressions commonly misused,\" and a list of 57 \"words often misspelled.\" Writer and editor E. B. White greatly enlarged and revised the book for publication by Macmillan in 1959. That was the first edition of the book, which \"Time\" recognized in 2011 as one of the 100 best and most influential non-fiction books written in English since 1923. \nAmerican wit Dorothy Parker said, regarding the book:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If you have any young friends who aspire to become writers, the second-greatest favor you can do them is to present them with copies of \"The Elements of Style\". The first-greatest, of course, is to shoot them now, while they're happy.\nHistory.\nCornell University English professor William Strunk Jr. wrote \"The Elements of Style\" in 1918 and privately published it in 1919, for use at the university. Harcourt republished it in 52-page format in 1920. Strunk and editor Edward A. Tenney later revised it for publication as \"The Elements and Practice of Composition\" (1935). In 1957, the style guide reached the attention of E.B. White at \"The New Yorker\". White had studied writing under Strunk in 1919 but had since forgotten \"the little book\" that he described as a \"forty-three-page summation of the case for cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English.\" Weeks later, White wrote about Strunk's devotion to lucid English prose in his column.\nStrunk died in 1946. Macmillan and Company subsequently commissioned White to revise \"The Elements\" for a 1959 edition. White's expansion and modernization of Strunk and Tenney's 1935 revised edition yielded the writing style manual informally known as \"Strunk &amp; White\", the first edition of which sold about two million copies in 1959. More than ten million copies of three editions were later sold. Mark Garvey relates the history of the book in \"Stylized: A Slightly Obsessive History of Strunk &amp; White's The Elements of Style\" (2009).\nMaira Kalman, who provided the illustrations for \"The Elements of Style Illustrated\" (2005, see below), asked Nico Muhly to compose a cantata based on the book. It was performed at the New York Public Library in October 2005.\nAudiobook versions of \"The Elements\" now feature changed wording, citing \"gender issues\" with the original.\nContent.\nStrunk concentrated on the cultivation of good writing and composition; the original 1918 edition exhorted writers to \"omit needless words,\" use the active voice, and employ parallelism appropriately.\nThe 1959 edition features White's expansions of preliminary sections, the \"Introduction\" essay (derived from his magazine story about Strunk), and the concluding chapter, \"An Approach to Style,\" a broader, prescriptive guide to writing in English. He also produced the second (1972) and third (1979) editions of \"The Elements of Style\", by which time the book's length had extended to 85 pages.\nThe third edition of \"The Elements of Style\" (1979) features 54 points: a list of common word-usage errors; 11 rules of punctuation and grammar; 11 principles of writing; 11 matters of form; and, in Chapter V, 21 reminders for better style. The final reminder, the 21st, \"Prefer the standard to the offbeat,\" is thematically integral to the subject of \"The Elements of Style\", yet it does stand as a discrete essay about writing lucid prose. To write well, White advises writers to have the proper mindset, that they write to please themselves, and that they aim for \"one moment of felicity,\" a phrase by Robert Louis Stevenson. Thus Strunk's 1918 recommendation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that he make every word tell.\u2014\u200a\nStrunk Jr. no longer has a comma in his name in the 1979 and later editions, due to the modernized style recommendation about punctuating such names.\nThe fourth edition of \"The Elements of Style\" (1999) omits Strunk's advice about masculine pronouns: \"unless the antecedent is or must be feminine\". In its place, the book reads, \"many writers find the use of the generic \"he\" or \"his\" to rename indefinite antecedents limiting or offensive.\" The re-titled entry \"They. He or She\", in Chapter IV: Misused Words and Expressions, advises the writer to avoid an \"unintentional emphasis on the masculine\".\nComponents new to the fourth edition include a foreword by essayist and E. B. White stepson Roger Angell, a glossary, and an index. Five years later, the fourth edition text was re-published as \"The Elements of Style Illustrated\" (2005), with illustrations by the designer Maira Kalman.\nReception.\n\"The Elements of Style\" was listed as one of the 100 best and most influential non-fiction books written in English since 1923 by \"Time\" in its 2011 list. Upon its release, Charles Poor, writing for \"The New York Times\", called it \"a splendid trophy for all who are interested in reading and writing.\" \nIn \"\" (2000, p.\u00a011), Stephen King writes: \"There is little or no detectable bullshit in that book. (Of course, it's short; at eighty-five pages it's much shorter than this one.) I'll tell you right now that every aspiring writer should read \"The Elements of Style\". Rule 17 in the chapter titled Principles of Composition is 'Omit needless words.' I will try to do that here.\"\nIn 2011, University of Vienna professor in biochemistry Tim Skern argued in \"Writing Scientific English: A Workbook\" that \"The Elements of Style\" \"remains the best book available on writing good English\".\nIn 2013, Nevile Gwynne reproduced \"The Elements of Style\" in his work \"Gwynne's Grammar\". Britt Peterson of \"The Boston Globe\" wrote that his inclusion of the book was a \"curious addition\".\nIn 2016, the Open Syllabus Project lists \"The Elements of Style\" as the most frequently assigned text in US academic syllabuses, based on an analysis of 933,635 texts appearing in over 1 million syllabuses.\nCriticism of \"Strunk &amp; White\" has largely focused on claims that it has a prescriptivist nature, or that it has become a general anachronism in the face of modern English usage. In criticizing \"The Elements of Style\", Geoffrey Pullum, professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, and co-author of \"The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language\" (2002), said that: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The book's toxic mix of purism, atavism, and personal eccentricity is not underpinned by a proper grounding in English grammar. It is often so misguided that the authors appear not to notice their own egregious flouting of its own rules\u00a0... It's sad. Several generations of college students learned their grammar from the uninformed bossiness of \"Strunk and White\", and the result is a nation of educated people who know they feel vaguely anxious and insecure whenever they write \"however\" or \"than me\" or \"was\" or \"which\", but can't tell you why.\nPullum has argued, for example, that the authors misunderstood what constitutes the passive voice, and he criticized their proscription of established and unproblematic English usages, such as the split infinitive and the use of \"which\" in a restrictive relative clause. On \"Language Log\", a blog about language written by linguists, he further criticized \"The Elements of Style\" for promoting linguistic prescriptivism and hypercorrection among Anglophones, and called it \"the book that ate America's brain\".\nJan Freeman, reviewing for \"The Boston Globe\" in 2005 described the latest edition of \"The Elements of Style Illustrated\" (2005), with illustrations by Maira Kalman, as an \"aging zombie of a book\u00a0... a hodgepodge, its now-antiquated pet peeves jostling for space with 1970s taboos and 1990s computer advice\".\nEditions.\nStrunk.\nBecause Strunk's text is now in the public domain, publishers can and do reprint it.\nSee also.\nSeveral books were titled paying homage to Strunk's, for example:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for his improvisational skills and the wide variety of characters he created spontaneously and portrayed in drama and comedy films, he is regarded as one of the greatest comedians of all time. Williams received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and six Golden Globe Awards, as well as five Grammy Awards and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. He was awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2005.\nBorn in Chicago, Williams began performing stand-up comedy in San Francisco and Los Angeles during the mid-1970s, and released several comedy albums including \"Reality ... What a Concept\" in 1980. He rose to fame playing the alien Mork in the ABC sitcom \"Mork &amp; Mindy\" (1978\u20131982). Williams received his first leading film role in \"Popeye\" (1980). He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997). His other Oscar-nominated roles were for \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" (1987), \"Dead Poets Society\" (1989), and \"The Fisher King\" (1991).\nWilliams starred in the critically acclaimed dramas \"The World According to Garp\" (1982), \"Moscow on the Hudson\" (1984), \"Awakenings\" (1990), and \"World's Greatest Dad\" (2009), as well as the psychological thrillers \"Insomnia\" (2002) and \"One Hour Photo\" (2002). His feature film comedies and family films included \"Toys\" (1992), \"The Birdcage\" (1996), and \"Patch Adams\" (1998), \"Hook\" (1991), \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" (1993), \"Jumanji\" (1995), \"Jack\" (1996), \"Flubber\" (1997), \"RV\" (2006), and the \"Night at the Museum\" series (2006\u20132014). He provided voice work in the animated films \"Aladdin\" (1992), \"Robots\" (2005), \"Happy Feet\" (2006), and \"Happy Feet Two\" (2011).\nDuring his final years, Williams struggled with severe depression before his death from suicide in 2014 at his Paradise Cay, California, home at age 63. According to his widow, Williams had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, and had been experiencing depression, anxiety, and increasing paranoia. His autopsy found \"diffuse Lewy body disease\", and Lewy body dementia professionals said his symptoms were consistent with dementia with Lewy bodies. In the weeks following his suicide, Williams was celebrated in a wave of tributes.\nEarly life and education.\nRobin McLaurin Williams was born at St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on July 21, 1951. His father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams (1906\u20131987), was a senior executive in Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division. His mother, Laurie McLaurin (1922\u20132001), was a former model from Jackson, Mississippi, whose great-grandfather was Mississippi senator and governor Anselm J. McLaurin. Williams had two older half-brothers: a paternal half-brother, Robert (also known as Todd), and a maternal half-brother, McLaurin. While his mother was a practitioner of Christian Science, Williams was raised in his father's Episcopal faith. During a television interview on \"Inside the Actors Studio\" in 2001, Williams credited his mother as an important early influence on his humor, and he tried to make her laugh to gain attention.\nWilliams attended public elementary school at Gorton Elementary School in Lake Forest and later Deer Path Junior High School. He described himself as a quiet child who did not overcome his shyness until becoming involved with his high school drama department, while friends recalled him as being very funny. In late 1963, when Williams was 12, his father was transferred to Detroit. The family lived in a 40-room farmhouse on in suburban Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where Williams attended the private all-boys Detroit Country Day School. He excelled academically, served as class president, and was on the school's wrestling team, but was also bullied for his weight and would play at home by himself.\nWith both parents working, Williams was partly raised by the family's maid, who was his main companion. When Williams was 16, his father took early retirement and the family moved to Tiburon, California. Following their move, Williams attended Redwood High School in nearby Larkspur. Williams described the school as Gestalt, he went on to join the drama club becoming involved in theater, which first helped foster his interest in arts and entertainment. At the time of his graduation in 1969, he was voted \"Most Likely Not to Succeed\" and \"Funniest\" by his classmates. After high school graduation, Williams enrolled at Claremont Men's College in Claremont, California, to study political science; he dropped out to pursue acting. Williams studied theater for three years at the College of Marin, a community college in Kentfield, California. According to the College of Marin's drama professor, James Dunn, the depth of the young actor's talent became evident when Williams was cast in the musical \"Oliver!\" as Fagin. He often improvised during his time in the drama program, leaving cast members in hysterics. Dunn called his wife after one late rehearsal to tell her Williams \"was going to be something special\".\nIn 1973, Williams attained a full scholarship to the Juilliard School (Group 6, 1973\u20131976) in New York City. He was one of 20 students accepted into the freshman class, and Williams and Christopher Reeve were the only two accepted by John Houseman for the school's Advanced Program that year. Williams's classmates included William Hurt and Mandy Patinkin. According to biographer Jean Dorsinville, Franklyn Seales and Williams were roommates at Juilliard. Reeve recalled his first impression of Williams when they were new students at Juilliard: \"He wore tie-dyed shirts with tracksuit bottoms and talked a mile a minute. I'd never seen so much energy contained in one person. He was like an untied balloon that had been inflated and immediately released. I watched in awe as he virtually caromed off the walls of the classrooms and hallways. To say that he was 'on' would be a major understatement.\"\nWilliams and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner, whom Reeve said was one of the world's leading voice and speech teachers. According to Reeve, Skinner was bewildered by Williams and his ability to instantly perform in many different accents.\nTheir primary acting teacher was Michael Kahn, who was \"equally baffled by this human dynamo\". Williams already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy. In a later production, Williams silenced his critics with his well-received performance as an old man in Tennessee Williams's \"Night of the Iguana\". Reeve wrote, \"He simply \"was\" the old man. I was astonished by his work and very grateful that fate had thrown us together.\" The two remained close friends until Reeve's death in 2004. Their friendship was like \"brothers from another mother\", according to Williams's son Zak.\nDuring the summers of 1974 to 1976, Williams worked as a busboy at The Trident in Sausalito, California. He left Juilliard during his junior year in 1976, following Houseman's suggestion that the school had nothing more they could teach him. Gerald Freedman, another of his teachers at Juilliard, called Williams a \"genius\" and that the school's conservative and classical style of training did not suit him; to those who knew him, it came as no surprise that Williams left.\nCareer.\n1976\u20131982: Stand-up comedy and \"Mork &amp; Mindy\".\nWilliams began performing stand-up comedy in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1976. His first performance took place at the Holy City Zoo, a San Francisco comedy club where he worked his way up from tending bar. During the 1960s, San Francisco had been a hub for rock music, the hippie movement, drugs, and a sexual revolution. By the late 1970s, Williams played a leading role in what critic Gerald Nachman described as the city's \"comedy renaissance\". Reflecting on that era, Williams said that he found out about \"drugs and happiness\" during that period, adding that he saw \"the best brains of my time turned to mud\". Williams moved to Los Angeles and continued performing stand-up at clubs, including the Comedy Store. There, in 1977, he was seen by television producer George Schlatter, who asked him to appear on a revival of his show \"Laugh-In\". The show aired later that year and marked Williams' television debut. That same year, he performed a show at the L.A. Improv for Home Box Office. Although the \"Laugh-In\" revival failed, it opened doors for Williams' television career; he continued performing stand-up at comedy clubs such as the Roxy to help keep his improvisational skills sharp. Williams also took his act overseas and performed at the Fighting Cocks in London.\nDavid Letterman, who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalled first seeing him perform as a newcomer at the Comedy Store in Hollywood. Letterman, already an established comedian at the time, described Williams' arrival as \"like a hurricane\", saying that he thought to himself, \"Holy crap, there goes my chance in show business.\" Williams' first credited film role was a minor part in the 1977 low-budget comedy \"Can I Do It... 'Til I Need Glasses?\". However, his first starring performance was as the title character in \"Popeye\" (1980), in which Williams showcased the acting skills previously demonstrated in his television work. The film's commercial disappointment was not blamed on his performance.\n\"Mork &amp; Mindy\".\nAfter the \"Laugh-In\" revival, and appearing in the cast of \"The Richard Pryor Show\" on NBC, Williams was cast by Garry Marshall as the alien Mork in the 1978 \"Happy Days\" episode \"My Favorite Orkan\". Sought after as a last-minute cast replacement for a departing actor, Williams impressed the producer with his quirky humor when he sat on his head when asked to take a seat for the audition. As Mork, Williams improvised much of his dialogue and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice, and he made the most of the script. The cast and crew, as well as television network executives, were deeply impressed with Williams's performance. The executives moved quickly to sign Williams four days later before competitors could make their own offers.\nMork's appearance proved so popular with viewers that it led to the spin-off television sitcom \"Mork &amp; Mindy\", which co-starred Pam Dawber, and ran from 1978 to 1982; the show was written to accommodate his extreme improvisations in dialogue and behavior. Although he portrayed the same character as in \"Happy Days\", the series was set in the present in Boulder, Colorado, instead of the late 1950s in Milwaukee. \"Mork &amp; Mindy\" at its peak had a weekly audience of sixty million and was credited with turning Williams into a \"superstar\". Among young people, the show was very popular because Williams became \"a man and a child, buoyant, rubber-faced, an endless gusher of ideas\", according to critic James Poniewozik.\nMork became popular, featured on posters, coloring books, lunch-boxes, and other merchandise. \"Mork &amp; Mindy\" was such a success in its first season that Williams appeared on the March 12, 1979, cover of \"Time\" magazine. The cover photo, taken by Michael Dressler in 1979, is said to have \"[captured] his different sides: the funnyman mugging for the camera, and a sweet, more thoughtful pose that appears on a small TV he holds in his hands\", according to Mary Forgione of the \"Los Angeles Times\". This photo was installed in the National Portrait Gallery in the Smithsonian Institution shortly after Williams died to allow visitors to pay their respects. He also appeared on the cover of the August 23, 1979, issue of \"Rolling Stone\", photographed by Richard Avedon.\nWith his success on \"Mork &amp; Mindy\", Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, including three HBO comedy specials: \"Off The Wall\" (1978), \"An Evening with Robin Williams\" (1983), and \"A Night at the Met\" (1986). Williams won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for the recording of his 1979 live show at the Copacabana in New York City, \"Reality... What a Concept\".\n1982\u20131999: Film stardom and acclaim.\nWilliams starred as the lead character in \"The World According to Garp\" (1982), which he noted \"may have lacked a certain madness onscreen, but it had a great core\". Critic Roger Ebert wrote of his performance, \"Although Robin Williams plays Garp as a relatively plausible, sometimes ordinary person, the movie never seems bothered by the jarring contrast between his cheerful pluckiness and the anarchy around him.\" Williams continued with other smaller roles in less successful films, such as \"The Survivors\" (1983) and \"Club Paradise\" (1986), although he said these roles did not help advance his film career.\nIn 1986, Williams co-hosted the 58th Academy Awards. The following year, he appeared in a sketch comedy special \"Carol, Carl, Whoopi and Robin\" (1987), acting alongside Carol Burnett, Carl Reiner, and Whoopi Goldberg. Williams was also a regular guest on various talk shows, including \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and \"Late Night with David Letterman\", on which he appeared 50 times. Williams's first major break came from his starring role in director Barry Levinson's \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" (1987), which earned Williams a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film is set in 1965 during the Vietnam War, with Williams playing the role of Adrian Cronauer, a radio shock jock who keeps troops entertained with comedy and sarcasm. Williams was allowed to play the role without a script, improvising most of his lines. Over the microphone, Williams created voice impressions of various people, including Walter Cronkite, Gomer Pyle, Elvis Presley, Mr. Ed, and Richard Nixon. \"We just let the cameras roll,\" said producer Mark Johnson, and Williams \"managed to create something new for every single take\".\nWilliams appeared opposite Steve Martin at Lincoln Center in an off-Broadway production of \"Waiting for Godot\" in 1988. Many of his subsequent roles were in comedies tinged with pathos, such as \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" (1993) and \"Patch Adams\" (1998). Looking over most of Williams's filmography, one writer was \"struck by the breadth\" and radical diversity of most of the roles Williams portrayed. In 1989, he played a private-school English teacher in \"Dead Poets Society\", which included a final, emotional scene that some critics said \"inspired a generation\" and became a part of pop culture. Similarly, Williams's performance as a therapist in \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997) deeply affected even some real therapists. In \"Awakenings\" (1990), he plays a doctor modeled after Oliver Sacks, who wrote the book on which the film is based. Sacks later said the way Williams's mind worked was a \"form of genius\". In 1991, Williams played an adult Peter Pan in the film \"Hook\", although he had said that he would have to lose 25 pounds for the role. Terry Gilliam, who directed Williams in two of his films, \"The Fisher King\" (1991) and \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" (1988), said in 1992 that Williams had the ability to \"go from manic to mad to tender and vulnerable... [Williams had] the most unique mind on the planet. There's nobody like him out there.\"\nWhile Williams voiced characters in several animated films, his voice role as the Genie in the animated musical \"Aladdin\" (1992) was written for Williams. The film's directors said that they had taken a risk by writing the role. At first, Williams refused the role because it was a Disney movie and he did not want the studio profiting by selling merchandise based on the movie. Williams accepted the role with certain conditions: \"I'm doing it basically because I want to be part of this animation tradition. I want something for my children. One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything\u2014as in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff.\" Williams improvised much of his dialogue, recording approximately 30 hours of tape, and impersonated dozens of celebrities, including Ed Sullivan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, William F. Buckley Jr., Peter Lorre, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arsenio Hall. Williams's role in \"Aladdin\" became one of his most recognized and best-loved, and the film was the highest-grossing of 1992; it won numerous awards, including a Special Golden Globe Award for Vocal Work in a Motion Picture for Williams. His performance paved the way for other animated films to incorporate actors with more star power. Williams was named a Disney Legend in 2009.\nDue to Disney breaking an agreement with Williams regarding the use of the Genie in the advertising for \"Aladdin\", he refused to sign for the direct-to-video sequel, \"The Return of Jafar\" (1994); the Genie was instead voiced by Dan Castellaneta. When Jeffrey Katzenberg was replaced by Joe Roth as Walt Disney Studios chairman, Roth organized a public apology to Williams. He would, in turn, reprise the role in the second sequel, \"Aladdin and the King of Thieves\" (1996). During this time, Williams lent his voice to \"\" (1992). Other dramatic performances by Williams include \"Moscow on the Hudson\" (1984), \"What Dreams May Come\" (1998), and \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999). During the early 2000s, Williams demonstrated a new rank of his versatility by playing darker roles than he had in the previous decades. Williams appeared with fellow comedian, Billy Crystal, in an unscripted cameo at the beginning of a 1997 episode of the third season of \"Friends\".\nWilliams's performances garnered various accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in \"Good Will Hunting\"; as well as two previous Academy Award nominations, for \"Dead Poets Society\", and as a troubled homeless man in \"The Fisher King\", respectively. Among the actors who helped Williams during his acting career, he credited Robert De Niro, from whom Williams learned the power of silence and economy of dialogue when acting. From Dustin Hoffman, with whom Williams co-starred in \"Hook\", he learned to take on totally different character types, and to transform his characters by extreme preparation. Mike Medavoy, producer of \"Hook\", told its director, Steven Spielberg, that he intentionally teamed up Hoffman and Williams for the film because he knew they wanted to work together, and that Williams welcomed the opportunity of working with Spielberg. Having Woody Allen, who directed him and Billy Crystal in \"Deconstructing Harry\" (1997), helped Williams. Allen knew that Crystal and Williams had often worked together on stage.\n2000\u20132014: Children's films, return to television, and final years.\nWilliams was the host of a talk show for Audible that aired in April 2000 and was only available on Audible's website. In \"Insomnia\" (2002), Williams portrayed a murderer on the run from a sleep-deprived Los Angeles police detective (played by Al Pacino) in rural Alaska. That same year, in the psychological thriller \"One Hour Photo\", Williams portrayed an emotionally disturbed photo development technician who becomes obsessed with a family for whom he has developed pictures for a long time. In the 2004 science fiction psychological thriller \"The Final Cut\", Williams played a professional who specializes in editing the memories of unsavory people into uncritical memorials that are played at funerals. His many television appearances included an episode of \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\", and Williams starred in an episode of \"\". He headlined his own one-man show, \"Robin Williams: Live on Broadway\", which played at the Broadway Theatre in July 2002.\nWilliams's stand-up work was a consistent thread throughout his career, as seen by the success of his one-man show (and subsequent DVD), \"Robin Williams: Live on Broadway\" (2002). In 2004, Williams was voted 13th on Comedy Central's list of \"100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time\". Two years later, he was the Surprise Guest at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, and appeared on an episode of \"\" that aired January 30. After a six-year hiatus, in August 2008, Williams announced a new 26-city tour, \"Weapons of Self-Destruction\". The tour began at the end of September 2009, and concluded in New York on December 3, and was the subject of an HBO Special on December 8, 2009.\nYears after the films, Janet Hirshenson revealed in an interview that Williams had expressed interest in portraying Rubeus Hagrid in the \"Harry Potter\" film series, but was rejected by director Chris Columbus due to the \"British-only edict\". In 2006, Williams starred in five movies, including \"Man of the Year\", a political satire, and \"The Night Listener\", a thriller about a radio show host who realizes that a child with whom he has developed a friendship may not exist. Williams continued to provide voices in other animated films, including \"Robots\" (2005), the \"Happy Feet\" film franchise (2006\u20132011), and an uncredited vocal performance in \"Everyone's Hero\" (2006). He also voiced the holographic character Dr. Know in the live-action film \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" (2001). Williams was the voice of The Timekeeper, a former attraction at the Walt Disney World Resort about a time-traveling robot who encounters Jules Verne and brings him to the future.\nIn 2010, Williams appeared in a sketch with Robert De Niro on \"Saturday Night Live\", and in 2012, he guest-starred as himself in two FX series, \"Louie\" and \"Wilfred\". Williams made his Broadway acting debut in Rajiv Joseph's \"Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo\", which opened at the Richard Rodgers Theatre March 31, 2011. For his performance, Williams was nominated for the Drama League Award for Outstanding Distinguished Performer. In May 2013, CBS started a new series, \"The Crazy Ones\", starring Williams, which was canceled after one season. \"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn\" was his last movie to be released during his lifetime. In the movie, Williams played Henry Altmann, an angry, bitter man who tries to change his life after being told he has a terminal illness. Four films starring Williams were released after his death in 2014: \"\", \"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\", \"Boulevard\", and \"Absolutely Anything\".\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and children.\nWilliams married actress Valerie Velardi in 1978, following a live-in relationship with comedian, writer, and actress Elayne Boosler. Velardi and Williams met in 1976 while he was working as a bartender at a San Francisco tavern. Their son, Zachary Pym, was born in 1983. Velardi and Williams were divorced in 1988.\nWhile it was reported that Williams began an affair with Zachary's nanny, Marsha Garces, in 1986, Velardi stated in the 2018 documentary, \"\", that the relationship with Garces began after the two had separated. On April 30, 1989, Williams married Garces, who was six months pregnant with their first child. They had two children, Zelda Rae (born 1989) and Cody Alan (born 1991). In March 2008, Garces filed for divorce from Williams, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in 2010.\nIn 2011, Williams married graphic designer Susan Schneider, and they remained married until his death. They lived at their house in Sea Cliff, San Francisco, California. Williams said, \"My children give me a great sense of wonder. Just to see them develop into these extraordinary human beings.\"\nInterests.\nIn New York City, Williams was part of the West Side YMCA runners club and showed promising results with 34:21 minutes at a 10K run in Central Park in 1975. His favorite novels were \"The Foundation Trilogy\": \"Foundation\" (1951), \"Foundation and Empire\" (1952), and \"Second Foundation\" (1953) by Isaac Asimov, and his favorite book as a child was \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" (1950), which he later shared with his children.\nWilliams enjoyed pen-and-paper role-playing games and video games. His daughter Zelda was named after Princess Zelda from \"The Legend of Zelda\", a family favorite video game series, and Williams sometimes performed at consumer entertainment trade shows.\nWilliams was a fan of anime and collectible figures. His daughter described him as a \"figurine hoarder\"; one of his figures was the character Deunan Knute from the 2004 anime film \"Appleseed\", of which Williams was a fan. He also liked the 2004 anime film \"\".\nWilliams became a devoted cycling enthusiast, having taken it up partly as a substitute for drugs. He accumulated a large bicycle collection and became a fan of professional road cycling, often traveling to racing events such as the Tour de France. In 2016, Williams' children donated 87 of his bicycles in support of the Challenged Athletes Foundation and Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation.\nReligion.\nWilliams was raised and sometimes identified himself as an Episcopalian. In a comedy routine, Williams described his denomination as: \"I have that idea of Chicago Protestant, Episcopal\u2014Catholic light: half the religion, half the guilt.\" He also described himself as an \"honorary Jew\".\nPhilanthropy.\nIn 1986, Williams teamed up with Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Crystal to establish Comic Relief USA. This annual HBO television benefit devoted to the homeless raised $80million as of 2014. Bob Zmuda, creator of Comic Relief, explains that Williams felt blessed because he came from a wealthy home, but wanted to do something to help those less fortunate. Williams made benefit appearances to support literacy and women's rights, along with appearing at benefits for veterans. He was a regular on the USO circuit, where Williams traveled to 13 countries and performed to approximately 90,000 troops. After his death, the USO thanked Williams \"for all he did for the men and women of our armed forces\".\nWilliams and his second wife Marsha founded a philanthropic organization called the Windfall Foundation to raise money for many charities. In December 1999, he sang in French on the BBC-inspired music video of international celebrities doing a cover version of the Rolling Stones' 1974 single \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\" for the charity Children's Promise.\nIn response to the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, Williams donated all proceeds of his \"Weapons of Self Destruction\" Christchurch performance to help rebuild the New Zealand city. Half the proceeds were donated to the Red Cross and half to the mayoral building fund. Williams performed with the USO for U.S. troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. For several years, Williams supported St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\nSubstance abuse.\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, Williams was addicted to cocaine. He was a casual friend of the \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian John Belushi, and partied with him the night before Belushi died of a drug overdose in 1982. The shock of Belushi's death, along with the birth of his son Zak, prompted Williams to get sober: \"Was it a wake-up call? Oh yeah, on a huge level. The grand jury helped, too.\" Williams turned to exercise and cycling to help alleviate his depression after Belushi's death; according to the bicycle shop owner Tony Tom, Williams said \"cycling saved my life\".\nIn 2003, Williams began abusing alcohol again during production of the film \"The Big White\" (2005) in Alaska. In 2006, he checked into a substance-abuse rehabilitation center in Newberg, Oregon. Years later, Williams acknowledged his failure to maintain sobriety, but said that he never returned to using cocaine, saying in a 2010 interview: \"Cocaine\u2014paranoid and impotent, what fun. There was no bit of me thinking, ooh, let's go back to that. Useless conversations until midnight, waking up at dawn feeling like a vampire on a day pass.\" In mid-2014, Williams was admitted to the Hazelden Foundation Addiction Treatment Center in Center City, Minnesota, again for alcoholism.\nHealth problems.\nIn March 2009, Williams was hospitalized due to heart problems. He postponed his one-man tour for surgery to replace his aortic valve, repair his mitral valve and correct his irregular heartbeat. The surgery was completed March 13, 2009, at the Cleveland Clinic.\nWilliams's publicist, Mara Buxbaum, commented that he had severe depression before his death. His wife, Susan Schneider, said that in the period before his death, Williams had been sober but was diagnosed with early-stage Parkinson's disease, which he had not made public. An autopsy revealed that Williams had diffuse Lewy bodies, which had been misdiagnosed as Parkinson's, and this may have contributed to his depression.\nIn an essay published in the journal \"Neurology\" two years after his death, Schneider revealed that the pathology of Lewy body disease in Williams was described by several doctors as among the worst pathologies they had seen. She described the early symptoms of his disease as beginning in October 2013. Williams's initial condition included a sudden and prolonged spike in fear, anxiety, stress, and insomnia, which worsened in severity and included memory loss, paranoia, and delusions. According to Schneider, \"Robin was losing his mind and he was aware of it... He kept saying, 'I just want to reboot my brain.'\"\nDeath.\nWilliams died in his Paradise Cay, California, home on August 11, 2014. His primary cause of death was declared as suicide by hanging amid Lewy body dementia (LBD) and other associated factors. Describing the disease as \"the terrorist inside my husband's brain\", Schneider said that \"however you look at it\u2014the presence of Lewy bodies took his life\", referring to his previous diagnosis of Parkinson's. She noted \"how we as a culture don't have the vocabulary to discuss brain disease in the way we do about depression. Depression is a symptom of LBD and it's not about psychology \u2013 it's rooted in neurology. His brain was falling apart.\" Medical experts had earlier struggled to determine a cause, and had eventually diagnosed him with Parkinson's disease.\nThe Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) clarified the distinction between the term used in Williams's autopsy report, \"diffuse Lewy body dementia\", which is more commonly called \"diffuse Lewy body disease\", and refers to the underlying disease process\u2014and the umbrella term, \"Lewy body dementia\"\u2014which encompasses both Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). According to LBDA spokesperson Dennis Dickson, \"The report confirms he experienced depression, anxiety, and paranoia, which may occur in either Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies... In early PD, Lewy bodies are generally limited in distribution, but in DLB, the Lewy bodies are spread widely throughout the brain, as was the case with Robin Williams.\" Ian G. McKeith, professor and researcher of Lewy body dementias, said that Williams's symptoms and autopsy findings were explained by DLB. Williams's body was cremated at Monte's Chapel of the Hills in San Anselmo, and his ashes were scattered over San Francisco Bay on August 21, 2014.\nAftermath and tributes.\nAfter Williams's death was announced, media outlets published eulogies written by his family and associates, including Susan Schneider, Marsha Garces Williams, Zelda Williams, and Russell Brand. Many other artists and celebrities offered public acknowledgements on social media. President Barack Obama released a statement shortly after Williams's death:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between ... He arrived in our lives as an alien\u2014but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit. He made us laugh. He made us cry. He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most\u2014from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets.\nAt the time of his death, Williams planned to appear as the \"Blackmail\" special guest for the final night of Monty Python's ten-date stage shows in London with his friend Eric Idle but canceled, citing severe depression. The show's home video release was dedicated to Williams.\nDuring the opening of the International Youth Day at the United Nations headquarters, Assistant Secretary General Thomas Gass stood on the pulpit of the United Nations Economic and Social Council Chamber and quoted one of Keating's lines from \"Dead Poets Society\": \"Dare to look at things in a different way!\". Several fans paid tribute to Williams on social media with photo and video reenactments of \"Dead Poets Society\"'s \"O Captain! My Captain!\" scene.\nShortly after Williams's death, Disney Channel, Disney XD, and Disney Junior aired \"Aladdin\" commercial-free over the course of a week, with a dedicated drawing of the Genie at the end of each airing before the credits. In honor of his theater work, the lights of Broadway were darkened for the evening of August 14. That night, the cast of the \"Aladdin\" musical joined the audience in a sing-along of \"Friend Like Me\", an Oscar-nominated song originally performed by Williams.\nFans of Williams created makeshift memorials at his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and at locations from his television and film career, such as the bench in Boston's Public Garden featured in \"Good Will Hunting\"; the Pacific Heights, San Francisco, home used in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\"; the sign for Parrish Shoes in Keene, New Hampshire, where parts of \"Jumanji\" were filmed; and the Boulder, Colorado, home used for \"Mork &amp; Mindy\".\nDuring the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 25, Billy Crystal presented a tribute to Williams, referring to him as \"the brightest star in our comedy galaxy\". Afterward, some of Williams's best comedy moments were shown, including his first \"The Tonight Show\" appearance, indicating his great life in making people laugh. Talk show hosts, including David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon, paid tribute to Williams on their respective shows.\nOn September 9, 2014, PBS aired a one-hour special devoted to Williams's career. Later that month, family members and celebrities paid tribute to his life and career in San Francisco. British heavy metal band Iron Maiden dedicated a song to Williams, titled \"Tears of a Clown\", on their 2015 album \"The Book of Souls\". The song looks into his depression and suicide, and how he attempted to hide his condition from the public.\nA tunnel painted with a rainbow on Highway 101, north of the Golden Gate Bridge, was officially named the \"Robin Williams Tunnel\" on February 29, 2016. In 2017, Sharon Meadow in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the home of the annual Comedy Day, was renamed \"Robin Williams Meadow\".\nIn 2018, HBO produced a documentary about his life and career. Directed by Marina Zenovich, the film \"\" was also screened at the Sundance Film Festival. That same year, a mural of Robin Williams was created on Market Street in San Francisco. Work on a biography was begun by \"The New York Times\" writer David Itzkoff in 2014, and was published four years later, titled \"Robin\".\nIn September 2020, Vertical Entertainment released a documentary titled \"Robin's Wish\" about Williams's battle with Lewy body dementia. In May 2022, Williams was inducted into a hall of fame at the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New York. In 2025, the deceased Williams became the subject of a controversy over AI generated videos in which his daughter, Zelda Williams, pleaded for people to stop sending her AI videos of her father, stating that's \"not what he would have wanted.\"\nRecognition and legacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nYou can't look at any modern comic and say, \"That's the descendant of Robin Williams\", because it's not possible to be a Robin Williams rip-off... He raised the bar for what it's possible to do, and made an enormous amount of us want to be comedians.\nJudd Apatow\nAlthough Williams was first recognized as a stand-up comedian and television star, he became known for acting in film roles of substance and serious drama. Williams was considered a \"national treasure\" by many in the entertainment industry and by the public.\nWilliams's onstage energy and improvisational skill became a model for a new generation of stand-up comedians. Many comedians valued the way he worked highly personal issues into his comedy routines, especially his honesty about drug and alcohol addiction, along with depression. According to media scholar Derek A. Burrill, because of the openness with which Williams spoke about his own life, \"probably the most important contribution he made to pop culture, across so many different media, was as Robin Williams the person\".\nWilliams created a signature free-form comedy persona so widely and uniquely identified that new comedians like Jim Carrey impersonated him, paving the way for the growing comedy scene that developed in San Francisco. Young comedians felt more liberated on stage by seeing his spontaneously diverse range: \"One moment acting as a bright, mischievous child, then as a wise philosopher or alien from outer space\". According to Judd Apatow, the eclectic performer's rapid-fire improvisational style was an inspiration as well as an influence for other comedians, but his talent was so extremely unusual no one else could possibly attempt to copy it.\nWilliams's film performances often influenced other actors, both in and out of the film industry. Director Chris Columbus, who directed him in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\", says watching him work \"was a magical and special privilege. His performances were unlike anything any of us had ever seen, they came from some spiritual and otherworldly place.\" Looking over most of Williams's filmography, Alyssa Rosenberg at \"The Washington Post\" was \"struck by the breadth\" and radical diversity of most of his roles, writing that \"Williams helped us grow up\".\nComedic style.\nWilliams said that, partly due to the stress of performing stand-up, he started using drugs and alcohol early in his career. He further said that he neither drank nor took drugs while on stage, but occasionally performed when hung over from the previous day. During the period when he was using cocaine, Williams said it made him paranoid when performing on stage.\nWilliams once described the life of stand-up comedians as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's a brutal field, man. They burn out. It takes its toll. Plus, the lifestyle\u2014partying, drinking, drugs. If you're on the road, it's even more brutal. You gotta come back down to mellow your ass out, and then performing takes you back up. They flame out because it comes and goes. Suddenly they're hot, and then somebody else is hot. Sometimes they get very bitter. Sometimes they just give up. Sometimes they have a revival thing and they come back again. Sometimes they snap. The pressure kicks in. You become obsessed and then you lose that focus that you need.\nSome, such as the critic Vincent Canby, were concerned that Williams's monologues were so intense that it seemed as though, at any minute, his \"creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown\". His biographer, Emily Herbert, described Williams's \"intense, utterly manic style of stand-up [which sometimes] defies analysis... [going] beyond energetic, beyond frenetic... [and sometimes] dangerous... because of what it said about the creator's own mental state.\" Regarding the quick-fire delivery of his performance, Williams said, \"Usually, you start off performing in bars, where you can't really take your time, because people go: [\"mimics a drunk person\"] 'Oy, what are you doing now?' So I developed a style that was very much synaptic: quick-firing, moving, so that they never really had a chance to lock on as a target.\"\nWilliams felt secure that he would not run out of ideas, as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied. He also explained that he often used free association of ideas while improvising to keep the audience interested. The competitive nature of the show made things difficult. For example, some comedians said that Williams had stolen their jokes, which he strongly denied. David Brenner claimed that he confronted Williams's agent and threatened bodily harm if he heard him utter another one of his jokes. Whoopi Goldberg defended Williams, asserting that it is difficult for comedians not to reuse another comedian's material, and that it is done \"all the time\". Subsequently, he avoided going to performances of other comedians to deter similar accusations.\nDuring a \"Playboy\" interview in 1992, Williams was asked whether he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, \"There's that fear\u2014if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't speak, fire off or talk about things, if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something... If I stop trying, I get afraid.\" While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt that he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.\nInfluences.\nWilliams credited comedians, including Jonathan Winters, Peter Sellers, Nichols and May, and Lenny Bruce as influences, admiring their ability to attract a more intellectual audience with a higher level of wit. He also liked Jay Leno for his quickness in ad-libbing comedy routines, and Sid Caesar, whose acts he felt were \"precious\".\nJonathan Winters was his \"idol\" early in life; Williams, aged eight, first saw him on television and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career. Williams was inspired by Winters's ingenuity, saying \"that anything is possible, that anything is funny... He gave me the idea that it can be free-form, that you can go in and out of things pretty easily.\"\nDuring an interview in London in 2002, Williams told Michael Parkinson that Peter Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in \"Dr. Strangelove\", stating, \"It doesn't get better than that.\" British comedy actors Dudley Moore and Peter Cook were also among his influences, Williams told Parkinson.\nWilliams was also influenced by Richard Pryor's fearless ability to talk about his personal life onstage, with subjects that included his use of drugs and alcohol, and Williams added those kinds of topics during his own performances. By bringing up such personal matters as a form of comedy, Williams told Parkinson that it was \"cheaper than therapy\", and gave him a way to release his pent-up energy and emotions.\nActing credits and accolades.\nThroughout his career, Williams won numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997). He also won six Golden Globe Awards, including Best Actor\u2014Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his roles in \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" (1987), \"The Fisher King\" (1991), and \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" (1993), along with the Special Golden Globe Award for Vocal Work in a Motion Picture for his role Genie in \"Aladdin\" (1992), and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2005. Williams also received two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and five Grammy Awards.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

It has never been out of print. It comprises expanded and revised versions of two pamphlets that he wrote at the request of HM Treasury, \"Plain Words\" (1948) and \"ABC of Plain Words\" (1951). The aim of the book is to help officials in their use of English as a tool of their trade. To keep the work relevant for readers in subsequent decades it has been revised by Sir Bruce Fraser in 1973, by Sidney Greenbaum and Janet Whitcut in 1986, and by the original author's great-granddaughter Rebecca Gowers in 2014.\nAll the editions until that of 2014 were published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO). The most recent is issued by an imprint of Penguin Books.\nBackground.\nThe association of wordiness with bureaucracy has a long history. In the 14th century Geoffrey Chaucer, a prominent civil servant as well as a poet, urged the use of straightforward writing. Reviewing \"Plain Words\" in 1948, \"The Manchester Guardian\" quoted the French revolutionary Martial Herman writing in 1794:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe British civil service of the 19th and early 20th centuries had a reputation for pomposity and long-windedness in its written communications. In \"Little Dorrit\" in the mid-1850s, Charles Dickens caricatured officialdom as the \"Circumlocution Office\", where for even the most urgent matter nothing could be done without \"half a score of boards, half a bushel of minutes, several sacks of official memoranda, and a family-vault full of ungrammatical correspondence.\" By the 1880s the term \"officialese\" was in use, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as, \"The formal and typically verbose language considered characteristic of officials or official documents\".\nSir Ernest Gowers, a senior civil servant, was among those who wished to see officialese replaced by normal English. In 1929 he remarked in a speech about the civil service, \"It is said... that we revel in jargon and obscurity\". During the Second World War, with the role of government greatly expanded, official communications proliferated, and in Gowers's view were full of \"mistiness and grandiloquence\". He called for a new style of official writing, friendly in tone and easy to understand. His views came to the notice of the head of the civil service, Sir Edward Bridges, permanent secretary to the Treasury. After Gowers retired from the civil service at the end of the war, Bridges asked him to write a short pamphlet on good writing, for the benefit of the new generation of officials. Bridges called on his senior colleagues throughout the civil service to cooperate; some had already made efforts in the same cause, including the Inland Revenue, whose advice to staff included \"one golden rule to bear in mind always: that we should try to put ourselves in the position of our correspondent, to imagine his feelings as he writes his letters, and to gauge his reaction as he receives ours.\"\nGovernment departments sent Gowers many examples of officialese so extreme as to be amusing; a small committee of senior officials formed to help him and comment on his proposals. The colleague on whom Gowers most relied was Llewelyn Wyn Griffith of the Inland Revenue, whose contribution Gowers acknowledged in the prefaces to \"Plain Words\" and its two successors.\n\"Plain Words\", 1948.\nThe result of Gowers's work was \"Plain Words\", a 94-page booklet. It was judged successful by the civil service, and the Treasury considered that it should be made publicly available. Had Gowers written it as part of his duties while still a civil servant it would have automatically been Crown copyright, but as he had not begun it until after his retirement he owned the rights. The Treasury offered a flat fee of \u00a3500, but he successfully held out for a royalty on every copy sold. The government publisher, His Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO), issued the booklet for sale in April 1948. It was priced at two shillings (10 pence in British decimal currency); between April and Christmas 1948 it sold more than 150,000 copies and had to be reprinted seven times.\nReviewers responded favourably. \"The Times Literary Supplement\" praised the book and engaged in a little mock-officialese of its own: \"It deserves to be a 'best seller' (or perhaps we should say that in all the circumstances it may reasonably be anticipated that it will be found to evoke a relatively considerable demand on the part of the general public).\" \"The Times\" devoted a leader to the work, and concluded, \"for all its cool urbanity \"Plain Words\" is written with missionary zeal\". \"The Manchester Guardian\" considered that by commissioning \"Plain Words\" from Gowers \"the Treasury has put us all in its debt.\" \"The Economist\" commented, \"The Stationery Office must have enjoyed publishing this book. It is great fun to read\".\nOccasionally Gowers's humour misled literal-minded reviewers. \"The Daily Mail\", Harold Nicolson and the grammarian G H Vallins objected to the conspicuously un-plain words of Gowers's opening sentences:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The purpose of this book is to help officials in their use of written English. To some of them this may seem a work of supererogation, calculated only to place an unnecessary burden on a body of people already overburdened.\nWhen revising the text in preparation for \"The Complete Plain Words\", Gowers abandoned the joke, and rewrote the second sentence as, \"I suspect that this project may be received by many of them without any marked enthusiasm or gratitude.\" A substantive objection by Vallins to \"the cult of 'plain English'\" was his view that verbose phrases lose important nuances when reduced to plain words. He gave as an example \"evacuated to alternative accommodation\", which in his opinion has overtones that Gowers's \"taken to other houses\" lacks.\n\"ABC of Plain Words\", 1951.\nThe Treasury invited Gowers to build on the success of \"Plain Words\" by producing a second volume of advice on good, clear writing. As with its predecessor, he \"had many helpers to thank\", including Griffith and other civil service colleagues. He also drew on the works of well-known writers on English usage, including H W Fowler, A P Herbert and Eric Partridge. \"The ABC of Plain Words\" had 160 pages, and was priced at three shillings (15p).\nGowers explained the purpose of the new book in his preface, \"We must have something that can be kept on the desk and consulted on points of difficulty as they arise. \"Plain Words\" is of little use for that: it has not even an index\". The new work consisted of articles, mostly brief, on points of vocabulary, grammar, construction, punctuation and style, set out in alphabetical order, beginning with \"Abstract words\" and ending with \"Write\". The former was one of the longer entries, explaining the dangers of overuse of abstract words, and recommending concrete terms where possible. Thus, \"Was this the realisation of an anticipated liability?\" would be better as, \"Did you expect to have to do this?\" The entry on \"Write\" was an example of one of the short articles on particular words; it pointed out that \"I wrote to you about it\" needs the \"to\" but \"I wrote you a letter\" does not.\nGowers and his successors revised their advice as usage changed over the years. Two consecutive entries in \"The ABC\" illustrate how some comments have become dated and others have not: Gowers warned in 1951 that the word \"backlog\" meaning \"arrears\" would be unintelligible to British readers, and in the next entry he advised that the construction \"on a ... basis\" should be avoided. The latter remains a frequent feature of loose writing and all the editions of the \"Plain Words\" books retain and expand Gowers's advice, whereas within three years of writing \"The ABC\", Gowers noted in \"The Complete Plain Words\" that \"backlog\" was rapidly and usefully establishing itself in British usage.\nNeither the Treasury nor HMSO expected the second book to rival the popularity of its predecessor, but it sold nearly 80,000 copies in its first year. Gowers was nevertheless not wholly happy with it. He thought the A\u2013Z layout had two disadvantages. The first was that it gave the wrong impression that all the topics were of equal importance; the second was that the people most in need of advice would not think to look up the relevant entry: \"There is no reason why anyone addicted to abstract nouns, unconscious of any offence, should ever be prompted to read that article; nor can I think of any other title for it that would be more likely to throw it in his way.\"\n\"The Complete Plain Words\", 1954.\nBy 1954 both books were still selling well. Almost 300,000 copies of \"Plain Words\" and more than 130,000 of \"The ABC\" had been sold. The Treasury, HMSO and Gowers agreed that the obvious and best course would be to combine the two booklets into a single volume. This Gowers did, with help from his colleagues, as before; he made many revisions as a result of \"the many correspondents from all parts of the English-speaking world who have been good enough \u2026 to send me suggestions, criticisms and specimens\". An example of his revisions is in the entry on \"bottleneck\", of which in 1951 he had written four brief sentences warning against overuse: in 1954 he felt it necessary to write 270 words, so ubiquitous had the term become. (By the time of the 1973 revision the fad for the word had declined, and Fraser's entry is very much shorter.)\n\"The Complete Plain Words\" contained 226 pages, including seven pages of index. It was a hardback, in green cloth binding with dust-jacket, in HMSO's preferred size, used for the two earlier Plain Words books, 8.4in x 5.25in (21.3\u00a0cm x 13.3\u00a0cm). It was published in September 1954 at what \"The Manchester Guardian\" called the remarkably cheap price of five shillings (25p). \"The Times Literary Supplement\" greeted the publication: \"It may be hoped that in this more durable form the book's good influence will continue to spread: Civil Servants have not been alone in profiting from it in the past, nor should they be in the future.\" The book has remained in print, in its original and revised editions, ever since.\nBetween Gowers's prologue and epilogue there is a Digression on Legal English followed by chapters on The Elements, Correctness, Avoiding the Superfluous Word, Choosing the Familiar Word, Choosing the Precise Word, The Handling of Words, and Punctuation.\n1973 revision by Bruce Fraser.\nThe 1954 text was reprinted seven times during Gowers's lifetime, and he made a number of amendments in the various impressions. Changing times in the 1960s meant that a substantial revision was needed if the book was to continue to fulfil its purpose. Gowers, fully occupied for a decade in making the first revision of Fowler's \"Modern English Usage\", was unable to carry out the task; he died in 1966, a few months after the publication of the revised Fowler. Another retired senior civil servant, Bruce Fraser, was asked to revise \"The Complete Plain Words\". The new edition, 250 pages long, was published by HMSO at \u00a31, in hardback with black cloth binding and dust-jacket, in the same format as the first edition.\nFraser preserved Gowers's structure, and added three new chapters, the most important of which was titled \"Some recent trends\"; it covered the increasing prevalence of informality, and the influences of America, science, technology, economics, business, and personnel management. The final sections of the chapter were on \"vogue words\" and \"modish writing\". Fraser noted that though Gowers had said approvingly in 1954 that the use of the subjunctive was dying out, it was now, under the influence of American writing, making an unwelcome reappearance in English usage.\nReviewing the new edition in \"The Times Literary Supplement\", David Hunt commented of Fraser, \"his wit, perhaps a little drier and more Scottish, is equally acute, diverting and instructive\". In \"The Times\", Dennis Potter said that the book remained \"the happiest thing to come out of the Treasury\". He praised Fraser for replacing Gowers's dated examples of officialese with modern specimens and updating the text to reflect current trends, but concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Fraser edition was reprinted in hardback three times between 1973 and 1983. Penguin published a paperback version in the UK in 1973, and in the US in 1975.\n1986 revision by Sidney Greenbaum and Janet Whitcut.\nThe third edition was commissioned not by the Treasury but by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, to mark its bicentenary. The revision was made not by an experienced public servant but by an academic and a lexicographer, Sidney Greenbaum, Quain Professor of English Language and Literature at University College, London and Janet Whitcut, formerly senior research editor of the Longman Dictionary. They chose to revise Fraser's 1973 version rather than starting from Gowers's original. Having two authors made it necessary to abandon Gowers's frequent use of the first person; Fraser had retained it, stating \"...the reader may take it that 'I' means either 'Gowers agreed with by Fraser' or 'Fraser, confident that Gowers would agree with him'\". With joint authors for the new edition, this could not be sustained, and the change from first person to impersonal removed some of the book's previous character. An example is in the section on punctuation, where Gowers wrote, \"The author of the style-book of the Oxford University Press... says 'If you take hyphens seriously you will surely go mad'. I have no intention of taking hyphens seriously.\" In the new edition the second sentence read, \"You should not take hyphens seriously\". Rebecca Gowers objects that this approach \"systematically depersonalise[s] the writing\".\nThe new edition, in the same format as its two predecessors, is in blue cloth, with dust-jacket, and has 298 pages. A paperback version was issued by Penguin Books in 1987, and an American hardback edition was published in 1988 by Godine Publishing, Boston.\n2014 revision by Rebecca Gowers.\nThe last direct link between \"Plain Words\" and the public service was broken in 1996, when HMSO was dismembered under governmental privatisation policy. The 2014 edition of the book was published by Particular Books, an imprint of Penguin Books. It was printed on lower-weight paper and in a smaller format than its predecessors. The reviser was Rebecca Gowers, Ernest's great-granddaughter, a novelist and author of a non-fiction book about a Victorian murder. She begins the new edition with a twenty-page preface that includes a biographical sketch of Ernest Gowers and a history of the revisions after his death.\nUnlike the three earlier revisers, Rebecca Gowers generally avoids merging her own comments with the original text. Her practice is to retain Ernest Gowers's remarks and append updated observations in a separate note. An example is the entry on the use of the noun \"issue\". The original words were:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This word has a very wide range of proper meanings as a noun, and should not be made to do any more work \u2013 the work, for instance of \"subject\", \"topic\", \"consideration\" and \"dispute\".\nTo which the reviser has added:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Note\": The workload of \"issue\" has grown enormously since Gowers wrote this, not least because it now also doubles up on the job done by \"problem\". Thus a government department these days might release a disastrous consultation paper in terms of issues to do with interoperability issues, even as a Minister has personal issues that threaten to become an issue in the press, causing the Prime Minister to have a major issue with the Minister. In short, Gowers's warning went unheeded, and \"issue\" is being made to labour harder than ever.\nAlthough Fraser, Greenbaum and Whitcut remained broadly faithful to Gowers's original structure and chapter headings, with some minor changes, Rebecca Gowers reverts to the original almost exclusively. The modernisations she introduces, such as the consideration of gender-neutral language, are incorporated into the chapters of the 1954 book.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has an interpreter, developed in Smalltalk, which recognizes its own dialect of the BASIC programming language. It runs on 16- and 32-bit Windows and OS/2.\nBackground.\nLiberty BASIC was written by Carl \"Gunner\" Gundel and published in its first release by his company, Shoptalk Systems, in 1991. It has progressed steadily since then. The last published update[ [update]] to the software, version 4.5.1, was in June 2018.\nThough Liberty BASIC has its share of limitations in its design for advanced programming, it provides an introductory integrated development environment, IDE, for moderate to advanced users of Windows and OS/2. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) are available. In its current version, it runs only on Microsoft Windows, and under Wine on Linux. Alpha testing of Liberty BASIC v5.0 is underway with versions that run on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and on the Raspberry Pi as well.\nLiberty BASIC does not compile to native code. Instead it compiles the code written in the IDE to an encrypted file with the extension TKN. This file is then executed by an EXE file that carries the same file name, although this may change with the release of version 5.\nFeatures.\nDistinguishing features.\nLiberty BASIC allows for procedural programming using a default \"main window\" that displays formatted text and accepts user input. It also supports event-driven programming based on a graphical user interface, using several types of windows that may contain the standard controls such as buttons, menus, textboxes, etc.\nA central idea in creating Liberty BASIC was to model the handling of windows after the syntax for file handling. For example, (from the Liberty BASIC Help File):\n\"The OPEN command opens communication with a device, which can be a disk file, a window, a dynamic-link library or a serial communications port.\"\nOnce a \u201cdevice\u201d is open, data and also commands to control that device can be \u201cprinted\u201d to it. For each type of device there is a set of commands which can be sent to it in this way. In the more recent versions of LB the word \"print\" may be dropped from the \"print\" statement, making the syntax even simpler.\nSimplicity has been at the heart of Liberty BASIC from the beginning. This makes it easier to learn but at some cost, perhaps, in limiting functionality. Only two data types are supported in LB v4.03\u00a0\u2014 numeric and string. No type declarations are required; any variable with a $ sign at the end of its name is a string variable, otherwise it is numeric. (The plan for LB v5 is to support other types and user defined types as well as these.) For the purpose of making calls to an API or third-party DLLs there is a STRUCT and the additional types necessary for the DLL. The only other data structure supported is the ARRAY. Arrays of one or two dimensions are supported. LB v5 may support arrays of user-defined types.\nExample code.\nHere are some examples of the language:\n\"Hello, World!\" program:\nprint \"Hello, World!\"\nend\nProgram to display a pop-up message box with the words \"Hello, World!\" on it:\nnomainwin\nnotice \"Hello, World!\"\nend\nnomainwin\nnotice \"Example program\" + CHR$(13) + \"Hello, World!\"\nend\nProgram to display an input box:\nnomainwin\nprompt \"Enter your name:\"; response$\nnotice \"Response:\" + CHR$(13) + response$\nend\nRunning another application:\nnomainwin\nrun \"notepad.exe\"\nend\nPrinting multiplication table of 5 on form:\n[multi]\n for i = 1 to 15\n res = 5 * i\n print res\n next i\nend\nAlternative implementations.\nThe GNU/Liberty Basic Compiler Collection (GLBCC), by Anthony Liguori, is a set of tools to compile Liberty Basic programs, runs on Windows and Linux systems, but the project has not been updated since 2001.\nIn 2012 an alternative Windows implementation of Liberty BASIC, LB Booster (LBB), became available. Although substantially compatible with the Liberty BASIC 4 language syntax, LBB was developed entirely independently by Richard Russell and is written in BBC BASIC.\nLBB offers (typically) increased execution speed, smaller self-contained executables and some additional capabilities. However LBB is not 100% compatible with LB4 and while many programs will run without modification, some may need to be adapted, or may even be unsuitable for running under LBB.\nLiberty Basic does not provide for data declarations. Instead any new data name is treated as a new declaration. Some regard this as a benefit, others see it as a debugging issue for imperfect typers. In 2019 Peter J. D. Matthews devised a method for adding declarations and checking for undeclared data - without changing the code seen by the LB interpreter.

{"id": "53253", "revid": "1180109957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53253", "title": "Balducci levitation", "text": "Levitation illusion\nThe Balducci levitation is a levitation illusion first described by Ed Balducci. Its inventor is unknown. It is an impromptu magic trick, which has been popularized by many magicians, such as David Roth, Paul Harris, and David Blaine.\nEffect.\nThe performer stands at an angle facing away from the spectators. The performer appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. The effect generally does not last for more than five seconds. The performer's feet return to the ground, and the effect is complete.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nOther methods of levitation allow for greater heights, longer durations, and better viewing angles (see definition of angles from List of conjuring terms) for performance; however, most of these methods can only be performed on a stage because they require special equipment or setups (such as wires). The Balducci levitation requires no preparation of any kind, and so it can be performed impromptu \u2013 anytime, anywhere. Although variations have been made to improve the illusion of genuine levitation, they are generally harder to perform, and some require gimmicks or setups that make them less practical than the Balducci levitation.\nMisdirection.\nLike many magic effects, this illusion relies mostly on subtle misdirection and acting on the part of the performer.\nThese psychological subtleties increase the probability that spectators will believe the illusion:\nThese physical subtleties make the levitation seem more amazing:\nThe effects of these subtleties can be seen in David Blaine's television performances of this illusion. For example, one spectator is asked how high Blaine levitated. She gestures a height that is obviously a few inches higher than the illusion is capable of producing, demonstrating that subtleties can often cause a spectator's interpretation of an effect to be better than the effect itself.\nMethod.\nThe magician positions themself at an angle to their audience, a little distance away, in such a way that the audience can only see the rearward portion of one foot and most of the other foot\u00a0\u2013 concealing the toe end of the \"far\" (upstage) foot. The audience group must be small enough that they can be grouped close together. The magician, with the rearward portion of their feet held together, lifts the \"near\" foot off the ground, standing on only the front part of their \"far\" foot (the one which is partially concealed) while lifting the rearward part of the \"far\" foot and all of the \"near\" foot and keeping their ankles together. The audience sees only one foot and the heel of the other (the \"far\" foot), which appear to rise off the floor. The hidden part of the \"far\" (upstage) foot supports the weight of the magician as they appear to levitate one or two inches.\nSimply put: the magician stands on the front of one foot, while raising the one foot and the visible part of the other foot, blocking the view of the front of the supporting foot with the other foot and rear part of the supporting foot.\nThe \"reverse Balducci\" illusion is similar to the Balducci illusion, but the magician faces towards the audience at a 90-degree angle rather than facing away. The magician slowly stands on the heel of their \"far\" foot as they lift the \"near\" foot and the front of the \"far\" foot. To improve the appearance of the effect, the magician will try to maintain the near foot parallel to the ground.\nAnother variation that is sometimes shown on TV shows is done by performing a normal \"Balducci\", filming the audience reaction, then later returning and performing the illusion with the aid of wires to get more height or to get a shot from the front or underneath. These shots will be edited into the footage of the original performance, thus allowing the levitation effect to be exaggerated, while still using genuine onlookers in the shot.\nThere is a principle in theatrical magic that \"the audience will often remember or describe an exaggerated effect\"\u00a0\u2013 so the audience members may not notice the increased height caused by the \"faked second shot\" (if the additional height is not more than a few extra centimeters) when watching the combined footage later, believing that they are seeing a genuine recreation of the performance. This is even more likely if, during the original performance, cameras are positioned in the same place as those from which the \"faked\" footage was later shot.\nHistory.\nEd Balducci published the first known description of the illusion in July 1974 in \"The Pallbearer's Review\" (Volume 9, Number 9, pp 755) under the name \"Impromptu Levitation\". Balducci ended his description by saying, \"Originator unknown. It was shown to me many years ago by one of the Harmonicats, a cousin of mine, Erwin Levine, known as the Baron.\"\nDespite Balducci's disclaimer, the illusion has since been known as the \"Balducci levitation\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The recorded history of Sardinia begins with its contacts with the various people who sought to dominate western Mediterranean trade in classical antiquity: Phoenicians, Punics and Romans. Initially under the political and economic alliance with the Phoenician cities, it was partly conquered by Carthage in the late 6th century BC and then entirely by Rome after the First Punic War (230 BC). The island was included for centuries in the Roman province of Sardinia and Corsica, which would be incorporated into the diocese of \"Italia suburbicaria\" in 3rd and 7th centuries.\nIn the Early Middle Ages, through the European barbarian movements, the waning of the Byzantine Empire influence in the western Mediterranean and the Saracen raids, the island fell out of the sphere of influence of any higher government; this led to the birth of four independent kingdoms called \"Judicates\" (Latin: \"Judicati\"; Sardinian: \"Judicados\") in the 8th through 10th centuries. Falling under papal influence, Sardinia became the focus of the rivalry of Genoa, Pisa, and the Crown of Aragon, which eventually subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324. The Iberian Kingdom was to last until 1718, when it was ceded to the House of Savoy; from Piedmont, the Savoyards pursued a policy of expansion to the rest of the Italian peninsula, having their Kingdom of Sardinia be later renamed into \"Kingdom of Italy\" in 1861.\nPrehistory.\nThe oldest trace in Sardinia of the anthropomorphic prehistoric primate called \"Oreopithecus bambolii\" is dated to 8.5 million years ago. In 1996 a hominid finger bone, dated up to 250.000 BC, was found in a cave in the Logudoro region.\nModern humans appeared in the island during the Upper Paleolithic, a phalanx dated to 18000 BC had been found in the \"Corbeddu cave\", near Oliena. Mesolithic human remains had been discovered at \"Su Coloru cave\" of Laerru but also in the south (Sirri, Arbus).\nAlready in the Stone Age, Monte Arci played an important role. The old volcano was one of the central places where obsidian was found and worked for cutting tools and arrowheads. Even now the volcanic glass can be found on the sides of the mountain.\nThe Neolithic began in Sardinia in the 6th millennium BC with the Cardial culture. Later, important cultures like the Ozieri culture and the Arzachena culture of the late Neolithic and the Abealzu-Filigosa and Monte Claro culture of the Chalcolithic period, developed in the island contemporaneously with the appearance of the megalithic phenomenon.\nThe dolmens culture, around the end of the 3rd millennium BC, passed with other typical material aspects of Western Europe (e.g. Bell Beaker) through by the Sardinian coast even in Sicily.\nPrehistoric and Pre-nuragic monuments and constructions that characterise the Sardinian landscapes are the Domus de Janas (), the menhir and Statue menhir and the dolmens.\nChronology of Pre-Nuragic Sardinia.\nArcheological cultures of Sardinia in the pre-Nuragic period:\nNuragic period.\nBronze Age Sardinia is characterised by stone structures called nuraghes, of which there are more than 8,000. The most famous is the complex of Barumini in the province of Medio Campidano. The nuraghes were mainly built in the period from about 1800 to 1200 BC, though many were used until the Roman period. Characteristics of this period are also the holy well temples (for example Santa Cristina, Paulilatino), the megara temples and the Giants' graves.\nThe Nuragic Sards also produced a vast collection of bronze statuettes and the so-called giants of Mont'e Prama, which might constitute the first anthropomorphic statues of Europe.\nIt is known that the Sardinians had contact with the Myceneans, who traded with the western Mediterranean. Contact with powerful cities of Crete, such as Kydonia, is clear from pottery recovered in archaeological excavations in Sardinia. The alleged connection with the Sherden, one of the sea peoples who invaded Egypt and other areas of eastern Mediterranean, has been supported by scholars like the professor Giovanni Ugas from the University of Cagliari; this hypothesis has been however opposed by other archaeologists and historians.\nThe name of the island could result from \"Sardus\" (known amongst the Romans as \"Sardus Pater\"), a mythological hero of the Nuragic pantheon.\nEarly and classical antiquity.\nPhoenician settlement.\nFrom the 8th century BC, Phoenicians founded several cities and strongholds on strategic points in the south and west of Sardinia, often peninsulas or islands near estuaries, easy to defend and natural harbours, such as Tharros, Bithia, Sulci, Nora and Caralis (Cagliari). The majority of the inhabitants in these cities were of indigenous nuragic stock while the Phoenician element was, although culturally predominant, in minority. The Phoenicians came originally from what is now Lebanon and founded a vast trading network in the Mediterranean. Sardinia had a special position because it was central in the Western Mediterranean between Carthage, Spain, the river Rh\u00f4ne and the Etruscan civilization area. The mining area of the Iglesiente was important for the metals lead and zinc. After the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians took over control in this part of the Mediterranean, around 510 BC, after which a first attempt of conquest of the island in 540 BC ended in failure. They expanded their influence to the western and southern coast from Bosa to Caralis, consolidating the existing Phoenician colonies, administered by plenipotentiaries called \"Suffetes\", and founding new ones such as Olbia, Cornus and Neapolis; Tharros probably became the capital of the province. Carthage stressed the growing of grain and cereals and prohibited fruit trees.\nTharros, Nora, Bithia, Monte Sirai etc. are now important archaeological monuments where architecture and city planning can be studied.\nRoman Republic and Empire.\nIn 240 BC, in the course of the First Punic War, the Carthaginian mercenaries on the island revolted and gave the Romans, who some years earlier had defeated the Carthaginians in the naval battle of Sulci, the opportunity to land on Sardinia and occupy it. In 238 BC the Romans took over the whole island, without meeting any resistance. They took over an existing developed infrastructure and urbanized culture (at least in the plains). Along with Corsica it formed the province of Corsica et Sardinia, under a praetor. Together with Sicily it formed one of the main granaries of Rome until the Romans conquered Egypt in the 1st century BC.\nA revolt, led by two Sardo-Punic notables from Cornus and Tharros, Hampsicora and Hanno, broke out after the crushing Roman defeat at Cannae (216 BC). A Roman army of 22,000 infantrymen and 1,200 cavalry, under Titus Manlius Torquatus, reached Sardinia landing in Caralis and defeating Hiostus, the son of Hampsicora, near Milis. The Romans then met the Carthaginian-Sardinian allied forces in the south of the island, defeating them in a pitched battle that took place between Sestu and Decimomannu, and killing 12,000 men. Another major revolt took place in 177-176 BC when the Balares and the Ilienses were defeated by Tiberius Gracchus, who, according to Livy, killed or enslaved about 80,000 natives. The last organized revolts were repressed by Marcus Caecilius Metellus in 115-111 BC and Titus Albucius in 106. However the Sardinians living in the impervious mountains of the interior resisted the Roman colonization well into Imperial times.\nPunic culture remained strong during the first centuries of the Roman domination. However, in the long run, Romanization prevailed, and Latin became the speech of the majority of the inhabitants, ultimately developing into the modern Sardinian language. The Roman religion began to spread among Sardinians as well. Caralis, the provincial capital, Nora and Sulci obtained the status of Municipium within the 1st century AD and a Roman colony named Turris Libissonis (Porto Torres) was founded in the north-west while the village of Usellus become perphans a Roman colony under Trajan. Four great roads were built: two along the coasts and two in the interior connecting all the major cities.\nDuring the Roman period, the geographer Ptolemy noted that Sardinia was inhabited by the following tribes, from north to south: the Tibulati and the Corsi, the Coracenses, the Carenses and the Cunusitani, the Salcitani and the Lucuidonenses, the \u00c6saronenses, the \u00c6chilenenses (also called Cornenses), the Rucensi, the Celsitani and the Corpicenses, the Scapitani and the Siculensi, the Neapolitani and the Valentini, the Solcitani and the Noritani.\nIn the year 212 AD, every inhabitant of the empire became a Roman citizen by the Constitutio Antoniniana, better known as the \"Edict of Caracalla\". At that time, many islanders from the \"Municipia\" and \"Coloniae\" were Roman citizens, while those living in the interior were not. Around the year 286 AD, Sardinia was incorporated into the Italian diocese during the empire of Diocletianus, and in 324 AD, under the rule of the emperor Constantine the Great, in the \"suburbicaria\" Italian diocese, until the conquest by the Vandals in 456 AD.\nMiddle Ages.\nVandals, Goths and Byzantines.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Sardinia was subject to several conquests. In 456, the Vandals, an East Germanic tribe, coming from North Africa, occupied the coastal cities of the island; they imposed garrisons guarded by African auxiliaries, like the Mauri. The Vandals followed Arianism and deported a number of African Bishops in the island such as Fulgentius of Ruspe. In 533, Sardinia rebelled under the Vandal governor Godas, a Goth, who proclaimed himself \"rex\" of Sardinia, asking the Byzantines for aid.\nIn the summer of 533 Vandal forces (5,000 men and 120 ships), led by Tzazo, arrived in Sardinia to stifle Godas' rebellion and conquered Caralis, killing Godas and his followers. In early 534, the Vandals of Sardinia surrendered immediately to the Byzantines when faced with news of the Vandal collapse in Africa; thenceforth the island was part of the Byzantine Empire, included as a province in the Praetorian prefecture of Africa. The local governor sat in Caralis. During the Gothic Wars, much of the island fell easily to the Ostrogoths, but the final fall of the Germanic resistance in mainland Italy reassured Byzantine control. Sardinia was subsequently included in the Exarchate of Africa until its end by the Arabs in 698 AD, when the island was likely aggregated to the Exarchate of Ravenna. In 599 and during the 7th century, the Longobard fleet tried to attack Caralis and Turris Libissonis (Porto Torres), but in vain.\nOne of the few ethnic Sardinians known from this period was Ospitone, a leader of the \"Barbaricinos\" (people of Barbagia). According to the Pope Gregory I's letters, a Romanized and Christianized area existed on the island (that of the \"provinciales\") that co-existed with, in the interior, pagan or semi-pagan cultures (\"Gens Barbaricina\"). The ruler of one of the latter, Ospitone, converted to Christianity in 594 after a diplomatic exchange. Christianization however remained long influenced by eastern and Byzantine culture.\nOther known religious figures of Sardinian origin of that period (5th\u20136th centuries) are Pope Hilarius and Pope Symmachus.\nIberian invasions.\nStarting from the 8th century, the Iberians from Denia and Zaragoza (recently conquered by Muslims) harassed the population of the coastal cities. Details about the political situation of Sardinia in the following centuries are scarce. Due to Saracen attacks, in the 9th century Tharros was abandoned in favor of Oristano, after more than 1,800 years of human occupation while Caralis was abandoned in favor of Santa Igia; numerous other coastal centres suffered the same fate (Nora, Sulci, Bithia, Cornus, Bosa, Olbia etc.). There was another Denia invasion in 1015\u221216 from Balearics, led by Muj\u0101hid al-\u02bf\u0100mir\u012b (Latinized as \"Museto\"), the Denians attempt of invasion of the island was stopped by Sardinian Judicates with the support of the Fleets of the Maritime Republics of Pisa and Genoa, called by Pope Benedict VIII.\nJudicates (Judicados).\nFrom the mid-11th century the Judicates (\"held by judges\") appeared. The title of \"Judex\" (judge, \"judike\" in medieval Sardinian) was an heir of that of the Byzantine governor after the creation of the Exarchate of Africa in 582 (\"Prases\" or \"Judex Provinciae\"). In the 8th and 9th centuries the four \"partes\" depending from Caralis grew increasingly independent, after that Byzantium was totally cut off from the Tyrrhenian Sea by the Muslim conquest of Sicily in 827. A letter from Pope Nicholas I in 864 mentions for the first time the Sardinian judges, and their autonomy is clear in a later letter by Pope John VIII, which defined them as \"Princes\". A letter by Mieszko I to Pope John XV proves that the Judicates were known even in Poland, and that they played a prestigious role in medieval Europe.\nDuring the judicial era Sardinia had some 300.000 inhabitants, of which slightly more than 1/3 were free. These were subjected to the authority of local \"curators\" (administrators), in turn subjected to the judge (who also administered justice and was the commander of the army). The church was also powerful, and at this time it had completely abandoned the Eastern Rite. The late 11th-century arrival of Benedictine, Camaldolese and other monks from the Italian Mezzogiorno, Lombardy and Provence, especially the monasteries of Montecassino, Saint-Victor de Marseille and Vallombrosa, boosted the agriculture in a land which was extremely underdeveloped. The \"condaghes\" (catalogues, cartularies) of the monasteries, which record property transactions, are an important source for the study of the island and its language in the 11th and 12th centuries. Evidence from the \"condaghes\" of San Pietro di Silki, in Sassari, and Santa Maria di Bonarcado concerning the children of slaves has been adduced to show that differences in agricultural lifestyles between regions may affect the survival rate of females, hypothetically through increased infanticide of baby girls. The abbacy of Santa Maria di Bonarcado contained more central, upland regions where a pastoral economy dominated and women were less economically useful; among children in that region, sex ratios are highly skewed in favour of men. On the other hand, in the region of San Pietro di Silki, less pastoral, child sex ratios are not skewed abnormally.\nThere were four (historically known) Judicates: Logudoro (or Torres), Cagliari (or Pluminos), Arborea and Gallura. Cagliari and Arborea and Logudoro (and perhaps Gallura) were united for a time in the 11th century.\nThe initiatives of the Gregorian reformers led to greater contact between Sardinia and the Italian peninsula, especially through the desires of the judges to establish monasteries with monks from continental monasteries at Montecassino and Marseille. By the 12th century, the Sardinian Judicates, though obscure, are visible through the mists of time. They professed allegiance to the Holy See, which put them under the authority of the Archdiocese of Pisa, superseding the ancient primacy of the Archdiocese of Cagliari on the island.\nOften quarreling between one another, the Judicates made a great number of commercial concessions to the Pisans and the Genoese. The Repubbliche Marinare soon became the true masters of the Sardinian economy.\nIn the late 12th and early 13th centuries, all four Judicates passed to foreign dynasties and the local families were relegated to minor positions. Arborea passed to the Catalan House of Cervera (Cervera-Bas) in 1185, though this was contested for the next few decades. In 1188, Cagliari was conquered by the House of Massa from the Republic of Pisa. Gallura became by marriage \u2013 it had been inherited by a woman, Elena \u2013 a possession of the House of Visconti, another Pisan family, in 1207. Only Logudoro survived to the end under local Sardinian rulers. However, its end was early. It passed to Genoa and to the Doria and Malaspina families in 1259 after the death of its last judge, Adelasia. Only a year before the others Judicates and the Pisans besieged Santa Igia and deposed the last ruler of Cagliari William III. Gallura survived longer, but the enemies of the Visconti in Pisa soon removed the last judge, Nino, a friend of Dante Alighieri, in 1288.\nAbout the same time, Sassari declared itself a free commune allied to Genoa. In the early 14th century, much of Eastern and Southern Sardinia, including Castel di Castro (Cagliari), was under the authority of Pisa and of the della Gherardesca family, who founded the important mining town of Villa di Chiesa (now Iglesias). Arborea, however, survived as the only indigenous kingdom until 1420. One of the most remarkable Sardinian figure of the Middle Ages, Eleanor of Arborea, was co-ruler of that region in the late 14th century; she laid the foundations for the laws that remained valid until 1827, the Carta de Logu.\nKingdom of Sardinia.\nKingdom of Sardinia in the Crown of Aragon and in the Spanish Empire.\nIn 1323 an Aragonese army, under Alfonso, son of King James II, disembarked near Palma di Sulcis, in Southern Sardinia. After the fall of Villa di Chiesa the Pisans were defeated again, both by land and sea, at Lucocisterna and in the gulf of Cagliari, and were forced to leave the island, maintaining only Castel di Castro until 1326. The Cagliari area as well as Gallura thus became part of the first nucleus of the Kingdom of Sardinia, established nominally by Pope Boniface VIII in 1297, that was included in the Crown of Aragon.\nIn 1353 Marianus IV of Arborea, allied with the Doria family, waged war against the Aragonese, occupying much of the island but unable to capture Cagliari. The Peace of Sanluri (1355) ushered in a period of tranquility, but hostilities were resumed in 1365, with Arborea, led by Marianus IV and then, from 1391, by Brancaleone Doria, initially able to capture much of the Island. However, in 1409 the Aragonese crushed a Genoese fleet coming in support the Sardinians, and destroyed the Judicial army at the Battle of Sanluri. Oristano, the Arborean capital, fell on 29 March 1410. William II of Narbonne, the last Judge of Arborea, sold his remaining territories to the Aragonese in 1420, in exchange for 100,000 gold florins.\nIn the 1470s an important revolt against the Aragonese was led by Leonardo Alagon, marquess of Oristano, who managed to defeat the viceroyal army but was later crushed at the Battle of Macomer (1478). The island endured attacks from North African pirates and a series of plagues in 1582, 1652 and 1655.\nIn 1527, during the Franco-Spanish War, a French army of 4000 men led by the Italian Renzo da Ceri attacked the north of the island, besieging Castellaragonese and sacking Sorso and then Sassari for almost a month.\nIn 1566 the first typography of Sardinia was established in Cagliari, while in 1607 and 1617 were founded the University of Cagliari and the University of Sassari.\nIn the late 15th and in the early 16th century the Spaniards built watchtowers all along the coast (today called \"Spanish towers\") to protect the island against Ottoman incursions. In 1637 a French fleet led by Henri, Count of Harcourt sacked Oristano for about a week.\nKingdom of Sardinia under the House of Savoy.\nSardinia was disputed between 1700 and 1720. After the War of the Spanish Succession it was assigned to Emperor Charles VI in 1714, Philip V of Spain briefly recovered the island in 1717, but in 1720 the European powers assigned Sicily to Charles VI and Sardinia to the House of Savoy, so Vittorio Amedeo II became the King of Sardinia.\nIn 1793 Sardinians twice defeated the French invaders (French expedition to Sardinia). On 23 February 1793, Domenico Millelire, in command of the Sardinian fleet, defeated near the Maddalena archipelago the fleets of the French Republic, which included with the rank of lieutenant, the young and future Emperor of France Napoleon Bonaparte. Millelire received the first Gold Medal of Military Valor of the Italian Navy. In the same month, Sardinians stopped the attempted French landing on the beach of Quartu Sant'Elena, near the Capital of Cagliari. Because of these successes, the representatives of nobility and clergy (\"Stamenti\") formulated five requests addressed to the King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia in order to have the same rights as the Italian mainlanders, but they met with a refusal. Because of this discontent, on 28 April 1794, during an uprising in Cagliari, two Piedmontese officials were killed. That was the start of a revolt (called the \"Moti rivoluzionari sardi\" or \"Vespri sardi\") all over the island, which culminated on 28 April 1794 (commemorated today as \"sa die de sa Sardigna\") with the expulsion of the officers for a few days from the capital Cagliari. On 28 December 1795, insurgents in Sassari demonstrating against feudalism, mainly from the region of Logudoro, occupied the city. On 13 February 1796, in order to prevent the spread of the revolt, the viceroy Filippo Vivalda gave to the Sardinian magistrate Giovanni Maria Angioy the role of Alternos, which meant a substitute of the viceroy himself. Angioy moved from Cagliari to Sassari, and during his journey almost all the villages joined the uprising, demanding an end to feudalism and aiming to declare the island to be an independent republic, but once he was outnumbered by loyalist forces he fled to Paris and sought support from the French to invade Sardinia and make it an independent Republic.\nIn 1799 King Charles Emmanuel IV was ousted from Piedmont by the French army, and moved his court to Cagliari (his brother and successor Victor Emmanuel I returned to Turin only in 1814). At the end of the 18th century, the Universities of Sassari and Cagliari were restored. In 1820, the Savoyards imposed the \"Enclosures Act\" (\"editto delle chiudende\") on the island, a legislative act which turned the land's traditional collective ownership, a cultural and economic cornerstone of Sardinia since the Nuragic times, into private property. This gave rise to many abuses, as the reform favoured the landholders while excluding the poor Sardinian farmers and shepherds, who witnessed the abolition of the communal rights and the sale of the land. Many local rebellions like the Nuorese \"Su Connottu\" (\"The Already Known\" in Sardinian) riot in 1868, all repressed by the King's army, resulted in an attempt to return to the past and reaffirm the right to use the once common land.\nIn 1847, under King Charles Albert, all the administrative differences between Sardinia and the Italian mainland were abolished through the so-called Perfect fusion: this manoveur had been presented as the only possible way to grant equal rights to all inhabitants of the Kingdom, which would become a unitary state and the basic legislation of the future united Italy as well.\nNew urban plans and new villages (for example Carloforte, Calasetta and Santa Teresa di Gallura) were realised between the 18th and the 19th centuries. They often followed the urban model of Turin, which now was the capital of the Reign of Italy. New infrastructures were built under King Carlo Felice. The main road from the south (Cagliari) to the north (Sassari) was enhanced (the road still exists today and it still bears the name of Carlo Felice). Also, the first ferry route between the island and Genoa was established, using steamboats such as the Gulnara. The first railway was inaugurated in 1871. By the end of the 19th century the Royal Railways had received 30 locomotives, 106 passenger cars, and 436 cargo cars.\nThe economy was focused mainly on the primary sector (agriculture and sheep husbandry) and on mining. The majority of mining societies operating in Sardinia depended on non-Sardinian capital money. However, in 1848 the Sardinian entrepreneur Giovanni Antonio Sanna achieved the property of the mine of Montevecchio, thus becoming the 3rd richest man of the Kingdom.\nUnited Italy.\nKingdom of Italy.\nMost Sardinian forests were cut down at this time, in order to provide the Piedmontese with raw materials, like wood, used to make railway sleepers on the mainland. The extension of primary natural forests, praised by every traveller visiting Sardinia, would in fact be reduced to little more than 100,000 hectares at the end of the century.\nWith the Unification of Italy in 1861, the Kingdom of Sardinia became the Kingdom of Italy. Since 1855 the national hero Giuseppe Garibaldi bought most of the island of Caprera in the Maddalena archipelago, where he moved because of the loss of his home town of Nice. His house, farm and tomb are now the most visited Sardinian museum (\"Compendio Garibaldino\").\nIn 1883 the first train travelled between Cagliari and Sassari, and in these decades were made all the modern public works: roads, dams, schools, sewers and aqueducts, mainly in the cities.\nDuring the First World War the Sardinian soldiers of the Brigata Sassari distinguished themselves, with several being decorated with gold medals and other honours. Following the war, in occasion of Irish independence the ex-combatants organized themselves into a Sardinian nationalist movement, the Sardinian Action Party, but was eventually outlawed in 1926. In 1924, the Italian Parliament led by Benito Mussolini passed a bill (called \"la legge del miliardo\") to establish a budget of one billion \"lire\" to develop infrastructure in order to encourage economic development. However, only a portion of the designated funds were ever distributed, and mainly in Cagliari.\nThe writer Grazia Deledda won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1926.\nDuring the Fascist period, with the implementation of the policy of autarky, several swamps around the island were drained and new agrarian communities founded. The main communities were in the area of Oristano, where the village of Mussolinia (now called Arborea), populated by people from Veneto and Friuli, was located, and in the area adjacent the city of Alghero, within the region of Nurra, where Fertilia was built, settled, after the World War II, by Istrians and Dalmatians from Yugoslavia. Also established during that time was the city of Carbonia, which became the main centre of mining activity. Works to drain the numerous waste lands and the growth of mining activities favoured the arrival of numerous settlers and immigrants from the Mainland.\nThe repression by the Fascist regime of its opponents within the region was ruthless. Rural Sardinia showed little interest in the Fascist state, while the urban bourgeoisie from the cities, some of which being repopulated by Italian mainlanders, were its staunchest supporters on the island. Antonio Gramsci, one of the founders of Italian Communist Party, was arrested and died in prison. The anarchist Michele Schirru was executed after a failed assassination plot against Benito Mussolini.\nDuring World War II Sardinia was a theatre of bombing; from 1940 the Axis used its airfields for attacks across the Mediterranean, while from 1943 the island was under air attack from the Allies and the cities of Cagliari and Alghero were heavily bombed. (Air raids had also been conducted by an aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy in September 1940, shortly after Italy's entry into the war.) German troops were stationed on Sardinia and Corsica \u2013 occupied by the Italians \u2013 in 1943. By that July, most airbases in Sardinia had been rendered inoperable by Allied aerial bombing. A number of diversionary raids on Sardinia, Operation Hawthorn, were carried out by the Allies in summer 1943 to distract Axis attention from the upcoming invasion of Sicily, Operation Husky. Operation Mincemeat was an elaborate diversion implemented by the Allies to persuade the Axis's intelligence that their planned invasion of southern Europe would take place in the Balkans and Italy and would feature an invasion of Sardinia. This succeeded in diverting Axis troops from Sicily, the real target of the invasion.\nThe war ended in Sardinia in September 1943, with the withdrawal of the Wehrmacht to Corsica following the surrender of Italy to the Allies under the Armistice of Cassibile, and the island, together with Southern Italy, became free. Allied forces landed on Sardinia on 14 September 1943 and the last German troops were expelled on the 18th.\nItalian Republic and Sardinian autonomy.\nIn 1946 more than 60% of Sardinians voted in favour of monarchy, just as much as in Southern Italy, but a few days later Italy became a Republic. In 1948 Sardinia obtained the status of autonomous region which, while being the highest degree of self-governance since the Judicates era, fell short of many Sardinians' expectations. The first regional elections were held on 8 May 1949. By 1951, malaria was successfully eliminated with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation. In the same years the Italian economic miracle led to the birth of Sardinian tourist \"boom\", mainly focused on beach holidays and luxury tourism, such as in Costa Smeralda. Today about ten million people visit the island every year.\nWith the increase in tourism, coal decreased in importance. However, shortly after the Second World War a ponderous industrialization effort was commenced, the so-called \"Piani di Rinascita\" (Rebirth Plans), with the initiation of major infrastructure projects on the island. This included the realization of new dams and roads, reforestation, agricultural zones on reclaimed marsh land, and large industrial complexes (primarily oil refineries and related petrochemical operations). These efforts to create jobs have largely failed due to the high costs of transportation that could not compensate the cheap labor. In the 1950s and 1960s many Sardinians migrated to Northern and Central Italy (Lombardy, Piedmont, Liguria, Tuscany and Rome) and the rest of Europe (mostly in Germany, France and Belgium) but also from the interior of the island to the coastal cities of Cagliari, Olbia and Sassari. In the early 1960s with the creation of petrochemical industries, thousands of ex-farmers became specialised workers, and some others would commence to work on the newly established military bases, created primarily for the NATO. Even now, around 60% of all Italian and US military installations in Italy are on Sardinia, whose area is less than one-tenth of all the Italian territory and whose population is little more than the 2,5%; furthermore, they comprise over 35.000 hectares used for experimental weapons testing, where 80% of the military explosives in Italy are used. Ever since, there has always been a local protest movement expressing deep concern over the environmental degradation the military activities would cause.\nNevertheless, since 1973 the international oil crisis caused the firing of thousands of workers employed in the petrochemical industry. Especially because of the failed industrialization plans, Sardinia is actually the most polluted region in Italy, with over 445,000 hectares of contaminated soil still to be remediated.\nAmong other factors, economic crisis and unemployment aggravated the crime rate, as evidenced by the increasing frequency of phenomena such as kidnappings and political subversion of the Anonima sarda: between the 1970s and the early 1980s, some communist and nationalist militant groups, the most famous being \"Barbagia Rossa\" and the Sardinian Armed Movement (MAS), claimed several terrorist attempts. In the span of just two years (1987\u20131988), 224 bombing attacks were reported.\nIn 1983, for the first time ever a militant of a nationalist party, the Sardinian Action Party (\"Partidu Sardu\"-\"Partito Sardo d'Azione\"), was elected president of the regional parliament. Nevertheless, in the 1980s a number of even more radical pro-independence movements were born, some even managing to evolve into parties in the 1990s. In 1999, after a long period of Italian assimilation policies in Sardinia, the languages indigenous to the island were eventually recognized as \"historical language minorities\" of the Country, and allowed to formally enjoy co-official status alongside Italian.\nAlso noticeable is the difference between coastal regions and the inland. Coastal regions have always been more open to outside influences. Nowadays Sardinia is most known for its coasts (La Maddalena, Costa Smeralda), the north-western coast near Sassari (Alghero, Stintino, Castelsardo) and Cagliari, because these are easily reachable by ship and by plane.\nToday Sardinia is a phasing-in EU region, featured by a diversified economy, mainly focused on tourism and the tertiary. The economic efforts of last twenty years have reduced the supposed handicap of insularity, for example with low cost air companies and information and informatic technologies, thanks to the CRS4 (Center for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia). The CRS4 developed the first Italian website, and invented the webmail, in 1995, that brought to the birth of several telecommunication companies and internet service providers based on the island, such as Video On Line (1993), Tiscali (1998) and Andala UMTS (1999).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53255", "revid": "48248246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53255", "title": "Jacques Derrida", "text": "French philosopher (1930\u20132004)\nJacques Derrida (; ; born Jackie \u00c9lie Derrida; 15 July 1930 \u2013 9 October 2004) was a French philosopher. He developed the philosophy of deconstruction, which he utilized in a number of his texts, and which was developed through close readings of the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure and Husserlian and Heideggerian phenomenology. He is one of the major figures associated with post-structuralism and postmodern philosophy although he distanced himself from post-structuralism and disavowed the word \"postmodernity\".\nDuring his career, Derrida published over 40 books, together with hundreds of essays and public presentations. He has had a significant influence on the humanities and social sciences, including philosophy, literature, law, anthropology, historiography, applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, music, architecture, and political theory.\nInto the 2000s, his work retained major academic influence throughout the United States, continental Europe, South America and all other countries where continental philosophy has been predominant, particularly in debates around ontology, epistemology (especially concerning social sciences), ethics, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and the philosophy of language. For the last two decades of his life, Derrida was Professor in Humanities at the University of California, Irvine. In most of the Anglosphere, where analytic philosophy is dominant, Derrida's influence is most presently felt in literary studies due to his longstanding interest in language and his association with prominent literary critics. He also influenced architecture (in the form of deconstructivism), music (especially in the musical atmosphere of hauntology), art, and art criticism.\nParticularly in his later writings, Derrida addressed ethical and political themes in his work. Some critics consider \"Speech and Phenomena\" (1967) to be his most important work, while others cite \"Of Grammatology\" (1967), \"Writing and Difference\" (1967), and \"Margins of Philosophy\" (1972). These writings influenced various activists and political movements. He became a well-known and influential public figure, while his approach to philosophy and the notorious abstruseness of his work made him controversial.\nEarly life and education.\nDerrida was born on 15 July 1930, in a summer home in El Biar (Algiers), Algeria, to Ha\u00efm Aaron Prosper Charles (known as \"Aim\u00e9\") Derrida (1896\u20131970), who worked all his life for the wine and spirits company Tachet, including as a travelling salesman (his son reflected the job was \"exhausting\" and \"humiliating\", his father forced him to be a \"docile employee\" to the extent of waking early to do the accounts at the dining-room table), and Georgette Sultana Esther (1901\u20131991), daughter of Mo\u00efse Safar. His family was Sephardic Jewish (originally from Toledo) and became French in 1870 when the Cr\u00e9mieux Decree granted full French citizenship to the Jews of Algeria. His parents named him \"Jackie\", \"which they considered to be an American name\", although he would later adopt a more \"correct\" version of his first name when he moved to Paris; some reports indicate that he was named Jackie after the American child actor Jackie Coogan, who had become well known around the world via his role in the 1921 Charlie Chaplin film \"The Kid\". He was also given the middle name \u00c9lie after his paternal uncle Eug\u00e8ne Eliahou, at his circumcision; this name was not recorded on his birth certificate unlike those of his siblings, and he would later call it his \"hidden name\".\nDerrida was the third of five children. His elder brother Paul Mo\u00efse died at less than three months old, the year before Derrida was born, leading him to suspect throughout his life his role as a replacement for his deceased brother. Derrida spent his youth in Algiers and in El-Biar.\nOn the first day of the school year in 1942, French administrators in Algeria\u2014implementing antisemitism quotas set by the Vichy government\u2014expelled Derrida from his lyc\u00e9e. He secretly skipped school for a year rather than attend the Jewish lyc\u00e9e formed by displaced teachers and students, and also took part in numerous football competitions (he dreamed of becoming a professional player). In this adolescent period, Derrida found in the works of philosophers and writers (such as Rousseau, Nietzsche, and Gide) an instrument of revolt against family and society. His reading also included Camus and Sartre.\nIn the late 1940s, he attended the Lyc\u00e9e Bugeaud, in Algiers; in 1949 he moved to Paris, attending the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, where his professor of philosophy was \u00c9tienne Borne. At that time he prepared for his entrance exam to the prestigious \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS); after failing the exam on his first try, he passed it on the second, and was admitted in 1952. On his first day at ENS, Derrida met Louis Althusser, with whom he became friends. A professor of his, Jan Czarnecki, was a progressive Protestant who would become a signer of the Manifesto of the 121. After visiting the Husserl Archive in Leuven, Belgium (1953\u20131954), he completed his master's degree in philosophy (\"dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures\") on Edmund Husserl. He then passed the highly competitive \"agr\u00e9gation\" exam in 1956. Derrida received a grant for studies at Harvard University, and he spent the 1956\u201357 academic year reading James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" at the Widener Library.\nCareer.\nDuring the Algerian War of Independence of 1954\u20131962, Derrida asked to teach soldiers' children in lieu of military service, teaching French and English from 1957 to 1959. Following the war, from 1960 to 1964, Derrida taught philosophy at the Sorbonne, where he was an assistant of Suzanne Bachelard (daughter of Gaston Bachelard), Georges Canguilhem, Paul Ric\u0153ur (who in these years coined the term \"hermeneutics of suspicion\"), and Jean Wahl. His wife, Marguerite, gave birth to their first child, Pierre, in 1963. In 1964, on the recommendation of Louis Althusser and Jean Hyppolite, Derrida got a permanent teaching position at the ENS, which he kept until 1984. In 1965 Derrida began an association with the \"Tel Quel\" group of literary and philosophical theorists, which lasted for seven years. Derrida's subsequent distance from the \"Tel Quel\" group, after 1971, was connected to his reservations about their embrace of Maoism and of the Chinese Cultural Revolution.\nWith \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences\", his contribution to a 1966 colloquium on structuralism at Johns Hopkins University, his work began to gain international prominence. At the same colloquium Derrida would meet Jacques Lacan and Paul de Man, the latter an important interlocutor in the years to come. A second son, Jean, was born in 1967. In the same year, Derrida published his first three books\u2014\"Writing and Difference\", \"Speech and Phenomena\", and \"Of Grammatology\".\nIn 1980, he received his first honorary doctorate (from Columbia University) and was awarded his State doctorate (\"doctorat d'\u00c9tat\") by submitting to the University of Paris ten of his previously published books in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project under the title \"L'inscription de la philosophie : Recherches sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'\u00e9criture\" (\"Inscription in Philosophy: Research on the Interpretation of Writing\"). The text of Derrida's defense was based on an abandoned draft doctoral thesis he had prepared in 1957 under the direction of Jean Hyppolite at the ENS entitled \"The Ideality of the Literary Object\" (\"L'id\u00e9alit\u00e9 de l'objet litt\u00e9raire\"); his 1980 dissertation was subsequently published in English translation as \"The Time of a Thesis: Punctuations\". In 1983 Derrida collaborated with Ken McMullen on the film \"Ghost Dance\". Derrida appears in the film as himself and also contributed to the script.\nDerrida traveled widely and held a series of visiting and permanent positions. Derrida became full professor (\"directeur d'\u00e9tudes\") at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris from 1984 (he had been elected at the end of 1983). With Fran\u00e7ois Ch\u00e2telet and others he in 1983 co-founded the Coll\u00e8ge international de philosophie (CIPH; 'International college of philosophy'), an institution intended to provide a location for philosophical research which could not be carried out elsewhere in the academia. He was elected as its first president. In 1985 Sylviane Agacinski gave birth to Derrida's third child, Daniel.\nOn 8 May 1985, Derrida was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, to Class IV \u2013 Humanities, Section 3 -Criticism and Philology.\nIn 1986 Derrida became Professor of the Humanities at the University of California, Irvine, where he taught until shortly before his death in 2004. His papers were filed in the university archives. When Derrida's colleague, Dragan Kujundzic, was accused of sexual assault, Derrida wrote a letter to then-Chancellor Cicerone saying \"if the scandalous procedure\" against Kujundzic was not \"interrupted or cancelled,\" he would end all his \"relations with UCI.\" Regarding his archival papers, there would be \"another consequence: since I never take back what I have given, my papers would of course remain the property of UCI and the Special Collections department of the library. However, it goes without saying that the spirit in which I contributed to the constitution of these archives (which is still underway and growing every year) would have been seriously damaged. Without renouncing my commitments, I would regret having made them and would reduce their fulfillment to the barest minimum.\" After Derrida's death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI's archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida's widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine's collection, although it dropped the suit in 2007.\nDerrida was a regular visiting professor at several other major American and European universities, including Johns Hopkins University, Yale University, New York University, Stony Brook University, The New School for Social Research, and European Graduate School.\nHe was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Cambridge (1992), Columbia University, The New School for Social Research, the University of Essex, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the University of Silesia, the University of Coimbra, the University of Athens, and many others around the world. In 2001, he received the from the University of Frankfurt.\nDerrida's honorary degree at Cambridge was protested by leading philosophers in the analytic tradition. Philosophers including Quine, Marcus, and Armstrong wrote a letter to the university objecting that \"Derrida's work does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour,\" and \"Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university\".\nLate in his life, Derrida participated in making two biographical documentaries, \"D'ailleurs, Derrida\" (\"Derrida's Elsewhere\") by Safaa Fathy (1999), and \"Derrida\" by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman (2002).\nOn 19 February 2003, with the 2003 invasion of Iraq impending, Ren\u00e9 Major moderated a debate entitled \"Pourquoi La Guerre Aujourd'hui?\" between Derrida and Jean Baudrillard, co-hosted by \"Major's Institute for Advanced Studies in Psychoanalysis\" and \"Le Monde Diplomatique\". The debate discussed the relation between terrorist attacks and the invasion.\nPersonal life and death.\nIn June 1957, he married the psychoanalyst Marguerite Aucouturier in Boston.\nDerrida was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2002. He died during surgery in a hospital in Paris in the early hours of 9 October 2004.\nAt the time of his death, Derrida had agreed to go for the summer to University of Heidelberg as holder of the Gadamer professorship, whose invitation was expressed by the hermeneutic philosopher himself before his death. Peter Hommelhoff, Rector at Heidelberg at that time, would summarize Derrida's place as: \"Beyond the boundaries of philosophy as an academic discipline he was a leading intellectual figure not only for the humanities but for the cultural perception of a whole age.\"\nPhilosophy.\nDerrida referred to himself as a historian. He questioned assumptions of the Western philosophical tradition and also more broadly Western culture. By questioning the dominant discourses, and trying to modify them, he attempted to democratize the university scene and to politicize it. Derrida called his challenge to the assumptions of Western culture \"deconstruction\". On some occasions, Derrida referred to deconstruction as a radicalization of a certain spirit of Marxism.\nWith his detailed readings of works from Plato to Rousseau to Heidegger, Derrida frequently argues that Western philosophy has uncritically allowed metaphorical depth models to govern its conception of language and consciousness. He sees these often unacknowledged assumptions as part of a \"metaphysics of presence\" to which philosophy has bound itself. This \"logocentrism\", Derrida argues, creates \"marked\" or hierarchized binary oppositions that have an effect on everything from the conception of speech's relation to writing to the understanding of racial difference. Deconstruction is an attempt to expose and undermine such \"metaphysics\".\nDerrida approaches texts as constructed around binary oppositions which all speech has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This approach to text is, in a broad sense, influenced by the semiology of Ferdinand de Saussure. Saussure, considered to be one of the fathers of structuralism, posited that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language.\nPerhaps Derrida's most quoted and famous assertion, which appears in an essay on Rousseau in his book \"Of Grammatology\" (1967), is the statement that \"there is no outside-text\" (). Critics of Derrida have been often accused of having mistranslated the phrase in French to suggest he had written \"\" (\"There is nothing outside the text\") and of having widely disseminated this translation to make it appear that Derrida is suggesting that nothing exists but words. Derrida once explained that this assertion \"which for some has become a sort of slogan, in general so badly understood, of deconstruction ... means nothing else: there is nothing outside context. In this form, which says exactly the same thing, the formula would doubtless have been less shocking.\"\nEarly works.\nDerrida began his career examining the limits of phenomenology. His first lengthy academic manuscript, written as a dissertation for his and submitted in 1954, concerned the work of Edmund Husserl. Gary Banham has said that the dissertation is \"in many respects the most ambitious of Derrida's interpretations with Husserl, not merely in terms of the number of works addressed but also in terms of the extraordinarily focused nature of its investigation.\" In 1962 he published \"Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction\", which contained his own translation of Husserl's essay. Many elements of Derrida's thought were already present in this work. In the interviews collected in \"Positions\" (1972), Derrida said: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In this essay the problematic of writing was already in place as such, bound to the irreducible structure of 'deferral' in its relationships to consciousness, presence, science, history and the history of science, the disappearance or delay of the origin, etc. ...this essay can be read as the other side (recto or verso, as you wish) of \"Speech and Phenomena\".\u2014\u200a\nDerrida first received major attention outside France with his lecture, \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences,\" delivered at Johns Hopkins University in 1966 (and subsequently included in \"Writing and Difference\"). The conference at which this paper was delivered was concerned with structuralism, then at the peak of its influence in France, but only beginning to gain attention in the United States. Derrida differed from other participants by his lack of explicit commitment to structuralism, having already been critical of the movement. He praised the accomplishments of structuralism but also maintained reservations about its internal limitations; this has led US academics to label his thought as a form of post-structuralism.\nThe effect of Derrida's paper was such that by the time the conference proceedings were published in 1970, the title of the collection had become \"The Structuralist Controversy\". The conference was also where he met Paul de Man, who would be a close friend and source of great controversy, as well as where he first met the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, with whose work Derrida had a mixed relationship.\nPhenomenology vs structuralism debate (1959).\nIn the early 1960s, Derrida began speaking and writing publicly, addressing the most topical debates at the time. One of these was the new and increasingly fashionable movement of structuralism, which was being widely favoured as the successor to the phenomenology approach, the latter having been started by Husserl sixty years earlier. Derrida's countercurrent take on the issue, at a prominent international conference, was so influential that it reframed the discussion from a celebration of the triumph of structuralism to a \"phenomenology vs structuralism debate\".\nPhenomenology, as envisioned by Husserl, is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since Plato in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's \"lived experience\"; for those with a more phenomenological bent, the goal was to understand experience by comprehending and describing its genesis, the process of its emergence from an origin or event. For the structuralists, this was a false problem, and the \"depth\" of experience could in fact only be an effect of structures which are not themselves experiential.\nIn that context, in 1959, Derrida asked the question: Must not structure have a genesis, and must not the origin, the point of genesis, be \"already\" structured, in order to be the genesis \"of\" something? In other words, every structural or \"synchronic\" phenomenon has a history, and the structure cannot be understood without understanding its genesis. At the same time, in order that there be movement or potential, the origin cannot be some pure unity or simplicity, but must already be articulated\u2014complex\u2014such that from it a \"diachronic\" process can emerge. This original complexity must not be understood as an original \"positing\", but more like a default of origin, which Derrida refers to as iterability, inscription, or textuality. It is this thought of originary complexity that sets Derrida's work in motion, and from which all of its terms are derived, including \"deconstruction\".\nDerrida's method consisted in demonstrating the forms and varieties of this originary complexity, and their multiple consequences in many fields. He achieved this by conducting thorough, careful, sensitive, and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts, to determine what aspects of those texts run counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis). By demonstrating the aporias and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways in which this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects.\n1967\u20131972.\nDerrida's interests crossed disciplinary boundaries, and his knowledge of a wide array of diverse material was reflected in the three collections of work published in 1967: \"Speech and Phenomena\", \"Of Grammatology\" (initially submitted as a thesis under Maurice de Gandillac), and \"Writing and Difference\".\nOn several occasions, Derrida has acknowledged his debt to Husserl and Heidegger, and stated that without them he would not have said a single word. Among the questions asked in these essays are \"What is 'meaning', what are its historical relationships to what is purportedly identified under the rubric 'voice' as a value of presence, presence of the object, presence of meaning to consciousness, self-presence in so called living speech and in self-consciousness?\" In another essay in \"Writing and Difference\" entitled \"Violence and Metaphysics: An Essay on the Thought of Emmanuel Levinas\", the roots of another major theme in Derrida's thought emerge: the Other as opposed to the Same \"Deconstructive analysis deprives the present of its prestige and exposes it to something \"tout autre\", \"wholly other\", beyond what is foreseeable from the present, beyond the horizon of the \"same\".\" Other than Rousseau, Husserl, Heidegger and Levinas, these three books discussed, and/or relied upon, the works of many philosophers and authors, including linguist Saussure, Hegel, Foucault, Bataille, Descartes, anthropologist L\u00e9vi-Strauss, paleontologist Leroi-Gourhan, psychoanalyst Freud, and writers such as Jab\u00e8s and Artaud.\nThis collection of three books published in 1967 elaborated Derrida's theoretical framework. Derrida attempts to approach the very heart of the Western intellectual tradition, characterizing this tradition as \"a search for a transcendental being that serves as the origin or guarantor of meaning\". The attempt to \"ground the meaning relations constitutive of the world in an instance that itself lies outside all relationality\" was referred to by Heidegger as logocentrism, and Derrida argues that the philosophical enterprise is \"essentially\" logocentric, and that this is a paradigm inherited from Judaism and Hellenism. He in turn describes logocentrism as phallocratic, patriarchal and masculinist. Derrida contributed to \"the understanding of certain deeply hidden philosophical presuppositions and prejudices in Western culture\", arguing that the whole philosophical tradition rests on arbitrary dichotomous categories (such as sacred/profane, signifier/signified, mind/body), and that any text contains implicit hierarchies, \"by which an order is imposed on reality and by which a subtle repression is exercised, as these hierarchies exclude, subordinate, and hide the various potential meanings.\" Derrida refers to his procedure for uncovering and unsettling these dichotomies as deconstruction of Western culture.\nIn 1968, he published his influential essay \"Plato's Pharmacy\" in the French journal \"Tel Quel\". This essay was later collected in \"Dissemination\", one of three books published by Derrida in 1972, along with the essay collection \"Margins of Philosophy\" and the collection of interviews entitled \"Positions\".\n1973\u20131980.\nStarting in 1972, Derrida produced on average more than one book per year. Derrida continued to produce important works, such as \"Glas\" (1974) and \"\" (1980).\nDerrida received increasing attention in the United States after 1972, where he was a regular visiting professor and lecturer at several major American universities. In the 1980s, during the American culture wars, conservatives started a dispute over Derrida's influence and legacy upon American intellectuals, and claimed that he influenced American literary critics and theorists more than academic philosophers.\n\"Of Spirit\" (1987).\nOn 14 March 1987, Derrida presented at the CIPH conference entitled \"Heidegger: Open Questions\", a lecture which was published in October 1987 as \"Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question\". It follows the shifting role of \"Geist\" (spirit) through Heidegger's work, noting that, in 1927, \"spirit\" was one of the philosophical terms that Heidegger set his sights on dismantling. With his Nazi political engagement in 1933, however, Heidegger came out as a champion of the \"German Spirit\", and only withdrew from an exalting interpretation of the term in 1953. Derrida asks, \"What of this meantime?\" His book connects in a number of respects with his long engagement of Heidegger (such as \"The Ends of Man\" in \"Margins of Philosophy\", his Paris seminar on philosophical nationality and nationalism in the mid-1980s, and the essays published in English as \"Geschlecht\" and \"Geschlecht II\"). He considers \"four guiding threads\" of Heideggerian philosophy that form \"the knot of this \"Geflecht\" [braid]\": \"the question of the question\", \"the essence of technology\", \"the discourse of animality\", and \"epochality\" or \"the hidden teleology or the narrative order.\"\n\"Of Spirit\" contributes to the long debate on Heidegger's Nazism and appeared at the same time as the French publication of a book by a previously unknown Chilean writer, Victor Far\u00edas, who charged that Heidegger's philosophy amounted to a wholehearted endorsement of the Nazi \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) faction. Derrida responded to Far\u00edas in an interview, \"Heidegger, the Philosopher's Hell\" and a subsequent article, \"Comment donner raison? How to Concede, with Reasons?\" He called Far\u00edas a weak reader of Heidegger's thought, adding that much of the evidence Far\u00edas and his supporters touted as new had long been known within the philosophical community.\n1990s: political and ethical themes.\nSome have argued that Derrida's work took a political and ethical \"turn\" in the 1990s. Texts cited as evidence of such a turn include \"Force of Law\" (1990), as well as \"Specters of Marx\" (1994) and \"Politics of Friendship\" (1994). Some refer to \"The Gift of Death\" as evidence that he began more directly applying deconstruction to the relationship between ethics and religion. In this work, Derrida interprets passages from the Bible, particularly on Abraham and the Sacrifice of Isaac, and from S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard's \"Fear and Trembling\".\nHowever, scholars such as Leonard Lawlor, Robert Magliola, and Nicole Anderson have argued that the \"turn\" has been exaggerated. Some, including Derrida himself, have argued that much of the philosophical work done in his \"political turn\" can be dated to earlier essays.\nDerrida develops an ethicist view respecting to hospitality, exploring the idea that two types of hospitalities exist, conditional and unconditional. Though this contributed to the works of many scholars, Derrida was seriously criticized for this.\nDerrida's contemporary readings of Emmanuel Levinas, Walter Benjamin, Carl Schmitt, Jan Pato\u010dka, on themes such as law, justice, responsibility, and friendship, had a significant impact on fields beyond philosophy. Derrida and Deconstruction influenced aesthetics, literary criticism, architecture, film theory, anthropology, sociology, historiography, law, psychoanalysis, theology, feminism, gay and lesbian studies and political theory. Jean-Luc Nancy, Richard Rorty, Geoffrey Hartman, Harold Bloom, Rosalind Krauss, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, Julia Kristeva, Duncan Kennedy, Gary Peller, Drucilla Cornell, Alan Hunt, Hayden White, Mario Kopi\u0107, and Alun Munslow are some of the authors who have been influenced by deconstruction.\nDerrida delivered a eulogy at Levinas' funeral, later published as \"Adieu \u00e0 Emmanuel L\u00e9vinas\", an appreciation and exploration of Levinas's moral philosophy. Derrida used Bracha L. Ettinger's interpretation of L\u00e9vinas' notion of femininity and transformed his own earlier reading of this subject respectively. \nDerrida continued to produce readings of literature, writing extensively on Maurice Blanchot, Paul Celan, and others.\nIn 1991 he published \"The Other Heading\", in which he discussed the concept of identity (as in cultural identity, European identity, and national identity), in the name of which in Europe have been unleashed \"the worst violences,\" \"the crimes of xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, religious or nationalist fanaticism.\"\nAt the 1997 Cerisy Conference, Derrida delivered a ten-hour address on the subject of \"the autobiographical animal\" entitled The Animal That Therefore I Am (More To Follow). Engaging with questions surrounding the ontology of nonhuman animals, the ethics of animal slaughter and the difference between humans and other animals, the address has been seen as initiating a late \"animal turn\" in Derrida's philosophy, although Derrida himself has said that his interest in animals is present in his earliest writings.\n\"The Work of Mourning\" (1981\u20132001).\nBeginning with \"The Deaths of Roland Barthes\" in 1981, Derrida produced a series of texts on mourning and memory occasioned by the loss of his friends and colleagues, many of them new engagements with their work. \"Memoires for Paul de Man\", a book-length lecture series presented first at Yale and then at Irvine as Derrida's Wellek Lecture, followed in 1986, with a revision in 1989 that included \"Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man's War\". Ultimately, fourteen essays were collected into \"The Work of Mourning\" (2001), which was expanded in the 2003 French edition, \"Chaque fois unique, la fin du monde\" (literally, \"Unique each time, the end of the world\"), to include essays dedicated to G\u00e9rard Granel and Maurice Blanchot.\n2002 film.\nIn October 2002, at the theatrical opening of the film \"Derrida\", he said that, in many ways, he felt more and more close to Guy Debord's work, and that this closeness appears in Derrida's texts. Derrida mentioned, in particular, \"everything I say about the media, technology, the spectacle, and the 'criticism of the show', so to speak, and the markets \u2013 the becoming-a-spectacle of everything, and the exploitation of the spectacle.\" Among the places in which Derrida mentions the \"Spectacle\", is a 1997 interview about the notion of the intellectual.\nPolitics.\nDerrida engaged with a variety of political issues, movements, and debates throughout his career. In 1968, he participated in the May 68 protests in France [and met frequently with Maurice Blanchot]?. However, he expressed concerns about the \"cult of spontaneity\" and anti-unionist euphoria that he observed. He also registered his objections to the Vietnam War in a lecture he gave in the United States. Derrida signed a petition against age of consent laws in 1977, and in 1981 he founded the French Jan Hus association to support dissident Czech intellectuals.\nIn 1981, Derrida was arrested by the Czechoslovakian government for leading a conference without authorization and charged with drug trafficking, although he claimed the drugs were planted on him. He was released with the help of the Mitterrand government and Michel Foucault. Derrida was an advocate for nuclear disarmament, protested against apartheid in South Africa, and met with Palestinian intellectuals during a visit to Jerusalem in 1988. He also opposed capital punishment and was involved in the campaign to free Mumia Abu-Jamal.\nAlthough Derrida was not associated with any political party until 1995, he supported the Socialist candidacy of Lionel Jospin, despite misgivings about such organizations. In the 2002 French presidential election, he refused to vote in the run-off election between far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen and center-right Jacques Chirac, citing a lack of acceptable choices. Derrida opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was engaged in rethinking politics and the political itself within and beyond philosophy. He focused on understanding the political implications of notions such as responsibility, reason of state, decision, sovereignty, and democracy. By 2000, he was theorizing \"democracy to come\" and thinking about the limitations of existing democracies.\nInfluences on Derrida.\nCrucial readings in his adolescence were Rousseau's \"Reveries of a Solitary Walker\" and \"Confessions\", Andr\u00e9 Gide's journal, \"La porte \u00e9troite\", \"Les nourritures terrestres\" and \"The Immoralist\"; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche. The phrase \"Families, I hate you!\" in particular, which inspired Derrida as an adolescent, is a famous verse from Gide's \"Les nourritures terrestres\", book IV. In a 1991 interview Derrida commented on a similar verse, also from book IV of the same Gide work: \"I hated the homes, the families, all the places where man thinks he'll find rest\" (\"Je ha\u00efssais les foyers, les familles, tous lieux o\u00f9 l'homme pense trouver un repos\").\nOther influences upon Derrida are Martin Heidegger, Plato, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve, Maurice Blanchot, Antonin Artaud, Roland Barthes, Georges Bataille, Edmund Husserl, Emmanuel L\u00e9vinas, Ferdinand de Saussure, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, J. L. Austin and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9.\nHis book, \"Adieu \u00e0 Emmanuel L\u00e9vinas\", reveals his mentorship by this philosopher and Talmudic scholar who practiced the phenomenological encounter with the Other in the form of the Face, which commanded human response. The use of deconstruction to read Jewish texts \u2013 like the Talmud \u2013 is relatively rare but has recently been attempted.\nPeers and contemporaries.\nDerrida's philosophical friends, allies, students and the heirs of Derrida's thought include Paul de Man, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Louis Althusser, Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Blanchot, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Sarah Kofman, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, Bernard Stiegler, Alexander Garc\u00eda D\u00fcttmann, Joseph Cohen, Geoffrey Bennington, Jean-Luc Marion, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Raphael Zagury-Orly, Jacques Ehrmann, Avital Ronell, Judith Butler, B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, Ernesto Laclau, Samuel Weber, Catherine Malabou, Michal Govrin and Claudette Sartiliot.\nNancy and Lacoue-Labarthe.\nJean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe were among Derrida's first students in France and went on to become well-known and important philosophers in their own right. Despite their considerable differences of subject, and often also of a method, they continued their close interaction with each other and with Derrida, from the early 1970s.\nDerrida wrote on both of them, including a long book on Nancy: \"Le Toucher, Jean-Luc Nancy\" (\"On Touching\u2014Jean-Luc Nancy\", 2005).\nPaul de Man.\nDerrida's most prominent friendship in intellectual life was with Paul de Man, which began with their meeting at Johns Hopkins University and continued until de Man's death in 1983. De Man provided a somewhat different approach to deconstruction, and his readings of literary and philosophical texts were crucial in the training of a generation of readers.\nShortly after de Man's death, Derrida wrote the book \"Memoires: pour Paul de Man\" and in 1988 wrote an article in the journal \"Critical Inquiry\" called \"Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man's War\". The memoir became cause for controversy, because shortly before Derrida published his piece, it had been discovered by the Belgian literary critic Ortwin de Graef that long before his academic career in the US, de Man had written almost two hundred essays in a pro-Nazi newspaper during the German occupation of Belgium, including several that were explicitly antisemitic.\nCritics of Derrida have argued that he minimizes the antisemitic character of de Man's writing. Some critics have found Derrida's treatment of this issue surprising, given that, for example, Derrida also spoke out against antisemitism and, in the 1960s, broke with the Heidegger disciple Jean Beaufret over Beaufret's instances of antisemitism, about which Derrida (and, after him, Maurice Blanchot) expressed shock.\nMichel Foucault.\nDerrida's criticism of Foucault appears in the essay \"Cogito and the History of Madness\" (from \"Writing and Difference\"). It was first given as a lecture on 4 March 1963, at a conference at Wahl's \"Coll\u00e8ge philosophique\", which Foucault attended, and caused a rift between the two men that was never fully mended.\nIn an appendix added to the 1972 edition of his \"History of Madness\", Foucault disputed Derrida's interpretation of his work, and accused Derrida of practicing \"a historically well-determined little pedagogy [...] which teaches the student that there is nothing outside the text [...]. A pedagogy which inversely gives to the voice of the masters that infinite sovereignty that allows it indefinitely to re-say the text.\" According to historian Carlo Ginzburg, Foucault may have written \"The Order of Things\" (1966) and \"The Archaeology of Knowledge\" partly under the stimulus of Derrida's criticism. Carlo Ginzburg briefly labeled Derrida's criticism in \"Cogito and the History of Madness\", as \"facile, nihilistic objections,\" without giving further argumentation.\nDerrida's translators.\nGeoffrey Bennington, Avital Ronell and Samuel Weber belong to a group of Derrida translators. Many of Derrida's translators are esteemed thinkers in their own right. Derrida often worked in a collaborative arrangement, allowing his prolific output to be translated into English in a timely fashion.\nHaving started as a student of de Man, Gayatri Spivak took on the translation of \"Of Grammatology\" early in her career and has since revised it into a second edition. Barbara Johnson's translation of Derrida's \"Dissemination\" was published by The Athlone Press in 1981. Alan Bass was responsible for several early translations; Bennington and Peggy Kamuf have continued to produce translations of his work for nearly twenty years. In recent years, a number of translations have appeared by Michael Naas (also a Derrida scholar) and Pascale-Anne Brault.\nBennington, Brault, Kamuf, Naas, Elizabeth Rottenberg, and David Wills are currently engaged in translating Derrida's previously unpublished seminars, which span from 1959 to 2003. Volumes I and II of \"The Beast and the Sovereign\" (presenting Derrida's seminars from 12 December 2001 to 27 March 2002 and from 11 December 2002 to 26 March 2003), as well as \"The Death Penalty, Volume I\" (covering 8 December 1999 to 22 March 2000), have appeared in English translation. Further volumes currently projected for the series include \"Heidegger: The Question of Being and History\" (1964\u20131965), \"Death Penalty, Volume II\" (2000\u20132001), \"Perjury and Pardon, Volume I\" (1997\u20131998), and \"Perjury and Pardon, Volume II\" (1998\u20131999).\nWith Bennington, Derrida undertook the challenge published as \"Jacques Derrida\", an arrangement in which Bennington attempted to provide a systematic explication of Derrida's work (called the \"Derridabase\") using the top two-thirds of every page, while Derrida was given the finished copy of every Bennington chapter and the bottom third of every page in which to show how deconstruction exceeded Bennington's account (this was called the \"Circumfession\"). Derrida seems to have viewed Bennington in particular as a kind of rabbinical explicator, noting at the end of the \"Applied Derrida\" conference, held at the University of Luton in 1995 that: \"everything has been said and, as usual, Geoff Bennington has said everything before I have even opened my mouth. I have the challenge of trying to be unpredictable after him, which is impossible... so I'll try to pretend to be unpredictable after Geoff. Once again.\"\nMarshall McLuhan.\nDerrida was familiar with the work of Marshall McLuhan, and since his early 1967 writings (\"Of Grammatology\", \"Speech and Phenomena\"), he speaks of language as a \"medium,\" of phonetic writing as \"the medium of the great metaphysical, scientific, technical, and economic adventure of the West.\"\nHe expressed his disagreement with McLuhan in regard to what he called McLuhan's ideology about the end of writing. In a 1982 interview, he said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think that there is an ideology in McLuhan's discourse that I don't agree with because he's an optimist as to the possibility of restoring an oral community which would get rid of the writing machines and so on. I think that's a very traditional myth which goes back to... let's say Plato, Rousseau... And instead of thinking that we are living at the end of writing, I think that in another sense we are living in the extension \u2013 the overwhelming extension \u2013 of writing. At least in the new sense... I don't mean the alphabetic writing down, but in the new sense of those writing machines that we're using now (e.g. the tape recorder). And this is writing too.\nAnd in his 1972 essay \"Signature Event Context\" he said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As writing, communication, if one insists upon maintaining the word, is not the means of transport of sense, the exchange of intentions and meanings, the discourse and \"communication of consciousnesses.\" We are not witnessing an end of writing which, to follow McLuhan's ideological representation, would restore a transparency or immediacy of social relations; but indeed a more and more powerful historical unfolding of a general writing of which the system of speech, consciousness, meaning, presence, truth, etc., would only be an effect, to be analyzed as such. It is this questioned effect that I have elsewhere called \"logocentrism\".\nArchitectural thinkers.\nDerrida had a direct impact on the theories and practices of influential architects Peter Eisenman and Bernard Tschumi towards the end of the twentieth century. Derrida impacted a project that was theorized by Eisenman in \"Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman\". This design was architecturally conceived by Tschumi for the Parc de la Villette in Paris, which included a sieve, or harp-like structure that Derrida envisaged as a physical metaphor for the receptacle-like properties of the \"kh\u00f4ra\". Moreover, Derrida's commentaries on Plato's notion of \"kh\u00f4ra\" (\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1) as set in the \"Timaeus\" (48e4) received later reflections in the philosophical works and architectural writings of the philosopher-architect Nader El-Bizri within the domain of phenomenology.\nDerrida used \"\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1\" to name a radical otherness that \"gives place\" for being. El-Bizri built on this by more narrowly taking \"kh\u00f4ra\" to name the radical happening of an ontological difference between being and beings. El-Bizri's reflections on \"kh\u00f4ra\" are taken as a basis for tackling the meditations on \"dwelling\" and on \"being and space\" in Heidegger's thought and the critical conceptions of space and place as they evolved in architectural theory (and its strands in phenomenological thinking), and in history of philosophy and science, with a focus on geometry and optics. This also describes El-Bizri's take on \"econtology\" as an extension of Heidegger's consideration of the question of being (\"Seinsfrage\") by way of the fourfold (\"Das Geviert\") of earth-sky-mortals-divinities (\"Erde und Himmel, Sterblichen und G\u00f6ttlichen\"); and as also impacted by his own meditations on Derrida's take on \"\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1\". Ecology is hence co-entangled with ontology, whereby the worldly existential analytics are grounded in earthiness, and environmentalism is orientated by ontological thinking\nDerrida argued that the subjectile is like Plato's \"kh\u00f4ra\", Greek for space, receptacle or site. Plato proposes that \"kh\u00f4ra\" rests between the sensible and the intelligible, through which everything passes but in which nothing is retained. For example, an image needs to be held by something, just as a mirror will hold a reflection. For Derrida, \"kh\u00f4ra\" defies attempts at naming or the either/or logic, which he \"deconstructed\".\nCriticism.\nCriticism from Marxists.\nIn a paper entitled \"Ghostwriting\", Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak\u2014the translator of Derrida's \"De la grammatologie\" (\"Of Grammatology\") into English\u2014criticised Derrida's understanding of Marx. Commenting on Derrida's \"Specters of Marx\", Terry Eagleton wrote \"The portentousness is ingrained in the very letter of this book, as one theatrically inflected rhetorical question tumbles hard on the heels of another in a tiresomely mannered syntax which lays itself wide open to parody.\"\nCriticism from Anglophone philosophers.\nThough Derrida addressed the American Philosophical Association on at least one occasion in 1988, and was highly regarded by some contemporary philosophers like Richard Rorty, Alexander Nehamas, and Stanley Cavell, his work has been regarded by other analytic philosophers, such as John Searle and Willard Van Orman Quine, as pseudophilosophy or sophistry.\nSome analytic philosophers have in fact claimed, since at least the 1980s, that Derrida's work is \"not philosophy\". One of the main arguments they gave was alleging that Derrida's influence had not been on US philosophy departments but on literature and other humanities disciplines.\nIn his 1989 \"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity\", Richard Rorty argues that Derrida (especially in his book, \"\", one section of which is an experiment in fiction) purposefully uses words that cannot be defined (e.g., \"diff\u00e9rance\"), and uses previously definable words in contexts diverse enough to make understanding impossible, so that the reader will never be able to contextualize Derrida's literary self. Rorty, however, argues that this intentional obfuscation is philosophically grounded. In garbling his message Derrida is attempting to escape the na\u00efve, positive metaphysical projects of his predecessors.\nRoger Scruton wrote in 2004, \"He's difficult to summarise because it's nonsense. He argues that the meaning of a sign is never revealed in the sign but deferred indefinitely and that a sign only means something by virtue of its difference from something else. For Derrida, there is no such thing as meaning \u2013 it always eludes us and therefore anything goes.\"\nOn Derrida's scholarship and writing style, Noam Chomsky wrote \"I found the scholarship appalling, based on pathetic misreading; and the argument, such as it was, failed to come close to the kinds of standards I've been familiar with since virtually childhood. Well, maybe I missed something: could be, but suspicions remain, as noted.\"\nPaul R. Gross and Norman Levitt also criticized his work for misusing scientific terms and concepts in \"\" (1994).\nThree quarrels (or disputes) in particular went out of academic circles and received international mass media coverage: the 1972\u201388 quarrel with John Searle, the analytic philosophers' pressures on Cambridge University not to award Derrida an honorary degree, and a dispute with Richard Wolin and the NYRB.\nCambridge honorary doctorate.\nIn 1992 some academics at Cambridge University, mostly not from the philosophy faculty, proposed that Derrida be awarded an honorary doctorate. This was opposed by, among others, the university's Professor of Philosophy Hugh Mellor. Eighteen other philosophers from US, Austrian, Australian, French, Polish, Italian, German, Dutch, Swiss, Spanish, and British institutions, including Barry Smith, Willard Van Orman Quine, David Armstrong, Ruth Barcan Marcus, and Ren\u00e9 Thom, then sent a letter to Cambridge claiming that Derrida's work \"does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour\" and describing Derrida's philosophy as being composed of \"tricks and gimmicks similar to those of the Dadaists\". The letter concluded that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the end the protesters were outnumbered\u2014336 votes to 204\u2014when Cambridge put the motion to a formal ballot; though almost all of those who proposed Derrida and who voted in favour were not from the philosophy faculty. Hugh Mellor continued to find the award undeserved, explaining: \"He is a mediocre, unoriginal philosopher \u2014 he is not even interestingly bad\".\nDerrida suggested in an interview that part of the reason for the attacks on his work was that it questioned and modified \"the rules of the dominant discourse, it tries to politicize and democratize education and the university scene\". To answer a question about the \"exceptional violence\", the compulsive \"ferocity\", and the \"exaggeration\" of the \"attacks\", he would say that these critics organize and practice in his case \"a sort of obsessive personality cult that philosophers should know how to question and above all to moderate\".\nDispute with Richard Wolin and the \"NYRB\".\nRichard Wolin has argued since 1991 that Derrida's work, as well as that of Derrida's major inspirations (e.g., Bataille, Blanchot, Levinas, Heidegger, Nietzsche), leads to a corrosive nihilism. For example, Wolin argues that the \"deconstructive gesture of overturning and reinscription ends up by threatening to efface many of the essential differences between Nazism and non-Nazism\".\nIn 1991, when Wolin published a Derrida interview on Heidegger in the first edition of \"The Heidegger Controversy\", Derrida argued that the interview was an intentionally malicious mistranslation, which was \"demonstrably execrable\" and \"weak, simplistic, and compulsively aggressive\". As French law requires the consent of an author to translations and this consent was not given, Derrida insisted that the interview not appear in any subsequent editions or reprints. Columbia University Press subsequently refused to offer reprints or new editions. Later editions of \"The Heidegger Controversy\" by MIT Press also omitted the Derrida interview. The matter achieved public exposure owing to a friendly review of Wolin's book by the Heideggerian scholar Thomas Sheehan that appeared in \"The New York Review of Books\", in which Sheehan characterised Derrida's protests as an imposition of censorship. It was followed by an exchange of letters. Derrida in turn responded to Sheehan and Wolin, in \"The Work of Intellectuals and the Press (The Bad Example: How the New York Review of Books and Company do Business)\", which was published in the book \"Points...\".\nTwenty-four academics, belonging to different schools and groups \u2013 often in disagreement with each other and with deconstruction \u2013 signed a letter addressed to \"The New York Review of Books\", in which they expressed their indignation for the magazine's behaviour as well as that of Sheenan and Wolin.\nCritical obituaries.\nCritical obituaries of Derrida were published in \"The New York Times\", \"The Economist\", and \"The Independent\". The magazine \"The Nation\" responded to the \"New York Times\" obituary saying that \"even though American papers had scorned and trivialized Derrida before, the tone seemed particularly caustic\". A second obituary by deconstruction scholar and Derrida's friend Mark C. Taylor was published by the \"Times\" a few days after the first one.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She scored fifteen top-ten singles, including five number-one singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and two number-one albums on the \"Billboard\" 200: \"If You Love Me, Let Me Know\" (1974) and \"Have You Never Been Mellow\" (1975). Eleven of her singles (including two Platinum) and fourteen of her albums (including two Platinum and four 2\u00d7 Platinum) have been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). She was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia in 2006 and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2020.\nNewton-John, who had breast cancer three times, was an advocate and sponsor for breast cancer research. In 2012, the Olivia Newton-John Cancer &amp; Wellness Centre at the Austin Hospital opened in her home town of Melbourne; in 2015, the facility was rechristened the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness &amp; Research Centre. She was also an activist for environmental and animal rights causes.\nEarly life and family.\nOlivia Newton-John was born on 26 September 1948 in Cambridge to Brinley \"Brin\" Newton-John (1914\u20131992) and Irene Helene (n\u00e9e Born; 1914\u20132003). Her father was born and raised in Wales to a middle-class family. Her mother was born and raised in Germany to a German-Jewish academic family who came to the UK in 1933 to escape the Nazi regime.\nNewton-John's maternal grandfather was German Jewish Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Max Born. Her maternal grandmother Hedwig was the daughter of German Jewish jurist Victor Ehrenberg and his Lutheran wife, Helene Agatha von Jhering. Through Helene Agatha, Newton-John was a descendant of Protestant theologian Martin Luther. She was also descended from an unspecified Spanish monarch. Helene Agatha's own father, Newton-John's great-great-grandfather, was jurist Rudolf von Jhering. Newton-John's uncle was pharmacologist Gustav Victor Rudolf Born. Through her Ehrenberg line, Newton-John was a third cousin of comedian Ben Elton.\nNewton-John's father was an MI5 officer on the Enigma project at Bletchley Park who took Rudolf Hess into custody during World War II. After the war, he became the headmaster of the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys and was in this post when Newton-John was born.\nIn early 1954, when Newton-John was five, her family emigrated to Melbourne, Victoria, on the SS \"Strathaird\". Her father worked as a professor of German and as the master of Ormond College at the University of Melbourne. Her family attended church while her father served as the head of the Presbyterian college.\nNewton-John attended Christ Church Grammar School in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra and then the University High School in Parkville.\nNewton-John was the youngest of three children. The eldest sibling was Hugh Newton-John, who became a physician and infectious diseases specialist.\nNewton-John's older sister, Rona Newton-John, became a model and actress whose acting career in the UK included appearances on \"The Benny Hill Show\" and Gerry Anderson's \"UFO\". Rona was married three times and had four children. Offspring from her first marriage (1961\u20131968) to restaurateur and nightclub owner Brian Goldsmith include music producer Brett Goldsmith and entertainer Tottie Goldsmith, a founder member of the band The Chantoozies. Racing car driver Emerson Newton-John is the son from her second marriage to Graham Hall, and Rona was also married from 1980 to 1985 to \"Grease\" and \"Taxi\" actor Jeff Conaway.\nNewton-John's parents divorced in 1958. Her father Brin remarried two more times and also had two more children with his second wife.\nCareer.\nCareer beginnings.\nNewton-John went to primary school with Daryl Braithwaite, who also followed a singing career. At age 14, with three classmates, Newton-John formed a short-lived, all-girl group called Sol Four which often performed at a coffee shop owned by her brother-in-law.\nNewton-John originally wanted to become a vet but then chose to focus on performance after doubting her ability to pass science exams.\nIn 1964, Newton-John's acting talent was first recognised portraying Lady Mary Lasenby in her University High School's production of \"The Admirable Crichton\" as she became the Young Sun's Drama Award best schoolgirl actress runner-up. She then became a regular on local Australian television shows, including \"Time for Terry\" and HSV-7's \"The Happy Show\", where she performed as \"Lovely Livvy\". She also appeared on \"The Go!! Show,\" where she met her future duet partner, singer Pat Carroll, and her future music producer, John Farrar. (Carroll and Farrar later married.)\nIn 1965, she entered and won a talent contest on the television program \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" hosted by 1960s Australian icon Johnny O'Keefe. She performed the songs \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" and \"Everything's Coming Up Roses\". She was initially reluctant to use her prize, a trip to Great Britain, but travelled there nearly a year later after her mother encouraged her to broaden her horizons.\nWhile in Britain, Newton-John missed her then-boyfriend, Ian Turpie, with whom she had co-starred in the 1965 Australian telefilm \"Funny Things Happen Down Under\". She repeatedly booked trips back to Australia that her mother cancelled.\nIn 1966, Newton-John recorded her first single, \"Till You Say You'll Be Mine\", in Britain for Decca Records.\nNewton-John's outlook changed when Pat Carroll moved to the UK. The two formed a duo called Pat and Olivia and toured nightclubs in Europe. (In one incident, they were booked at Paul Raymond's Revue in Soho, London, and were unaware that it was a strip club until they began to perform onstage dressed primly in frilly high-collared dresses.) During this period, she and Carroll contributed backup vocals to recordings by a number of other artists, notably the song \"Come In, You'll Get Pneumonia\" by the Easybeats. After Carroll's visa expired, Carroll was forced to return to Australia but Newton-John remained in Britain to pursue solo work.\nNewton-John was recruited for the group Toomorrow, formed by American producer Don Kirshner. In 1970, the group starred in the science fiction musical \"Toomorrow\" and recorded an accompanying soundtrack album on RCA Records; both the LP and the movie were named after the group. That same year, the group made two single recordings: \"You're My Baby Now\"/\"Goin' Back\" and \"I Could Never Live Without Your Love\"/\"Roll Like a River\". Neither track became a chart success; the project failed and the group disbanded.\n1971\u20131974: Early success.\nIn 1971, Newton-John released her first solo album, \"If Not for You\" (US No. 158 Pop). In the UK, the album was released as \"Olivia Newton-John\". The title track, written by Bob Dylan, was her first international hit (US No. 25 Pop, No. 1 Adult Contemporary/\"AC\"). Her follow-up single, \"Banks of the Ohio\", was a top 10 hit in the UK and Australia, but only peaked at number 94 in the United States. She was voted Best British Female Vocalist two years in a row by the magazine \"Record Mirror\". She made frequent appearances on Cliff Richard's weekly show \"It's Cliff Richard\" and starred with him in the telefilm \"The Case\".\nNewton-John's 1972 single \"What Is Life\" (No. 34 AC) made minimal impact in the United States. As a result, her second studio album \"Olivia\" was never formally issued in the United States. The subsequent single, \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\", similarly saw little success. Her fortune changed with the release of \"Let Me Be There\" in 1973. The song reached the American top 10 on the Pop (No. 6), Country (No. 7), and AC (No. 3) charts and earned her a Grammy for Best Country Female and an Academy of Country Music award for Most Promising Female Vocalist.\nHer third studio album \"Let Me Be There\" was released in November 1973, retitled \"Music Makes My Day\" in Britain. The US and Canadian versions featured an alternate track list that mixed new cuts with selections from \"Olivia\" and also recycled six songs from \"If Not for You\", which was going out of print.\nIn 1974, Newton-John represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Long Live Love\". The song was chosen for Newton-John by the British public out of six possible entries (Newton-John later admitted that she disliked the song). Newton-John finished fourth at the contest, held in Brighton, behind the Swedish winning entry, \"Waterloo\" by ABBA. All six Eurovision contest song candidates\u2014\"Have Love, Will Travel\", \"Lovin' You Ain't Easy\", \"Long Live Love\", \"Someday\", \"Angel Eyes\" and \"Hands Across the Sea\"\u2014were recorded by Newton-John and included on her \"Long Live Love\" album, her first for the EMI Records label.\nThe \"Long Live Love\" album was released in the US and Canada as \"If You Love Me, Let Me Know\". All the Eurovision entries were dropped for different and more country-flavoured tunes intended to capitalise on the success of \"Let Me Be There\"; the North American offering used selections from \"Long Live Love\", \"Olivia\" and \"Music Makes My Day\", and only the title cut was new. The album reached No. 1 on both the pop (one week) and country (eight weeks) albums charts. \"If You Love Me, Let Me Know\"'s title track was its first single and reached No. 5 Pop, No. 2 Country (her highest-peaking song on the chart) and No. 2 AC. The next single, \"I Honestly Love You\", became Newton-John's signature song. Written and composed by Jeff Barry and Peter Allen, the ballad became her first Pop number-one (staying there for two weeks), second AC number-one (for three weeks) and third top-10 Country (No. 6) hit and earned Newton-John two more Grammys for Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance \u2013 Female. In her 2018 autobiography, \"Don't Stop Believin',\" Newton-John describes \"I Honestly Love You\" as a song which is \"so simple, with a meaning that was deeper than the ocean\". In 1974, she received the (BCMA) British Country Music Association Award for \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" in London, England.\nIn the United States, Newton-John's success in country music sparked a debate among purists, who took issue with a foreigner singing country-flavoured pop music being classed with native Nashville artists. In addition to her Grammy for \"Let Me Be There\", in 1974 Newton-John was also named the Country Music Association Female Vocalist of the Year, a designation which made her the first British singer to have won the award; and the title also meant she defeated more established Nashville-based nominees Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tanya Tucker, as well as Canadian artist Anne Murray.\nThis protest by country music participants led to the formation of the short-lived Association of Country Entertainers (ACE). Newton-John was eventually supported by the country music community. Stella Parton, Dolly's sister, recorded \"Ode to Olivia\" and Newton-John recorded her 1976 album, \"Don't Stop Believin'\", in Nashville, Tennessee.\n1975\u20131977: \"Have You Never Been Mellow\", \"Clearly Love\", and continued success.\nEncouraged by expatriate Australian singer Helen Reddy, Newton-John left the UK and moved to the US. Newton-John topped the Pop (one week) and Country (six weeks) albums charts with her next album, \"Have You Never Been Mellow\". For 45 years, Olivia held the Guinness World Record for the shortest gap (154 days) by a female between new Number 1 albums (\"If You Love Me, Let Me Know &gt; Have You Never Been Mellow\") on the US Billboard 200 album charts until Taylor Swift in 2020 (140 days with \"folklore &gt; evermore\").\nThe \"Have You Never Been Mellow\" album generated two singles \u2013 the John Farrar-penned title track (No. 1 Pop, No. 3 Country, No. 1 AC) and \"Please Mr. Please\" (No. 3 Pop, No. 5 Country, No. 1 AC).\nHer pop career cooled with the release of her next album, \"Clearly Love\". Her streak of five consecutive gold top 10 singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 ended when the album's first single, \"Something Better to Do\", stopped at No. 13 (also No. 19 Country and No. 1 AC). Her albums still achieved gold status, and she returned to the top ten of the Hot 100 and \"Billboard\" 200 charts again in 1978.\nNewton-John's singles continued to top the AC chart, where she amassed ten No. 1 singles, including a record seven consecutively:\nShe provided a prominent, but uncredited, vocal on John Denver's \"Fly Away\" single, which was succeeded by her own single, \"Let It Shine\"/\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\", at No. 1 on the AC chart. (\"Fly Away\" returned to No. 1 after the two-week reign of \"Let It Shine\".) In December 1975, she appeared on the ABC special \"John Denver - A Rocky Mountain Christmas\", where she performed the duet of \"Fly Away\" with John, as well as \"Let It Shine\". Newton-John also continued to reach the Country top 10 where she tallied seven top-10 singles through 1976's \"Come on Over\" (No. 23 Pop, No. 5 Country, No. 1 AC) (from the same-titled album) and six consecutive (of a career nine total) top-10 albums through 1976's \"Don't Stop Believin'\" (No. 30 Pop, No. 7 Country). She headlined her first US television special, \"A Special Olivia Newton-John\", in November 1976.\nIn 1977, the single \"Sam\", a mid-tempo waltz from \"Don't Stop Believin'\", returned her to the No. 1 spot on the AC (No. 40 Country) and also reached No. 20 Pop, her highest chart placement since \"Something Better to Do\". By mid-1977, Newton-John's pop, AC, and country success all suffered a slight blow. Her \"Making a Good Thing Better\" album (No. 34 Pop, No. 13 Country) was not certified gold, and its only single, the title track (No. 87 Pop, No. 20 AC), did not reach the AC top 10 or the Country chart. Later that year, \"Olivia Newton-John's Greatest Hits\" (No. 13 Pop, No. 7 Country) became her first platinum album.\nNewton-John was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1979 New Year Honours and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to charity, cancer research, and entertainment.\n1978\u20131979: \"Grease\" and \"Totally Hot\".\nIn 1978, Newton-John's career soared after she starred as Sandy in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical \"Grease.\" She was offered the role after meeting producer Allan Carr at a dinner party at Helen Reddy's home. Disillusioned by her \"Toomorrow\" experience and concerned that she was too old to play a high school senior (she was 28 during the filming of \"Grease\"), Newton-John insisted on a screen test with the film's co-lead, John Travolta. Newton-John previewed some of the film's soundtrack during her second American network television special, \"Olivia\", featuring guests ABBA and Andy Gibb.\n\"Grease\" became the biggest box-office hit of 1978. Newton-John's performance, however, received mixed reviews. spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 and yielded three Top 5 singles for Newton-John: the platinum \"You're the One That I Want\" (No. 1 Pop, No. 23 AC) with John Travolta, the gold \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" (No. 3 Pop, No. 20 Country, No. 7 AC) and the gold \"Summer Nights\" (No. 5 Pop, No. 21 AC) with John Travolta and the film's cast. Newton-John became the second woman (after Linda Ronstadt in 1977) to have two singles\u2014\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" and \"Summer Nights\"\u2014in the \"Billboard\" top 5 simultaneously. The soundtrack is one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time. In June 2006, Newton-John's company ON-J Productions Ltd filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) for $1\u00a0million in unpaid royalties from the \"Grease\" soundtrack. In 2007, it was announced that she and UMG had reached a \"conditional settlement\".\nNewton-John's performance earned her a People's Choice Award for Favourite Film Actress. She was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Musical and performed the Oscar-nominated \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" at the 1979 Academy Awards. The film's popularity has endured. It was re-released for its 20th anniversary in 1998 and ranked as the second highest-grossing film behind \"Titanic\" in its opening weekend. Following her death in August 2022, AMC announced that the picture would reappear in some of its cinemas over the weekend and that a portion of the proceeds would go to breast cancer research.\nIn November 1978, she released her next studio album, \"Totally Hot\", which became her first solo top-10 (No. 7) album since \"Have You Never Been Mellow\". Dressed on the cover all in leather, Newton-John capitalised on her character's look that was introduced at the end of \"Grease;\" moreover, \"Totally Hot\"'s singles\u2014\"A Little More Love\" (No. 3 Pop, No. 94 Country, No. 4 AC), \"Deeper Than the Night\" (No. 11 Pop, No. 87 Country, No. 4 AC), and the title track (No. 52 Pop)\u2014all demonstrated a more aggressive and uptempo sound for Newton-John. Although the album de-emphasised the country sound, the LP still reached No. 4 on the Country Albums chart. Newton-John released the B-side, \"Dancin' 'Round and 'Round\", of the \"Totally Hot\" single to Country radio. The entry peaked at No. 29 (as well as No. 82 Pop and No. 25 AC), and it became her last charted solo Country airplay single.\nNewton-John cancelled a 1978 concert tour of Japan in protest at the slaughter of dolphins caught in tuna fishing nets. She subsequently rescheduled the tour when the Japanese government assured her that the practice was being curbed. In honor of dolphins, in 1981 she also composed and recorded the song \"The Promise (the Dolphin Song)\" on the \"Physical\" album.\nShe was a performer on the 1979 \"Music for UNICEF Concert\" for the UN's International Year of the Child televised worldwide. During the concert, artists performed songs for which they donated their royalties, some in perpetuity, to benefit the cause.\nLawsuit against MCA Records.\nIn April 1975, Newton-John and MCA entered into an initial two-year, four-album deal in which she was expected to deliver two LPs a year for the record company. MCA also had the option of extending the contract for six more records and three more years; and if the artist did not deliver on time, MCA was allegedly allowed to lengthen the term of the contract.\nPer her new agreement with MCA, Newton-John's first three albums, beginning with \"Clearly Love\", came out on schedule. Her fourth, \"Making a Good Thing Better\", was late. This delay occurred around the same time she was working on \"Grease\" for RSO Records, and the postponement arguably gave MCA\u2014which seemed to want to keep its hold on the performer\u2014the right to exercise its option, extend its contract, and stop her from signing with another enterprise. She also did not deliver a \"newly optioned\" album.\nOn 31 May 1978, Newton-John and MCA each filed breach-of-contract actions against the other. Newton-John sued for $10 million and claimed that MCA's failure to adequately promote and advertise her product freed her from their agreement. MCA's countersuit requested $1 million in damages and an injunction against Newton-John working with another music firm.\nUltimately, Newton-John was forbidden from offering her recording services to another label until the five-year pact had run its course. The original covenant was not automatically extended, though she had not duly supplied the total sum of vinyls indicated in the contract.\nAs a result of the lawsuit, record companies changed their contracts to be based on the number of albums recorded by a musician and not a specific number of years.\n1980\u20131988: \"Physical\", \"Soul Kiss\", and \"The Rumour\".\nNewton-John began 1980 by releasing \"I Can't Help It\" (No. 12 Pop, No. 8 AC), a duet with Andy Gibb from his \"After Dark\" album, and by starring in her third television special, \"Hollywood Nights\". Later that year, she appeared in her first film since \"Grease\" when she starred with Gene Kelly and Michael Beck in the musical fantasy \"Xanadu\". Although the film was a critical failure, its soundtrack (No. 4 Pop) was certified double platinum and scored five top 20 singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Newton-John charted with \"Magic\" (No. 1 Pop, No. 1 AC), \"Suddenly\" with Cliff Richard (No. 20 Pop, No. 4 AC) and the title song \"Xanadu\" with the Electric Light Orchestra (No. 8 Pop, No. 2 AC). [ELO also charted with \"I'm Alive\" (No. 16 Pop, No. 48 AC) and \"All Over the World\" (No. 13 Pop, No. 46 AC).]\n\"Magic\" was Newton-John's biggest pop hit to that point (four weeks at No. 1) and still ranks as the biggest AC hit of her career (five weeks at No. 1). The film \"Xanadu\" has since become a cult classic and the basis for a Broadway show that ran for more than 500 performances beginning in 2007 and was nominated for four Tony Awards, including Best Musical.\nIn 1981, Newton-John released her most successful studio album, the double platinum \"Physical\", which strongly reinforced her image change by showcasing risqu\u00e9, rock-oriented material. Newton-John explained: \"I just wasn't in the mood for tender ballads. I wanted peppy stuff because that's how I'm feeling.\" Of the title cut, Newton-John said: \"Roger Davies was my manager at the time; he played it for me and I knew it was a very catchy song.\" The title track, written by Steve Kipner and Terry Shaddick, spent ten weeks atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. This matched the record at that time held by Debby Boone's \"You Light Up My Life\" for most weeks spent at No. 1 on the Hot 100. The single was certified platinum, and it ultimately ranked as the biggest song of the decade. (In 2008, \"Billboard\" ranked the song No. 6 among all songs that charted in the 50-year history of the Hot 100.)\n\"Physical\" earned Newton-John her only placement ever on the R&amp;B Singles (No. 28) and Albums (No. 32) charts. The \"Physical\" album spawned two more singles, \"Make a Move on Me\" (No. 5 Pop, No. 6 AC) and \"Landslide\" (No. 52 Pop).\nThe provocative lyrics of the \"Physical\" title track prompted two Utah radio stations to ban the single from their playlists. (In 2010, \"Billboard\" magazine ranked this as the most popular single ever about sex.) To counter its overtly suggestive tone, Newton-John filmed an exercise-themed video that turned the song into an aerobics anthem and made headbands a fashion accessory outside the gym.\nShe helped pioneer the music video industry by recording a video album for \"Physical\", featuring videos of all the album's tracks and three of her older hits. The video album earned her a fourth Grammy and was aired as an ABC prime-time special, \"Let's Get Physical\", becoming a top-10 Nielsen hit. Newton-John asserted: \"Like everyone, I've got different sides of my personality. I've my dominant self, my need-to-be-dominated self, the sane Olivia and the crazy Olivia. Playing these different characters gave me a chance to show strange parts people haven't seen much.\"\nThe success of \"Physical\" led to an international tour and the release of her second hits collection, the double-platinum \"Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2\" (No. 16 Pop), which yielded two more top-40 singles: \"Heart Attack\" (No. 3 Pop) and \"Tied Up\" (No. 38 Pop). The tour was filmed for her \"Olivia in Concert\" television special, which premiered on HBO in January 1983. The special was subsequently released to video, earning Newton-John another Grammy nomination.\nNewton-John reteamed with Travolta in 1983 for the critically and commercially unsuccessful movie \"Two of a Kind\", redeemed by its platinum soundtrack (No. 26 Pop) featuring \"Twist of Fate\" (No. 5 Pop), \"Livin' in Desperate Times\" (No. 31 Pop), and a new duet with Travolta, \"Take a Chance\" (No. 3 AC). Newton-John released another video package, the Grammy-nominated \"Twist of Fate\", featuring videos of her four songs on the \"Two of a Kind\" soundtrack and the two new singles from \"Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2\".\nThat same year Newton-John and Pat Farrar (formerly Pat Carroll) founded Koala Blue. The store, originally for Australian imports, evolved into a chain of women's clothing boutiques. The chain was initially successful, but it eventually declared bankruptcy and closed in 1992. Newton-John and Farrar were the targets of a multimillion-dollar lawsuit when Koala Blue franchise holders alleged breach of contract and unfair competition; agreeing with a motion citing insufficient evidence, a judge dismissed the case on summary judgment in 1993. Newton-John and Farrar later licensed the brand name for a line of Australian wines.\nNewton-John, a supporter of Australian rules football Carlton, performed the Australian national anthem at the 1986 VFL Grand Final between Carlton and Hawthorn.\nNewton-John's music career cooled again with the release of her next studio album, the gold \"Soul Kiss\" (No. 29 Pop), in 1985. The album's only charted single was the title track (No. 20 Pop, No. 20 AC). The video album for \"Soul Kiss\" featured only five of the album's ten tracks (concept videos for the album's singles \"Soul Kiss\" and \"Toughen Up\" as well as performance videos of the tracks \"Culture Shock\", \"Emotional Tangle\" and \"The Right Moment\").\nAfter a nearly three-year hiatus following the birth of her daughter Chloe in January 1986, Newton-John resumed her recording career with the 1988 album \"The Rumour\". The album was promoted by an HBO special, \"Olivia Down Under\". Its first single, the title track, was written and produced by Elton John. Both the single (No. 62 Pop, No. 33 AC) and the album (No. 67 Pop) faltered commercially as the nearly 40-year-old Newton-John seemed \"old\" when compared with the teen queens Debbie Gibson and Tiffany ruling the pop charts at that time. (The album was praised by critics as more mature, with Newton-John addressing topics such as AIDS (\"Love and Let Live\"), the environment and single-parent households.)\nThe second single, \"Can't We Talk It Over in Bed\", did not chart, but was released in 1989 by Grayson Hugh, the song's arranger, and became a top-20 pop hit as \"Talk It Over\".\n1989\u20131998: Motherhood, cancer, and advocacy.\nIn September 1989, Newton-John released her self-described \"self-indulgent\" album, \"Warm and Tender\", which reunited her with producer John Farrar, absent from her previous LP, and also marked a return to a more wholesome image. Inspired by her daughter, who appeared on the cover, the album featured lullabies and love songs for parents and their children. This album, the last one produced by Farrar, also failed to revive her recording career, as the disc reached only No. 124 Pop.\nShe was appointed a Goodwill ambassador to the United Nations Environment Programme.\nNewton-John's television work included starring in two Christmas films, \"A Mom for Christmas\" (1990) and \"A Christmas Romance\" (1994) \u2013 both top 10 Nielsen hits.\nNewton-John was primed for another comeback in 1992 when she compiled her third hits collection, \"\", and planned her first tour since her \"Physical\" trek ten years earlier. Shortly after the album's release, Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer, forcing her to cancel all publicity for the album, including the tour. She received her diagnosis the same weekend her father died.\nNewton-John recovered. In 1991, she became the National Spokesperson for the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund/CHEC (Children's Health Environmental Coalition) following the death from Wilms' tumour of five-year-old Colette Chuda, daughter of Newton-John's friend Nancy Chuda. Later, Newton-John became an advocate for breast cancer research and other health issues. She was a product spokesperson for the Liv-Kit, a breast self-examination product, and also founded her own cancer centre in her home town in Australia.\nNewton-John's cancer diagnosis also affected the type of music she recorded. In 1994, she released \"\", which chronicled her ordeal. Co-produced by Newton-John for ONJ Productions, \"Gaia\" was originally issued by Festival in Australia but also distributed by various independent labels in Japan and Europe. In 2002, there was an American distribution by Hip-O Records, and a subsequent re-release in 2012 by Green Hill featured an alternative cover photo. \"Gaia\" was the first album on which Newton-John wrote all the music and lyrics herself, and this endeavour encouraged her to become more active as a songwriter thereafter. The single \"No Matter What You Do\" entered the Australian top 40, and the second single, the environmentally themed \"Don't Cut Me Down\", was also used in the film \"It's My Party\", a 1996 AIDS drama. The Latin-fuelled \"Not Gonna Give into It\" eventually became heavily showcased in concert performance; \"The Way of Love\" was featured in the telefilm \"A Christmas Romance\", and \"Trust Yourself\" was incorporated into both the TV movie \"The Wilde Girls\" and the theatrical film \"Sordid Lives\".\nNewton-John was listed as president of the Isle of Man Basking shark Society between 1998 and 2005.\n1998\u20132012: Later releases.\nNewton-John continued to record and perform pop-oriented music as well. In 1998, she returned to Nashville to record \"Back with a Heart\" (No. 59 Pop). The album returned her to the top 10 (No. 9) on the Country Albums chart. Its first single was a re-recording of \"I Honestly Love You\" produced by David Foster and featuring Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds on background vocals that charted on the Pop (No. 67) and AC (No. 18) charts. Country radio dismissed the song, though it did peak at No. 16 on the Country Sales chart. The album track, \"Love Is a Gift\", won Newton-John a 1999 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song after being featured on the daytime serial, \"As the World Turns\".\nDuring October\u2013December 1998, Newton-John, John Farnham and Anthony Warlow performed in The Main Event Tour. The album \"Highlights from The Main Event\" peaked at No. 1 in December, was certified 4\u00d7 platinum, won an ARIA Award for Highest Selling Australian CD at the 1999 Awards and was also nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album.\nFor the 2000 Summer Olympics, Newton-John and Farnham re-teamed to perform \"Dare to Dream\" during the Parade of Nations at the Opening Ceremony. Broadcast of the ceremony was viewed by an estimated 3.5 billion people around the world.\nIn December 1998, following a hiatus of about 16 years, Newton-John also resumed touring by herself and in 2000 released a solo CD, \"One Woman's Live Journey\", her first live album since 1981's \"Love Performance\".\nIn 2000, she appeared in a dramatically different role as Bitsy Mae Harling, a bisexual former-convict country singer, in Del Shores' \"Sordid Lives\". Newton-John reprised her role for \"\" which aired one season on the LOGO television network. The series featured five original songs written and composed by Newton-John specifically for the show. In 2000, she teamed with Vince Gill and the London Symphony Orchestra for \"'Tis the Season\" sold exclusively through Hallmark. The following year, she released \"The Christmas Collection\", which compiled seasonal music previously recorded for her Hallmark Christmas album, her appearance on Kenny Loggins' 1999 TNN Christmas special and her contributions to the \"Mother and Child\" and \"Spirit of Christmas\" multi-artist collections.\nNewton-John's subsequent albums were released primarily in Australia. In 2002, she released \"(2)\", a duets album featuring mostly Australian artists (Tina Arena, Darren Hayes, Jimmy Little, Johnny O'Keefe, Billy Thorpe and Keith Urban), as well as a \"duet\" with the deceased Peter Allen. In addition, \"(2)\" offered a hidden 12th track, a samba version of \"Physical\" which Newton-John later performed occasionally in concert instead of the more rock-style original. The album's 2004 Japanese release includes the bonus track \"Let It Be Me\", a duet with Cliff Richard with whom she had previously been coupled on \"Suddenly\" and \"Songs from Heathcliff\".\nIn 2002, Newton-John was also inducted into Australia's ARIA Hall of Fame.\nProduced by Phil Ramone and recorded at the Indigo Recording Studios in Malibu for ONJ Productions, \"\" was released in October 2004 in Australia. The tribute album featured Newton-John covering songs by artists such as Joan Baez, the Carpenters, Doris Day, Nina Simone and Minnie Riperton. She dedicated the album to her mother, who had died the previous year of breast cancer. \"Indigo\" was subsequently released in the UK in April 2005 and in Japan in March 2006. A rebranded and resequenced version called \"Portraits: A Tribute to Great Women of Song\" was eventually issued in the United States in 2011.\nIn 2005, she released \"Stronger Than Before\", sold exclusively in the United States by Hallmark. This was her second exclusive album for Hallmark Cards after her successful first Christmas album \"Tis the Season\" with Vince Gill five years earlier. Proceeds from the album's sales benefited breast cancer research. The album featured the song \"Phenomenal Woman,\" based on the poem by Maya Angelou, and guest vocals from Diahann Carroll, Beth Nielsen Chapman, Delta Goodrem, Amy Holland, Patti LaBelle and Mindy Smith\u2014all survivors of or affected by cancer.\nIn 2006, Newton-John released a healing CD, \"Grace and Gratitude\". The album was sold exclusively by Walgreens, also to benefit various charities including Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization. The CD was the \"heart\" of their \"Body\u00a0\u2013 Heart\u00a0\u2013 Spirit\" Wellness Collection, which also featured a re-branded Liv-Kit and breast-health dietary supplements.\nIn 2007, she re-teamed with her \"Grace and Gratitude\" producer, Amy Sky, for \"Christmas Wish\" (No. 187 Pop) which was sold exclusively by Target in its first year of release. Newton-John released another concert DVD, \"Olivia Newton-John and the Sydney Symphony: Live at the Sydney Opera House\" and a companion CD, her third live album titled \"Olivia's Live Hits\".\nIn 2008, she raised funds to help build the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Melbourne, Australia. She led a three-week, 228\u00a0km walk along the Great Wall of China during April, joined by various celebrities and cancer survivors throughout her trek. She released a companion CD, \"A Celebration in Song\", the following month in Australia and later worldwide, featuring new and previously recorded duets by \"Olivia Newton-John &amp; Friends\", including Jann Arden, Jimmy Barnes, John Farrar, Barry Gibb, Delta Goodrem, Sun Ho, Richard Marx, Cliff Richard, Melinda Schneider, Amy Sky, and Keith Urban.\nIn 2008, Newton-John took part in the BBC Wales program \"Coming Home\" about her Welsh family history. Also, in 2008, Newton-John joined Anne Murray on Murray's last album, titled \"\". She sang Gordon Lightfoot's hit \"Cotton Jenny\" with Murray.\nShe re-recorded some tracks from \"Grace and Gratitude\" in 2010 and re-released the album as \"Grace and Gratitude Renewed\" on the Green Hill music label. The \"Renewed\" CD includes a new track, \"Help Me to Heal\", not featured on the original album.\nNewton-John was featured in UniGlobe Entertainment's breast cancer docu-drama, \"1 a Minute\", released in October 2010. The documentary was made by actress Namrata Singh Gujral and featured other celebrities who had survived breast cancer or who were affected by the disease. During the same month, Bluewater Productions released a comic book featuring Newton-John to coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\nIn 2010, Newton-John starred in the film \"\", released in Canada. She portrayed Hope Gordon, the mother of a home-schooled hockey prodigy. The film opened the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.\nNewton-John guest-starred as herself in the sitcoms \"Ned and Stacey\", \"Murphy Brown\" and \"Bette\" and also made two appearances as herself on \"Glee\".\nFor her first \"Glee\" appearance, Newton-John recreated her \"Physical\" video with series regular Jane Lynch. The performance was released as a digital single which peaked at number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 2010. In Australia, Newton-John hosted the animal and nature series \"Wild Life\" and guest-starred as Joanna on two episodes of the Australian series \"The Man From Snowy River\".\nIn January 2011, Newton-John began filming the comedy \"A Few Best Men\" in Australia with director Stephan Elliott, in the role of mother of the bride. The groom is played by Xavier Samuel.\n2012\u20132022: Vegas residency and final releases.\nNewton-John was actively touring and doing concerts from 2012 to 2017 and also performed a handful of shows in 2018. Her dates for A Summer Night with Olivia Newton-John even included stops in Asia and Canada and culminated in a rare concert appearance in London in 2013. Her March 2013 UK trek also encompassed Bournemouth, Brighton, Birmingham, Manchester and Cardiff, Wales.\nIn November 2012, Newton-John teamed with John Travolta to make the charity album \"This Christmas\", in support of The Olivia Newton-John Cancer &amp; Wellness Centre and the Jett Travolta Foundation. Artists featured on the album include: Barbra Streisand, James Taylor, Chick Corea, Kenny G, Tony Bennett, Cliff Richard and the Count Basie Orchestra.\nA 2013 residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas was postponed due to the May 2013 death of her elder sister, Rona (aged 72), from a brain tumour. Newton-John resumed performing, doing 45 shows beginning in April 2014. Along with the Vegas shows, Newton-John released a new EP in April 2014 entitled \"Hotel Sessions\", which consisted of seven tracks of unreleased demos that were recorded between 2002 and 2011 with her nephew Brett Goldsmith. The CD contains a cover of \"Broken Wings\" as well as the popular-with-fans original \"Best of My Love\", which had leaked on the internet many years prior.\nHer Vegas stay was eventually extended beyond August 2014, and her Summer Nights residency finished in December 2016 after 175 shows. Her successful three-year run even prompted a fourth live album, \"Summer Nights: Live in Las Vegas\" (2015). In 2015, Newton-John also reunited with John Farnham for a joint venture called \"Two Strong Hearts Live\".\nIn 2015, Newton-John was a guest judge on an episode of \"RuPaul's Drag Race\". That same year, she scored her first number-one single on \"Billboard\"'s Dance Club Songs chart with \"You Have to Believe\" with daughter Chloe and producer Dave Aud\u00e9. The song was a re-imagining of her 1980 single \"Magic\", which she noted was to celebrate both the 35th anniversary of \"Xanadu\" and as a dedication to her daughter. About the latter, Newton-John stated: \"I met Chloe's dad on the set of \"Xanadu;\" so, without that film, Chloe wouldn't be here. She was the real 'magic' that came out of that film!\" The song became the first mother-daughter single to reach No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Dance Club Play chart.\nIn 2015, Newton-John was inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.\nIn 2017, she collaborated with two North American singer-songwriters, Beth Nielsen Chapman and Amy Sky, on a joint concert tour entitled Liv On after co-producing a 2016 CD by the same name.\nOn 7 May 2019, Newton-John's elder brother Hugh, a doctor, died at age 80; his death left Newton-John as the sole surviving sibling from the original family.\nIn recognition for \"her work as an entertainer and philanthropist\", she was bestowed Australia's highest honour, the Companion of the Order of Australia, in June 2019.\nIn December 2019, Newton-John and Travolta also re-teamed for three live Meet 'n' Grease sing-along events in the Florida cities of Tampa, West Palm Beach and Jacksonville. Subsequently, a sing-along re-broadcast of \"Grease\" aired on CBS Television.\nIn February 2020, Newton-John appeared at the Fire Fight Australia charity event. This was her final public performance.\nIn January 2021, Newton-John released her final single, \"Window in the Wall\", a duet about unity which she recorded with her daughter Chloe Lattanzi. The music video for the song peaked at No. 1 on the iTunes pop music video chart the week of its release.\nIn the media.\nOn 2 November 2019, Julien's Auctions auctioned hundreds of memorabilia items from Newton-John's career. The sale raised $2.4 million. Newton-John's \"Grease\" outfit garnered $405,700; her pants and jacket were purchased separately by two different billionaires. Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx, bought Newton-John's black skintight pants from \"Grease\" for $162,000. The anonymous buyer who acquired her famous \"Grease\" leather jacket for $243,200 (\u00a3185,000) returned the item to her and said: \"It should not sit in a billionaire's closet for country-club bragging rights [...] The odds of beating a recurring cancer using the newest emerging therapies is a thousandfold greater than someone appearing out of the blue, buying your most famous and cherished icon, and returning it to you.\" All proceeds were donated to her Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Australia.\nIn December 2024 and January 2025, Julien's and TCM also held posthumous sales of Newton-John commemoratives.\nMusical legacy.\nNewton-John's first boyfriend, Ian Turpie, once said of her early appearances: \"In those days she had a small voice, but it was very pure. She could sing prettily in tune...The improvement in her singing since she went to England has been remarkable. She told me Shirley Bassey has been a big influence on her. After hearing Bassey, she worked at developing her head voice to sound like a chest voice, the way Bassey uses hers. The power she's developed is amazing\".\nMichael Dwyer of the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" maintains that following Newton-John's career was like watching \"our slightly older and braver sister growing up in public\" and her passing \"feels today like a lost member of the family\". Rachel Syme of \"The New Yorker\" also suggests that her familial, down-to-earth demeanor and humanity may have even superseded her singing accomplishments: \"Her most lasting legacy might be as the rare celebrity who was almost universally well liked, and thought of as an essentially kind and warmhearted person\".\nHer musical abilities on their own merits were also impressive. In her 1982 \"Olivia in Concert\" performance of Dolly Parton's \"Jolene,\" Newton-John showcases a down-falling note range covering three octaves. (Much later, Newton-John and Parton recorded a duet of \"Jolene,\" which was not formally released until after Newton-John's death.) In her memoir, Newton-John describes herself as \"not a power singer but more of an interpretive one\"; and author Lauren O'Neill concurs: \"She sang with clarity and precision, her high notes bright and open like a window on a summer morning, but her voice was never clinical \u2013 a sultry purr, euphoric cry or breathy gasp seemed always available to her...Her vocal [on \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" from \"Grease\"] is clean and soaring, but to hear it is to be right down in the dirt with Sandy too; to feel, and perhaps even identify with, her total frustration with herself. As she slides between notes while singing 'I'm out of my head,' she shows us her emotional freefall as well as telling us about it.\"\nLong before and after the career summit of \"Grease\", Newton-John proved herself to be a fairly versatile performer, lending her instrument to everything from sentimental ballads and New Age soul searching to lively dance productions and rock &amp; soul fervor. Maura Johnston of \"Vulture\" assesses: \"Newton-John was a regular chart-topper...throughout the '70s, her lithe soprano adapting well to the soft pop sound\" of the era with \"\"AM Gold\" staples and tracks from the folk and country world...As it turned out, Newton-John's voice was pretty well suited to the spiky dance pop that would become popular in the early 1980s\" too. However, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the \"Los Angeles Times\" offers a counterpoint on her career decline in the mid-1980s: \"Hardness never was Newton-John's comfort zone, though, and the 1980s were a much harder decade than the 1970s. The inherent warmth of 1970s studio sessions gave way to the cold, synthesized gleam of the 1980s, a sterile sound that suited her well only once: the candied faux-new wave of 'Twist of Fate'\", produced by David Foster. Johnston further maintains: \"Her pop heyday transcended any attempts to musically pigeonhole her\"; and by the time she stopped having many new hits, \"her musical legacy ... had been pretty well solidified.\"\nNewton-John's work has inspired many other female vocalists, including Juliana Hatfield, Lisa Loeb, Kylie Minogue, Delta Goodrem, Natalie Maines and Alanis Morissette. Pink staged a commemorative Newton-John cover during the 2022 American Music Awards. At the 2022 ARIA Music Awards, a special tribute in her honour featured performances by Natalie Imbruglia, Peking Duk and Tones and I.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships.\nIn the mid-1960s, Newton-John dated Australian actor and singer Ian Turpie, her co-star in the 1965 musical film \"Funny Things Happen Down Under\". They met in 1963 when Turpie attended the coffee shop where Newton-John's group Sol Four performed. The relationship continued until she returned to England in 1966.\nIn 1968, Newton-John was engaged to but never married Bruce Welch, one of her early producers and co-writer of her hit \"Please Mr. Please\". In 1972, Newton-John ended her relationship with Welch, who subsequently attempted suicide.\nIn 1973, while vacationing on the French Riviera, Newton-John met British businessman Lee Kramer, who became both her new boyfriend and manager. Newton-John lived with Kramer on and off and they stayed a couple until 1979; she called their turbulent pairing \"one long breakup\". Kramer subsequently returned to England and married. He also managed vocalist Krishna Das. Kramer died in 2017.\nNewton-John married her long-time, live-in partner, actor Matt Lattanzi, in December 1984. The pair had met in 1980 while filming \"Xanadu\". They announced their separation in April 1995, and they divorced in 1996. The couple remained friends. Their daughter, Chloe Rose, was born in January 1986.\nNewton-John met gaffer/cameraman Patrick McDermott soon after her divorce from Lattanzi. They dated on and off for nine years. McDermott vanished during a 2005 fishing trip off the Californian coast. Newton-John was in Australia at her Gaia Retreat &amp; Spa at the time of McDermott's disappearance. A United States Coast Guard investigation, based on then-available evidence and released in 2008, pointed to McDermott having been lost at sea. Various unsubstantiated claims have been made that he faked his own death.\nIn 1993, Newton-John met John Easterling, founder and president of the Amazon Herb Company, which he started in 1990 and sold to TriVita in 2012. Also known as \"Amazon John\", Easterling initially marketed rainforest botanicals and later owned Happy Tree Microbes, which offered natural plant performance products. When Newton-John and Easterling first met, they were both married to other people. In 2007, they started dating and married in an Incan spiritual ceremony in Peru on 21 June 2008, followed by a legal ceremony nine days later (30 June 2008) on Jupiter Island, Florida.\nResidences and citizenship.\nAlthough principally raised in Australia, Newton-John remained a British subject throughout her childhood. She initially pursued Australian citizenship in 1981 with an application that Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was asked to expedite. However, she finally became an Australian citizen in 1994.\nAfter relocating from England to the United States in late 1974, Newton-John set up residence in Malibu, California, where for 35 years she owned various real estate, including a horse ranch and several beachfront properties.\nIn June 2009, Newton-John and her second husband, John Easterling, purchased a new $4.1 million home in Jupiter Inlet, Florida. In 2013, while renovations were being done on the property and the couple was not there, a contractor committed suicide on the estate, which at the time was up for sale. Following the death on the premises, Newton-John and Easterling bought a nearby condo; their larger home lingered on and off the market for two years but was eventually sold in 2015 to a Swedish advertising executive for $5 million.\nIn 2015, the couple purchased a $5.3 million, 12-acre horse ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley outside Santa Barbara. Her widower sold the estate, known as Indian Way, in early 2025 for $7.9 million.\nIn 2019, Newton-John sold her 187-acre Australian farm, which she had owned for nearly 40 years and is located near Byron Bay in New South Wales . The Dalwood estate sold for $4.6 million; in 1980, Newton-John had paid $622,000 for the property, which had additional land adjoined in both 1983 and in 2002.\nNewton-John was also partial owner of Byron Bay's Gaia Retreat &amp; Spa, which was founded in 2005 and sold in 2021 for $30 million to the investment firm of Tattarang.\nWhen asked in 2017 whether she considered herself to be a British, Australian, or American citizen, she said, \"I am still Australian.\" In December 2019, upon being given the title of Dame, she expressed her thanks by stating: \"As a girl born in Cambridge [England], I am very proud of my British ancestry and so appreciative to be recognised in this way by the United Kingdom.\"\nIllness and death.\nIn May 2017, it was announced that Newton-John's breast cancer had returned and metastasised to her lower back. Her back pains had initially been diagnosed as sciatica. She subsequently revealed this was actually her third bout with breast cancer, as she had experienced a recurrence of the disease in 2013 in addition to her initial 1992 diagnosis. With the 2017 recurrence, the cancer had spread to her bones and progressed to stage IV. Newton-John experienced significant pain from the metastatic bone lesions and had spoken of using cannabis oil to ease her pain. She was an advocate for the use of medical cannabis; her daughter Chloe owns a cannabis farm in Oregon.\nNewton-John died on 8 August 2022, at the age of 73, at her home in the Santa Ynez Valley of California. Tributes were paid by John Travolta, Barbra Streisand, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and many other celebrities. As a mark of respect, Melbourne and Sydney lit up many of their landmarks.\nIn September 2022, Newton-John's family held a \"small and very private\" memorial service in California for the singer, who asked to be cremated and have her ashes scattered in Byron Bay, on her Santa Ynez ranch, and \"in other places that I love\".\nThe State of Victoria offered Newton-John's family a state funeral, which her niece Tottie Goldsmith accepted. Newton-John's Australian memorial service, hosted by David Campbell, was held on 26 February 2023, at Hamer Hall in Melbourne and included eulogies from her widower and daughter; a testimonial to her strength of character, optimism and magnanimity by television personality Richard Wilkins; montages of her career, family life and wellness centre; a medley of her hits performed by Delta Goodrem, and pre-recorded video tributes from Elton John, Mariah Carey, Barry Gibb, Dolly Parton and Nicole Kidman.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTours.\nHeadlining\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCo-headlining\nResidency show\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "53258", "revid": "43908893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53258", "title": "Pythia", "text": "Priestess of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece\nPythia (; ) was the title of the high priestess of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi in central Greece. She served as its oracle and was known as the Oracle of Delphi. Her title was sometimes historically glossed in English as the Pythoness.\nThe Pythia was established at the latest in the 8th century BC (though some estimates date the shrine to as early as 1400 BC), and was widely credited for her prophecies uttered under divine possession (\"enthusiasmos\") by Apollo. The Pythian priestess emerged as pre-eminent by the end of the 7th century BC and continued to be consulted until the late 4th century AD. During this period, the Delphic Oracle was the most prestigious and authoritative oracle among the Greeks, and she was among the most powerful women of the classical world. The oracle is one of the best-documented religious institutions of the classical Greeks. Authors who mention the oracle include Aeschylus, Aristotle, Clement of Alexandria, Diodorus, Diogenes, Euripides, Herodotus, Julian, Justin, Livy, Lucan, Nepos, Ovid, Pausanias, Pindar, Plato, Plutarch, Sophocles, Strabo, Thucydides, and Xenophon.\nNevertheless, details of how the Pythia operated are scarce, missing, or non-existent, as authors from the classical period (6th to 4th centuries BC) treat the process as common knowledge with no need to explain. Those who discussed the oracle in any detail are from 1st century BC to 4th century AD and give conflicting stories. One of the main stories claimed that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied or ecstatic state induced by vapours rising from an opening in the rock, and that she spoke gibberish. Priests interpreted her utterances as enigmatic prophecies and recomposed them into verse as dactylic hexameter, many of which are preserved in Greek literature. This idea, however, has been challenged by scholars such as Joseph Fontenrose and Lisa Maurizio, who argue that the ancient sources uniformly represent the Pythia speaking intelligibly, and giving prophecies in her own voice. Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC, describes the Pythia speaking in dactylic hexameters.\nName.\nThe name \"Pythia\" is derived from \"pythia hiereia\" (), meaning 'priestess of the Pythian Apollo'; it is related to \"Pythios\" (), an epithet of Apollo, itself deriving from \"Pytho\", which in myth was the original name of Delphi. As such, the word is likely related to Python, the name of the mythical snake that was slain by Apollo near Delphi. Etymologically, the Greeks derived this place name from the verb () 'to rot', which refers to the sickly sweet smell from the decomposing body of the monstrous Python after it was slain by Apollo.\nOrigins.\nThe Delphic oracle may have been present in some form from 1400 BC, in the middle period of Mycenaean Greece (1750\u20131050 BC). There is evidence that Apollo supposedly took over the shrine with the arrival of priests from Delos in the 8th century, from an earlier dedication to Gaia. The 8th-century reformulation of the Oracle at Delphi as a shrine to Apollo seems associated with the rise in importance of the city of Corinth and the importance of sites in the Corinthian Gulf.\nThe earliest account of the origin of the Delphic oracle is provided in the Homeric Hymn to Delphic Apollo, which recent scholarship dates within a narrow range, c. 580\u2013570 BC. It describes in detail how Apollo chose his first priests, whom he selected in their \"swift ship\"; they were \"Cretans from Minos' city of Knossos\" who were voyaging to sandy Pylos. But Apollo, who had as one of his cult epithets, leapt into the ship in the form of a dolphin (, gen. ). Dolphin-Apollo revealed himself to the terrified Cretans and bade them follow him up to the \"place where you will have rich offerings\". The Cretans \"danced in time and followed, singing , like the paeans of the Cretans in whose breasts the divine Muse has placed \"honey-voiced singing\". \"Paean\" seems to have been the name by which Apollo was known in Mycenaean times.\nG. L. Huxley observes: \"If the hymn to (Delphic) Apollo conveys a historical message, it is above all that there were once Cretan priests at Delphi.\" Robin Lane Fox notes that Cretan bronzes are found at Delphi from the eighth century onwards, and Cretan sculptures are dedicated as late as c. 620\u2013600 BC: \"Dedications at the site cannot establish the identity of its priesthood, but for once we have an explicit text to set beside the archaeological evidence.\" An early visitor to these \"dells of Parnassus\", at the end of the eighth century, was Hesiod, who was shown the \"omphalos\".\nThere are many later stories of the origins of the Delphic Oracle. One late explanation, which is first related by the 1st century BC writer Diodorus Siculus, tells of a goat herder named Coretas, who noticed one day that one of his goats, who fell into a crack in the earth, was behaving strangely. On entering the chasm, he found himself filled with a divine presence and the ability to see outside of the present, into the past and the future. Excited by his discovery, he shared it with nearby villagers. Many started visiting the site to experience the convulsions and inspirational trances, though some were said to disappear into the cleft due to their frenzied state. A shrine was erected at the site, where people began worshipping in the late Bronze Age, by 1600 BC. After the deaths of a number of men, the villagers chose a single young woman as the liaison for the divine inspirations. Eventually, she came to speak on behalf of the gods.\nAccording to earlier myths, the office of the oracle was initially possessed by the goddesses Themis and Phoebe, and the site was initially sacred to Gaia. Subsequently, it was believed to be sacred to Poseidon, the god of earthquakes. During the Greek Dark Age, from the 11th to the 9th century BC, a new god of prophecy, Apollo, was said to have seized the temple and expelled the twin guardian serpents of Gaia, whose bodies he wrapped around the caduceus. Later myths stated that Phoebe or Themis had \"given\" the site to Apollo, rendering its seizure by priests of the new god justified, but presumably having to retain the priestesses of the original oracle because of the long tradition. It is possible that the myths portray Poseidon as mollified by the gift of a new site in Troizen.\nDiodorus explained how, initially, the Pythia was an appropriately clad young virgin, for great emphasis was placed on the Oracle's chastity and purity to be reserved for union with the god Apollo. But he reports one story as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Echecrates the Thessalian, having arrived at the shrine and beheld the virgin who uttered the oracle, became enamoured of her because of her beauty, carried her away and violated her; and that the Delphians because of this deplorable occurrence passed a law that in the future a virgin should no longer prophesy but that an elderly woman of fifty would declare the Oracles and that she would be dressed in the costume of a virgin, as a sort of reminder of the prophetess of olden times.\nThe scholar Martin Litchfield West writes that the Pythia shows many traits of shamanistic practices, likely inherited or influenced from Central Asian practices, although there is no evidence of any such association at this time. He cites the Pythia sitting in a cauldron on a tripod, while making her prophecies in an ecstatic trance state, like shamans, and her utterings unintelligible.\nAccording to William Godwin, the tripod was perforated with holes, and as she inhaled the vapors, her figure would seem to enlarge, her hair stood on end, her complexion changed, her heart panted, her bosom swelled, and her voice became seemingly more than human.\nOrganization of the Oracle.\nPriestess.\nSince the first operation of the oracle of the Temple of Delphi, it was believed that the god lived within a laurel, his holy plant, and gave oracles for the future with the rustling of the leaves. It was also said that the art of divination had been taught to the god by the three winged sisters of Parnassus, the Thriae, at the time when Apollo was grazing his cattle there. The Thriae used to have a (an oracle by lot, or cleromancy) in that area in the past and it is possible that such was the first oracle of Delphi: throwing lots in a container, then pulling lots, the color and shape of which were of particular meaning and import.\nThree oracles had successively operated in Delphi \u2013 the using (a procedure that involved sleeping in the holy place, so as to experience a revealing dream), the and finally the Apollonian, with the laurel. But ever since the introduction of the cult of Dionysus at Delphi, the god that brought his followers into ecstasy and madness, the Delphic god gave oracles through Pythia, who also fell into a trance under the influence of vapors and fumes coming from the opening, the inner sanctum of the Oracle. Pythia sat on top of a tall gilded tripod that stood above the opening. In the old days, Pythia was a virgin, young girl, but after Echecrates of Thessaly kidnapped and violated a young and beautiful Pythia in the late 3rd century BC, a woman older than fifty years old was chosen, who dressed and wore jewelry to resemble a young maiden girl. According to tradition, Phemonoe was the first Pythia.\nThough little is known of how the priestess was chosen, the Pythia was probably selected, at the death of her predecessor, from amongst a guild of priestesses of the temple. These women were all natives of Delphi and were required to have had a sober life and be of good character. Although some were married, upon assuming their role as the Pythia, the priestesses ceased all family responsibilities, marital relations, and individual identity. In the heyday of the oracle, the Pythia may have been a woman chosen from an influential family, well educated in geography, politics, history, philosophy, and the arts. During later periods, however, uneducated peasant women were chosen for the role, which may explain why the poetic pentameter or hexameter prophecies of the early period were later made only in prose. Often, the priestess's answers to questions would be put into hexameter by a priest. The archaeologist John Hale reports that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the Pythia was (on occasion) a noble of aristocratic family, sometimes a peasant, sometimes rich, sometimes poor, sometimes old, sometimes young, sometimes a very lettered and educated woman to whom somebody like the high priest and the philosopher Plutarch would dedicate essays, other times who could not write her own name. So it seems to have been aptitude rather than any ascribed status that made these women eligible to be Pythias and speak for the god.\nThe job of a priestess, especially the Pythia, was a respectable career for Greek women. Priestesses enjoyed many liberties and rewards for their social position, such as freedom from taxation, the right to own property and attend public events, a salary and housing provided by the state, a wide range of duties depending on their affiliation, and often gold crowns.\nDuring the main period of the oracle's popularity, as many as three women served as Pythia, another vestige of the triad, with two taking turns in giving prophecy and another kept in reserve. Only one day of the month could the priestess be consulted.\nPlutarch said that the Pythia's life was shortened through the service of Apollo. The sessions were said to be exhausting. At the end of each period the Pythia would be like a runner after a race or a dancer after an ecstatic dance, which may have had a physical effect on the health of the Pythia.\nOther officiants.\nSeveral other officiants served the oracle in addition to the Pythia. After 200 BC, at any given time, there were two priests of Apollo, who were in charge of the entire sanctuary; Plutarch, who served as a priest during the late first century and early second century AD, gives us the most information about the organization of the oracle at that time. Before 200 BC, while the temple was dedicated to Apollo, there was probably only one priest of Apollo. Priests were chosen from among the main citizens of Delphi, and were appointed for life. In addition to overseeing the oracle, priests would also conduct sacrifices at other festivals of Apollo, and had charge of the Pythian Games. Earlier arrangements, before the temple became dedicated to Apollo, are not documented.\nThe other officiants associated with the oracle are less well known. These are the ' (, 'holy ones') and the ' (, singular ). is the origin of the English word \"prophet\", with the meaning 'one who forespeaks, one who foretells'. The are referred to in literary sources, but their function is unclear; it has been suggested that they interpreted the Pythia's prophecies, or even reformatted her utterances into verse, but it has also been argued that the term \"\" is a generic reference to any cult officials of the sanctuary, including the Pythia. There were five , whose responsibilities are unknown, but may have been involved in some manner with the operation of the oracle.\nOracular procedure.\nIn the traditions associated with Apollo, the oracle gave prophecies during the nine warmest months of each year. During winter months, Apollo was said to have deserted his temple, his place being taken by his divine half-brother Dionysus, whose tomb was also within the temple. It is not known whether the Oracle participated with the Dionysian rites of the Maenads or Thyades in the Korykion cave on Mount Parnassos, although Plutarch informs us that his friend Clea was both a Priestess to Apollo and to the secret rites of Dionysus. The male priests seem to have had their own ceremonies to the dying and resurrecting god. Apollo was said to return at the beginning of spring, on the seventh day of the month of Bysios, his birthday. This would reiterate the absences of the great goddess Demeter in winter also, which would have been a part of the earliest traditions.\nOnce a month, thereafter, the oracle would undergo purification rites, including fasting, to ceremonially prepare the Pythia for communications with the divine. On the seventh day of each month, she would be led by two attended oracular priests, with her face veiled in purple. A priest would then declaim:\n&lt;poem&gt;Servant of the Delphian Apollo\nGo to the Castallian Spring\nWash in its silvery eddies,\nAnd return cleansed to the temple.\nGuard your lips from offence\nTo those who ask for oracles.\nLet the God's answer come\nPure from all private fault.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe Pythia would then bathe naked in the Castalian Spring, then drink the holier waters of the Cassotis, which flowed closer to the temple, where a naiad possessing magical powers was said to live. Euripides described this ritual purification ceremony, starting first with the priest Ion dancing on the highest point of Mount Parnassus, going about his duties within the temple, and sprinkling the temple floor with holy water. The purification ceremonies always were performed on the seventh day of the month, which was sacred to and associated with the god Apollo. Then, escorted by the , an aristocratic council of five, with a crowd of oracular servants, they would arrive at the temple. Consultants, carrying laurel branches sacred to Apollo, approached the temple along the winding upward course of the Sacred Way, bringing a young goat for sacrifice in the forecourt of the temple, and a monetary fee.\nInscribed on a column in the pronaos (forecourt) of the temple were an enigmatic \"E\" and three maxims:\nThese seem to have played an important part in the temple ritual. According to Plutarch's essay on the meaning of the \"E at Delphi\" (the only literary source for the E inscription), there have been various interpretations of this letter. In ancient times, the origin of these phrases was attributed to one or more of the Seven Sages of Greece.\nPythia would then remove her purple veil. She would wear a short plain white dress. At the temple fire to Hestia, a goat would be set in front of the altar and be sprinkled with water. If the goat shook off the water it was considered a good omen for the oracle, but if it did not, the enquirer was considered to have been rejected by the god and the consultation was terminated. If it were a good omen, however, the goat would subsequently be sacrificed to Apollo. In turn, the animal's organs, particularly its liver, were examined to ensure the signs were favorable, and then burned outside on the altar of Chios. The rising smoke was a signal that the oracle was open. The Oracle then descended into the \"adyton\" (Greek for 'inaccessible') and mounted her tripod seat, holding laurel leaves and a dish of Kassotis spring water into which she gazed. Nearby was the \"omphalos\" (Greek for 'navel'), which was flanked by two solid gold eagles representing the authority of Zeus, and the cleft from which emerged the sacred pneuma.\nPetitioners drew lots to determine the order of admission, but representatives of a city-state or those who brought larger donations to Apollo were secured a higher place in line. Each person approaching the oracle was accompanied with a specific to the state of the petitioner, whose job was to identify the citizen of their . This service, too, was paid for.\nPlutarch describes the events of one session in which the omens were ill-favored, but the Oracle was consulted nonetheless. The priests proceeded to receive the prophecy, but the result was a hysterical uncontrollable reaction from the priestess that resulted in her death a few days later.\nAt times when the Pythia was not available, consultants could obtain guidance by asking simple yes-or-no questions to the priests. A response was returned through the tossing of colored beans, one color designating \"yes\", another \"no\". Little else is known of this practice.\nBetween 535 and 615 of the Oracles (statements) of Delphi are known to have survived since classical times, of which over half are said to be accurate historically (see List of oracular statements from Delphi for examples).\nCicero noted no expedition was undertaken, no colony sent out, and no affair of any distinguished individuals went on without the sanction of the oracle.\nThe early fathers of the Christian church believed demons were allowed to assist them to spread idolatry so that the need for a savior would be more evident.\nExperience of supplicants.\nIn antiquity, the people who went to the Oracle to ask for advice were known as \"consultants\", literally, \"those who seek counsel\". It would appear that the supplicant to the oracle would undergo a four-stage process, typical of shamanic journeys.\nThe Role of Consultants.\nThe relationship between the Pythia, Delphic officials, and consultants who sought advice at the temple is shown in contemporary research on the Delphic Oracle. Individuals, city-states, and political officials were among the advisors. Additionally, they have actively contributed to the influence of the Pythia's oracular pronouncements. This interpretation challenges earlier views that considered the Delphic Oracle as a centralized political force that helps to exert a unilateral influence across the Greek and Mediterranean region. Instead, the production and interpretation of oracles emerge as collaborative processes involving multiple stakeholders. \nThe idea that Delphi\u2019s prominence as a religious and cultural center was strengthened by its reputation as the \u201cnavel of the world\u201d (omphalos). The Pythia was seen as providing a channel and connect between the divine and human realms, her words imbued with the authority of Apollo. Scholars such as Simon Hornblower suggest that the Delphic Oracle\u2019s influence extended beyond religion, serving as a mechanism for conflict resolution, interstate diplomacy, and political legitimation. However, this view often considered as overestimating the power of the Pythia and her attendant priests. Hence reducing the level of influence of the consultants to passive recipients of divine messages. Recent studies challenge this assumption by highlighting the role of consultants played in framing questions, interpreting responses, and implementing decisions during the process. \nIn modern theories, consultants shaped the form and content of oracles through their own political, social, and personal contexts. This dynamic undermines the notion of the oracle as an independent political force, instead stressing the shared agency between Delphic officials and those who sought the god\u2019s counsel.\nThe collaboration during Oracular Productions.\nIn order to provide an oracle, procedures that focused on cooperation between consultants and the Delphic priest will be carried out. Before posing their queries to the Pythia, consultants would engage in a purification and sacrifice ritual. These questions were carefully adjusted, often with guidance from the priests (proph\u0113tai), to align with the expectations of Apollo\u2019s wisdom. The Pythia that induced by divine possession or inhale sacred fumes will enter a trance state, hence delivered responses that were often ambiguous or cryptic. \nScholars argues that the Pythia\u2019s utterances were not unintelligible gibberish, as traditionally believed, but meaningful statements requiring collaborative decoding. The interpretation of these responses was shaped by the consultants\u2019 framing under the guidance of the priests. And hence to impact in sociopolitical context. The process helps to build connection between human and the divine, hence reducing the gap between people and gods. \nThe oracular text was not only a fixed and authoritative pronouncement. It was also subject to negotiation and reinterpretation. A well-documented example is the oracle granted to King Croesus of Lydia, which stated, \"If you cross the Halys, you will destroy a great empire.\" The king misinterpreted the statement, and Croesus started a catastrophic war that resulted in the collapse of his own empire after mistaking the words for a promise of triumph. This episode illustrates the ambiguity inherent in many oracles, which consultants often interpreted in ways that fulfills their desires or expectations. The text might be falsely interpreted for one's sake. \nConsultants were instrumental in shaping oracles by framing questions and selectively interpreting responses. This tackle questions conventional views of oracles as unilateral declarations of divine will, presenting them instead as dialogical and context dependent.\nModern Interpretations of the Pythia.\nModern interpretations of the Pythia emphasize her symbolic and ritualistic importance but sometimes neglect her direct involvement in political decision-making. Catherine Morgan notes that the Pythia\u2019s role was deeply embedded in the religious and cultural fabric of Greek society, serving as both a mediator of divine will and a symbol of Apollo\u2019s authority. \nThis shift reflects a deeper understanding of ancient Greek religion, recognizing the complexity of the Pythia\u2019s role as both a channel for Apollo\u2019s voice and an active participant in oracular practices.\nTemple of Apollo.\nThe ruins of the Temple of Delphi visible today date from the 4th century\u00a0 BC, and are of a peripteral Doric building. It was erected on the remains of an earlier temple, dated to the 6th century BC, which itself was erected on the site of a 7th-century-BC construction attributed to the architects Trophonios and Agamedes.\nThe 6th-century BC temple was named the \"Temple of Alcmaeonidae\" in tribute to the Athenian family who funded its reconstruction following a fire, which had destroyed the original structure. The new building was a Doric hexastyle temple of 6\u00a0by\u00a015 columns. This temple was destroyed in 373\u00a0 BC by an earthquake. The pediment sculptures are a tribute to Praxias and Androsthenes of Athens. Of a similar proportion to the second temple it retained the 6\u00a0by\u00a015 column pattern around the stylobate. Inside was the adyton, the centre of the Delphic oracle and seat of Pythia. The temple had the statement \"Know thyself\", one of the Delphic maxims, carved into it (and some modern Greek writers say the rest were carved into it), and the maxims were attributed to Apollo and given through the Oracle and/or the Seven Sages of Greece (\"know thyself\" perhaps also being attributed to other famous philosophers).\nThe temple survived until AD 390, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I silenced the oracle by destroying the temple and most statues and works of art to remove all traces of paganism.\nComparative Oracular Traditions.\nThe characteristic of collaboration of oracular practices at Delphi were found to be similar with other ancient traditions. For example, at Dodona, oracles were delivered through the rustling of oak leaves. Then priests will be required to interpret the signs. Similarly, the oracle at Didyma involved the interpretation of cryptic utterances by the priestess. This demonstrate that oracles across the ancient world relied on a interaction between divine inspiration which are signs from god, priestly mediation, and human interpretation.\nBy situating the Delphic Oracle within this broader context, scholars highlight its unique features while acknowledging its shared characteristics with other oracular traditions.\nScientific explanations.\nFumes and vapors.\nThere have been many attempts to find a scientific explanation for the Pythia's inspiration. Most commonly, these refer to an observation made by Plutarch, who presided as high priest at Delphi for several years, who stated that the oracular powers of the sybil appeared to be associated with vapors from the Kerna spring waters that flowed under the temple. It has often been suggested that these vapors may have been hallucinogenic gases.\nRecent geological investigations have suggested that gas emissions from a geologic chasm in the earth could have inspired the Delphic Oracle to \"connect with the divine\". Some researchers suggest the possibility that ethylene gas caused the Pythia's state of inspiration, based on the matching symptoms, ethylene's use as an anesthetic, and the smell of the chamber, as described by Plutarch. Traces of ethylene have been found in the waters of the Castallian spring, which is now largely diverted for the town water supply of the town of modern Delphi. However, Lehoux argues that ethylene is \"impossible\" and benzene is \"crucially underdetermined\". Others argue instead that methane might have been the gas emitted from the chasm, or CO2 and H2S, arguing that the chasm itself might have been a seismic ground rupture.\nOleander, in contemporary toxicological literature, has also been considered responsible for contributing symptoms similar to those of the Pythia. The Pythia used oleander as a complement during the oracular procedure, chewing its leaves and inhaling their smoke. The toxic substances of oleander results in symptoms similar to those of epilepsy, the \"sacred disease\", which could have amounted to the possession of the Pythia by the spirit of Apollo, rendering Pythia his spokesperson and prophetess. The oleander fumes (the \"spirit of Apollo\") could have originated in a brazier located in an underground chamber (the antron) and have escaped through an opening (the \"chasm\") in the temple's floor. This hypothesis fits the findings of the archaeological excavations that revealed an underground space under the temple. This explanation sheds light on the alleged spirit and chasm of Delphi, that have been the subject of intense debate and interdisciplinary research for the last hundred years.\nRegardless of which fumes existed in the chasm, winter months would bring cooler weather, decreasing release of gases in the chamber. This offers a plausible explanation for the absence of summer deities in winter months. A toxic gas also explains the reason why the Pythia could only venture into her oracular chamber once a month, both to coincide with the correct concentration of gases, and to prolong the already-short lifespan of the Pythia by limiting her exposure to such fumes.\nExcavations.\nBeginning during 1892, a team of French archaeologists directed by Th\u00e9ophile Homolle of the Coll\u00e8ge de France excavated the site at Delphi. Contrary to ancient literature, they found no fissure and no possible means for the production of fumes.\nAdolphe Paul Opp\u00e9 published an influential article in 1904, which made three crucial claims: No chasm or vapor ever existed; no natural gas could create prophetic visions; and the recorded incidents of a priestess undergoing violent and often deadly reactions was inconsistent with the more customary reports. Opp\u00e9 explained away all the ancient testimony as being reports of gullible travelers fooled by wily local guides who, Opp\u00e9 believed, invented the details of a chasm and a vapor in the first place.\nIn accordance with this definitive statement, such scholars as Frederick Poulson, E. R. Dodds, Joseph Fontenrose, and Saul Levin all stated that there were no vapors and no chasm. For the decades to follow, scientists and scholars believed the ancient descriptions of a sacred, inspiring pneuma to be fallacious. During 1950, the French hellenist Pierre Amandry, who had worked at Delphi and later directed the French excavations there, concurred with Opp\u00e9's pronouncements, claiming that gaseous emissions were not even possible in a volcanic zone such as Delphi. Neither Opp\u00e9 nor Amandry were geologists, though, and no geologists had been involved in the debate up to that point.\nSubsequent re-examination of the French excavations, however, has shown that this consensus may have been mistaken. Broad (2007) demonstrates that a French photograph of the excavated interior of the temple clearly depicts a springlike pool as well as a number of small vertical fissures, indicating numerous pathways by which vapors could enter the base of the temple.\nDuring the 1980s, the interdisciplinary team of geologist Jelle Zeilinga de Boer, archaeologist John R. Hale, forensic chemist Jeffrey P. Chanton, and toxicologist Henry R. Spiller investigated the site at Delphi using this photograph and other sources as evidence, as part of a United Nations survey of all active faults in Greece.\nJelle Zeilinga de Boer saw evidence of a fault line in Delphi that lay under the ruined temple.\nDuring several expeditions, they discovered two major fault lines, one lying north\u2013south, the Kerna fault, and the other lying east\u2013west, the Delphic fault, which parallels the shore of the Corinthian Gulf. The rift of the Gulf of Corinth is one of the most geologically active sites on Earth; shifts there impose immense strains on nearby fault lines, such as those below Delphi. The two faults cross one another, and they intersect right below where the was probably located. (The actual, original oracle chamber had been destroyed by the moving faults, but there is strong structural evidence that indicates where it was most likely located.)\nThey also found evidence for underground passages and chambers, and drains for spring water. Additionally, they discovered at the site formations of travertine, a form of calcite created when water flows through limestone and dissolves calcium carbonate, which is later redeposited. Further investigation revealed that deep beneath the Delphi region lies a bituminous deposit, rich in hydrocarbons and full of pitch, that has a petrochemical content as high as 20%. Friction created by earthquakes heat the bituminous layers resulting in vaporization of the hydrocarbons which rise to the surface through small fissures in the rock.\nIllusions in the \"\".\nIt has been disputed as to how the \"adyton\" was organized, but it appears clear that this temple was unlike any other in ancient Greece. The small chamber was located below the main floor of the temple and offset to one side, perhaps constructed specifically over the crossing faults. The intimate chamber allowed the escaping vapors to be contained in quarters close enough to provoke intoxicating effects. Plutarch reports that the temple was filled with a sweet smell when the \"deity\" was present:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Not often nor regularly, but occasionally and fortuitously, the room in which they seat the god's consultants is filled with a fragrance and breeze, as if the \"adyton\" were sending forth the essences of the sweetest and most expensive perfumes from a spring\u2014\u200a\nDe Boer's research caused him to propose ethylene as a gas known to possess this sweet odor. Toxicologist Henry R. Spiller stated that inhalation of even a small amount of ethylene can cause both benign trances and euphoric psychedelic experiences. Other effects include physical detachment, loss of inhibitions, the relieving of pain, and rapidly changing moods without dulling consciousness. He also noted that excessive doses can cause confusion, agitation, delirium, and loss of muscle coordination.\nAnesthesiologist Isabella Coler Herb found that a dose of ethylene gas up to 20% induced a trance in which subjects could sit up, hear questions and answer them logically, though with altered speech patterns, and they might lose some awareness and sensitivity in their hands and feet. After recovery, they had no recollection of what had happened. With a dose higher than 20%, the patients lost control over their limbs and might thrash wildly, groaning and staggering. All these hallucinogenic symptoms match Plutarch's description of the Pythia, whom he had witnessed many times.\nDuring 2001, water samples from the Kerna spring, uphill from the temple and now diverted to the nearby town of Delphi, yielded evidence of 0.3 parts per million of ethylene. It is likely that in ancient times, higher concentrations of ethylene or other gases emerged in the temple from these springs. While likely in the context of the ethylene gas theory, there is no evidence to support the diminishing ethylene concentration statement.\nFrequent earthquakes produced by Greece's location at the clashing intersection of three tectonic plates could have caused the observed cracking of the limestone, and the opening of new channels for hydrocarbons entering the flowing waters of the Kassotis. This would cause the admixture of ethylene to fluctuate, increasing and decreasing the potency of the drug. It has been suggested that the waning of the Oracle after the era of Roman Emperor Hadrian was due in part to a long period without earthquakes in the area.\nPolitical and Diplomatic Role of the Oracle.\nFor the oracle, the shrine\u2019s pan-Hellenic reputation relied on its perceived neutrality, which it maintained by avoiding overt favoritism toward specific city-states or factions. The oracle's statements tended to be ambiguous in an attempt to maintain neutrality. Such prophecies allowed for different interpretations or even possible misreadings. For example, during the Persian Wars, the Delphic Oracle Aristonice initially advised submission to the Persians. It is a stance reflecting the pro-Persian sentiments of some Delphic officials. However, the Athenian leaders reinterpreted subsequent oracles to rally Greek resistance.\nThis adaptability shows Delphic Oracle\u2019s role as a mediator rather than a direct political force. Consultants\u2019 interpretations often shaped the oracle\u2019s political impact, correlating its ambiguous messages with their agendas.\nModern scholarship continues to debate the Pythia\u2019s role in ancient Greek society. The discovery of geological explanations for her trance states has provided a scientific explanation for ancient myths in modern understanding.\nThis evolving interpretation of the Pythia reflects the growing understanding towards ancient religion, helping people to understand the complexity of the relations between God and people in ancient times. By re-evaluating the Pythia\u2019s role, they can be seen both a sacred symbol and an active participant in the oracular process.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\nModern sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
