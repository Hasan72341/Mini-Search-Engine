The protocol, part of the Internet protocol suite, was defined in 1982 by , which is Internet Standard STD 37.\nARP enables a host to send, for example, an IPv4 packet to another node in the local network by providing a protocol to get the MAC address associated with an IP address. The host broadcasts a request containing the target node's IP address, and the node with that IP address replies with its MAC address.\nARP has been implemented with many combinations of network and data link layer technologies, such as IPv4, Chaosnet, DECnet and Xerox PARC Universal Packet (PUP) using IEEE 802 standards, FDDI, X.25, Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).\nIn Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) networks, the functionality of ARP is provided by the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).\nOperating scope.\nThe Address Resolution Protocol is a request\u2013response protocol. Its messages are directly encapsulated by a link layer protocol. It is communicated within the boundaries of a single subnetwork and is never routed.\nPacket structure.\nThe Address Resolution Protocol uses a simple message format containing one address resolution request or response. The packets are carried at the data link layer of the underlying network as raw payload. In the case of Ethernet, a 0x0806 EtherType value is used to identify ARP frames.\nThe size of the ARP message depends on the link layer and network layer address sizes. The message header specifies the types of network in use at each layer as well as the size of addresses of each. The message header is completed with the operation code for request (1) and reply (2). The payload of the packet consists of four addresses, the hardware and protocol address of the sender and receiver hosts.\nThe principal packet structure of ARP packets is shown in the following table which illustrates the case of IPv4 networks running on Ethernet. In this scenario, the packet has 48-bit fields for the sender hardware address (SHA) and target hardware address (THA), and 32-bit fields for the corresponding sender and target protocol addresses (SPA and TPA). The ARP packet size in this case is 28 bytes.\n!style=\"min-width:42px; border-bottom:none; border-right:none;\"|\"Offset\"\n!style=\"border-left:none;\"|Octet\n!colspan=\"8\"|0\n!colspan=\"8\"|1\n!colspan=\"8\"|2\n!colspan=\"8\"|3\n!style=\"min-width: 42px;border-top: none;\"|Octet\n!style=\"min-width: 42px;\"|Bit\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|0\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|1\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|2\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|3\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|4\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|5\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|6\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|7\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|8\n!style=\"min-width:11px;\"|9\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|10\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|11\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|12\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|13\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|14\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|15\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|16\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|17\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|18\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|19\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|20\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|21\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|22\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|23\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|24\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|25\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|26\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|27\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|28\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|29\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|30\n!style=\"min-width:16px;\"|31\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|0\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|0\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|4\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|32\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|8\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|64\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|12\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|96\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|16\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|128\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|20\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|160\n!style=\"width:35px;\"|24\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|192\nARP parameter values have been standardized and are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\nThe EtherType for ARP is 0x0806. This appears in the Ethernet frame header when the payload is an ARP packet and is not to be confused with PTYPE, which appears within this encapsulated ARP packet.\nLayering.\nARP's placement within the Internet protocol suite and the OSI model may be a matter of confusion or even of dispute. places it into the link layer and characterizes it as a tool to inquire about the \"higher level layer\", such as the Internet layer. also discusses ARP in its link layer section.\nRichard Stevens places ARP in OSI's data link layer while newer editions associate it with the network layer or introduce an intermediate OSI layer 2.5.\nExample.\nTwo computers, \"A\" and \"B\", are connected to the same local area network with no intervening gateway or router. \"A\" has a packet to send to IP address which happens to be the address of \"B\".\nBefore sending the packet to \"B\", \"A\" broadcasts an ARP request message \u2013 addressed with the broadcast MAC address and requesting response from the node with IP address . All nodes of the network receive the message, but only \"B\" replies since it has the requested IP address. \"B\" responds with an ARP response message containing its MAC addresses which \"A\" receives. \"A\" sends the data packet on the link addressed with \"B\"'s MAC address.\nTypically, a network node maintains a lookup cache that associates IP and MAC addressees. In this example, if \"A\" had the lookup cached, then it would not need to broadcast the ARP request. Also, when \"B\" received the request, it could cache the lookup to \"A\" so that if \"B\" needs to send a packet to \"A\" later, it does not need to use ARP to lookup its MAC address. Finally, when \"A\" receives the ARP response, it can cache the lookup for future messages addressed to the same IP address.\nARP probe.\nAn ARP probe in IPv4 is an ARP request constructed with the SHA of the probing host, an SPA of all 0s, a THA of all 0s, and a TPA set to the IPv4 address being probed for. If some host on the network regards the IPv4 address (in the TPA) as its own, it will reply to the probe (via the SHA of the probing host) thus informing the probing host of the address conflict. If instead there is no host which regards the IPv4 address as its own, then there will be no reply. When several such probes have been sent, with slight delays, and none receive replies, it can reasonably be expected that no conflict exists. As the original probe packet contains neither a valid SHA/SPA nor a valid THA/TPA pair, there is no risk of any host using the packet to update its cache with problematic data. Before beginning to use an IPv4 address (whether received from manual configuration, DHCP, or some other means), a host implementing this specification must test to see if the address is already in use, by broadcasting ARP probe packets.\nARP announcements.\nARP may also be used as a simple announcement protocol. This is useful for updating other hosts' mappings of a hardware address when the sender's IP address or MAC address changes. Such an announcement, also called a gratuitous ARP (GARP) message, is usually broadcast as an \"ARP request\" containing the SPA in the target field (TPA=SPA), with THA set to zero. An alternative way is to broadcast an \"ARP reply\" with the sender's SHA and SPA duplicated in the target fields (TPA=SPA, THA=SHA).\nThe \"ARP request\" and \"ARP reply\" announcements are both standards-based methods, but the \"ARP request\" method is preferred. Some devices may be configured for the use of either of these two types of announcements.\nAn ARP announcement is not intended to solicit a reply; instead, it updates any cached entries in the ARP tables of other hosts that receive the packet. The operation code in the announcement may be either request or reply; the ARP standard specifies that the opcode is only processed after the ARP table has been updated from the address fields.\nMany operating systems issue an ARP announcement during startup. This helps to resolve problems that would otherwise occur if, for example, a network card was recently changed (changing the IP-address-to-MAC-address mapping) and other hosts still have the old mapping in their ARP caches.\nARP announcements are also used by some network interfaces to provide load balancing for incoming traffic. In a team of network cards, it is used to announce a different MAC address within the team that should receive incoming packets.\nARP announcements can be used in the Zeroconf protocol to allow automatic assignment of a link-local address to an interface where no other IP address configuration is available. The announcements are used to ensure an address chosen by a host is not in use by other hosts on the network link.\nThis function can be dangerous from a cybersecurity viewpoint since an attacker can obtain information about the other hosts of its subnet to save in their ARP cache (ARP spoofing) an entry where the attacker MAC is associated, for instance, to the IP of the default gateway, thus allowing them to intercept all the traffic to external networks.\nARP mediation.\nARP mediation refers to the process of resolving layer-2 addresses through a virtual private wire service (VPWS) when different resolution protocols are used on the connected circuits, e.g., Ethernet on one end and Frame Relay on the other. In IPv4, each provider edge (PE) device discovers the IP address of the locally attached customer edge (CE) device and distributes that IP address to the corresponding remote PE device. Then each PE device responds to local ARP requests using the IP address of the remote CE device and the hardware address of the local PE device. In IPv6, each PE device discovers the IP address of both local and remote CE devices and then intercepts local Neighbor Discovery (ND) and Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND) packets and forwards them to the remote PE device.\nInverse ARP and Reverse ARP.\nInverse Address Resolution Protocol (Inverse ARP or InARP) is used to obtain network layer addresses (for example, IP addresses) of other nodes from data link layer (Layer 2) addresses. Since ARP translates layer-3 addresses to layer-2 addresses, InARP may be described as its inverse. In addition, InARP is implemented as a protocol extension to ARP: it uses the same packet format as ARP, but different operation codes.\nInARP is primarily used in Frame Relay (DLCI) and ATM networks, in which layer-2 addresses of virtual circuits are sometimes obtained from layer-2 signaling, and the corresponding layer-3 addresses must be available before those virtual circuits can be used.\nThe Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (Reverse ARP or RARP), like InARP, translates layer-2 addresses to layer-3 addresses. However, in InARP the requesting station queries the layer-3 address of another node, whereas RARP is used to obtain the layer-3 address of the requesting station itself for address configuration purposes. RARP is obsolete; it was replaced by BOOTP, which was later superseded by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).\nARP spoofing and proxy ARP.\nBecause ARP does not provide methods for authenticating ARP replies on a network, ARP replies can come from systems other than the one with the required Layer 2 address. An ARP \"proxy\" is a system that answers the ARP request on behalf of another system for which it will forward traffic, normally as a part of the network's design, such as for a dialup internet service. By contrast, in ARP \"spoofing\" the answering system, or \"spoofer\", replies to a request for another system's address with the aim of intercepting data bound for that system. A malicious user may use ARP spoofing to perform a man-in-the-middle or denial-of-service attack on other users on the network. Various software exists to both detect and perform ARP spoofing attacks, though ARP itself does not provide any methods of protection from such attacks.\nAlternatives.\nComputers may maintain lists of known addresses, rather than using an active protocol. In this method, each computer maintains a database of the mapping of Layer 3 addresses (e.g., IP addresses) to Layer 2 addresses (e.g., Ethernet MAC addresses). This data is maintained primarily by interpreting ARP packets from the local network link. Thus, it is often called the \"ARP cache\". Since at least the 1980s, networked computers have a utility called \"arp\" for interrogating or manipulating this database.\nHistorically, other methods were used to maintain the mapping between addresses, such as static configuration files, or centrally maintained lists.\nARP stuffing.\nEmbedded systems such as networked cameras and networked power distribution devices, which lack a user interface, can use so-called \"ARP stuffing\" to make an initial network connection, although this is a misnomer, as ARP is not involved.\nARP stuffing is accomplished as follows:\nSuch devices typically have a method to disable this process once the device is operating normally, as the capability can make it vulnerable to attack.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its source is in Trimbakeshwar, Nashik, Maharashtra. It flows east for , draining the states of Maharashtra (48.6%), Telangana (18.8%), Andhra Pradesh (4.5%), Chhattisgarh (10.9%) and Odisha (5.7%). The river ultimately empties into the Bay of Bengal through an extensive network of distributaries. Its drainage basin is one of the largest in the Indian subcontinent, with only the Ganga and Indus rivers having a larger drainage basin. In terms of length, catchment area and discharge, the Godavari is the largest in peninsular India, and had been dubbed as the Dakshina Ganga (Southern Ganges).\nThe river has been revered in Hindu scriptures for many millennia and continues to harbour and nourish a rich cultural heritage. In the past few decades, the river has been barricaded by several barrages and dams, keeping a head of water (depth) which lowers evaporation. Its broad river delta houses 729 persons/km2 \u2013 nearly twice the Indian average population density and has a substantial risk of flooding, which in lower parts would be exacerbated if the global sea level were to rise.\nCourse.\nThe Godavari originates in the Western Ghats of central India, near Nashik in Maharashtra, from the Arabian Sea. It flows for , first eastwards across the Deccan Plateau, then turns southeast, entering the Eluru district and Alluri Sitharama Raju district of Andhra Pradesh, until it splits into two distributaries that widen into a large river delta at Dhavaleshwaram Barrage, in Rajamahendravaram, and then flows into the Bay of Bengal.\nThe Godavari River has a coverage area of , which is nearly one-tenth of the area of India and is equivalent to the area of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland put together. The river basin is considered to be divided into 3 sections: \nThese put together account for 24.2% of the total basin area. The rivers annual average water inflows are nearly 110 billion cubic metres. Nearly 50% of the water availability is being harnessed. The water allocation from the river among the riparian states are governed by the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal. The river has highest flood flows in India and experienced recorded flood of 3.6 million cusecs in the year 1986 and annual flood of 1.0 million cusecs is normal.\nWithin Maharashtra.\nThe river originates in Maharashtra state and has an extensive course. The upper basin (origin to its confluence with Manjira), of which lies entirely within the state, cumulatively draining an area as large as \u2013 about half the area of Maharashtra. Within Nashik district, the river assumes a north-easterly course until it flows into the Gangapur Reservoir, created by a dam of the same name. The reservoir along with the Kashypi Dam, provides potable water to Nashik, one of the largest cities located on its banks. The river, as it emerges through the dam, some upstream from Nashik, flows on a rocky bed, undulated by a series of chasms and rocky ledges, resulting in the formation of two significant waterfalls \u2013 the Gangapur and the Someshwar waterfalls. The latter, located at Someshwar, is more popularly known as the Dudhsagar Waterfall. About east of Gangapur, the river passes the town of Nashik, where it collects its effluents in the form of the river Nasardi on its right bank.\nAbout south of Nashik, the river bends sharply to the east, washing the base of a high cliff formerly the site of a Mughal fort, but which is now being eroded away by the action of floods. About below Nashik is the confluence of the Godavari and one of its tributaries, the Darna. The stream occupies, for nine months in the year, a small space in a wide and gravelly bed, the greyish banks being high, topped with a deep layer of black soil. A few kilometres after its meeting with the Darna, the Godavari swerves to the north-east, before the Banganga, from the north-west, meets it on the left. The course of the main stream then tends more decidedly south. At Nandur-Madhmeshwar, the Kadva, a second large affluent, brings considerable increase to the waters of the Godavari. The river begins its southeasterly course characteristic of rivers of the Deccan Plateau. The river exits the Niphad Taluka of Nashik and enters the Kopargaon taluka, Ahmednagar District. Within Ahmednagar District the river quickly completes its short course, flowing alongside the town of Kopargaon and reaching Puntamba. Beyond this, the river serves as a natural boundary between the following districts:\nThe river beyond, near the village Sonpeth, flows into Parbhani. In Parbhani district, the river flows through Gangakhed taluka. As mentioned above, the Godavari is also called Dakshinganga so the city is called as Gangakhed (meaning a village on the bank of Ganga). As per Hindu rituals this place is considered quite important for after death peace to flow ashes into the river.\nIts course is relatively non-significant except for receiving two smaller streams \u2013 Indrayani and Masuli \u2013 merging at its left and right banks, respectively. Within the last taluka of the district Parbhani, Purna, the river drains a major tributary of the same name: Purna.\nIt then exits into the neighbouring district of Nanded where before reaching the town Nanded, it is impounded by the Vishnupuri Dam and thus with it, bringing Asia's largest lift irrigation projects to life. A little downstream from Nanded, the river receives Asna, a small stream, on its left bank. It then runs into the controversial Babli project soon ends its course within Maharashtra, albeit temporarily, at its merger with a major tributary \u2013 Manjira.\nThe river after flowing into Telangana, re-emerges to run as a state boundary separating the Mancherial, Telangana from Gadchiroli, Maharashtra. At the state border, it runs between Sironcha and Somnoor Sangam receiving one tributary at each of those nodal points \u2013 the Pranhita and subsequently the Indravati.\nWithin Telangana.\nGodavari enters into Telangana in Nizamabad district at Kandakurthy where Manjira, Haridra rivers joins Godavari and forms Triveni Sangamam. The river flows along the border between Nirmal and Mancherial districts in the north and Nizamabad, Jagtial, Peddapalli districts to its south. About after entering Telangana it merges with the back waters of the Sriram Sagar Dam. The river after emerging through the dam gates, enjoys a wide river bed, often splitting to encase sandy islands. The river receives a minor but significant tributary Kadam river. It then emerges at its eastern side to act as a state border with Maharashtra only to later enter into Bhadradri Kothagudem district. In this district, the river flows through an important Hindu pilgrimage town \u2013 Bhadrachalam.\nThe river further swells after receiving a minor tributary Kinnerasani River and exits into Andhra Pradesh.\nWithin Andhra Pradesh.\nWithin the state of Andhra Pradesh, the river flows through hilly terrain of the Eastern Ghats known as the Papi hills which explains the narrowing of its bed as it flows through a gorge for a few km, only to re-widen at Polavaram. The deepest bed level of a submarine plunge pool in Godavari River, located 36\u00a0km upstream of Polavaram dam, is at 45 meters below the sea level. Before crossing the Papi hills, it receives its last major tributary Sabari River on its left bank. The river upon reaching the plains begins to widen out until it reaches Rajamahendravaram. Arma Konda () is the highest peak in the Godavari river basin as well as in the Eastern Ghats.\nDowleswaram Barrage was constructed across the river in Rajamahendravaram. At Rajamahendravaram, the Godavari splits into two large branches which are called Gautami (Gautami Godavari) and Vasishta Godavari and five smaller branches. Similarly, the Vasishta splits into two branches named Vasishta and Vainateya. These four branches which join the Bay of Bengal at different places, form a delta of length along the coast of the Bay of Bengal and is called the Konaseema region. This delta along with the delta of the Krishna River is called the \"Rice Granary\" of South India.\nWithin Puducherry.\nThe Gautami which is the largest branch of the whole passes along Yanam enclave of Union territory of Puducherry and empties into sea at \"Point Godavery\". In fact, Yanam is bounded on south by Gautami branch and the Coringa River originates at Yanam which merges into the sea near Coringa village in Andhra Pradesh.\nDischarge.\nMean annual, minimum and maximum discharge (Q \u2013 m3/s) at Rajahmundry (period from 1998/01/01 to 2023/12/31):\nTributaries.\nThe major left bank tributaries include the Purna, Pranhita, Indravati, and Sabari River, covering nearly 59.7% of the total catchment area of the basin. The right bank tributaries Pravara, Manjira, and Manair contribute 16.1% of the basin.\nThe Pranhita River is the largest tributary of the Godavari River, covering about 34% of its drainage basin. Though the river proper flows only for , by virtue of its extensive tributaries Wardha, Wainganga, Penganga, the sub-basin drains all of Vidharba region as well as the southern slopes of the Satpura Ranges. Indravati is the 2nd largest tributary, known as the \"lifeline\" of the Kalahandi, Nabarangapur of Odisha and Bastar district of Chhattisgarh. Due to their enormous sub-basins both Indravati and Pranhita are considered rivers in their own right. Manjira is the longest tributary and holds the Nizam Sagar reservoir. Purna is a prime river in the water scarce Marathwada region of Maharashtra.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther than these seven principal tributaries, it has many smaller but significant ones draining into it. Indravati river floodwaters overflow into the Jouranala which is part of Sabari basin. A barrage at is constructed across the Indravati river to divert Indravati water in to Sabari river for enhanced hydropower generation.\nSeven mouths of Godavari.\nBefore merging into the Bay of Bengal, the Godavari has seven mouths in total and is considered sacred by local Hindus. As per their traditional belief, the holy waters of the Godavari are said to have been brought from the head of Shiva by the \"Rishi Gautama\", and the seven branches by which it is traditionally supposed to have reached the sea are said have been made by seven great rishis known as Sapta Rishis. Thus, they are named after these seven great rishis and are named as Tulyabh\u0101ga (Tulya or Ka\u015byapa), \u0100treya (Atri), Gautam\u012b (Gautama), Jamadagni (now replaced by V\u1e5bddhagautam\u012b i.e. Old Gautami), Bhardv\u0101ja (Bharadvaja), Kau\u015bika (Visvamitra) and Va\u015bi\u0219\u021bha (Vasishtha). So bathing in these mouths are considered an act of great religious efficacy by native Hindus. These mouths are remembered by a Sanskrit sloka as follow:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"\"(Godavari becomes) Tulya, \u0100treyi, Bharadv\u0101ja, Gautam\u012b, V\u1e5bddhagautam\u012b,Kau\u015bik\u012b and Va\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6dhaa and then passes into sea.\nTogether they are referred as \"Sapta Godavari\" and the Godavari river before splitting is referred as \"Akhanda Godavari\". However, there exists another eight mouth named as Vainateyam, which is not one of these traditional seven mouths and is supposed to have been created by a rishi of that name who stole a part of Vasisththa branch. Godavari was frequently referred as Ganga or Ganges by ancient Indian writings. However, the original branches of \"Kau\u015bika\", \"Bhardwaja\" and \"Jamadagni\" does not exist any longer and the pilgrims bathe in the sea at the spots where they are supposed to have been. The traditional Bharadw\u0101ja mouth is in \"Tirth\u0101lamondi\" (now bordering Savithri Nagar of Yanam and before a Hamlet of Guttenadivi) and the traditional Kau\u015bika mouth is located at Rameswaram, a hamlet of Samathakurru village in Allavaram Mandal of Konaseema district. Traditional mouth of Jamadagni is not known and people instead take bath in the Vriddha Gautami branch at Kundaleswaram village in Katrenikona Mandal of Konaseema district. There is a local legend saying the \"Injaram\" and \"Patha (Old) Injaram\" (now on the other bank of Gautami river within Island Polavalam mandal of Konaseema district) were split by Godavari river. Thus the Godavari passing between these two now referred as Gautami and the old passage being referred as Vriddha Gautami. In early British records, the Injaram \"Paragana\" (district) was counted along with Muramalla village (now located on the other side of Gautami within Island Polavalam mandal) and said to have comprised 22 villages.\nReligious significance.\nThe river is sacred to Hindus and has several places on its banks that have been places of pilgrimage for thousands of years. Amongst the huge numbers of people who have bathed in her waters as a rite of cleansing are said to have been the deity Baladeva 5000 years ago and the saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 500 years ago. Every twelve years, the Pushkaram fair is held on the banks of the river.\nA legend has it that the sage Gautama lived in the Brahmagiri Hills at Tryambakeshwar with his wife Ahalya. The couple lived the rest of their lives in the then village called \"Govuru\", now known as Kovvur (\"cow\") since British rule. Ahalya lived in a nearby place called \"Thagami\" (now Thogummi). The sage, as a reason for the practice of \"annadanam\" (\"giving away food\" to the needy), started cultivating rice crops and other crops. Once, the god Ganesha, on the wish of the sages, sent a miraculous cow \"mayadhenu\", which resembled a normal cow. It entered the sage's abode and started spoiling the rice while he was meditating. Since cattle is sacred to Hindus and treated with respect, he put the \"darbha\" grass on the cow. But, to his surprise, it fell dead. Seeing what happened before their eyes, the sages and their wives cried out, \"We thought that Gautama-maharishi is a righteous man, but he committed bovicide (killing of a cow or cattle)!\". The sage wished to atone for this grievous sin. Therefore, he went to Nashik and observed tapas (penance) to propitiate Tryambakeshvara (a manifestation of the god Shiva), on the advice of the sages, praying for atonement and asking him to make the Ganges flow over the cow. Shiva was pleased with the sage and diverted the Ganges, which washed away the cow and gave rise to the Godavari River in Nashik. The water stream flowed past Kovvur and ultimately merged with the Bay of Bengal.\nSapta S\u0101gara Yatra.\nIn olden days a pilgrimage named as \"sapta s\u0101gara y\u0101tra\" was made by those desirous of offspring along the banks of the holy waters from the seven mouths. It starts with holy bathing at Tulyabhaga river at Chollangi village on Amavasya during Krishna Paksha of Pushya month as per Hindu calendar. That day is locally referred as \"Chollangi Amavasya\". That place where the river branch merges with sea is referred as \"Tulya S\u0101gara Sangamam\". Secondly, they take bath in Coringa village in the Coringa river which is considered as Atreya branch of Godavari and the holy bathing place is called as \"Atreya S\u0101gara Sangamam\". After bathing at different banks of the other branches the pilgrimage ends by bathing near Narsapuram or Antarvedi.\nSettlements along the Godavari.\nPlaces of interest.\nSites of pilgrimage include:\nFlora and fauna.\nThe following are few other wildlife sanctuaries located in the river basin:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWaterfalls.\nDuduma Waterfalls is high and one of the highest waterfalls in southern India. It is located on the Sileru River which forms boundary between Andhra Pradesh and Odisha states. The following are a few other waterfalls located in the river basin:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCrossings.\nThere are 4 bridges spanning the river between East Godavari and West Godavari districts.\nDetails:\nDams.\nThe main Godavari River up to the confluence with Pranhita tributary is dammed fully to utilize the available water for irrigation. However, its main tributaries Pranhita, Indravati and Sabari which join in the lower reaches of the basin, carry three times more water compared to main Godavari. In 2015, the water surplus Godavari River is linked to the water deficit Krishna River by commissioning the Polavaram right bank canal with the help of Pattiseema lift scheme to augment water availability to the Prakasam Barrage located in Andhra Pradesh. More dams are constructed in the Godavari River basin than in any other river basin of India. The following are the few dams located in the river basin:\nHydro power stations.\nThe Godavari River in Maharashtra is one of the rivers whose water energy is least harnessed for generating hydro electricity. The 600 MW capacity Upper Indravati hydro power station is the biggest hydro power station which diverts Godavari River water to the Mahanadi River basin. The following is the list of hydro electric power stations excluding small and medium installations.\nUnutilized water.\nNearly 2490 tmcft of water has gone waste to the sea on average in a water year from 1 June 2003 to 31 May 2022 (19 years). The yearly water unutilized is given below\nThere is least possibility to construct new reservoirs in the river basin area due to land submergence and displacement of population. However, a freshwater coastal reservoir, located on the adjacent sea, with adequate storage capacity (nearly 29 billion m3) is economically feasible to harness the remaining unutilized water in the river.\nGeology and sediment transfer in the Godavari Drainage Basin.\nThe primary and initial catchment of the Godavari drainage basin is largely represented by the basalt of the Deccan Volcanic Province (~50% of the total basin area). This is followed by the Precambrian granites and gneisses of the eastern Dharwar Craton, sandstones, shales and limestones of the Gondwana Supergroup, various sedimentary units of Cuddapah and Vindhyan basins, charnockites and khondalites of the Proterozoic Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt and the sandstones of the Rajahmundry Formation. The Godavari River carries the largest sediment load among the peninsular rivers and the majority of the mass transfer in Godavari occurs during the monsoon. Mineral magnetic studies of the Godavari River sediments suggest that the floodplains in the entire stretch of the river are characterized by a Deccan basalt source. The bed loads on the other hand are of sourced from local bedrock. Influx of Deccan source in the Godavari River up to the delta regions and possibly in the Bay of Bengal off the Godavari, therefore, can be related to the intensive chemical weathering in the Deccan basalts. Abrupt increase in \u03b413C values and decrease in TOC content accompanied with a significant increase in ferrimagnetic mineral concentration in Bay of Bengal sediments from ~3.2 to 3.1 cal. ka BP reflected a shift of organic carbon and sediment source and a severe decline in vegetation coverage. Such phenomena indicate intensified deforestation and soil/rock erosion in the Deccan Plateau producing higher ferrimagnetic mineral inputs, which is in agreement with significant expansion of agricultural activities in the Deccan Chalcolithic cultural period.\nMineral deposits.\nThe Godavari River basin is endowed with rich mineral deposits such as oil and gas, coal, iron, limestone, manganese, copper, bauxite, granite, laterite, and others. The following are the few noted deposits:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEcological concerns.\nThe frequent drying up of the Godavari River in the drier months has been a matter of great concern. Indiscriminate damming along the river has been cited as an obvious reason. Within Maharashtra sugarcane irrigation has been blamed as one of the foremost causes.\nIn 2013, the river was at its all-time low in the Nizamabad district of Telangana. This had hit the growth of fish, making the life of fishermen miserable. The water-level was so low that people could easily walk into the middle of the river. Shortage in rainfall and closure of the controversial Babli project gates in Maharashtra was thought to have affected the water flow in the river and water availability to the Sriram Sagar Project except during above 20% excess monsoon (i.e. one out of four years) years.\nA study has found that the delta is at a greater risk as the rate of sediment aggradation (raising the level of the delta through sediment deposition) no longer exceeds relative sea level rise. It further states that the suspended sediment load at the delta has reduced from 150\u00b72 million tons during 1970\u20131979 to 57\u00b72 million tons by 2000\u20132006, which translates into a three-fold decline in the past 4 decades. Impacts of this can be seen in destroyed villages like Uppada in Godavari delta, destruction of Mangrove forests and fragmentation of shoreline \u2013 possibly a fallout of dam construction.\nSaid to further epitomise the insensitivity towards Godavari, is the Polavaram Project which is touted to be gigantic \u2013 both in terms of size and violations. Deemed as being pointless and politically driven, the project raises questions about environmental clearance, displacement of upstream human habitations, loss of forest cover, technicalities in the dam design which are said to play down flood threats and unsafe embankments.\nHigh alkalinity water is discharged from the ash dump areas of many coal fired power stations into the river which further increases the alkalinity of the river water whose water is naturally of high alkalinity since the river basin is draining vast area of basalt formations. This problem aggravates during the lean flow months in entire river basin. Already the Godavari basin area in Telangana is suffering from high alkalinity and salinity water problem which is converting soils in to unproductive sodic alkali soils. The following are the few coal fired power stations located in the river basin:\nIn popular culture.\nOne of the ships of the Indian Navy has been named INS \"Godavari\" after the river. \"Godavari\" is also the codename of some variants of AMD APU chips.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Legislating for an urban growth boundary is one way, among many others, of managing the major challenges posed by unplanned urban growth and the encroachment of cities upon agricultural and rural land.\nAn urban growth boundary circumscribes an entire urbanized area and is used by local governments as a guide to zoning and land use decisions, and by utilities and other infrastructure providers to improve efficiency through effective long term planning (e.g. optimising sewerage catchments, school districts, etc.).\nIf the area affected by the boundary includes multiple jurisdictions a special urban planning agency may be created by the state or regional government to manage the boundary. In a rural context, the terms town boundary, village curtilage or village envelope may be used to apply the same constraining principles. Some jurisdictions refer to the area within an urban growth boundary as an urban growth area (UGA) or urban service area, etc. While the names are different, the concept is the same.\nHistory.\nOpposition to unregulated urban growth and ribbon development began to grow towards the end of the 19th century in England. The campaign group Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) was formed in 1926 and exerted environmentalist pressure. Implementation of the notion dated from Herbert Morrison's 1934 leadership of the London County Council. It was first formally proposed by the Greater London Regional Planning Committee in 1935, \"to provide a reserve supply of public open spaces and of recreational areas and to establish a green belt or girdle of open space\".\nNew provisions for compensation in the \"1947 Town and Country Planning Act\" allowed local authorities around the country to incorporate green belt proposals in their first development plans. The codification of Green Belt policy and its extension to areas other than London came with the historic Circular 42/55 inviting local planning authorities to consider the establishment of Green Belts.\nIn the United States, the first urban growth boundary was established in 1958, around the city of Lexington, Kentucky. Lexington's population was expanding, and city leaders were concerned about the survival of the surrounding horse farms closely tied to the city's cultural identity. The first statewide urban growth boundary policy was implemented in Oregon, under then governor Tom McCall, as part of the state's land-use planning program in the early 1970s. Tom McCall and his allies convinced the Oregon Legislature in 1973 to adopt the nation's first set of statewide land use planning laws. McCall, with the help of a unique coalition of farmers and environmentalists, persuaded the Legislature that the state's natural beauty and easy access to nature would be lost in a rising tide of urban sprawl. The new goals and guidelines required every city and county in Oregon to have a long-range plan addressing future growth that meets both local and statewide goals. The state of Tennessee passed the Tennessee Growth Policy Act\n(TGPA) in 1998 as a response to the state's growing population, increased land development, and conflicts regarding municipal annexation. Tennessee in the year prior to the TGPA's passing was ranked 4th in the United States for fastest rates of land development.\nPlaces with urban growth boundaries.\nAlbania.\nAlbania maintains the 'yellow line' system hailing from its socialist regime \u2014 limiting urban development beyond a designated boundary for all municipalities.\nAustralia.\nAfter the release of Melbourne 2030 in October 2002, the state government of Victoria legislated an urban growth boundary to limit urban sprawl. Since then, the urban growth boundary has been significantly increased a number of times.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa (the \"Greenbelt\"), London, and Waterloo, Ontario have boundaries to restrict growth and preserve greenspace. In Montreal and in the rest of Quebec, an agricultural protection law serves a similar purpose by restricting urban development to white zones and forbidding it on green zones.\nSuch boundaries are notably absent from cities such as Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg that lie on flat plains and have expanded outwardly on former agricultural land. In British Columbia, the Agricultural Land Reserve serves a similar purpose adjacent to urban areas.\nChina.\nIn 2017, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping delivered a speech in the 19th National Congress, in which he mentioned the delineation of \"boundaries for urban development\" (). On November 11, 2019, the Party General Office and the General Office of the State Council issued a guiding opinion, requiring \"three control lines\", including boundaries of urban development, to be designated in territorial spatial planning.\nHong Kong.\nIn the plan of some new towns, green belts are included and growth cannot sprawl into or across the green belts. In addition a majority of new towns are surrounded by country parks.\nFrance.\nIn France, Rennes decided in the 1960s to maintain a green belt after its ring road. This green belt is named \"Ceinture verte\".\nNew Zealand.\nOver the past two decades, Greater Auckland has been subject to a process of growth management facilitated through various strategic and legislative documents. An overarching objective has been to manage the growth of Auckland in a higherdensity, centres-based manner consistent with the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy. Effect is given to that strategy through a series of layers of control including the \"Local Government Amendment (Auckland) Act\", the \"Regional Policy Statement\" and then via District Plans. A key outcome of the process was the establishment of a metropolitan urban limit (MUL) or urban fence, which dictated the nature and extent of urban activities that could occur within the MUL and hence also dictated the relative values of land within the MUL.\nRomania.\nContainment of built-up development is defined through a General Zoning Plan in the case of both urban and rural municipalities. The plan defines the 'intravilan' as the boundary within which built-up development is allowed. Oradea municipality provides tools to verify if land parcels are located in intravilan or not.\nSouth Africa.\nAn integrated development plan is required in terms of Chapter 5 of the national \"Municipal Systems Act\" No 32 of 2000 for all local authorities in South Africa. This plan would include a spatial development framework plan as one of its components, which would require larger metropolitan areas to indicate an urban edge beyond which urban-type development would be largely restricted or forbidden. The concept was introduced in the 1970s by the Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission of the Province of Natal (now known as KwaZulu-Natal) in the regional guide plans for Durban and Pietermaritzburg. The concept was at that stage termed an \"urban fence\".\nUnited Kingdom.\nControls to constrain the area of urban development existed in London as early as the 16th century. In the middle of the 20th century the countryside abutting the London conurbation was protected by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Further green belts were then created around other urban areas in the United Kingdom.\nUnited States.\nThe U.S. states of Oregon, Washington and Tennessee require cities and counties to establish urban/county growth boundaries.\nOregon restricts the development of farm and forest land. Oregon's law provides that the growth boundary be adjusted regularly to ensure adequate supply of developable land; as of 2018 the boundary had been expanded more than thirty times since it was created in 1980. In the Metro area, the urban growth boundary has to have enough land within it for 20 years of growth; it is reviewed every six years. Other cities in Oregon seek regulatory review of proposed urban growth boundary expansions as needed. Some economic analysis has concluded that farmland lying immediately outside of Portland's growth boundary is worth as little as one-tenth as much as similar land located immediately on the other side; other analysis have found that the UGB has no effect on prices when some other variables are taken into account.\nWashington's Growth Management Act, modeled on Oregon's earlier law and approved in 1990, affected mostly the state's more urban counties: as of 2018, Clark County, King County, Kitsap County, Pierce County, Snohomish County, and Thurston County.\nIn Tennessee, the boundaries are not used to control growth per se, but rather to define long-term city boundaries. (This was a response to a short-lived law in the late 1990s allowing almost any group of people in the state to form their own city). Every county in the state (except those with consolidated city-county governments) has to set a \"planned growth area\" for each of its municipalities, which defines how far out services such as water and sewer will go. In the Memphis area, annexation reserves have been created for all municipalities in the county. These are areas that have been set aside for a particular municipality to annex in the future. Cities cannot annex land outside of these reserves, so in effect the urban growth boundaries are along the borders of these annexation reserves. Additionally, new cities are only allowed to incorporate in areas determined to be planned for urban growth.\nCalifornia requires each county to have a Local Agency Formation Commission, which sets urban growth boundaries for each city and town in the county.\nStates such as Texas use the delineation of extraterritorial jurisdictional boundaries to map out future city growth with the idea of minimizing competitive annexations rather than controlling growth.\nNotable U.S. cities surrounded by UGBs include Portland, Oregon; Boulder, Colorado; Honolulu, Hawaii; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Lexington, Kentucky; Seattle, Washington; Knoxville, Tennessee; and San Jose, California. Urban growth boundaries also exist in Miami-Dade County, Florida and the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota. In Miami-Dade, it is referred to as the Urban Development Boundary (UDB), and is generally to protect from continued sprawl into and drainage of the Everglades. Portland, Oregon is required to have an urban growth boundary which contains at least of vacant land.\nUrban growth boundaries have come under an increasing amount of scrutiny in the past 10 years as housing prices have substantially risen, especially on the West Coast of the U.S. By limiting the supply of developable land, critics argue, UGBs increase the price of existing developable and already-developed land. As a result, they theorize, housing on that land becomes more expensive. In Portland, Oregon, for example, the housing boom of the previous four years drove the growth-management authority to substantially increase the UGB in 2004. While some point to affordability for this action, in reality it was in response to Oregon State law. By law, Metro, the regional government, is required to maintain a 20-year supply of land within the boundary. Even with the addition of several thousand acres (several km2) housing prices continued to rise at record-matching paces. Supporters of UGBs point out that Portland's housing market is still more affordable than other West Coast cities, and housing prices have increased across the country.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48029", "revid": "6404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48029", "title": "Valerie Solanas", "text": "American radical feminist (1936\u20131988)\nValerie Jean Solanas (April 9, 1936 \u2013 April 25, 1988) was an American radical feminist known for her attempt to murder the artist Andy Warhol in 1968. \nSolanas appeared in the Warhol film \"I, a Man\" (1967) and self-published the \"SCUM Manifesto\", a misandrist pamphlet calling for the extinction of men. She believed Warhol was conspiring with her publisher, Maurice Girodias, to keep her manuscript from getting published. On June 3, 1968, Solanas shot Warhol and art critic Mario Amaya at the Factory. She was charged with attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a firearm. Solanas was subsequently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and sentenced to three years in prison. After her release, she was arrested again for aggravated assault in 1971 after threatening editors Barney Rosset and Fred Jordan of Grove Press. She was subsequently institutionalized several times. Solanas continued to promote the \"SCUM Manifesto\" and was an editor for the biweekly feminist magazine \"Majority Report\" and then drifted into obscurity. She became destitute and died of pneumonia in 1988.\nEarly life.\nValerie Solanas was born in 1936 in Ventnor City, New Jersey, to Louis Solanas and Dorothy Marie Biondo. Her father was a bartender and her mother a dental assistant. She had a younger sister, Judith Arlene Solanas Martinez. Her father was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to parents who immigrated from Spain. Her mother was an Italian-American of Genoan and Sicilian descent born in Philadelphia.\nSolanas alleged that her father regularly sexually abused her. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a girl in high school who was bothering a younger boy, and also hit a nun.\nBecause of her rebellious behavior, Solanas' mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas reported that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was aged 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, Solanas gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor. The child, named David, was taken away and she never saw him again.\nAfter high school, Solanas earned a degree in psychology from the University of Maryland, College Park, where she was in the Psi Chi Honor Society. While at the University of Maryland, she hosted a call-in radio show where she gave advice on how to combat men. Solanas was an open lesbian, despite the conservative cultural climate of the 1950s.\nSolanas attended the University of Minnesota's Graduate School of Psychology, where she worked in the animal research laboratory, before dropping out and moving to attend Berkeley for a few courses. It was during this time that she began writing the \"SCUM Manifesto\".\nNew York City and the Factory.\nIn the mid-1960s, Solanas moved to New York City and supported herself through begging and prostitution. In 1965, she wrote two works: an autobiographical short story, \"A Young Girl's Primer on How to Attain the Leisure Class\", and a play, \"Up Your Ass\", about a young prostitute. According to James Martin Harding, the play is \"based on a plot about a woman who 'is a man-hating hustler and panhandler' and who\u00a0... ends up killing a man.\" Harding describes it as more a \"provocation than\u00a0... a work of dramatic literature\" and \"rather adolescent and contrived\". The short story was published in \"Cavalier\" magazine in July 1966. \"Up Your Ass\" remained unpublished until 2014.\nIn 1967, Solanas called pop artist Andy Warhol at his studio, the Factory, and asked him to produce \"Up Your Ass\". According to Warhol, he thought the title was \"wonderful\" and he invited her to come over with it. He accepted the script for review, told Solanas it was \"well typed\", and promised to read it. However, when he read the script he thought it was so pornographic that it must have been a police trap. Solanas later contacted Warhol about the script and when she was told that he had lost it, she started demanding money. She was staying at the Chelsea Hotel and told Warhol that she needed money for rent so he offered to pay her $25 to appear in his film \"I, a Man\" (1967).\nIn her role in \"I, a Man\", Solanas leaves the film's title character, played by Tom Baker, to fend for himself, explaining, \"I gotta go beat my meat\" as she exits the scene. She was satisfied with her experience working with Warhol and her performance in the film, and brought Maurice Girodias, the founder of Olympia Press, to see it. Girodias described her as being \"very relaxed and friendly with Warhol\". Solanas also had a nonspeaking role in Warhol's film \"Bike Boy\" (1967).\n\"SCUM Manifesto\".\nIn 1967, Solanas self-published her best-known work, the \"SCUM Manifesto\", a scathing critique of patriarchal culture. The manifesto's opening words are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Life\" in this \"society\" being, at best, an utter bore and no aspect of \"society\" being at all relevant to women, there remains to civic-minded, responsible, thrill-seeking females only to overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex.\nSome authors have argued that the \"Manifesto\" is a parody and satirical work targeting patriarchy. According to Harding, Solanas described herself as \"a social propagandist\", but she denied that the work was \"a put on\" and insisted that her intent was \"dead serious\". The \"Manifesto\" has been translated into over a dozen languages and is excerpted in several feminist anthologies.\nWhile living at the Chelsea Hotel, Solanas introduced herself to Girodias, a fellow resident of the hotel. In August 1967, Girodias and Solanas signed an informal contract stating that she would give Girodias her \"next writing, and other writings\". In exchange, Girodias paid her $500. Solanas took this to mean that Girodias would own her work. She told Paul Morrissey that \"everything I write will be his. He's done this to me\u00a0... He's screwed me!\" Solanas intended to write a novel based on the \"SCUM Manifesto\" and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol's failure to return the \"Up Your Ass\" script. She suspected that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work.\nShooting.\nOn June 3, 1968, Valerie Solanas arrived at the Hotel Chelsea and asked for Girodias, who was unavailable. She stayed there for three hours before heading to the Grove Press, where she asked for Barney Rosset, who was also not available. In her 2014 biography of Solanas, Breanne Fahs argues that it is unlikely that she appeared at the Hotel Chelsea looking for Girodias, speculating that Girodias may have fabricated the account to boost sales for the \"SCUM Manifesto\". Instead, Solanas is believed to have been at the Actors Studio in Manhattan early that morning. Actress Sylvia Miles claimed Solanas arrived at the Actors Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave a copy of \"Up Your Ass\". Miles informed Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon, accepted the script, and then shut the door because she \"knew Solanas was trouble\".\nSolanas then visited producer Margo Feiden (then Margo Eden) in Brooklyn to convince her to produce \"Up Your Ass\". Feiden repeatedly refused to produce the play, so Solanas pulled out her gun and she promised to shoot Andy Warhol to make her and the play famous. As she left Feiden's residence, she handed her a partial copy of an earlier draft of the play and other personal papers. Feiden reported the incident to her local police precinct, but they responded with reluctance, stating that arresting someone because they believed she was going to kill Warhol was impossible. \nSolanas went to the Factory and waited outside for Andy to get money. Morrissey arrived and tried to get rid of her by telling her Warhol wouldn't be in that day. She left but later entered the building with Warhol and Factory assistant Jed Johnson. While Warhol was on the phone, Solanas fired at him three times. Her first two shots missed, but the third went through his spleen, stomach, liver, esophagus, and lungs. She then also shot art critic Mario Amaya. Warhol was taken to Columbus\u2013Mother Cabrini Hospital in critical condition, where he underwent a successful five-hour operation.\nLater that day, Solanas turned herself in to police, gave up her gun, and confessed to the shooting, telling an officer that Warhol \"had too much control in my life\". She was fingerprinted and charged with felonious assault and possession of a deadly weapon. The next morning, the New York \"Daily News\" ran the front-page headline: \"Actress Shoots Andy Warhol\". Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement that she was an actress. The \"Daily News\" changed the headline in its later edition and added a quote from Solanas stating, \"I'm a writer, not an actress.\"\nTrial.\nAt her arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court, Solanas denied shooting Warhol because he would not produce her play but said \"it was for the opposite reason\", that \"he has a legal claim on my works\". She declared that she wanted to represent herself and she insisted that she \"was right in what I did! I have nothing to regret!\" The judge struck Solanas' comments from the court record and had her admitted to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric observation.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI consider that a moral act. And I consider it immoral that I missed. I should have done target practice.\n\u2014 Valerie Solanas on shooting Andy Warhol\nAfter a cursory evaluation, Solanas was declared mentally unstable and transferred to the prison ward of Elmhurst Hospital. She appeared at New York Supreme Court on June 13, 1968. Florynce Kennedy represented her and asked for a writ of , arguing that Solanas was being held inappropriately at Elmhurst. The judge denied the motion and Solanas returned to Elmhurst. On June 28, Solanas was indicted on charges of attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a firearm. She was declared \"incompetent\" in August and sent to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. That same month, Olympia Press published the \"SCUM Manifesto\" with essays by Girodias and Krassner.\nIn January 1969, Solanas underwent a psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia. In June, she was deemed fit to stand trial. She represented herself without an attorney and pleaded guilty to \"reckless assault with intent to harm\". Solanas was sentenced to three years in prison, with one year of time served.\nImprisonment.\nSolanas spent a few weeks at the State Prison for Women at Bedford Hills in May 1970, before being sent back to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. After escaping from Matteawan in April 1971 and eluding the police for two months, she was apprehended and returned to Matteawan on June 16, 1971. Solanas completed her prison sentence at the end of that month, at which point she was released.\nMedia response.\nThe shooting of Warhol propelled Solanas into the public spotlight, prompting a flurry of commentary and opinions in the media. Robert Marmorstein, writing in \"The Village Voice\", declared that Solanas \"has dedicated the remainder of her life to the avowed purpose of eliminating every single male from the face of the earth\". Norman Mailer called her the \"Robespierre of feminism\". Historian Alice Echols writes that members of New York Radical Women knew \"next to nothing\" about Solanas until her 1968 shooting of Warhol, but that afterward, Solanas\u2019s case became a among radical feminists, and \"SCUM Manifesto\" became \"obligatory reading\".\nTi-Grace Atkinson, the New York chapter president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), described Solanas as \"the first outstanding champion of women's rights\" and \"a 'heroine' of the feminist movement\", and \"smuggled [her manifesto]\u00a0... out of the mental hospital where Solanas was confined\". According to Betty Friedan, the NOW board rejected Atkinson's statement. Atkinson left NOW and founded another feminist organization. According to Friedan, \"the media continued to treat Ti-Grace as a leader of the women's movement, despite its repudiation of her\". Kennedy, another NOW member, called Solanas \"one of the most important spokeswomen of the feminist movement.\"\nEnglish professor Dana Heller argued that Solanas was \"very much aware of feminist organizations and activism\", but \"had no interest in participating in what she often described as 'a civil disobedience luncheon club.'\" Heller also stated that Solanas could \"reject mainstream liberal feminism for its blind adherence to cultural codes of feminine politeness and decorum which the \"SCUM Manifesto\" identifies as the source of women's debased social status\".\nLater life and death.\nAfter Solanas was released from Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in June 1971, she stalked Warhol and others over the telephone. She harassed publisher Maurice Girodias of Olympia Press, demanding $50,000 in payments. In December 1971, Solanas was arrested again for aggravated assault after threatening Barney Rosset, owner of Grove Press and founder of the \"Evergreen Review\", and Fred Jordan, vice president of Grove Press. \nSolanas was sent to Elmhurst Hospital to undergo psychological examinations. She was declared mentally ill, and the charges against her were dropped. Although they couldn't agree on whether she was dangerous to others, Elmhurst's psychiatrists suggested that she be admitted to a secure state hospital until she recovered. Solanas entered Dunlap-Manhattan Psychiatric Hospital on Wards Island, New York in January 1972. In January 1973, Solanas sent Rosset a letter threatening to kill him: \"I'm in the hospital now, but I'll be out soon, + when I get out I'll fix you good. I have a license to kill, you know, + you're one of my candidates. Valerie Solanas.\"\nIn February 1973, Solanas escaped from Dunlap-Manhattan Psychiatric Hospital. When Rosset heard this, he hired a private detective from the Pinkertons Detective Agency to find out where she was. The detectives discovered that she had been living at 302 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. They talked to the hotel manager, three people who lived there, and workers at a dry cleaner, but they found no leads. A few weeks later, Solanas called Jordan to rant about the Mob and demanded to be on the cover of the \"Daily News\". She then made an appointment with him to discuss a potential job at Grove Press. Jordan informed the police, and as she went to the Grove Press offices, she was arrested. A court date was set for March 22, 1973. She was sent back to Dunlap and while in custody, her paranoia about the Mob worsened. Rosset and Jordan's lawyers made arrangements with the hospital to keep her there for several more months, allowing her to leave only after she agreed not to harass the two men.\nIn the mid-1970s, according to Heller, Solanas was \"apparently homeless\" in New York City, \"continued to defend her political beliefs and the \"SCUM Manifesto\"\", and \"actively promoted\" her new \"Manifesto\" revision.\nSolanas may have intended to write an eponymous autobiography. In a 1977 \"Village Voice\" interview, she announced a book with her name as the title. The book, possibly intended as a parody, was supposed to deal with the \"conspiracy\" that led to her imprisonment. In a corrective 1977 \"Village Voice\" interview, Solanas said the book would not be autobiographical other than a small portion and that it would be about many things, include proof of statements in the manifesto, and would \"deal very intensively with the subject of bullshit\", but she said nothing about parody.\nSolanas worked for a year and a half as an editor for \"Majority Report\", a biweekly feminist publication.\nIn the late 1980s, Ultra Violet tracked down Solanas in northern California and interviewed her over the phone. According to Ultra Violet, Solanas had changed her name to Onz Loh and stated that the August 1968 version of the \"Manifesto\" had many errors, unlike her own printed version of October 1967, and that the book had not sold well. Solanas said that until she was informed by Violet, she was unaware of Warhol's death in 1987.\nOn April 25, 1988, at the age of 52, Solanas died of pneumonia at the Bristol Hotel in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. A building superintendent at the hotel, not on duty that night, had a vague memory of Solanas: \"Once, he had to enter her room, and he saw her typing at her desk. There was a pile of typewritten pages beside her. What she was writing and what happened to the manuscript remain a mystery.\" Her mother burned all her belongings posthumously.\nLegacy.\nPopular culture.\nComposer Pauline Oliveros released \"To Valerie Solanas and Marilyn Monroe in Recognition of Their Desperation\" in 1970. In the work, Oliveros seeks to explore how, \"Both women seemed to be desperate and caught in the traps of inequality: Monroe needed to be recognized for her talent as an actress. Solanas wished to be supported for her own creative work.\"\nActress Lili Taylor played Solanas in the film \"I Shot Andy Warhol\" (1996), which focused on Solanas's assassination attempt on Warhol (played by Jared Harris). Taylor won Special Recognition for Outstanding Performance at the Sundance Film Festival for her role. The film's director, Mary Harron, requested permission to use songs by The Velvet Underground but was denied by Lou Reed, who feared that Solanas would be glorified in the film. Six years before the film's release, Reed and John Cale included a song about Solanas, \"I Believe\", on their concept album about Warhol, \"Songs for Drella\" (1990). In \"I Believe\", Reed sings, \"I believe life's serious enough for retribution\u00a0... I believe being sick is no excuse. And I believe I would've pulled the switch on her myself.\" Reed believed Solanas was to blame for Warhol's death from a gallbladder infection twenty years after she shot him.\n\"Up Your Ass\" was rediscovered in 1999 and produced in 2000 by George Coates Performance Works in San Francisco. The copy Warhol had lost was found in a trunk of lighting equipment owned by Billy Name. Coates learned about the rediscovered manuscript while at an exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum marking the 30th anniversary of the shooting. Coates turned the piece into a musical with an all-female cast. Coates consulted with Solanas' sister, Judith, while writing the piece, and sought to create a \"very funny satirist\" out of Solanas, not just showing her as Warhol's attempted assassin.\nSolanas' life has inspired three plays. \"Valerie Shoots Andy\" (2001), by Carson Kreitzer, starred two actors playing a younger (Heather Grayson) and an older (Lynne McCollough) Solanas. \"Tragedy in Nine Lives\" (2003), by Karen Houppert, examined the encounter between Solanas and Warhol as a Greek tragedy and starred Juliana Francis as Solanas. In 2011, \"Pop!\", a musical by Maggie-Kate Coleman and Anna K. Jacobs, focused mainly on Warhol (played by Tom Story). Rachel Zampelli played Solanas and sang \"Big Gun\", described as the \"evening's strongest number\" by \"The Washington Post\".\nSwedish author Sara Stridsberg wrote a semi-fictional novel about Solanas called ('The Dream Faculty'), published in 2006. The book's narrator visits Solanas toward the end of her life at the Bristol Hotel. Stridsberg was awarded the Nordic Council's Literature Prize for the book. The novel was later translated into and published in English under the title \"Valerie, or, The Faculty of Dreams: A Novel\" in 2019.\nIn 2006 Solanas was featured in eleventh episode of the second season Adult Swim show The Venture Bros as part of a group called The Groovy Gang. The group was a parody of the Scooby Gang from Scooby-Doo and was made up of parodies of Solanas (Velma), Ted Bundy (Fred), David Berkowitz (Shaggy), Patty Hearst (Daphne), and Groovy (Scooby). In the episode she is voiced by Joanna Adler. Most of her lines in the episode are quotes from the SCUM Manifesto.\nSolanas was featured in a 2017 episode of the FX series \", \". She was played by Lena Dunham. The episode portrayed Solanas as the instigator of most of the Zodiac Killer murders.\nIn 2022, \"Up Your Ass\" was re-published by writer and editor Leah Whitman-Salkin for MIT's Sternberg Press / Montana. This issue included a contribution by the writer Paul B. Preciado.\nInfluence and analysis.\nAuthor James Martin Harding explained that, by declaring herself independent from Warhol, after her arrest she \"aligned herself with the historical avant-garde's rejection of the traditional structures of bourgeois theater\" and that her anti-patriarchal \"militant hostility\u00a0... pushed the avant-garde in radically new directions\". Harding believed that Solanas' assassination attempt on Warhol was its own theatrical performance. At the shooting, she left on a table at the Factory a paper bag containing a gun, her address book, and a sanitary napkin. Harding stated that leaving behind the sanitary napkin was part of the performance, and called \"attention to basic feminine experiences that were publically [\"sic\"] taboo and tacitly elided within avant-garde circles\".\nFeminist philosopher Avital Ronell compared Solanas to an array of people: Lorena Bobbitt, a \"girl Nietzsche\", Medusa, the Unabomber, and Medea. Ronell believed that Solanas was threatened by the hyper-feminine women of the Factory that Warhol liked and felt lonely because of the rejection she felt due to her own butch androgyny. She believed Solanas was ahead of her time, living in a period before feminist and lesbian activists such as the Guerrilla Girls and the Lesbian Avengers.\nSolanas has also been credited with instigating radical feminism. Catherine Lord wrote that \"the feminist movement would not have happened without Valerie Solanas\". Lord believed that the reissuing of the \"SCUM Manifesto\" and the disowning of Solanas by \"women's liberation politicos\" triggered a wave of radical feminist publications. According to Vivian Gornick, many of the women's liberation activists who initially distanced themselves from Solanas changed their minds a year later, developing the first wave of radical feminism. At the same time, perceptions of Warhol were transformed from largely nonpolitical into political martyrdom because the motive for the shooting was political, according to Harding and Victor Bockris. Solanas' idiosyncratic views on gender are a focus of Andrea Long Chu's 2019 book, \"Females\".\nFahs describes Solanas as a contradiction that \"alienates her from the feminist movement\", arguing that Solanas never wanted to be \"in movement\" but nevertheless fractured the feminist movement by provoking NOW members to disagree about her case. Many contradictions are seen in Solanas' lifestyle as a lesbian who sexually serviced men, her claim to be asexual, a rejection of queer culture, and a non-interest in working with others despite a dependency on others. Fahs also brings into question the contradictory stories of Solanas' life. She is described as a victim, a rebel, and a desperate loner, yet her cousin says she worked as a waitress in her late 20s and 30s, not primarily as a prostitute, and friend Geoffrey LaGear said she had a \"groovy childhood\". Solanas also kept in touch with her father throughout her life, despite claiming that he sexually abused her. Fahs believes that Solanas embraced these contradictions as a key part of her identity.\nIn 2018, \"The New York Times\" started a series of delayed obituaries of significant individuals whose importance the paper's obituary writers had not recognized at the time of their deaths. In June 2020, they started a series of obituaries on LGBTQ individuals, and on June 26, they profiled Solanas.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48030", "revid": "49712780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48030", "title": "Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres", "text": "French painter (1780\u20131867)\nJean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres ( ; ; 29 August 1780\u00a0\u2013 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. Ingres was profoundly influenced by past artistic traditions and aspired to become the guardian of academic orthodoxy against the ascendant Romantic style. Although he considered himself a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David, it is his portraits, both painted and drawn, that are recognized as his greatest legacy. His expressive distortions of form and space made him an important precursor of modern art, influencing Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and other modernists.\nBorn into a modest family in Montauban, he travelled to Paris to study in the studio of David. In 1802 he made his Salon debut, and won the for his painting \"The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles\". By the time he departed in 1806 for his residency in Rome, his style\u2014revealing his close study of Italian and Flemish Renaissance masters\u2014was fully developed, and would change little for the rest of his life. While working in Rome and subsequently Florence from 1806 to 1824, he regularly sent paintings to the Paris Salon, where they were faulted by critics who found his style bizarre and archaic. He received few commissions during this period for the history paintings he aspired to paint, but was able to support himself and his wife as a portrait painter and draughtsman.\nHe was finally recognized at the Salon in 1824, when his Raphaelesque painting, \"The Vow of Louis XIII\", was met with acclaim, and Ingres was acknowledged as the leader of the Neoclassical school in France. Although the income from commissions for history paintings allowed him to paint fewer portraits, his \"Portrait of Monsieur Bertin\" marked his next popular success in 1833. The following year, his indignation at the harsh criticism of his ambitious composition \"The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian\" caused him to return to Italy, where he assumed directorship of the French Academy in Rome in 1835. He returned to Paris for good in 1841. In his later years he painted new versions of many of his earlier compositions, a series of designs for stained glass windows, several important portraits of women, and \"The Turkish Bath\", the last of his several Orientalist paintings of the female nude, which he finished at the age of 83.\nEarly years: Montauban and Toulouse.\nIngres was born in Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne, France, the first of seven children (five of whom survived infancy) of Jean-Marie-Joseph Ingres (1755\u20131814) and his wife Anne Moulet (1758\u20131817). His father was a successful jack-of-all-trades in the arts, a painter of miniatures, sculptor, decorative stonemason, and amateur musician; his mother was the nearly illiterate daughter of a master wigmaker. From his father the young Ingres received early encouragement and instruction in drawing and music, and his first known drawing, a study after an antique cast, was made in 1789. Starting in 1786, he attended the local school \u00c9cole des Fr\u00e8res de l'\u00c9ducation Chr\u00e9tienne, but his education was disrupted by the turmoil of the French Revolution, and the closing of the school in 1791 marked the end of his conventional education. The deficiency in his schooling would always remain for him a source of insecurity.\nIn 1791, Joseph Ingres took his son to Toulouse, where the young Jean-Auguste-Dominique was enrolled in the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture, Sculpture et Architecture. There he studied under the sculptor Jean-Pierre Vigan, the landscape painter Jean Briant, and the neoclassical painter Guillaume-Joseph Roques. Roques' veneration of Raphael was a decisive influence on the young artist. Ingres won prizes in several disciplines, such as composition, \"figure and antique\", and life studies. His musical talent was developed under the tutelage of the violinist Lejeune, and from the ages of thirteen to sixteen he played second violin in the Orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse.\nFrom an early age he was determined to be a history painter, which, in the hierarchy of genres established by the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture under Louis XIV, and continued well into the 19th Century, was considered the highest level of painting. He did not want to simply make portraits or illustrations of real life like his father; he wanted to represent the heroes of religion, history and mythology, to idealize them and show them in ways that explained their actions, rivaling the best works of literature and philosophy.\nIn Paris (1797\u20131806).\nIn March 1797, the Academy awarded Ingres first prize in drawing, and in August he traveled to Paris to study in the studio of Jacques-Louis David, France's\u2014and Europe's\u2014leading painter during the revolutionary period, in whose studio he remained for four years. Ingres followed his master's neoclassical example. In 1797 David was working on his enormous masterpiece, \"The Intervention of the Sabine Women\", and was gradually modifying his style away from Roman models of rigorous realism to the ideals of purity, virtue and simplicity in Greek art. \nOne of the other students of David, \u00c9tienne-Jean Del\u00e9cluze, who later became an art critic, described Ingres as a student: He was distinguished not just by the candor of his character and his disposition to work alone ... he was one of the most studious ... he took little part in the all the turbulent follies around him, and he studied with more perseverance than most of his co-disciples ... All of the qualities which characterize today the talent of this artist, the finesse of contour, the true and profound sentiment of the form, and a modeling with extraordinary correctness and firmness, could already be seen in his early studies. While several of his comrades and David himself signaled a tendency toward exaggeration in his studies, everyone was struck by his grand compositions and recognized his talent. He was admitted to the painting department of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in October 1799. In 1800 and 1801, he won the grand prize for figure painting for his paintings of male torsos. \nIn 1800 and 1801, he competed for the Prix de Rome, the highest prize of the Academy, which entitled the winner to four years of residence at the French Academy in Rome. He came in second in his first attempt, but in 1801 he took the top prize with \"The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles\". The figures of the envoys, in the right of the painting, are muscular and solid as statues, in the style taught by David, but the two main figures on the left, Achilles and Patroclus, are mobile, vivid and graceful, like figures in a delicate bas-relief.\nHis residence in Rome was postponed until 1806 due to shortage of state funds. In the meantime he worked in Paris alongside several other students of David in a studio provided by the state, and further developed a style that emphasized purity of contour. He found inspiration in the works of Raphael, in Etruscan vase paintings, and in the outline engravings of the English artist John Flaxman. His drawings of Hermaphrodite and the Nymph Salmacis showed a new stylized ideal of female beauty, which would reappear later in his \"Jupiter et Thetis\" and his famous nudes.\nIn 1802 he made his debut at the Salon with \"Portrait of a Woman\" (the current whereabouts of which is unknown). Between 1804 and 1806 he painted a series of portraits which were striking for their extreme precision, particularly in the richness of their fabrics and tiny details. These included the \"Portrait of Philipbert Rivi\u00e9re\" (1805), \"Portrait of Sabine Rivi\u00e8re\" (1805\u201306), \"Portrait of Madame Aymon\" (also known as \"La Belle Z\u00e9lie\"; 1806), and \"Portrait of Caroline Rivi\u00e8re\" (1805\u201306). The female faces were not at all detailed but were softened, and were notable for their large oval eyes and delicate flesh colours and their rather dreamlike expressions. His portraits typically had simple backgrounds of solid dark or light colour, or of sky. These were the beginning of a series that would make him among the most celebrated portrait artists of the 19th century.\nAs Ingres waited to depart to Rome, his friend Lorenzo Bartolini introduced him to Italian Renaissance paintings, particularly the works of Bronzino and Pontormo, which Napoleon had brought back from his campaign in Italy and placed in the Louvre. Ingres assimilated their clarity and monumentality into his own portrait style. In the Louvre were also masterpieces of Flemish art, including the \"Ghent Altarpiece\" by Jan van Eyck, which the French army had seized during its conquest of Flanders. The precision of Renaissance Flemish art became part of Ingres's style. Ingres's stylistic eclecticism represented a new tendency in art. The Louvre, newly filled with booty seized by Napoleon in his campaigns in Italy and the Low Countries, provided French artists of the early 19th century with an unprecedented opportunity to study, compare, and copy masterworks from antiquity and from the entire history of European painting. As art historian Marjorie Cohn has written: \"At the time, art history as a scholarly enquiry was brand-new. Artists and critics outdid each other in their attempts to identify, interpret, and exploit what they were just beginning to perceive as historical stylistic developments.\" From the beginning of his career, Ingres freely borrowed from earlier art, adopting the historical style appropriate to his subject, and was consequently accused by critics of plundering the past.\nIn 1803 he received a prestigious commission, being one of five artists selected (along with Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Robert Lef\u00e8vre, Charles Meynier, and Marie-Guillemine Benoist) to paint full-length portraits of Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul. These were to be distributed to the prefectural towns of Li\u00e8ge, Antwerp, Dunkerque, Brussels, and Ghent, all of which were newly ceded to France in the 1801 Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville. Napoleon is not known to have granted the artists a sitting, and Ingres's meticulously painted portrait of \"Bonaparte, First Consul\" appears to be modelled on an image of Napoleon painted by Antoine-Jean Gros in 1802.\nIn the summer of 1806, Ingres became engaged to Marie-Anne-Julie Forestier, a painter and musician, before leaving for Rome in September. Although he had hoped to stay in Paris long enough to witness the opening of that year's Salon, in which he was to display several works, he reluctantly left for Italy just days before the opening.\nIngres painted a new portrait of Napoleon for presentation at the Salon of 1806, this one showing Napoleon on the Imperial Throne for his coronation. This painting was entirely different from his earlier portrait of Napoleon as First Consul; it concentrated almost entirely on the lavish imperial costume that Napoleon had chosen to wear, and the symbols of power he held. The scepter of Charles V, the sword of Charlemagne the rich fabrics, furs and capes, crown of gold leaves, golden chains and emblems were all presented in extremely precise detail; the Emperor's face and hands were almost lost in the majestic costume.\nAt the Salon, his paintings\u2014\"Self-Portrait\", portraits of the Rivi\u00e8re family, and \"Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne\"\u2014received a very chilly reception. David delivered a severe judgement, and the critics were hostile. Chaussard (\"Le Pausanias Fran\u00e7ais\", 1806) praised \"the fineness of Ingres's brushwork and the finish\", but condemned Ingres's style as gothic and asked: How, with so much talent, a line so flawless, an attention to detail so thorough, has M. Ingres succeeded in painting a bad picture? The answer is that he wanted to do something singular, something extraordinary\u00a0... M. Ingres's intention is nothing less than to make art regress by four centuries, to carry us back to its infancy, to revive the manner of Jean de Bruges.\nRome and the French Academy (1806\u20131814).\nNewly arrived in Rome, Ingres read with mounting indignation the relentlessly negative press clippings sent to him from Paris by his friends. In letters to his prospective father-in-law, he expressed his outrage at the critics: \"So the Salon is the scene of my disgrace;\u00a0... The scoundrels, they waited until I was away to assassinate my reputation\u00a0... I have never been so unhappy...I knew I had many enemies; I never was agreeable with them and never will be. My greatest wish would be to fly to the Salon and to confound them with my works, which don't in any way resemble theirs; and the more I advance, the less their work will resemble mine.\" He vowed never again to exhibit at the Salon, and his refusal to return to Paris led to the breaking up of his engagement. Julie Forestier, when asked years later why she had never married, responded, \"When one has had the honor of being engaged to M. Ingres, one does not marry.\"\nOn 23 November 1806, he wrote to Jean Forestier, the father of his former fianc\u00e9e, \"Yes, art will need to be reformed, and I intend to be that revolutionary.\" Characteristically, he found a studio on the grounds of the Villa Medici away from the other resident artists, and painted furiously. Many drawings of monuments in Rome from this time are attributed to Ingres, but it appears from more recent scholarship that they were actually the work of his collaborators, particularly his friend the landscape artist Fran\u00e7ois-Marius Granet. As required of every winner of the \"Prix\", he sent works at regular intervals to Paris so his progress could be judged. Traditionally fellows sent paintings of male Greek or Roman heroes, but for his first samples Ingres sent \"Baigneuse \u00e0 mi-corps\" (1807), a painting of the back of a young woman bathing, based on an engraving of an antique vase, and \"La Grande Bagneuse\" (1808), a larger painting of the back of a nude bather, and the first Ingres model to wear a turban, a detail he borrowed from the Fornarina by his favourite painter, Raphael. To satisfy the Academy in Paris, he also dispatched \"Oedipus and the Sphinx\" to show his mastery of the male nude. The verdict of the academicians in Paris was that the figures were not sufficiently idealized. In later years Ingres painted several variants of these compositions; another nude begun in 1807, the \"Venus Anadyomene\", remained in an unfinished state for decades, to be completed forty years later and finally exhibited in 1855.\nDuring his time in Rome he also painted numerous portraits: \"Madame Duvaucey\" (1807), \"Fran\u00e7ois-Marius Granet\" (1807), \"Joseph-Antoine Moltedo\" (1810), \"Madame Panckoucke\" (1811), and \"Charles-Joseph-Laurent Cordier\" (1811). In 1812 he painted one of his few portraits of an older woman, \"Comtesse de Tournon\", mother of the prefect of Rome. In 1810 Ingres's pension at the Villa Medici ended, but he decided to stay in Rome and seek patronage from the French occupation government.\nIn 1811 Ingres completed his final student exercise, the immense \"Jupiter and Thetis\", a scene from the Iliad of Homer: the goddess of the Sea, Thetis, pleads with Zeus to act in favor of her son Achilles. The face of the water nymph Salmacis he had drawn years earlier reappeared as Thetis. Ingres wrote with enthusiasm that he had been planning to paint this subject since 1806, and he intended to \"deploy all of the luxury of art in its beauty\". However, once again, the critics were hostile, finding fault with the exaggerated proportions of the figures and the painting's flat, airless quality.\nAlthough facing uncertain prospects, in 1813 Ingres married a young woman, Madeleine Chapelle, recommended to him by her friends in Rome. After a courtship carried out through correspondence, he proposed without having met her, and she accepted. Their marriage was happy, and Madame Ingres's faith in her husband was unwavering. After a difficult childbirth in 1815 resulted in a stillborn baby, the couple remained childless. Ingres continued to suffer disparaging reviews, as \"Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV's Sword\", \"Raphael and the Fornarina\" (Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University), several portraits, and the \"Interior of the Sistine Chapel\" met with generally hostile critical response at the Paris Salon of 1814.\nRome after the Academy and Florence (1814\u20131824).\nAfter he left the Academy, a few important commissions came to him. The French governor of Rome, General Miollis, a wealthy patron of the arts, asked him to decorate rooms of the Monte Cavallo Palace, a former papal residence, for an expected visit of Napoleon. Ingres painted a large-scale \"Romulus' Victory Over Acron\" (1811) for the salon of the Empress and \"The Dream of Ossian\" (1813), based on a book of poems that Napoleon admired, for the ceiling of the Emperor's bedroom. General Miollis also commissioned Ingres to paint \"Virgil reading The Aeneid before Augustus, Livia and Octavia\" (1812) for his own residence, the villa Aldobrandini. The painting shows the moment when Virgil, reciting his work to the Emperor Augustus, his wife Livia and his sister Octavia, mentions the name of Octavia's dead son, Marcellus, causing Octavia to faint. The interior was precisely depicted, following the archeological finds at Pompeii. As usual, Ingres made several versions of the same scene: a three-figure fragment cut from an abandoned version is in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, and in 1825 he made a chalk drawing in vertical format as a model for a reproductive engraving made by Pradier in 1832. The General Miollis version was repurchased by Ingres in the 1830s, reworked by assistants under Ingres's direction, and never finished; \"The Dream of Ossian\" was likewise repurchased, modified, but left unfinished.\nHe traveled to Naples in the spring of 1814 to paint \"Queen Caroline Murat\". Joachim Murat, the King of Naples, had earlier purchased the Dormeuse de Naples, a sleeping nude (the original is lost, but several drawings exist, and Ingres later revisited the subject in \"L'Odalisque \u00e0 l'esclave\"). Murat also commissioned two historical paintings, \"Raphael et la Fornarina\" and \"Paolo et Francesca\", and what later became one of Ingres's most famous works, \"La Grande Odalisque\", to accompany \"Dormeuse de Naples\". Ingres never received payment, due to the collapse of the Murat regime and execution of Joachim Murat in 1815. With the fall of Napoleon's dynasty, he found himself essentially stranded in Rome without patronage.\nHe continued to produce masterful portraits, in pencil and oils, of almost photographic precision; but with the departure of the French administration, the painting commissions were rare. During this low point of his career, Ingres augmented his income by drawing pencil portraits of the many wealthy tourists, in particular the English, passing through postwar Rome. For an artist who aspired to a reputation as a history painter, this seemed menial work, and to the visitors who knocked on his door asking, \"Is this where the man who draws the little portraits lives?\", he would answer with irritation, \"No, the man who lives here is a painter!\" The portrait drawings he produced in such profusion during this period rank today among his most admired works. He is estimated to have made some five hundred portrait drawings, including portraits of his famous friends. His friends included many musicians including Paganini, and he regularly played the violin with others who shared his enthusiasm for Mozart, Haydn, Gluck, and Beethoven.\nHe also produced a series of small paintings in what was known as the Troubador style, idealized portrayals of events in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In 1815 he painted \"Aretino and Charles V's Ambassador\" as well as \"Aretino and Tintoretto\", an anecdotal painting whose subject, a painter brandishing a pistol at his critic, may have been especially satisfying to the embattled Ingres. Other paintings in the same style included \"Henry IV Playing with His Children\" (1817) and the \"Death of Leonardo.\"\nIn 1816 Ingres produced his only etching, a portrait of the French ambassador to Rome, Monsignor Gabriel Cortois de Pressigny. The only other prints he is known to have executed are two lithographs: \"The Four Magistrates of Besan\u00e7on\", made as an illustration for Baron Taylor's \"Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l'ancienne France\", and a copy of \"La Grande Odalisque\", both in 1825.\nIn 1817 the Count of Blacas, who was ambassador of France to the Holy See, provided Ingres with his first official commission since 1814, for a painting of \"Christ Giving the Keys to Peter\". Completed in 1820, this imposing work was well received in Rome but to the artist's chagrin the ecclesiastical authorities there would not permit it to be sent to Paris for exhibition.\nA commission came in 1816 or 1817 from the descendants of the Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alva, for a painting of the Duke receiving papal honours for his repression of the Protestant Reformation. Ingres loathed the subject\u2014he regarded the Duke as one of history's brutes\u2014and struggled to satisfy both the commission and his conscience. After revisions which eventually reduced the Duke to a tiny figure in the background, Ingres left the work unfinished. He entered in his diary, \"J'etais forc\u00e9 par la necessit\u00e9 de peindre un pareil tableau; Dieu a voulu qu'il reste en ebauche.\" (\"I was forced by need to paint such a painting; God wanted it to remain a sketch.\")\nHe continued to send works to the Salon in Paris, hoping to make his breakthrough there. In 1819 he sent his reclining nude, \"La Grande Odalisque\", as well as a history painting, \"Philip V and the Marshal of Berwick\", and \"Roger Freeing Angelica\", based on an episode in the 16th-century epic poem \"Orlando Furioso\" by Ariosto but his work was once again condemned by critics as gothic and unnatural. The critic K\u00e9raty complained that the Grande Odalisque's back was three vertebrae too long. The critic Charles Landon wrote: \"After a moment of attention, one sees that in this figure there are no bones, no muscles, no blood, no life, no relief, no anything which constitutes imitation...it is evident that the artist deliberately erred, that he wanted to do it badly, that he believed in bringing back to life the pure and primitive manner of the painters of Antiquity; but he took for his model a few fragments from earlier periods and a degenerate execution, and completely lost his way.\"\nIn 1820 Ingres and his wife moved to Florence at the urging of the Florentine sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini, an old friend from his years in Paris. He still had to depend upon his portraits and drawings for income, but his luck began to change. His history painting \"Roger Freeing Angelica\" was purchased for the private collection of Louis XVIII, and was hung in the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris, which was newly devoted to the work of living artists. This was the first work of Ingres to enter a museum.\nIn 1821, he finished a painting commissioned by a childhood friend, Monsieur de Pastoret, \"The Entry into Paris of the Dauphin, the Future Charles V\"; de Pastoret also ordered a portrait of himself and a religious work (\"Virgin with the Blue Veil\"). In August 1820, with the help of de Pastoret, he received a commission for a major religious painting for the Cathedral of Montauban. The theme was the re-establishment of the bond between the church and the state. Ingres's painting, \"The Vow of Louis XIII\" (1824), inspired by Raphael, was purely in the Renaissance style, and depicted King Louis XIII vowing to dedicate his reign to the Virgin Mary. This was perfectly in tune with the doctrine of the new government of the Restoration. He spent four years bringing the large canvas to completion, and he took it to the Paris Salon in October 1824, where it became the key that finally opened the door of the Paris art establishment and to his career as an official painter.\nReturn to Paris and retreat to Rome (1824\u20131834).\nThe \"Vow of Louis XIII\" in the Salon of 1824 finally brought Ingres critical success. Although Stendhal complained about \"the sort of material beauty which excludes the idea of divinity\", most critics praised the work. The journalist and future Prime Minister and French President Adolphe Thiers celebrated the breakthrough of a new style: \"Nothing is better than variety like this, the essential character of the new style.\" In January 1825 Ingres was awarded the Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by Charles X, and in June 1825 he was elected a member of Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts. Lithographs of \"La Grande Odalisque\" published in 1826 in two competing versions by Delpech and Sudr\u00e9 found eager buyers; Ingres received 24,000 francs for the reproduction rights \u2013 twenty times the amount he had been paid for the original painting six years earlier. The 1824 Salon also brought forward a counter-current to the neoclassicism of Ingres: Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix exhibited \"Les Massacres de Scio\", in a romantic style sharply contrasting to that of Ingres.\nThe success of Ingres's painting led in 1826 to a major new commission, \"The Apotheosis of Homer\", a giant canvas which celebrated all the great artists of history, intended to decorate the ceiling of one of the halls of the Museum Charles X at the Louvre. Ingres was unable to finish the work in time for the 1827 Salon, but displayed the painting in grisaille. The 1827 Salon became a confrontation between the neoclassicism of Ingres's \"Apotheosis\" and a new manifesto of romanticism by Delacroix, \"The Death of Sardanapalus\". Ingres joined the battle with enthusiasm; he called Delacroix \"the apostle of ugliness\" and told friends that he recognized \"the talent, the honorable character and distinguished spirit\" of Delacroix, but that \"he has tendencies which I believe are dangerous and which I must push back.\"\nDespite the considerable patronage he enjoyed under the Bourbon government, Ingres welcomed the July Revolution of 1830. That the outcome of the Revolution was not a republic but a constitutional monarchy was satisfactory to the essentially conservative and pacifistic artist, who in a letter to a friend in August 1830 criticized agitators who \"still want to soil and disturb the order and happiness of a freedom so gloriously, so divinely won.\" Ingres's career was little affected, and he continued to receive official commissions and honors under the July Monarchy.\nIngres exhibited in the Salon of 1833, where his portrait of \"Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Bertin\" (1832) was a particular success. The public found its realism spellbinding, although some of the critics declared its naturalism vulgar and its colouring drab. In 1834 he finished a large religious painting, \"The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian\", which depicted the first saint to be martyred in Gaul. The painting was commissioned in 1824 by the Ministry of the Interior for the Cathedral of Autun, and the iconography in the picture was specified by the bishop. Ingres conceived the painting as the summation of all of his work and skill, and worked on it for ten years before displaying it at the Salon of 1834. He was surprised, shocked and angered by the response; the painting was attacked by both the neoclassicists and by the romantics. Ingres was accused of historical inaccuracy, for the colours, and for the feminine appearance of the Saint, who looked like a beautiful statue. In anger, Ingres announced that he would no longer accept public commissions, and that he would no longer participate in the Salon. He later did participate in some semi-public expositions and a retrospective of his work at the 1855 Paris International Exposition, but never again took part in the Salon or submitted his work for public judgement. Instead, at the end of 1834 he returned to Rome to become the Director of the Academy of France.\nDirector of the French Academy in Rome (1834\u20131841).\nIngres remained in Rome for six years. He devoted much of his attention to the training of the painting students, as he was later to do at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He re-organized the Academy, increased the size of the library, added many molds of classical statues to the Academy collection, and assisted the students in getting public commissions in both Rome and Paris. He traveled to Orvieto (1835), Siena (1835), and to Ravenna and Urbino to study the paleochristian mosaics, medieval murals and Renaissance art. He devoted considerable attention to music, one of the subjects of the academy; he welcomed Franz Liszt and Fanny Mendelssohn. He formed a long friendship with Liszt. Composer Charles Gounod, who was a pensioner at the time at the Academy, described Ingres's appreciation of modern music, including Weber and Berlioz, and his adoration for Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart and Gluck. He joined the music students and his friend Niccol\u00f2 Paganini in playing Beethoven's violin works. Gounod wrote that Ingres \"had the tenderness of an infant and the indignation of an apostle.\" When Stendhal visited the Academy and disparaged Beethoven, Ingres turned to the doorman, indicated Stendhal, and told him, \"If this gentleman ever calls again, I am not here.\"\nHis rancor against the Paris art establishment for his failure at the 1834 Salon did not abate. In 1836 he refused a major commission from the French Minister of the Interior, Adolphe Thiers, to decorate the interior of the Church of the Madeleine in Paris, because the commission had been offered first to a rival, Paul Delaroche, who refused it. He did complete a small number of works which he sent to patrons in Paris. One was \"L'Odalisque et l'esclave\", (1839), a portrait of a blonde odalisque, or member of a harem, who reclines languorously while a turbaned musician plays. This fitted into the popular genre of orientalism; his rival Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix had created a painting on a similar theme, \"Les Femmes d'Alger\", for the 1834 Salon. The setting was inspired by Persian miniatures and was full of exotic detail, but the woman's long reclining form was pure Ingres. The critic Th\u00e9ophile Gautier wrote of Ingres's work: \"It is impossible to better paint the mystery, the silence and the suffocating atmosphere of the seraglio.\" In 1842 he painted a second version, nearly identical to the first but with a landscape background (painted by his student Paul Flandrin).\nThe second painting he sent, in 1840, was \"The Illness of Antiochus\" (1840; also known as \"Aniochus and Stratonice\") a history painting on a theme of love and sacrifice, a theme once painted by David in 1800, when Ingres was in his studio. It was commissioned by the Duc d'Orleans, the son of King Louis Philippe I), and had very elaborate architectural background designed by one of the Academy students, Victor Baltard, the future architect of the Paris market Les Halles. The central figure was an ethereal woman in a pastel robe, whose contemplative pose with her hand on her chin recurs in some of Ingres's female portraits.\nHis painting of Aniochius and Stratonice, despite its small size, just one meter, was a major success for Ingres. In August it was shown in the private apartment of the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans in the Pavilion Marsan of the Palais des Tuileries. The King greeted him personally at Versailles and gave him a tour of the Palace. He was offered a commission to paint a portrait of the Duke, the heir to the throne, and another from the Duc de Lunyes to create two huge murals for the Ch\u00e2teau de Dampierre. In April 1841 he returned definitively to Paris.\nLast years (1841\u20131867).\nOne of the first works executed after his return to Paris was a portrait of the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans. After the heir to the throne was killed in a carriage accident a few months after the painting was completed in 1842, Ingres received commissions to make additional copies. He also received a commission to design seventeen stained glass windows for the chapel on the place where the accident occurred, and a commission for eight additional stained-glass designs for Orl\u00e9ans chapel in Dreux. He became a professor at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He took his students frequently to the Louvre to the see the classical and Renaissance art, instructing them to look straight ahead and to avoid the works of Rubens, which he believed deviated too far from the true values of art.\nThe Revolution of 1848, which overthrew Louis Philippe and created the French Second Republic, had little effect on his work or his ideas. He declared that the revolutionaries were \"cannibals who called themselves French\", but during the Revolution completed his \"Venus Anadyomene\", which he had started as an academic study in 1808. It represented Venus, rising from the sea which had given birth to her, surrounded by cherubs. He welcomed the patronage of the new government of Louis-Napoleon, who in 1852 became Emperor Napoleon III.\nIn 1843 Ingres began the decorations of the great hall in the Ch\u00e2teau de Dampierre with two large murals, the \"Golden Age\" and the \"Iron Age\", illustrating the origins of art. He made more than five hundred preparatory drawings, and worked on the enormous project for six years. In an attempt to imitate the effect of Renaissance frescos, he chose to paint the murals in oil on plaster, which created technical difficulties. Work on the \"Iron Age\" never progressed beyond the architectural background painted by an assistant. Meanwhile, the growing crowd of nudes in the \"Golden Age\" discomfited Ingres's patron, the Duc de Luynes, and Ingres suspended work on the mural in 1847. Ingres was devastated by the loss of his wife, who died on 27 July 1849, and he was finally unable to complete the work. In July 1851, he announced a gift of his artwork to his native city of Montauban, and in October he resigned as professor at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts.\nHowever, in 1852, Ingres, then seventy-one years of age, married forty-three-year-old Delphine Ramel, a relative of his friend Marcotte d'Argenteuil. Ingres was rejuvenated, and in the decade that followed he completed several significant works, including the portrait of \"Princesse Albert de Broglie, n\u00e9e Jos\u00e9phine-El\u00e9onore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de B\u00e9arn\". In 1853 he began the \"Apotheosis of Napoleon I\", for the ceiling of a hall in the H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris. (It was destroyed in May 1871 when the Paris Commune set fire to the building.) With the help of assistants, in 1854 he completed another history painting, \"Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII\". A retrospective of his works was featured at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855, and in the same year Napoleon III named him a Grand Officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. In 1862 he was awarded the title of Senator, and made a member of the Imperial Council on Public Instruction. Three of his works were shown in the London International Exhibition, and his reputation as a major French painter was confirmed once more.\nHe continued to rework and refine his classic themes. In 1856 Ingres completed \"The Source\" (The Spring), a painting begun in 1820 and closely related to his \"Venus Anadyom\u00e9ne\". He painted two versions of \"Louis XIV and Moli\u00e8re\" (1857 and 1860), and produced variant copies of several of his earlier compositions. These included religious works in which the figure of the Virgin from \"The Vow of Louis XIII\" was reprised: \"The Virgin of the Adoption\" of 1858 (painted for Mademoiselle Roland-Gosselin) was followed by \"The Virgin Crowned\" (painted for Madame la Baronne de Larinthie) and \"The Virgin with Child\". In 1859 he produced new versions of \"The Virgin of the Host\", and in 1862 he completed \"Christ and the Doctors\", a work commissioned many years before by Queen Marie Amalie for the chapel of Bizy. He painted small replicas of \"Paolo and Francesca\" and \"Oedipus and the Sphinx\". In 1862 he completed a small oil-on-paper version of \"The Golden Age\". The last of his important portrait paintings date from this period: \"Marie-Clothilde-In\u00e9s de Foucauld, Madame Moitessier, Seated\" (1856), \"Self-Portrait at the Age of Seventy-eight\" and \"Madame J.-A.-D. Ingres, n\u00e9e Delphine Ramel\", both completed in 1859. At the request of the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, he made his own-self portrait in 1858. The only colour in the painting is the red of his rosette of the Legion of Honour.\nNear the end of his life, he made one of his best-known masterpieces, \"The Turkish Bath\". It reprised a figure and theme he had been painting since 1828, with his \"Petite Baigneuse\". Originally completed in a square format in 1852 and sold to Prince Napoleon in 1859, it was returned to the artist soon afterward\u2014according to a legend, Princess Clothilde was shocked by the abundant nudity. After reworking the painting as a \"tondo\", Ingres signed and dated it in 1862, although he made additional revisions in 1863. The painting was eventually purchased by a Turkish diplomat, Khalid Bey, who owned a large collection of nudes and erotic art, including several paintings by Courbet. The painting continued to cause a scandal long after Ingres was dead. It was initially offered to the Louvre in 1907, but was rejected, before being given to the Louvre in 1911.\nIngres died of pneumonia on 14 January 1867, at the age of eighty-six, in his apartment on the Quai Voltaire in Paris. He is interred in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris with a tomb sculpted by his student Jean-Marie Bonnassieux. The contents of his studio, including a number of major paintings, over 4000 drawings, and his violin, were bequeathed by the artist to the city museum of Montauban, now known as the Mus\u00e9e Ingres.\nStyle.\nIngres's style was formed early in life and changed comparatively little. His earliest drawings, such as the \"Portrait of a Man\" (or \"Portrait of an unknown\", 3\u00a0July 1797, now in the Louvre) already show a suavity of outline and an extraordinary control of the parallel hatchings which model the forms. From the first, his paintings are characterized by a firmness of outline reflecting his often-quoted conviction that \"drawing is the probity of art\". He believed colour to be no more than an accessory to drawing, explaining: \"Drawing is not just reproducing contours, it is not just the line; drawing is also the expression, the inner form, the composition, the modelling. See what is left after that. Drawing is seven eighths of what makes up painting.\"\nThe art historian Jean Clay said Ingres \"proceeded always from certitude to certitude, with the result that even his freest sketches reveal the same kind of execution as that found in the final works.\" In depicting the human body he disregarded rules of anatomy\u2014which he termed a \"dreadful science that I cannot think of without disgust\"\u2014in his quest for a sinuous arabesque. Abhorring the visible brushstroke, Ingres made no recourse to the shifting effects of colour and light on which the Romantic school depended; he preferred local colours only faintly modelled in light by half tones. \"Ce que l'on sait,\" he would repeat, \"il faut le savoir l'\u00e9p\u00e9e \u00e0 la main.\" (\"Whatever you know, you must know it with sword in hand.\") Ingres thus left himself without the means of producing the necessary unity of effect when dealing with crowded compositions, such as the \"Apotheosis of Homer\" and the \"Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian\". Among Ingres's historical and mythological paintings, the most satisfactory are usually those depicting one or two figures, such as \"Oedipus\", \"The Half-Length Bather\", \"Odalisque\", and \"The Spring\", subjects only animated by the consciousness of perfect physical well-being.\nIn \"Roger Freeing Angelica\", the female nude seems merely juxtaposed with the meticulously rendered but inert figure of Roger flying to the rescue on his hippogriff, for Ingres was rarely successful in the depiction of movement and drama. According to Sanford Schwartz, the \"historical, mythological, and religious pictures bespeak huge amounts of energy and industry, but, conveying little palpable sense of inner tension, are costume dramas ... The faces in the history pictures are essentially those of models waiting for the session to be over. When an emotion is to be expressed, it comes across stridently, or woodenly.\"\nIngres was averse to theories, and his allegiance to classicism\u2014with its emphasis on the ideal, the generalized, and the regular\u2014was tempered by his love of the particular. He believed that \"the secret of beauty has to be found through truth. The ancients did not create, they did not make; they recognized.\" In many of Ingres's works there is a collision between the idealized and the particular that creates what Robert Rosenblum termed an \"oil-and-water sensation\". This contradiction is vivid in \"Cherubini and the Muse of Lyric Poetry\" (1842), for example, in which the realistically painted 81-year-old composer is attended by an idealized muse in classical drapery.\nIngres's choice of subjects reflected his literary tastes, which were severely limited: he read and reread Homer, Virgil, Plutarch, Dante, histories, and the lives of the artists. Throughout his life he revisited a small number of favourite themes, and painted multiple versions of many of his major compositions. He did not share his age's enthusiasm for battle scenes, and generally preferred to depict \"moments of revelation or intimate decision manifested by meeting or confrontation, but never by violence.\" His numerous odalisque paintings were influenced to a great extent by the writings of Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the ambassador to Turkey whose diaries and letters, when published, fascinated European society.\nAlthough capable of painting quickly, he often laboured for years over a painting. Ingres's pupil Amaury-Duval wrote of him: \"With this facility of execution, one has trouble explaining why Ingres' oeuvre is not still larger, but he scraped out [his work] frequently, never being satisfied ... and perhaps this facility itself made him rework whatever dissatisfied him, certain that he had the power to repair the fault, and quickly, too.\" Ingres's \"Venus Anadyomene\" was begun in 1807 but not completed until 1848, after a long hiatus resulting from his indecision about the position of the arms. \"The Source\" (1856) had a similar history. It was begun in the 1820s as a sketch of \"such simplicity that one would suppose she had been painted in a single stroke\" according to Amaury-Duval, who believed that Ingres' reworking of the painting in 1855 was a loss.\nPortraits.\nWhile Ingres believed that history painting was the highest form of art, his modern reputation rests largely upon the exceptional quality of his portraits. By the time of his retrospective at the Exposition Universelle in 1855, an emerging consensus viewed his portrait paintings as his masterpieces. Their consistently high quality belies Ingres's often-stated complaint that the demands of portraiture robbed him of time he could have spent painting historical subjects. Baudelaire called him \"the sole man in France who truly makes portraits. The portraits of M. Bertin, M. Mol\u00e9 and Mme d'Haussonville are true portraits, that is, the ideal reconstruction of individuals...A good portrait seems to me always as a biography dramatized.\" His most famous portrait is that of Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Bertin, the chief editor of the \"Journal des Debats\", which was widely admired when it was exhibited at the 1833 Salon. Ingres had originally planned to paint Bertin standing, but many hours of effort ended in a creative impasse before he decided on a seated pose. \u00c9douard Manet described the resulting portrait as \"The Buddha of the Bourgeoisie\". The portrait quickly became a symbol of the rising economic and political power of Bertin's social class.\nFor his female portraits, he often posed the subject after a classical statue; the famous portrait of the Comtesse de'Haussonville may have been modeled after a Roman statue called \"Pudicity\" (\"modesty\") in the Vatican collection. Another trick that Ingres used was to paint the fabrics and details in the portraits with extreme precision and accuracy, but to idealize the face. The eye of the viewer would perceive the fabrics as realistic and would assume the face was equally true. His portraits of women range from the warmly sensuous \"Madame de Senonnes\" (1814) to the realistic \"Mademoiselle Jeanne Gonin\" (1821), the Junoesque \"Marie-Clothilde-In\u00e9s de Foucauld, Madame Moitessier\" (portrayed standing and seated, 1851 and 1856), and the chilly \"Jos\u00e9phine-El\u00e9onore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de B\u00e9arn, Princesse de Broglie\" (1853).\nDrawings.\nDrawing was the foundation of Ingres's art. In the Ecole des Beaux-Arts he excelled at figure drawing, winning the top prizes. During his years in Rome and Florence, he made hundreds of drawings of family, friends, and visitors, many of them of very high portrait quality. He never began a painting without first resolving the drawing, usually with a long series of drawing in which he refined the composition. In the case of his large history paintings, each figure in the painting was the subject of numerous sketches and studies as he tried different poses. He demanded that his students at the Academy and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts perfect their drawing before anything else; he declared that a \"thing well drawn is always a thing well painted\".\nHis portrait drawings, of which about 450 are extant, are today among his most admired works. While a disproportionate number of them date from his difficult early years in Italy, he continued to produce portrait drawings of his friends until the end of his life. Agnes Mongan has written of the portrait drawings:Before his departure in the fall of 1806 from Paris for Rome, the familiar characteristics of his drawing style were well established, the delicate yet firm contour, the definite yet discreet distortions of form, the almost uncanny capacity to seize a likeness in the precise yet lively delineation of features.The preferred materials were also already established: the sharply pointed graphite pencil on a smooth white paper. So familiar to us are both the materials and the manner that we forget how extraordinary they must have seemed at the time\u00a0... Ingres' manner of drawing was as new as the century. It was immediately recognized as expert and admirable. If his paintings were sternly criticized as \"Gothic,\" no comparable criticism was leveled at his drawings.\nHis student Raymond Balze described Ingres's working routine in executing his portrait drawings, each of which required four hours, as \"an hour and a half in the morning, then two-and-a-half hours in the afternoon, he very rarely retouched it the next day. He often told me that he got the essence of the portrait while lunching with the model who, off guard, became more natural.\" The resulting drawings, according to John Canaday, revealed the sitters' personalities by means so subtle\u2014and so free of cruelty\u2014that Ingres could \"expose the vanities of a fop, a silly woman, or a windbag, in drawings that delighted them.\"\nIngres drew his portrait drawings on wove paper, which provided a smooth surface very different from the ribbed surface of laid paper (which is, nevertheless, sometimes referred to today as \"Ingres paper\"). The early drawings are characterized by very taut contours drawn with sharply pointed graphite, while later drawings show freer lines and more emphatic modeling, drawn with a softer, blunter graphite.\nDrawings made in preparation for paintings, such as the many studies for \"The Martyrdom of St. Symphorian\" and \"The Golden Age\", are more varied in size and treatment than are the portrait drawings. It was his usual practice to make many drawings of nude models, in search of the most eloquent gesture, before making another series of drawings for the draperies. In his early years he sometimes had his model pose behind a translucent veil that suppressed details and emphasized the arabesque. He often used female models when testing poses for male figures, as he did in drawings for \"Jesus Among the Doctors\". Nude studies exist even for some of his commissioned portraits, but these were drawn using hired models.\nIngres drew a number of landscape views while in Rome, but he painted only one pure landscape, the small tondo \"Raphael's Casino\" (although two other small landscape tondos are sometimes attributed to him).\nColour.\nFor Ingres, colour played an entirely secondary role in art. He wrote, \"Colour adds ornament to a painting; but it is nothing but the handmaiden, because all it does is to render more agreeable the true perfections of the art. Rubens and Van Dyck can be pleasing at first sight, but they are deceptive; they are from the poor school of colourists, the school of deception. Never use bright colours, they are anti-historic. It is better to fall into gray than to into bright colours.\" The Institute in Paris complained in 1838 that the students of Ingres in Rome \"had a deplorable lack of knowledge of the truth and power of colour, and a knowledge of the different effects of light. A dull and opaque effect is found in all their canvases. They seem to have only been lit by twilight.\" The poet and critic Baudelaire observed: \"the students of M. Ingres have very uselessly avoided any semblance of colour; they believe or pretend to believe that they are not needed in painting.\"\nIngres's own paintings vary considerably in their use of colour, and critics were apt to fault them as too grey or, contrarily, too jarring. Baudelaire\u2014who said \"M. Ingres adores colour like a fashionable milliner\"\u2014wrote of the portraits of Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Bertin and Madame d'Haussonville: \"Open your eyes, nation of simpletons, and tell us if you ever saw such dazzling, eye-catching painting, or even a greater elaboration of colour\". Ingres's paintings are often characterized by strong local colours, such as the \"acid blues and bottle greens\" Kenneth Clark professed to \"perversely enjoy\" in \"La Grande Odalisque\". In other works, especially in his less formal portraits such as the \"Mademoiselle Jeanne-Suzanne-Catherine Gonin\" (1821), colour is restrained.\nIngres and Delacroix.\nIngres and Delacroix became, in the mid-19th century, the most prominent representatives of the two competing schools of art in France, neoclassicism and romanticism. Neo-classicism was based in large part on the philosophy of Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717\u20131768), who wrote that art should embody \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\". Many painters followed this course, including Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard, Antoine-Jean Gros, Anne-Louis Girodet, and Jacques-Louis David, the teacher of Ingres. A competing school, romanticism, emerged first in Germany, and moved quickly to France. It rejected the idea of the imitation of classical styles, which it described as \"gothic\" and \"primitive\". The Romanticists in French painting were led by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault and especially Delacroix. The rivalry first emerged at the Paris Salon of 1824, where Ingres exhibited \"The Vow of Louis XIII\", inspired by Raphael, while Delacroix showed \"The Massacre at Chios\", depicting a tragic event in the Greek War of Independence. Ingres's painting was calm, static and carefully constructed, while the work of Delacroix was turbulent, full of motion, colour, and emotion.\nThe dispute between the two painters and schools reappeared at the 1827 Salon, where Ingres presented \"L'Apotheose d'Homer\", an example of classical balance and harmony, while Delacroix showed \"The Death of Sardanapalus\", another glittering and tumultuous scene of violence. The duel between the two painters, each considered the best of his school, continued over the years. Paris artists and intellectuals were passionately divided by the conflict, although modern art historians tend to regard Ingres and other Neoclassicists as embodying the Romantic spirit of their time.\nAt the 1855 Universal Exposition, both Delacroix and Ingres were well represented. The supporters of Delacroix and the romantics heaped abuse on the work of Ingres. The Brothers Goncourt described \"the miserly talent\" of Ingres: \"Faced with history, M. Ingres calls vainly to his assistance a certain wisdom, decency, convenience, correction and a reasonable dose of the spiritual elevation that a graduate of a college demands. He scatters persons around the center of the action ... tosses here and there an arm, a leg, a head perfectly drawn, and thinks that his job is done...\"\nBaudelaire also, previously sympathetic toward Ingres, shifted toward Delacroix. \"M. Ingres can be considered a man gifted with high qualities, an eloquent evoker of beauty, but deprived of the energetic temperament which creates the fatality of genius.\"\nDelacroix himself was merciless toward Ingres. Describing the exhibition of works by Ingres at the 1855 Exposition, he called it \"ridiculous ... presented, as one knows, in a rather pompous fashion ... It is the complete expression of an incomplete intelligence; effort and pretension are everywhere; nowhere is there found a spark of the natural.\"\nAccording to Ingres' student Paul Chenavard, later in their careers, Ingres and Delacroix accidentally met on the steps of the French Institute; Ingres put his hand out, and the two shook amicably.\nPupils.\nIngres was a conscientious teacher and was greatly admired by his students. The best known of them is Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau, who studied with him from 1830, as a precocious eleven-year-old, until Ingres closed his studio in 1834 to return to Rome. Ingres considered Chass\u00e9riau his truest disciple\u2014even predicting, according to an early biographer, that he would be \"the Napoleon of painting\". \nBy the time Chass\u00e9riau visited Ingres in Rome in 1840, however, the younger artist's growing allegiance to the romantic style of Delacroix was apparent, leading Ingres to disown his favourite student, of whom he subsequently spoke rarely and censoriously. No other artist who studied under Ingres succeeded in establishing a strong identity; among the most notable of them were Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, Henri Lehmann, and Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury-Duval.\nInfluence on modern art.\nIngres's influence on later generations of artists was considerable. One of his heirs was Degas, who studied under Louis Lamothe, a minor disciple of Ingres. In the 20th century, his influence was even stronger. Picasso and Matisse were among those who acknowledged a debt to Ingres; Matisse described him as the first painter \"to use pure colours, outlining them without distorting them.\" The startling effects of Ingres's paintings\u2014the collapsing of traditional depth and perspective and the presentation of figures \"like the figures in a deck of cards\"\u2014were criticized in the 19th century but were welcomed by the avant-garde in the 20th century.\nAn important retrospective of works by Ingres was held at the Salon d'automne in Paris in 1905, which was visited by Picasso, Matisse, and many other artists. The original and striking composition of \"The Turkish Bath\", shown for the first time in public, had a visible influence on the composition and poses of the figures in Picasso's \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" in 1907. The exhibit also included many of his studies for the unfinished mural \"l'Age d'or\", including a striking drawing of women gracefully dancing in a circle. Matisse produced his own version on this composition in his painting \"La Danse\" in 1909. The particular pose and colouring of Ingres's \"Portrait of Monsieur Bertin\" also made a reappearance in Picasso's \"Portrait of Gertrude Stein\" (1906).\nBarnett Newman credited Ingres as a progenitor of abstract expressionism, explaining: \"That guy was an abstract painter\u00a0... He looked at the canvas more often than at the model. Kline, de Kooning\u2014none of us would have existed without him.\"\nPierre Barousse, the curator of the Mus\u00e9e Ingres, wrote: ...One realizes in how many ways a variety of artists claim him as their master, from the most plainly conventional of the nineteenth century such as Cabanel or Bouguereau, to the most revolutionary of our century from Matisse to Picasso. A classicist? Above all, he was moved by the impulse to penetrate the secret of natural beauty and to reinterpret it through its own means; an attitude fundamentally different to that of David\u00a0... there results a truly personal and unique art admired as much by the Cubists for its plastic autonomy, as by the Surrealists for its visionary qualities.\nIngres is one of the most cited artists in the interpictural compositions of the Peruvian painter Herman Braun-Vega. The latter dedicated an entire exhibition to him in 2006 on the occasion of the year dedicated to Ingres in France museums.\n\"Violon d'Ingres\".\nIngres's well-known passion for playing the violin gave rise to a common expression in the French language, \"violon d'Ingres\", meaning a second skill beyond the one by which a person is mainly known.\nIngres was an amateur violin player from his youth, and played for a time as second violinist for the orchestra of Toulouse. When he was Director of the French Academy in Rome, he played frequently with the music students and guest artists. Charles Gounod, who was a student under Ingres at the Academy, merely noted that \"he was not a professional, even less a virtuoso\". Along with the student musicians, he performed Beethoven string quartets with Niccol\u00f2 Paganini. In an 1839 letter, Franz Liszt described his playing as \"charming\", and planned to play through all the Mozart and Beethoven violin sonatas with Ingres. Liszt also dedicated his transcriptions of the 5th and 6th symphonies of Beethoven to Ingres on their original publication in 1840.\nThe American avant-garde artist Man Ray used this expression as the title of a famous photograph portraying Alice Prin (aka Kiki de Montparnasse) in the pose of the \"Valpin\u00e7on Bather\" with two f-holes painted on to make her body resemble a violin.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48034", "revid": "50900800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48034", "title": "Anzac Day", "text": "National day of remembrance in Australia, New Zealand and Tonga on 25 April\nAnzac Day is a national day of remembrance in Australia, New Zealand and Tonga that broadly commemorates all Australians and New Zealanders \"who served and died in all wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations\" and \"the contribution and suffering of all those who have served\". Observed on 25 April each year, Anzac Day was originally devised to honour the members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who served in the Gallipoli campaign, their first engagement in the First World War (1914\u20131918).\nHistory.\nAnzac Day marks the anniversary of the first campaign that led to major casualties for Australian and New Zealand forces during the First World War. The acronym ANZAC stands for Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, whose soldiers were known as Anzacs. Anzac Day remains one of the most important national occasions of both Australia and New Zealand; however, the ceremonies and their meanings have changed significantly since 1915. According to Martin Crotty, a historian at the University of Queensland, Anzac commemorations have \"suited political purposes right from 1916 when the first Anzac Day march was held in London and Australia, which were very much around trying to get more people to sign up to the war in 1916\u20131918\".\nGallipoli campaign, 1915.\nIn 1915, Australian and New Zealand soldiers formed part of an Allied expedition that set out to capture the Gallipoli Peninsula in the Ottoman Empire to open the way to the Black Sea for the Allied navies. The objective was to capture Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, which was a member of the Central Powers during the war. The ANZAC force landed at Gallipoli on 25 April, meeting fierce resistance from the Ottoman Army commanded by Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atat\u00fcrk). What had been planned as a bold strike to knock the Ottomans out of the war quickly became a stalemate, and the campaign dragged on for eight months. At the end of 1915, the Allied forces were evacuated after both sides had suffered heavy casualties and endured great hardships. The Allied deaths totalled over 56,000, including 8,709 from Australia and 2,721 from New Zealand. News of the landing at Gallipoli made a profound impact on Australians and New Zealanders at home and 25 April quickly became the day on which they remembered the sacrifice of those who had died in the war.\nThough the Gallipoli campaign failed to achieve its military objectives of capturing Constantinople and knocking the Ottoman Empire out of the war, the actions of the Australian and New Zealand troops during the campaign bequeathed an intangible but powerful legacy. The creation of what became known as an Anzac legend became an important part of the national identity in both countries. This has shaped the way their citizens have viewed both their past and their understanding of the present. The heroism of the soldiers in the failed Gallipoli campaign made their sacrifices iconic in New Zealand memory, and is often credited with securing the psychological independence of the nation.\nFrom 1915 to World War II.\nOn 30 April 1915, when the first news of the landing reached New Zealand, a half-day holiday was declared and impromptu services were held.\nAdelaide, South Australia, was the site of Australia's first built memorial to the Gallipoli landing, unveiled by Governor-General Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson on Wattle Day, 7 September 1915, just over four months after the first landings. The monument was originally the centrepiece of the Wattle Day League's Gallipoli Memorial Wattle Grove on Sir Lewis Cohen Avenue in the South Park Lands. The original native pines and remnant seedlings of the original wattles still grow in Wattle Grove, but in 1940 the Adelaide City Council moved the monument and its surrounding pergola a short distance away to Lundie Gardens. Also in South Australia, Eight Hour Day, 13 October 1915, was renamed Anzac Day and a carnival was organised to raise money for the Wounded Soldiers Fund. The name Anzac Day was chosen through a competition, won by Robert Wheeler, a draper of Prospect.\nMelbourne observed an Anzac Remembrance Day on 17 December 1915.\nAnniversary commemorations started in Queensland. On 10 January 1916, Canon David John Garland was appointed the honorary secretary of the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland (ADCCQ) at a public meeting which endorsed 25 April as the date to be promoted as \"Anzac Day\" in 1916 and ever after. Queensland Premier T. J. Ryan urged the other Australian states to enact a similar parade, and soon the date became a national day of reflection. Devoted to the cause of a non-denominational commemoration that could be attended by the whole of Australian society, Garland worked amicably across all denominational divides, creating the framework for Anzac Day commemorative services. Garland is specifically credited with initiating the Anzac Day march, the wreath-laying ceremonies at memorials and the special church services, the two minutes of silence, and the luncheon for returned soldiers. Garland intended the silence to be used in lieu of a prayer to allow the Anzac Day service to be universally attended, allowing attendees to make a silent prayer or remembrance in accordance with their own beliefs. He particularly feared that the universality of the ceremony would fall victim to religious sectarian disputes. The State Library of Queensland holds the minutes from the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland; the collection has been digitised and available to view online. In 2019, the collection was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Australian Register.\nThe date 25 April was officially named Anzac Day in 1916; in that year, it was marked by a wide variety of ceremonies and services in Australia, New Zealand and London. In New Zealand, it was gazetted as a half-day holiday. Over 2,000 people attended the service in Rotorua. In London, over 2,000 Australian and New Zealand troops marched through the streets of the city. An unnamed London newspaper reputedly dubbed them \"The Knights of Gallipoli\". Marches were held all over Australia; wounded soldiers from Gallipoli attended the Sydney march in convoys of cars, accompanied by nurses.\nIn Egypt, General John Monash paraded the troops on Anzac Day 1916.\nFor the remaining years of the war, Anzac Day was used as an occasion for patriotic rallies and recruiting campaigns, and marches of serving members of the AIF were held in most cities. From 1916 onwards, in both Australia and New Zealand, Anzac memorials were held on or about 25 April, mainly organised by returned servicemen and school children in cooperation with local authorities. Early morning services were solemn, with a more upbeat tone set for honouring returned soldiers during afternoon activities.\nAustralian troops did not return to great victory parades at the end of the war. This was partly because their arrival home depended on available shipping, but also because of the influenza epidemic of 1919, which prevented people assembling in large numbers. The 1919 Sydney parade was cancelled as a result, but a public commemorative service was held in the Domain, where participants were required to wear masks and stand three feet apart.\nAnzac Day was gazetted as a public holiday in New Zealand in 1920, through the Anzac Day Act, after lobbying by the New Zealand Returned Services' Association, the RSA.\nIn Australia at the 1921 State Premiers' Conference, it was decided that Anzac Day would be observed on 25 April each year. However, it was not observed uniformly in all the states until 1922 when the States were invited to co-operate with the Commonwealth in observing the day, and an invitation was telegraphed to the various religious bodies suggesting that memorial services be held in the morning. In the early 1920s returned soldiers mostly commemorated Anzac Day informally, primarily as a means of keeping in contact with each other. But as time passed and they inevitably began to drift apart, the ex-soldiers perceived a need for an institutionalised reunion. During the late 1920s, Anzac Day became established as a National Day of Commemoration for the 60,000 Australians and 18,000 New Zealanders who died during the war. The first year in which all the Australian states observed some form of public holiday together on Anzac Day was 1927. By the mid-1930s, all the rituals now associated with the day\u00a0\u2013 dawn vigils, marches, memorial services, reunions, two-up games\u00a0\u2013 became part of Australian Anzac Day culture. New Zealand commemorations also adopted many of these rituals, with the dawn service being introduced from Australia in 1939.\nChanges after World War II.\nWith the coming of the Second World War, Anzac Day became a day on which to commemorate the lives of Australians and New Zealanders which were lost in that war as well and in subsequent wars. The meaning of the day has been further broadened to include those killed in all the military operations in which the countries have been involved. Anzac Day was first commemorated at the Australian War Memorial in 1942, but, due to government orders preventing large public gatherings in case of Japanese air attack, it was a small affair and was neither a march nor a memorial service. Anzac Day has been annually commemorated at the Australian War Memorial ever since. In New Zealand, Anzac Day saw a surge in popularity immediately after World War II.\nDecline in popularity.\nBy the 1950s, many New Zealanders had become antagonistic or indifferent towards the day. Much of this was linked to the legal ban on commerce on Anzac Day, and the banning by many local authorities of sports events and other entertainment on the day. Annoyance was particularly pronounced in 1953 and 1959, when Anzac Day fell on a Saturday. There was widespread public debate on the issue, with some people calling for the public holiday to be moved to the nearest Sunday or abolished altogether. In 1966, a new \"Anzac Day Act\" was passed, allowing sport and entertainment in the afternoon.\nDuring and after Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War (1962\u20131975), interest in Anzac Day reached its lowest point in Australia. On 26 April 1975, \"The Australian\" newspaper covered the passing of Anzac Day in a single story. In the 1960s and 1970s, anti-war protesters used Anzac Day events as a platform to voice opposition to conscription and Australia's military involvement in general; in the following 20 years, the relevance of Australia's war connection with the British Empire was brought into question. In 1967, two members of the left-wing Progressive Youth Movement in Christchurch staged a minor protest at the Anzac Day ceremony, laying a wreath protesting against the Vietnam War. They were subsequently convicted of disorderly conduct. In 1978, a women's group laid a wreath dedicated to all the women raped and killed during war, and movements for feminism, gay rights, and peace used the occasion to draw attention to their respective causes at various times during the 1980s. In 1981, the group Women Against Rape in War marched up Anzac Parade towards the Australian War Memorial to lay their wreath at the Stone of Remembrance. At the head of the procession, women held a banner which read, \"In memory of all women of all countries raped in all wars.\" More than 60 women were arrested by police. Following this time, there were calls for a new type of comradeship that did not discriminate based on sex or race.\n1990s\u20132010s: Revival.\nIn 1990, to mark the 75th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing, many of the last surviving Gallipoli veterans along with government officials from Australia and New Zealand, including Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and New Zealand governor-general Paul Reeves, travelled to Turkey for a special Dawn Service at Gallipoli.\nBob Hawke was the first Australian Prime Minister to visit Turkey to pay respect to the fallen. Prime Minister John Howard was also a huge proponent of Anzac Day commemorations, and visited Gallipoli on 25 April in both 2000 and 2005.\nAn increasing number of attendees have been young Australians, many of whom attend ceremonies swathed in Australian flags, wearing green-and-gold T-shirts and beanies and with Australian flag tattoos imprinted on their skin. This phenomenon has been perceived by some as a reflection of the desire of younger generations of Australians to honour the sacrifices made by the previous generations.\nAustralians and New Zealanders recognise 25 April as a ceremonial occasion to reflect on the cost of war and to remember those who fought and died in war. Commemorative services and marches are held at dawn, the time of the original landing, mainly at war memorials in cities and towns across both nations and the sites of some of Australia and New Zealand's more-recognised battles and greatest losses, including Villers-Bretonneux in France and Gallipoli in Turkey.\nOne of the traditions of Anzac Day is the gunfire breakfast (coffee with rum added) which occurs shortly after many dawn ceremonies, and recalls the \"breakfast\" taken by many soldiers before facing battle. Later in the day, ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen meet and join in marches through the major cities and many smaller centres.\nIn 2018, female veterans were encouraged to march at the front of their sections. The \"By The Left\" initiative was launched following a number of reported cases where servicewomen had been challenged that they were wearing their medals on the wrong side, as people should wear their own medals on the left side of their chest, but people marching in place of their parents or other ancestors should wear that person's medals on the right side.\nAccording to historian Carolyn Holbrook of Deakin University, \"We reached Peak Anzac in 2015[,] sure, and there has been some backing off since then, but in terms of the dawn services and Anzac Day commemoration, it will remain huge for a good while yet... There is nothing better to take its place in terms of a national mythology.\"\nIn recent years, there has been greater recognition of the often overlooked role that women, immigrants and Indigenous Australians played in the wars, in the news and in the arts. \"Black Diggers\", which premiered at the Sydney Festival, told the stories of the Aboriginal men who enlisted, whose sacrifices were ignored, and who were quickly forgotten upon their return. Country Arts SA's \"Aboriginal Diggers Project\" is a 3-year project (2017\u20132019) capturing the stories and experiences of Aboriginal servicemen and women who have served in Australia's Military from the Boer War to the present day through film, theatre and visual arts.\n2020\u20132022: COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2020, most Anzac Day marches in Australia and New Zealand were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of the cancellation of the service, two Army veterans, Bill Sowry and Terry James, suggested standing in front of the driveways to observe a minute of silence; and, at the same time, Justin Wilbur, the son of a Vietnam veteran, offered to light a candle as a tribute to the soldiers. He created a Facebook group \"Aussies and Kiwis for ANZACS\", and Ashleigh Leckie, a Navy veteran, combined their ideas and put forth what we now know as the \"Driveway at Dawn\" movement. This movement was later adopted by the RSL and RSA and was consequently renamed \"Light up the Dawn\" and \"Stand at Dawn\". In the United Kingdom, Kathy Lette presented a Zoom performance of \"The One Day of the Year\" with five actors performing from their homes.\nIn 2021, major state marches occurred although under pandemic restriction settings such as in Queensland and the Northern Territory, others with ticketing and/or restrictions on numbers marching and watching, such as the national event in Canberra, Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. Overseas services were not held. Services did not happen in Perth as on 24 April Perth city and the Peel region entered a sudden 3 day COVID-19 lockdown and Anzac Day services in the affected areas were cancelled.\nIn 2022, dawn services returned in both Australia and in Gallipoli. The end of pandemic restriction meant crowds returned to pre-pandemic levels in Queensland New South Wales South Australia, Victoria, The ACT, Tasmania and the Northern Territory where Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Deputy Opposition Leader Richard Marles (representing Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese who was sick with COVID at the time) attended a dawn service. Perth saw the return of the dawn service for the first time in three years albeit with only 500 attendees due to ongoing COVID restrictions. Dawn services occurred in New Zealand but parades were cancelled due to the pandemic.\nPost-pandemic: 2023\u2013present.\nIn 2023, 30,000 attended the Canberra war memorial service, continuing a trend since 2015 of declining crowds.\nIn 2025, a bill was introduced by the New Zealand Government to change the official scope of ANZAC Day to include all persons, enlisted or not, who served New Zealand in times of war. This expands the previous definition, which was limited to service members who were involved in wars from World War I to the Vietnam War and service members who had died at any point. Neither definition involves participants in the New Zealand Wars, although they are recognised on the National Day of Commemoration for the New Zealand Wars, albeit not with a public holiday.\nAs a public holiday.\nANZAC Day is a public holiday in Australia, New Zealand and Tonga (including in the dependencies of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Cook Islands, Niue, Norfolk Island and Tokelau).\nDawn service and commemoration in Australia.\nDawn service.\nA dawn service was held on the Western Front by an Australian battalion on the first anniversary of the Gallipoli landing on 25 April 1916, and historians agree that in Australia dawn services spontaneously popped up around the country to commemorate the fallen at Gallipoli in the years after this. The timing of the dawn service, traditionally held at 4:28am, is based on the time that the ANZAC forces started the landing on the Gallipoli peninsula, but also has origins in a combination of military, symbolic and religious traditions. Various stories name different towns as having the first ever service in Australia, including Albany, Western Australia, but no definite proof has been found to corroborate any of them. In Rockhampton, Queensland on 26 April 1916, over 600 people attended an interdenominational service that started at 6:30am. However, the dawn service held at the Sydney Cenotaph in 1928 can lay claim to being the first of a continuous tradition. The 1931 service at the Cenotaph was the first attended by the Governor and representatives of state and federal governments.\nDawn services were originally very simple and in many cases they were restricted to veterans only, to remember and reflect among the comrades with whom they shared a special bond. Before dawn the gathered veterans would be ordered to stand-to and a lone bugler would play the \"Last Post\". Two minutes of silence would follow, concluded with the \"Reveille\". In more recent times the families of veterans and the general public have been encouraged to take part in dawn services. Some of the ceremonies have also become more elaborate, incorporating hymns, prayer readings, laying of wreaths, laments and the playing of God Defend New Zealand and Advance Australia Fair, but others have retained the simple format of the dawn stand-to. The fourth stanza of Laurence Binyon's poem \"\" (known as the \"Ode of Remembrance\", or simply as \"the Ode\") is often recited.\nCommemorative services and traditions.\nDespite federation being proclaimed in Australia in 1901, it is argued that the national identity of Australia was largely forged during the violent conflict of World War I, and the most iconic event in the war for most Australians was the landing at Gallipoli. Dr. Paul Skrebels of the University of South Australia has noted that Anzac Day has continued to grow in popularity; even the threat of a terrorist attack at the Gallipoli site in 2004 did not deter some 15,000 Australians from making the pilgrimage to Turkey to commemorate the fallen ANZAC troops.\nIn cities and towns nationwide, marches by veterans from all past wars, as well as current serving members of the Australian Defence Force and Reserves, allied veterans, Australian Defence Force Cadets and Australian Air League, members of Scouts Australia, Guides Australia, and other service groups take place. The Anzac Day March from each state capital is televised live with commentary. These events are generally followed by social gatherings of veterans, hosted either in a public house or in an RSL club, often including a traditional Australian gambling game called two-up, which was an extremely popular pastime with ANZAC soldiers. (In most Australian states and territories, gambling is forbidden outside of licensed venues; however, due to the significance of this tradition, two-up is legal only on Anzac Day.)\nA National Ceremony is held at the Australian War Memorial, starting at 10:30 am, with the traditional order of service including the Commemorative Address, wreath laying, hymns, the sounding of the Last Post, observance of one minute's silence, and the national anthems of Australia and New Zealand. Families often place artificial red poppies beside the names of relatives on the Memorial's Roll of Honour. Sprigs of rosemary or laurel are often worn on lapels.\nAlthough commemoration events are always held on 25 April, most states and territories currently observe a substitute public holiday on the following Monday when Anzac Day falls on a Sunday. When Anzac Day falls on Easter Monday, such as in 2011, the Easter Monday holiday is transferred to Tuesday. This followed a 2008 meeting of the Council for the Australian Federation in which the states and territories made an in-principle agreement to work towards making this a universal practice. However, in 2009, the Legislative Council of Tasmania rejected a bill amendment that would have enabled the substitute holiday in that state.\nCommemorative postage stamps.\nAustralia Post has issued stamps over the years to commemorate Anzac Day, the first being in 1935 for the 20th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.\nThe list of issued stamps includes:\nAustralian rules football.\nDuring many wars, Australian rules football matches have been played overseas in places like northern Africa, Vietnam, and Iraq as a celebration of Australian culture and as a bonding exercise between soldiers.\nThe modern-day tradition began in 1995 and is played every year between traditional AFL rivals Collingwood and Essendon at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. This annual match is often considered the biggest of the AFL season outside of the finals, sometimes drawing bigger crowds than all but the Grand Final, and often selling out in advance. The inaugural match in 1995 drew a crowd of 94,825 people, with the 2023 match drawing a crowd of 95,179, the second biggest home and away crowd in AFL history. The Anzac Medal is awarded to the player in the match who best exemplifies the Anzac spirit \u2013 skill, courage, self-sacrifice, teamwork and fair play. As of 2024, Collingwood hold the advantage 17 wins to 10, with two draws (in 1995 and 2024). The match was not played in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2013, St Kilda and the Sydney Swans played an Anzac Day game in Wellington, New Zealand, the first AFL game played for premiership points outside of Australia. The winning team, Sydney, were presented with the inaugural Simpson\u2013Henderson Trophy by the Prime Minister of New Zealand. The trophy was named after two notable Anzac soldiers: John Simpson Kirkpatrick and Richard Alexander Henderson.\nRugby League football.\nBeginning in 1997, the Anzac Test, a rugby league test match, commemorated Anzac Day, though it was typically played prior to Anzac Day. The match was always played between the Australian and New Zealand national teams, and drew attendances of between 20,000 and 45,000 spectators. The final Anzac test occurred in 2017.\nDomestically, matches have been played on Anzac Day since 1927 (with occasional exceptions). Since 2002, the National Rugby League (NRL) has followed the lead of the Australian Football League, hosting a match between traditional rivals St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Sydney Roosters each year to commemorate Anzac Day in the ANZAC Day Cup, although these two sides had previously met on Anzac Day several times as early as the 1970s. Between 2009 and 2023, an additional Anzac Day game has been played between the Melbourne Storm and New Zealand Warriors; the South Sydney Rabbitohs replaced the New Zealand Warriors in 2024. The Warriors still play on Anzac Day but in New Zealand and against a different opponent each year.\nCommemoration in New Zealand.\nNew Zealand's commemoration of Anzac Day is similar. The number of New Zealanders attending Anzac Day events in New Zealand, and at Gallipoli, is increasing. For some, the day adds weight to the idea that war is futile.\nDawn marches and other memorials nationwide are typically attended by the New Zealand Defence Force, the New Zealand Cadet Forces, members of the New Zealand Police, Fire and Emergency New Zealand, Order of St John Ambulance Service (Youth and Adult Volunteers) as well as Scouting New Zealand, GirlGuiding New Zealand and other uniformed community service groups including in most places the local pipe band to lead or accompany the march, and sometimes a brass band to accompany the hymns.\nAnzac Day now promotes a sense of unity, perhaps more effectively than any other day on the national calendar. People whose politics, beliefs and aspirations are widely different can nevertheless share a genuine sorrow at the loss of so many lives in war.\nPaper poppies are widely distributed by the Returned Services Association and worn as symbols of remembrance. This tradition follows that of the wearing of poppies on Remembrance Sunday in other Commonwealth countries.\nThe day is a public holiday in New Zealand. Shops are prohibited from opening before 1\u00a0pm under the \"Shop Trading Hours Act 1990\". A prior act passed in 1949 prevented the holiday from being Mondayised (moved to the 26th or 27th should the 25th fall on a weekend), although this drew criticism from trade unionists and Labour Party politicians. In 2013, a member's bill introduced by Labour MP David Clark to Mondayise Anzac Day and Waitangi Day passed, despite opposition from the governing National Party.\nCommemoration at Gallipoli.\nIn Turkey the name ANZAC Cove was officially recognised by the Turkish government on Anzac Day in 1985. That year, a monolith installed at Ari Burnu Cemetery (ANZAC Beach) was inscribed with a quotation attributed to Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in 1934:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives ... You are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours ... You, the mothers who sent their sons from faraway countries, wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well.\nThe words also appear on the Kemal Atat\u00fcrk Memorial, Canberra, and the Atat\u00fcrk Memorial in Wellington. However, despite the common attribution to Atat\u00fcrk by governments and politicians from Australia and Turkey, historians have found no direct evidence that Atat\u00fcrk ever spoke these words. A version of the quote first appeared in 1953 from a Turkish journalist with the later inclusion of the phrase \"There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets\" emerging in 1978.\nIn 1990, to mark the 75th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing, government officials from Australia and New Zealand, including Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and New Zealand governor-general Paul Reeves, as well as most of the last surviving Gallipoli veterans, travelled to Turkey for a special Dawn Service at Gallipoli. The Gallipoli Dawn Service was held at the Ari Burnu War Cemetery at Anzac Cove, but the growing numbers of people attending resulted in the construction of a more spacious site on North Beach, known as the Anzac Commemorative Site in time for the year 2000 service.\nA ballot was held to allocate passes for Australians and New Zealanders wishing to attend Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli in 2015. Of the 10,500 people who could be safely, securely and comfortably accommodated at the Anzac Commemorative Site, in 2015 this comprised places for 8,000 Australians, 2,000 New Zealanders and 500 official representatives of all nations involved in the Gallipoli campaign. Only those who received an offer of attendance passes attended the commemorations in 2015.\nCommemoration in other countries.\nMalaysia.\nThe Australian Borneo Exhibition Group organises annual trips for ANZAC veterans and students to commemorate World War II in the states of Sabah and Sarawak.\nUnited Kingdom.\nANZAC day is officially observed in the United Kingdom, and has been since 1916, and is commemorated at events in London and around the country, but the day does not have public holiday status like in Australia and New Zealand.\nCommercialisation.\nFrom the beginning, there has been concern to protect the Anzac tradition from inappropriate use. In Australia, use of the word \"Anzac\" is regulated under the \"Protection of Word \"Anzac\" Act 1920\". The \"Protection of Word 'Anzac' Regulations 1921\" state that: \"no person may use the word 'Anzac', or any word resembling it, in connection with any trade, business, calling or profession or in connection with any entertainment or any lottery or art union or as the name or part of a name of any private residence, boat, vehicle of charitable or other institution, or other institution, or any building without the authority of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs\". The maximum penalty is 12 months imprisonment, or $10,200 for a person and $51,000 for a corporation.\nOver recent years, some historians and commentators have raised concerns over what they see as the increasing commercialisation of Anzac Day. In 2015, historian Carolyn Holbrook stated that companies were seeking to associate themselves with Anzac Day as \"Anzac is the most potent and popular brand going around in Australia today.\" Questionable Anzac marketing campaigns included Woolworths' Fresh in Our Memories campaign in 2015, which provoked a strong public backlash. According to Holbrook, Anzac Day is more sacred than Easter or Christmas to many. Historian professor Joan Beaumont, researcher Jo Hawkins and historical commentator David Stephens have argued that the federal government has not been sufficiently enforcing regulations which limit the extent to which companies can refer to Anzac Day, or use the word Anzac, in their marketing. There has been widespread public opposition to the more blatant attempts to commercialise Anzac Day, which has led to some products being withdrawn from sale. Many of the products associated with the centenary of the Gallipoli landings were also commercial failures.\nA notable exception is the manufacture and sale of the Anzac biscuit, originally home made to published recipes from about 1920, and for many decades manufactured commercially for retail sale in both Australia and New Zealand. Commercial manufacture and sale of the biscuits is explicitly exempted from restrictions on the use of the word Anzac.\nCriticism of some commemorations.\nFor decades, there have been concerns that the participation of young people in Anzac Day events has injected a carnival element into what is traditionally a solemn occasion. The change was highlighted by a rock concert-style performance at the 2005 Anzac Cove commemoration during which attendees drank and slept between headstones. After the event the site was left strewn with rubbish. In 2013, historian Jonathan King said that \"escalating commercial pressures threaten to turn the centenary [of the landing at Gallipoli] into a Big Day Out\".\nDigital change has been the focus of recent concern. The centenary commemoration of Anzac and the First World War has coincided with the emergence of a mature internet and comprehensive use of social media. According to Tom Sear, a new era of \"digital commemoration\" of Anzac Day has begun. Anzac Day selfies, memes, virtual reality Anzac avatars, Facebook posts and tweeting are part of a new participative, and immersive experience of the day. Digital media have personalised the experience of Anzac Day, focusing on sharing the activities online. In a time when the line between being online and offline is increasingly blurred, there has been a turn towards commemorative activities that seek to generate empathy and connection between contemporary audiences and historical subjects through digital media. Leading news organisations such as the ABC and News Corp live tweeted and made Facebook posts about the original Anzac landings in 2015. These online forums, and their capacity for personalised feedback, have disquieted some historians, who are concerned about the distance, solemnity and critical perspective of traditional Anzac Day commemorations being lost. Equally others emphasise how, particularly young people, using these technologies of the present, play a role in connecting wider communities of Anzac Day commemorators.\nCriticism of Anzac Day.\nAt its inception, Anzac Day faced criticism from the Australian labour movement, and in the country at large, there has been opposition to political exploitation of what was seen as a day of mourning. One controversy occurred in 1960 with the publication of Alan Seymour's classic play, \"The One Day of the Year\", which dramatised the growing social divide in Australia and the questioning of old values. In the play, Anzac Day is critiqued by the central character, Hughie, as a day of drunken debauchery by returned soldiers and as a day when questions of what it means to be loyal to a nation or empire must be raised. The play was scheduled to be performed at the inaugural Adelaide Festival of Arts, but after complaints from the Returned Services League, the governors of the festival refused permission for this to occur.\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, related to Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war and other issues, Anzac Day not only sank in popularity but was the focus for the expression of much dissent. (See .)\nAnzac Day has been criticised in recent years by a number of Australians and New Zealanders, as, for example, \"a day that obscures the politics of war and discourages political dissent\". In October 2008, former Australian prime minister Paul Keating stated that he believes it is misguided for people to gather each year at Anzac Cove to commemorate the landing at Gallipoli, because it is \"utter and complete nonsense\" to suggest that the nation was \"born again or even, redeemed there\". Kevin Rudd, the Australian prime minister at the time, rejected Keating's views, saying the Gallipoli campaign is \"part of our national consciousness, it's part of our national psyche, it's part of our national identity, and I, for one, as Prime Minister of the country, am absolutely proud of it\".\nSome critics have suggested that the revival in public interest in Anzac Day amongst the young results from the fact that younger Australians have not themselves experienced war. Critics see the revival as part of a rise of unreflective nationalism in Australia which was particularly fostered by the then Australian prime minister John Howard. Some historians believe Anzac Day events are now on the decline, although it is likely there will continue to be smaller dawn services and official events in the future. Martin Crotty thought that perhaps it was now a ritual for older, traditional Australians, with old values of mateship and loyalty and even as a \"reaction against globalisation\"; however, Carolyn Holbrook disagrees, arguing that young people are responsible for the resurgence, and among older people there is a big group of sceptics, Baby Boomers who were influenced by Vietnam War protests.\nOther criticisms have revolved around a perceived overzealousness in Australian attachment to the event, either from participants unaware of the loss or when the focus is at the expense of remembrance of the contribution of New Zealand. In 2005, John Howard was criticised for shunning the New Zealand Anzac ceremony at Gallipoli, preferring instead to spend his morning at a barbecue on the beach with Australian soldiers. In 2009, New Zealand historians noted that some Australian children were unaware that New Zealand was a part of ANZAC. In 2012, a New Zealand journalist caused controversy following comments that Australian World War I soldiers were bludgers and thieves.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and emeritus professor at Princeton University. From the 1960s until his death, he was a central figure in a number of fields related to mathematical and modal logic, philosophy of language and mathematics, metaphysics, epistemology, and recursion theory.\nKripke made influential and original contributions to logic, especially modal logic. His principal contribution is a semantics for modal logic involving possible worlds, now called Kripke semantics. He received the 2001 Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy.\nKripke was also partly responsible for the revival of metaphysics and essentialism after the decline of logical positivism, claiming necessity is a metaphysical notion distinct from the epistemic notion of \"a priori\", and that there are necessary truths that are known \"a posteriori\", such as that water is H2O. A 1970 Princeton lecture series, published in book form in 1980 as \"Naming and Necessity\", is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century. It introduced the concept of names as rigid designators, designating (picking out, denoting, referring to) the same object in every possible world, as contrasted with descriptions. It also established Kripke's causal theory of reference, disputing the descriptivist theory found in Gottlob Frege's concept of sense and Bertrand Russell's theory of descriptions. Kripke is often seen in opposition to the other great late-20th-century philosopher to eschew logical positivism: W. V. O. Quine. Quine rejected essentialism and modal logic.\nKripke also gave an original reading of Ludwig Wittgenstein, known as \"Kripkenstein\", in his \"Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language\". The book contains his rule-following argument, a paradox for skepticism about meaning. Much of his work remains unpublished or exists only as tape recordings and privately circulated manuscripts.\nLife and career.\nSaul Kripke was the oldest of three children born to Dorothy K. Kripke and Myer S. Kripke. His father was the leader of Beth El Synagogue, the only Conservative congregation in Omaha, Nebraska; his mother wrote Jewish educational books for children. Saul and his two sisters, Madeline and Netta, attended Dundee Grade School and Omaha Central High School. Kripke was labeled a prodigy, teaching himself Ancient Hebrew by the age of six, reading Shakespeare's complete works by nine, and mastering the works of Descartes and complex mathematical problems before finishing elementary school. He wrote his first completeness theorem in modal logic at 17, and had it published a year later. After graduating from high school in 1958, Kripke attended Harvard University and graduated \"summa cum laude\" in 1962 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. During his sophomore year at Harvard, he taught a graduate-level logic course at nearby MIT. Upon graduation he received a Fulbright Fellowship, and in 1963 was appointed to the Society of Fellows. Kripke later said, \"I wish I could have skipped college. I got to know some interesting people but I can't say I learned anything. I probably would have learned it all anyway just reading on my own.\" His cousin is Eric Kripke, known for creating the television show \"The Boys\".\nAfter briefly teaching at Harvard, Kripke moved in 1968 to Rockefeller University in New York City, where he taught until 1976. In 1978 he took a chaired professorship at Princeton University. In 1988 he received the university's Behrman Award for distinguished achievement in the humanities. In 2002 Kripke began teaching at the CUNY Graduate Center, and in 2003 he was appointed a distinguished professor of philosophy there.\nKripke has received honorary degrees from the University of Nebraska Omaha (1977), Johns Hopkins University (1997), University of Haifa, Israel (1998), and the University of Pennsylvania (2005). He was a member of the American Philosophical Society and an elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1985 was a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. He won the Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy in 2001.\nKripke married philosopher Margaret Gilbert in 1976. They divorced in 2000.\nKripke died of pancreatic cancer on September 15, 2022, in Plainsboro, New Jersey, at the age of 81.\nWork.\nKripke's contributions to philosophy include:\nHe has also contributed to recursion theory (see admissible ordinal and Kripke\u2013Platek set theory).\nModal logic.\nTwo of Kripke's earlier works, \"A Completeness Theorem in Modal Logic\" (1959) and \"Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic\" (1963), the former written when he was a teenager, were on modal logic. The most familiar logics in the modal family are constructed from a weak logic called K, named after Kripke. Kripke introduced the now-standard Kripke semantics (also known as relational semantics or frame semantics) for modal logics. Kripke semantics is a formal semantics for non-classical logic systems. It was first made for modal logics, and later adapted to intuitionistic logic and other non-classical systems. The discovery of Kripke semantics was a breakthrough in the making of non-classical logics, because the model theory of such logics was absent before Kripke.\nA Kripke frame or modal frame is a pair formula_1, where \"W\" is a non-empty set, and \"R\" is a binary relation on \"W\". Elements of \"W\" are called \"nodes\" or \"worlds\", and \"R\" is known as the accessibility relation. Depending on the properties of the accessibility relation (transitivity, reflexivity, etc.), the corresponding frame is described, by extension, as being transitive, reflexive, etc.\nA Kripke model is a triple formula_2, where formula_1 is a Kripke frame, and formula_4 is a relation between nodes of \"W\" and modal formulas, such that:\nWe read formula_13 as \"\"w\" satisfies \"A\", \"A\" is satisfied in \"w\", or \"w\" forces \"A\"\". The relation formula_4 is called the \"satisfaction relation\", \"evaluation\", or \"forcing relation\". The satisfaction relation is uniquely determined by its value on propositional variables.\nA formula \"A\" is valid in:\nWe define Thm(\"C\") to be the set of all formulas that are valid in \"C\". Conversely, if \"X\" is a set of formulas, let Mod(\"X\") be the class of all frames which validate every formula from \"X\".\nA modal logic (i.e., a set of formulas) \"L\" is sound with respect to a class of frames \"C\", if \"L\"\u00a0\u2286\u00a0Thm(\"C\"). \"L\" is complete with respect to \"C\" if \"L\"\u00a0\u2287\u00a0Thm(\"C\").\nSemantics is useful for investigating a logic (i.e., a derivation system) only if the semantical entailment relation reflects its syntactical counterpart, the \"consequence\" relation (\"derivability\"). It is vital to know which modal logics are sound and complete with respect to a class of Kripke frames, and for them, to determine which class it is.\nFor any class \"C\" of Kripke frames, Thm(\"C\") is a normal modal logic (in particular, theorems of the minimal normal modal logic, \"K\", are valid in every Kripke model). However, the converse does not hold generally. There are Kripke incomplete normal modal logics, which is unproblematic, because most of the modal systems studied are complete of classes of frames described by simple conditions.\nA normal modal logic \"L\" corresponds to a class of frames \"C\", if \"C\"\u00a0=\u00a0Mod(\"L\"). In other words, \"C\" is the largest class of frames such that \"L\" is sound wrt \"C\". It follows that \"L\" is Kripke complete if and only if it is complete of its corresponding class.\nConsider the schema T : formula_20. T is valid in any reflexive frame formula_1: if formula_22, then formula_13 since \"w\"\u00a0\"R\"\u00a0\"w\". On the other hand, a frame which validates T has to be reflexive: fix \"w\"\u00a0\u2208\u00a0\"W\", and define satisfaction of a propositional variable \"p\" as follows: formula_24 if and only if \"w\"\u00a0\"R\"\u00a0\"u\". Then formula_25, thus formula_26 by T, which means \"w\"\u00a0\"R\"\u00a0\"w\" using the definition of formula_4. T corresponds to the class of reflexive Kripke frames.\nIt is often much easier to characterize the corresponding class of \"L\" than to prove its completeness, thus correspondence serves as a guide to completeness proofs. Correspondence is also used to show \"incompleteness\" of modal logics: suppose \"L\"1\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\"L\"2 are normal modal logics that correspond to the same class of frames, but \"L\"1 does not prove all theorems of \"L\"2. Then \"L\"1 is Kripke incomplete. For example, the schema formula_28 generates an incomplete logic, as it corresponds to the same class of frames as GL (viz. transitive and converse well-founded frames), but does not prove the GL-tautology formula_29.\nCanonical models.\nFor any normal modal logic \"L\", a Kripke model (called the canonical model) can be constructed, which validates precisely the theorems of \"L\", by an adaptation of the standard technique of using maximal consistent sets as models. Canonical Kripke models play a role similar to the Lindenbaum\u2013Tarski algebra construction in algebraic semantics.\nA set of formulas is \"L\"-\"consistent\" if no contradiction can be derived from them using the axioms of \"L\", and modus ponens. A \"maximal L-consistent set\" (an \"L\"-\"MCS\" for short) is an \"L\"-consistent set which has no proper \"L\"-consistent superset.\nThe canonical model of \"L\" is a Kripke model formula_2, where \"W\" is the set of all \"L\"-\"MCS\", and the relations \"R\" and formula_4 are as follows:\n formula_32 if and only if for every formula formula_33, if formula_34 then formula_35,\n formula_36 if and only if formula_37.\nThe canonical model is a model of \"L\", as every \"L\"-\"MCS\" contains all theorems of \"L\". By Zorn's lemma, each \"L\"-consistent set is contained in an \"L\"-\"MCS\", in particular every formula unprovable in \"L\" has a counterexample in the canonical model.\nThe main application of canonical models are completeness proofs. Properties of the canonical model of K immediately imply completeness of K with respect to the class of all Kripke frames. This argument does \"not\" work for arbitrary \"L\", because there is no guarantee that the underlying \"frame\" of the canonical model satisfies the frame conditions of \"L\".\nWe say that a formula or a set \"X\" of formulas is canonical with respect to a property \"P\" of Kripke frames, if\nA union of canonical sets of formulas is itself canonical. It follows from the preceding discussion that any logic axiomatized by a canonical set of formulas is Kripke complete, and compact.\nThe axioms T, 4, D, B, 5, H, G (and thus any combination of them) are canonical. GL and Grz are not canonical, because they are not compact. The axiom M by itself is not canonical (Goldblatt, 1991), but the combined logic S4.1 (in fact, even K4.1) is canonical.\nIn general, it is undecidable whether a given axiom is canonical. We know a nice sufficient condition: H. Sahlqvist identified a broad class of formulas (now called Sahlqvist formulas) such that:\nThis is a powerful criterion: for example, all axioms listed above as canonical are (equivalent to) Sahlqvist formulas. A logic has the finite model property (FMP) if it is complete with respect to a class of finite frames. An application of this notion is the decidability question: it follows from Post's theorem that a recursively axiomatized modal logic L which has FMP is decidable, provided it is decidable whether a given finite frame is a model of L. In particular, every finitely axiomatizable logic with FMP is decidable.\nThere are various methods for establishing FMP for a given logic. Refinements and extensions of the canonical model construction often work, using tools such as filtration or unravelling. As another possibility, completeness proofs based on cut-free sequent calculi usually produce finite models directly.\nMost of the modal systems used in practice (including all listed above) have FMP.\nIn some cases, we can use FMP to prove Kripke completeness of a logic: every normal modal logic is complete wrt a class of modal algebras, and a finite modal algebra can be transformed into a Kripke frame. As an example, Robert Bull proved using this method that every normal extension of S4.3 has FMP, and is Kripke complete.\nKripke semantics has a straightforward generalization to logics with more than one modality. A Kripke frame for a language with\nformula_38 as the set of its necessity operators consists of a non-empty set \"W\" equipped with binary relations \"Ri\" for each \"i\"\u00a0\u2208\u00a0\"I\". The definition of a satisfaction relation is modified as follows:\n formula_39 if and only if formula_40\nCarlson models.\nA simplified semantics, discovered by Tim Carlson, is often used for polymodal provability logics. A Carlson model is a structure formula_41 with a single accessibility relation \"R\", and subsets \"Di\"\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\"W\" for each modality. Satisfaction is defined as:\n formula_39 if and only if formula_43\nCarlson models are easier to visualize and to work with than usual polymodal Kripke models; there are, however, Kripke complete polymodal logics which are Carlson incomplete.\nIn \"Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic\", published in 1963, Kripke responded to a difficulty with classical quantification theory. The motivation for the world-relative approach was to represent the possibility that objects in one world may fail to exist in another. But if standard quantifier rules are used, every term must refer to something that exists in all the possible worlds. This seems incompatible with our ordinary practice of using terms to refer to things that exist contingently.\nKripke's response to this difficulty was to eliminate terms. He gave an example of a system that uses the world-relative interpretation and preserves the classical rules. But the costs are severe. First, his language is artificially impoverished, and second, the rules for the propositional modal logic must be weakened.\nKripke's possible worlds theory has been used by narratologists (beginning with Pavel and Dolezel) to understand \"reader's manipulation of alternative plot developments, or the characters' planned or fantasized alternative action series.\" This application has become especially useful in the analysis of hyperfiction.\nIntuitionistic logic.\nKripke semantics for intuitionistic logic follows the same principles as the semantics of modal logic, but uses a different definition of satisfaction.\nAn intuitionistic Kripke model is a triple\nformula_44, where formula_45 is a partially ordered Kripke frame, and formula_4 satisfies the following conditions:\nIntuitionistic logic is sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics, and it has the Finite Model Property.\nIntuitionistic first-order logic\nLet \"L\" be a first-order language. A Kripke model of \"L\" is a triple\nformula_61, where\nformula_45 is an intuitionistic Kripke frame, \"Mw\" is a\n(classical) \"L\"-structure for each node \"w\"\u00a0\u2208\u00a0\"W\", and the following compatibility conditions hold whenever \"u\"\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\"v\":\nGiven an evaluation \"e\" of variables by elements of \"Mw\", we define the satisfaction relation formula_63:\nHere \"e\"(\"x\"\u2192\"a\") is the evaluation which gives \"x\" the value \"a\", and otherwise agrees with \"e\".\n\"Naming and Necessity\".\nThe three lectures that form \"Naming and Necessity\" constitute an attack on the descriptivist theory of names. Kripke attributes variants of descriptivist theories to Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, and John Searle, among others. According to descriptivist theories, proper names either are synonymous with descriptions, or have their reference determined by virtue of the name's being associated with a description or cluster of descriptions that an object uniquely satisfies. Kripke rejects both these kinds of descriptivism. He gives several examples purporting to render descriptivism implausible as a theory of how names get their references determined (e.g., surely Aristotle could have died at age two and so not satisfied any of the descriptions we associate with his name, but it would seem wrong to deny that he was still Aristotle).\nAs an alternative, Kripke outlined a causal theory of reference, according to which a name refers to an object by virtue of a causal connection with the object as mediated through communities of speakers. He points out that proper names, in contrast to most descriptions, are rigid designators: that is, a proper name refers to the named object in every possible world in which the object exists, while most descriptions designate different objects in different possible worlds. For example, \"Richard Nixon\" refers to the same person in every possible world in which Nixon exists, while \"the person who won the United States presidential election of 1968\" could refer to Nixon, Humphrey, or others in different possible worlds.\nKripke also raised the prospect of \"a posteriori necessities\"\u2014facts that are necessarily true, though they can be known only through empirical investigation. Examples include \"Hesperus is Phosphorus\", \"Cicero is Tully\", \"Water is H2O\", and other identity claims where two names refer to the same object. According to Kripke, the Kantian distinctions between analytic and synthetic, \"a priori\" and \"a posteriori\", and contingent and necessary do not map onto one another. Rather, analytic/synthetic is a semantic distinction, \"a priori\"/\"a posteriori\" is an epistemic distinction, and contingent/necessary is a metaphysical distinction.\nFinally, Kripke gave an argument against identity materialism in the philosophy of mind, the view that every mental particular is identical with some physical particular. Kripke argued that the only way to defend this identity is as an \"a posteriori\" necessary identity, but that such an identity\u2014e.g., that pain is C-fibers firing\u2014could not be necessary, given the (clearly conceivable) possibility that pain could be separate from the firing of C-fibers, or the firing of C-fibers be separate from pain. (Similar arguments have since been made by David Chalmers.) In any event, the psychophysical identity theorist, according to Kripke, incurs a dialectical obligation to explain the apparent logical possibility of these circumstances, since according to such theorists they should be impossible.\nKripke delivered the John Locke Lectures in philosophy at Oxford in 1973. Titled \"Reference and Existence\", they were in many respects a continuation of \"Naming and Necessity\", and deal with the subjects of fictional names and perceptual error. In 2013 Oxford University Press published the lectures as a book, also titled \"Reference and Existence\".\nIn a 1995 paper, philosopher Quentin Smith argued that key concepts in Kripke's new theory of reference originated in the work of Ruth Barcan Marcus more than a decade earlier. Smith identified six significant ideas in the New Theory that he claimed Marcus had developed: (1) that proper names are direct references that do not consist of contained definitions; (2) that while one can single out a single thing by a description, this description is not equivalent to a proper name of this thing; (3) the modal argument that proper names are directly referential, and not disguised descriptions; (4) a formal modal logic proof of the necessity of identity; (5) the concept of a rigid designator, though Kripke coined that term; and (6) \"a posteriori\" identity. Smith argued that Kripke failed to understand Marcus's theory at the time but later adopted many of its key conceptual themes in his New Theory of Reference.\nOther scholars have subsequently offered detailed responses arguing that no plagiarism occurred.\n\"A Puzzle about Belief\".\nIn \"Naming and Necessity\", Kripke argues for direct reference theory (that the meaning of a name is simply the object it refers to). Nevertheless, he acknowledges the possibility that propositions containing names may have some additional semantic properties, properties that could explain why two names referring to the same person may give different truth values in propositions about beliefs. For example, Lois Lane believes that Superman can fly, although she does not believe that Clark Kent can fly. According to the mediated reference theory of names, this is explained by the fact that the names \"Superman\" and \"Clark Kent\", though referring to the same person, have distinct semantic properties.\nBut in his article \"A Puzzle about Belief\" (1988) Kripke seems to oppose even this possibility. His argument can be reconstructed as follows: The idea that two names referring to the same object may have different semantic properties is supposed to explain the fact that the intersubstitution of coreferring names in propositions about beliefs can alter truth value (as in Lois Lane's case). But the same phenomenon occurs even without the intersubstitution of coreferring names: Kripke invites us to imagine a French, monolingual boy, Pierre, who believes the proposition expressed by \"Londres est jolie\" (\"London is beautiful\"). Pierre moves to London without realizing that London = Londres. He then learns English the same way a child would learn the language, that is, not by translating words from French to English. Pierre learns the name \"London\" from the unattractive part of the city where he lives, and so comes to believe that London is not beautiful. Pierre will now assent to the sentences \"Londres est jolie\" and \"London is not beautiful\". With only translation and disquotation, the puzzle can be generated: Pierre both believes that London is pretty and doesn't believe that London is pretty. This paradox arises without making use of intersubstitution of coreferring names. Kripke shows later in the article how this puzzle can be generated \"within a single language\", using only disquotation. The upshot of this, according to Kripke, is that intersubstitution of coreferring names cannot be blamed for the difficulty created by belief contexts. If this is right, contra proponents of mediated reference theory, the inconsistency of belief contexts involving coreferring names cannot be taken as evidence against his direct reference theory of names.\nWittgenstein.\nFirst published in 1982, Kripke's \"Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language\" contends that the central argument of Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\" centers on a devastating rule-following paradox that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language. Kripke writes that this paradox is \"the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date\", and that Wittgenstein does not reject the argument that leads to the rule-following paradox, but accepts it and offers a \"skeptical solution\" to ameliorate the paradox's destructive effects.\nMost commentators accept that \"Philosophical Investigations\" contains the rule-following paradox as Kripke presents it, but few have agreed with his attributing a skeptical solution to Wittgenstein. Kripke himself expresses doubts in \"Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language\" as to whether Wittgenstein would endorse his interpretation of \"Philosophical Investigations.\" He says that the work should not be read as an attempt to give an accurate statement of Wittgenstein's views, but rather as an account of Wittgenstein's argument \"as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him\".\nThe portmanteau \"Kripkenstein\" has been coined for Kripke's interpretation of \"Philosophical Investigations\". Kripkenstein's main significance was a clear statement of a new kind of skepticism, dubbed \"meaning skepticism\": the idea that for isolated individuals there is no fact in virtue of which they mean one thing rather than another by the use of a word. Kripke's \"skeptical solution\" to meaning skepticism is to ground meaning in the behavior of a community.\nKripke's book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his skeptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as Gordon Baker, Peter Hacker, and Colin McGinn, who argue that his meaning skepticism is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke's position has been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher Martin Kusch, and Wittgenstein scholar David G. Stern considers Kripke's book \"the most influential and widely discussed\" work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.\nTruth.\nIn his 1975 article \"Outline of a Theory of Truth\", Kripke showed that a language can consistently contain its own truth predicate, something deemed impossible by Alfred Tarski, a pioneer in formal theories of truth. The approach involves letting truth be a partially defined property over the set of grammatically well-formed sentences in the language. Kripke showed how to do this recursively by starting from the set of expressions in a language that do not contain the truth predicate, and defining a truth predicate over just that segment: this action adds new sentences to the language, and truth is in turn defined for all of them. Unlike Tarski's approach, however, Kripke's lets \"truth\" be the union of all of these definition-stages; after a denumerable infinity of steps the language reaches a \"fixed point\" such that using Kripke's method to expand the truth-predicate does not change the language any further. Such a fixed point can then be taken as the basic form of a natural language containing its own truth predicate. But this predicate is undefined for any sentences that do not, so to speak, \"bottom out\" in simpler sentences not containing a truth predicate. That is, \" 'Snow is white' is true\" is well-defined, as is \" ' \"Snow is white\" is true' is true,\" and so forth, but neither \"This sentence is true\" nor \"This sentence is not true\" receive truth-conditions; they are, in Kripke's terms, \"ungrounded.\"\nG\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem demonstrates that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects (such as integers) can have an informal self-referential meaning, and this idea \u2013 manifested by the diagonal lemma \u2013 is the basis for Tarski's theorem that truth cannot be consistently defined. But Kripke's truth predicate does not give a truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, since it is provable by induction that it is undefined at stage formula_84 for every finite formula_84.\nKripke's proposal is problematic in the sense that while the language contains a \"truth\" predicate of itself (at least a partial one), some of its sentences \u2013 such as the liar sentence (\"this sentence is false\") \u2013 have an undefined truth value, but the language does not contain its own \"undefined\" predicate. In fact it cannot, as that would create a new version of the liar paradox, the \"strengthened liar paradox\" (\"this sentence is false or undefined\"). Thus while the liar sentence is undefined in the language, the language cannot express that it is undefined.\nSaul Kripke Center.\nThe mission of the Saul Kripke Center at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York is to preserve and to promote Kripke's work. Its director is Yale Weiss. The Saul Kripke Center holds events related to Kripke's work and is creating a digital archive of previously unpublished recordings of his lectures, lecture notes, and correspondence dating to the 1950s. In his review of Kripke's \"Philosophical Troubles\", philosopher Mark Crimmins wrote, \"That four of the most admired and discussed essays in 1970s philosophy are here is enough to make this first volume of Saul Kripke's collected articles a must-have... The reader's delight will grow as hints are dropped that there is a great deal more to come in this series being prepared by Kripke and an ace team of philosopher-editors at the Saul Kripke Center at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48041", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48041", "title": "Relativism", "text": "Philosophical view rejecting objectivity\nRelativism is a family of philosophical views which deny claims to absolute objectivity within a particular domain and assert that valuations in that domain are relative to the perspective of an observer or the context in which they are assessed.\nThere are many different forms of relativism, with a great deal of variation in scope and differing degrees of controversy among them. \"Moral relativism\" encompasses the differences in moral judgments among people and cultures. \"Epistemic relativism\" holds that there are no absolute principles regarding normative belief, justification, or rationality, and that there are only relative ones. \"Alethic relativism\" (also factual relativism) is the doctrine that there are no absolute truths, i.e., that truth is always relative to some particular frame of reference, such as a language or a culture (cultural relativism), while linguistic relativism asserts that a language's structures influence a speaker's perceptions. Some forms of relativism also bear a resemblance to philosophical skepticism. \"Descriptive relativism\" seeks to describe the differences among cultures and people without evaluation, while normative relativism evaluates the word truthfulness of views within a given framework.\nForms.\nAnthropological versus philosophical relativism.\nAnthropological relativism refers to a methodological stance, in which the researcher suspends (or brackets) their own cultural prejudice while trying to understand beliefs or behaviors in their contexts. This has become known as methodological relativism, and concerns itself specifically with avoiding ethnocentrism or the application of one's own cultural standards to the assessment of other cultures. This is also the basis of the so-called \"emic\" and \"etic\" distinction, in which:\nPhilosophical relativism, in contrast, asserts that the truth of a proposition depends on the metaphysical, or theoretical frame, or the instrumental method, or the context in which the proposition is expressed, or on the person, groups, or culture who interpret the proposition.\nMethodological relativism and philosophical relativism can exist independently from one another, but most anthropologists base their methodological relativism on that of the philosophical variety.\nDescriptive versus normative relativism.\nThe concept of relativism also has importance both for philosophers and for anthropologists in another way. In general, anthropologists engage in descriptive relativism (\"how things are\" or \"how things seem\"), whereas philosophers engage in normative relativism (\"how things ought to be\"), although there is some overlap (for example, descriptive relativism can pertain to concepts, normative relativism to truth).\nDescriptive relativism assumes that certain cultural groups have different modes of thought, standards of reasoning, and so forth, and it is the anthropologist's task to describe, but not to evaluate the validity of these principles and practices of a cultural group. It is possible for an anthropologist in his or her fieldwork to be a descriptive relativist about some things that typically concern the philosopher (e.g., ethical principles) but not about others (e.g., logical principles). However, the descriptive relativist's empirical claims about epistemic principles, moral ideals and the like are often countered by anthropological arguments that such things are universal, and much of the recent literature on these matters is explicitly concerned with the extent of, and evidence for, cultural or moral or linguistic or human universals.\nThe fact that the various species of descriptive relativism are empirical claims may tempt the philosopher to conclude that they are of little philosophical interest, but there are several reasons why this is not so. First, some philosophers, notably Kant, argue that certain sorts of cognitive differences between human beings (or even all rational beings) are impossible, so such differences could never be found to obtain in fact, an argument that places a priori limits on what empirical inquiry could discover and on what versions of descriptive relativism could be true. Second, claims about actual differences between groups play a central role in some arguments for normative relativism (for example, arguments for normative ethical relativism often begin with claims that different groups in fact have different moral codes or ideals). Finally, the anthropologist's descriptive account of relativism helps to separate the fixed aspects of human nature from those that can vary, and so a descriptive claim that some important aspect of experience or thought does (or does not) vary across groups of human beings tells us something important about human nature and the human condition.\nNormative relativism concerns normative or evaluative claims that modes of thought, standards of reasoning, or the like are only right or wrong relative to a framework. 'Normative' is meant in a general sense, applying to a wide range of views; in the case of beliefs, for example, normative correctness equals truth. This does not mean, of course, that framework-relative correctness or truth is always clear, the first challenge being to explain what it amounts to in any given case (e.g., with respect to concepts, truth, epistemic norms). Normative relativism (say, in regard to normative ethical relativism) therefore implies that things (say, ethical claims) are not simply true in themselves, but only have truth values relative to broader frameworks (say, moral codes). (Many normative ethical relativist arguments run from premises about ethics to conclusions that assert the relativity of truth values, bypassing general claims about the nature of truth, but it is often more illuminating to consider the type of relativism under question directly.)\nLegal relativism.\nIn English common law, two (perhaps three) separate standards of proof are recognized:\nRelated and contrasting positions.\nRelationism is the theory that there are only relations between individual entities, and no intrinsic\nproperties. Despite the similarity in name, it is held by some to be a position distinct from relativism\u2014for instance, because \"statements about relational properties [...] assert an absolute truth about things in the world\".\nOn the other hand, others wish to equate relativism, relationism and even relativity, which is a precise theory of relationships between physical objects: Nevertheless, \"This confluence of relativity theory with relativism became a strong contributing factor in the increasing prominence of relativism\".\nWhereas previous investigations of science only sought sociological or psychological explanations of failed scientific theories or pathological science, the 'strong programme' is more relativistic, assessing scientific truth and falsehood equally in a historic and cultural context.\nCriticisms.\nA common argument against relativism suggests that it inherently refutes itself: the statement \"all is relative\" classes either as a relative statement or as an absolute one. If it is relative, then this statement does not rule out absolutes. If the statement is absolute, on the other hand, then it provides an example of an absolute statement, proving that not all truths are relative. However, this argument against relativism only applies to relativism that positions truth as relative\u2013i.e. epistemological/truth-value relativism. More specifically, it is only extreme forms of epistemological relativism that can come in for this criticism as there are many epistemological relativists who posit that some aspects of what is regarded as factually \"true\" are not universal, yet still accept that other universal truths exist (e.g. gas laws or moral laws).\nAnother argument against relativism posits the existence of natural law. Simply put, the physical universe works under basic principles: the \"Laws of Nature\". Some contend that a natural moral law may also exist, for example as argued by, Immanuel Kant in \"Critique of Practical Reason\", Richard Dawkins in \"The God Delusion\" (2006) and addressed by C. S. Lewis in \"Mere Christianity\" (1952). Dawkins said \"I think we face an equal but much more sinister challenge from the left, in the shape of cultural relativism - the view that scientific truth is only one kind of truth and it is not to be especially privileged\".\nPhilosopher Hilary Putnam, among others, states that some forms of relativism make it impossible to believe one is in error. If there is no truth beyond an individual's belief that something is true, then an individual cannot hold their own beliefs to be false or mistaken. A related criticism is that relativizing truth to individuals destroys the distinction between truth and belief.\nPhilosopher Donald Davidson presented an influential critique of conceptual relativism in his 1974 essay \"On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme\". Conceptual relativism is the idea that different people or even entire communities could make sense of the world in radically different, incommensurable (meaning untranslatable) ways. One of the consequences of this idea is that truth is relative to one's way of thinking rather than objective. Davidson attacks what he believes to be the entire framework which makes conceptual relativism intelligible, namely scheme\u2013content dualism, which is the idea that all knowledge is the result of one's scheme of concepts being imposed upon empirical content from the world. In refuting scheme\u2013content dualism, Davidson shows that knowledge of one's scheme of concepts is necessarily inseparable from one's knowledge of the world, and so translation between different people or communities is always possible in principle.\nAccording to Belgian philosopher of science Maarten Boudry, relativism is rarely applied consistently. In an opinion piece, he argues that no one truly acts according to the belief that truth is relative. Even self-proclaimed relativists, he suggests, do not genuinely believe their own slogans and catchphrases. They become indignant when falsely accused of a crime and laugh at those who claim the Earth is flat. Boudry contends that people abandon their relativism when it really matters\u2014for instance, when visiting a doctor for cancer screening or boarding a plane, trusting in the laws of physics. He argues that relativism about truth is not so much a sincere conviction as it is an empty slogan or a convenient rhetorical device people deploy when it suits them. Boudry refers to this phenomenon as \u201coccasional relativism,\u201d highlighting what he sees as the casual and opportunistic nature of such relativist claims.\nViews.\nPhilosophical.\nAncient.\nSophism.\nSophists are considered the founding fathers of relativism in Western philosophy. Elements of relativism emerged among the Sophists in the 5th century BC. Notably, it was Protagoras who coined the phrase, \"Man is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not.\" The thinking of the Sophists is mainly known through their opponent, Plato. In a paraphrase from Plato's dialogue \"Theaetetus\", Protagoras said: \"What is true for you is true for you, and what is true for me is true for me.\"\nModern.\nBernard Crick.\nBernard Crick, a British political scientist and advocate of relativism, suggested in \"In Defence of Politics\" (1962) that moral conflict between people is inevitable. He thought that only ethics can resolve such conflict, and when that occurs in public it results in politics. Accordingly, Crick saw the process of dispute resolution, harms reduction, mediation or peacemaking as central to all of moral philosophy. He became an important influence on feminists and later on the Greens.\nPaul Feyerabend.\nPhilosopher of science Paul Feyerabend is often considered to be a relativist, although he denied being one.\nFeyerabend argued that modern science suffers from being methodologically monistic (the belief that only a single methodology can produce scientific progress). Feyerabend summarises his case in \"Against Method\" with the phrase \"anything goes\".\nIn an aphorism [Feyerabend] often repeated, \"potentially every culture is all cultures\". This is intended to convey that world views are not hermetically closed, since their leading concepts have an \"ambiguity\" - better, an open-endedness - which enables people from other cultures to engage with them. [...] It follows that relativism, understood as the doctrine that truth is relative to closed systems, can get no purchase. [...] For Feyerabend, both hermetic relativism and its absolutist rival [realism] serve, in their different ways, to \"devalue human existence\". The former encourages that unsavoury brand of political correctness which takes the refusal to criticise \"other cultures\" to the extreme of condoning murderous dictatorship and barbaric practices. The latter, especially in its favoured contemporary form of \"scientific realism\", with the excessive prestige it affords to the abstractions of \"the monster 'science'\", is in bed with a politics which likewise disdains variety, richness and everyday individuality - a politics which likewise \"hides\" its norms behind allegedly neutral facts, \"blunts choices and imposes laws\".\nThomas Kuhn.\nThomas Kuhn's philosophy of science, as expressed in \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", is often interpreted as relativistic. He claimed that, as well as progressing steadily and incrementally (\"normal science\"), science undergoes periodic revolutions or \"paradigm shifts\", leaving scientists working in different paradigms with difficulty in even communicating. Thus the truth of a claim, or the existence of a posited entity, is relative to the paradigm employed. However, it is not necessary for him to embrace relativism because every paradigm presupposes the prior, building upon itself through history and so on. This leads to there being a fundamental, incremental, and referential structure of development which is not relative but again, fundamental.\nFrom these remarks, one thing is however certain: Kuhn is not saying that incommensurable theories cannot be compared - what they can't be is compared in terms of a system of common measure. He very plainly says that they can be compared, and he reiterates this repeatedly in later work, in a (mostly in vain) effort to avert the crude and sometimes catastrophic misinterpretations he suffered from mainstream philosophers and post-modern relativists alike.\nBut Kuhn rejected the accusation of being a relativist later in his postscript:\nscientific development is ... a unidirectional and irreversible process. Later scientific theories are better than earlier ones for solving puzzles ... That is not a relativist's position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress.\nSome have argued that one can also read Kuhn's work as essentially positivist in its ontology: the revolutions he posits are epistemological, lurching toward a presumably 'better' understanding of an objective reality through the lens presented by the new paradigm. However, a number of passages in \"Structure\" do indeed appear to be distinctly relativist, and to directly challenge the notion of an objective reality and the ability of science to progress towards an ever-greater grasp of it, particularly through the process of paradigm change.\nIn the sciences there need not be progress of another sort. We may, to be more precise, have to relinquish the notion, explicit or implicit, that changes of paradigm carry scientists and those who learn from them closer and closer to the truth.\nWe are all deeply accustomed to seeing science as the one enterprise that draws constantly nearer to some goal set by nature in advance. But need there be any such goal? Can we not account for both science's existence and its success in terms of evolution from the community's state of knowledge at any given time? Does it really help to imagine that there is some one full, objective, true account of nature and that the proper measure of scientific achievement is the extent to which it brings us closer to that ultimate goal?\nGeorge Lakoff and Mark Johnson.\nGeorge Lakoff and Mark Johnson define relativism in \"Metaphors We Live By\" as the rejection of both subjectivism and metaphysical objectivism in order to focus on the relationship between them, i.e. the metaphor by which we relate our current experience to our previous experience. In particular, Lakoff and Johnson characterize \"objectivism\" as a \"straw man\", and, to a lesser degree, criticize the views of Karl Popper, Kant and Aristotle.\nRobert Nozick.\nIn his book \"Invariances\", Robert Nozick expresses a complex set of theories about the absolute and the relative. He thinks the absolute/relative distinction should be recast in terms of an invariant/variant distinction, where there are many things a proposition can be invariant with regard to or vary with. He thinks it is coherent for truth to be relative, and speculates that it might vary with time. He thinks necessity is an unobtainable notion, but can be approximated by robust invariance across a variety of conditions\u2014although we can never identify a proposition that is invariant with regard to everything. Finally, he is not particularly warm to one of the most famous forms of relativism, moral relativism, preferring an evolutionary account.\nJoseph Margolis.\nJoseph Margolis advocates a view he calls \"robust relativism\" and defends it in his books \"Historied Thought, Constructed World\", Chapter 4 (California, 1995) and \"The Truth about Relativism\" (Blackwell, 1991). He opens his account by stating that our logics should depend on what we take to be the nature of the sphere to which we wish to apply our logics. Holding that there can be no distinctions which are not \"privileged\" between the alethic, the ontic, and the epistemic, he maintains that a many-valued logic just might be the most apt for aesthetics or history since, because in these practices, we are loath to hold to simple binary logic; and he also holds that many-valued logic is relativistic. (This is perhaps an unusual definition of \"relativistic\". Compare with his comments on \"relationism\".) To say that \"True\" and \"False\" are mutually exclusive and exhaustive judgements on \"Hamlet\", for instance, really does seem absurd. A many-valued logic\u2014with its values \"apt\", \"reasonable\", \"likely\", and so on\u2014seems intuitively more applicable to interpreting \"Hamlet\". Where apparent contradictions arise between such interpretations, we might call the interpretations \"incongruent\", rather than dubbing either of them \"false\", because using many-valued logic implies that a measured value is a mixture of two extreme possibilities. Using the subset of many-valued logic, fuzzy logic, it can be said that various interpretations can be represented by membership in more than one possible truth set simultaneously. Fuzzy logic is therefore probably the best mathematical structure for understanding \"robust relativism\" and has been interpreted by Bart Kosko as philosophically being related to Zen Buddhism.\nIt was Aristotle who held that relativism implies that we should, sticking with appearances only, end up contradicting ourselves somewhere if we could apply all attributes to all \"ousiai\" (beings). Aristotle, however, made non-contradiction dependent upon his essentialism. If his essentialism is false, then so too is his ground for disallowing relativism. (Subsequent philosophers have found other reasons for supporting the principle of non-contradiction.)\nBeginning with Protagoras and invoking Charles Sanders Peirce, Margolis shows that the historic struggle to discredit relativism is an attempt to impose an unexamined belief in the world's essentially rigid rule-like nature. Plato and Aristotle merely attacked \"relationalism\"\u2014the doctrine of true for l or true for k, and the like, where l and k are different speakers or different worlds\u2014or something similar (most philosophers would call this position \"relativism\"). For Margolis, \"true\" means true; that is, the alethic use of \"true\" remains untouched. However, in real world contexts, and context is ubiquitous in the real world, we must apply truth values. Here, in epistemic terms, we might \"tout court\" retire \"true\" as an evaluation and keep \"false\". The rest of our value-judgements could be graded from \"extremely plausible\" down to \"false\". Judgements which on a bivalent logic would be incompatible or contradictory are further seen as \"incongruent\", although one may well have more weight than the other. In short, relativistic logic is not, or need not be, the bugbear it is often presented to be. It may simply be the best type of logic to apply to certain very uncertain spheres of real experiences in the world (although some sort of logic needs to be applied in order to make that judgement). Those who swear by bivalent logic might simply be the ultimate keepers of the great fear of the flux.\nRichard Rorty.\nPhilosopher Richard Rorty has a somewhat paradoxical role in the debate over relativism: he is criticized for his relativistic views by many commentators, but has always denied that relativism applies to much anybody, being nothing more than a Platonic scarecrow. Rorty claims, rather, that he is a pragmatist, and that to construe pragmatism as relativism is to beg the question.\n'\"Relativism\" is the traditional epithet applied to pragmatism by realists'\n'\"Relativism\" is the view that every belief on a certain topic, or perhaps about any topic, is as good as every other. No one holds this view. Except for the occasional cooperative freshman, one cannot find anybody who says that two incompatible opinions on an important topic are equally good. The philosophers who get called 'relativists' are those who say that the grounds for choosing between such opinions are less algorithmic than had been thought.'\n'In short, my strategy for escaping the self-referential difficulties into which \"the Relativist\" keeps getting himself is to move everything over from epistemology and metaphysics into cultural politics, from claims to knowledge and appeals to self-evidence to suggestions about what we should try.'\nRorty takes a deflationary attitude to truth, believing there is nothing of interest to be said about truth in general, including the contention that it is generally subjective. He also argues that the notion of warrant or justification can do most of the work traditionally assigned to the concept of truth, and that justification \"is\" relative; justification is justification to an audience, for Rorty.\nIn \"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity\" he argues that the debate between so-called relativists and so-called objectivists is beside the point because they do not have enough premises in common for either side to prove anything to the other.\nNalin de Silva.\nIn his book \"Mage Lokaya\" (My World), 1986, Nalin de Silva criticized the basis of the established western system of knowledge, and its propagation, which he refers as \"domination throughout the world\".He explained in this book that mind independent reality is impossible and knowledge is not found but constructed. Further he has introduced and developed the concept of \"Constructive Relativism\" as the basis on which knowledge is constructed relative to the sense organs, culture and the mind completely based on Avidya.\nPostmodernism.\nThe term \"relativism\" often comes up in debates over postmodernism, poststructuralism and phenomenology. Critics of these perspectives often identify advocates with the label \"relativism\". For example, the Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis is often considered a relativist view because it posits that linguistic categories and structures shape the way people view the world. Stanley Fish has defended postmodernism and relativism.\nThese perspectives do not strictly count as relativist in the philosophical sense, because they express agnosticism on the nature of reality and make epistemological rather than ontological claims. Nevertheless, the term is useful to differentiate them from realists who believe that the purpose of philosophy, science, or literary critique is to locate externally true meanings. Important philosophers and theorists such as Michel Foucault, Max Stirner, political movements such as post-anarchism or post-Marxism can also be considered as relativist in this sense - though a better term might be social constructivist.\nThe spread and popularity of this kind of \"soft\" relativism varies between academic disciplines. It has wide support in anthropology and has a majority following in cultural studies. It also has advocates in political theory and political science, sociology, and continental philosophy (as distinct from Anglo-American analytical philosophy). It has inspired empirical studies of the social construction of meaning such as those associated with labelling theory, which defenders can point to as evidence of the validity of their theories (albeit risking accusations of performative contradiction in the process). Advocates of this kind of relativism often also claim that recent developments in the natural sciences, such as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, quantum mechanics, chaos theory and complexity theory show that science is now becoming relativistic. However, many scientists who use these methods continue to identify as realist or post-positivist, and some sharply criticize the association.\nReligious.\nBuddhism.\nMadhyamaka Buddhism, which forms the basis for many Mahayana Buddhist schools and which was founded by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna taught the idea of relativity. In the Ratn\u0101val\u012b, he gives the example that shortness exists only in relation to the idea of length. The determination of a thing or object is only possible in relation to other things or objects, especially by way of contrast. He held that the relationship between the ideas of \"short\" and \"long\" is not due to intrinsic nature (svabh\u0101va). This idea is also found in the Pali Nik\u0101yas and Chinese \u0100gamas, in which the idea of relativity is expressed similarly: \"That which is the element of light ... is seen to exist on account of [in relation to] darkness; that which is the element of good is seen to exist on account of bad; that which is the element of space is seen to exist on account of form.\"\nMadhyamaka Buddhism discerns two levels of truth: relative and ultimate. The two truths doctrine states that there are \"Relative\" or conventional, common-sense truth, which describes our daily experience of a concrete world, and \"Ultimate\" truth, which describes the ultimate reality as \"sunyata\", empty of concrete and inherent characteristics. Conventional truth may be understood, in contrast, as \"obscurative truth\" or \"that which obscures the true nature\". It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truth is the phenomenal world free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.\nCatholicism.\nThe Catholic Church, especially under John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, has identified relativism as one of the most significant problems for faith and morals today.\nAccording to the Church and to some theologians, relativism, as a denial of absolute truth, leads to moral license and a denial of the possibility of sin and of God. Whether moral or epistemological, relativism constitutes a denial of the capacity of the human mind and reason to arrive at truth. Truth, according to Catholic theologians and philosophers (following Aristotle) consists of \"adequatio rei et intellectus\", the correspondence of the mind and reality. Another way of putting it states that the mind has the same form as reality. This means when the form of the computer in front of someone (the type, color, shape, capacity, etc.) is also the form that is in their mind, then what they know is true because their mind corresponds to objective reality.\nThe denial of an absolute reference, of an \"axis mundi\", denies God, who equates to Absolute Truth, according to these Christian theologians. They link relativism to secularism, an obstruction of religion in human life.\nLeo XIII.\nPope Leo XIII (1810\u20131903) was the first known Pope to use the word \"relativism\", in his encyclical \"Humanum genus\" (1884). Leo condemned Freemasonry and claimed that its philosophical and political system was largely based on relativism.\nJohn Paul II.\nJohn Paul II wrote in \"Veritatis Splendor\"\nAs is immediately evident, the crisis of truth is not unconnected with this development. Once the idea of a universal truth about the good, knowable by human reason, is lost, inevitably the notion of conscience also changes. Conscience is no longer considered in its primordial reality as an act of a person's intelligence, the function of which is to apply the universal knowledge of the good in a specific situation and thus to express a judgment about the right conduct to be chosen here and now. Instead, there is a tendency to grant to the individual conscience the prerogative of independently determining the criteria of good and evil and then acting accordingly. Such an outlook is quite congenial to an individualist ethic, wherein each individual is faced with his own truth, different from the truth of others. Taken to its extreme consequences, this individualism leads to a denial of the very idea of human nature.\nIn \"Evangelium Vitae\" (The Gospel of Life), he says:\nFreedom negates and destroys itself, and becomes a factor leading to the destruction of others, when it no longer recognizes and respects its essential link with the truth. When freedom, out of a desire to emancipate itself from all forms of tradition and authority, shuts out even the most obvious evidence of an objective and universal truth, which is the foundation of personal and social life, then the person ends up by no longer taking as the sole and indisputable point of reference for his own choices the truth about good and evil, but only his subjective and changeable opinion or, indeed, his selfish interest and whim.\nBenedict XVI.\nIn April 2005, in his homily during Mass prior to the conclave which would elect him as Pope, then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger talked about the world \"moving towards a dictatorship of relativism\":\nHow many winds of doctrine we have known in recent decades, how many ideological currents, how many ways of thinking. The small boat of thought of many Christians has often been tossed about by these waves \u2013 thrown from one extreme to the other: from Marxism to liberalism, even to libertinism; from collectivism to radical individualism; from atheism to a vague religious mysticism; from agnosticism to syncretism, and so forth. Every day new sects are created and what Saint Paul says about human trickery comes true, with cunning which tries to draw those into error (cf Ephesians 4, 14). Having a clear Faith, based on the Creed of the Church, is often labeled today as a fundamentalism. Whereas, relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and \"swept along by every wind of teaching\", looks like the only attitude acceptable to today's standards. We are moving towards a dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as certain and which has as its highest goal one's own ego and one's own desires. However, we have a different goal: the Son of God, true man. He is the measure of true humanism. Being an \"Adult\" means having a faith which does not follow the waves of today's fashions or the latest novelties. A faith which is deeply rooted in friendship with Christ is adult and mature. It is this friendship which opens us up to all that is good and gives us the knowledge to judge true from false, and deceit from truth.\nOn June 6, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI told educators:\nToday, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that relativism which, recognizing nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom it becomes a prison for each one, for it separates people from one another, locking each person into his or her own 'ego'.\nThen during the World Youth Day in August 2005, he also traced to relativism the problems produced by the communist and sexual revolutions, and provided a counter-counter argument.\nIn the last century we experienced revolutions with a common programme\u2013expecting nothing more from God, they assumed total responsibility for the cause of the world in order to change it. And this, as we saw, meant that a human and partial point of view was always taken as an absolute guiding principle. Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism. It does not liberate man, but takes away his dignity and enslaves him. It is not ideologies that save the world, but only a return to the living God, our Creator, the Guarantor of our freedom, the Guarantor of what is really good and true.\nPope Francis.\nPope Francis refers in \"Evangelii gaudium\" to two forms of relativism, \"doctrinal relativism\" and a \"practical relativism\" typical of \"our age\", noting that pastoral workers who believe in the ideals of the Church may still fall into a form of relativism based on a lack of enthusiasm for social participation and focus on individualism.\nPastoral workers can thus fall into a relativism which, whatever their particular style of spirituality or way of thinking, proves even more dangerous than doctrinal relativism. It has to do with the deepest and inmost decisions that shape their way of life. This practical relativism consists in acting as if God did not exist, making decisions as if the poor did not exist, setting goals as if others did not exist, working as if people who have not received the Gospel did not exist. It is striking that even some who clearly have solid doctrinal and spiritual convictions frequently fall into a lifestyle which leads to an attachment to financial security, or to a desire for power or human glory at all cost, rather than giving their lives to others in mission.\nJainism.\nMahavira (599-527 BC), the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, developed a philosophy known as Anekantavada. John Koller describes \"anek\u0101ntav\u0101da\" as \"epistemological respect for view of others\" about the nature of existence, whether it is \"inherently enduring or constantly changing\", but \"not relativism; it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal\".\nSikhism.\nIn Sikhism the Gurus (spiritual teachers) have propagated the message of \"many paths\" leading to the one God and ultimate salvation for all souls who tread on the path of righteousness. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths can, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the Lord, certainly achieve salvation. The students of the Sikh faith are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. The holy book of the Sikhs called the Sri Guru Granth Sahib says: \"Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.\" Guru Granth Sahib page 1350; later stating: \"The seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months, and the various seasons originate from the one Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator.\" Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The routing table contains information about the topology of the network immediately around it.\nThe construction of routing tables is the primary goal of routing protocols. Static routes are entries that are fixed, rather than resulting from routing protocols and network topology discovery procedures.\nOverview.\nA routing table is analogous to a distribution map in package delivery. Whenever a node needs to send data to another node on a network, it must first know \"where\" to send it. If the node cannot directly connect to the destination node, it has to send it via other nodes along a route to the destination node. Each node needs to keep track of which way to deliver various packages of data, and for this it uses a routing table. A routing table is a database that keeps track of paths, like a map, and uses these to determine which way to forward traffic. A routing table is a data file in RAM that is used to store route information about directly connected and remote networks. Nodes can also share the contents of their routing table with other nodes.\nThe primary function of a router is to forward a packet toward its destination network, which is the destination IP address of the packet. To do this, a router needs to search the routing information stored in its routing table. The routing table contains network/next hop associations. These associations tell a router that a particular destination can be optimally reached by sending the packet to a specific router that represents the next hop on the way to the final destination. The next hop association can also be the outgoing or exit interface to the final destination.\nWith hop-by-hop routing, each routing table lists, for all reachable destinations, the address of the next device along the path to that destination: the next hop. Assuming that the routing tables are consistent, the simple algorithm of relaying packets to their destination's next hop thus suffices to deliver data anywhere in a network. Hop-by-hop is the fundamental characteristic of the IP Internet layer and the OSI Network Layer.\nWhen a router interface is configured with an IP address and subnet mask, the interface becomes a host on that attached network. A directly connected network is a network that is directly attached to one of the router interfaces. The network address and subnet mask of the interface, along with the interface type and number, are entered into the routing table as a directly connected network.\nA remote network is a network that can only be reached by sending the packet to another router. Routing table entries to remote networks may be either dynamic or static. Dynamic routes are routes to remote networks that were learned automatically by the router through a dynamic routing protocol. Static routes are routes that a network administrator manually configured.\nRouting tables are also a key aspect of certain security operations, such as unicast reverse path forwarding (uRPF). In this technique, which has several variants, the router also looks up, in the routing table, the \"source address\" of the packet. If there exists no route back to the source address, the packet is assumed to be malformed or involved in a network attack and is dropped.\nDifficulties.\nThe need to record routes to large numbers of devices using limited storage space represents a major challenge in routing table construction. In the Internet, the currently dominant address aggregation technology is a bitwise prefix matching scheme called Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). Supernetworks can also be used to help control routing table size.\nContents.\nThe routing table consists of at least three information fields:\nDepending on the application and implementation, it can also contain additional values that refine path selection: \nShown below is an example of what the table above could look like on a computer connected to the internet via a home router:\nForwarding table.\nRouting tables are generally not used directly for packet forwarding in modern router architectures; instead, they are used to generate the information for a simpler forwarding table. This forwarding table contains only the routes which are chosen by the routing algorithm as preferred routes for packet forwarding. It is often in a compressed or pre-compiled format that is optimized for hardware storage and lookup.\nThis router architecture separates the control plane function of the routing table from the forwarding plane function of the forwarding table. This separation of control and forwarding provides uninterrupted high-performance forwarding.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

S. Lewis's argument from reason is also a kind of transcendental argument.\nMost contemporary formulations of a transcendental argument for God have been developed within the framework of Christian presuppositional apologetics and the likes of Cornelius Van Til and Greg Bahnsen.\nTranscendental reasoning.\n\"Transcendental\" in this case is used as an adjective specifying a specific kind of argument, and not a noun. Transcendental arguments should not be confused with arguments for the existence of something transcendent. Rather, transcendental arguments are arguments that make inferences from the ability to think and experience.\nSo-called \"progressive\" transcendental arguments begin with an apparently indubitable and universally accepted statement about people's experiences of the world. They use this to make substantive knowledge-claims about the world, e.g., that it \"is\" causally and spatiotemporally related. They start with what is left at the \"end\" of the skeptic's process of doubting.\nProgressive transcendental arguments take the form of modus ponens with modal operators:\nIf possibly \"P\", then necessarily \"Q\".\nActually \"P\".\nTherefore, necessarily \"Q\".\n\"Regressive\" transcendental arguments, on the other hand, \"begin at the same point\" as the skeptic, e.g., the fact that we have experience of a causal and spatiotemporal world, and show that certain notions are implicit in our conceptions of such experience. Regressive transcendental arguments are more conservative in that they do not purport to make substantive ontological claims about the world.\nRegressive transcendental arguments take the form of modus tollens with modal operators:\nIf possibly \"P\", then necessarily \"Q\".\nActually not \"Q\".\nTherefore, necessarily not \"P\".\nThey are also sometimes said to be distinct from standard deductive and inductive forms of reasoning, although this has been disputed, for instance by Anthony Genova and Graham Bird.\nThe argument.\nThere are many versions of the transcendental argument for the existence of God (both progressive and regressive), but they generally proceed as follows:\nThe transcendental unity of apperception refers to the combination of different impressions, experiences and categories into a single, intelligible consciousness held by a person. It is argued that the negation of the existence of God therefore entails the impossibility of knowledge, which is self-refuting.\nThe TAG differs from thomistic and evidentialist arguments, which presuppose the validity of human perception and judgement when proving the existence of God.\nAsh'ari.\nMedieval Ash'ari Islamic theologians formulated a type of transcendental argument based on the notion that morality, logic, etc. cannot be fully understood apart from revelation and thereby, belief in the Quran and the Islamic truth claims were necessary in order to interpret the external world. For al-Ashari and others, it does not make sense to argue against religion using a priori assumptions about morality or scientific probabilities when these can only be understood in light of divine revelation.\nCriticism.\nB\u00e1lint B\u00e9kefi has argued that TAG, as an ambitious transcendental argument, is susceptible to the Stroudian objection that how things must appear is not necessarily how things actually are. He also argues that the two strategies available to apologists for responding to Stroud are unsuccessful, and thus it is unlikely that TAG can overcome the Stroudian objection.\nPresuppositional apologetics.\nInternet Infidels co-founder Jeffery Jay Lowder has argued that the presuppositional apologetics' version of TAG is fatally flawed for numerous reasons. First, Bahnsen fails to defend the \"necessity\" of Christianity instead of the mere \"sufficiency\" for the rational justification of the laws of logic, the laws of science, and the laws of morality. In other words, such reasoning affirms the consequent.\nSecond, Bahnsen conflates \"atheism\" with \"materialism\" and has really presented an argument against materialism, not an argument for Christianity. Third, Bahnsen believed that the laws of logic, laws of science, and laws of morality are abstract objects, but Christianity arguably underdetermines the relationship between God and abstract objects. Some Christian philosophers, such as Peter van Inwagen, affirm Platonism and the compatibility of God and abstract objects. But other Christian philosophers argue that Platonism is incompatible with divine aseity. William Lane Craig urges Christian philosophers to consider anti-realist theories of abstract objects.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, knowing that all men are mortal (major premise), and that Socrates is a man (minor premise), we may validly conclude that Socrates is mortal. Syllogistic arguments are usually represented in a three-line form: \n&lt;poem&gt;All men are mortal.\nSocrates is a man.\nTherefore, Socrates is mortal.&lt;/poem&gt;In antiquity, two rival syllogistic theories existed: Aristotelian syllogism and Stoic syllogism. From the Middle Ages onwards, \"categorical syllogism\" and \"syllogism\" were usually used interchangeably. This article is concerned only with this historical use. The syllogism was at the core of historical deductive reasoning, whereby facts are determined by combining existing statements, in contrast to inductive reasoning, in which facts are predicted by repeated observations.\nWithin some academic contexts, syllogism has been superseded by first-order predicate logic following the work of Gottlob Frege, in particular his \"Begriffsschrift\" (\"Concept Script\"; 1879). Syllogism, being a method of valid logical reasoning, will always be useful in most circumstances, and for general-audience introductions to logic and clear-thinking.\nEarly history.\nIn antiquity, two rival syllogistic theories existed: Aristotelian syllogism and Stoic syllogism.\nAristotle.\nAristotle defines the syllogism as \"a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so.\" Despite this very general definition, in \"Prior Analytics\" Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms that consist of three categorical propositions, including categorical modal syllogisms.\nThe use of syllogisms as a tool for understanding can be dated back to the logical reasoning discussions of Aristotle. Before the mid-12th century, medieval logicians were only familiar with a portion of Aristotle's works, including such titles as \"Categories\" and \"On Interpretation\", works that contributed heavily to the prevailing Old Logic, or \"logica vetus\". The onset of a New Logic, or \"logica nova\", arose alongside the reappearance of \"Prior Analytics\", the work in which Aristotle developed his theory of the syllogism.\n\"Prior Analytics\", upon rediscovery, was instantly regarded by logicians as \"a closed and complete body of doctrine\", leaving very little for thinkers of the day to debate, and reorganize. Aristotle's theory on the syllogism for \"assertoric\" sentences was considered especially remarkable, with only small systematic changes occurring to the concept over time. This theory of the syllogism would not enter the context of the more comprehensive logic of consequence until logic began to be reworked in general in the mid-14th century by the likes of John Buridan.\nAristotle's \"Prior Analytics\" did not, however, incorporate such a comprehensive theory on the modal syllogism\u2014a syllogism that has at least one modalized premise, that is, a premise containing the modal words \"necessarily\", \"possibly\", or \"contingently\". Aristotle's terminology in this aspect of his theory was deemed vague, and in many cases unclear, even contradicting some of his statements from \"On Interpretation\". His original assertions on this specific component of the theory were left up to a considerable amount of conversation, resulting in a wide array of solutions put forth by commentators of the day. The system for modal syllogisms laid forth by Aristotle would ultimately be deemed unfit for practical use, and would be replaced by new distinctions and new theories altogether.\nMedieval syllogism.\nBoethius.\nBoethius (c. 475\u2013526) contributed an effort to make the ancient Aristotelian logic more accessible. While his Latin translation of \"Prior Analytics\" went primarily unused before the 12th century, his textbooks on the categorical syllogism were central to expanding the syllogistic discussion. Rather than in any additions that he personally made to the field, Boethius' logical legacy lies in his effective transmission of prior theories to later logicians, as well as his clear and primarily accurate presentations of Aristotle's contributions.\nPeter Abelard.\nAnother of medieval logic's first contributors from the Latin West, Peter Abelard (1079\u20131142), gave his own thorough evaluation of the syllogism concept, and accompanying theory in the \"Dialectica\"\u2014a discussion of logic based on Boethius' commentaries and monographs. His perspective on syllogisms can be found in other works as well, such as \"Logica Ingredientibus\". With the help of Abelard's distinction between \"de dicto\" modal sentences and \"de re\" modal sentences, medieval logicians began to shape a more coherent concept of Aristotle's modal syllogism model.\nJean Buridan.\nThe French philosopher Jean Buridan (c. 1300\u00a0\u2013 1361), whom some consider the foremost logician of the later Middle Ages, contributed two significant works: \"Treatise on Consequence\" and \"Summulae de Dialectica\", in which he discussed the concept of the syllogism, its components and distinctions, and ways to use the tool to expand its logical capability. For 200 years after Buridan's discussions, little was said about syllogistic logic. Historians of logic have assessed that the primary changes in the post-Middle Age era were changes in respect to the public's awareness of original sources, a lessening of appreciation for the logic's sophistication and complexity, and an increase in logical ignorance\u2014so that logicians of the early 20th century came to view the whole system as ridiculous.\nModern history.\nThe Aristotelian syllogism dominated Western philosophical thought for many centuries. Syllogism itself is about drawing valid conclusions from assumptions (axioms), rather than about verifying the assumptions. However, people over time focused on the logic aspect, forgetting the importance of verifying the assumptions.\nIn the 17th century, Francis Bacon emphasized that experimental verification of axioms must be carried out rigorously, and cannot take syllogism itself as the best way to draw conclusions in nature. Bacon proposed a more inductive approach to the observation of nature, which involves experimentation, and leads to discovering and building on axioms to create a more general conclusion. Yet, a full method of drawing conclusions in nature is not the scope of logic or syllogism, and the inductive method was covered in Aristotle's subsequent treatise, the \"Posterior Analytics\".\nIn the 19th century, modifications to syllogism were incorporated to deal with disjunctive (\"A or B\") and conditional (\"if A then B\") statements. Immanuel Kant famously claimed, in \"Logic\" (1800), that logic was the one completed science, and that Aristotelian logic more or less included everything about logic that there was to know. (This work is not necessarily representative of Kant's mature philosophy, which is often regarded as an innovation to logic itself.) Kant's opinion stood unchallenged in the West until 1879, when Gottlob Frege published his \"Begriffsschrift\" (\"Concept Script\"). This introduced a calculus, a method of representing categorical statements (and statements that are not provided for in syllogism as well) by the use of quantifiers and variables.\nA noteworthy exception is the logic developed in Bernard Bolzano's work \"Wissenschaftslehre\" (\"Theory of Science\", 1837), the principles of which were applied as a direct critique of Kant, in the posthumously published work \"New Anti-Kant\" (1850). The work of Bolzano had been largely overlooked until the late 20th century, among other reasons, because of the intellectual environment at the time in Bohemia, which was then part of the Austrian Empire. In the last 20 years, Bolzano's work has resurfaced and become subject of both translation and contemporary study.\nOne notable exception to this modern relegation is the continued application of Aristotelian logic by officials of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and the Apostolic Tribunal of the Roman Rota, which still requires that any arguments crafted by Advocates be presented in syllogistic format.\nBoole's acceptance of Aristotle.\nGeorge Boole's unwavering acceptance of Aristotle's logic is emphasized by the historian of logic John Corcoran in an accessible introduction to \"Laws of Thought\". Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of \"Prior Analytics\" and \"Laws of Thought\". According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle's logic. Boole's goals were \"to go under, over, and beyond\" Aristotle's logic by:\nMore specifically, Boole agreed with what Aristotle said; Boole's 'disagreements', if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced Aristotle's four propositional forms to one form, the form of equations, which by itself was a revolutionary idea. Second, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic\u2014another revolutionary idea\u2014involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the \"perfect syllogisms\") must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. Third, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments, whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce: \"No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus\" from \"No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle\" or from \"No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle.\"\nBasic structure.\nA categorical syllogism consists of three parts:\nEach part is a categorical proposition, and each categorical proposition contains two categorical terms. In Aristotle, each of the premises is in the form \"All S are P,\" \"Some S are P\", \"No S are P\" or \"Some S are not P\", where \"S\" is the subject-term and \"P\" is the predicate-term:\nMore modern logicians allow some variation. Each of the premises has one term in common with the conclusion: in a major premise, this is the \"major term\" (i.e., the predicate of the conclusion); in a minor premise, this is the \"minor term\" (i.e., the subject of the conclusion). For example:\nMajor premise: All humans are mortal.\nMinor premise: All Greeks are humans.\nConclusion/Consequent: All Greeks are mortal.\nEach of the three distinct terms represents a category. From the example above, \"humans\", \"mortal\", and \"Greeks\": \"mortal\" is the major term, and \"Greeks\" the minor term. The premises also have one term in common with each other, which is known as the \"middle term\"; in this example, \"humans\". Both of the premises are universal, as is the conclusion.\nMajor premise: All mortals die.\nMinor premise: All men are mortals.\nConclusion/Consequent: All men die.\nHere, the major term is \"die\", the minor term is \"men\", and the middle term is \"mortals\". Again, both premises are universal, hence so is the conclusion.\nPolysyllogism.\nA polysyllogism, or a sorites, is a form of argument in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. For example, one might argue that all lions are big cats, all big cats are predators, and all predators are carnivores. To conclude that therefore all lions are carnivores is to construct a sorites argument.\nTypes.\nThere are infinitely many possible syllogisms, but only 256 logically distinct types and only 24 valid types (enumerated below). A syllogism takes the form (note: M\u00a0\u2013 Middle, S\u00a0\u2013 subject, P\u00a0\u2013 predicate.):\nMajor premise: All M are P.\nMinor premise: All S are M.\nConclusion/Consequent: All S are P.\nThe premises and conclusion of a syllogism can be any of four types, which are labeled by letters as follows. The meaning of the letters is given by the table:\nIn \"Prior Analytics\", Aristotle uses mostly the letters A, B, and C (Greek letters \"alpha\", \"beta\", and \"gamma\") as term placeholders, rather than giving concrete examples. It is traditional to use \"is\" rather than \"are\" as the copula, hence \"All A is B\" rather than \"All As are Bs\". It is traditional and convenient practice to use a, e, i, o as infix operators so the categorical statements can be written succinctly. The following table shows the longer form, the succinct shorthand, and equivalent expressions in predicate logic:\nThe convention here is that the letter S is the subject of the conclusion, P is the predicate of the conclusion, and M is the middle term. The major premise links M with P and the minor premise links M with S. However, the middle term can be either the subject or the predicate of each premise where it appears. The differing positions of the major, minor, and middle terms gives rise to another classification of syllogisms known as the \"figure\". Given that in each case the conclusion is S-P, the four figures are:\nPutting it all together, there are 256 possible types of syllogisms (or 512 if the order of the major and minor premises is changed, though this makes no difference logically). Each premise and the conclusion can be of type A, E, I or O, and the syllogism can be any of the four figures. A syllogism can be described briefly by giving the letters for the premises and conclusion followed by the number for the figure. For example, the syllogism BARBARA below is AAA-1, or \"A-A-A in the first figure\".\nThe vast majority of the 256 possible forms of syllogism are invalid (the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises). The table below shows the valid forms. Even some of these are sometimes considered to commit the existential fallacy, meaning they are invalid if they mention an empty category. These controversial patterns are marked in \"italics\". All but four of the patterns in italics (felapton, darapti, fesapo and bamalip) are weakened moods, i.e. it is possible to draw a stronger conclusion from the premises.\nThe letters A, E, I, and O have been used since the medieval Schools to form mnemonic names for the forms as follows: 'Barbara' stands for AAA, 'Celarent' for EAE, etc.\nNext to each premise and conclusion is a shorthand description of the sentence. So in AAI-3, the premise \"All squares are rectangles\" becomes \"MaP\"; the symbols mean that the first term (\"square\") is the middle term, the second term (\"rectangle\") is the predicate of the conclusion, and the relationship between the two terms is labeled \"a\" (All M are P).\nThe following table shows all syllogisms that are essentially different. The similar syllogisms share the same premises, just written in a different way. For example \"Some pets are kittens\" (SiM in Darii) could also be written as \"Some kittens are pets\" (MiS in Datisi).\nIn the Venn diagrams, the black areas indicate no elements, and the red areas indicate at least one element. In the predicate logic expressions, a horizontal bar over an expression means to negate (\"logical not\") the result of that expression.\nIt is also possible to use graphs (consisting of vertices and edges) to evaluate syllogisms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All men are mortal.

Columns indicate similarity, and are grouped by combinations of premises. Borders correspond to conclusions. Those with an existential assumption are dashed. \nSyllogistic fallacies.\nPeople often make mistakes when reasoning syllogistically.\nFor instance, from the premises some A are B, some B are C, people tend to come to a definitive conclusion that therefore some A are C. However, this does not follow according to the rules of classical logic. For instance, while some cats (A) are black things (B), and some black things (B) are televisions (C), it does not follow from the parameters that some cats (A) are televisions (C). This is because in the structure of the syllogism invoked (i.e. III-1) the middle term is not distributed in either the major premise or in the minor premise, a pattern called the \"fallacy of the undistributed middle\". Because of this, it can be hard to follow formal logic, and a closer eye is needed in order to ensure that an argument is, in fact, valid.\nDetermining the validity of a syllogism involves determining the distribution of each term in each statement, meaning whether all members of that term are accounted for.\nIn simple syllogistic patterns, the fallacies of invalid patterns are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word itself relates to Japanese speakers' tendency to struggle to pronounce the English and distinctly arising from the fact Japanese has only one liquid phoneme (usually romanized \"r\"), but its definition encompasses many more errors. Terms such as \"Japanglish\", \"Japlish\", \"Jinglish\", or \"Janglish\" are more specific to Japanese Engrish. The related Japanese term \"wasei-eigo\" (: 'Japanese-made English') refers to pseudo-anglicisms that have entered everyday Japanese.\nThe term \"Engrish\" first appears in the 1940s (suggestive of a mispronunciation of \"English\") but it was not until the 1980s that it began to be used as a byname for defective Asian English. While the term may refer to spoken English, it often describes written English. Engrish can be found in many places, including signs, menus, and advertisements. The words are frequently humorous to speakers of English.\nIn Japan, for example, it is common to add English text to items for decorative and fashion purposes (see \"cool\"). Such text is often added to create a cosmopolitan feeling rather than to be read by native English speakers, and so may often be meaningless or grammatically incorrect.\nJapanese Engrish / Japanglish.\nJapanese and English have significantly different grammar: Japanese word order, the frequent omission of subjects in Japanese, the absence of articles, a near-complete absence of consonant clusters, and difficulties in distinguishing /l/ and /r/, or /\u03b8/ and /s/ sounds, all contribute to substantial problems using Standard English effectively. Japanese people have tended to score comparatively poorly on international tests of English.\nFurther, English is frequently used in Japan (and elsewhere) for aesthetic rather than functional purposes; i.e., for Japanese consumption, not for English speakers \"per se\", as a way of appearing \"smart, sophisticated and modern\", in much the same way as Japanese and similar writing scripts are used in Western fashion. Such decorative English is not meant to be read and understood by native English speakers, so emphasis is not placed on coherence or accuracy.\nThe Japanese language also makes extensive use of loanwords, especially from English in recent decades, and these words are transliterated into a Japanese form of pronunciation using the katakana syllabary. Japanese speakers may thus only be familiar with the Japanese pronunciation or Japanese meaning, rather than its original pronunciation or meaning. This is particularly the case when the source English word contains sounds or sound clusters which have no equivalent in katakana.\nIn popular culture.\nEngrish has been featured occasionally in \"South Park\", an American animated TV show by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. One example is the song \"Let's Fighting Love\", used in the episode \"Good Times with Weapons\", which parodies the poorly translated opening theme sequences sometimes shown in anime. Parker and Stone's feature-length film \"\" (2004) also features Engrish when the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il is depicted singing the song \"I'm so Ronery\".\nThe British fashion brand Superdry, which takes inspiration from Japanese clothing styles, has established a style of placing meaningless Japanese text such as 'Sunglasses company' and 'membership certificate' on clothing sold in Britain. The company explained to a Japanese television news programme that most translations were done using simple automatic translation programs such as Babel Fish, without attempting to make the texts accurate.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48049", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48049", "title": "Autonomous robot", "text": "Robot that performs behaviors or tasks with a high degree of autonomy\nAn autonomous robot is a robot that acts without recourse to human control. Historic examples include space probes. Modern examples include self-driving vacuums and cars.\nIndustrial robot arms that work on assembly lines inside factories may also be considered autonomous robots, though their autonomy is restricted due to a highly structured environment and their inability to locomote.\nComponents and criteria of robotic autonomy.\nSelf-maintenance.\nThe first requirement for complete physical autonomy is the ability for a robot to take care of itself. Many of the battery-powered robots on the market today can find and connect to a charging station, and some toys like Sony's \"Aibo\" are capable of self-docking to charge their batteries.\nSelf-maintenance is based on \"proprioception\", or sensing one's own internal status. In the battery charging example, the robot can tell proprioceptively that its batteries are low, and it then seeks the charger. Another common proprioceptive sensor is for heat monitoring. Increased proprioception will be required for robots to work autonomously near people and in harsh environments. Common proprioceptive sensors include thermal, optical, and haptic sensing, as well as the Hall effect (electric).\nSensing the environment.\nExteroception is sensing things about the environment. Autonomous robots must have a range of environmental sensors to perform their task and stay out of trouble. The autonomous robot can recognize sensor failures and minimize the impact on the performance caused by failures.\nSome robotic lawn mowers will adapt their programming by detecting the speed in which grass grows as needed to maintain a perfectly cut lawn, and some vacuum cleaning robots have dirt detectors that sense how much dirt is being picked up and use this information to tell them to stay in one area longer.\nTask performance.\nThe next step in autonomous behavior is to actually perform a physical task. A new area showing commercial promise is domestic robots, with a flood of small vacuuming robots beginning with iRobot and Electrolux in 2002. While the level of intelligence is not high in these systems, they navigate over wide areas and pilot in tight situations around homes using contact and non-contact sensors. Both of these robots use proprietary algorithms to increase coverage over simple random bounce.\nThe next level of autonomous task performance requires a robot to perform conditional tasks. For instance, security robots can be programmed to detect intruders and respond in a particular way depending upon where the intruder is. For example, Amazon launched its Astro for home monitoring, security and eldercare in September 2021.\nAutonomous navigation.\nIndoor navigation.\nFor a robot to associate behaviors with a place (localization) requires it to know where it is and to be able to navigate point-to-point. Such navigation began with wire-guidance in the 1970s and progressed in the early 2000s to beacon-based triangulation. Current commercial robots autonomously navigate based on sensing natural features. The first commercial robots to achieve this were Pyxus' HelpMate hospital robot and the CyberMotion guard robot, both designed by robotics pioneers in the 1980s. These robots originally used manually created CAD floor plans, sonar sensing and wall-following variations to navigate buildings. The next generation, such as MobileRobots' PatrolBot and autonomous wheelchair, both introduced in 2004, have the ability to create their own laser-based maps of a building and to navigate open areas as well as corridors. Their control system changes its path on the fly if something blocks the way.\nAt first, autonomous navigation was based on planar sensors, such as laser range-finders, that can only sense at one level. The most advanced systems now fuse information from various sensors for both localization (position) and navigation. Systems such as Motivity can rely on different sensors in different areas, depending upon which provides the most reliable data at the time, and can re-map a building autonomously.\nRather than climb stairs, which requires highly specialized hardware, most indoor robots navigate handicapped-accessible areas, controlling elevators and electronic doors. With such electronic access-control interfaces, robots can now freely navigate indoors. Autonomously climbing stairs and opening doors manually are topics of research at the current time.\nAs these indoor techniques continue to develop, vacuuming robots will gain the ability to clean a specific user-specified room or a whole floor. Security robots will be able to cooperatively surround intruders and cut off exits. These advances also bring concomitant protections: robots' internal maps typically permit \"forbidden areas\" to be defined to prevent robots from autonomously entering certain regions.\nOutdoor navigation.\nOutdoor autonomy is most easily achieved in the air, since obstacles are rare. Cruise missiles are rather dangerous highly autonomous robots. Pilotless drone aircraft are increasingly used for reconnaissance. Some of these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of flying their entire mission without any human interaction at all except possibly for the landing where a person intervenes using radio remote control. Some drones are capable of safe, automatic landings, however. SpaceX operates a number of autonomous spaceport drone ships, used to safely land and recover Falcon 9 rockets at sea. Few countries like India started working on https:// of food and other articles by drone.\nOutdoor autonomy is the most difficult for ground vehicles, due to:\nOpen problems in autonomous robotics.\nSeveral open problems in autonomous robotics are special to the field rather than being a part of the general pursuit of AI. According to George A. Bekey's \"Autonomous Robots: From Biological Inspiration to Implementation and Control\", problems include things such as making sure the robot is able to function correctly and not run into obstacles autonomously. Reinforcement learning has been used to control and plan the navigation of autonomous robots, specifically when a group of them operates in collaboration with each other.\nResearchers concerned with creating true artificial life are concerned not only with intelligent control, but further with the capacity of the robot to find its own resources through foraging (looking for food, which includes both energy and spare parts).\nThis is related to autonomous foraging, a concern within the sciences of behavioral ecology, social anthropology, and human behavioral ecology; as well as robotics, artificial intelligence, and artificial life.\nSystemic robustness and real-world brittleness\nAutonomous robots remain highly vulnerable to unexpected changes in real-world environments. Even minor variations like a sudden beam of sunlight disrupting vision systems or unanticipated terrain irregularities can cause entire systems to fail. This brittleness stems from robotics being an inherently systems problem, where a deficiency in any module (perception, planning, actuation) can compromise the whole robot.\nOpen-world scene understanding\nRobots often depend on datasets captured under controlled conditions, limiting their ability to generalize to novel, dynamic real-world scenarios. They struggle with unknown objects, occlusions, varying object scales, and rapidly changing environments. Developing self-supervised, lifelong learning systems that adapt to open-world conditions remains a pressing challenge.\nMulti-robot coordination and decentralization\nScaling robot systems raises thorny issues in coordination, safety, and communication. In multi-agent navigation, challenges like deadlocks, selfish behaviors, and sample inefficiencies emerge. Innovations such as dividing planning into sub-problems, combining RL with imitation learning, hybrid centralized-decentralized approaches (e.g., prioritized communication learning), attention mechanisms, and graph transformers have shown promise, but large-scale, stable, real-time coordination remains an open frontier.\nSimulation-to-real (\u201creality gap\u201d) transfer\nDeep reinforcement learning is a powerful tool for teaching robots navigation and control, but training in simulation introduces discrepancies when deployed in reality. The reality gap (or differences between simulated and real environments) continues to impede reliable deployment, despite strategies to mitigate it.\nHardware and bio hybrid constraints\nPhysical limitations of batteries, motors, sensors, and actuators constrain robot autonomy, endurance, and adaptability, especially for humanoid or soft-bio hybrid robots. While Biohybrid system (e.g., using living muscle tissue) hint at leveraging biological energy and actuation, they introduce radically new challenges in materials, integration, and control.\nEthics, liability, and societal integration\nAs robots become more autonomous, especially in public or collaborative roles, ethical and legal issues grow. Who is responsible when an autonomous system causes harm? Regulatory frameworks are still evolving to address liability, transparency, bias, and safety in systems like Self-driving car or socially interactive robots.\nEmbodied AI and industrial adoption\nWhile AI algorithms have made strides, embedding them into robots (embodied AI) for real-world use remains slow-moving. Hardware constraints, economic viability, and infrastructure limitations limit widespread adoption. For instance, humanoid robots like \u201cPepper (robot)\u201d failed to achieve ubiquity due to fundamental cost and complexity issues.\nSystemic robustness and real-world brittleness\nAutonomous robots remain highly vulnerable to unexpected changes in real-world environments. Even minor variations like a sudden beam of sunlight disrupting vision systems or unanticipated terrain irregularities can cause entire systems to fail. This brittleness stems from robotics being an inherently systems problem, where a deficiency in any module (perception, planning, actuation) can compromise the whole robot.\nSocietal impact and issues.\nAs autonomous robots have grown in ability and technical levels, there has been increasing societal awareness and news coverage of the latest advances, and also some of the philosophical issues, economic effects, and societal impacts that arise from the roles and activities of autonomous robots.\nElon Musk, a prominent business executive and billionaire has warned for years of the possible hazards and pitfalls of autonomous robots; however, his own company is one of the most prominent companies that is trying to devise new advanced technologies in this area.\nIn 2021, a United Nations group of government experts, known as the \"Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons \u2013 Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems\", held a conference to highlight the ethical concerns which arise from the increasingly advanced technology for autonomous robots to wield weapons and to play a military role.\nTechnical development.\nEarly robots.\nThe first autonomous robots were known as Elmer and Elsie, constructed in the late 1940s by W. Grey Walter. They were the first robots programmed to \"think\" the way biological brains do and were meant to have free will. Elmer and Elsie were often labeled as tortoises because of how they were shaped and the manner in which they moved. They were capable of phototaxis, the movement that occurs in response to light stimulus.\nSpace probes.\nThe Mars rovers MER-A and MER-B (now known as \"Spirit\" rover and \"Opportunity\" rover) found the position of the Sun and navigated their own routes to destinations, on the fly, by:\nThe planned ESA Rover, \"Rosalind Franklin\" rover, is capable of vision based relative localisation and absolute localisation to autonomously navigate safe and efficient trajectories to targets by:\nDuring the final NASA Sample Return Robot Centennial Challenge in 2016, a rover, named Cataglyphis, successfully demonstrated fully autonomous navigation, decision-making, and sample detection, retrieval, and return capabilities. The rover relied on a fusion of measurements from inertial sensors, wheel encoders, Lidar, and camera for navigation and mapping, instead of using GPS or magnetometers. During the 2-hour challenge, Cataglyphis traversed over 2.6\u00a0km and returned five different samples to its starting position.\nGeneral-use autonomous robots.\nThe Seekur robot was the first commercially available robot to demonstrate MDARS-like capabilities for general use by airports, utility plants, corrections facilities and Homeland Security.\nThe DARPA Grand Challenge and DARPA Urban Challenge have encouraged development of even more autonomous capabilities for ground vehicles, while this has been the demonstrated goal for aerial robots since 1990 as part of the AUVSI International Aerial Robotics Competition.\nAMR transfer carts developed by Seyiton are used to transfer loads of up to 1500 kilograms inside factories.\nBetween 2013 and 2017, TotalEnergies has held the ARGOS Challenge to develop the first autonomous robot for oil and gas production sites. The robots had to face adverse outdoor conditions such as rain, wind and extreme temperatures.\nSome significant current robots include: \nMilitary autonomous robots.\nLethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) are a type of autonomous robot military system that can independently search for and engage targets based on programmed constraints and descriptions. LAWs are also known as lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS), autonomous weapon systems (AWS), robotic weapons, killer robots or slaughterbots. LAWs may operate in the air, on land, on water, under water, or in space. The autonomy of current systems as of 2018[ [update]] was restricted in the sense that a human gives the final command to attack \u2013 though there are exceptions with certain \"defensive\" systems.\nTypes of robots.\nHumanoid.\nTesla Robot and NVIDIA GR00T are humanoid robots. Humanoids are machines that are designed to mimic the human form in appearance and behavior. These robots typically have a head, torso, arms, and legs, making them look like humans.\nDelivery robot.\nA delivery robot is an autonomous robot used for delivering goods.\nCharging robot.\nAn automatic charging robot, unveiled on July 27, 2022, is an arm-shaped robot to charge an electric vehicle. It has been running a pilot operation at Hyundai Motor Group's headquarters since 2021. VISION AI System based on deep learning technology has been applied. When an electric vehicle is parked in front of the charger, the robot arm recognizes the charger of the electric vehicle and derives coordinates. And automatically insert a connector into the electric car and operate fast charging. The robot arm is configured in a vertical multi-joint structure so that it can be applied to chargers at different locations for each vehicle. In addition, waterproof and dustproof functions are applied.\nConstruction robots.\nConstruction robots are used directly on job sites and perform work such as building, material handling, earthmoving, and surveillance.\nResearch and education mobile robots.\nResearch and education mobile robots are mainly used during a prototyping phase in the process of building full scale robots. They are a scaled down version of bigger robots with the same types of sensors, kinematics and software stack (e.g. ROS). They are often extendable and provide comfortable programming interface and development tools. Next to full scale robot prototyping they are also used for education, especially at university level, where more and more labs about programming autonomous vehicles are being introduced.\nLegislation.\nIn March 2016, a bill was introduced in Washington, D.C., allowing pilot ground robotic deliveries. The program was to take place from September 15 through the end of December 2017. The robots were limited to a weight of 50 pounds unloaded and a maximum speed of 10 miles per hour. In case the robot stopped moving because of malfunction the company was required to remove it from the streets within 24 hours. There were allowed only 5 robots to be tested per company at a time. A 2017 version of the Personal Delivery Device Act bill was under review as of March 2017.\nIn February 2017, a bill was passed in the US state of Virginia via the House bill, HB2016, and the Senate bill, SB1207, that will allow autonomous delivery robots to travel on sidewalks and use crosswalks statewide beginning on July 1, 2017. The robots will be limited to a maximum speed of 10\u00a0mph and a maximum weight of 50 pounds. In the states of Idaho and Florida there are also talks about passing the similar legislature.\nIt has been discussed that robots with similar characteristics to invalid carriages (e.g. 10\u00a0mph maximum, limited battery life) might be a workaround for certain classes of applications. If the robot was sufficiently intelligent and able to recharge itself using the existing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure it would only need minimal supervision and a single arm with low dexterity might be enough to enable this function if its visual systems had enough resolution.\nIn November 2017, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors announced that companies would need to get a city permit in order to test these robots. In addition, the Board banned sidewalk delivery robots from making non-research deliveries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was educated at the University of Toronto (B.A. (Hons.), 1954), Harvard University (A.M., 1955), and the University of Oxford (B.Phil., 1957; D.Phil., 1961).\nGauthier taught at the University of Toronto from 1958 until 1980, when he joined the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, where he remained for the rest of his career.\nIn the 1962 Canadian federal election, Gauthier ran as a candidate for the New Democratic Party in the riding of Eglinton, in Toronto, placing third.\nGauthier also held visiting appointments at the University of California, Long Angeles, the University of California, Berkeley, Princeton University, the University of California, Irvine, and the University of Waterloo.\nIn 1979, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (F.R.S.C.). The asteroid 15911 Davidgauthier (1997 TL21) was named in his honour.\nGauthier died on 9 November 2023, at the age of 91.\nPhilosophy.\nGauthier was the author of numerous articles, some of the most important of which are collected in \"Moral Dealing\", as well as several books including \"Practical Reasoning\", \"The Logic of Leviathan\", \"Morals by Agreement\", and \"Rousseau: The Sentiment of Existence\".\nIn addition to systematic work in moral theory, Gauthier was also interested in the history of political philosophy, especially Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He conducted work on the theory of practical rationality, where he began from an attempt to understand economic rationality, rather than from Kantian or Aristotelian antecedents.\nGauthier understood value as a matter of individuals' subjective preferences, and argued that moral constraints on straightforward utility-maximizing are prudentially justified. He argued that it is most prudent to give up straightforward maximizing and instead adopt a disposition of constrained maximization, according to which one resolves to cooperate with all similarly disposed persons (those disposed towards cooperation) and defect on the rest (straightforward maximizers), since repeated cooperation provides greater yields than repeated mutual defection from contracts (as is seen in a basic Prisoner's dilemma game). According to Gauthier's contractarian ethics, moral constraints are justified because they make us all better off, in terms of our preferences (whatever they may be). A consequence is that good moral thinking is just an elevated and subtly strategic version of means\u2013end reasoning.\nIn \"Morals by Agreement\", Gauthier defines translucency. An individual is translucent if their intentions can be guessed or judged by other individuals. Celeste M. Friend argues against the argument of translucency in the evolution of cooperation. First, translucency might not be realistic in human societies. This first argument was first brought by Geoffrey Sayre-McCord. \u00a0Second, translucency might be the product of social interactions: one becomes often more translucent as trust is gained, and not the other way round. Finally, excessive translucency would also reveal the underlying self-interest in being translucent, therefore hindering cooperation. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48053", "revid": "1310654128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48053", "title": "Moral relativism", "text": "Philosophical positions about the differences in moral judgments across peoples and cultures\nMoral relativism or ethical relativism (often reformulated as relativist ethics or relativist morality) is used to describe several philosophical positions concerned with the differences in moral judgments across different peoples and cultures. An advocate of such ideas is often referred to as a relativist.\n\"Descriptive\" moral relativism holds that people do, in fact, disagree fundamentally about what is moral, without passing any evaluative or normative judgments about this disagreement. \"Meta-ethical\" moral relativism holds that moral judgments contain an (implicit or explicit) indexical such that, to the extent they are truth-apt , their truth-value changes with context of use. \"Normative\" moral relativism holds that everyone \"ought\" to tolerate the behavior of others even when large disagreements about morality exist. Though often intertwined, these are distinct positions. Each can be held independently of the others.\nAmerican philosopher Richard Rorty in particular has argued that the label of being a \"relativist\" has become warped and turned into a sort of pejorative. He has written specifically that thinkers labeled as such usually simply believe \"that the grounds for choosing between such [philosophical] opinions is less algorithmic than had been thought\", not that every single conceptual idea is as valid as any other. In this spirit, Rorty has lamented that \"philosophers have... become increasingly isolated from the rest of culture.\"\nMoral relativism has been debated for thousands of years across a variety of contexts during the history of civilization. Arguments of particular notability have been made in areas such as ancient Greece and historical India while discussions have continued to the present day. Besides the material created by philosophers, the concept has additionally attracted attention in diverse fields including art, religion, and science.\nVariations.\nDescriptive.\nDescriptive moral relativism is merely the positive or descriptive position that there exist, in fact, fundamental disagreements about the right course of action even when the same facts hold true and the same consequences seem likely to arise. It is the observation that different cultures have different moral standards.\nDescriptive relativists do not necessarily advocate the tolerance of all behavior in light of such disagreement; that is to say, they are not necessarily normative relativists. Likewise, they do not necessarily make any commitments to the semantics, ontology, or epistemology of moral judgement; that is, not all descriptive relativists are meta-ethical relativists.\nDescriptive relativism is a widespread position in academic fields such as anthropology and sociology, which simply admit that it is incorrect to assume that the same moral or ethical frameworks are always in play in all historical and cultural circumstances.\nMeta-ethical.\nMeta-ethical moral relativists believe not only that people disagree about moral issues, but that terms such as \"good\", \"bad\", \"right\" and \"wrong\" do not stand subject to universal truth conditions at all; rather, they are relative to the traditions, convictions, or practices of an individual or a group of people. The American anthropologist William Graham Sumner was an influential advocate of this view. He argues in his 1906 work \"Folkways\" that what people consider right and wrong is shaped entirely\u2014not primarily\u2014by the traditions, customs, and practices of their culture. Moreover, since in his analysis of human understanding there cannot be any higher moral standard than that provided by the local morals of a culture, no trans-cultural judgement about the rightness or wrongness of a culture's morals could possibly be justified.\nMeta-ethical relativists are, first, descriptive relativists: they believe that, given the same set of facts, some societies or individuals will have a fundamental disagreement about what a person \"ought\" to do or prefer (based on societal or individual norms). What's more, they argue that one cannot adjudicate these disagreements using any available independent standard of evaluation\u2014any appeal to a relevant standard would always be merely personal or at best societal.\nThis view contrasts with moral universalism, which argues that, even though well-intentioned persons disagree, and some may even remain unpersuadable (e.g. someone who is closed-minded), there is still a meaningful sense in which an action could be more \"moral\" (morally preferable) than another; that is, they believe there \"are\" objective standards of evaluation that seem worth calling \"moral facts\"\u2014regardless of whether they are universally accepted.\nNormative.\nNormative moral relativists believe not only the meta-ethical thesis, but that it has normative implications on what we ought to do. Normative moral relativists argue that meta-ethical relativism implies that we \"ought\" to tolerate the behavior of others even when it runs counter to our personal or cultural moral standards. Most philosophers do not agree, partially because of the challenges of arriving at an \"ought\" from relativistic premises. Meta-ethical relativism seems to eliminate the normative relativist's ability to make prescriptive claims. In other words, normative relativism may find it difficult to make a statement like \"we think it is moral to tolerate behaviour\" without always adding \"other people think \"intolerance\" of certain behaviours is moral\". Some philosophers even argue that intolerance is, to some degree, important. As Russell Blackford puts it, \"we need not adopt a quietism about moral traditions that cause hardship and suffering. Nor need we passively accept the moral norms of our own respective societies, to the extent that they are ineffective or counterproductive or simply unnecessary\". That is, it is perfectly reasonable (and practical) for a person or group to defend their subjective values against others, even if there is no universal prescription or morality. We can also criticize other cultures for failing to pursue even \"their own goals\" effectively.\nThe moral relativists may also still try to make sense of non-universal statements like \"in this country, it is wrong to do X\" or even \"to me, it is right to do Y\".\nMoral universalists argue further that their system often \"does\" justify tolerance, and that disagreement with moral systems does not always demand interference, and certainly not aggressive interference. For example, the utilitarian might call another society's practice 'ignorant' or 'less moral', but there would still be much debate about courses of action (e.g. whether to focus on providing better education, or technology, etc.).\nHistory.\nMoral relativism encompasses views and arguments that people in various cultures have held over several thousand years. For example, the ancient Jaina Anekantavada principle of Mahavira (c. 599\u2013527 BC) states that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth; and the Greek philosopher Protagoras (c. 481\u2013420 BC) famously asserted that \"man is the measure of all things\". The Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484\u2013420 BC) observed that each society regards its own belief system and way of doing things as better than all others. Sextus Empiricus and other ancient Pyrrhonist philosophers denied the existence of objective morality.\nIn the early modern era Baruch Spinoza (1632\u20131677) notably held that nothing is inherently good or evil. The 18th-century Enlightenment philosopher David Hume (1711\u20131776) serves in several important respects as the father both of modern emotivism and of moral relativism, though Hume himself did not espouse relativism. He distinguished between matters of fact and matters of value, and suggested that moral judgments consist of the latter, for they do not deal with verifiable facts obtained in the world, but only with our sentiments and passions. But Hume regarded some of our sentiments as universal. He famously denied that morality has any objective standard, and suggested that the universe remains indifferent to our preferences and our troubles.\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) believed that we have to assess the value of our values since values are relative to one's goals and one's self. He emphasized the need to analyze our moral values and how much impact they may have on us. The problem with morality, according to Nietzsche, is that those who were considered \"good\" were the powerful nobles who had more education, and considered themselves better than anyone below their rank. Thus, what is considered good is relative. A \"good man\" is not questioned on whether or not there is a \"bad\", such as temptations, lingering inside him and he is considered to be more important than a man who is considered \"bad\" who is considered useless to making the human race better because of the morals we have subjected ourselves to. But since what is considered good and bad is relative, the importance and value we place on them should also be relative. He proposed that morality itself could be a danger. Nietzsche believed that morals should be constructed actively, making them relative to who we are and what we, as individuals, consider to be true, equal, good and bad, etc. instead of reacting to moral laws made by a certain group of individuals in power.\nOne scholar, supporting an anti-realist interpretation, concludes that \"Nietzsche's central argument for anti-realism about value is explanatory: moral facts don't figure in the 'best explanation' of experience, and so are not real constituents of the objective world. Moral values, in short, can be 'explained away.'\"\nIt is certain that Nietzsche criticizes Plato's prioritization of transcendence as the Forms. The Platonist view holds that what is 'true', or most real, is something which is other-worldly while the (real) world of experience is like a mere 'shadow' of the Forms, most famously expressed in Plato's allegory of the cave. Nietzsche believes that this transcendence also had a parallel growth in Christianity, which prioritized life-denying moral qualities such as humility and obedience through the church. (See \"Beyond Good and Evil\", \"On the Genealogy of Morals\", \"The Twilight of the Idols\", \"The Antichrist\", etc.)\nAnthropologists such as Ruth Benedict (1887\u20131948) have cautioned observers against ethnocentricism\u2014using the standards of their own culture to evaluate their subjects of study. Benedict said that transcendent morals do not exist\u2014only socially constructed customs do (\"see\" cultural relativism); and that in comparing customs, the anthropologist \"insofar as he remains an anthropologist ... is bound to avoid any weighting of one in favor of the other\". To some extent, the increasing body of knowledge of great differences in belief among societies caused both social scientists and philosophers to question whether any objective, absolute standards pertaining to values could exist. This led some to posit that differing systems have equal validity, with no standard for adjudicating among conflicting beliefs. The Finnish philosopher-anthropologist Edward Westermarck (1862\u20131939) ranks as one of the first to formulate a detailed theory of moral relativism. He portrayed all moral ideas as subjective judgments that reflect one's upbringing. He rejected G.E. Moore's (1873\u20131958) ethical intuitionism\u2014in vogue during the early part of the 20th century, and which identified moral propositions as true or false, and known to us through a special faculty of intuition\u2014because of the obvious differences in beliefs among societies, which he said provided evidence of the lack of any innate, intuitive power.\nArguments for meta-ethical relativism.\nScientific.\nMorality and evolution.\nResearch within evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, ethology, and evolutionary anthropology has claimed that morality is a natural phenomenon that was shaped by evolutionary mechanisms. In this case, morality is defined as the set of relative social practices that promote the survival and successful reproduction of the species, or even multiple cooperating species.\nLiterary.\nThe literary perspectivism begins at the different versions of the Greek myths. Symbolism created multiple suggestions for a verse. Structuralism teaches us the polysemy of the poems.\nExamples of relativistic literary works: Gogol's \"Dead Souls\"; \"The Alexandria Quartet\" by Lawrence Durrell; Raymond Queneau's \"Zazie dans le m\u00e9tro\".\nCriticisms of meta-ethical relativism.\nPhilosophical.\nR. M. Hare.\nSome philosophers, for example R. M. Hare (1919\u20132002), argue that moral propositions remain subject to human logical rules, notwithstanding the absence of any factual content, including those subject to cultural or religious standards or norms. Thus, for example, they contend that one cannot hold contradictory ethical judgments. This allows for moral discourse with shared standards, notwithstanding the descriptive properties or truth conditions of moral terms. They do not affirm or deny that moral facts exist, only that human logic applies to our moral assertions; consequently, they postulate an objective and preferred standard of moral justification, albeit in a very limited sense. Nevertheless, according to Hare, human logic shows the error of relativism in one very important sense (see Hare's \"Sorting out Ethics\"). Hare and other philosophers also point out that, aside from logical constraints, all systems treat certain moral terms alike in an evaluative sense. This parallels our treatment of other terms such as \"less\" or \"more\", which meet with universal understanding and do not depend upon independent standards (for example, one can convert measurements). It applies to good and bad when used in their non-moral sense, too; for example, when we say, \"this is a \"good\" wrench\" or \"this is a \"bad\" wheel\". This evaluative property of certain terms also allows people of different beliefs to have meaningful discussions on moral questions, even though they may disagree about certain \"facts\".\nWalter Terence Stace.\n\"Ethical Relativity\" is the topic of the first two chapters in \"The Concept of Morals\", in which Walter Terence Stace argues against moral absolutism, but for moral universalism.\nPhilosophical poverty.\nCritics propose that moral relativism fails because it rejects basic premises of discussions on morality, or because it cannot arbitrate disagreement. Many critics, including Ibn Warraq and Eddie Tabash, have suggested that meta-ethical relativists essentially take themselves out of any discussion of normative morality, since they seem to be rejecting an assumption of such discussions: the premise that there are right and wrong answers that can be discovered through reason. Practically speaking, such critics will argue that meta-ethical relativism may amount to moral nihilism, or else incoherence.\nThese critics argue specifically that the moral relativists reduce the extent of their input in normative moral discussions to either rejecting the very having of the discussion, or else deeming both disagreeing parties to be correct. For instance, the moral relativist can only appeal to preference to object to the practice of murder or torture by individuals for hedonistic pleasure. This accusation that relativists reject widely held terms of discourse is similar to arguments used against other \"discussion-stoppers\" like some forms of solipsism or the rejection of induction.\nPhilosopher Simon Blackburn made a similar criticism, and explains that moral relativism fails as a \"moral system\" simply because it cannot arbitrate disagreements.\nOther criticism.\nSome arguments come when people question which moral justifications or truths are said to be relative. Because people belong to many groups based on culture, race, religion, etc., it is difficult to claim that the values of the group have authority for the members. A part of meta-ethical relativism is identifying which group of people those truths are relative to. Another component is that many people belong to more than one group. The beliefs of the groups that a person belongs to may be fundamentally different, and so it is hard to decide which are relative and which win out. A person practicing meta-ethical relativism would not necessarily object to either view, but develop an opinion and argument.\nReligious.\nRoman Catholicism.\nCatholic and some secular intellectuals attribute the perceived post-war decadence of Europe to the displacement of absolute values by moral relativism. Pope Benedict XVI, Marcello Pera and others have argued that after about 1960, Europeans massively abandoned many traditional norms rooted in Christianity and replaced them with continuously evolving relative moral rules. In this view, sexual activity has become separated from procreation, which led to a decline in the importance of families and to depopulation. The most authoritative response to moral relativism from the Catholic perspective can be found in \"Veritatis Splendor\", an encyclical by Pope John Paul II. Many of the main criticisms of moral relativism by the Catholic Church relate largely to modern controversies, such as elective abortion.\nBuddhism.\nBhikkhu Bodhi, an American Buddhist monk, has written: \nBy assigning value and spiritual ideals to private subjectivity, the materialistic world view ... threatens to undermine any secure objective foundation for morality. The result is the widespread moral degeneration that we witness today. To counter this tendency, mere moral exhortation is insufficient. If morality is to function as an efficient guide to conduct, it cannot be propounded as a self-justifying scheme but must be embedded in a more comprehensive spiritual system which grounds morality in a transpersonal order. Religion must affirm, in the clearest terms, that morality and ethical values are not mere decorative frills of personal opinion, not subjective superstructure, but intrinsic laws of the cosmos built into the heart of reality.\nViews commonly confused with moral relativism.\nMoral relativism vs ethical subjectivism.\nMoral relativism is a distinct position from ethical subjectivism (the view that the truth of ethical claims are not mind independent). While these views are often held together, they do not entail each other. For example, someone who claims \"something is morally right for me to do because the people in my culture think it is right\" is both a moral relativist (because what is right and wrong depends on who is doing it), and an ethical subjectivist (because what is right and wrong is determined by mental states, i.e. what people think is right and wrong).\nHowever, someone who thinks that what is right and wrong is whatever a deity thinks is right or wrong would be a subjectivist (morality is based on mental states), but not a relativist (morality is the same for everyone). In contrast, someone who claims that to act ethically you must follow the laws of your country would be a relativist (morality is dependent on who you are), but not a subjectivist (morality is based on facts about the world, not mental states).\nMoral relativism vs moral anti-realism.\nDepending on how a moral relativist position is constructed, it may or may not be independent of moral realism. Moral realists are committed to some version of the following three claims:\nWhile many moral relativists deny one or more of these claims, and therefore could be moral anti-realists, a denial is not required. A moral relativist who claims that you should act according to the laws in whatever country you are a citizen of, accepts all three claims: moral facts express propositions that can be true or false (you can see if a given action is against the law or not), some moral propositions are true (some actions abide by the laws in someone's country), and moral facts are ordinary (laws are not mental states, they are physical objects in the world). However, this view is a relativist one as it is dependent on the country you are a citizen of.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48055", "revid": "49032093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48055", "title": "Argument from nonbelief", "text": "Philosophical argument that asserts an inconsistency with nonbelief and God's existence\nAn argument from nonbelief is a philosophical argument for the nonexistence of God that asserts an inconsistency between God's existence and a world that fails to recognize such an entity. It is similar to the classic argument from evil in affirming an inconsistency between the world that exists and the world that would exist if God had certain desires combined with the power to see them through.\nThere are two key varieties of the argument. The argument from reasonable nonbelief (or the argument from divine hiddenness) was first elaborated in J. L. Schellenberg's 1993 book \"Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason\". This argument says that if God existed (and was perfectly good and loving) every reasonable person would have been brought to believe in God; however, there are reasonable nonbelievers; therefore, this God does not exist.\nTheodore Drange subsequently developed the argument from nonbelief, based on the mere existence of nonbelief in God. Drange considers the distinction between reasonable (by which Schellenberg means inculpable) and unreasonable (culpable) nonbelief to be irrelevant and confusing. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of academic discussion is concerned with Schellenberg's formulation.\nHistorical references to the problem of divine hiddenness.\nThe theme of divine hiddenness, silence or darkness has a long history in Judeo-Christian and Islamic theology. The roots of the Judeo-Christian description of God as hidden are in the Bible, for example in the Psalms, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?...I cry by day, but you do not answer...\", and in Isaiah: \"Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.\"\nOne of the first philosophers to write on the theme of divine hiddenness was Anselm of Canterbury, who in his \"Proslogion\" links it to an existential or spiritual concern:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDaniel Howard-Snyder and Paul Moser, in the introduction to a volume of papers on the idea of divine hiddenness as evidence against theism, cite Nietzsche's question as anticipating this contemporary theme: \"a god who is all-knowing and all-powerful and who does not even make sure his creatures understand his intentions\u2014could that be a god of goodness?\"\nSchellenberg's hiddenness argument.\nDiscussion of Schellenberg's argument has made explicit a non-theological use of the term 'hiddenness', which is now commonly used simply as a way of talking about the subjective condition of nonbelief in God. In his first presentation of the argument Schellenberg emphasized inculpable or reasonable nonbelief, but he has since shifted to speaking more specifically about nonresistant nonbelief. The first presentation is often given by commentators as follows, based on Schellenberg's own summing up:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;# If there is a God, he is perfectly loving.\nSchellenberg has stated that this formulation is misleading, when taken on its own, because it does not make explicit the reason why a perfectly loving God would want to prevent nonbelief. His deepest claim, he says, is \"about the connection between love and openness to relationship\u2014a personal and positively meaningful and explicit sort of relationship of the sort that logically presupposes each party's belief in the other's existence.\" A later presentation of the argument by Schellenberg, which aims at accessibility for students, includes this element:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;# If no perfectly loving God exists, then God does not exist.\nIn an article revisiting the argument ten years after it was originally proposed, Schellenberg observes that criticism has mainly centered around the idea that God would prevent inculpable nonbelief. He asserts that there are relatively few criticisms questioning the existence of inculpable nonbelief, and almost no theistic philosopher objects to the idea that God is perfectly loving.\nGod is perfectly loving.\nSchellenberg says he has not seen any serious objections to this premise by theistic philosophers, but there certainly are other conceptions of God. Daniel Howard-Snyder writes about the possibility of believing in an unsurpassably great personal god that is nevertheless dispassionate towards its creatures. Drawing on the Stoic concept of Eudaimonia, he says one can think of a god more akin to a wise sage than the loving parent that Schellenberg envisions.\nTheodore Drange, in his attempt to improve the argument (see below), states that there are many theists who do not view God as perfectly loving, and \"some Christians think of him as an angry deity bent on punishing people for their sins.\" Drange concludes that the argument should be put forward only in relation to theists who already accept the first premise and believe in a god who is perfectly loving.\nMost theists, in fact, do admit that love is a central concept in almost all of the world's religions. God is often directly associated with love, especially with agape. Theologians such as N.T. Wright suggest that our experience of love is itself a proof of God's existence. However, there are a few others (e.g. Brian Davies in the Thomist tradition) who suggest that the modern interpretation of what it means to say God loves human beings is incorrect, and so that God is able to be loving in a sense while actually willing disbelief.\nNonresistant nonbelief, lack of evidence, and sin.\nWhen asked what he would say when facing God on judgment day, Bertrand Russell famously replied that he would say \"Not enough evidence, God! Not enough evidence!\" Some nonbelievers may have hidden from themselves what seems to them to be possible evidence of the divine, but the view of the hiddenness argument is that others have tried hard to believe in God. Schellenberg addresses this difference with his distinction between culpable and \"inculpable\" nonbelief, with the latter defined as \"non-belief that exists through no fault of the non-believer.\"\nHistorically, the Calvinist tradition has placed the blame on nonbelievers, who are predestined by God towards nonbelief. Calvin's religious epistemology is based on the \"sensus divinitatis\" (Sense of Divinity), the view that the presence of God is universally perceived by all humans. Paul Helm explains, \"Calvin\u2019s use of the term 'sense' signals that the knowledge of God is a common human endowment; mankind is created not only as capable of knowing God, but as actually knowing him.\" According to this tradition, there is no inculpable or nonresistant nonbelief. Jonathan Edwards, the 18th century American theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of \"true benevolence\", a divinely gifted willingness to be open to the truth about God. Thus, the failure of non-believers to see \"divine things\" is in his view due to \"a dreadful stupidity of mind, occasioning a sottish insensibility of their truth and importance.\"\nDemographics of theism and the problem of natural nonbelief.\nIn modern times, there are fewer proponents of these views. One reason is that, as Stephen Maitzen argues, anthropology has long established that while religious belief in general is essentially universal, belief in what Calvin would recognize as God is very unevenly distributed among cultures (consider for example God in Buddhism, Jain cosmology, or non-theistic animism). If God exists, then why, Maitzen asks, does the prevalence of belief in God vary so dramatically with cultural and national boundaries? Jason Marsh has extended this kind of demographic challenge by focusing on human evolution and cognitive science of religion. Why is theistic belief apparently non-existent among early humans but common at later times, at least in some regions? According to Marsh, the hiddenness problem is harder to answer once we appreciate that much nonbelief is 'natural', owing to the kinds of minds people naturally possess and to their place in evolutionary and cultural history.\nAnother reason why many philosophers no longer attribute nonbelief to human sinfulness has to do with respect. In fact, modern critics, such as Howard-Snyder, who praised Schellenberg's book for being \"religiously sensitive,\" are similarly sensitive towards the nonbeliever. Howard-Snyder wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWould a perfectly loving God prevent nonresistant nonbelief?\nThe most serious criticisms of the hiddenness argument have been leveled against the idea that a perfectly loving God would prevent nonresistant nonbelief. Schellenberg argues in two steps, by first claiming that a loving God would enable humans to partake in a relationship with it, and then, assuming that belief in that god is a necessary condition for such relationships to occur, inferring that a loving God would not permit nonbelief. He states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe justifies this claim by arguing that a conception of divine love can best be formed by extrapolating the best aspects of love in human relations, and draws an analogy with perfect parental love:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The perfectly loving parent, for example, from the time the child can first respond to her at all until death separates them, will, insofar as she can help it, see to it that nothing \"she\" does ever puts relationship with herself out of reach for her child.\nBut, says Schellenberg, belief in God's existence is necessary for engaging in such a meaningful relationship with God. He therefore concludes that if there is a perfectly loving God, such creatures will always believe in it. He further argues that since belief is involuntary, these creatures should always have evidence \"causally sufficient\" for such belief:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nObjections and counterarguments.\nSkeptical theism.\nSkeptical theism is the view that we should remain skeptical of claims that our perceptions about God's purposes can reasonably be considered good evidence of what they are. The central thesis of skeptical theism is that it would not be surprising for an infinitely intelligent and knowledgeable being's reasons for permitting a perception of evil or alleged hiddenness to be beyond human comprehension.[2] That is, what is perceived as hiddenness may be necessary for a greater good or to prevent equal or even greater evils.\nSchellenberg has responded to skeptical theism (i.e. noseeum/unknown-purpose defense). First, Schellenberg says that he has given known reasons to think that a perfectly loving being would always be open to a personal relationship; ipso facto, God would not sacrifice some time in the relationship for the sake of unknown greater goods, and if the greatest good for finite creatures is to be in a relationship with God, then God would not sacrifice that for the sake of unknown greater goods. Finally, Schellenberg's position is that all known and unknown goods are ultimately in God; hence, God can bring about unknown greater goods without hiddenness.\nNoseeum defense.\nThe philosophers Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea described the philosopher William Rowe's justification for the second premise of the argument from evil, which is equally applicable to a perception of hiddenness:Some evidential arguments ... rely on a \u201cnoseeum\u201d inference of the following sort: NI: If, after thinking hard, we can\u2019t think of any God-justifying reason for permitting some horrific evil then it is likely that there is no such reason. (The reason NI is called a \u2018noseeum\u2019 inference is that it says, more or less, that because we don\u2019t see \u2018um, they probably ain\u2019t there.)Various analogies are offered to show that the noseeum inference is logically unsound. For example, a novice chess player's inability to discern a chess master's choice of moves cannot be used to infer that there is no good reason for the move. The skeptical theist and noseeum defense place the burden of proof on the atheist to prove that their intuitions about God are trustworthy.\nUnreasonable demands on God.\nThis argument is sometimes seen as demanding God to prove his existence, for example by performing miracles. Critics have argued that even in Schellenberg's more refined version, the nonbeliever is imposing their own epistemological expectations on the will of God. A detailed discussion of these kinds of demands, and their moral and spiritual implications, is provided by Paul Moser, who says that such demands amount to cognitive idolatry. He defines idolatry as \"our not letting the true God be Lord in our lives\" and instead committing to something other than God by pursuing a quest for self-realization in our own terms. If this is idolatry in our actions, then idolatry in our knowing, he says, is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cognitive idolatry relies on a standard for knowledge that excludes the primacy of the morally self-transforming knowledge of God central to knowing God as Lord. It rests on an epistemological standard, whether empiricist, rationalist, or some hybrid, that does not let God be Lord. Such idolatry aims to protect one's lifestyle from serious challenge by the God who calls, convicts, and reconciles. It disallows knowledge of God as personal subject and Lord to whom we are morally and cognitively responsible. It allows at most for knowledge of God as an undemanding object of human knowledge.\nSchellenberg considers this criticism irrelevant to the argument, which in his opinion, does not impose any demands for demonstrations of God's power, but rather looks for evidence that \"need only be such as will be causally sufficient for belief in the absence of resistance... This result might be effected through the much more spiritually appropriate means of religious experience, interpreted in the sensitive manner of a Pascal or a Kierkegaard.\" Schellenberg then expresses a certain frustration that theistic writers who otherwise extol the value of religious experiences deny non-theists the right to do so.\nSoul-making theodicy.\nJohn Hick used the term \"soul-making\" in his theodicy \"Evil and the God of Love\" to describe the kind of spiritual development that he believes justifies the existence of evil. This defense is employed by Michael Murray, who explains how, in his view, divine hiddenness is essential to soul-making. It may seem that it is not hard to imagine a world where God is known and yet believers act freely with ample opportunities for spiritual development. But Murray gives a deep and careful analysis of the argument, concluding that if God's existence were revealed in such a way as to remove reasonable non-belief, then \"any desire that we might have to believe or act in ways contrary to that which has been revealed would be overwhelmed.\"\nCritics note here that, for example, in Christianity (and even more in Judaism, where God is represented as talking to Job and explaining why he is just), God is already believed to have exposed himself very distinctly: for example to the Apostles who saw his resurrection. One theistic explanation of this might be that God knows some people would not believe anyway but if God knows this before creating, there is a problem about God's liability for what is created. More fundamentally in relation to Murray's argument, there is the problem for orthodox believers of explaining the existence of Satan, a fallen angel who is obviously aware of God and yet, according to theistic scriptures, freely chose to rebel against God.\nTurning the tables.\nLike with the argument from evil, one can \"flip\" the argument from divine hiddenness. In other words, one can argue that the fact that many or most people believe that God exists (and/or have experiences of God) is evidence that God \"does\" exist.\nUnknown purpose defense.\nAlvin Plantinga writes that the statement \"We can see no good reason for God to do X\" only implies \"There is no good reason for God to do X\" on the assumption that \"If there were a good reason for God to do X, we would be able to see it,\" which he suggests is absurd. This point might be applied to versions of the argument from nonbelief that suggest without support that there is no good reason for God to permit nonbelief. Critics of Plantinga might suggest that if nobody is able to present an apparently good reason for God to allow nonbelief, then it is less ad hoc to merely posit God's non-existence, or indifference to people's belief, to explain this inability, than to posit both the existence of a God who cares about people's beliefs as well as some unthinkable reason obvious only to God to remain hidden.\nThere really are no atheists defense.\nThis argument posits that all true atheists are, at their core, lying in order to live in a way that contradicts God's commands, as seen in certain interpretations of Romans 1:18-25. Critics point out that there are atheists who are genuinely not lying and are not using their atheism as an excuse to sin. However, proponents argue that atheists could still be deceiving themselves, even if they are not lying to others (for example, the argument about loving the wrong woman, which may need further clarification). Some have suggested that this argument overlooks Stephen Maitzen's point regarding the demographics of theism: if all atheists are liars, why are people in some societies more likely to lie than in others? Additionally, others contend that the argument fails to address Jason Marsh's point about natural nonbelief in early humans. Since it is plausible that natural nonbelief existed in early humans, it doesn't make sense to claim that such nonbelief is self-deceptive. Natural nonbelief, they argue, entails nonresistant nonbelief.\nDrange's argument from nonbelief.\nTheodore Drange proposed a version of the nonbelief argument in 1996. He considers the distinction between culpable and inculpable nonbelief to be unhelpful in the argument, arguing instead that the mere existence of nonbelief is evidence against the existence of God. A semi-formal presentation of the argument is as follows:\nDrange's argument is directed primarily to Christians, and the philosopher Laura Garcia has replied from that perspective. She says that Drange's argument hinges on the idea that belief in God's existence is, according to Christians, necessary for salvation. According to Garcia this idea is mistaken: \"many Christians deny this claim and the Catholic Church explicitly rejects it.\" But as Garcia notes, Drange has answered that for many Christians\u2014in particular, evangelical Christians\u2014his point should remain convincing, and that there are in any case other good things that belief in God can bring for humans, which a good God would desire, such as peace of mind and a sense of meaning in life.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one example of representations of integers based on Fibonacci numbers. Each code word ends with \"11\" and contains no other instances of \"11\" before the end.\nThe Fibonacci code is closely related to the Zeckendorf representation, a positional numeral system that uses Zeckendorf's theorem and has the property that no number has a representation with consecutive 1s. The Fibonacci code word for a particular integer is exactly the integer's Zeckendorf representation with the order of its digits reversed and an additional \"1\" appended to the end.\nDefinition.\nFor a number formula_1, if formula_2 represent the digits of the code word representing formula_1 then we have:\n formula_4\nwhere \"F\"(\"i\") is the \"i\"th Fibonacci number, and so \"F\"(\"i\"+2) is the \"i\"th distinct Fibonacci number starting with formula_5. The last bit formula_6 is always an appended bit of 1 and does not carry place value.\nIt can be shown that such a coding is unique, and the only occurrence of \"11\" in any code word is at the end (that is, \"d\"(\"k\"\u22121) and \"d\"(\"k\")). The penultimate bit is the most significant bit and the first bit is the least significant bit. Also, leading zeros cannot be omitted as they can be in, for example, decimal numbers.\nThe first few Fibonacci codes are shown below, and also their so-called \"implied probability\", the value for each number that has a minimum-size code in Fibonacci coding.\nTo encode an integer N:\nTo decode a code word, remove the final \"1\", assign the remaining the values 1,2,3,5,8,13... (the Fibonacci numbers) to the bits in the code word, and sum the values of the \"1\" bits.\nComparison with other universal codes.\nFibonacci coding has a useful property that sometimes makes it attractive in comparison to other universal codes: it is an example of a self-synchronizing code, making it easier to recover data from a damaged stream. With most other universal codes, if a single bit is altered, then none of the data that comes after it will be correctly read. With Fibonacci coding, on the other hand, a changed bit may cause one token to be read as two, or cause two tokens to be read incorrectly as one, but reading a \"0\" from the stream will stop the errors from propagating further. Since the only stream that has no \"0\" in it is a stream of \"11\" tokens, the total edit distance between a stream damaged by a single bit error and the original stream is at most three.\nThis approach, encoding using sequence of symbols, in which some patterns (like \"11\") are forbidden, can be freely generalized.\nExample.\nThe following table shows that the number 65 is represented in Fibonacci coding as 0100100011, since 65 = 2 + 8 + 55. The first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) are not used, and an additional 1 is always appended.\nformula_7\nGeneralizations.\nThe Fibonacci encodings for the positive integers are binary strings that end with \"11\" and contain no other instances of \"11\". This can be generalized to binary strings that end with \"N\" consecutive 1s and contain no other instances of \"N\" consecutive 1s. For instance, for \"N\"\u00a0=\u00a03 the positive integers are encoded as 111, 0111, 00111, 10111, 000111, 100111, 010111, 110111, 0000111, 1000111, 0100111, \u2026. In this case, the number of encodings as a function of string length is given by the sequence of tribonacci numbers.\nFor general constraints defining which symbols are allowed after a given symbol, the maximal information rate can be obtained by first finding the optimal transition probabilities using a maximal entropy random walk, then using an entropy coder (with switched encoder and decoder) to encode a message as a sequence of symbols fulfilling the found optimal transition probabilities.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has aired on the United States national public television provider PBS since its debut, with its first run moving to premium channel HBO on January 16, 2016, then its sister streaming service HBO Max on November 12, 2020, and most recently Netflix on November 10, 2025.\nThe show's format consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques that have evolved to reflect changes in American culture and audiences' viewing habits. It was the first children's TV show to use educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content, and the first show whose educational effects were formally studied. Its format and content have undergone significant changes over the years to reflect changes to its curriculum.\nShortly after its creation, its producers developed what came to be called the CTW Model (after the production company's previous name), a system of planning, production, and evaluation based on collaboration between producers, writers, educators, and researchers. The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements, international sales, and other media. By 2006, independently produced versions (co-productions) of \"Sesame Street\" were broadcast in 20 countries. In 2001, there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of \"Sesame Street\"; and by its 40th anniversary in 2009, it was broadcast in more than 140 countries.\nSince its debut, \"Sesame Street\" has garnered widespread acclaim, and it is considered one of the greatest television series of all time. It was by then the 15th-highest-rated children's television show in the United States. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched it by the time they were three. In 2018, it was estimated that 86 million Americans had watched it as children. As of 2022, it has won 222 Emmy Awards and 11 Grammy Awards, more than any other children's show. \"Sesame Street\" remains one of the longest-running shows in the world.\nHistory.\n\"Sesame Street\" was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and Carnegie Foundation vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children's television show that would \"master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them,\" such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of US$8million ($ million in 2024 dollars) from the Carnegie Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the U.S. federal government to create and produce a new children's television show.\n\"Sesame Street\" was officially announced at a press conference on May 6, 1969. Joan Ganz Cooney, Children's Television Workshop's executive director, said that \"Sesame Street\" would use the techniques of commercial television programs to teach young children. Live shorts and animated cartoons would teach young children the alphabet, numbers, vocabulary, shapes, and basic reasoning skills. By repeating concepts throughout an episode, young children's interest would be held while they learn the concepts. Guest cameos would help attract older children and adults. Cooney said that the name \"Sesame Street\" came from the saying \"open sesame\", which gives the idea of a place where exciting things occur. The show was given an initial six-month run to determine whether it was effective and would continue to air.\nThe program premiered on public television stations on November 10, 1969. It was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents and production values on laboratory and formative research. Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy, and high ratings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI've always said of our original team that developed and produced \"Sesame Street\": Collectively, we were a genius.\n \u2014\u200a\"Sesame Street\" creator Joan Ganz Cooney\nAccording to writer Michael Davis, by the mid-1970s, the show had become \"an American institution.\" The cast and crew expanded during this time, with emphasis on the hiring of women crew members and the addition of minorities to the cast. The show's success continued into the 1980s. In 1981, when the federal government withdrew its funding, CTW turned to and expanded other revenue sources, including its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing, and foreign broadcast income. Its curriculum has expanded to include more affective topics such as relationships, ethics, and emotions. Many of its storylines have been inspired by the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew\u2014most notably, the 1982 death of Will Lee, who played Mr. Hooper; and the marriage of Luis and Maria in 1988.\nBy the end of the 1990s, the show faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in young children's viewing habits, competition from other shows, the development of cable television, and a drop in ratings. As the 21st century began, the show made major changes. Starting in 2002, its format became more narrative-focused and included ongoing storylines. After its 30th anniversary in 1999, due to the popularity of the Muppet Elmo, the show also incorporated a popular segment known as \"Elmo's World\". In 2009, the show won the Outstanding Achievement Emmy for its then 40 years on the air.\nIn late 2015, in response to \"sweeping changes in the media business\" and as part of a five-year programming and development deal, premium television service HBO began airing first-run episodes of \"Sesame Street\". The episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. The deal allowed Sesame Workshop to produce more episodes\u2014increasing from 18 to 35 per season\u2014and to create a spinoff series with the \"Sesame Street\" Muppets, and a new educational series.\nAt its 50th anniversary in 2019, \"Sesame Street\" had produced over 4,500 episodes, two feature-length movies (\"\" in 1985 and \"The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland\" in 1999), 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Beginning that year, digitized versions of the show's full archive of episodes were donated to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, viewable on site at the library's locations, with five episodes available for viewing online. Its YouTube channel has over 24 million subscribers. It was announced in October 2019 that first-run episodes will move to HBO Max beginning with the show's 51st season in 2020. In August 2022, HBO Max removed 200 older episodes of the series from its library after initially offering around 650 episodes. On December 13, 2024, it was announced that Max would not be renewing their contract to make episodes of \"Sesame Street\", meaning 2025 would be the last year for episodes made with Max. Episodes will be in the HBO Max streaming library until 2027. A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop stated: \"We will continue to invest in our best-in-class programming and look forward to announcing our new distribution plans in the coming months, ensuring that 'Sesame Street' reaches as many children as possible for generations to come.\"\nOn May 19, 2025, it was announced that \"Sesame Street\" would begin to air new episodes on Netflix worldwide and would once again premiere episodes on PBS, with new episodes being released on both platforms on the same day, as well as past seasons. This move would also include the acquisition of 90 hours of older episodes by Netflix. Season 56 of \"Sesame Street\" premiered on Netflix and PBS on November 10, 2025. Beginning in January 2026, under a new agreement, the official YouTube channel is expected to host the largest collection of older library episodes.\nFormat.\nFrom its first episode, \"Sesame Street\"'s format has utilized \"a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music,\" as well as animation and live-action short films. When it premiered, most researchers believed that young children did not have long attention spans, and the show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their attention. At first, its \"street scenes\"\u2014the action recorded on its set\u2014consisted of character-driven interactions. Rather than ongoing stories, they were written as individual, curriculum-based segments interrupted by \"inserts\" of puppet sketches, short films and animations. This structure allowed producers to use a mixture of styles and characters, and to vary its pace, presumably keeping it interesting to young viewers. However, by season 20, research showed that children were able to follow a story\u2014and the street scenes, while still interspersed with other segments, became evolving storylines.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe basically deconstructed the show. It's not a magazine format anymore. It's more like the \"Sesame\" hour. Children will be able to navigate through it easier.\n\u2014\u200aExecutive producer Arlene Sherman, speaking of the show's restructuring in 2002\nOn recommendations by child psychologists, the producers initially decided that the show's human actors and Muppets would not interact because they were concerned it would confuse young children. When CTW tested the new show, they found that children paid attention during the Muppet segments and that their interest was lost during the \"Street\" segments. They requested that Henson and his team create Muppets such as Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch to interact with the human actors, and the Street segments were re-shot.\n\"Sesame Street\"'s format remained intact until the 2000s when the changing audience required that producers move to a more narrative format. In 1998, the popular \"Elmo's World,\" a 15-minute-long segment hosted by the Muppet Elmo, was created. Starting in 2014, during the show's 45th season, the producers introduced a half-hour version of the program. The new version, which originally complemented the full-hour series, was broadcast weekday afternoons and streamed on the Internet. In 2017, in response to the changing viewing habits of toddlers, the show's producers retired the full-hour version across all its broadcast platforms. The new half-hour version featured fewer characters, reduced pop culture references \"once included as winks for their parents\", and focused \"on a single backbone topic.\"\nOn October 30, 2023, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" announced that \"Sesame Street\" would be reimagined by completely dropping the half-hour magazine-style format of the long-running children's show in favor of a longer narrative-driven style and more live action Muppet puppet characters. The new format took effect in Season 56, which premiered on November 10, 2025, alongside a new animated series, \"Tales from 123\".\nEducational goals.\nCanadian author Malcolm Gladwell has said that \"\"Sesame Street\" was built around a single, breakthrough insight: that if you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them.\" Gerald S. Lesser, the CTW's first advisory board chair, went even further, saying that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention. \"Sesame Street\" was the first children's show to structure each episode, and the segments within them, to capture children's attention, and to make, as Gladwell put it, \"small but critical adjustments\" to keep it. According to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch, it was one of the few children's shows to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, garnered from formative and summative research.\n\"Sesame Street\"'s creators and researchers formulated both cognitive and affective goals for the show. They initially focused on cognitive goals, while addressing affective goals indirectly, believing it would increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency. One of their primary goals was preparing young children for school, especially children from low-income families, using modeling, repetition, and humor. They adjusted its content to increase viewers' attention and the show's appeal, and encouraged older children and parents to \"co-view\" it by including more sophisticated humor, cultural references, and celebrity guests; by 2019, 80% of parents watched \"Sesame Street\" with their children, and 650 celebrities had appeared on the show.\nDuring \"Sesame Street\"'s first season, some critics felt that it should address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. The show's creators and producers responded by featuring these themes in interpersonal disputes between its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated real-life experiences of its cast and crew, including the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria). In later seasons, it addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.\nIn its first season, the show addressed its outreach goals by focusing on the promotion of educational materials used in preschool settings; and in subsequent seasons, by focusing on their development. Innovative programs were developed because their target audience, children and their families in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.\nStarting in 2006, Sesame Workshop expanded its outreach by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs focusing on how military deployment affects the families of servicepeople. Its outreach efforts also focused on families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety. In 2013, SW started Sesame Street in Communities, to help families dealing with difficult issues.\nFunding.\nAs a result of Cooney's initial proposal in 1968, the Carnegie Institute awarded her a $1 million grant to create a new children's television program and establish the CTW, renamed in June 2000 to Sesame Workshop (SW). Cooney and Morrisett procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, CPB, and the Ford Foundation. Davis reported that Cooney and Morrisett decided that if they did not procure full funding from the beginning, they would drop the idea of producing the show. As Lesser reported, funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic pressures experienced by commercial broadcast television networks, but created challenges in procuring future funding.\nAfter \"Sesame Street\"'s initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources. From the first season, they understood that the source of their funding, which they considered \"seed\" money, would need to be replaced. The 1970s were marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the U.S. Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024) until the last day of CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements with toy companies and other manufacturers, publishing, and international sales for their funding.\nIn 1998, the CTW accepted corporate sponsorship to raise funds for \"Sesame Street\" and other projects. For the first time, they allowed short advertisements by indoor playground manufacturer Discovery Zone, their first corporate sponsor, to air before and after each episode. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who had previously appeared on \"Sesame Street\", called for a boycott of the show, saying that the CTW was \"exploiting impressionable children.\" In 2015, in response to funding challenges, it was announced that premium television service HBO would air first-run episodes of \"Sesame Street\". Steve Youngwood, SW's Chief Operating Officer, called the move \"one of the toughest decisions we ever made.\" According to \"The New York Times\", the move \"drew an immediate backlash.\" Critics claimed that it favored privileged children over less-advantaged children and their families, the original focus of the show. They also criticized choosing to air first-run episodes on HBO, a network with adult dramas and comedies.\nProduction.\nResearch.\nProducer Joan Ganz Cooney has stated, \"Without research, there would be no \"Sesame Street\".\" In 1967, when she and her team began planning the show's development, combining research with television production was, as she put it, \"positively heretical.\" Its producers soon began developing what came to be called the CTW Model, a system of planning, production and evaluation that did not fully emerge until the end of the show's first season. According to Morrow, the Model consisted of four parts: \"the interaction of receptive television producers and child science experts, the creation of a specific and age-appropriate curriculum, research to shape the program directly, and independent measurement of viewers' learning.\"\nCooney credited the show's high standard in research procedures to Harvard professors Gerald S. Lesser, whom CTW hired to design its educational objectives; and Edward L. Palmer, who conducted the show's formative research and bridged the gap between producers and researchers. CTW conducted research in two ways: in-house formative research that informed and improved production; and independent summative evaluations, conducted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the first two seasons, which measured its educational effectiveness. Cooney said, \"From the beginning, we\u2014the planners of the project\u2014designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners.\" She characterized the collaboration as an \"arranged marriage.\"\nWriting.\n\"Sesame Street\" has used many writers in its long history. As Peter Hellman wrote in his 1987 article in \"New York Magazine\", \"The show, of course, depends upon its writers, and it isn't easy to find adults who could identify the interest level of a pre-schooler.\" Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. Norman Stiles, head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would \"burn out\" after writing about a dozen scripts. According to Gikow, \"Sesame Street\" went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that it would be easier to teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy. As Stone stated, \"Writing for children is not so easy.\" Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, \"It's not an easy show to write. You have to know the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt.\"\nThe show's research team developed an annotated document, or \"Writer's Notebook,\" which served as a bridge between the show's curriculum goals and script development. The notebook was a compilation of programming ideas designed to teach specific curriculum points, provided extended definitions of curriculum goals, and assisted the writers and producers in translating the goals into televised material. Suggestions in the notebook were free of references to specific characters and contexts on the show so that they could be implemented as openly and flexibly as possible.\nThe research team, in a series of meetings with the writers, also developed \"a curriculum sheet\" that described the show's goals and priorities for every season. After receiving the curriculum focus and goals for the season, the writers met to discuss ideas and story arcs for the characters, and an \"assignment sheet\" was created that suggested how much time was allotted for each goal and topic. When a script was completed, the show's research team analyzed it to ensure that the goals were met. Then each production department met to determine what each episode needed in terms of costumes, lights, and sets. The writers were present during the show's taping, which for the first twenty-four years of the show took place in Manhattan, and after 1992, at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens to make last-minute revisions when necessary.\nMedia.\nEarly in their history \"Sesame Street\" and the CTW began to look for alternative funding sources and turned to creating products and writing licensing agreements. They became, as Cooney put it, \"a multiple-media institution.\" In 1970, the CTW created a \"non-broadcast\" division responsible for creating and publishing books and \"Sesame Street Magazine\". By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles. The Workshop decided from the start that all materials their licensing program created would \"underscore and amplify\" the show's curriculum. In 2004, over 68% of \"Sesame Street\"'s revenue came from licenses and products such as toys and clothing. By 2008, the \"Sesame Street\" Muppets accounted for between $15 million and $17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees, split between the Sesame Workshop and The Jim Henson Company. By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had over 500 licensing agreements and had produced over 200 hours of home video. There have been two theatrically released \"Sesame Street\" movies, \"Follow That Bird\", released in 1985, and \"Elmo in Grouchland\", released in 1999. In early 2019, it was announced that a third film, a musical co-starring Anne Hathaway and written and directed by Jonathan Krisel, would be produced. In November 2019, Sesame Street announced a family friendly augmented reality application produced by Weyo in partnership with Sesame Workshop in honor of the show's 50th anniversary.\nJim Henson, the creator of the Muppets, owned the trademarks to those characters, and was reluctant to market them at first. He agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, computer games, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW and its outreach efforts. Even though Cooney and the CTW had very little experience with marketing, they demanded complete control over all products and product decisions. Any product line associated with the show had to be educational and inexpensive, and could not be advertised during the show's airings. As Davis reported, \"Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution\" in their marketing and licensing efforts.\nDirector Jon Stone, talking about the music of \"Sesame Street\", said: \"There was no other sound like it on television.\" For the first time in children's television, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum. In order to attract the best composers and lyricists, the CTW allowed songwriters like Joe Raposo, \"Sesame Street\"'s first musical director, to retain the rights to the songs they wrote, which earned them lucrative profits and helped the show sustain public interest. By 2019, there were 180 albums of \"Sesame Street\" music produced, and its songwriters had received 11 Grammys. In late 2018, the SW announced a multi-year agreement with Warner Music Group to re-launch Sesame Street Records in the U.S. and Canada. For the first time in 20 years, \"an extensive catalog of \"Sesame Street\" recordings\" was made available to the public in a variety of formats, including CD and vinyl compilations, digital streaming, and downloads.\n\"Sesame Street\" used animations and short films commissioned from outside studios, interspersed throughout each episode, to help teach their viewers basic concepts like numbers and letters. Jim Henson was one of the many producers to create short films for the show. Shortly after \"Sesame Street\" debuted in the United States, the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show at home. These versions came to be called \"co-productions.\" By 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of \"Sesame Street\", and in 2006, there were twenty co-productions around the world. By its 50th anniversary in 2019, 190 million children viewed over 160 versions of \"Sesame Street\" in 70 languages. In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of \"The New York Times\" reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million. \"Sesame Street the Musical\" opened at Theatre Row off Broadway on September 8, 2022.\nIn 2015, HBO acquired the production rights to the show, which included an agreement of exclusive rights for nine months at which point the episodes were to be given away free of charge to other networks (e.g. PBS). In December 2024, HBO announced it would part ways with \"Sesame Street\".\nCast, crew and characters.\nShortly after the CTW was created in 1968, Joan Ganz Cooney was named its first executive director. She was one of the first female executives in American television. Her appointment was called \"one of the most important television developments of the decade.\" She assembled a team of producers, all of whom had previously worked on \"Captain Kangaroo\". Jon Stone was responsible for writing, casting, and format; Dave Connell took over animation; and Sam Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team. Cameraman Frankie Biondo has worked on \"Sesame Street\" from its first episode in 1969.\nJim Henson and the Muppets' involvement in \"Sesame Street\" began when he and Cooney met at one of the curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should \"make do without puppets.\" Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join \"Sesame Street\" to meet his own social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the \"Sesame Street\" Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the CTW. As Morrow stated, Henson's puppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention. Davis reported that Henson was able to take \"arcane academic goals\" and translate them to \"effective and pleasurable viewing.\" In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. Morrow reported that the Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Sesame Street\" is best known for the creative geniuses it attracted, people like Jim Henson and Joe Raposo and Frank Oz, who intuitively grasped what it takes to get through to children. They were television's answer to Beatrix Potter or L. Frank Baum or Dr. Seuss.\n \u2014\u200aAuthor Malcolm Gladwell, \"The Tipping Point\"\nAlthough the producers decided against depending upon a single host for \"Sesame Street\", instead casting a group of ethnically diverse actors, they realized that a children's television program needed to have, as Lesser put it, \"a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities,\" both human and Muppet. Jon Stone, whose goal was to cast white actors in the minority, was responsible for hiring the show's first cast. He did not audition actors until Spring 1969, a few weeks before the five test shows were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the \"most enthusiastic thumbs up\" were cast. For example, Loretta Long was chosen to play Susan when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of \"I'm a Little Teapot.\" Stone stated that casting was the only aspect of the show that was \"just completely haphazard.\" Most of the cast and crew found jobs on \"Sesame Street\" through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers. According to puppeteer Marty Robinson in 2019, longevity was common among the show's cast and crew.\nAccording to the CTW's research, children preferred watching and listening to other children more than to puppets and adults; as such, they included children in many scenes. Dave Connell insisted that no child actors be used, so these children were non-professionals, unscripted, and spontaneous. Many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control. However, the adult cast learned to handle the children's spontaneity flexibly, even when it resulted in departures from the planned script or lesson. CTW research also revealed that the children's hesitations and on-air mistakes served as models for viewers. According to Morrow, this resulted in the show having a \"fresh quality,\" especially in its early years.\nReception.\nRatings.\nWhen \"Sesame Street\" premiered on November 10, 1969, it aired on only 67.6% of American televisions, but it earned a 3.3 Nielsen rating, which totaled 1.9 million households. By the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of 6 were watching \"Sesame Street\" daily. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners and students in first and second grade had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups.\nThe show's ratings significantly decreased in the early 1990s, due to changes in children's viewing habits and in the television marketplace. The producers responded by making large-scale structural changes to the show. By 2006, \"Sesame Street\" had become \"the most widely viewed children's television show in the world,\" with 20 international independent versions and broadcasts in over 120 countries. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old. In 2008, it was estimated that 77 million Americans had watched the series as children. By the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was ranked the fifteenth-most-popular children's show on television, and by its 50th in 2019, the show had 100% brand awareness globally. In 2018, the show was the second-highest-rated program on PBS Kids. In 2021, however, the Sesame Street documentary \"50 Years of Sunny Days,\" which was broadcast nationally on ABC, did not fare well in the ratings, scoring only approximately 2.3 million viewers.\nInfluence.\nAs of 2001[ [update]], there were over 1,000 research studies regarding \"Sesame Street\"'s efficacy, impact, and effect on American culture. The CTW solicited the Educational Testing Service (ETS) to conduct summative research on the show. ETS's two \"landmark\" summative evaluations, conducted in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that the show had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies have been cited in other studies of the effects of television on young children. Additional studies conducted throughout \"Sesame Street\"'s history demonstrated that the show continued to have a positive effect on its young viewers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Sesame Street\" [is] perhaps the most vigorously researched, vetted, and fretted-over program on the planet. It would take a fork-lift to now to haul away the load of scholarly paper devoted to the series...\n\u2014\u200aAuthor Michael Davis\nLesser believed that \"Sesame Street\" research \"may have conferred a new respectability upon the studies of the effects of visual media upon children.\" He also believed that the show had the same effect on the prestige of producing shows for children in the television industry. Historian Robert Morrow, in his book \"Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television\", which chronicled the show's influence on children's television and on the television industry as a whole, reported that many critics of commercial television saw \"Sesame Street\" as a \"straightforward illustration for reform.\" Les Brown, a writer for \"Variety\", saw in \"Sesame Street\" \"a hope for a more substantial future\" for television.\nMorrow reported that the networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many critics saw them as \"appeasement gestures.\" According to Morrow, despite the CTW Model's effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television \"made only a limited effort to emulate CTW's methods,\" and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them. By the mid-1970s commercial television had abandoned their experiments with creating better children's programming. Other critics hoped that \"Sesame Street\", with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers. It was not until the mid-1990s that another children's television educational program, \"Blue's Clues\", used the CTW's methods to create and modify their content. The creators of \"Blue's Clues\" were influenced by \"Sesame Street\", but wanted to use research conducted in the 30 years since its debut. Angela Santomero, one of its producers, said, \"We wanted to learn from \"Sesame Street\" and take it one step further.\"\nCritic Richard Roeper said that perhaps one of the strongest indicators of the influence of \"Sesame Street\" has been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially speculation concerning the sexuality of Bert and Ernie.\nCritical reception.\n\"Sesame Street\" was praised from its debut in 1969. \"Newsday\" reported that several newspapers and magazines had written \"glowing\" reports about the CTW and Cooney. The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it. In 1970, \"Sesame Street\" won twenty awards, including a Peabody Award, three Emmys, an award from the Public Relations Society of America, a Clio, and a Prix Jeunesse. By 1995, the show had won two Peabody Awards and four Parents' Choice Awards. It was the subject of a traveling exhibition by the Smithsonian Institution, and a film exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Sesame Street\" is ... with lapses, the most intelligent and important program in television. That is not anything much yet.\n \u2014\u200aRenata Adler, \"The New Yorker\", 1972\n\"Sesame Street\" was not without its detractors, however. The state commission in Mississippi, where Henson was from, operated the state's PBS member station; in May 1970 it voted to not air \"Sesame Street\" because of its \"highly [racially] integrated cast of children\" which \"the commission members felt ... Mississippi was not yet ready for.\" According to \"\", Lesser's account of the development and early years of \"Sesame Street\", there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere, but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season. Historian Robert W. Morrow speculated that much of the early criticism, which he called \"surprisingly intense,\" stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, \"the place of children in American society and the controversies about television's effects on them.\"\nAccording to Morrow, the \"most important\" studies finding negative effects of \"Sesame Street\" were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist Thomas D. Cook during its first two seasons. Social scientist and Head Start founder Urie Bronfenbrenner criticized the show for being too wholesome. Psychologist Leon Eisenberg saw \"Sesame Street\"'s urban setting as \"superficial\" and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner-city child. Head Start director Edward Zigler was probably \"Sesame Street\"'s most vocal critic in the show's early years.\nIn spite of their commitment to multiculturalism, the CTW experienced conflicts with the leadership of minority groups, especially Latino groups and feminists, who objected to \"Sesame Street\"'s depiction of Latinos and women. The CTW took steps to address their objections. By 1971, the CTW hired Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers, and by the mid-1970s, Morrow reported that \"the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words.\" As \"The New York Times\" has stated, creating strong female characters \"that make kids laugh, but not...as female stereotypes\" has been a challenge for the producers of \"Sesame Street\". According to Morrow, change regarding how women and girls were depicted on \"Sesame Street\" occurred slowly. As more female Muppet performers like Camille Bonora, Fran Brill, Pam Arciero, Carmen Osbahr, Stephanie D'Abruzzo, Jennifer Barnhart, and Leslie Carrara-Rudolph were hired and trained, stronger female characters like Rosita (1991) and Abby Cadabby (2006) were created.\nIn 2002, \"Sesame Street\" was ranked number 27 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. Sesame Workshop won a Peabody Award in 2009 for its website, sesamestreet.org, and the show was given Peabody's Institutional Award in 2019 for 50 years of educating and entertaining children globally. In 2013, \"TV Guide\" ranked the show number 30 on its list of the 60 best TV series. As of 2021, \"Sesame Street\" has received 205 Emmy Awards, more than any other television series. In 2023, \"Variety\" ranked \"Sesame Street\" #12 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.\nReferences.\nInformational notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The three types of polder are:\nThe ground level in drained marshes subsides over time. All polders will eventually be below the surrounding water level some or all of the time. Water enters the low-lying polder through infiltration and water pressure of groundwater, or rainfall, or transport of water by rivers and canals. This usually means that the polder has an excess of water, which is pumped out or drained by opening sluices at low tide. Care must be taken not to set the internal water level too low. Polder land made up of peat (former marshland) will sink in relation to its previous level, because of peat decomposing when exposed to oxygen from the air. \nPolders are at risk of flooding at all times, and care must be taken to protect the surrounding dikes. Dikes are typically built with locally available materials, and each material has its own risks: sand is prone to collapse owing to saturation by water; dry peat is lighter than water and potentially unable to retain water in very dry seasons. Some animals dig tunnels in the barrier, allowing water to infiltrate the structure; the muskrat is known for this activity and hunted in certain European countries because of it. Polders are most commonly, though not exclusively, found in river deltas, former fenlands, and coastal areas.\nFlooding of polders has also been used as a military tactic in the past. One example is the flooding of the polders along the Yser River during World War I. Opening the sluices at high tide and closing them at low tide turned the polders into an inaccessible swamp, which allowed the Allied armies to stop the German army.\nThe Netherlands has a large area of polders: as much as 20% of the land area has at some point in the past been reclaimed from the sea. IJsselmeer is the most famous polder project of the Netherlands. Some other countries which have polders are Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada and China. Some examples of Dutch polder projects are Beemster, Schermer, Flevopolder and Noordoostpolder.\nEtymology.\nThe Dutch word derives successively from Middle Dutch , from Old Dutch , and ultimately from \"pol-\", a piece of land elevated above its surroundings, with the augmentative suffix \"-er\" and epenthetical \" -d-\". The word has been adopted in thirty-six languages.\nNetherlands.\nThe Netherlands is frequently associated with polders, as its engineers became noted for developing techniques to drain wetlands and make them usable for agriculture and other development. This is illustrated by the saying \"God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands\".\nThe Dutch have a long history of reclamation of marshes and fenland, resulting in some 3,000 \"polders\" nationwide. By 1961, about half of the country's land, , was reclaimed from the sea. About half the total surface area of \"polders\" in northwest Europe is in the Netherlands. The first embankments in Europe were constructed in Roman times. The first polders were constructed in the 11th century. The oldest extant polder is the Achtermeer polder, from 1533.\nAs a result of flooding disasters, water boards called \"waterschap\" (when situated more inland) or \"hoogheemraadschap\" (near the sea, mainly used in the Holland region) were set up to maintain the integrity of the water defences around polders, maintain the waterways inside a polder, and control the various water levels inside and outside the polder. Water boards hold separate elections, levy taxes, and function independently from other government bodies. Their function is basically unchanged even today. As such, they are the oldest democratic institutions in the country. The necessary cooperation among all ranks to maintain polder integrity gave its name to the Dutch version of third-way politics\u2014the \"Polder Model\".\nThe 1953 flood disaster prompted a new approach to the design of dikes and other water-retaining structures, based on an acceptable probability of overflowing. Risk is defined as the product of probability and consequences. The potential damage in lives, property, and rebuilding costs is compared with the potential cost of water defences. From these calculations follows an acceptable flood risk from the sea at one in 4,000\u201310,000\u00a0years, while it is one in 100\u20132,500\u00a0years for a river flood. The particular established policy guides the Dutch government to improve flood defences as new data on threat levels become available.\nMajor Dutch polders and the years they were laid dry include Beemster (1609\u20131612), Schermer (1633\u20131635), and Haarlemmermeerpolder (1852). Polders created as part of the Zuiderzee Works include Wieringermeerpolder (1930), Noordoostpolder (1942) and Flevopolder (1956\u20131968)\nExamples of polders.\nBrazil.\nSeveral cities on the Para\u00edba Valley region (in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo) have polders on land claimed from the floodplains around the Para\u00edba do Sul river.\nBangladesh.\nBangladesh has 139 polders, of which 49 are sea-facing, while the rest are along the numerous distributaries of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River delta. These were constructed in the 1960s to protect the coast from tidal flooding and reduce salinity incursion. They reduce long-term flooding and waterlogging following storm surges from tropical cyclones. They are also cultivated for agriculture.\nChina.\nHistory.\nThe Jiangnan region, at the Yangtze River Delta, has a long history of constructing polders. Most of these projects were performed between the 10th and 13th centuries. The Chinese government also assisted local communities in constructing dikes for swampland water drainage. The Lijia (\u91cc\u7532) self-monitoring system of 110 households under a \"lizhang\" (\u91cc\u957f) headman was used for the purposes of service administration and tax collection in the polder, with a \"liangzhang\" (\u7cae\u957f, grain chief) responsible for maintaining the water system and a \"tangzhang\" (\u5858\u957f, dike chief) for polder maintenance.\nGermany.\nIn Germany, land reclaimed by diking is called a \"koog\". The German \"Deichgraf\" system was similar to the Dutch and is widely known from Theodor Storm's novella \"The Rider on the White Horse\".\nIn southern Germany, the term \"polder\" is used for retention basins recreated by opening dikes during river floodplain restoration, a meaning somewhat opposite to that in coastal context."}

{"id": "48068", "revid": "7007500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48068", "title": "Maurice Ravel", "text": "French composer (1875\u20131937)\nJoseph Maurice Ravel (7 March 1875 \u2013 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor. He is often associated with Impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy, although both composers rejected the term. In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer.\nBorn to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, \"Bol\u00e9ro\" (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development. Renowned for his abilities in orchestration, Ravel made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' piano music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" is the best known.\nA slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries. Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music. Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration. Some of his piano music, such as \"Gaspard de la nuit\" (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as \"Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9\" (1912) require skilful balance in performance.\nRavel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public. From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision.\nLife and career.\nEarly years.\nRavel was born in the Basque town of Ciboure, France, near Biarritz, from the Spanish border. His father, Pierre-Joseph Ravel, was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in Versoix near the Franco-Swiss border. His mother, Marie, n\u00e9e Delouart, was Basque but had grown up in Madrid. In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status \u2013 Marie was illegitimate and barely literate \u2013 but the marriage was a happy one. Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early internal combustion engine and a notorious circus machine, the \"Whirlwind of Death\", an automotive loop-the-loop that was a major attraction until a fatal accident at Barnum and Bailey's Circus in 1903.\nBoth Ravel's parents were Roman Catholics; Marie was also something of a free-thinker, a trait inherited by her elder son. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, \u00c9douard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.\nRavel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general. In later life, Ravel recalled, \"Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music. My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age.\" There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father.\nWhen he was seven, Ravel started piano lessons with Henri Ghys, a friend of Emmanuel Chabrier; five years later, in 1887, he began studying harmony, counterpoint and composition with Charles-Ren\u00e9, a pupil of L\u00e9o Delibes. Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy. Charles-Ren\u00e9 found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him \"and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort\". Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by Schumann, variations on a theme by Grieg and a single movement of a piano sonata. They survive only in fragmentary form.\nIn 1888 Ravel met the young pianist Ricardo Vi\u00f1es, who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music. The two shared an appreciation of Wagner, Russian music, and the writings of Poe, Baudelaire and Mallarm\u00e9. At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy, as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan, also heard during the Exposition.\n\u00c9mile Decombes took over as Ravel's piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance. Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the Salle \u00c9rard along with other pupils of Decombes, including Reynaldo Hahn and Alfred Cortot.\nParis Conservatoire.\nWith the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the Conservatoire de Paris. In November 1889, playing music by Chopin, he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eug\u00e8ne Anthiome. Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student. Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer. The musicologist Arbie Orenstein writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period \"of immense growth... from adolescence to maturity\".\nIn 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of Charles-Wilfrid de B\u00e9riot, for piano, and \u00c9mile Pessard, for harmony. He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from B\u00e9riot but, in the words of the musicologist Barbara L. Kelly, he \"was only teachable on his own terms\". His later teacher Gabriel Faur\u00e9 understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s. Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes. His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: \"S\u00e9r\u00e9nade grotesque\", for piano, and \"Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer\", a \"m\u00e9lodie\" setting a poem by Roland de Mar\u00e8s (both 1893).\nRavel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Vi\u00f1es and Cortot were. It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer. From this point he concentrated on composition. His works from the period include the songs \"Un grand sommeil noir\" and \"D'Anne jouant de l'espinette\" to words by Paul Verlaine and Cl\u00e9ment Marot, and the piano pieces \"Menuet antique\" and \"Habanera\" (for four hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the \"Rapsodie espagnole\". At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie, who was earning a living as a caf\u00e9 pianist. Ravel was one of the first musicians \u2013 Debussy was another \u2013 who recognised Satie's originality and talent. Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them \"of inestimable value\".\nIn 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Faur\u00e9, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with Andr\u00e9 Gedalge. Both these teachers, particularly Faur\u00e9, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer. As Ravel's course progressed, Faur\u00e9 reported \"a distinct gain in maturity... engaging wealth of imagination\". Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, Th\u00e9odore Dubois, who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook. Consequently, according to a fellow student, Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, he was \"a marked man, against whom all weapons were good\". He wrote some substantial works while studying with Faur\u00e9, including the overture \"Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade\" and a single movement violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900. As a former student he was allowed to attend Faur\u00e9's classes as a non-participating \"auditeur\" until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903.\nIn May 1897 Ravel conducted the first performance of the \"Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade\" overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics. One described the piece as \"a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School\" and called Ravel a \"mediocrely gifted debutant... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard\". Another critic, Pierre Lalo, thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven. Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic. In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: \"Pavane pour une infante d\u00e9funte\" (\"Pavane for a dead princess\"). It was originally a solo piano work, commissioned by the Princesse de Polignac.\nFrom the start of his career, Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise. Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine. The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical. At twenty years of age he was, in the words of the biographer Burnett James, \"self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter\". He dressed like a dandy and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour. Orenstein comments that, short in stature, light in frame and bony in features, Ravel had the \"appearance of a well-dressed jockey\", whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect. During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven.\nLes Apaches and Debussy.\nAround 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics and musicians joined together in an informal group; they came to be known as Les Apaches (\"The Hooligans\"), a name coined by Vi\u00f1es to represent their status as \"artistic outcasts\". They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works. The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla as well as their French friends.\nAmong the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy. Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years. In 1902 Andr\u00e9 Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera\" Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.\nDebussy was widely held to be an Impressionist composer \u2013 a label he intensely disliked. Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre. Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an Impressionist but that he himself was not. Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship. Ravel wrote that Debussy's \"genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition. For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of [his] symbolism.\" During the first years of the new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece \"Jeux d'eau\" (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle \"Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade\" (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works. Nichols calls the quartet \"at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence\".\nThe two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons. Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other. Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom. Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, \"Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people.\" The public tension led to personal estrangement. Ravel said, \"It's probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons.\" Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift. In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac. Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne Br\u00e9val, contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband.\nScandal and success.\nDuring the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome, past winners of which included Berlioz, Gounod, Bizet, Massenet and Debussy. In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition. In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy, the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies. In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a \"furore\". He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable. The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu, was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received. \"L'affaire Ravel\" became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Faur\u00e9, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire.\nAmong those taking a close interest in the controversy was Alfred Edwards, owner and editor of \"Le Matin\", for which Lalo wrote. Edwards was married to Ravel's friend Misia; the couple took Ravel on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, the first time he had travelled abroad.\nBy the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra. He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed. There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters. The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were \"Pavane pour une infante d\u00e9funte\" (orchestrated 1910), \"Une barque sur l'oc\u00e9an\" (1906, from the 1905 piano suite \"Miroirs\"), the Habanera section of \"Rapsodie espagnole\" (1907\u201308), \"Ma m\u00e8re l'Oye\" (1908\u201310, orchestrated 1911), \"Valses nobles et sentimentales\" (1911, orchestrated 1912), \"Alborada del gracioso\" (from \"Miroirs\", orchestrated 1918) and \"Le tombeau de Couperin\" (1914\u201317, orchestrated 1919).\nRavel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Faur\u00e9, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: \"Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound.\" When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they \"would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity\". The best-known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907\u201308. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from \"the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... \"Complexe mais pas compliqu\u00e9\" was his motto.\"\nVaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels; Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.\nRavel's first concert outside France was in 1909. As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts Fran\u00e7ais, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation.\n1910 to First World War.\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique, founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers, had been dominated since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by Vincent d'Indy. Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Faur\u00e9, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Musicale Ind\u00e9pendante, with Faur\u00e9 as its president. The new society's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Faur\u00e9's song cycle \"La chanson d'\u00c8ve\", Debussy's piano suite \"D'un cahier d'esquisses\", Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly's \"Six pi\u00e8ces pour piano\" and the original piano duet version of Ravel's \"Ma m\u00e8re l'Oye\". The performers included Faur\u00e9, Florent Schmitt, Ernest Bloch, Pierre Monteux and, in the Debussy work, Ravel. Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel's new influence that the society featured Satie's music in a concert in January 1911.\nThe first of Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy \"L'heure espagnole\" was premiered in 1911. The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Albert Carr\u00e9, repeatedly deferred its presentation. He was concerned that its plot \u2013 a bedroom farce \u2013 would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique's audience. The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular.\nIn 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered. The first, to the orchestrated and expanded version of \"Ma m\u00e8re l'Oye\", opened at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Arts in January. The reviews were excellent: the \"Mercure de France\" called the score \"absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature\". The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen's Hall, London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year. \"The Times\" praised \"the enchantment of the work... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing\". New York audiences heard the work in the same year. Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was \"Ad\u00e9la\u00efde ou le langage des fleurs\", danced to the score of \"Valses nobles et sentimentales\", which opened at the Ch\u00e2telet in April. \"Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9\" opened at the same theatre in June. This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete.\n\"Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9\" was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes. Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine, and designer, L\u00e9on Bakst. Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music. This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music. There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work. It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London. The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere.\nRavel composed little during 1913. He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky's unfinished opera \"Khovanshchina\", and his own works were the \"Trois po\u00e8mes de Mallarm\u00e9\" for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, \"\u00c0 la mani\u00e8re de Borodine\" and \"\u00c0 la mani\u00e8re de Chabrier\". In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of \"The Rite of Spring\". Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music. Ravel predicted that the premiere of the \"Rite\" would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\".\nWar.\nWhen Germany invaded France in 1914 Ravel tried to join the French Air Force. He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint. While waiting to be enlisted, Ravel composed \"Trois Chansons\", his only work for a cappella choir, setting his own texts in the tradition of French 16th-century chansons. He dedicated the three songs to people who might help him to enlist. After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty. Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend's courage: \"at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place, or done nothing\". Some of Ravel's duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment. At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother's failing health. His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following amoebic dysentery in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter.\nDuring the war the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Fran\u00e7aise was formed by Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Dubois, d'Indy and others, campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music. Ravel declined to join, telling the committee of the league in 1916, \"It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues, and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie: our musical art, which is so rich at the present time, would soon degenerate, becoming isolated in banal formulas.\" The league responded by banning Ravel's music from its concerts.\nRavel's mother died in January 1917, and he fell into a \"horrible despair\", compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war. He composed few works in the war years. The Piano Trio was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is \"Le tombeau de Couperin\", composed between 1914 and 1917. The suite celebrates the tradition of Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel's who died in the war.\n1920s.\nAfter the war, those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina. As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, \"Ravel's emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised.\" His output, never large, became smaller. Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era. Faur\u00e9 wrote to him, \"I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly. It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor.\" Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920, and although he declined the decoration, he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Les Six as an establishment figure. Satie had turned against him, and commented, \"Ravel refuses the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, but all his music accepts it.\" Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie's early music, and always acknowledged the older man's influence on his own development. Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks. He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style. Through the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Musicale Ind\u00e9pendante, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 presented concerts of recent works by American composers including Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott.\nOrenstein and Zank both comment that, although Ravel's post-war output was small, averaging only one composition a year, it included some of his finest works. In 1920 he completed \"La valse\", in response to a commission from Diaghilev. He had worked on it intermittently for some years, planning a concert piece, \"a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling\". It was rejected by Diaghilev, who said, \"It's a masterpiece, but it's not a ballet. It's the portrait of a ballet.\" Ravel heard Diaghilev's verdict without protest or argument, left, and had no further dealings with him. Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died. A ballet danced to the orchestral version of \"Le tombeau de Couperin\" was given at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es in November 1920, and the premiere of \"La valse\" followed in December. The following year \"Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9\" and \"L'heure espagnole\" were successfully revived at the Paris Op\u00e9ra.\nIn the post-war era there was a reaction against the large-scale music of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss. Stravinsky, whose \"Rite of Spring\" was written for a huge orchestra, began to work on a much smaller scale. His 1923 ballet score \"Les noces\" is composed for voices and twenty-one instruments. Ravel did not like the work (his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky's friendship with him) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for \"d\u00e9pouillement\" \u2013 the \"stripping away\" of pre-war extravagance to reveal the essentials. Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces. Other influences on him in this period were jazz and atonality. Jazz was popular in Parisian caf\u00e9s, and French composers such as Darius Milhaud incorporated elements of it in their work. Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to grand opera, and its influence is heard in his later music. Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg's abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel's music such as the \"Chansons mad\u00e9casses\" (1926), which Ravel doubted he could have written without the example of \"Pierrot Lunaire\". His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" (1922), the opera \"L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges\" to a libretto by Colette (1926), \"Tzigane\" (1924) and the Violin Sonata No.2 (1927).\nFinding city life fatiguing, Ravel moved to the countryside. In May 1921 he took up residence at Le Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re, a small house on the fringe of Montfort-l'Amaury, west of Paris, in the Seine-et-Oise d\u00e9partement. Looked after by a devoted housekeeper, Mme Revelot, he lived there for the rest of his life. At Le Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Ravel composed and gardened, when not performing in Paris or abroad. His touring schedule increased considerably in the 1920s, with concerts in Britain, Sweden, Denmark, the US, Canada, Spain, Austria and Italy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRavel was fascinated by the dynamism of American life, its huge cities, skyscrapers, and its advanced technology, and was impressed by its jazz, Negro spirituals, and the excellence of American orchestras. American cuisine was apparently another matter.\n Arbie Orenstein\n After two months of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting. His fee was a guaranteed minimum of $10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes. He appeared with most of the leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities. Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary. At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York, the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat. Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, \"You know, this doesn't happen to me in Paris.\" Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon. Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity. He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when they called him \"the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion\".\nThe last composition Ravel completed in the 1920s, \"Bol\u00e9ro\", became his most famous. He was commissioned to provide a score for Ida Rubinstein's ballet company, and having been unable to secure the rights to orchestrate Alb\u00e9niz's \"Iberia\", he decided on \"an experiment in a very special and limited direction... a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of orchestral tissue without music\". Ravel continued that the work was \"one long, very gradual crescendo. There are no contrasts, and there is practically no invention except the plan and the manner of the execution. The themes are altogether impersonal.\" He was astonished, and not wholly pleased, that it became a mass success. When one elderly member of the audience at the Op\u00e9ra shouted \"Rubbish!\" at the premiere, he remarked, \"That old lady got the message!\" The work was popularised by the conductor Arturo Toscanini, and has been recorded several hundred times. Ravel commented to Arthur Honegger, one of Les Six, \"I've written only one masterpiece \u2013 \"Bol\u00e9ro\". Unfortunately there's no music in it.\"\nLast years.\nAt the beginning of the 1930s Ravel was working on two piano concertos. He completed the Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand first. It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who had lost his right arm during the First World War. Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: \"In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands.\" Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated it with both hands. Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work. In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year. The critic Henry Pruni\u00e8res wrote, \"From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us.\"\nThe Piano Concerto in G major was completed a year later. After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel's score, though not for his conducting. Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHis final years were cruel, for he was gradually losing his memory and some of his coordinating powers, and he was, of course, quite aware of it.\nIgor Stravinsky\nIn October 1932 Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the \"British Medical Journal\" in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, \"Don Quixote\" (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as \"Don Quichotte \u00e0 Dulcin\u00e9e\". The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.\nIn 1937 Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition, and was examined by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, and expected to find ventriculomegaly from hydrocephalus that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother \u00c9douard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.\nOn 30 December 1937 Ravel was interred next to his parents in a granite tomb at Levallois-Perret cemetery, in north-west Paris. He was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony.\nMusic.\nMarcel Marnat's catalogue of Ravel's complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned. Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel's frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra. The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental. Ravel's music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera and song cycles. He wrote no symphonies or church works.\nRavel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Faur\u00e9 and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy. Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert, Liszt and Chopin. He considered himself in many ways a classicist, often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary, to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies. The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhatever sauce you put around the melody is a matter of taste. What is important is the melodic line.\nRavel to Vaughan Williams\nRavel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is \"an implied melodic outline in all vital music\". His themes are frequently modal, eschewing the familiar major or minor scales. Chords of the ninth and eleventh and unresolved appoggiaturas, such as those in the \"Valses nobles et sentimentales\", are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language.\nDance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the bolero and pavane, but also the minuet, forlane, rigaudon, waltz, czardas, habanera and passacaglia. National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to Hebraic, Greek, Hungarian and gypsy themes. He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired \u2013 Borodin, Chabrier, Faur\u00e9 and Haydn, interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style. Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that \"true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion\", with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude.\nOperas.\nRavel completed two operas, and worked on three others. The unrealised three were \"Olympia\", \"La cloche engloutie\" and \"Jeanne d'Arc\". \"Olympia\" was to be based on Hoffmann's \"The Sandman\"; he made sketches for it in 1898\u201399, but did not progress far. \"La cloche engloutie\" after Hauptmann's \"The Sunken Bell\" occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a \"Symphonie horlog\u00e8re\" which he incorporated into the opening of \"L'heure espagnole\". The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph Delteil's 1925 novel about Joan of Arc. It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Op\u00e9ra, but Ravel's final illness prevented him from writing it. \nRavel's first completed opera was \"L'heure espagnole\" (premiered in 1911), described as a \"com\u00e9die musicale\". It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career. Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered \"perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects\". Edward Burlingame Hill found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, \"giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action\", and \"commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage\". Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity. The critic David Murray writes that the score \"glows with the famous Ravel \"tendresse\".\"\nThe second opera, also in one act, is \"L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges\" (1926), a \"fantaisie lyrique\" to a libretto by Colette. She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto. It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than \"L'heure espagnole\", and the jazz elements and bitonality of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers. Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds \"profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work\". The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, \"extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout\".\nAlthough one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones, Ravel's are produced regularly in France and abroad.\nOther vocal works.\nA substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal. His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome. His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as \"a static, recitative-like vocal style\", prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility. By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in \"Histoires naturelles\". The same technique is highlighted in \"Trois po\u00e8mes de Mallarm\u00e9\" (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided. In the cycles \"Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade\" and \"Chansons mad\u00e9casses\", Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment.\nRavel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as \"Cinq m\u00e9lodies populaires grecques\", \"Deux m\u00e9lodies h\u00e9bra\u00efques\" and \"Chants populaires\". Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, L\u00e9on-Paul Fargue, Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine. For three songs dating from 1914 to 1915, he wrote his own texts.\nAlthough Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, \"Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade\", to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.\nOrchestral works.\nDuring his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous. He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use. The critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote, \"In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a \"pp\" tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another.\"\nFor all Ravel's orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: \"Rapsodie espagnole\", \"La valse\" and the two concertos. All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in \"Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9\", or as a reworking of piano pieces, \"Alborada del gracioso\" and \"Une barque sur l'ocean\", (\"Miroirs\"), \"Valses nobles et sentimentales,\" \"Ma m\u00e8re l'Oye\", \"Tzigane\" (originally for violin and piano) and \"Le tombeau de Couperin.\" In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms. Occasionally, as in the \"Alborada del gracioso\", critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original.\nIn some of his scores from the 1920s, including \"Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9\", Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility. His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points. In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures. The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint-Sa\u00ebns, alongside use of jazz-like themes. The critics Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor comment that in the slow movement, \"one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented\", the composer \"can truly be said to join hands with Mozart\". The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, \"Bol\u00e9ro\" (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating \"a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm\".\nRavel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky's piano suite \"Pictures at an Exhibition\". Orchestral versions of the last by Mikhail Tushmalov, Sir Henry Wood and Leo Funtek predated Ravel's 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel's remains the best known. Kelly remarks on its \"dazzling array of instrumental colour\", and a contemporary reviewer commented on how, in dealing with another composer's music, Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own.\nPiano music.\nAlthough Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch \"from the striking simplicity of \"Ma m\u00e8re l'Oye\" to the transcendental virtuosity of \"Gaspard de la nuit\"\". Ravel's earliest major work for piano, \"Jeux d'eau\" (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later. When writing for solo piano, Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity. The authors of \"The Record Guide\" consider that works such as \"Gaspard de la Nuit\" and \"Miroirs\" have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration \"in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself\".\nMost of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges. Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, \"A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing. It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in \"Alborada del gracioso\"... and the two outer movements of \"Gaspard de la nuit\". Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale.\" This balance caused a breach between the composer and Vi\u00f1es, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in \"Gaspard de la nuit\", \"Le gibet\" would \"bore the audience to death\". Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing.\nRavel's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; \"Menuet sur le nom de Haydn\" (1909), \"\u00c0 la mani\u00e8re de Borodine\" (1912), \"\u00c0 la mani\u00e8re de Chabrier\" (1913) and \"Le tombeau de Couperin\" all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner. Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: \"Listen to \"Le tombeau de Couperin\" and the complete ballet music for \"Ma m\u00e8re L'Oye\" in the classic recordings conducted by Andr\u00e9 Cluytens, and the piano versions never sound quite the same again.\"\nChamber music.\nApart from a one-movement Sonata for Violin and Piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer's lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works. The earliest is the String Quartet (1902\u201303), dedicated to Faur\u00e9, and showing the influence of Debussy's quartet of ten years earlier. Like the Debussy, it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour. The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel's standards. It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the \"Pavane pour une infante d\u00e9funte\". Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio (1914) to complete it before joining the French Army. It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel's growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, \"blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own,\" in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson.\nRavel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920\u201322), the \"Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Faur\u00e9\" for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of \"Tzigane\" for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923\u201327). The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher, and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist Jelly d'Ar\u00e1nyi. The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody. His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work. Ravel said that the violin and piano are \"essentially incompatible\" instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility. Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas \"rather laboured and unsatisfactory\", and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel's pre-war chamber works.\nRecordings.\nRavel's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on piano roll between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by Robert Casadesus, a better pianist. Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc. In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of \"Jeux d'eau\" played by Mark Hambourg, and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the \"Pavane pour une infante d\u00e9funte\" and \"Ondine\", and movements from the String Quartet, \"Le tombeau de Couperin\" and \"Ma m\u00e8re l'Oye\". Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public, and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor. A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as \"Conducted by the composer\", although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton. Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a \"Bol\u00e9ro\" in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist.\nHonours and legacy.\nRavel declined not only the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, but all state honours from France, refusing to let his name go forward for election to the Institut de France. He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921, the Belgian Ordre de L\u00e9opold in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1928.\nAfter Ravel's death, his brother and legatee, \u00c9douard, turned the composer's house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it. As at 2025 the maison-mus\u00e9e de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours.\nIn his later years, \u00c9douard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind. After his death in 1960, the estate passed through several hands. Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine \"Le Point\" reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were. The British newspaper \"The Guardian\" reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair.\nMany works have been dedicated to Ravel or composed in his memory, by Satie, Stravinsky and others.\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She achieved stardom and acclaim for playing lighthearted comedic roles in film and television. In a career spanning six decades, she has received several awards, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for a BAFTA Award and two Primetime Emmy Awards.\nShe rose to fame on the NBC sketch comedy program \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In\" (1968\u20131970). She made her screen debut in a minor role in the western comedy \"The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band\" (1968), before going on to receive the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her comedic role in \"Cactus Flower\" (1969). She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for playing a woman who enlists for the army in the comedy \"Private Benjamin\" (1980).\nHawn has also starred in such comedy films as \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" (1970), \"Butterflies Are Free\" (1972), \"The Sugarland Express\" (1974), \"Shampoo\" (1975), \"Foul Play\" (1978), and \"Seems Like Old Times\" (1980). She later starred in \"Overboard\" (1987), \"Bird on a Wire\" (1990), \"Death Becomes Her\", \"Housesitter\" (both 1992), \"The First Wives Club\" (1996), \"The Out-of-Towners\" (1999), and \"The Banger Sisters\" (2002). Hawn made her return to film with roles in \"Snatched\" (2017), \"The Christmas Chronicles\" (2018), and \"The Christmas Chronicles 2\" (2020).\nHawn is the mother of actors Oliver Hudson, Kate Hudson, and Wyatt Russell. She has been in a relationship with Kurt Russell since 1983. In 2003, she founded the Hawn Foundation, which educates underprivileged children.\nEarly life.\nHawn was born in Washington, D.C. to Laura (n\u00e9e Steinhoff), a jewelry shop/dance school owner, and Edward Rutledge Hawn, a musician and conductor who was a descendant of Edward Rutledge, the youngest signatory of the Declaration of Independence. She was named after her mother's aunt. She has one sister, entertainment publicist Patti Hawn; their brother, Edward Jr., died in infancy before Patti was conceived. Growing up, the girls were unaware of their deceased brother.\nHer father was a Presbyterian of German and English descent. Her mother was Jewish, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Hungary. Hawn was raised Jewish in Takoma Park, Maryland, and attended Montgomery Blair High School in nearby Silver Spring, Maryland.\nHawn began taking ballet and tap dance lessons at the age of three and danced in the corps de ballet of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo production of \"The Nutcracker\" in 1955. She made her stage debut in 1964, playing Juliet in a Virginia Shakespeare Festival production of \"Romeo and Juliet\".\nIn 1964, Hawn ran and taught in a ballet school, having dropped out of American University where she was majoring in drama. She made her professional dancing debut in a production of \"Can-Can\" at the Texas Pavilion of the New York World's Fair. She began working as a professional dancer a year later and appeared as a go-go dancer in New York City and at the Peppermint Box in New Jersey.\nCareer.\n1966\u20131969: Breakthrough and acclaim.\nHawn moved to California to dance in a show at Melodyland Theatre, a theater in the round across from Disneyland, joining the chorus of \"Pal Joey\" and \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\" during the June 14 to September 1966 season. Hawn began her acting career as a cast member of the short-lived sitcom \"Good Morning World\" during the 1967\u20131968 television season, her role being that of the girlfriend of a radio disc jockey, with a stereotypical \"dumb blonde\" personality.\nHer next role, which brought her to international attention, was also as a dumb blonde, as one of the regular cast members on the 1968\u20131973 sketch comedy show \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In\". Hawn often broke out into high-pitched giggles in the middle of a joke, then delivered a polished performance a moment later. Noted as much for her chipper attitude as for her bikini-attired and painted body, Hawn was seen as a 1960s \"It\" girl.\nHer \"Laugh-In\" persona was parlayed into three popular film appearances in the late 1960s and early 1970s: \"Cactus Flower\", \"There's a Girl in My Soup\", and \"Butterflies Are Free\". Hawn made her film debut in a bit role as a giggling dancer in the 1968 film \"The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band\", in which she was billed as \"Goldie Jeanne\", but in her first major film role, in \"Cactus Flower\" (1969), she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Walter Matthau's suicidal fianc\u00e9e. In the same year she appeared in \"The Spring Thing\", a television special hosted by Bobbie Gentry and Noel Harrison. Other guests were Meredith MacRae, Irwin C. Watson, Rod McKuen, Shirley Bassey and Harpers Bizarre.\n1970\u20131989: Comedy stardom.\nAfter Hawn's Academy Award win, her film career took off. She starred in a string of successful comedies starting with \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" (1970), \"$\" (1971), and \"Butterflies Are Free\" (1972). She continued to prove herself in the dramatic league in 1974 with the satirical dramas \"The Girl from Petrovka\" and Steven Spielberg's theatrical debut \"The Sugarland Express\", and then co-starred in Hal Ashby's satire \"Shampoo\" (1975). She also hosted two television specials: \"Pure Goldie\" in 1971 and \"The Goldie Hawn Special\" in 1978. The latter was a sort of comeback for Hawn, who had been out of the spotlight for two years since the 1976 release of the romantic comedy western \"The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox\", while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son.\nOn the special she performed show tunes and comedy bits alongside comic legend George Burns, teen matinee idol Shaun Cassidy, television star John Ritter (during his days on \"Three's Company\"), and even the Harlem Globetrotters joined her for a montage. The special later went on to be nominated for a primetime Emmy. Four months later the film \"Foul Play\" (with Chevy Chase), was released and became a box office smash, reviving Hawn's film career. The plot centered on an innocent woman in San Francisco who becomes mixed up in an assassination plot. Hawn's next film, Mario Monicelli's \"Lovers and Liars\" (1979), was a box office bomb.\nIn 1972, Hawn recorded and released a solo country LP for Warner Brothers, titled \"Goldie\". It was recorded with the help of Dolly Parton and Buck Owens. AllMusic gives the album a favorable review, calling it a \"sweetly endearing country-tinged middle of the road pop record\".\nHawn's popularity continued into the 1980s, starting with another primetime variety special alongside actress and singer Liza Minnelli, \"Goldie and Liza Together\" (1980), which was nominated for four Emmy Awards. In the same year, Hawn took the lead role in \"Private Benjamin\", a comedy she co-produced with her friend Nancy Meyers, who co-wrote the script. Meyers recalls Hawn's reaction when she first described the idea for the story with Hawn as its lead:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was like watching the greatest audience I've ever seen. She laughed and then she got real emotional and her eyes would fill up with tears. She loved the image of herself in an Army uniform and she loved what the movie had to say.\n\"Private Benjamin\" also stars Eileen Brennan and Armand Assante, and garnered Hawn her second Academy Award nomination, this time for Best Actress. Hawn's box office success continued with comedies like \"Seems Like Old Times\" (1980), written by Neil Simon; \"Best Friends\" (1982), written by Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson; \"Protocol\" (1984), co-written by Nancy Meyers; \"Wildcats\" (1986)\u2014Hawn also served as executive producer on the latter two; and the World War II romantic drama \"Swing Shift\" (1984).\nAt the age of thirty-nine, Hawn posed for the cover of \"Playboy\"'s January 1985 issue and was the subject of the Playboy Interview. Her last film of the 1980s was opposite partner Kurt Russell, for the third time, in the comedy \"Overboard\" (1987).\n1990\u20132002: Established star and hiatus.\nIn 1990, she starred in the action comedy \"Bird on a Wire\", a critically panned but commercially successful film that paired Hawn with Mel Gibson. Hawn had mixed success in the early 1990s, with the thriller \"Deceived\" (1991), the drama \"CrissCross\", and opposite Bruce Willis and Meryl Streep in \"Death Becomes Her\" (both 1992). Earlier that year, she starred in \"Housesitter\", a screwball comedy with Steve Martin, which was a commercial success.\nHawn was absent from the screen for four years while caring for her mother, who died of cancer in 1994. She made her entry back into film as producer of the satirical comedy \"Something to Talk About\", starring Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid, and made her directorial debut with the television film \"Hope\" (1997), starring Christine Lahti and Jena Malone. Hawn returned to the screen in 1996 as the aging, alcoholic actress Elise Elliot in the financially and critically successful \"The First Wives Club\", opposite Bette Midler and Diane Keaton, with whom she covered the Lesley Gore hit \"You Don't Own Me\" for the film's soundtrack. Hawn also performed a cover version of the Beatles' song \"A Hard Day's Night\" on George Martin's 1998 album \"In My Life\".\nShe starred in Woody Allen's musical \"Everyone Says I Love You\" (1996) and reunited with Steve Martin for the comedy \"The Out-of-Towners\" (1999), a remake of the 1970 Neil Simon hit. The film was critically panned and was a box-office failure. In 1997, Hawn, along with her co-stars from \"The First Wives Club\", Diane Keaton and Bette Midler, received the Women in Film Crystal Awards.\nIn 1999, she was awarded Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year. In 2001, Hawn was reunited with former co-stars Warren Beatty (her co-star in \"$\" and \"Shampoo\") and Diane Keaton for the comedy \"Town &amp; Country\", a critical and financial fiasco. Budgeted at an estimated US$90\u00a0million, the film opened to little notice and grossed only $7\u00a0million in its North American theatrical release. In 2002, she starred in \"The Banger Sisters\", opposite Susan Sarandon and Geoffrey Rush, her last live action film for fifteen years. In 2005 Hawn's autobiography, \"A Lotus Grows in the Mud\", was published.\n2013\u2013present: Career resurgence.\nIn 2013, Hawn guest-starred, along with Gordon Ramsay, in an episode of \"Phineas and Ferb\", in which she provided the voice of neighbor Peggy McGee. In 2017, Hawn returned to the big screen for the first time since 2002, co-starring with Amy Schumer in the comedy \"Snatched\", playing mother and daughter. In 2018, Hawn cameoed as Mrs. Claus in the Netflix film \"The Christmas Chronicles\". She played Mrs. Claus again, in a leading role, in its 2020 sequel \"The Christmas Chronicles 2.\"\nPersonal life.\nBeliefs and views.\nHawn has studied meditation. In 2012, Hawn has described her religious beliefs as \"Jewish Buddhist\". \nHawn is a supporter of the LGBT community. Speaking on nations such as Nigeria and others which have criminalized gay people, she said \"This is man's inhumanity to man, of the first order.\" Hawn endorsed Senator Ted Kennedy in the 1980 Democratic presidential primaries.\nMarriages and family.\nEarly relationships.\nHawn's pre-fame boyfriends included actor Mark Goddard and singer Spiro Venduras. Her first husband was dancer (later director) Gus Trikonis, who appeared as a Shark gang member in \"West Side Story\". They married on May 16, 1969, and separated on April 9, 1973. Hawn then dated stuntman Ted Grossman, Swedish actor Bruno Wintzell and Italian actor Franco Nero, but did not file for divorce from Trikonis until New Year's Eve 1975, after becoming engaged to musician Bill Hudson of the Hudson Brothers, whom she'd met the previous summer on a first-class flight from New York to Los Angeles. \nHawn was granted a divorce in June 1976 and married Hudson on July 3 in Takoma Park, Maryland, where she grew up. They had two children, son Oliver (born September 7, 1976) and daughter Kate (born April 19, 1979). Hudson filed for divorce on August 15, 1980. Hawn subsequently had romances with French actor Yves R\u00e9nier and Moroccan businessman Victor Drai. The divorce from Hudson was finalized in March 1982.\nKurt Russell.\nHawn has been in a relationship with Kurt Russell since Valentine's Day 1983. The couple first met while filming \"The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band\" in 1967, but became involved after reconnecting on the set of \"Swing Shift\". They have a son together, Wyatt (born July 10, 1986). In 2000 and again in 2004, news outlets reported that Hawn and Russell were on the verge of breaking up. During the alleged separations, Hawn was linked to newsman Charles Glass and Pakistani former cricketer and former Prime Minister, Imran Khan. Hawn and Russell, who celebrated 40 years together in 2023, own homes in Canada (Vancouver), Colorado (Snowmass), New York (Manhattan), and California (Santa Ynez Valley, Brentwood, and Palm Desert). Hawn has said that she has no plans to marry Russell, stating that she \"would have been long divorced if [she'd] been married,\" and that she and Russell chose to stay together and they do not feel that marriage \"cements\" a relationship.\nThe Hawn Foundation.\nIn 2003, Hawn founded the Hawn Foundation, a non-profit organization which provides youth education programs intended to improve academic performance through \"life-enhancing strategies for well-being\". The Hawn Foundation has supported research studies conducted by external researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of its educational program for children, called MindUP.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n Videos "}

{"id": "48081", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48081", "title": "Essentialism", "text": "View that entities have identifying attributes\nEssentialism is the view that objects have a set of attributes that are necessary to their identity. In early Western thought, Platonic idealism held that all things have such an \"essence\"\u2014an \"idea\" or \"form\". In \"Categories\", Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a substance that, as George Lakoff put it, \"make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not \"that\" kind of thing\". The contrary view\u2014non-essentialism\u2014denies the need to posit such an \"essence\". Essentialism has been controversial from its beginning. In the \"Parmenides\" dialogue, Plato depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the \"existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt\".\nOlder social theories were often conceptually essentialist. In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for taxonomy at least until the time of Charles Darwin. The role and importance of essentialism in modern biology is still a matter of debate. Beliefs which posit that social identities such as race, ethnicity, nationality, or gender are essential characteristics have been central to many discriminatory or extremist ideologies. For instance, psychological essentialism is correlated with racial prejudice. Essentialist views about race have also been shown to diminish empathy when dealing with members of another racial group. In medical sciences, essentialism can lead to a reified view of identities, leading to fallacious conclusions and potentially unequal treatment.\nIn philosophy.\nAn \"essence\" characterizes a substance or a form, in the sense of the forms and ideas in Platonic idealism. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, and is present in every possible world. Classical humanism has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable human nature. This has been criticized by Kierkegaard, Marx, Heidegger, Sartre, Badiou and many other existential, materialist and anti-humanist thinkers. Essentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of \"essence\". Unlike existentialism, which posits \"being\" as the fundamental reality, the essentialist ontology must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.\nIn Plato's philosophy, in particular the \"Timaeus\" and the \"Philebus\", things were said to come into being by the action of a demiurge who works to form chaos into ordered entities. Similarly, many definitions of \"essence\" hark back to the ancient Greek hylomorphic understanding of the formation of the things as articulated, for example, by Aristotle. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires \"hyle\" (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in their own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (\"morphe\"). Aristotle was the first to use the terms \"hyle\" and \"morphe\", developing an account indebted to Plato's. According to Aristotle's explanation, all entities have two aspects: \"matter\" and \"form\". It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity\u2014its quiddity or \"whatness\" (i.e., \"what it is\"). Plato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms\u2014an abstract entity of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some \"idea\" in common\u2014the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato's forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects\u2014the abstract properties that make them what they are. One example is Plato's parable of the cave. Plato believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man's limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the \"essential\" or ideal and the \"perceived\".\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BC) applied the term \"essence\" to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, \"rationality\" is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle's philosophy, Bertrand Russell said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing's \"essence\" consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the \"name\" for it, rather than those properties without which a thing would not be what kind of thing it actually is. Although the concept of essence was, according to Bertrand Russell, \"hopelessly muddled\" it became part of every philosophy until modern times. The Egyptian-born philosopher Plotinus (204\u2013270 AD) brought idealism to the Roman Empire as Neoplatonism, and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a \"primary essence\" but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.\nExamples.\nNaturalism.\nDating back to the 18th century, naturalism is a form of essentialism in which social matters are explained through the logic of natural dispositions. The invoked nature can be biological, ontological or theological. It is opposed by antinaturalism and culturalism.\nHuman nature.\nIn the case of \"Homo sapiens\", the divergent conceptions of human nature may be partitioned into \"essentialist\" versus \"non-essentialist\" (or even \"anti-essentialist\") positions. Another established dichotomy is that of monism versus pluralism about the matter.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Monism will demand that enhancement technologies be used to create humans as close as possible to the ideal state. [...] The Nazis would have proposed the list of characteristics for admission to the SS as the universal template for enhancement technologies. Hedonistic utilitarianism is a less objectionable version of monism, according to which the best human life is one that contains as much pleasure and as little suffering as possible \u2013 but like Nazism, it leaves no room for meaningful choice about enhancement.\u2014\u200a\nBiological essentialism.\nBefore evolution was developed as a scientific theory, the essentialist view of biology posited that all species are unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as Louis Agassiz in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator. Some religious opponents of evolution continue to maintain this view of biology. \nWork by historians of systematic biology in the 21st century has cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan M\u00fcller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as Linnaeus and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and that the so-called \"essentialism story\" (or \"myth\") in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed and biological examples used by philosophers going back to Aristotle and continuing through to John Stuart Mill and William Whewell in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, with the way that biologists used such terms as \"species\". \nAnti-essentialists contend that an essentialist typological categorization has been rendered obsolete and untenable by evolutionary theory for several reasons. First, they argue that biological species are dynamic entities, emerging and disappearing as distinct populations are molded by natural selection. This view contrasts with the static essences that essentialists say characterize natural categories. Second, the opponents of essentialism argue that our current understanding of biological species emphasizes genealogical relationships rather than \"intrinsic\" traits. Lastly, non-essentialists assert that every organism has a mutational load, and the variability and diversity within species contradict the notion of fixed biological natures.\nGender essentialism.\nIn feminist theory and gender studies, gender essentialism is the attribution of fixed essences to men and women\u2014this idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention. Gay/lesbian rights advocate Diana Fuss wrote: \"Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the 'whatness' of a given entity.\" Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine. These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist Elizabeth Grosz states in her 1995 publication \"Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies\" that essentialism \"entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change\u2014it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization.\"\nGender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 \"New York Times\" best seller \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\", but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women's studies textbooks such as \"Women: Images &amp; Realities\". Starting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. Evelyn Fox Keller, Sandra Harding,\n and Nancy Tuana\n argued that the modern scientific enterprise is inherently patriarchal and incompatible with women's nature. Other feminist scholars, such as Ann Hibner Koblitz, Lenore Blum, Mary Gray, Mary Beth Ruskai, and Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram have criticized those theories for ignoring the diverse nature of scientific research and the tremendous variation in women's experiences in different cultures and historical periods.\nRacial, cultural and strategic essentialism.\nCultural and racial essentialism is the view that fundamental biological or physical characteristics of human \"races\" produce personality, heritage, cognitive abilities, or 'natural talents' that are shared by all members of a racial group. In the early 20th century, many anthropologists taught this theory \u2013 that race was an entirely biological phenomenon and that this was core to a person's behavior and identity. This, coupled with a belief that linguistic, cultural, and social groups fundamentally existed along racial lines, formed the basis of what is now called scientific racism. After the Nazi eugenics program, along with the rise of anti-colonial movements, racial essentialism lost widespread popularity. New studies of culture and the fledgling field of population genetics undermined the scientific standing of racial essentialism, leading race anthropologists to revise their conclusions about the sources of phenotypic variation. A significant number of modern anthropologists and biologists in the West came to view race as an invalid genetic or biological designation.\nHistorically, beliefs which posit that social identities such as ethnicity, nationality or gender determine a person's essential characteristics have in many cases been shown to have destructive or harmful results. It has been argued by some that essentialist thinking lies at the core of many simplistic, discriminatory or extremist ideologies. Psychological essentialism is also correlated with racial prejudice. In medical sciences, essentialism can lead to an over-emphasis on the role of identities\u2014for example assuming that differences in hypertension in African-American populations are due to racial differences rather than social causes\u2014leading to fallacious conclusions and potentially unequal treatment. Older social theories were often conceptually essentialist.\nStrategic essentialism, a major concept in postcolonial theory, was introduced in the 1980s by the Indian literary critic and theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. It refers to a political tactic in which minority groups, nationalities, or ethnic groups mobilize on the basis of shared gendered, cultural, or political identity. While strong differences may exist between members of these groups, and among themselves they engage in continuous debates, it is sometimes advantageous for them to temporarily \"essentialize\" themselves, despite it being based on erroneous logic, and to bring forward their group identity in a simplified way to achieve certain goals, such as equal rights or antiglobalization.\nMachine learning.\nPelillo argues that traditional machine learning techniques often align with an essentialist paradigm by relying on features - properties assumed to be essential for classification tasks. For instance, pattern recognition, which attempts to extract essential attributes from data, is described as inherently essentialist since it presupposes that objects have stable, identifiable essences that define their categories. This perspective extends to similarity-based approaches, which use prototype theory to establish relationships within data by grouping instances around central prototypes that exhibit the \"essence\" of a category.\nExpanding on this, Pelillo and Scantamburlo highlight that certain machine-learning scenarios, such as when data is highly dimensional or features are poorly defined, challenge the essentialist framework. They advocate for alternative paradigms that consider relational and contextual information instead of isolated feature analysis. This relational focus aligns with anti-essentialist stances, which view categories as dynamic and context-dependent rather than fixed.\nIn historiography.\nEssentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. Herodotus, for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a \"softness\" which has made Egypt easy to conquer. To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity, or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his \"Histories\".\nEssentialism had been operative in colonialism, as well as in critiques of colonialism. Post-colonial theorists, such as Edward Said, insisted that essentialism was the \"defining mode\" of \"Western\" historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to Touraj Atabaki, manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as Eurocentrism, over-generalization, and reductionism. Into the 21st century, most historians, social scientists, and humanists reject methodologies associated with essentialism, although some have argued that certain varieties of essentialism may be useful or even necessary. Karl Popper splits the ambiguous term \"realism\" into \"essentialism\" and \"realism\". He uses \"essentialism\" whenever he means the opposite of nominalism, and \"realism\" only as opposed to idealism. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like \"a puppy is a young dog\" should be read from right to left as an answer to \"What shall we call a young dog\", never from left to right as an answer to \"What is a puppy?\"\nIn psychology.\nThere is a difference between metaphysical essentialism and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognition. Influential in this area is Susan Gelman, who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms\u2014i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class. This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence.\nIn developmental psychology.\nEssentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly developmental psychology. In 1991, Kathryn Kremer and Susan Gelman studied the extent to which children from four\u2013seven years old demonstrate essentialism. Children believed that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Children were able to describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects' behavior as a result of an adult influencing the object. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking. Younger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in cognitive development. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding.\nThere are four key criteria that constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms. The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development. According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability. Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential. This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different; however similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences. The implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups. For example, essentialism of nationality has been linked to anti-immigration attitudes. In multiple studies in India and the United States, it was shown that in lay view a person's nationality is considerably fixed at birth, even if that person is adopted and raised by a family of another nationality at day one and never told about their origin. This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development. Paul Bloom of Yale University has stated that \"one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists.\" Scholars suggest that the categorical nature of essentialist thinking predicts the use of stereotypes and can be targeted in the application of stereotype prevention.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For any pair of distinct non-antipodal points on the sphere, there is a unique great circle passing through both. (Every great circle through any point also passes through its antipodal point, so there are infinitely many great circles through two antipodal points.) The shorter of the two great-circle arcs between two distinct points on the sphere is called the \"minor arc\", and is the shortest surface-path between them. Its arc length is the great-circle distance between the points (the intrinsic distance on a sphere), and is proportional to the measure of the central angle formed by the two points and the center of the sphere.\nA great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on any given sphere. Any diameter of any great circle coincides with a diameter of the sphere, and therefore every great circle is concentric with the sphere and shares the same radius. Any other circle of the sphere is called a small circle, and is the intersection of the sphere with a plane not passing through its center. Small circles are the spherical-geometry analog of circles in Euclidean space.\nEvery circle in Euclidean 3-space is a great circle of exactly one sphere.\nThe disk bounded by a great circle is called a \"great disk\": it is the intersection of a ball and a plane passing through its center.\nIn higher dimensions, the great circles on the \"n\"-sphere are the intersection of the \"n\"-sphere with 2-planes that pass through the origin in the Euclidean space R\"n\" + 1.\nHalf of a great circle may be called a \"great semicircle\" (e.g., as in parts of a meridian in astronomy).\nDerivation of shortest paths.\nTo prove that the minor arc of a great circle is the shortest path connecting two points on the surface of a sphere, one can apply calculus of variations to it.\nConsider the class of all regular paths from a point formula_1 to another point formula_2. Introduce spherical coordinates so that formula_1 coincides with the north pole. Any curve on the sphere that does not intersect either pole, except possibly at the endpoints, can be parametrized by\nformula_4\nprovided formula_5 is allowed to take on arbitrary real values. The infinitesimal arc length in these coordinates is\n formula_6\nSo the length of a curve formula_7 from formula_1 to formula_2 is a functional of the curve given by\n formula_10\nAccording to the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation, formula_11 is minimized if and only if\nformula_12,\nwhere formula_13 is a formula_14-independent constant, and\nformula_15\nFrom the first equation of these two, it can be obtained that\nformula_16.\nIntegrating both sides and considering the boundary condition, the real solution of formula_13 is zero. Thus, formula_18 and formula_19 can be any value between 0 and formula_20, indicating that the curve must lie on a meridian of the sphere. In a Cartesian coordinate system, this is\nformula_21\nwhich is a plane through the origin, i.e., the center of the sphere.\nApplications.\nSome examples of great circles on the celestial sphere include the celestial horizon, the celestial equator, and the ecliptic. Great circles are also used as rather accurate approximations of geodesics on the Earth's surface for air or sea navigation (although it is not a perfect sphere), as well as on spheroidal celestial bodies.\nThe equator of the idealized earth is a great circle and any meridian and its opposite meridian form a great circle. Another great circle is the one that divides the land and water hemispheres. A great circle divides the earth into two hemispheres and if a great circle passes through a point it must pass through its antipodal point.\nThe Funk transform integrates a function along all great circles of the sphere.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48083", "revid": "233163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48083", "title": "Sesame Workshop", "text": "American children's media producer\nSesame Workshop (SW), originally known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), is an American nonprofit organization and television production company that has been responsible for the production of several educational children's programs\u2014including its first and best-known, \"Sesame Street\"\u2014that have been televised internationally. Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett developed the idea to form an organization to produce the \"Sesame Street\" television series. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed \"one of the most important television developments of the decade.\"\n\"Sesame Street\" premiered on National Educational Television (NET) as a series run in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service, in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. Gerald S. Lesser and Edward L. Palmer were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the \"CTW model\". The CTW applied this system to its other television series, including \"The Electric Company\" and \"3-2-1 Contact\". The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.\nFollowing the success of \"Sesame Street\", the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, and international co-productions. In 1999 the CTW partnered with MTV Networks to create an educational channel called Noggin. They sold their stake in the channel to Viacom (owner of MTV Networks) in 2002. The Workshop produced a variety of original series for Noggin, including \"The Upside Down Show\", \"Sponk!\" and \"Out There\". In June 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop to better represent its activities beyond television. \nBy 2005, income from the organization's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the \"Sesame Street\" Muppets accounted for $15\u201317 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Sherrie Westin is the president of the company, starting in 2021.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nDuring the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week. Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively. Children from low-income families, however, had fewer resources than children from higher-income families to prepare them for school. Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested \"substantially lower\" than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school. The topic of developmental psychology had grown during this period, and scientists were beginning to understand that changes of early childhood education could increase children's cognitive growth.\nIn the winter of 1966, Joan Ganz Cooney hosted what she called \"a little dinner party\" at her apartment near Gramercy Park. Attending were her husband Tim Cooney, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett, whom the Cooneys knew socially. Cooney was a producer of documentary films at New York public television station WNDT (now WNET), and won an Emmy for a documentary about poverty in America. Lloyd Morrisett was a vice-president at Carnegie Corporation, and was responsible for funding educational research, but had been frustrated in his efforts because they were unable to reach the large numbers of children in need of early education and intervention. Cooney was committed to using television to change society, and Morrisett was interested in using television to \"reach greater numbers of needy kids\". The conversation during the party, which according to writer Michael Davis was the start of a five-decade long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett, turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children. A week later, Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the office of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study for creating an educational television program for preschoolers. Cooney was chosen to perform the study.\nIn the summer of 1967, Cooney took a leave of absence from WNDT, and funded by Carnegie Corporation, traveled the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled \"The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education\". The report described what the new series, which became \"Sesame Street\", would be like and proposed the creation of a company that managed its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW).\nFounding.\nFor the next two years, Cooney and Morrisett researched and developed the new show, acquiring $8 million funding for \"Sesame Street\", and establishing the CTW. Due to her professional experience, Cooney always assumed the show's natural network would be PBS. Morrisett was amenable to broadcast it by commercial stations, but all three major networks rejected the idea. Davis, considering \"Sesame Street\"'s licensing income years later, termed their decision \"a billion-dollar blunder\". Morrisett was responsible for fund acquisition, and was so successful at it that writer Lee D. Mitgang later said that it \"defied conventional media wisdom\". Cooney was responsible for the show's creative development, and for hiring the production and research staff for the CTW. The Carnegie Corporation provided their initial $1 million grant, and Morrisett, using his contacts, procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Ford Foundation. Morrisett's friend Harold Howe, who was the commissioner for the U.S. Department of Education, promised $4 million, half of the new organization's budget. The Carnegie Corporation donated an additional $1 million. Mitgang stated, \"Had Morrisett been any less effective in lining up financial support, Cooney's report likely would have become just another long-forgotten foundation idea\". Funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic problems experienced by commercial networks, but caused difficulty for procuring future funding.\nCooney's proposal included using in-house formative research that would inform and improve production, and independent summative evaluations to test the show's effect on its young viewers' learning. In 1967, Morrisett recruited Harvard University professor Gerald S. Lesser, whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale, to help develop and lead the Workshop's research department. In 1972, the Markle Foundation donated $72,000 to Harvard to form the Center for Research in Children's Television, which served as a research agency for the CTW. Harvard produced about 20 major research studies about \"Sesame Street\" and its effect on young children. Lesser also served as the first chairman of the Workshop's advisory board, a position he held until his retirement in 1997. According to Lesser, the CTW's advisory board was unusual because instead of rubber-stamping the Workshop's decisions like most boards for other children's television shows, it contributed significantly to the series' design and implementation. Lesser reported in \"\", his 1974 book about the beginnings of \"Sesame Street\" and the Children's Television Workshop, that about 8\u201310% of the Workshop's initial budget was spent on research.\nCTW's summative research was done by the Workshop's first research director, Edward L. Palmer, whom they met at the curriculum seminars Lesser conducted in Boston in the summer of 1967. In the summer of 1968, Palmer began to create educational goals, define the Workshop's research activities, and hire his research team. Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U.S. studying the interaction of children and television at the time. They were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the \"CTW model\". Cooney observed of the CTW model: \"From the beginning, we\u2014the planners of the project\u2014designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners\". She described the collaboration as an \"arranged marriage\".\nThe CTW devoted 8% of its initial budget to outreach and publicity. In what television historian Robert W. Morrow called \"an extensive campaign\" that Lesser stated \"would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research\", the Workshop promoted the show with educators, the broadcast industry, and the show's target audience, which consisted of inner-city children and their families. They hired Evelyn Payne Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called \"remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable\", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and manager of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division. Bob Hatch was hired to publicize their new series, both before its premiere and to take advantage of the media attention concerning \"Sesame Street\" during its first year of production.\nAccording to Davis, despite her involvement with the project's initial research and development, Cooney's installment as CTW's executive director was questionable due to her lack of executive experience, untested financial management skills, and lack of experience with children's television and education. Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, \"Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries\". At first, Cooney did not fight for the position. However she had the help of her husband and Morrisett, and the project's investors soon realized they could not begin without her. She was eventually named to the post in February 1968. As one of the first female executives in American television, her appointment was termed \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\". The formation of the Children Television Workshop was announced at a press conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City on 20 May 1968.\nAfter her appointment, Cooney hired Bob Davidson as her assistant; he was responsible for making agreements with approximately 180 public television stations to broadcast the new series. She assembled a team of producers: Jon Stone was responsible for writing, casting, and format; David Connell assumed control of animation and volume production; and Samuel Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team. Stone, Connell, and Gibbon had worked on another children's show, \"Captain Kangaroo\", together. Cooney later said about \"Sesame Street\"'s original team of producers, \"collectively, we were a genius\". CTW's first children's show, \"Sesame Street\", premiered on 10 November 1969. The CTW was not incorporated until 1970 because its creators wanted to see if the series was a success before they hired lawyers and accountants. Morrisett served as the first chairperson of CTW's board of trustees, a job he had for 28 years.\nEarly years.\nDuring the second season of \"Sesame Street\", to capitalize on the momentum the Workshop was enjoying and the attention it received from the press, the Workshop created its second series, \"The Electric Company\", in 1971. Morrisett used the same fund-acquisition techniques as he had used for \"Sesame Street\". \"The Electric Company\" stopped production in 1977, but continued in reruns until 1985; it eventually became one of the most widely used TV shows in American classrooms and was revived in 2009. Starting in the early 1970s, the Workshop ventured into adult programming, but found that it was difficult to make their programs accessible to all socio-economic groups. In 1971, it produced a medical program for adults termed \"Feelin' Good\", hosted by Dick Cavett, which was broadcast on public television until 1974. According to writer Cary O'Dell, the show \"lacked a clear direction and never found a large audience\". In 1977, the Workshop broadcast an adult drama called \"Best of Families\", which was set in New York City around the turn of the 20th century. However, it lasted for only six or seven episodes and helped the Workshop decide to emphasize children's programs only.\nThroughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts changed from promotion to the development of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. In the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting in 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.\nAccording to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were a problematic period for the Workshop. A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially. Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s to work on their licensing agreements, but he was unable to compensate for the CTW's losses until 1986, when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased. Despite financial troubles, the Workshop continued to produce new shows throughout the decade. \"3-2-1 Contact\" premiered in 1980 and ran for seven seasons. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like \"Square One Television\", which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education.\nLater years.\nCooney stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of the CTW in 1990, when she was replaced by David Britt, who was her \"chief lieutenant in the executive ranks through the mid-1990s\" and whom Cooney termed her \"right-hand for many years\". Britt had worked for her at the CTW since 1975 and had served as its president and chief operating officer since 1988. At that time, Cooney became chairman of the Workshop's executive board, which managed its businesses and licensing, and became more involved with the organization's creative efforts. The Workshop had a reorganization in 1995, and dismissed about 12 percent of its staff. In 1998, for the first time in the series' history, they accepted funds from corporations for \"Sesame Street\" and its other programs, a policy criticized by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. The Workshop defended the acceptance of corporate sponsorship, stating that it compensated for a decrease of government subsidies.\nAlso in 1998, the CTW invested $25 million in an educational cable channel called Noggin. Noggin was a joint venture between the CTW and Viacom's MTV Networks, and launched on February 2, 1999. Gary Knell explained that creating a new channel allowed the CTW to more easily \"ensure that our programming gets out there.\" While the Workshop would eventually produce various new shows for Noggin, the channel's early lineup consisted mostly of older shows from the CTW's library.\nIn 2000, profits earned from the Noggin deal, along with the revenue caused partly by the \"Tickle Me Elmo\" craze, enabled the CTW to purchase The Jim Henson Company's rights to the \"Sesame Street\" Muppets from the German media company EM.TV, which had acquired Henson earlier that year. The transaction, valued at $180 million, also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel. Gary Knell stated, \"Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled that we were able to bring them home. It protected \"Sesame Street\" and allowed our international expansion to continue. Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential. We are now in control of our own destiny\".\nSesame Workshop is the new name for the Children's Television Workshop on June 5, 2000, to better represent its non-television activities and interactive media. Also on June 5, 2000, Gary Knell succeeded Britt as president and CEO of the Workshop; according to Davis, he \"presided over an especially fertile period in the nonprofit's history\". Under Knell's management, Sesame Workshop produced a variety of original shows for Noggin. The first was an interactive game show called \"Sponk!\", which was meant to model good collaboration and teamwork skills. Sesame Workshop also co-produced a \"Sesame Street\" spin-off, \"Play with Me Sesame\", for Noggin. On April 1, 2002, Noggin premiered an overnight block for teenagers called The N. Sesame Workshop created its first-ever teen drama series, \"Out There\", for The N.\nIn August 2002, Sesame Workshop sold its 50% share of Noggin to Viacom. The buyout was partially caused by SW's need to pay off debt. Sesame Workshop remained involved with the network's programming, as Viacom entered a multi-year production deal with Sesame Workshop shortly after the split and continued to broadcast the company's shows. The last collaboration between Noggin and Sesame Workshop was \"The Upside Down Show\", which premiered in 2006.\nOutside of Noggin, Knell was instrumental in the creation of the cable channel Sprout (now Universal Kids, shutting down in March 2025) in 2005. Sprout (launched as PBS Kids Sprout) was founded as a partnership between the Workshop, Comcast, PBS, and HIT Entertainment, all of whom contributed older programming from their archive libraries to the new network. After seven years as a partner, the Workshop divested its stake in Sprout to NBCUniversal in December 2012.\nIn 2007, the Sesame Workshop founded The Joan Ganz Cooney Center, an independent, non-profit organization that studies how to improve children's literacy by using and developing digital technologies \"grounded in detailed educational curriculum\", just as was done during the development of \"Sesame Street\".\nThe 2008\u20132009 recession, which resulted in budget reductions for many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected the organization; in 2009, it had to dismiss 20% of its staff. Despite earning about $100 million from licensing revenue, royalties, and foundation and government funding in 2012, the Workshop's total revenue was down 15% and its operating loss doubled to $24.3 million. In 2013, it responded by dismissing 10% of its staff, saying that it was necessary to \"strategically focus\" their resources because of \"today's rapidly changing digital environment\". In 2011, Knell left Sesame Workshop to become the chief executive of National Public Radio (NPR). H. Melvin Ming, who had been the organization's chief financial officer since 1999 and chief operating officer since 2002, was named as his replacement. In 2014, H. Melvin Ming retired and was succeeded by former HIT Entertainment and Nickelodeon executive Jeffery D. Dunn. Dunn's appointment was the first time someone not affiliated with CTW or Sesame Workshop became its manager, although he had associations with the organization previously. In 2021, Dunn retired. It was replaced by Sherrie Rollins Westin, who had served as president of SW's Social Impact and Philanthropy Division for six years.\nIn 2019, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that Sesame Workshop's operating income was approximately $1.6 million, after the majority of its funds earned from grants, licensing deals, and royalties went back into its content, its total operating costs were over $100 million per year. Operating costs included salaries, $6 million in rent for its Lincoln Center corporate offices, its production facilities in Queens, and the costs of producing content for its YouTube channels and other outlets. The organization employed about 400 people, including \"several highly skilled puppeteers\". Royalties and distribution fees, which accounted for $52.9 million in 2018, made up the Workshop's biggest revenue source. Donations brought in $47.8 million, or 31 percent of its income. Licensing revenue from games, toys, and clothing earned the organization $4.5 million.\nOn March 6, 2025, Sesame Workshop announced its plans to significantly downsize and restructure its operations in the wake of Warner Bros. Discovery's decision not to renew its U.S. distribution deal for \"Sesame Street\" as well as policy changes affecting the organization's federal funding. \"Sesame Street\" would later be picked up by Netflix on May 20, 2025.\nFunding sources.\nAfter \"Sesame Street\"'s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since its funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Although the organization was what Cooney termed \"the darling of the federal government for a brief period of two or three years\", its first ten years of existence was marked by conflicts between the two; in 1978, the US Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of the CTW's fiscal year. According to Davis, the federal government was opposed to funding public television, but the Workshop used Cooney's prestige and fame, and the fact that there would be \"great public outcry\" if the series was de-funded, to withstand the government's attacks on PBS. Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget. By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop's budget, or less than $5 million a year.\nFor the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money. Immediately after its premiere, \"Sesame Street \"gained attention from marketers, so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a \"multiple media institution\". Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow stated, the Sesame Workshop endowment, which had the potential to fund the organization and future productions and projects. Muppet creator Jim Henson owned the trademarks to the Muppet characters: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of \"Sesame Street\". As Davis reported, \"Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution\" in their marketing and licensing efforts. In the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with Random House to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named Christopher Cerf to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the series' curriculum. By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had over 500 licensing agreements, and its total revenue in 2018 was $35 million. A million children play with \"Sesame Street\"-themed toys per day.\nSoon after the premiere of \"Sesame Street\", producers, educators, and officials of other nations began requesting that a version of the series be broadcast in their countries. CBS executive Michael Dann was required to quit his job at that network due to a change of corporate policy preceding the so-called \"rural purge\"; upon his ouster, he became vice-president of the CTW and Cooney's assistant. Dann then began developing foreign versions of \"Sesame Street\" by arranging what were eventually termed co-productions, or independent programs with their own sets, characters, and curriculum goals. By 2009, \"Sesame Street\" had expanded into 140 countries; \"The New York Times\" reported in 2005 that income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the \"Sesame Street\" Muppets accounted for between $15 million and $17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees, divided between the Workshop and Henson Associates. The Workshop began pursuing funding from corporate sponsors in 1998; consumer advocate Ralph Nader urged parents to protest the move by boycotting the show. In 2018 the Workshop made a deal with Apple to develop original content including puppet series for Apple's streaming service. In 2019, \"Parade Magazine\" reported that the organization had received two $100 million grants from the MacArthur Foundation and from the LEGO Foundation; the funds were used to undertake \"the largest early childhood intervention in the history of humanitarian response to help refugee children and families\".\nPublishing.\nIn 1970, the CTW established a department managing the development of \"nonbroadcast\" materials based upon \"Sesame Street\". The Workshop decided that all materials its licensing program created would \"underscore and amplify\" the series' curriculum. Coloring books, for example, were prohibited because the Workshop felt they would restrict children's imaginations. CTW published \"Sesame Street Magazine\" in 1970, which incorporated the show's curriculum goals in a magazine format. As with the series, research was performed for the magazine, initially by CTW's research department for a year and a half, and then by the Magazine Research Group in 1975.\nWorking with Random House editor Jason Epstein, the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to manage \"Sesame Street\"'s book publishing program. During the division's first year, Cerf earned $900,000 for the CTW. He quit to become more involved with writing and composing music for the series, and was replaced eventually by Bill Whaley. Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW in 2000, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model used by other children's series. As of 2019, the Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles. and as researcher Renee Cherow-O'Leary stated in 2001, \"the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street\". In one of these books, for example, the death of the \"Sesame Street\" character Mr. Hooper was featured in a book entitled \"I'll Miss You, Mr. Hooper\", published soon after the series featured it in 1983. In 2019, \"Parade Magazine\" reported that 20 million copies of \"\" and \"Another Monster at the End of this Book\" had been sold, making them the top two best-selling e-books sold. Its YouTube channel had almost 5 million subscribers.\nMusic.\nAccording to director Jon Stone, the music of \"Sesame Street\" was unlike any other children's program on television. For the first time, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and was related to its curriculum. Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an \"affinity for commercial jingles\", so many of the show's songs were like television advertisements.\nTo attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the series, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, \"helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show\". Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts. Songwriters of note were Joe Raposo, Jeff Moss, Christopher Cerf, Tony Geiss, and Norman Stiles. Many of the songs written for \"Sesame Street\" have become what writer David Borgenicht termed \"timeless classics\". These songs included \"Can You Tell Me How to Get to Sesame Street?\", \"I Love Trash\", \"Rubber Duckie\", \"Bein' Green\", and \"Sing\". Many \"Sesame Street\" songs were recorded by well-known artists such as Barbra Streisand, Lena Horne, Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Simon, and Jose Feliciano. By 2019, there were 180 albums of \"Sesame Street\" music produced.\nThe show's first album, \"Sesame Street Book &amp; Record\", recorded in 1970, was a major success and won a Grammy Award. \"Parade Magazine\" reported in 2019 that the show's music had been honored with 11 children's Grammys. According to Gikow, Raposo won three Emmys and four Grammys for his work for the series.\nInternational co-productions.\nSoon after \"Sesame Street\" debuted in the US, the CTW was asked independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the series in their countries. Cooney remarked, \"To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created\". She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who quit commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of \"Sesame Street\" in other countries. In response to Dann's appointment, television critic Marvin Kitman said, \"After [Dann] sells [\"Sesame Street\"] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV\". This was a reference to the May 1970 decision by the state's PBS station to not air the series. By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term \"co-productions\".\nThe earliest international versions were what CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole and her colleagues termed \"fairly simple\", consisting of dubbed versions of the series with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Dubbed versions of the series continued to be produced if the country's needs and resources warranted it. Eventually, a variant of the CTW model was used to create and produce independently produced preschool television series in other countries. By 2006, there were twenty co-productions. In 2001, there were more than 120 million viewers of all international versions of \"Sesame Street\", and by the show's 50th anniversary in 2019, 190 million children viewed over 160 versions of \"Sesame Street\" in 70 languages. In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of \"The New York Times\" reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million. As Cole and her colleagues reported in 2000, \"Children's Television Workshop (CTW) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world\".\nInteractive media.\nTen years after the premiere of \"Sesame Street\", the CTW began experimenting with new technologies. In 1979, it began to plan the development of a theme park, Sesame Place, which opened in 1980 in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Three international parks, \"Parque Plaza Sesamo\" in Monterrey, Mexico since 1995, Universal Studios Japan, and \"Vila Sesamo\" Kids' Land in Brazil were later built. One of the park's features was a computer gallery, which was developed by a small in-house team and included 55 computer programs. The team evolved into the Children's Computer Workshop (CCW) in 1982, which was disbanded and became the Interactive Technologies division of the CTW in the late 1980s. As \"Sesame Street\" researcher Shalom M. Fisch stated, no television series could be as interactive as computer games, even \"participatory\" shows like \"Blue's Clues\" or the \"Sesame Street\" segment \"Elmo's World\". The CTW has chosen to take advantage of the contingent feedback inherent in interactive computer games by developing and creating educational software based upon the television series' content and curriculum.\nIn 2008, Sesame Workshop began to offer clips and full-length episodes on the websites Hulu, YouTube, and iTunes, where \"Word on the Street\" segments became the most popular webcast. Sesame Workshop won a Peabody Award in 2009 for its website, sesamestreet.org. In 2010, the Workshop began offering, for a subscription fee, a library of over 100 eBooks. The on-line publishing platform was managed by the electronic publishing company Impelsys.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As the number of virtual teams has grown, facilitated by the Internet, globalization, outsourcing, and remote work, the need to manage them has also grown. The challenging task of managing these teams have been made much easier by availability of online collaboration tools, adaptive project management software, efficient time tracking programs and other related systems and tools. This article provides information concerning some of the important management factors involved with virtual teams, and the life cycle of managing a virtual team.\nDue to developments in information technology within the workplace, along with a need to compete globally and address competitive demands, organizations have embraced virtual management structures. As in face-to-face teams, management of virtual teams is also a crucial component in the effectiveness of the team. However, when compared to leaders of face-to-face teams, virtual team leaders face the following difficulties: (a) logistical problems, including coordination of work across different time zones and physical distances; (b) interpersonal issues, including an ability to establish effective working relationships in the absence of frequent face-to-face communication; and (c) technological difficulties, including finding and learning to use appropriate technology. In global virtual teams, there is an additional dimension of cultural differences which impact on a virtual team's functioning.\nManagement factors.\nFor the team to reap the benefits mentioned above, the manager considers the following factors.\nTrust and leader effectiveness.\nA virtual team leader must ensure a feeling of trust among all team members\u2014something all team members have an influence on and must be aware of. However, the team leader is responsible for this in the first place. Team leaders must ensure a sense of psychological safety within a team by allowing all members to speak honestly and directly, but respectfully, to each other.\nFor a team to succeed, the manager must schedule meetings to ensure participation. This carries over to the realm of virtual teams, but in this case these meetings are also virtual. Due to the difficulties of communicating in a virtual team, it is imperative that team members attend meetings. The first team meeting is crucial and establishes lasting precedents for the team. Furthermore, there are numerous features of a virtual team environment that may impact on the development of follower trust. The team members have to trust that the leader is allocating work fairly and evaluating team members equally.\nAn extensive study conducted over 8 years examined what factors increase leader effectiveness in virtual teams. One such factor is that virtual team leaders need to spend more time than conventional team counterparts being explicit about expectations. This is due to the patterns of behavior and dynamics of interaction which are unfamiliar. Moreover, even in information rich virtual teams using video conferencing, it is hard to replicate the rapid exchange of information and cues available in face-to-face discussions. To develop role clarity within virtual teams, leaders should focus on developing: (a) clear objectives and goals for tasks; (b) comprehensive milestones for deliverables; and (c) communication channels for seeking feedback on unclear role guidance.\nWhen determining an effective way of leadership for a culturally diverse team there are various ways: directive (from directive to participatory), transactional (rewarding) or transformational influence. Leadership must ensure effective communication and understanding, clear and shared plans and task assignments and collective sense of belonging in team. Further, the role of a team leader is to coordinate tasks and activities, motivate team members, facilitate collaboration and solve conflicts when needed. This proofs that a team leader's role in effective virtual team management and creating knowledge sharing environment is crucial.\nPresence and instruction.\nVirtual team leaders must become virtually present so they can closely monitor team members and note changes that might affect their ability to undertake their tasks. Due to the distributed nature of virtual teams, team members have less awareness of the wider situation of the team or dynamics of the overall team environment. Consequently, as situations change in a virtual team environment, such as adjustments to task requirements, modification of milestones, or changes to the goals of the team, it is important that leaders monitor followers to ensure they are aware of these changes and make amendments as required. The leaders of virtual teams do not possess the same powers of physical observation, and have to be creative in setting up structures and processes so that variations from expectations can be observed well virtually (for instance, virtual team leaders have to sense when \"electronic\" silence means acquiescence rather than inattention). At the same time, leaders of virtual teams cannot assume that members are prepared for virtual meetings and also have to ensure that the unique knowledge of each distributed person on the virtual team is fully utilized. Virtual team leaders should be aware that information overload may result in situations when a leader has provided too much information to a team member.\nVirtuality.\nFinally, when examining virtual teams, it is crucial to consider that they differ in terms of their virtuality. Virtuality refers to a continuum of how \"virtual\" a team is. There are three predominant factors that contribute to virtuality, namely: (a) the richness of communication media; (b) distance between team members, both in time zones and geographical dispersion; and (c) organizational and cultural diversity.\nDetriments.\nIn the field of managing virtual research and development (R&amp;D) teams there have arisen certain detriments to the management decisions made when leading a team. The first of these detriments is the lack of potential for radical innovation, this is brought about by the lack of affinity with certain technologies or processes. This causes a decrease in certainty about the feasibility of the execution. As a result, virtual R&amp;D teams focus on incremental innovations. The second detriment is the nature of the project may need to change. Depending on how interdependent each step is, the ability for a virtual team to successfully complete the project varies at each step. Thirdly, the sharing of knowledge, which was identified above as an important ingredient in managing a virtual team, becomes even more important albeit difficult. There is some knowledge and information that is simple and easy to explain and share, but there is other knowledge that may be more content or domain specific that is not so easy to explain. In a face to face group this can be done by walking a team member through the topic slowly during a lunch break, but in a virtual team this is no longer possible and the information is at risk of being misunderstood leading to set backs in the project. Finally, the distribution and bundling of resources is also very much altered by the move from collocation to virtual space. Where once the team was all in one place and the resources could be split there as needed, now the team can be anywhere, and the same resources still need to get to the correct people. This takes time, effort, and coordination to avoid potential setbacks or conflicts.\nLife cycle.\nTo effectively use the management factors described above, it is important to know when in the life cycle of a virtual team they would be most useful. According to the life cycle of virtual team management includes five stages:\nPreparations.\nThe initial task during the implementation of a team is the definition of the general purpose of the team together with the determination of the level of virtuality that might be appropriate to achieve these goals. These decisions are usually determined by strategic factors such as mergers, increase of the market span, cost reductions, flexibility and reactivity to the market, etc. Management-related activities that should take place during preparation phase includes mission statement, personnel selection, task design, rewards system design, choose appropriate technology and organizational integration.\nIn regards to personnel selection, virtual teams have an advantage. To maximize outcomes, management wants the best team it can have. Before virtual teams, they did this by gathering the \"best available\" workers and forming a team. These teams did not contain the best workers of the field, because they were busy with their own projects, or were too far away to meet the group. With virtual teams, managers can select personnel from anywhere in the world, and so from a wider pool.\nLaunch.\nIt is highly recommended that, in the beginning of virtual teamwork, all members should meet each other face to face. Crucial elements of such a \"kick-off\" workshop are getting acquainted with the other team members, clarifying the team goals, clarifying the roles and functions of the team members, information and training how communication technologies can be used efficiently, and developing general rules for the teamwork. As a consequence, \"kick-off\" workshops are expected to promote clarification of team processes, trust building, building of a shared interpretive context, and high identification with the team.\nGetting acquainted, goal clarification and development of intra-team rules should also be accomplished during this phase. Initial field data that compare virtual teams with and without such \"kick-off\" meetings confirm a general positive effects on team effectiveness, although more differentiated research is necessary. Experimental studies demonstrate that getting acquainted before the start of computer-mediated work facilitates cooperation and trust.\nOne of the manager's roles during launch is to create activities or events that allow for team building. These kickoff events should serve three major goals: everyone on the team is well versed in the technology involved, everyone knows what is expected of them and when it is expected, and finally have everyone get to know one another. By meeting all three goals the virtual team may be far more successful, and it lightens everyone's load.\nPerformance management.\nAfter the launch of a virtual team, work effectiveness and a constructive team climate has to be maintained using performance management strategies. These comprehensive management strategies arise from the agreed upon difficulty of working in virtual teams. Research shows that constructs and expectations of team membership, leadership, goal setting, social loafing and conflict differ in cultural groups and therefore affects team performance a lot. In early team formation process, one thing to agree on within a team is the meaning of leadership and role differentiation for the team leader and other team members. To apply this, the leader must show active leadership to create a shared conceptualization of team meaning, its focus and function.\nThe following discussion is again restricted to issues on which empirical results are already available. These issues are leadership, communication within virtual teams, team members' motivation, and knowledge management.\nLeadership is a central challenge in virtual teams. Particularly, all kinds of direct control are difficult when team managers are not at the same location as the team members. As a consequence, delegative management principles are considered that shift parts of classic managerial functions to the team members. However, team members only accept and fulfill such managerial functions when they are motivated and identify with the team and its goals, which is again more difficult to achieve in virtual teams. Next, empirical results on three leadership approaches are summarized that differ in the degree of autonomy of the team members: Electronic monitoring as an attempt to realize directive leadership over distance, management by objectives (MBO) as an example for delegative leadership principles, and self-managing teams as an example for rather autonomous teamwork.\nOne way to maintain control over a virtual team is through motivators and incentives. Both are common techniques implemented by managers for collocated teams, but with slight adjustments they can be used effectively for virtual teams as well. A commonly held belief is that working online, is not particularly important or impactful. This belief can be changed by notifying employees that their work is being sent to the managers. This attaches the importance of career prospects to the work, and makes it more meaningful for the workers.\nCommunication processes are perhaps the most frequently investigated variables relevant for the regulation of virtual teamwork. By definition, communication in virtual teams is predominantly based on electronic media such as e-mail, telephone, video-conference, etc. The main concern here is that electronic media reduce the richness of information exchange compared to face-to-face communication. This difference in richness of information is an idea shared by multiple researchers, and there are some methods to move around the drop created by working in a virtual environment. One such method is to use the anonymity provided by working digitally. It lets people share concerns without worrying about being identified. This serves to over come the lack of richness by providing a safe method to honestly provide feedback and information. Predominant research issues have been conflict escalation and disinhibited communication (\"flaming\"), the fit between communication media and communication contents, and the role of non-job-related communication. These research issues revolve around the idea that people become more hostile over a virtual medium making the working environment unhealthy. These findings were quickly dismissed in the presence of virtual teams due to the fact that virtual teams have the expectation that one will work longer together, and the level of anonymity is different from just a one off online interaction. One of the important needs for successful communication is the ability to have every member of the group together repeatedly over time. Effective dispersed groups show spikes in presence during communication over time, while ineffective groups do not have as dramatic spikes.\nFor the management of motivational and emotional processes, three groups of such processes have been addressed in empirical investigations so far: motivation and trust, team identification and cohesion, and satisfaction of the team members. Since most of the variables are originated within the person, they can vary considerably among the members of a team, requiring appropriate aggregation procedures for multilevel analyses (e.g. motivation may be mediated by interpersonal trust.).\nSystematic research is needed on the management of knowledge and the development of shared understanding within the teams, particularly since theoretical analyses sometimes lead to conflicting expectations. The development of such \"common ground\" might be particularly difficult in virtual teams because sharing of information and the development of a \"transactive memory\" (i.e., who knows what in the team) is harder due to the reduced amount of face-to-face communication and the reduced information about individual work contexts.\nTeam development.\nVirtual teams can be supported by personnel and team development interventions. The development of such training concepts should be based on an empirical assessment of the needs and/or deficits of the team and its members, and the effectiveness of the trainings should be evaluated empirically. The steps of team developments include assessment of needs/deficits, individual and team training, and evaluation of training effects.\nOne such development intervention is to have the virtual team self-facilitate. Normally, a team brings in an outside facilitator to ensure that the team is correctly using the technology. This is a costly method of developing the team, but virtual teams can self-facilitate. This lessens the need for an outside facilitator, and saves the team time, effort, and resources.\nDisbanding and reintegration.\nFinally, the disbanding of virtual teams and the re-integration of the team members is an important issue that has been neglected not only in empirical but also in most of the conceptual work on virtual teams. However, particularly when virtual project teams have only a short life-time and reform again quickly, careful and constructive disbanding is mandatory to maintain high motivation and satisfaction among the employees. Members of transient project teams anticipate the end of the teamwork in the foreseeable future, which in turn overshadows the interaction and shared outcomes. The final stage of group development should be a gradual emotional disengagement that includes both sadness about separation and (at least in successful groups) joy and pride in the achievements of the team.\nPandemic factor.\nPost pandemic the virtual team concept has been further popularized although even before the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations were actively shifting toward remote work. As per market sources, around 80% of global corporate remote work policies had shifted to virtual and mixed forms of team collaboration during the pandemic. With the onslaught of worldwide lockdowns and challenging time management, remote work has become a necessity for the majority and virtual management has become a way of life for business owners/leaders. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His reign saw Gwynedd transformed from a territory suffering from thirty years of civil war into a polity which could exercise suzerainty over most other native Welsh rulers. He received official recognition of his status from the English Crown, but experienced difficulty establishing lasting control over his ostensible vassals and struggled to ensure a smooth succession for his chosen heir, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, son of Llywelyn and Joan, a daughter of King John. He suffered a paralytic stroke in 1237, and died on 11 April 1240, leaving Dafydd to succeed him to the precarious principality.\nDuring Llywelyn's childhood, Gwynedd was ruled by two of his uncles, who split the kingdom between them, following the death of Llywelyn's grandfather, Owain Gwynedd, in 1170. Llywelyn began a campaign to win power at an early age, battling his uncles Rhodri and Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd. Rhodri died in 1195, and Gruffudd and Maredudd ap Cynan took over his lands in Gwynedd Uwch Conwy. Dafydd ab Owain was captured by Llywelyn in 1197 and subsequently exiled to England. Llywelyn secured his grip on the throne of Gwynedd when drove his cousins Gruffudd and Maredudd ap Cynan from Gwynedd Uwch Conwy in the wake of a battle in Arfon on Epiphany 1199. He then made a treaty with King John in 1200. Llywelyn's relations with John remained good for the next ten years. He married John's natural daughter Joan in 1205, and when John arrested Gwenwynwyn of Powys in 1208, Llywelyn took the opportunity to annex southern Powys. In 1210, relations deteriorated, and John invaded Gwynedd in 1211. Llywelyn was forced to seek terms and to give up all lands east of the River Conwy but was able to recover them the following year in alliance with the other Welsh princes. He allied himself with the barons who forced John to sign Magna Carta in 1215. By 1216, he was the dominant power in Wales, holding a council at Aberdyfi that year to apportion lands to the other princes.\nFollowing King John's death, Llywelyn concluded the Treaty of Worcester with his successor, Henry III, in 1218. During the next fifteen years, Llywelyn was frequently involved in fights with Marcher lords and sometimes with the king, but also made alliances with several major powers in the Marches. The Peace of Middle in 1234 marked the end of Llywelyn's military career, as the agreed truce of two years was extended year by year for the remainder of his reign. He maintained his position in Wales until his death in 1240 and was succeeded by his son Dafydd ap Llywelyn.\nEarly life.\nLlywelyn was born about 1173, the son of Iorwerth Drwyndwn and the grandson of Owain Gwynedd, who had been ruler of Gwynedd until his death in 1170. He was probably born at Dolwyddelan the royal manor of Nantconwy, though not in the present Dolwyddelan Castle, which was built by Llywelyn himself. He may have been born in the old castle which occupied a rocky knoll on the valley floor.\nLittle is known about his father, Iorwerth Drwyndwn, who died when Llywelyn was an infant. There is no record of Iorwerth having taken part in the power struggle between some of Owain Gwynedd's other sons following Owain's death, although he was the eldest surviving son. There is a tradition that he was disabled or disfigured in some way that excluded him from power.\nJohn Edward Lloyd states that Iorwerth was killed in battle at Pennant Melangell, in Powys, in 1174 during the wars deciding the succession following the death of his father.\nBy 1175, Gwynedd had been divided between two of Llywelyn's uncles. Dafydd ab Owain held the area east of the River Conwy and Rhodri ab Owain held the west. Dafydd and Rhodri were the sons of Owain by his second marriage to Cristin verch Goronwy. This marriage was not considered valid by the church as Cristin was Owain's first cousin, a degree of relationship which according to Canon law prohibited marriage. The chronicler Gerald of Wales refers to Iorwerth Drwyndwn as the only legitimate son of Owain Gwynedd. Following Iorwerth's death, Llywelyn was, at least in the eyes of the church, the legitimate claimant to the throne of Gwynedd.\nLlywelyn's mother was Marared, occasionally anglicised to Margaret, daughter of Madog ap Maredudd, prince of Powys. There is evidence that after Iorwerth's death Marared married into the Corbet family of Caux in Shropshire, and Llywelyn may have spent part of his childhood there. There is in existence a grant of land from Llywelyn ab Iorwerth to the monastery of Wigmore, in which Llywelyn indicates his mother was a member of the \nhouse of Corbet.\nRise to power 1188\u20131199.\nIn his account of his journey around Wales in 1188, Gerald mentions that the young Llywelyn was already in arms against his uncles Dafydd and Rhodri:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 1194, with the aid of his cousins Gruffudd ap Cynan and Maredudd ap Cynan, he defeated Dafydd at the Battle of Aberconwy at the mouth of the River Conwy.\nRhodri died in 1195, and his lands west of the Conwy were taken over by Gruffudd and Maredudd, while Llywelyn ruled the territories taken from Dafydd east of the Conwy. In 1197, Llywelyn captured Dafydd and imprisoned him. A year later Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, persuaded Llywelyn to release him, and Dafydd retired to England, where he died in May 1203.\nWales was divided into \"Pura Wallia\", the areas ruled by the Welsh princes, and \"Marchia Wallia\", ruled by the Anglo-Norman barons. Since the death of Owain Gwynedd in 1170, Rhys ap Gruffydd had made the southern kingdom of Deheubarth the strongest of the Welsh kingdoms, and had established himself as the leader of \"Pura Wallia\". After Rhys died in 1197, fighting between his sons led to the splitting of Deheubarth between warring factions. Gwenwynwyn, prince of Powys Wenwynwyn, tried to take over as leader of the Welsh princes, and in 1198, raised a great army to besiege Painscastle, which was held by the troops of William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber. Llywelyn sent troops to help Gwenwynwyn, but in August Gwenwynwyn's force was attacked by an army led by the justiciar, Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex, and heavily defeated. This evidently was not a great setback for Llywelyn, as on Epiphany 1199 he captured the important castle of Mold, Flintshire on the same day as a great battle in Arfon which saw his cousins Gruffudd and Maredudd ap Cynan driven out from Gwynedd Uwch Conwy and reduced to Meirionnydd, Eifionydd, and Ll\u0177n. The following day, he issued a charter to Aberconwy Abbey using the title \"prince of the whole of North Wales\" ().\nReign as Prince of Gwynedd.\nConsolidation 1200\u20131209.\nGruffudd ap Cynan ab Owain Gwynedd died in 1200 as a monk in Aberconwy Abbey. In 1201, Llywelyn took Eifionydd and Ll\u0177n from Maredudd ap Cynan on a charge of treachery. In July, the same year Llywelyn concluded a treaty with King John of England. This is the earliest surviving written agreement between an English king and a Welsh ruler, and under its terms, Llywelyn was to swear fealty and do homage to the king. In return, it confirmed Llywelyn's possession of his conquests and allowed cases relating to lands claimed by Llywelyn to be heard under Welsh law.\nLlywelyn made his first move beyond the borders of Gwynedd in August 1202 when he raised a force to attack Gwenwynwyn ab Owain Cyfeiliog of Powys, who was now his main rival in Wales. The clergy intervened to make peace between Llywelyn and Gwenwynwyn and the invasion was called off. Elise ap Madog, lord of Penllyn, had refused to respond to Llywelyn's summons to arms and was stripped of almost all his lands by Llywelyn as punishment.\nLlywelyn consolidated his position in 1205 by marrying Joan, Lady of Wales, the natural daughter of King John. He had previously been negotiating with Pope Innocent III for leave to marry his uncle Rhodri's widow, daughter of R\u01ebgnvaldr Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0arson, King of the Isles. However, this proposal was dropped.\nIn 1208, Gwenwynwyn of Powys fell out with King John who summoned him to Shrewsbury in October and then arrested him and stripped him of his lands. Llywelyn took the opportunity to annex southern Powys and northern Ceredigion and rebuild Aberystwyth Castle. In the summer of 1209 he accompanied John on a campaign against King William the Lion, Scotland.\nSetback and recovery 1210\u20131217.\nIn 1210, relations between Llywelyn and King John deteriorated. John Edward Lloyd suggests that the rupture may have been due to Llywelyn forming an alliance with William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber, who had fallen out with the king and had been deprived of his lands. While John led a campaign against de Braose and his allies in Ireland, an army led by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, and Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester, invaded Gwynedd. Llywelyn destroyed his own castle at Deganwy and retreated west of the River Conwy. The Earl of Chester rebuilt Deganwy, and Llywelyn retaliated by ravaging the Earl's lands. John sent troops to help restore Gwenwynwyn to the rule of southern Powys. In 1211, John invaded Gwynedd with the aid of almost all the other Welsh princes, planning according to \"Brut y Tywysogion\" \"to dispossess Llywelyn and destroy him utterly\". The first invasion was forced to retreat, but in August that year John invaded again with a larger army, crossed the River Conwy and penetrated Snowdonia. Bangor was burnt by a detachment of the royal army and the Bishop of Bangor captured. Llywelyn was forced to come to terms, and by the advice of his council sent his wife Joan to negotiate with the king, her father. Joan was able to persuade her father not to dispossess her husband completely, but Llywelyn lost all his lands east of the River Conwy. He also had to pay a large tribute in cattle and horses and to hand over hostages, including his illegitimate son Gruffudd and was forced to agree that if he died without a legitimate heir by Joan, all his lands would revert to the king.\nThis was the low point of Llywelyn's reign, but he quickly recovered his position. The other Welsh princes, who had supported King John against Llywelyn, soon became disillusioned with John's rule and changed sides. Llywelyn formed an alliance with Gwenwynwyn of Powys and the two main rulers of Deheubarth, Maelgwn ap Rhys and Rhys Gryg, and rose against John. They had the support of Pope Innocent III, who had been engaged in a dispute with John for several years and had placed his kingdom under an interdict. Innocent III released Llywelyn, Gwenwynwyn and Maelgwn from all oaths of loyalty to John and lifted the interdict in the territories which they controlled. Llywelyn was able to recover all Gwynedd apart from the castles of Deganwy and Rhuddlan within two months in 1212.\nJohn planned another invasion of Gwynedd in August 1212. According to one account, he had just commenced by hanging some of the Welsh hostages given the previous year when he received two letters. One was from his daughter Joan, Llywelyn's wife, the other from William I of Scotland (William the Lion), and both warned him in similar terms that if he invaded Wales his magnates would seize the opportunity to kill him or hand him over to his enemies. The invasion was abandoned, and in 1213, Llywelyn took the castles of Deganwy and Rhuddlan. Llywelyn made an alliance with Philip II Augustus of France, then allied himself with the barons who were in rebellion against John, marching on Shrewsbury and capturing it without resistance in 1215. When John was forced to sign Magna Carta, Llywelyn was rewarded with several favourable provisions relating to Wales, including the release of his son, Gruffudd, who had been a hostage since 1211. The same year, Ednyfed Fychan was appointed seneschal of Gwynedd and was to work closely with Llywelyn for the remainder of his reign.\nLlywelyn had now established himself as the leader of the independent princes of Wales, and in December 1215, led an army which included all the lesser princes to capture the castles of Carmarthen, Kidwelly, Llanstephan, Cardigan and Cilgerran. Another indication of his growing power was that he was able to insist on the consecration of Welshmen to two vacant sees that year, Iorwerth, as Bishop of St Davids, and Cadwgan of Llandyfai, as Bishop of Bangor.\nIn 1216, Llywelyn held a council at Aberdyfi to adjudicate on the territorial claims of the lesser princes, who affirmed their homage and allegiance to Llywelyn. J. Beverley Smith comments: \"The leader in military alliance assumed the role of lord, his erstwhile allies were now his vassals.\" Gwenwynwyn of Powys changed sides again that year and allied himself with King John. Llywelyn called up the other princes for a campaign against him and drove him out of southern Powys once more. Gwenwynwyn died in England later that year, leaving an underage heir. King John also died that year, and he also left an underage heir in King Henry III with a minority government set up in England.\nIn 1217, Reginald de Braose of Brecon and Abergavenny, who had been allied to Llywelyn and married his daughter, Gwladus Ddu, was induced by the English crown to change sides. Llywelyn responded by invading his lands, first threatening Brecon, where the burgesses offered hostages for the payment of 100 marks, then heading for Swansea where Reginald de Braose met him to offer submission and to surrender the town. He then continued westwards to threaten Haverfordwest where the burgesses offered hostages for their submission to his rule or the payment of a fine of 1,000 marks.\nTreaty of Worcester and border campaigns 1218\u20131229.\nFollowing King John's death Llywelyn concluded the Treaty of Worcester with his successor Henry III in 1218. This treaty confirmed him in possession of all his recent conquests. From then until his death Llywelyn was the dominant force in Wales, though there were further outbreaks of hostilities with marcher lords, particularly the Marshal family and Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, and sometimes with the king. Llywelyn built up marriage alliances with several of the Marcher families. One daughter, Gwladus Ddu (\"Gwladus the Dark\"), was already married to Reginald de Braose of Brecon and Abergavenny, but with Reginald an unreliable ally Llywelyn married another daughter, Marared, to John de Braose of Gower, Reginald's nephew. He found a loyal ally in Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, whose nephew and heir, John of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, married Llywelyn's daughter Elen ferch Llywelyn in about 1222. Following Reginald de Braose's death in 1228, Llywelyn also made an alliance with the powerful Roger Mortimer of Wigmore when Gwladus Ddu married as her second husband Ralph de Mortimer.\nLlywelyn was careful not to provoke unnecessary hostilities with the crown or the Marcher lords; for example, in 1220, he compelled Rhys Gryg to return four commotes in South Wales to their previous Anglo-Norman owners. He built a number of castles to defend his borders, most thought to have been built between 1220 and 1230. These were the first sophisticated stone castles in Wales; his castles at Criccieth, Deganwy, Dolbadarn, Dolwyddelan and Castell y Bere are among the best examples. Llywelyn also appears to have fostered the development of quasi-urban settlements in Gwynedd to act as centres of trade.\nHostilities broke out with William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke in 1220. Llywelyn destroyed the castles of Narberth and Wiston, burnt the town of Haverfordwest and threatened Pembroke Castle, but agreed to abandon the attack on payment of \u00a3100. In early 1223, Llywelyn crossed the border into Shropshire and captured Kinnerley and Whittington castles. The Marshals took advantage of Llywelyn's involvement here to land near St David's in April with an army raised in Ireland and recaptured Cardigan and Carmarthen without opposition. The Marshals' campaign was supported by a royal army which took possession of Montgomery. Llywelyn came to an agreement with the king at Montgomery in October that year. Llywelyn's allies in South Wales were given back lands taken from them by the Marshals and Llywelyn himself gave up his conquests in Shropshire.\nIn 1228, Llywelyn was engaged in a campaign against Hubert de Burgh, who was Justiciar of England and Ireland and one of the most powerful men in the kingdom. Hubert had been given the lordship and castle of Montgomery by the king and was encroaching on Llywelyn's lands nearby. The king raised an army to help Hubert, who began to build another castle in the commote of Ceri. However, in October the royal army was obliged to retreat and Henry agreed to destroy the half-built castle in exchange for the payment of \u00a32,000 by Llywelyn. Llywelyn raised the money by demanding the same sum as the ransom of William de Braose, Lord of Abergavenny, whom he had captured in the fighting.\nMarital problems 1230.\nFollowing his capture, William de Braose decided to ally himself to Llywelyn, and a marriage was arranged between his daughter Isabella and Llywelyn's heir, Dafydd ap Llywelyn. At Easter 1230, William visited Llywelyn's court. During this visit, he was found in Llywelyn's chamber together with Llywelyn's wife Joan. On 2 May, de Braose was hanged; Joan was placed under house arrest for a year. The \"Brut y Tywysogion\" chronicler commented: \n\"That year William de Braose the Younger, Lord of Abergavenny, was hanged by the lord Llywelyn in Gwynedd after he had been caught in Llywelyn's chamber with the king of England's daughter, Llywelyn's wife.\"\nA letter from Llywelyn to William's wife, Eva Marshal, written shortly after the execution enquires whether she still wishes the marriage between Dafydd and Isabella to take place. The marriage did go ahead, and the following year Joan was forgiven and restored to her position as princess.\nUntil 1230, Llywelyn had used the title \"princeps Norwalli\u00e6\" \"Prince of North Wales\", but from that year he changed his title to \"Prince of Aberffraw and Lord of Snowdon\". He was, however, more concerned with the reality of power rather than its appearance. He never claimed or used the title \"Prince of Wales\" despite his authority extending over other rulers in Wales.\nFinal campaigns and the Peace of Middle 1231\u20131240.\nIn 1231, there was further fighting. Llywelyn was becoming concerned about the growing power of Hubert de Burgh. Some of his men had been taken prisoner by the garrison of Montgomery and beheaded, and Llywelyn responded by burning Montgomery, Powys, New Radnor, Hay, and Brecon before turning west to capture the castles of Neath and Kidwelly. He completed the campaign by recapturing Cardigan Castle. King Henry retaliated by launching an invasion and built a new castle at Painscastle, but was unable to penetrate far into Wales.\nNegotiations continued into 1232 when Hubert was removed from office and later imprisoned. Much of his power passed to Peter de Rivaux, including control of several castles in south Wales. William Marshal had died in 1231, and his brother Richard had succeeded him as Earl of Pembroke. In 1233, hostilities broke out between Richard Marshal and Peter de Rivaux, who was supported by the king. Llywelyn made an alliance with Richard, and in January 1234 the earl and Llywelyn seized Shrewsbury. Richard was killed in Ireland in April, but the king agreed to make peace with the insurgents. The Peace of Middle, agreed on 21 June, established a truce of two years with Llywelyn, who was allowed to retain Cardigan and Builth. This truce was renewed year by year for the remainder of Llywelyn's reign.\nDeath and aftermath.\nArrangements for the succession.\nIn his later years, Llywelyn devoted much effort to ensuring that his only legitimate son, Dafydd, would follow him as ruler of Gwynedd and amended Welsh law as followed in Gwynedd. Llywelyn's amendment to Welsh law favouring legitimate children in a Church sanctioned marriage mirrored the earlier efforts of the Lord Rhys, Prince of Deheubarth, in designating Gruffydd ap Rhys II as his heir over those of his illegitimate eldest son, Maelgwn ap Rhys. In both cases, favouring legitimate children born in a Church sanctioned marriage would facilitate better relations between their sons and the wider Anglo-Norman polity and Catholic Church by removing any \"stigma\" of illegitimacy. Dafydd's older but illegitimate brother, Gruffudd, was therefore excluded as the primary heir of Llywelyn, though would be given lands to rule. This was a departure from Welsh custom, which held that the eldest son was his father's heir regardless of his parents' marital status.\nIn 1220, Llywelyn induced the minority government of King Henry to acknowledge Dafydd as his heir. In 1222, he petitioned Pope Honorius III to have Dafydd's succession confirmed. The original petition has not been preserved, but the Pope's reply refers to the \"detestable custom... in his land whereby the son of the handmaiden was equally heir with the son of the free woman and illegitimate sons obtained an inheritance as if they were legitimate.\" The Pope welcomed the fact that Llywelyn was abolishing this custom. In 1226, Llywelyn persuaded the Pope to declare his wife Joan, Dafydd's mother, to be a legitimate daughter of King John, again in order to strengthen Dafydd's position, and in 1229, the English crown accepted Dafydd's homage for the lands he would inherit from his father. In 1238, Llywelyn held a council at Strata Florida Abbey where the other Welsh princes swore fealty to Dafydd. Llywelyn's original intention had been that they should do homage to Dafydd, but the king wrote to the other rulers forbidding them to do homage. Additionally, King Llywelyn arranged for his son Dafydd to marry Isabella de Braose, eldest daughter of William de Braose. As William de Braose had no male heir, Llywelyn strategized that the vast de Braose holdings in South Wales would pass to the heir of Dafydd with Isabella.\nGruffudd was given an appanage in Meirionnydd and Ardudwy but his rule was said to be oppressive, and in 1221 Llywelyn stripped him of these territories. In 1228, Llywelyn imprisoned him, and he was not released until 1234. On his release, he was given part of Ll\u0177n to rule. His performance this time was apparently more satisfactory, and by 1238, he had been given the remainder of Ll\u0177n and a substantial part of Powys.\nDeath and the transfer of power.\nJoan died in 1237 and Llywelyn appears to have suffered a paralytic stroke the same year. From this time on, his heir Dafydd took an increasing part in the rule of the kingdom. Dafydd deprived his half-brother Gruffudd of the lands given him by Llywelyn and later seized him and his eldest son Owain and held them in Criccieth Castle. The chronicler of \"Brut y Tywysogion\" records that in 1240, \"the lord Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, Prince of Wales, son of Owain Gwynedd, a second Achilles, died having taken on the habit of religion at Aberconwy, and was buried honourably.\"\nLlywelyn died at the Cistercians abbey of Aberconwy, which he had founded and was buried there. This abbey was later moved to Maenan, becoming the Maenan Abbey, near Llanrwst, and Llywelyn's stone coffin can now be seen in St Grwst's Church, Llanrwst. Among the poets who lamented his passing was Einion Wan:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;True lord of the land \u2013 how strange that today&lt;br&gt;He rules not o'er Gwynedd;&lt;br&gt;Lord of nought but the piled up stones of his tomb,&lt;br&gt;Of the seven-foot grave in which he lies.\nDafydd succeeded Llywelyn as Prince of Gwynedd, but King Henry was not prepared to allow him to inherit his father's position in the remainder of Wales. Dafydd was forced to agree to a treaty greatly restricting his power and was also obliged to hand his half-brother Gruffudd over to the king, who now had the option of using him against Dafydd. Gruffudd was killed attempting to escape from the Tower of London in 1244. This left the field clear for Dafydd, but Dafydd himself died with illegitimate and underage issue in 1246 and was eventually succeeded by his nephew, Gruffudd's son, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd.\nHistorical assessment.\nLlywelyn dominated Wales for more than 40 years and was one of only two Welsh rulers to be called \"the Great\", the other being his ancestor Rhodri the Great (Rhodri Mawr). The first person to give Llywelyn the title \"the Great\" seems to have been his near contemporary, the English chronicler Matthew Paris.\nJohn Edward Lloyd gave the following assessment of Llywelyn:\n\"Among the chieftains who battled against the Anglo-Norman power his place will always be high if not indeed the highest of all, for no man ever made better or more judicious use of the native force of the Welsh people for adequate national ends; his patriotic statesmanship will always entitle him to wear the proud style of Llywelyn the Great\".\nDavid Moore gives a different view:\n\"When Llywelyn died in 1240, his \"principatus\" of Wales rested on shaky foundations. Although he had dominated Wales, exacted unprecedented submissions and raised the status of the Prince of Gwynedd to new heights, his three major ambitions \u2013 a permanent hegemony, its recognition by the king, and its inheritance in its entirety by his heir \u2013 remained unfulfilled. His supremacy, like that of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, had been merely personal in nature, and there was no institutional framework to maintain it either during his lifetime or after his death.\"\nChildren.\nLlywelyn married Joan, natural daughter of John, King of England, in 1205. Llywelyn and Joan had three identified children in the records, but in all probability had more, as Llywelyn's children were fully recognized during his marriage to Joan whilst his father-in-law, King John, was alive. Little is known of Llywelyn's mistress, Tangwystl Goch. His union with her was not recognised by the church. She was the daughter of Llywarch \"Goch.\" After Joan's death, Llywelyn took Eva the daughter of Fulk FitzWarin as his wife. As well as children from his marriage to Joan, he also had children out of wedlock to a Welsh concubine. The following are recorded in contemporary or near-contemporary records:\nChildren by Joan:\nChildren by Tangwystl Goch, (died c. 1198):\nChildren whose parentage is uncertain:\nFamily tree.\nThe family tree of Llywelyn the Great's lineal descendants from his birth in the late 12th century until the end of the family dynasty of Gwynedd in the late 14th century:\nCultural allusions.\nA number of Welsh poems addressed to Llywelyn by contemporary poets such as Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr, Dafydd Benfras and Llywarch ap Llywelyn (better known under the nickname \"Prydydd y Moch\") have survived. Very little of this poetry has been published in English translation.\nLlywelyn has continued to figure in modern Welsh literature. The play Siwan (1956, English translation 1960) by Saunders Lewis deals with the finding of William de Braose in Joan's chamber and his execution by Llywelyn. Another well-known Welsh play about Llywelyn is \"Llywelyn Fawr\" by Thomas Parry.\nLlywelyn is the main character or one of the main characters in several English-language novels:\nThe story of the faithful hound Gelert, owned by Llywelyn and mistakenly killed by him, is also considered to be fiction. \"Gelert's grave\" is a popular tourist attraction in Beddgelert but is thought to have been created by an 18th-century innkeeper to boost the tourist trade. The tale itself is a variation on a common folktale motif.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The institution was established in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie as the Carnegie Technical Schools. In 1912, it became the Carnegie Institute of Technology and began granting four-year degrees. In 1967, it became Carnegie Mellon University through its merger with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, founded in 1913 by Andrew Mellon and Richard B. Mellon and formerly a part of the University of Pittsburgh.\nThe university consists of seven colleges, including the College of Engineering, the School of Computer Science, the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the Tepper School of Business. The university has its main campus located from downtown Pittsburgh. It also has over a dozen degree-granting locations on six continents, including campuses in Qatar, Silicon Valley, and Kigali, Rwanda (Carnegie Mellon University Africa) and partnerships with universities nationally and globally. Carnegie Mellon enrolls 15,818 students across its multiple campuses from 117 countries and employs more than 1,400 faculty members. Carnegie Mellon is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\".\nCarnegie Mellon competes in NCAA Division III athletics as a founding member of the University Athletic Association. Carnegie Mellon fields eight men's teams and nine women's teams as the Tartans. The university's faculty and alumni include 21 Nobel Prize laureates and 13 Turing Award winners and have received 142 Emmy Awards, 64 Tony Awards, and 13 Academy Awards.\nHistory.\nThe Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by the Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who wrote \"My heart is in the work\", when he donated the funds to create the institution. Carnegie's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers, many of whom worked in his mills. Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887. In 1912, the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) and began offering four-year degrees. During this time, CIT consisted of four constituent schools: the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the School of Apprentices and Journeymen, the School of Science and Technology, and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women.\nThe Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon (who went on to become U.S. Treasury Secretary) and Richard B. Mellon in honor of their father, Thomas Mellon, patriarch of the Mellon family. The Institute began as a research organization that performed contract work for government and industry, initially as a department within the University of Pittsburgh. In 1927, the Mellon Institute was incorporated as an independent nonprofit. In 1937, the Mellon Institute's iconic building was completed on Fifth Avenue.\nIn 1967, with support from Paul Mellon, the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University. In 1973, Carnegie Mellon's coordinate women's college, the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, merged its academic programs with the rest of the university. The industrial research mission of the Mellon Institute survived the merger as the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI) and continued doing work on contract to industry and government. In 2001, CMRI's programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the tenure of president Richard Cyert (1972\u20131990) witnessed a period of growth and development. The research budget grew from roughly $12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than $110 million in the late 1980s. Researchers in new fields like robotics and software engineering helped the university to build its reputation. One example was the introduction of the \"Andrew\" computing network in the mid-1980s. This project linking all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a technology leader in education and research. On April 24, 1985, \"cmu.edu\", Carnegie Mellon's Internet domain, became one of the first six .edu domain names.\nIn the 1990s and into the 2000s, Carnegie Mellon solidified its status among American universities, consistently ranking in the top 25 in the national \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" rankings, and in the top 30 (ranking 28th in 2022) amongst universities worldwide. Carnegie Mellon is distinct in its interdisciplinary approach to research and education. Through the establishment of programs and centers outside the limitations of departments or colleges, the university has established leadership in fields such as computational finance, information systems, cognitive sciences, management, arts management, product design, behavioral economics, energy science and economics, human\u2013computer interaction, entertainment technology, and decision science.\nOn April 15, 1997, Jared L. Cohon, former dean of the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies, was elected president by Carnegie Mellon's board of trustees. During Cohon's presidency, Carnegie Mellon continued its trajectory of innovation and growth. His strategic plan aimed to leverage the university's strengths to benefit society in the areas of biotechnology and life sciences, information and security technology, environmental science and practices, the fine arts and humanities, and business and public policy. In 2006, following negotiations between President Cohon and South Australian Premier Mike Rann, CMU opened a campus of the Heinz College in the historic Torrens Building in Adelaide, Australia. President Cohon's term ended on June 30, 2013, after which he returned to the faculty at Carnegie Mellon.\nOn July 1, 2003, Carnegie Mellon launched \"Insp!re Innovation\", a $1 billion comprehensive fundraising campaign. Half of the campaign goal is intended for the endowment to provide long-lasting support for faculty, students and breakthrough innovations. The campaign brought in a total of $1.19 billion, with $578.5 million going toward Carnegie Mellon's endowment. It also enabled the university to establish 31 endowed professorships, 97 endowed fellowships and 250 endowed scholarships.\nOn September 7, 2011, William S. Dietrich II, the former chairman of Dietrich Industries, Inc., a subsidiary of Worthington Industries, Inc., pledged a gift of $265 million, effective on October 6, 2011, upon his death. In response to this gift, Carnegie Mellon renamed the College of Humanities and Social Sciences as the Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences after William Dietrich's mother.\nOn April 23, 2012, New York's Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and New York University's President John Sexton announced an agreement between New York City, New York's MTA, and a consortium of academic institutions, and private technology companies that led to the creation in New York of a Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), an applied science research institute composed of a partnership of institutions from around the globe, led by New York University with a consortium of universities including Carnegie Mellon, the University of Warwick, the City University of New York, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, and the University of Toronto.\nOn February 5, 2013, Carnegie Mellon announced the selection of Subra Suresh, Director of the National Science Foundation and Dean of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Engineering, as its ninth president effective July 1, 2013. Suresh stepped down in June 2017 and was replaced by Farnam Jahanian, the university's interim-president and former provost, in March 2018.\nOn October 30, 2019, Carnegie Mellon publicly announced the launch of \"Make Possible: The Campaign for Carnegie Mellon University\", a campaign which seeks to raise $2 billion to advance the university's priorities, including campus development.\nOn September 8, 2022, Carnegie Mellon announced a $275.7 million partnership with the Mastercard Foundation to support Carnegie Mellon University Africa in Kigali, Rwanda. Carnegie Mellon's Kigali campus provides graduate-level study in engineering and artificial intelligence.\nOn November 6, 2023, Carnegie Mellon Trustee Ray Lane and his wife Stephanie Lane invested $25 million in support of the university's Computational Biology department, which was renamed the Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department in their honor.\nCampus.\nOverview.\nCarnegie Mellon's 157.2 acre (63\u00a0ha) main campus is five miles (8\u00a0km) from downtown Pittsburgh, between Schenley Park and the neighborhoods of Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, and Oakland. Carnegie Mellon is bordered to the west by the campus of the University of Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellon owns 81 buildings in the Oakland and Squirrel Hill neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.\nFor decades, the center of student life on campus was Skibo Hall, the university's student union. Built in the 1950s, Skibo Hall's design was typical of mid-century modern architecture but was poorly equipped to deal with advances in computer and internet connectivity. The original Skibo Hall was razed in the summer of 1994 and replaced by a new student union that is fully Wi-Fi enabled. Known as the University Center, the building was dedicated in 1996. In 2014, Carnegie Mellon re-dedicated the University Center as the Cohon University Center in recognition of the eighth president of the university, Jared Cohon.\nA large grassy area known as \"The Cut\" forms the backbone of the campus, with a separate grassy area known as \"The Mall\" running perpendicular. The Cut was formed by filling in a ravine (hence the name) with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the College of Fine Arts building.\nThe northwestern part of the campus (home to Hamburg Hall, Newell-Simon Hall, Smith Hall, and Gates Hillman Complex) was acquired from the United States Bureau of Mines in the 1980s.\nCarnegie Mellon has been purchasing 100% renewable energy for its electricity since 2011.\nEarly architecture.\nThe campus began to take shape in the Beaux-Arts architecture style of George Carnegie Palmer and Henry Hornbostel of Palmer &amp; Hornbostel, winners of the 1904 competition to design the original institution and later the founder of the Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture. Most buildings around the university's main campus were originally roofed with green Ludowici Spanish tile.\nThere was little change to the campus between the first and second World War. A 1938 master plan by Githens and Keally suggested acquisition of new land along Forbes Avenue, but the plan was not fully implemented. The period starting with the construction of the Hall of the Arts building (former home of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration) in 1952 and ending with Wean Hall in 1971 saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University. Around this time an expanding student population demanded improved facilities for student life, athletics and libraries. The campus expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land along Schenley Park.\nMid-20th century.\nThe buildings of this era reflected contemporary architectural styles. The International Style, with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, had been in vogue in European settings since the 1930s. It came late to the Carnegie Mellon campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among American universities to abandon historical styles. By the 1960s, the International Style was adopted to accomplish needed expansion quickly and affordably with the swelling of student ranks in the aftermath of the GI Bill in 1944. Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but not in its form or materials.\nStarting in the 1990s the university built a new university center (Cohon University Center), theater and drama building (Purnell Center for the Arts), business school building (Tepper School of Business), and several dormitories.\n2000s.\nBaker Hall was renovated in the early 2000s, and new chemistry labs were established in Doherty Hall soon after. Several computer science buildings, such as Newell-Simon Hall, also were established, renovated or renamed in the early 2000s.\nIn 2006, Carnegie Mellon Trustee Jill Gansman Kraus donated the -tall sculpture \"Walking to the Sky\", which was placed on the lawn facing Forbes Avenue between the Cohon University Center and Warner Hall. The sculpture was controversial for its placement, the general lack of input from the campus community, and its (lack of) aesthetic appeal.\nThe Gates Hillman Complex opened for occupancy on August 7, 2009. It sits on a site on the university's West Campus, surrounded by Cyert Hall, the Purnell Center for the Arts, Doherty Hall, Newell-Simon Hall, Smith Hall, Hamburg Hall, and the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center. It contains 318 offices as well as labs, computer clusters, lecture halls, classrooms and a 255-seat auditorium. The Gates Hillman Complex was made possible by a $20 million lead gift from the Gates Foundation and an additional $10 million grant from the Henry L. Hillman Foundation. The Gates Hillman Complex and the Purnell Center for the Arts are connected by the Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge.\nIn September 2012, Carnegie Mellon announced the construction of the Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall on the Pittsburgh campus. The building is situated between Hamerschlag Hall, Roberts Hall, and Wean Hall and houses the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, Bertucci Nanotechnology Lab, Engineering Research Accelerator (formerly known as the Institute for Complex Engineered Systems), Disruptive Health Technologies Institute, and the Department of Biomedical Engineering. In November 2013, Carnegie Mellon announced a $67 million gift from David Tepper, who previously donated $56 million, to develop the Tepper Quadrangle on the north campus.

Options for upperclassmen include Fifth &amp; Clyde, Morewood Gardens, West Wing, Doherty, Fairfax, Margaret Morrison, Fifth Neville, Shady Oak, Shirley, Forbes &amp; Beeler, and Woodlawn Apartments as well as Henderson, Resnik, Roselawn, Spirit, Tech, Webster, and Welch Houses.\nFraternities and sororities.\nThe Greek tradition at Carnegie Mellon began over 100 years ago with the founding of the first fraternity on campus, Theta Xi, in 1912.\nSpecialized communities.\nIn 2022, Welch House began to host the specialized Queer community, a living community suited to the needs of non-binary students by allowing students to \"live in the same room with any other student inclusive of sex assigned at birth, gender identity, gender expression, and/or sexual orientation\". Welch House consists of semi-suite singles and doubles. In addition, Stever House hosts an all-gender floor for students who would prefer a traditional double.\nSpirit House is a residential community for upperclassmen designated for members of the SPIRIT student organization, a Black Student Union that serves as a haven for Black students within the Carnegie Mellon community and champions issues facing the Black community.\nTraditions.\nIn the early days of Carnegie Tech, there was a single bridge connecting Margaret Morrison Women's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology. The bridge was a meeting place for students. In 1916, the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area. The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place. The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence. The administration was about to give up and tear it down, but that night a fraternity, as a prank, painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party. Ever since, painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition. The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as \"the Cut\". Students guard the fence 24 hours a day, and, as long as two vigils are maintained, no other student may \"take\" the fence. The fence can then be painted by the group that has it, but only between midnight and 6 am. Only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine. The previous paint cannot be stripped, and each new painting adds a new layer. The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1' of surrounding paint, and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete. Today the fence is considered \"the world's most painted object\" by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\".\nAthletics.\nThe Carnegie Mellon Tartans were a founding member of the University Athletic Association of NCAA Division III. Prior to World War II, Carnegie Mellon (as Carnegie Tech) played with what are now classified as NCAA Division I teams. In 1936, the Carnegie Tech riflery team won the national intercollegiate championship. The Carnegie Tech men's basketball team was a member of the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference throughout the conference's existence from 1932 to 1939 and won the conference championship in 1936, defeating Pittsburgh in a conference championship playoff game.\nVarsity teams are fielded in basketball, track, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming and diving, volleyball, tennis, and softball. In addition, club teams exist in ultimate frisbee, rowing, rugby, lacrosse, hockey, baseball, softball, skiing &amp; snowboarding, soccer, volleyball, water polo, and cycling. Carnegie Mellon Athletics runs a comprehensive and popular intramural system, maintains facilities (primarily Skibo Gymnasium, Cohon University Center, Gesling Stadium, and the future Highmark Center for Health, Wellness and Athletics), and offers courses to students in fitness and sports. Carnegie Mellon's primary athletic rivals are fellow UAA schools Case Western Reserve University and Washington University in St. Louis; the Tartans had an especially intense rivalry with the latter's football team from the 2000s to 2017.\nFootball.\nOn November 28, 1926, the 6\u20132 Carnegie Technical Institute football team shut out the undefeated Notre Dame Fighting Irish 19\u20130 at Forbes Field. Knute Rockne, the coach of the Irish at the time, was so confident that the Irish would defeat \"tiny Carnegie Tech\" that he decided to skip the game and travel to Chicago to watch the Army-Navy football game for scouting purposes. It was only later that he found out by telegram that the Irish had suffered their first loss of the season. ESPN compared the upset to the Appalachian State victory over the University of Michigan in 2007. The game was ranked the fourth-greatest upset in college football history by ESPN.\nSince 2025, the Tartans play in the Centennial Conference at the NCAA Division III level. The head coach of the football team is Ryan Larsen, who was the Presidents' Athletic Conference coach of the year in 2022. Prior to losing in the Sweet 16 of the 2022 D3 playoffs, the Tartans held a 17-game win streak which was, at the time, the longest win streak across all NCAA divisions in football.\nTrack and cross country.\nIn recent years, the varsity track and cross country programs have seen outstanding success on the Division III national level. The men's cross country team has finished in the top 15 in the nation each of the last three years, and has boasted several individual All-Americans. The men's track team has also boasted several individual All-Americans spanning sprinting, distance, and field disciplines. Recent All-Americans from the track team are Bram Miller (2021), Tommy Vandenberg (2014\u20132015), Brian Harvey (2007\u20132009), Davey Quinn (2007), Nik Bonaddio (2004, 2005), Mark Davis (2004, 2005), Russel Verbofsky (2004, 2005) and Kiley Williams.

{"id": "48097", "revid": "45451381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48097", "title": "Bitch (slang)", "text": "Pejorative slang word for a person or thing, mainly a woman\nIn the English language, bitch () as a slang term is a pejorative for a person, usually a woman. When applied to a woman or girl, it means someone who is belligerent, unreasonable, malicious, controlling, aggressive, or dominant. When applied to a man or boy, \"bitch\" reverses its meaning and is a derogatory term for being subordinate, weak, or cowardly. In gay speech the word \"bitch\" can refer approvingly to a man who is unusually assertive or has the characteristics used pejoratively of a woman.\nThe term \"bitch\" is one of the most common profanities in the English language. It has been used as a \"term of contempt towards women\" for \"over six centuries\", and considered by some to be a slur that fosters sexism against women. It has been characterized as \"an archaic word demeaning women since as early as the 15th century\" that seeks to control women. The word is considered taboo in mainstream media, and euphemisms such as \"the B-word\" are sometimes used to minimize its negative impact.\nThe term \"bitch\" literally means a female dog. Its original use as a vulgarism carried a meaning suggesting high sexual desire in a woman, comparable to a dog in heat. The range of meanings has expanded in modern usage (such as when applied to a man). In a feminist context, it can indicate a strong or assertive woman and has therefore been reappropriated by some women.\nHistory.\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the term \"bitch\" comes from the Old English word \"bicce\" or \"bicge\", meaning \"female dog\", which dates to around 1000 CE. It may have derived from the earlier Old Norse word \"bikkja\", also meaning \"female dog\".\n\"Dog\" has long been used as an insult toward both women and men. In ancient Greece, dog was often used in a derogatory sense to refer to someone whose behavior was improper or transgressive. This could include shamelessness or lack of restraint, lack of hospitality, lack of loyalty, and indiscriminate or excessive violence, among other qualities. Over time, classicist C. Franco argues, a \"persistent symbolic connection\" developed between dogs and women in Greek literature that expressed and reinforced women's subordinate position in society and their supposedly inferior nature.\nThere may also be a connection between less literal senses of \"bitch\" and the Greek goddess Artemis. As she is the goddess of the hunt, she was often portrayed with a pack of hunting dogs and sometimes transformed into an animal herself. She was seen as free, vigorous, cold, impetuous, unsympathetic, wild, and beautiful.\nThe earliest use of \"bitch\" specifically as a derogatory term for women dates to the 15th century. Its earliest slang meaning mainly referred to sexual behavior, according to the English language historian Geoffrey Hughes:\nThe early applications were to a promiscuous or sensual woman, a metaphorical extension of the behavior of a bitch in heat. Herein lies the original point of the powerful insult \"son of a bitch,\" found as \"biche sone\" ca. 1330 in \"Arthur and Merlin\" ... while in a spirited exchange in the \"Chester Play\" (ca. 1400) a character demands: \"Whom callest thou queine, skabde bitch?\" (\"Who are you calling a whore, you miserable bitch?\").\n\"Bitch\" remained a strong insult through the nineteenth century. The entry in Francis Grose's \"Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue\" (1785) reads:\nA she dog, or doggess; the most offensive appellation\nthat can be given to an English woman, even more\nprovoking than that of whore, as may be gathered from the\nregular Billinsgate or St Giles answer\u2014\"I may be a\nwhore, but can't be a bitch.\"\nThroughout the word's evolution into the nineteenth century, it became gradually less offensive. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in the nineteenth century described the insult as \"strictly a lewd or sensual woman\". The word went through many similar phases throughout history. It was not until the 20th century that feminism began to reevaluate the term and its appropriation.\nIn the 1920s, \"bitch\" became once again a common insult used against women. The term \"bitch\" became more popular in common language during this era. Between 1915 and 1930, the use of \"bitch\" in newspapers and literature more than doubled. The writing of Ernest Hemingway popularized the more modern meaning of \"bitch\" in this era. He used it to represent favorable qualities such as ferocity, edginess, and grit. It was during this time that women began gaining more freedom (such as the right to vote through the Nineteenth Amendment). The word \"bitch\" during the twenties meant \"malicious or consciously attempting to harm\", \"difficult, annoying, or interfering\", and \"sexually brazen or overly vulgar\".\nAccording to Dr. Timothy Jay, there are \"over 70 different taboo words\", but 80 percent of the time only ten words are used, and \"bitch\" is included in that set. Being called the term \"bitch\" has been associated with worsening the mental health of women.\nModern use.\nIn modern usage, the slang term bitch has different meanings depending largely on social context and may vary from very offensive to endearing, and as with many slang terms, its meaning and nuances can vary depending on the region in which it is used.\nThe term \"bitch\" can refer to a person or thing that is very difficult, as in \"Life's a bitch\" or \"He sure got the bitch end of that deal\". It is common for insults to lose intensity as their meaning broadens (\"bastard\" is another example). In the film \"The Women\" (1939), Joan Crawford could only allude to the word: \"And by the way, there's a name for you ladies, but it isn't used in high society\u2014outside of a kennel.\" At the time, use of the actual word would have been censored by the Hays Office. By 1974, Elton John had a hit single (#4 in the U.S. and #14 in the U.K.) with \"The Bitch Is Back\", in which he says \"bitch\" repeatedly. It was, however, censored by some radio stations. On late night U.S. television, the character Emily Litella (1976\u20131978) on \"Saturday Night Live\" (portrayed by Gilda Radner) would frequently refer to Jane Curtin under her breath at the end of their \"Weekend Update\" routine in this way: \"Oh! Never mind...! \"Bitch!\"\"\n\"Bitchin' \" arose in the 1950s to describe something found to be desirable or exciting.\nModern use can include self-description, often as an unfairly difficult person. For example, in \"The Bitch in the House\" by Cathi Hanauer, a woman describes her marriage: \"I'm fine all day at work, but as soon as I get home, I'm a horror...I'm the bitch in the house.\" Boy George admitted \"I was being a bitch\" in a falling out with Elton John.\nGenerally, the term \"bitch\" is still considered offensive, and not accepted in formal situations. According to linguist Deborah Tannen, \"\"Bitch\" is the most contemptible thing you can say about a woman. Save perhaps the four-letter C word.\" It's common for the word to be censored on prime time TV, often rendered as \"the b-word\". During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, a John McCain supporter referred to Hillary Clinton by asking, \"How do we beat the bitch?\" The event was reported in censored format:\nOn CNN's \"The Situation Room,\" Washington Post media critic and CNN \"Reliable Sources\" host Howard Kurtz observed that \"Senator McCain did not embrace the 'b' word that this woman in the audience used.\" ABC reporter Kate Snow adopted the same locution. On CNN's \"Out in the Open,\" Rick Sanchez characterized the word without using it by saying, \"Last night, we showed you a clip of one of his supporters calling Hillary Clinton the b-word that rhymes with witch.\" A local Fox 25 news reporter made the same move when he rhymed the unspoken word with rich.\nA study reported that, when used on social media, \"bitch\" \"aims to promote traditional, cultural beliefs about femininity\". Used hundreds of thousands of times per day on such platforms, it is associated with sexist harassment, \"victimizing targets\", and \"shaming\" victims who do not abide by degrading notions about femininity.\nReappropriation.\nIn the context of modern feminism, \"bitch\" has varied reappropriated meanings that may connote a \"strong female\" (anti-stereotype of weak submissive woman), \"cunning\" (equal to males in mental guile), or else it may be used as a tongue-in cheek backhanded compliment for someone who has excelled in an achievement. For example, \"Bitch\" magazine describes itself as a \"feminist response to pop culture\".\nFeminist attorney Jo Freeman (Joreen) authored \"The BITCH Manifesto\" in 1968:\nA Bitch takes shit from no one. You may not like her, but you cannot ignore her. ... [Bitches] have loud voices and often use them. Bitches are not pretty. ... Bitches seek their identity strictly thru themselves and what they do. They are subjects, not objects. ... Often they do dominate other people when roles are not available to them which more creatively sublimate their energies and utilize their capabilities. More often they are accused of domineering when doing what would be considered natural by a man.\nBitch has also been reappropriated by hip-hop culture, rappers use the adjective \"bad bitch\" to refer to an independent, confident, attractive woman. The term is used in a complimentary way, meaning the woman is desirable. One of the first instances of \"bitch\" being used in this way is in the song \"Da Baddest Bitch\" by Trina, released in 1999. This can also be seen throughout multiple different songs from Rihanna's song entitled \"Bad Bitch\" featuring Beyonc\u00e9 which reiterates the line \"I'm a bad bitch\" multiple times. \"BitchSlut\" by Anna Wise prominently uses the words \"bitch\" and \"slut\" to reclaim identity. This use of the word bitch shows women reappropriating the meaning to be a more positive and empowering word for women.\nThe increased usage of the word \"bitch\" casually or in a friendly way by women has been characterized by Sherryl Kleynman as a result of the absorption of sexist culture by women. Such usage has been cited by Kleinman et al. as increasing the perception the word is acceptable and excusing men who use it against women.\nPop culture.\nIn pop culture, the use of the term \"bitch\" has increased through media such as television, movies, magazines, social media, etc. The use of the word \"bitch\" on television shows tripled between 1998 and 2007, which had much to do with the word's feminist facelift in the previous decade.\nIn a 2006 interview titled \"Pop Goes the Feminist\", \"Bitch\" magazine co-founder Andi Zeisler explained the naming of the magazine:\nWhen we chose the name, we were thinking, well, it would be great to reclaim the word \"bitch\" for strong, outspoken women, much the same way that \"queer\" has been reclaimed by the gay community. That was very much on our minds, the positive power of language reclamation.\nPop culture contains a number of slogans of self-identification based on \"bitch\". For example,\nThere are several backronyms. Heartless Bitches International is a club with the slogan \"Because we know BITCH means: Being In Total Control, Honey!\" Other imagined acronyms include\nAs stated in Scallen's \"https://\", \"As Asim demonstrates with his discussion of the appropriation of the N word by black communities, the term \"bitch\" is deployed in pop culture in multiple ways (with multiple meanings) at the same time.\" Derogatory terms are constantly appropriated. Many women, such as Nicki Minaj, refer to themselves as bitches. By calling oneself a bitch in today's culture, these women are referencing their success, money, sexuality, and power. Asha Layne's article http:// , \"The change in the meaning of the word thus subverts the tools of oppression used to dominate women to now empower them.\"\nHip hop culture.\nSome early uses of the word in hip-hop music include Duke Bootee's classic 1983 song with Grandmaster Flash, \"'New York New York\",' and Slick Rick's 'La Di Da Di' (1985), marked the emergence of 'bitch' in hip-hop lyrics. Since then, artists and followers of the culture have frequently used the term, with variations like 'bee-otch' popularized by Oakland-based rapper Too $hort in the late 1980s.\nReaching back to the dozens and dirty blues, early rappers like Slick Rick established the bitch as a character: a woman, often treacherous, but sometimes simply d\u00e9class\u00e9. N.W.A.'s song 'One Less Bitch' exemplifies misogynistic attitudes, equating women with negative stereotypes such as 'money hungry scandalous groupies.' These lyrics highlight the ongoing tensions within hip-hop culture regarding gender representation and language usage. While some misogynistic rap perpetuates harmful stereotypes of women as 'money-hungry, scandalous, manipulating, and demanding, 'as stated by Adams and Fuller (2006), the word has also been directed towards men, often to denote subordination or perceived inferiority toward \"unmanly\" or homosexual men. An example of this is the song \"Bitches 2\" by Ice-T, which gives an example of a male \"bitch\" in each verse.\nHowever, amidst the prevalence of derogatory usage, female hip-hop artists have challenged the word's appropriation by male rappers. Queen Latifah's 1993 track 'U.N.I.T.Y.' confronts this misogyny, demanding, \"Who you callin' a bitch?\" Similarly, Roxanne Shante and MC Lyte reclaimed the term, with Shante even releasing an album entitled \"'The Bitch Is Back\"' in 1992. Popular culture has inspired women to redefine the word bitch as a euphemism for \"Strong black woman\". A modern example would be Megan Thee Stallion's track 'B.I.T.C.H.' which exemplifies this; flipping the script to portray 'bitch' as a descriptor of self-respect and autonomy.\nIn 2016, Kanye West released his seventh studio album called \"The Life of Pablo\". On the song called \"Famous\" West raps, \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.\" This sparked a controversy with Taylor Swift as she \"cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message.\" These lyrics highlight the ongoing tensions within hip-hop culture regarding gender. In response to Swift's remarks, West went on Twitter and posted a tweet which said how the word \"bitch\" is an endearing term in hip hop like the word \"nigga\".\nIn reference to men.\nWhen used to describe a male, \"bitch\" may also confer the meaning of subordinate, especially to another male, as in prison. Generally, this term is used to indicate that the person is acting outside the confines of their gender roles, such as when women are assertive or aggressive, or when men are passive or servile. According to James Coyne from the Department of Psychology at the University of California, \"'Bitch' serves the social function of isolating and discrediting a class of people who do not conform to the socially accepted patterns of behavior.\"\nIdioms.\nSon of a bitch.\nThe first known appearance of \"son-of-a-bitch\" in a work of American fiction is \"Seventy-Six\" (1823), a historical fiction novel set during the American Revolutionary War by eccentric writer and critic John Neal. The protagonist, Jonathan Oadley, recounts a battle scene in which he is mounted on a horse: \"I wheeled, made a dead set at the son-of-a-bitch in my rear, unhorsed him, and actually broke through the line.\"\nThe term's use as an insult is as old as that of \"bitch\". Euphemistic terms are often substituted, such as \"gun\" in the phrase \"son of a gun\" as opposed to \"son of a bitch\", or \"s.o.b.\" for the same phrase. Like \"bitch\", the severity of the insult has diminished. Roy Blount Jr. in 2008 extolled the virtues of \"son of a bitch\" (particularly in comparison to \"asshole\") in common speech and deed. \"Son of a bitch\" can also be used as a \"how about that\" reaction, or as a reaction to excruciating pain.\nIn politics the phrase \"Yes, he is a son of a bitch, but he is \"our\" son of a bitch\" has been attributed, probably apocryphally, to various U.S. presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard Nixon. Immediately after the detonation of the first atomic bomb in Alamogordo, New Mexico, in July 1945 (the device codenamed Gadget), the Manhattan Project scientist who served as the director of the test, Kenneth Tompkins Bainbridge, exclaimed to Robert Oppenheimer \"Now we're all sons-of-bitches.\"\nIn January 2022, U.S. president Joe Biden was recorded on a hot mic responding to Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asking, \"Do you think inflation is a political liability ahead of the midterms?\" Biden responded sarcastically, saying, \"It's a great asset\u2014more inflation. What a stupid son of a bitch.\"\nThe 19th-century British racehorse Filho da Puta took its name from \"Son of a Bitch\" in Portuguese.\nThe Curtiss SB2C, a World War II U.S. Navy dive bomber, was called \"Son-of-a-Bitch 2nd Class\" by some of its pilots and crewmen.\nIn cards.\nTo have the \"bitch end\" of a hand in poker is to have the weaker version of the same hand as another player. This situation occurs especially in poker games with community cards. For example, to have a lower straight than one's opponent is to have the bitch end.\n\"The bitch\" is slang for the queen of spades.\nOther forms.\nWhen used as a verb, to bitch means to complain. Usage in this context is almost always pejorative in intent.\nAs an adjective, the term sometimes has a meaning opposite its usual connotations. Something that is bitching (\"the\" bitch) is really great. For example, an admired motorcycle may be praised as a \"bitchin' bike\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Visby is also the episcopal see for the Diocese of Visby. The Hanseatic city of Visby is one of the best-preserved medieval cities in Scandinavia, and, since 1995, it has been on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. Among the most notable historical remains are the long town wall that encircles the town center, and a number of church ruins and its small decorative alleyways. The decline as a Hanseatic city in the Late Middle Ages was the cause for many stone houses being preserved in their original medieval style.\nVisby is a popular vacation destination for Scandinavians during the summer and receives thousands of tourists every year. It is by far the most populous Swedish locality outside the Swedish mainland. The Gotland University is in Visby, and since 1July 2013, it is a department of Uppsala University under the name Uppsala University\u2013Campus Gotland. Visby is also the sole county seat in Sweden accessible from the mainland only by boat and air.\nImportant annual events held in Visby include the annual political forum Almedalen Week.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Visby\" comes from the Old Norse \"Vis\", (genitive singular of \"Vi\") meaning \"(pagan) place of sacrifices\", and \"by\", meaning \"village\". In the Gutasagan (mid 14th century) the place is referred to as just \"Wi\" meaning \"holy place, place of worship\".\nVisby is sometimes called \"The City of Roses\" or \"The City of Ruins\".\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical affiliations\n 1361\u2013?\n Kalmar Union 1397\u2013?\n Sweden 1645\u2013?\n Russian Empire 1808\n Sweden 1808\u20131814\n Sweden\u2013Norway 1814\u20131905\n Sweden 1905\u2013present\nThe earliest history of Visby is uncertain, but it is known to have been a centre of merchandise around AD 900. It was inhabited as early as the Stone Age, probably because of the access to fresh water and a natural harbour. The oldest finds at the site of present-day Visby are what have been interpreted as \"beach huts\", with the radiocarbon dating method to the 7th\u20139th centuries AD.\nIn the 12th century, Visby Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Mary, was constructed. It was reshaped in the 13th century to its current appearance, and was officially opened in 1225, by the bishop of the Swedish city of Link\u00f6ping (\"in regional map\"). Several other churches were also constructed in the ensuing centuries. The city flourished, thanks to the German Hanseatic League.\nThe work on the ring wall was likely begun in the 12th century. Around 1300, it was rebuilt to reach its current height, acquiring the characteristic towers, although some towers were not constructed until the 15th century. The ringwall is still largely intact.\nIn the first half of the 14th century (1300\u20131350), Visby was at the height of its wealth and influence, and it was during this time that Laws of Wisbuy, a set of maritime laws that had broad influence in the Baltic and beyond, were probably promulgated.\nIn 1361, Gotland was conquered by Valdemar IV of Denmark. 1,800 Gotlanders were killed in battle in front of the city. Valdemar tore down part of the wall, set up three huge beer barrels and threatened to turn his men loose to pillage the town unless they were filled with silver and gold. The Visby city fathers fulfilled the demand, with churches stripped of their valuables. Valdemar added \"King of Gotland\" to his title list. His treatment of Visby, a member of the Hanseatic League, precipitated that League into war with Denmark; however, though Valdemar was forced into various concessions, he retained Visby as a Danish city.\nIn 1391, 1394 and 1398, it was taken and plundered by the Victual Brothers, pirates who sailed the Baltic Sea. An invading army of Teutonic Knights conquered Gotland in 1398, destroyed Visby and expelled the Victual Brothers. In 1409, Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen of the Teutonic Knights guaranteed peace with the Kalmar Union of Scandinavia by selling the island of Gotland to Queen Margaret of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.\nIn 1411, the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish King Eric of Pomerania had the castle of Visborg constructed, and settled himself there for 12 years, during which the city virtually became a pirates' nest, and the commerce halted. As of 1470, the Hanseatic League rescinded Visby's status as a Hanseatic town.\nIn 1525, the final blow came. In the Danish throne quarrel, L\u00fcbeck, a Free City of the Holy Roman Empire and a leading member of the Hanseatic League, supported Frederick I, while S\u00f8ren Norby the Danish governor of Gotland fought for Christian II, even after Christian's official resignation in 1523. While Norby fought a military action in Sweden, the L\u00fcbeckers successfully attacked Visby and set the city on fire from four sites. But unlike widespread belief, several churches survived at first. The churches of St. James (which already had been closed before), St. Nicholas and St. Gertrude were sacked by L\u00fcbeck's army. With the reformation, all churches except St. John, which became the city parish, were closed. In 1528, the citizens of Visby sacked the church of the Holy Trinity, or the church of Our Lord () in revenge for the plundering of their town. In 1533\u201334, the new Danish governor, Henrik Nielsen Rosenkrantz, demolished St. John's and St. Peter's churches to improve the defence of his castle Visborgs slott. St. Mary's Cathedral remained the last functional church and became the new city parish.\nGotland was again taken into Sweden's possession in 1645, by the Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro, after 300\u00a0years of Danish rule. The city developed slowly as things were left as they were. In the mid 18th century, after a plague had reduced Visby's population, some attempts were made by Swedish government officials to improve living standards, but little was accomplished. Not until the early 19th century did Visby once again attract commerce and a harbour industry. At the same time \u2013 1808 \u2013 Gotland was conquered by Russia, but was peacefully taken back by the Swedes after only a couple of months.\nGeography.\nVisby is the name of the locality, or town, as well as the name of the larger area surrounding it, Visby socken. In 1936, the socken was incorporated within the newly formed Visby stad (Visby city), the only locality with historical city status on Gotland. Visby socken comprises the same area as the administrative Visby District, established on 1January 2016. As of 2019[ [update]], Visby Cathedral, Visborg Church and Terra Nova Church in Visby belong to Visby Cathedral parish (\"Visby Domkyrkof\u00f6rsamling\"). Visby is also the only municipality seat of Sweden that is accessible from the mainland only by boat and air traffic.\nVisby is situated on the central west coast of Gotland, on the rather steep slopes of limestone cliffs surrounding the first natural harbor. The town has evolved around the medieval harbor that now constitutes the Almedalen park. Long streets run parallel with the old shoreline with shorter alleys at a straight angle from these, lead from the harbor and up the slope up to the eastern higher part of town known as \"Klinten\".\nThe old, original part of Visby is more or less enclosed by the city wall to the north, east and south, with the old harbor and the Baltic Sea in the west. The more modern parts of the town expand mostly east and inland from the wall. Along the shore south of the wall is the modern harbor with its ferry terminals and further south is a green recreational area called S\u00f6dra H\u00e4llarna. Just inside the north part of the wall as well as along the north coast outside the wall, are several beaches: Kallbadhuset, Norderstrand, Sn\u00e4ckg\u00e4rdsbaden (or simply Sn\u00e4ck) and Gustavsvik.\nVisby and Tallinn are the only two North-European towns in which the city's medieval grid plan has been fully preserved into present day.\nOne of the asteroids in the asteroid belt, 6102 Visby, is named after this place.\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Visby has an oceanic climate (Cfb). This renders the summers cooler and the winters milder than in most of mainland Sweden. However, in spite of its maritime location the city's climate is very much influenced by continental airflows. Precipitation amounts are quite moderate, especially for an oceanic climate, and relatively consistent throughout the year. Visby is one of the sunniest towns in Sweden and in the Nordic countries, especially so during summer.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nVisby is linked to the mainland of Sweden by ferry and by plane. Ferries arrive from both Oskarshamn in Sm\u00e5land and Nyn\u00e4shamn, near Stockholm, each taking about three hours. The ferries are run by Destination Gotland and subsidized by the Swedish government. Destination Gotland is the only ferry operator \u2013 in summer 2016, independent shipping company Gotlandsb\u00e5ten ran ferries to V\u00e4stervik and Nyn\u00e4shamn, but this service was unprofitable and was not repeated in 2017.\nVisby Airport is located about north of the city and offers connections to the Swedish mainland. With 467,857 passengers in 2018, it is the 9th largest airport in Sweden. Daily flights to Stockholm Arlanda Airport is a common way to reach or depart from the island.\nThere are also city buses in Visby as well as buses to other parts of Gotland.\nVisby gave its name to the 1968 Visby Amendments, which were an amendment of the Hague Rules of shipping law, leading to the Hague\u2013Visby Rules.\nVisby was previously served by two railway lines, the Gotland Railway which ran from L\u00e4rbro in the north, to Burgsvik in the south, via Visby harbour and the Visby\u2013Visborgssl\u00e4tt\u2013Bj\u00e4rs Railway, south to Visborgssl\u00e4tt and V\u00e4sterhejde. The first line, from Visby to Hemse was started in 1878, under the auspices of the Gotland Railway. Passenger transport was discontinued in September 1960. Freight traffic on the Slakteriet \u2013 Visby port route ran until May 1962. The last sections of the port track in Visby were removed in March 1964. Visby railway station, just south of the S\u00f6derport on S\u00f6derv\u00e4g, was completed in 1878 and is one of the few remaining vestiges of the railway in Visby.\nUtilities.\nNear Visby, there is the static inverter plant for the first HVDC interconnection of a windpark (HVDC Visby\u2013N\u00e4s).\nSights and events.\nDuring the first week of July, Visby is the scene of the Almedalen Week, an important forum for everyone involved in Swedish politics. During the week, representatives from the major political parties in Sweden take turns giving speeches in the Almedalen park.\nIn August, the tourist season is at its peak. During week 32, from Sunday to Sunday, the annual Medieval Week on Gotland is held. During this week, regularly dressed tourists are outnumbered by people that are dressed in Medieval costumes. The festival started in 1984 and comprises a variety of events including music, jesters, theatre, a medieval market, and jousting tournaments.\nThe headquarters of the World Ecological Forum is located in Visby.\nCulture and the arts.\nVisby is home to the Baltic Centre for Writers and Translators and Visby International Centre for Composers.\nIn popular culture.\nSwedish author Mari Jungstedt set nine detective novels on the island of Gotland. The principal character, DS Anders Knutas, is based at police headquarters in Visby, and there are numerous descriptive passages of the city and the island.\nHayao Miyazaki noted that Visby is the main visual inspiration for the town in \"Kiki's Delivery Service\", with elements of other locations such as Stockholm also blended in.\nIn 1971, Ingmar Bergman filmed \"The Touch\" (\"Ber\u00f6ringen\") with Bibi Andersson, Max von Sydow and Elliott Gould in Visby.\nVisby is referenced in the Yorushika song, \"Rain with Cappuccino\".\nSports.\nCurrent sport.\nThe following sports clubs are located in Visby:\nFormer sport.\nMotorcycle speedway took place at the Gamla Speedway Track in Galgberget (directly opposite the junction of Hangarv\u00e4gen and Lummelundsv\u00e4g). The venue existed from 1951 until 2007 and hosted the Bysarna speedway team, who were four times league champions of Sweden. \nNotable people.\nA number of notable people have originated from Visby, they are included in the Gotland list.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48103", "revid": "39457116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48103", "title": "G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach", "text": "1979 book by Douglas Hofstadter\nG\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid (abbreviated as GEB) is a 1979 nonfiction book by American cognitive scientist\u00a0Douglas Hofstadter.\nBy exploring common themes in the lives and works of logician Kurt G\u00f6del, artist M. C. Escher, and composer Johann Sebastian Bach, the book expounds concepts fundamental to mathematics, symmetry, and intelligence. Through short stories, illustrations, and analysis, the book discusses how systems can acquire meaningful context despite being made of \"meaningless\" elements. It also discusses self-reference and formal rules, isomorphism, what it means to communicate, how knowledge can be represented and stored, the methods and limitations of symbolic representation, and even the fundamental notion of \"meaning\" itself.\nIn response to confusion over the book's theme, Hofstadter emphasized that \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\" is not about the relationships of mathematics, art, and music, but rather about how cognition emerges from hidden neurological mechanisms. One point in the book presents an analogy about how individual neurons in the brain coordinate to create a unified sense of a coherent mind by comparing it to the social organization displayed in a colony of ants.\n\"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\" won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction and the National Book Award for Science Hardcover.\nStructure.\n\"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\" takes the form of interweaving narratives. The main chapters alternate with dialogues between imaginary characters, usually Achilles and the tortoise, first used by Zeno of Elea and later by Lewis Carroll in \"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\". These origins are related in the first two dialogues, and later ones introduce new characters such as the Crab. These narratives frequently dip into self-reference and metafiction.\nWord play also features prominently in the work. Puns are occasionally used to connect ideas, such as the \"Magnificrab, Indeed\" with Bach's Magnificat in D; \"SHRDLU, Toy of Man's Designing\" with Bach's \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\"; and \"Typographical Number Theory\", or \"TNT\", which inevitably reacts explosively when it attempts to make statements about itself. One dialogue contains a story about a genie (from the Arabic \"Djinn\") and various \"tonics\" (of both the liquid and musical varieties), which is titled \"Djinn and Tonic\". Sometimes word play has no significant connection, such as the dialogue \"A Mu Offering\", which has no close affinity to Bach's \"The Musical Offering\".\nOne dialogue in the book is written in the form of a crab canon, in which every line before the midpoint corresponds to an identical line past the midpoint. The conversation still makes sense due to uses of common phrases that can be used as either greetings or farewells (\"Good day\") and the positioning of lines that double as an answer to a question in the next line. Another is a sloth canon, where one character repeats the lines of another, but slower and negated.\nThemes.\nThe book contains many instances of recursion and self-reference, where objects and ideas speak about or refer back to themselves. One is Quining, a term Hofstadter invented in homage to Willard Van Orman Quine, referring to programs that produce their own source code. Another is the presence of a fictional author in the index, Egbert B. Gebstadter, a man with initials E, G, and B and a surname that partially matches Hofstadter. A phonograph dubbed \"Record Player X\" destroys itself by playing a record titled \"I Cannot Be Played on Record Player X\" (an analogy to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems), an examination of canon form in music, and a discussion of Escher's lithograph of two hands drawing each other.\nTo describe such self-referencing objects, Hofstadter coins the term \"strange loop\", a concept he examines in more depth in his follow-up book \"I Am a Strange Loop\". To escape many of the logical contradictions brought about by these self-referencing objects, Hofstadter discusses Zen koans. He attempts to show readers how to perceive reality outside their own experience and embrace such paradoxical questions by rejecting the premise, a strategy also called \"unasking\".\nElements of computer science such as call stacks are also discussed in \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\", as one dialogue describes the adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise as they make use of \"pushing potion\" and \"popping tonic\" involving entering and leaving different layers of reality. The same dialogue has a genie with a lamp containing another genie with another lamp and so on. Subsequent sections discuss the basic tenets of logic, self-referring statements, (\"typeless\") systems, and even programming. Hofstadter further creates BlooP and FlooP, two simple programming languages, to illustrate his point.\nPuzzles.\nThe book is filled with puzzles, including Hofstadter's MU puzzle, which contrasts reasoning within a defined logical system with reasoning about that system. Another example can be found in the chapter titled \"Contracrostipunctus\", which combines the words \"acrostic\" and \"contrapunctus\" (counterpoint). In this dialogue between Achilles and the Tortoise, the author hints that there is a contrapunctal acrostic in the chapter that refers both to the author (Hofstadter) and Bach. This can be spelled out by taking the first word of each paragraph, to reveal \"Hofstadter's Contracrostipunctus Acrostically Backwards Spells J. S. Bach\". The second acrostic is found by taking the first letters of the words of the first, and reading them backwards to get \"J S Bach\", as the acrostic sentence self-referentially states.\nReception and impact.\n\"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\" won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction and the National Book Award for Science Hardcover.\nMartin Gardner's July 1979 column in \"Scientific American\" stated, \"Every few decades, an unknown author brings out a book of such depth, clarity, range, wit, beauty and originality that it is recognized at once as a major literary event.\"\nFor Summer 2007, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created an online course for high school students built around the book.\nIn its February 19, 2010, investigative summary on the 2001 anthrax attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation suggested that Bruce Edwards Ivins was inspired by the book to hide secret codes based upon nucleotide sequences in the anthrax-laced letters he allegedly sent in September and October 2001, using bold letters, as suggested on page 404 of the book. It was also suggested that he attempted to hide the book from investigators by throwing it in the trash.\nIn 2019, British mathematician Marcus du Sautoy curated a series of events at London's Barbican Centre to celebrate the book's fortieth anniversary.\n\"I Am a Strange Loop\".\nHofstadter has expressed some frustration with how \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\" was received. He felt that readers did not fully grasp that strange loops were supposed to be the central theme of the book, and attributed this confusion to the length of the book and the breadth of the topics covered.\nTo remedy this issue, Hofstadter published \"I Am a Strange Loop\" in 2007, which had a more focused discussion of the idea.\nTranslation.\nHofstadter claims the idea of translating his book \"never crossed [his] mind\" when he was writing it\u2014but when his publisher brought it up, he was \"very excited about seeing [the] book in other languages, especially\u2026 French.\" He knew, however, that \"there were a million issues to consider\" when translating, since the book relies not only on word-play, but on \"structural puns\" as well\u2014writing where the form and content of the work mirror each other (such as the \"Crab canon\" dialogue, which reads almost exactly the same forwards as backwards).\nHofstadter gives an example of translation trouble in the paragraph \"Mr. Tortoise, Meet Madame Tortue\", saying translators \"instantly ran headlong into the conflict between the feminine gender of the French noun \"tortue\" and the masculinity of my character, the Tortoise.\" Hofstadter agreed to the translators' suggestions of naming the French character \"Madame Tortue\", and the Italian version \"Signorina Tartaruga\". Because of other troubles translators might have retaining meaning, Hofstadter \"painstakingly went through every sentence of \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\", annotating a copy for translators into any language that might be targeted.\"\nTranslation also gave Hofstadter a way to add new meaning and puns. For instance, in Chinese, the subtitle is not a translation of \"an Eternal Golden Braid\", but a seemingly unrelated phrase \"J\u00ed Y\u00ec B\u00ec\" (\u96c6\u5f02\u74a7, literally \"collection of exotic jades\"), which is homophonic to \"GEB\" in Chinese. Some material regarding this interplay is in Hofstadter's later book, \"Le Ton beau de Marot\", which is mainly about translation.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48104", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48104", "title": "Locri", "text": "Locri is a town and \"comune\" (municipality) in the province of Reggio Calabria, Calabria, southern Italy. Its name derives from that of the ancient Greek region of Locris. Today it is an important administrative and cultural center on the Ionian Coast and within its province.\nHistory.\nEpizephyrian Locris or Locri Epizephyrii (; from the plural of (, \"a Locrian\"), (, \"on\"), (, \"West Wind\"), thus \"the Western Locrians\") was founded about 680 BC on the Italian shore of the Ionian Sea, near modern Capo Zefirio, by the Locrians, apparently by Opuntii (East Locrians) from the city of Opus, but including Ozolae (West Locrians) and Lacedaemonians. Its Latin name, \"Locri\", is the plural of the Latin \"Locrus\", which was used both to mean an inhabitant of Locris and the eponymous ancestor of the Locrians. Strabo suggests that the Ozolian Locrians were the principal founders, while Ephorus held that the Locri was a colony of Opuntian Locris.\nDue to fierce winds at an original settlement, the settlers moved to the present site. After a century, a defensive wall was built. Outside the city there are several necropoleis, some of which are very large.\nIts renowned lawgiver Zaleucus decreed that anyone who proposed a change in the laws should do so with a noose about their neck, with which they should be hanged if the amendment did not pass. Plato called it \"The flower of Italy\", due to the local peoples' characteristics. \nLocris was the site of two great sanctuaries, that of Persephone and of Aphrodite. Perhaps uniquely, Persephone was worshiped as protector of marriage and childbirth, a role usually assumed by Hera, and Diodorus Siculus knew the temple there as the most illustrious in Italy.\nIn the early centuries Locris was allied with Sparta, and later with Syracuse. It founded two colonies of its own, Hipponion and Medma.\nDuring the 5th century BC, votive pinakes in terracotta were often dedicated as offerings to the goddess, made in series and painted with bright colors, animated by scenes connected to the myth of Persephone. Many of these pinakes are now on display in the National Museum of Magna Gr\u00e6cia in Reggio Calabria. Locrian pinakes represent one of the most significant categories of objects from Magna Graecia, both as documents of religious practice and as works of art.\nIn the iconography of votive plaques at Locri, her abduction and marriage to Hades served as an emblem of the marital state, children at Locri were dedicated to Persephone, and maidens about to be wed brought their peplos to be blessed.\nDuring the Pyrrhic Wars (280-275 BC) fought between Pyrrhus of Epirus and Rome, Locris accepted a Roman garrison and fought against the Epirote king. However, the city changed sides numerous times during the war. Bronze tablets from the treasury of its Olympeum, a temple to Zeus, record payments to a 'king', generally thought to be Pyrrhus. Despite this, Pyrrhus plundered the temple of Persephone at Locris before his return to Epirus, an event which would live on in the memory of the Greeks of Italy. At the end of the war, perhaps to allay fears about its loyalty, Locris minted coins depicting a seated Rome being crowned by 'Pistis', a goddess personifying good faith and loyalty, and returned to the Roman fold.\nThe city was abandoned in the 5th century AD. The town was finally destroyed by the Saracens in 915. The survivors fled inland about to the town Gerace on the slopes of the Aspromonte.\nModern Locri.\nAfter 1850 Gerace developed along the coast, forming a new centre Gerace Marina, to house new public buildings and a railway station. In 1934 it changed its name in Locri, which is now the administrative centre of the Locride area. The city boasts a National Museum and an Archaeological Park. Apart from the archeological sites, the town is also an important sea-side resort along the \"Costa dei Gelsomini\", or Jasmine Coast, one of the wildest coastlines of Italy.\nLocri, with over 12,000 inhabitants, is an important administrative and cultural centre on the Ionian Coast, in the Italian Province of Reggio Calabria. The town is easily reached by plane; in fact, it is only 90 minutes away from the International Airport of Lamezia Terme and from the Airport of Reggio Calabria. Locri is well connected to all regional and national towns and cities by train, shuttle, taxi, and bus. The A2 autoroute makes Locri easy to reach by car, too. \nSicily is accessible by ferry boat from Villa San Giovanni or Reggio Calabria, both of which are a car or a train journey away from Locri. There are several hotels, residences, hostels, and bed&amp;breakfast establishments where tourists and visitors can find comfortable accommodation for their stay. The Tourist Information Centre can offer assistance and information on matters of accommodation.\nIn Locri, you can find many administrative bodies and public services, such as a criminal and civil court, a revenue agency, a police station, travel agencies, three post offices (two of which have ATM facilities), banks, the State Archive, the City Hall (built in 1880), trade unions, the bishop's office, several Catholic churches, and an Indian and an Evangelical church. The city is also home to the most important hospital of the area, an emergency medical service, many private doctors, and three pharmacies. There are in the locality several state schools \u2013 including Elementary Schools, High Schools, Lyceums, and Vocational Schools \u2013 as well as private schools and two private English language schools .\nThe city boasts a National Museum and an Archaeological Park, two cinemas, two cultural centres, a theatre, and a library. In Locri you will find many shops, restaurants, pizzerias, fast food outlets, pubs, bars, cafeterias, patisseries, farm restaurants, fruit and vegetable market halls, florists, supermarkets, and shopping malls. You also have facilities for a wide range of sports, including soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, snorkeling, fishing and diving, and, because there is nearby hilly and mountainous terrain, trekking and hiking are further options. Finally, being a seaside city, Locri can offer enjoyable walks on the sea-front boulevard or on the beach and in the summer months it plays host to an assortment of beach-side lidos.\nMain sights.\nIonic temple of Maras\u00e0.\nIn the first half of the fifth century BC, the Locrians demolished their archaic temple and rebuilt a new temple in the Ionic style. The temple was designed by Syracusan architects around 470 BC, based on the idea of Hiero I of Syracuse.\nThe new temple occupies the same place as the previous one but it has a different orientation. The temple was destroyed in the 11th century. The dimensions of the temple were . The cella is free of supports on the central axes. The pronaos had two columns. The temple has seventeen Ionic columns on the long side, and six on the front. The height of the temple was .\nAccording to Italian scholar Margherita Guarducci, the famous Ludovisi Throne comes from the temple of Aphrodite of Epizephyrian Locris, where it was used as the parapet of the bothros. This theory is strengthened by the measures of the sculpture which fit perfectly together with the three great stones of the covering of the \"bothros\"; stones still existing and open to visits inside the archaeological area of the Temple of contrada Maras\u00e0.\nThe theatre.\nThe theatre was built in the fourth century BC not far from the ancient city, \nin the Contrada Pirettina, taking advantage of a hillside slope. The original structure had space for more than 4,500 people; now only the central part of the theatre is visible.\nPart of the Cavea was cut into the rocks. Each plane was divided in 7 wedges between 6 scales. A horizontal separation divided the upper theater from the lower theatre.\nLudovisi Throne.\nIn 1982, the exquisite and famous Ludovisi Throne, found reused in the ancient Roman gardens of Sallust in 1887, was securely linked to the newly studied Ionic temple at Maras\u00e0, in Locri. A reconstruction of the throne was shown to fit exactly into remaining blocks in the temple's foundations, and it has been suggested that terracotta votive plaques, or pinakes, of cults at Epizephyrian Locris, are the only stylistic parallel to the Throne.\nThe marble sculpture, in its bas-relief decoration, represents on the front side Aphrodite born from the sea foam (but some scholars sees in it the representation of Persephone coming back from the Hades) and helped by two maidservants to raise from the water, while on the left side is represented a naked flute-girl seated on a cushion and playing the double-flute, and on the right side a veiled woman using an incense-burner.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His most notable creation was Miffy (\"Nijntje\" in the original Dutch), a small rabbit drawn with heavy graphic lines, simple shapes and primary colours. Bruna also created stories for characters such as Boris Bear, Poppy Pig, Snuffy, Lottie, Farmer John, Kitty Nelly, and Hettie Hedgehog.\nAside from his prolific catalog of children's books, Bruna also illustrated and designed book covers, posters and promotional materials for his father's publishing company A.W. Bruna &amp; Zoon. His most popular designs graced the covers of the Zwarte Beertjes (English, \"little black bears\") series of books. Well known among his designs are those for Simenon's Maigret books, typified by graphic silhouettes of a pipe on various backgrounds.\nBiography.\nDick Bruna's father, A. W. Bruna, directed the family-owned publishing company Bruna, with his brother Henk Bruna. His father's intentions were for Bruna to follow in his footsteps, but Bruna had different plans and wanted to be an artist. He traveled to London and lived for a while in Paris, where he fell under the influence of Fernand L\u00e9ger, Pablo Picasso, and especially Henri Matisse. Back in the Netherlands he attended the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam but soon quit; he said afterwards that he had no talent as a painter and could not draw perspective.\nIn 1955, while on family holiday, he saw a rabbit hopping around and later made attempts to draw it, thereby creating \"Nijntje\" (\"Miffy\" in English), the word a Dutch child might use as the diminutive for \"konijntje\", \"little rabbit\".\nBruna illustrated over 2,000 covers and over 100 posters for the family business, A.W. Bruna &amp; Zoon. But when the Amsterdam company Art Unlimited decided to publish Poster &amp; Postcards following Roby Bellemans traveling international exhibitions with Dutch and other children book illustrators, Dick Bruna approached Roby about this collaboration and decided to let Art Unlimited publish his \u201cNijntje\u201d cards. \nHis most recognized illustrations were for the Zwarte Beertjes (English: little black bears) series of books, including The Saint, James Bond, Simenon, and Shakespeare. He has said that the Japanese character Hello Kitty was copied from Miffy.\nIn 2014, Bruna announced his retirement, after which the rights to the Miffy character were not to be sold. In March 2016 he was awarded the Max Velthuijs-prijs.\nBruna died of natural causes in his sleep in Utrecht on 16 February 2017 at the age of 89.\nBibliography (as children's author).\nBruna published 120 children's book titles, the last being \"Miffy is Naughty\" in 2017.\nInfluences.\nAt a young age Bruna started drawing, but was also influenced by artists of other art forms. He drew covers for his school newspaper in Walt Disney style. Later he admired Rembrandt and Van Gogh.\nThe biggest influence was perhaps Matisse. Dick Bruna's first works were based on collages by the French painter. Bruna has also been noted to have been influenced by the Dutch graphic design movement, De Stijl, in particular the work of architect Gerrit Rietveld.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The original Dutch name, \"nijntje\", is a shortening of the diminutive \"konijntje\", \"little rabbit\".\nThe first Miffy book was produced in 1955 and over thirty others have followed. In total they have sold over 100 million copies. In addition, four separate television series as well as items such as clothes and toys featuring the character followed. On 30 January 2013, a feature-length film, \"Miffy the Movie\", was released in theaters and stars Eva Poppink in the title role.\nFour television series based on the character have been produced: \"Dick Bruna's Miffy Storybook Classics\" from 1984; \"Miffy: Colors, Numbers, and Shapes\" from 1996; \"Miffy and Friends\" from 2003; and \"Miffy's Adventures Big and Small\" from 2015.\nCreation and design.\nMiffy was created in 1955 after Bruna had been telling his one-year-old son, Sierk, stories about a little rabbit they had seen earlier in the dunes, while on holiday at Egmond aan Zee. Miffy became a female after Bruna decided that he wanted to draw a dress and not trousers on his rabbit. \nAt first Miffy looked like a toy animal with floppy ears, but by 1963, her design was changed to her current incarnation, a stylized form of a rabbit. Miffy is drawn in a graphic style, with minimalist black graphic lines. Bruna chose to only use black, white, the primary colours (red, yellow, and blue), green, orange, brown, and grey. It is his use of primarily primary colors that makes Miffy instantly recognisable, and also popular with preschoolers, because of her bright and intense simplistic colours.\nThe simplicity of Miffy\u2019s design not only appeals to young children but also reflects Bruna\u2019s philosophy of clear and direct storytelling, which has helped the character endure over decades as a beloved figure in children\u2019s literature.\nBooks.\nAlmost 32 Miffy titles have been published and many more for the other characters. Bruna has produced a total of 124 picture books for children. The Miffy books each contain twelve pages of story. Each page has one illustration and four lines of verse, the last word of the second line rhymes with the last of the fourth. They are written about things that children can understand, and situations they will face such as going to the hospital and going to school, and they always have a happy ending. Some books have no text at all, such as \"Miffy's Dream\".\nThe books are printed in small format. Bruna considers it important that his audience feels that his books are there for them, not for their parents. Most Miffy books have an advisory reading level of age four to eight years.\nBruna's books have been translated into more than 50 different languages, and over 85 million copies have been sold all over the world. It is also translated in dialects, including in Zeelandic by Engel Reinhoudt. Dick Bruna has won many awards for his books, such as the Golden Brush in 1990, for \"Boris Bear\" and the Silver Brush for \"Miffy In The Tent\" in 1996. In 1997, he was awarded the Silver Slate for \"Dear Grandma Bunny\", a book where Miffy's grandmother was sick and died.\nThe other characters that appear in the books are her family: Miffy's parents, her Grandma and Grandpa, her Auntie Alice, and 'Uncle Bob', a family friend, who appears in \"Miffy Goes Flying\". A new brother or sister for Miffy is introduced in \"Miffy And The New Baby\". She also has many friends, Boris and Barbara Bear, who first appeared in 1989 and are boyfriend and girlfriend, Poppy Pig, who appeared in 1977, and her niece Grunty, Snuffy, who appeared in 1969, and other bunnies such as Aggie and Melanie.\nTelevision.\nMiffy appeared in her first TV show in 1984, called \"Dick Bruna's Miffy Storybook Classics: The Original Series\". Directed by veteran animator Gene Deitch, each episode was traditionally animated and ran for approximately five minutes. The show aired in the Netherlands on KRO, in the United Kingdom on ITV, in Canada on TVOntario in Australia on ABC, and in the USA on Cartoon Network's Small World block with VHS releases from Geneon USA, episodes of the show were later included as Bonus Features on \"Miffy and Friends\" DVDs.\nFrom 2003 to 2007, \"Miffy and Friends\" aired on children's television channels such as Treehouse in Canada, and Noggin in the USA. The show added several new characters, such as Melanie's African family and the family of Boris' and Barbara's common cousin, Umik. The series was produced by Pedri Animation BV, a Dutch stop-motion animation company. It was voiced simply by a feminine storytelling narrator. \"Miffy's Adventures Big and Small\" premiered 2 October 2015. It currently has a total of six seasons. It airs on the Nick Jr. Channel in the USA.\nIn October 2023, the fifth series was announced and will premiere in 2025 on Canal+ in France. It will be produced by StudioCanal, Mercis and Superprod Animation. This series will also feature the debut of Miffy's younger brother, Bun.\nConflicts with Sanrio.\nMiffy is sometimes assumed to be a Japanese character, because Sanrio's Hello Kitty, introduced in 1974, is rendered using a similar line style. The Miffy brand is popular in Japan, with strong sales of Japanese-made Miffy merchandise. In an interview for \"The Daily Telegraph\", Bruna expressed his dislike for Hello Kitty. \"'That,' he says darkly, 'is a copy [of Miffy], I think. I don't like that at all. I always think, \"No, don't do that. Try to make something that you think of yourself\". In 1999, Miffy was the ninth top-selling character in Japan, where licensed merchandise sold \u00a5 ($).\nIn addition, on 26 August 2010, Mercis BV, representing Bruna, brought suit against Sanrio with the claim that one of Hello Kitty's companion characters, a rabbit named Cathy, infringes on the copyright and trademark of Miffy. On 2 November 2010, a Dutch court ruled against Sanrio and ordered the company to stop marketing Cathy products in Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. On 7 June 2011, following the T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Sanrio and Mercis reached an out-of-court settlement requiring Sanrio to halt production of merchandise that features Cathy. Instead of continuing the court battle, the two companies announced that they would donate the legal fees to help the earthquake victims.\nLegacy.\nIn the early 1990s, an image of Miffy holding an adjustable spanner coyly behind her back appeared on flyers produced by people taking direct action against the UK government's road building program. This unauthorised use of the character spread and Miffy became a mascot for groups involved in radical ecological direct action.\nIn Bruna's hometown, Utrecht, a square was named after Miffy (Nijntje), the Nijntjepleintje (lit: Little Miffy Square, the diminutive for square in Dutch: plein\"tje\" retains the rhyme with nijntje as the ij and ei digraphs are pronounced identical in Dutch ). In 2006, the Centraal Museum opened a permanent exhibition, the \"dick bruna huis\" (Dick Bruna house). Bruna distributed all DVDs from miffy with Warner Home Video. In 2015, Bridge Entertainment DVD acquired bruna's home videos.\nMiffy celebrated her fiftieth birthday in 2005. This was marked in cities across the globe, for example, at the Manchester Art Gallery in England. She also serves a \"celebrity character spokesperson\" for UNICEF.\nMiffy's namesakes include a new species of booklouse from Peru. The insect was given the scientific name \"Trichadenotecnum miffy\" in 2008, because its epiproct, an appendage on its abdomen, resembles a small rabbit.\nIn July 2014, Bruna announced his retirement; the rights to the Miffy character were not sold. On 16 February 2017, Dick Bruna died at the age of 89.\nIn 2021, Miffy collaborated with Converse to capsule menswear collection in the Netherlands to celebrate the creator of Miffy, Dick Bruna. In December 2022, Tommy Hilfiger announced its new collection with Miffy as the main attraction for the new partnership in celebration of the Lunar New Year of the Rabbit.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Harding spent much of her early life training, eventually dropping out of high school to devote her time to the sport. After climbing the ranks in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships between 1986 and 1989, Harding won the 1989 Skate America competition. She was the 1991 and 1994 U.S. champion (the latter title was later vacated), and 1991 World silver medalist. In 1991, she became the first American woman and the second woman in history (after Midori Ito) to successfully land a triple Axel in an international competition. Harding is a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion.\nIn January 1994, Harding became embroiled in controversy when her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, orchestrated an attack on her fellow U.S. skating rival Nancy Kerrigan. On March 16, 1994, Harding accepted a plea bargain in which she pled guilty to conspiracy to hinder prosecution. As a result of her involvement in covering up the assault, the United States Figure Skating Association banned her for life on June 30, 1994; she was stripped of her 1994 title.\nFrom 2003 to 2004, Harding competed as a professional boxer. Her life has been the subject of many books, films, documentaries, and academic studies. In 2014, two television documentaries were made about Harding's life and skating career (\"Nancy &amp; Tonya\" and \"The Price of Gold\"), inspiring Steven Rogers to write the film \"I,\u00a0Tonya\" in 2017, which Margot Robbie portrayed Harding. In 2018, she was a contestant on season 26 of \"Dancing with the Stars\", finishing in third place. In 2019, she won season 16 of \"Worst Cooks in America\".\nEarly life.\nTonya Maxene Harding was born November 12, 1970, in Portland, Oregon, to LaVona Golden (b. 1940) and Albert Harding (1933\u20132009). During Harding's youth, her father held various odd jobs (managed apartments, drove a truck, and worked at a bait &amp; tackle store), yet was often underemployed due to poor health. She was raised in East Portland, and began skating at age three, training with coach Diane Rawlinson. Harding also hunted, drag raced, and learned auto mechanics from her father. LaVona struggled to support the family while working as a waitress, and hand-sewed her daughter's skating costumes to save money. Harding's parents divorced after 19 years of marriage in 1987, when she was 16. She dropped out of Milwaukie High School during her sophomore year to focus on skating; she earned a General Educational Development (GED) Certificate in 1988.\nHarding claimed she was frequently abused by her mother. She stated that by the time she was seven years old, physical and psychological abuse had become a regular part of her life. LaVona admitted to one instance of hitting Harding at an ice rink. In January 2018, Harding's childhood friend and filmmaker, Sandra Luckow, spoke in defense of Harding's mother, because she felt that the 2017 film \"I, Tonya\" stretched some truths about LaVona's character. Luckow said that although Harding's mother could be \"egregious\" towards her daughter, LaVona funded and appreciated Harding's skating lessons, and had \"a huge amount of humanity.\"\nIn Harding's 2008 authorized biography, \"The Tonya Tapes\" (written by Lynda D. Prouse from recorded interviews with Harding), she said she was the victim of acquaintance rape in 1991, and that her half-brother, Chris Davison, molested her on several occasions when she was a child. In 1986, Harding called the police after Davison had been sexually harassing and terrorizing her. He was arrested, and spent a short time in prison. Harding said her parents were in denial about Davison's behavior, and told her not to press criminal charges against him. Davison was killed in an unsolved vehicular hit-and-run accident in 1988. On May 3, 1994, during an interview with Rolonda Watts, Harding said that Davison was the only person in her life unworthy of forgiveness, and \"the only person I've ever hated.\"\nSkating career.\nHarding trained as a figure skater throughout her youth with coach Diane Rawlinson. In the mid-1980s, Harding began working her way up the competitive skating ladder. She placed sixth at the 1986 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, fifth in 1987 and 1988, and third in 1989. After competing in the February 1989 Nationals Championship, Harding began training with Dody Teachman. She then won the October 1989 Skate America competition, and was considered a strong contender at the February 1990 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. However, she was experiencing the flu and asthma, and had a poor free skate. After the original program, she dropped from second place and finished seventh.\nHarding's breakthrough year came in 1991 when, at the U.S. Championships, she completed her first triple Axel in competition on February 16\u2014becoming the first American woman to do so. She landed seven triple jumps in the long program, including the Axel. She won the 1991 U.S. Ladies' Singles title with the event's first 6.0 technical merit score since Janet Lynn's 1973 performance at the U.S. Championships. She won the long program when seven of the nine judges gave her first place. She scored eight 5.9s and one 6.0 for technical merit, and six 5.9s, one 5.8, and two 5.7s for composition and style. At the March 1991 World Championships, she again completed the triple Axel. Harding would finish second behind Kristi Yamaguchi and in front of Nancy Kerrigan, marking the first time one country swept the ladies' medal podium at the World Figure Skating Championships.\nAt the September 1991 Skate America competition, Harding recorded three more firsts:\nDespite these record-breaking performances, after 1991, Harding was never again able to successfully complete the triple Axel in competition; her competitive results began to decline. She and Dody Teachman had briefly parted ways in April 1991, but then reunited in June; Harding was still training under Teachman for the upcoming 1992 season. She placed third in the January 1992 U.S. Figure Skating Championships despite twisting her ankle during practice, and finished fourth in the February 1992 Winter Olympics. On March 1, 1992, Harding gave Teachman a summary dismissal, and returned to Diane Rawlinson to be coached by her. On March 29, Harding placed sixth in the 1992 World Championships, although she had a better placement at the November 1992 Skate Canada International event, in which she finished fourth. In the 1993 season, she skated poorly in the U.S. Championships and failed to qualify for the World Championship team.\nIn January 1994, Harding won the U.S. Championships, but was later stripped of her title: the USFSA disciplinary panel voted to vacate the title in June 1994, following an investigation of the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. In February 1994, Harding was permitted to remain a member of the U.S. Olympic ice skating team, despite brief legal controversy. At the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, after an issue with a broken skate lace in the long program, she was given a re-skate by the judges and finished in eighth place, behind Oksana Baiul (gold) and Nancy Kerrigan (silver). Despite her USFSA ban, she did later compete at the professional level, placing second at the ESPN Pro Skating Championship in 1999.\nCompetitive highlights.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAssault of Nancy Kerrigan and legal proceedings.\nNancy Kerrigan.\nOn , one day before the U.S. Figure Skating Championship first Ladies' Singles competition, Nancy Kerrigan was attacked in a corridor after a practice session at the Detroit Cobo Arena. The aftermath of the attack was recorded on a news camera and broadcast around the world. The assailant was Shane Stant, contracted to break her right knee; he turned himself in to the FBI in Phoenix on January 14. Stant and his uncle, Derrick Smith, were hired for this assault by Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt. After failing to find Kerrigan in Massachusetts, Stant had taken a 20-hour bus trip to Detroit. Nancy Kerrigan was walking behind a curtain when Stant rushed behind her. Using both hands, he swung a 21-inch (53\u00a0cm) ASP telescopic baton at her right leg, striking above her knee. The attack was intended to seriously injure Kerrigan so that she could not compete in the Nationals (Kerrigan was the defending 1993 Champion) nor the Winter Olympics. Kerrigan's leg was not broken but was severely bruised, forcing her to withdraw from the Championships, and forgo competing to retain the U.S. Ladies' title. On January 8, Harding won the U.S. title; she and Kerrigan were then both selected for the 1994 Olympic team.\nKOIN-TV interview, Eckardt and Smith arrests, USFSA comments.\nOn January 11, Harding was interviewed for KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon. Harding was asked whether someone she knew could have planned the attack. Harding replied, \"I have definitely thought about it.\" Gillooly stood in her view behind the camera during the interview. The interview ended with Harding saying, \"No one controls my life but me... if there's something in there that I don't like, I'm going to change it.\" Harding also confirmed she had spoken with FBI agents in Detroit and again in Portland. On January 13, Eckardt and Smith were arrested. On January 14, the United States Figure Skating Association (USFSA) made a statement on whether Eckardt's arrest affected Harding's Olympic placement: \"We will deal only with the facts.\" Harding's and Gillooly's separate lawyers confirmed the couple were in daily contact and cooperation with law enforcement. On January 15, Harding and Gillooly spoke with reporters, but declined to comment about the investigation. On January 16, Harding's lawyer held a press conference, in which he read a statement denying Harding's involvement in the attack on Kerrigan. Harding left her home that evening to practice with her coaches, where she spoke with reporters and performed a triple Axel.\nHarding's confession.\nOn January 18, 1994, Harding was with her lawyers when she submitted to questioning by the DA and FBI. She was interviewed for over ten hours. Eight hours into the interview, her lawyer read a statement declaring her separation from Gillooly: \"I continue to believe that Jeff is innocent of any wrongdoing. I wish him nothing but the best.\" Her full FBI transcript was released on February 1. \"The Seattle Times\" reported on the transcript, stating that Harding had \"changed her story well into a long interview [...] After hours of denying any involvement in trying to cover up the plot, an FBI agent finally told [her] that he knew she had lied to him, that he would tell her exactly how she had lied to him.\" In the transcript's final passage, Harding stated, \"I hope everyone understands. I'm telling on someone I really care about. I know now [Jeff] is involved. I'm sorry.\" On January 19, Gillooly surrendered to the FBI. On January 20, Diane Sawyer asked Harding on \"Primetime\" about the case. Harding said she had done nothing wrong. On January 27, it was reported that Gillooly had been testifying about the attack plot since January 26, possibly implicating Harding as allegedly assisting. Harding's close friend, Stephanie Quintero, with whom she was living, spoke to reporters on her behalf: \"[Tonya] was shocked, very hurt. She was believing in [Jeff].\" Harding later held a press conference to read a prepared statement. She said she was sorry Kerrigan was attacked, that she respected Kerrigan, and claimed not to have known in advance of the plot to disable her. Harding took responsibility \"for failing to report things [about the assault] when I returned home from Nationals [on January 10]. Failure to immediately report this information is not a crime.\" Many states' laws, including Oregon's, state that the act of concealing criminal knowledge alone is not a crime.\nThe attack on Kerrigan received a substantial amount of publicity, and news media crews camped outside Kerrigan's home. In January 1994, the story was on the covers of \"Sports Illustrated\", \"Newsweek\", and \"Time\". There was now much speculation about Harding's alleged involvement in the assault plot. Because Harding and Kerrigan would be representing the US in the February Lillehammer Olympics, speculation reached a media frenzy. Abby Haight and J.E. Vader, reporters for \"The Oregonian\", wrote a biography of Harding called \"Fire on Ice\", which included excerpts of her January 18 FBI interview.\nGuilty pleas and sentencing of Gillooly, Eckardt, Stant, and Smith.\nOn February 1, 1994, Gillooly's attorney negotiated a plea bargain in exchange for testimony regarding all involved parties in the attack. In July, he was sentenced to two years in prison and publicly apologized to Kerrigan, adding \"any apology coming from me rings hollow.\" Gillooly and Eckardt pled guilty to racketeering; Stant and Smith (who drove the getaway car and funneled money) pled guilty to conspiracy to commit second-degree assault. Judge Donald Londer noted the attack could have injured Kerrigan more seriously. Eckardt died in 2007.\nUSFSA disciplinary panel.\nOn February 5, 1994, the USFSA disciplinary panel stated there were reasonable grounds to believe Harding had violated the sport's code of ethics. Her admitted failure to report about an assault on a fellow competitor, supported by her FBI transcripts, led to Harding being formally charged with \"[making] false statements about her knowledge.\" The USFSA recommended that she face a disciplinary hearing. Claire Ferguson, president of the USFSA, decided not to suspend Harding's membership before a hearing took place. If she had been suspended, she likely still would have competed at the Olympics after filing suit, seeking an injunction against the USFSA, and asserting her rights under the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. The panel examined evidence, including: the testimonies of Stant and Smith, Harding's and Gillooly's telephone records, and notes found in a Portland saloon trash bin on January 30. Harding was given 30 days to respond.\nHarding and Connie Chung travel to Norway.\nNews media began attending Harding's Portland practices, and also filmed her on February 7, running barefoot to stop a tow truck from hauling her illegally parked vehicle. On February 10, 1994, Connie Chung interviewed Harding. When asked about Gillooly, Harding said: \"I never did anything to hurt [Jeff]. If I ever did anything, it was to stick up for him and protect him.\" Chung also negotiated to fly on the same airplane with Harding to Oslo, leaving on February 15. Chung admitted she would not have travelled to Norway were it not for the scandal.\nKerrigan and Harding share ice; Harding finishes eighth.\nOn February 17, 1994, Harding and Kerrigan shared the ice at a practice session in the Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. Approximately 400 members of the press were there to document the practice. Scott Hamilton thought the sport was depicted as a \"tabloid event.\" It was noted that Nancy Kerrigan chose to wear the same skating costume at the practice session that she was wearing when Stant attacked her. Kerrigan later confirmed that her choice of dress that day was deliberate: \"Humor is good, it's empowering.\" The tape-delayed broadcast of the February 23 Ladies' Olympic technical program is one of the most watched telecasts in the US. On February 25, Harding finished eighth in the Olympics; a bootlace broke early in her free skate routine, and amid jeers from the crowd, she was allowed to restart. Nancy Kerrigan, having recovered from her injury, won silver behind Oksana Baiul from Ukraine.\nGuilty plea, admissions.\nOn March 9, 1994, Judge Owen Panner granted Harding a requested stay until June on her disciplinary hearing. Meanwhile, Portland authorities stated the criminal investigation would conclude by March 21, with any indictments and a grand jury report to be made at that time.\nOn March 16, 1994, Harding pled guilty to conspiracy to hinder prosecution as a Class C felony offense at a Multnomah County court hearing. She and her lawyer, Robert Weaver, negotiated a plea bargain ensuring no further prosecution. Judge Donald Londer conducted routine questioning to make certain Harding understood her agreement, that she was entering her plea \"knowingly and voluntarily.\" Harding told Londer she was. Her plea admissions were: knowing of the assault plot after the fact; settling on a cover story with Gillooly and Eckardt on January 10; witnessing pay phone calls to Smith affirming the story on January 10 and 11; and lying to FBI with the story on January 18. Law enforcement had known about the pay phone calls, as investigators had been following and videotaping the co-conspirators since January 10. Her penalties included three years of probation, a $100,000 fine, and 500 hours of community service. She agreed to reimburse Multnomah County $10,000 in legal expenses, undergo a psychiatric examination, and volunteered to give $50,000 to the Special Olympics Oregon (SOOR) charity. Oregon sentencing guidelines carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison.\nHarding's plea conditions imposed her U.S. Figure Skating Association resignation, necessitating her withdrawal from the 1994 Worlds (for which she was scheduled to leave on March 17). District attorney Norman Frink said if Harding had not agreed to the plea, she would have faced \"an indictment on all possible charges...punishment was taking away [skating] privilege.\"\nResponse from defense and USFSA.\nPhil Knight, CEO of Nike, donated $25,000 toward Harding's legal fees. She had also made approximately $600,000 from an \"Inside Edition\" deal.\nWeaver said the plea agreement was satisfactory to Harding, partly because she avoided prison: \"We would have prevailed at trial.\" An executive of the USFSA commented, \"[We] don't know if Tonya is innocent or guilty...if [she was involved before] the national championship.\" On March 18, Claire Ferguson decided Harding's disciplinary hearing would proceed in June. The USFSA's executive committee met to discuss Harding seeking reinstatement, and whether they might strip her of the 1994 National Championship title. Neither issue was decided at that time.\nGrand jury indictment.\nOn March 21, 1994, a Portland grand jury issued an indictment stating there was evidence Harding participated in the attack plot. The indictment concluded more than two months of investigation and witness testimonies from Diane Rawlinson; Harding's choreographer Erika Bakacs; freelance figure skating writer Vera Marano; and Eckardt's college instructor and classmates. It stated there was evidence Harding fraudulently used USFSA-provided skating monies to finance the assault. It also read that Harding, Gillooly, Eckardt, Smith, and Stant agreed to \"knowingly cause physical injury ... by means of a dangerous weapon.\" The grand jury said the evidence implied Harding was \"involved from the beginning or very close.\" She was not charged in the indictment due to the terms of her March 16 plea agreement.\nUSFSA disciplinary panel meeting in June.\nOn June 29, 1994, the USFSA disciplinary panel met for nine hours over two days to consider Harding's alleged role in the attack. On June 30, chairman William Hybl stated,\n \"By a preponderance of the evidence, the panel did conclude that she had prior knowledge and was involved prior to the incident. This is based on civil standards, not criminal standards ... bank records, phone records \u2013 the way they came together to establish a case.\"\nThe panel decided that pertinent FBI reports, court documents, and Harding's March 16 plea agreement presented:\n \"a clear disregard for fairness, good sportsmanship, and ethical behaviour.\"\nHarding did not attend or participate in the two-day hearing. Weaver said the decision disappointed her, but was not a surprise, and that she had not decided on an appeal. Harding was stripped of her 1994 U.S. Championship title, and banned for life from participating in USFSA events as either a skater or coach. The USFSA has no authority over professional skating events, but after the scandal, Harding was \"persona non grata\" on the pro circuit. Few skaters and promoters would work with her, and she did not benefit from the ensuing boom in professional skating after the scandal.\nLater interviews.\nShortly before the 1998 Winter Olympics, the CBS and Fox news divisions re-examined the scandal for two televised special reports. Harry Smith hosted the CBS special. Harding still held to her statement from her press conference given on January 27, 1994: \"I had no prior knowledge of the planned assault on Nancy Kerrigan.\" Smith then interviewed Kerrigan, asking how she responded to that statement. Kerrigan referred to transcripts she had read from Harding's FBI interview on January 18, 1994. After reading through the interrogation of that day, she concluded that \"[Tonya] knew more than she admits.\" The Fox special report was called \"Breaking the Ice: The Women of '94 Revisited\", hosted by James Brown, and featured interviews of Harding, Gillooly, and Kerrigan. Gillooly (granted a name change to Jeff Stone in 1995) said that Harding having avoided prison did not anger him, and that he felt his own punishment was just. Stone reflected on Harding's position of \"limited involvement\" in Kerrigan's attack, and speculated that a \"guilty conscience\" still troubled her. Brown then mediated a joint interview with both Kerrigan and Harding present. The two former competitors shared sincere desires for happy families and general well-wishes. Kerrigan said that she hoped Harding could learn from past mistakes and \"find happiness.\" Harding said she was grateful to personally express remorse to Kerrigan again.\nIn Harding's 2008 biography, \"The Tonya Tapes\" (transcribed by Lynda D. Prouse from recorded interviews), she stated that she wanted to call the FBI in 1994 to reveal what she knew, but decided not to when Gillooly allegedly threatened her with death following a gunpoint gang rape by him and two other men she did not know. Gillooly responded with surprise that \"groundless claims\" against him could be published and specifically contended her gang rape accusation to be \"utterly ridiculous.\" In 2013, \"Deadspin\" sought Gillooly for an interview, and he again defended himself against the gunpoint gang rape allegation. He expressed regret that Harding is often \"remembered for what I talked her into doing,\" meaning allegedly plotting to injure Kerrigan. Gillooly admitted that his past \"stupidity\" was part of Harding's 1994 ruin, and maintained that he still considered her a great figure skater. He also said, \"I've had it easy, compared to poor Tonya... she tends to be the butt of the joke. It's kind of sad to me.\"\nIn 2014, Nancy Kerrigan addressed the scandal during a brief interview with sportscaster Bob Costas: \"Whatever apology Tonya has given, I accept it. It's time for all us\u2014I've always wished [Tonya] well. She has her own family, I have my family. It's time to make that our focus, and move on with our lives.\"\nLater career.\nOn February 15, 1994, an explicit 1991 videotape clip of Harding topless was shown on \"A Current Affair\"; three still frames from this clip were also published in \"The Sun\" (a British tabloid newspaper). The \"New York Post\" reported that Gillooly had supplied the videotaped fragment for an undisclosed sum of money.\nOn June 22, 1994, in Portland, Oregon, Harding appeared on an AAA professional wrestling show as the manager for wrestling stable Los Gringos Locos. The night's performance included Art Barr and Eddie Guerrero. A promotional musical event was unsuccessful when Harding and her band, the Golden Blades, were booed off the stage at their only performance, in 1995 in Portland.\nOn July 26, 1994, \"Penthouse\" announced that its September issue would feature different stills of Harding and Gillooly having sex from the same extended videotape. This 35-minute sex tape would also be copied and marketed exclusively by \"Penthouse\". Both Gillooly and Harding used the same agent to negotiate equal payment on the \"Penthouse\" sale.\nIn 1994, Harding was cast in \"Breakaway\", an action film, alongside Teri Fruichantie and Joseph \"Joe\" Est\u00e9vez. The plot centered on Harding being unwittingly involved in an organized crime syndicate's attempt to violently recover $300,000 of stolen money. The film was released in 1996.\nHarding has also appeared on television, on the game show \"The Weakest Link\": \"15 Minutes of Fame Edition\" in 2002 along with Kato Kaelin,\nand in March 2008, became a commentator for TruTV's \"\".\nSince leaving skating and boxing, Harding has worked as a welder, a painter at a metal fabrication company, and a hardware sales clerk at Sears. In 2017, she stated that she worked as a painter and deck builder. She lives in Vancouver, Washington.\nIn August 2019, Harding was seen in a television commercial in the United States promoting Direct Auto Insurance.\nBoxing career.\nIn 2002, Harding boxed against Paula Jones on the Fox Network \"Celebrity Boxing\" event, winning the fight. On February 22, 2003, she made her official women's professional boxing debut, losing a four-round split decision against Samantha Browning on the undercard of Mike Tyson vs. Clifford Etienne. Harding's boxing career came about amid rumors that she was having financial difficulties, and needed to fight in the ring to earn money. She did another celebrity boxing match, on \"The Man Show\", and won against co-host Doug Stanhope. Stanhope later claimed on his podcast that the fight was fixed because Harding refused to \"fight a man.\"\nOn March 23, 2004, it was reported that she cancelled a planned boxing match against Tracy Carlton in Oakland, California, because of an alleged death threat against her.\nOn June 24, 2004, she was defeated by Amy Johnson in a match held in Edmonton, Alberta. Fans reportedly booed Harding as she entered the ring, and cheered wildly for Johnson when she won in the third round.\nHer boxing career was cut short by her asthma. Her overall record was three wins and three losses.\nOther appearances.\nAutomobile racing land speed record.\nOn August 12, 2009, Harding set a new land speed record for a vintage gas coupe with a speed of driving a 1931 Ford Model A, named \"Lickity-Split\", on the Bonneville Salt Flats.\n\"Dancing with the Stars\".\nOn April 13, 2018, Harding was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete on season 26 of \"Dancing with the Stars\". Her professional partner was Sasha Farber. Harding and Farber ended up finishing in third place.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Worst Cooks in America\".\nIn August 2018, Harding was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete in the fifth celebrity edition of Food Network's \"Worst Cooks in America\", set to broadcast in April 2019. Harding, learning under Chef Anne Burrell, ultimately won the competition. The US$25,000 prize went to her chosen charity of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\nPersonal life.\nHarding is the only child of Albert Gordon Harding and LaVona Golden, who had been married three times before and had four other children. The two divorced in 1987. Harding had a tumultuous relationship with her mother, alleging both physical and emotional abuse. She cites one occasion where her mother threw a knife at her. LaVona responded that such an incident never occurred, and said her daughter has a history of dishonesty.\nHarding began a relationship with 17-year-old Jeff Gillooly in September 1986 when she was 15. They moved into a home together in 1988 when he worked in distribution at the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. They married on March 18, 1990, when she was 19 and he was 22. In January 1992, Harding told Terry Richard of \"The Oregonian\", \"Jeff always put food on the table and a roof over my head. He paid for my skating for a couple of years. If it hadn't been for him during that time, I wouldn't have been skating.\" They divorced on August 28, 1993. During the autumn of 1993, Gillooly was working part-time managing Harding's career and taking real estate classes. Harding and Gillooly had been continuing to see each other since early October 1993, and were sharing a rented chalet in Beavercreek, Oregon until January 18, 1994.\nHarding married Michael Smith in 1995; they divorced in 1996. On October 29, 1996, Harding received media attention after using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to help revive an 81-year-old woman who collapsed at a bar in Portland while playing video poker.\nOn February 22, 2000, Harding attacked her then-boyfriend, Darren Silver, repeatedly punching him in the face and throwing a hubcap at his head. The attack left Silver with a bloodied face and Harding was arrested. She initially pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges; but in a May trial in Clark County District Court, Harding admitted to attacking Silver, and was sentenced to three days in jail, 10 days of community service, and a suspended jail sentence of 167 days.\nShe married 42-year-old Joseph Price on June 23, 2010, when she was 39 years old. She gave birth to a son named Gordon on February 19, 2011.\nOn February 26, 2018, Harding stated on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" that she is still active in skating and practices three times a week. She performed several jumps and spins on the show. She trains with her former coach, Dody Teachman.\nCultural effects.\nHarding's life, career, and role in the 1994 attack have been widely referenced in popular culture, including a 2007 primary campaign speech by then-Democratic Presidential nominee Barack Obama, in which he said, \"Folks said there's no way Obama has a chance unless he goes and kneecaps the person ahead of us, does a Tonya Harding.\" In 2014, Matt Harkins and Viviana Olen created the Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding Museum in their Brooklyn apartment, collecting and archiving memorabilia related to Nancy Kerrigan and Harding. A contemporaneous \"Vogue\" article noted that Harding had developed a \"cult following\" through the years.\nAcademic assessment.\nIn 1995, the book \"Women on Ice: Feminist Essays on the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan Spectacle\" was published, containing numerous essays analyzing Harding's public image. For example, Abigail Feder wrote that there existed \"overdetermined femininity in Ladies' Figure Skating...femininity and athleticism are mutually exclusive concepts in American culture.\" Sam Stoloff wrote that, during the scandal, the media placed more emphasis on Harding's class than her gender. He noted how she was subjected to a \"litany of vaguely pejorative or mocking expressions\" associated with \"low class\" cultural attributes, sometimes due to Harding's personal interests and hobbies. Stoloff theorized that Harding represented an American social class that required interpretation (\"the class Other\") as he referenced the anthropological tone of Susan Orlean's 1994 essay \"Figures in a Mall\", written for \"The New Yorker\".\nIn writer Sarah Marshall's 2014 essay entitled \"Remote Control: Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and the Spectacles of Female Power and Pain\", she noted the pervasive role of the media in the 1994 scandal: \"Somehow, in the scandal's aftermath, the form of the Tonya-bash was able to alchemize even the most chilling details of Tonya's life into tabloid gold.\" Marshall also examined the role of Harding's \"tomboy\" persona in the context of figure skating. She theorized that Harding was rejected by the figure skating ethos because she did not conform \u2013 as Marshall believed many figure skaters, including Nancy Kerrigan, did \u2013 to appearing as \"beautiful without being sexual, strong without being intimidating, and vulnerable without being weak.\"\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48113", "revid": "39049151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48113", "title": "SWIFT", "text": "Financial telecommunication network\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), legally S.W.I.F.T. SC, is a cooperative established in 1973 in Belgium () and owned by the banks and other member firms that use its service. SWIFT provides the main messaging network through which international payments are initiated. It also sells software and services to financial institutions, mostly for use on its proprietary \"SWIFTNet\", and assigns ISO 9362 Business Identifier Codes (BICs), popularly known as \"SWIFT codes\". On 22nd November 2025 SWIFT said goodbye to message format, moved ISO 20022 to Blockchain\nAs of 2018, around half of all high-value cross-border payments worldwide used the SWIFT network, and in 2015, SWIFT linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories, who were exchanging an average of over 32\u00a0million messages per day (compared to an average of 2.4\u00a0million daily messages in 1995).\nSWIFT is headquartered in La Hulpe near Brussels. It hosts an annual conference, called Sibos, specifically aimed at the financial services industry.\nHistory.\nBefore SWIFT's establishment, international financial transactions were communicated over Telex, a public system involving manual writing and reading of messages. SWIFT was set up out of fear of what might happen if a single private and fully American entity controlled global financial flows \u2013 which before was First National City Bank (FNCB) of New York \u2013 later Citibank. In response to FNCB's protocol, FNCB's competitors in the US and Europe pushed an alternative \"messaging system that could replace the public providers and speed up the payment process\".\nSWIFT was founded in Brussels on 3 May 1973. Individuals who played a key role in its creation included bankers Jan Kraa (at AMRO Bank) and Fran\u00e7ois Dentz (at the Banque de l'Union Parisienne) as well as Carl Reuterski\u00f6ld and Bessel Kok, who became respectively its first two chairmen and chief executives.14-16 It was initially supported by 239 banks in 15 countries. It soon started to establish common standards for financial transactions and a shared data processing system and worldwide communications network designed by Logica and developed by the Burroughs Corporation. Fundamental operating procedures and rules for liability were established in 1975, and the first message was ceremonially sent by Prince Albert of Belgium on none }}.19\nSWIFT's first non-European operations centre was inaugurated by Governor John N. Dalton of Virginia in 1979. In 1989 SWIFT completed a monumental new head office building in La Hulpe, designed by Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura.\nOwnership and governance.\nSWIFT's shareholding structure is adjusted every three years in proportion to volumes of activity incurred by the members, ensuring that the most active members get the most voice irrespective of geography; additional rules are aimed at ensuring some geographical diversity within the board of directors. The 25 directors are elected by the shareholders, on three-year terms with the renewal of one-third of the board every year; all directors are member representatives.30-31\nAs of May 2024, the members directly represented on the board of directors were JPMorgan Chase (chair), Lloyds Bank (deputy chair), Bank of China, BNP Paribas, BPCE, Citi, Clearstream, Commerzbank, Commonwealth Bank, Deutsche Bank, Euroclear, FirstRand, HSBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, KBC, MUFG, NatWest, Nordea, Royal Bank of Canada, Santander, SEB, UBS (2 representatives following the acquisition of Credit Suisse), as well as the Association of Banks in Singapore.\nOperations.\nSWIFT acts as a carrier of the \"messages containing the payment instructions between financial institutions involved in a transaction\".35 However, the organisation does not manage accounts on behalf of individuals or financial institutions, and it does not hold funds from third parties.1-2 It also does not perform clearing or settlement functions.1-2, 35 After payment has been initiated, it must be settled through a payment system, such as T2 in Europe.36 In the context of cross-border transactions, this step often takes place through correspondent banking accounts that financial institutions have with each other.35\nSWIFT means several things in the financial world: \nUnder 3 above, SWIFT provides turn-key solutions for members, consisting of linkage clients to facilitate connectivity to the SWIFT network and CBTs or \"computer-based terminals\" which members use to manage the delivery and receipt of their messages. Some of the more well-known interfaces and CBTs provided to their members are:\nServices.\nThere are four key areas that SWIFT services fall under in the financial marketplace: securities, treasury &amp; derivatives, trade services, and payments &amp; cash management.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSWIFT Ref, the global payment reference data utility, is SWIFT's unique reference data service. SWIFT Ref sources data directly from data originators, including central banks, code issuers and banks making it easy for issuers and originators to maintain data regularly and thoroughly. SWIFTRef constantly validates and cross-checks data across the different data sets.\nOperations centres.\nThe SWIFT secure messaging network is run from three data centres, located in the United States, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. These centres share information in near real-time. In case of a failure in one of the data centres, another is able to handle the traffic of the complete network. SWIFT uses submarine communications cables to transmit its data.\nShortly after opening its third data centre in Switzerland in 2009, SWIFT introduced a new distributed architecture with two messaging zones, European and Trans-Atlantic, so data from European SWIFT members no longer mirrored the US data centre. European zone messages are stored in the Netherlands and in part of the Swiss operating centre; Trans-Atlantic zone messages are stored in the United States and in another part of the Swiss operating centre that is segregated from the European zone messages. Countries outside of Europe were by default allocated to the Trans-Atlantic zone but could choose to have their messages stored in the European zone.\nSWIFTNet network.\nSWIFT moved to its current IP network infrastructure, known as SWIFTNet, from 2001 to 2005, providing a total replacement of the previous X.25 infrastructure. The process involved the development of new protocols that facilitate efficient messaging, using existing and new message standards. The adopted technology chosen to develop the protocols was XML, which now provides a wrapper around all messages legacy or contemporary. The communication protocols can be broken down into:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSWIFT provides a centralized store-and-forward mechanism, with some transaction management. For bank A to send a message to bank B with a copy or authorization involving institution C, it formats the message according to standards and securely sends it to SWIFT. SWIFT guarantees its secure and reliable delivery to B after the appropriate action by C. SWIFT guarantees are based primarily on high redundancy of hardware, software, and people.\nDuring 2007 and 2008, the entire SWIFT network migrated its infrastructure to a new protocol called SWIFTNet Phase 2. The main difference between Phase 2 and the former arrangement is that Phase 2 requires banks connecting to the network to use a Relationship Management Application (RMA) instead of the former bilateral key exchange (BKE) system. According to SWIFT's public information database on the subject, RMA software should eventually prove more secure and easier to keep up-to-date; however, converting to the RMA system meant that thousands of banks around the world had to update their international payment systems to comply with the new standards. RMA completely replaced BKE on 1 January 2009.\nStandards.\nSWIFT has become the industry standard for syntax in financial messages. Messages formatted to SWIFT standards can be read and processed by many well-known financial processing systems, whether or not the message travelled over the SWIFT network. SWIFT cooperates with international organizations to define standards for message format and content. SWIFT is also a \"registration authority\" (RA) for the following ISO standards:\nIn RFC 3615 \"urn:swift:\" was defined as Uniform Resource Names (URNs) for SWIFT FIN.\nSupervision.\nSWIFT is not a payment system and thus neither regulated nor supervised as such, but is nevertheless deemed to be systemically important and thus under the \"oversight\" of public authorities. In 1998, the so-called Group of Ten central banks (those of Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the US and the European Central Bank) started acting as joint overseers, with the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) in a lead role. The oversight focuses primarily on systemic risk, confidentiality, infrastructure security, and business continuity.43 It is formalized in bilateral documents between the NBB and SWIFT on the one hand, and between the NBB and each of the other G10 central banks on the other hand. In 2018, the International Monetary Fund has recommended that \"the National Bank of Belgium should consider enhancing oversight with additional regulatory and supervisory powers.\"\nIn 2012, this framework was complemented by a \"SWIFT Oversight Forum\" including additional central banks. As of 2024, in addition to the G10 central banks, the SWIFT Oversight Forum included the national central banks of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, and Turkey. According to SWIFT, the Oversight Forum \"provides a forum for the G-10 central banks to share information on SWIFT oversight activities with a wider group of central banks.\"\nControversy.\nInefficiency.\nSWIFT has been criticised for inefficiency. In 2018, the London-based \"Financial Times\" noted that transfers frequently \"pass through multiple banks before reaching their final destination, making them time-consuming, costly and lacking transparency on how much money will arrive at the other end\". SWIFT has since introduced an improved service called \"Global Payments Innovation\" (GPI), claiming it was adopted by 165 banks and was completing half its payments within 30 minutes. The new standard which included SWIFT Go was supposed to be utilised in receiving and transferring low-value international payments. One of the significant changes was the transaction amount, which would not differ from start to end. However, as of 2023[ [update]], uptake was mixed. For instance, Alisherov Eraj, Alif Bank Treasury Department SWIFT Transfers &amp; Banking Relationship Expert in the Republic of Tajikistan, describes that the leading cause for the late SWIFT Go adoption in Tajikistan was the Core Banking System itself. To connect to SWIFT Go, he adds, banking system interfaces needed to be upgraded and integrated with their software to be fully compatible; this hindered many banks from adopting the technology earlier.\nUS government surveillance.\nA series of articles published on 23 June 2006 in \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and the \"Los Angeles Times\" revealed a program, named the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, which the US Treasury Department, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and other United States governmental agencies initiated after the 11 September attacks to gain access to the SWIFT transaction database.\nAfter the publication of these articles, SWIFT quickly came under pressure for compromising the data privacy of its customers by allowing governments to gain access to sensitive personal information. In September 2006, the Belgian government declared that these SWIFT dealings with American governmental authorities were a breach of Belgian and European privacy laws.\nIn response, and to satisfy members' concerns about privacy, SWIFT began a process of improving its architecture by implementing a distributed architecture with a two-zone model for storing messages &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nConcurrently, the European Union negotiated an agreement with the United States government to permit the transfer of intra-EU SWIFT transaction information to the United States under certain circumstances. Because of concerns about its potential contents, the European Parliament adopted a position statement in September 2009, demanding to see the full text of the agreement and asking that it be fully compliant with EU privacy legislation, with oversight mechanisms emplaced to ensure that all data requests were handled appropriately. An interim agreement was signed without European Parliamentary approval by the European Council on 30 November 2009, the day before the Lisbon Treaty\u2014which would have prohibited such an agreement from being signed under the terms of the codecision procedure\u2014formally came into effect. While the interim agreement was scheduled to come into effect on 1 January 2010, the text of the agreement was classified as \"EU Restricted\" until translations could be provided in all EU languages and published on 25 January 2010.\nOn 11 February 2010, the European Parliament decided to reject the interim agreement between the EU and the US by 378 to 196 votes. One week earlier, the parliament's civil liberties committee had already rejected the deal, citing legal reservations.\nIn March 2011, it was reported that two mechanisms of data protection had failed: EUROPOL released a report complaining that requests for information from the US had been too vague (making it impossible to make judgments on validity) and that the guaranteed right for European citizens to know whether their information had been accessed by US authorities had not been put into practice.\n\"Der Spiegel\" reported in September 2013 that the National Security Agency (NSA) widely monitors banking transactions via SWIFT, as well as credit card transactions. The NSA intercepted and retained data from the SWIFT network used by thousands of banks to securely send transaction information. SWIFT was named as a \"target\", according to documents leaked by Edward Snowden. The documents revealed that the NSA spied on SWIFT using a variety of methods, including reading \"SWIFT printer traffic from numerous banks\". In April 2017, a group known as the Shadow Brokers released files allegedly from the NSA which indicate that the agency monitored financial transactions made through SWIFT.\nSWIFT and sanctions.\nIran.\nIn January 2012, the advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) implemented a campaign calling on SWIFT to end all relations with Iran's banking system, including the Central Bank of Iran. UANI asserted that Iran's membership in SWIFT violated US and EU financial sanctions against Iran as well as SWIFT's own corporate rules.\nConsequently, in February 2012, the US Senate Banking Committee unanimously approved sanctions against SWIFT aimed at pressuring it to terminate its ties with blacklisted Iranian banks. Expelling Iranian banks from SWIFT would potentially deny Iran access to billions of dollars in revenue using SWIFT but not from using IVTS. Mark Wallace, president of UANI, praised the Senate Banking Committee.\nInitially SWIFT denied that it was acting illegally, but later said that \"it is working with U.S. and European governments to address their concerns that its financial services are being used by Iran to avoid sanctions and conduct illicit business\". Targeted banks would be\u2014amongst others\u2014Saderat Bank of Iran, Bank Mellat, Post Bank of Iran and Sepah Bank. On 17 March 2012, following an agreement two days earlier between all 27 member states of the Council of the European Union and the council's subsequent ruling, SWIFT disconnected all Iranian banks that had been identified as institutions in breach of current EU sanctions from its international network and warned that even more Iranian financial institutions could be disconnected from the network.\nIn February 2016, most Iranian banks reconnected to the network following the lift of sanctions due to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. \nIn November 2024, Iran implemented a paradigm shift approach to shift the focus from the SWIFT payment system by initiating the concept of bringing ACUMER. ACUMER was coined by Iran as a retaliation to the international sanctions imposed by the United States which has ever since limited Iran's competitive edge in the context of international trade. Iran had long conceived an idea of bringing a viable alternative option to SWIFT in order to actively engage in smooth economic activities and international trade.\nIsrael.\nIn 2014, SWIFT rejected calls from pro-Palestinian activists to revoke Israeli banks' access to its network owing to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.\nRussia and Belarus.\nSimilarly, in August 2014 the UK planned to press the EU to block Russian use of SWIFT as a sanction due to Russian military intervention in Ukraine. However, SWIFT refused to do so. SPFS, a Russian alternative to SWIFT, was developed by the Central Bank of Russia as a backup measure.\nDuring the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States developed preliminary possible sanctions against Russia, but excluded banning Russia from SWIFT. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the foreign ministers of the Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia called for Russia to be cut off from SWIFT. However, other EU member states were reluctant, both because European lenders held most of the nearly $30 billion in foreign banks' exposure to Russia and because Russia had developed the SPFS alternative. The European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States finally agreed to remove a few Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine; the governments of France, Germany, Italy and Japan individually released statements alongside the EU.\nOn 20 March 2023, Russia was banned from SWIFT.\nThe European Union issued the first set of sanctions against Belarus; the first was introduced on 27 February 2022, which banned certain categories of Belarusian items in the EU, including timber, steel, mineral fuels and tobacco. After the Lithuanian prime minister proposed disconnecting Belarus from SWIFT, the European Union, which does not recognise Lukashenko as the legitimate President of Belarus, started to plan an extension of the sanctions already issued against Russian entities and top officials to its ally.\nSecurity.\nIn 2016 an $81\u00a0million theft from the Bangladesh central bank via its account at the New York Federal Reserve Bank was traced to hacker penetration of SWIFT's Alliance Access software, according to a \"New York Times\" report. It was not the first such attempt, the society acknowledged, and the security of the transfer system was undergoing new examination accordingly. Soon after the reports of the theft from the Bangladesh central bank, a second, apparently related, attack was reported to have occurred at a commercial bank in Vietnam.\nBoth attacks involved malware written both to issue unauthorized SWIFT messages and to conceal that the messages had been sent. After the malware sent the SWIFT messages that stole the funds, it deleted the database record of the transfers and then took further steps to prevent confirmation messages from revealing the theft. In the Bangladeshi case, the confirmation messages would have appeared on a paper report; the malware altered the paper reports when they were sent to the printer. In the second case, the bank used a PDF report; the malware altered the PDF viewer to hide the transfers.\nIn May 2016, Banco del Austro (BDA) in Ecuador sued Wells Fargo after Wells Fargo honoured $12\u00a0million in fund transfer requests that had been placed by thieves. In this case, the thieves sent SWIFT messages that resembled recently cancelled transfer requests from BDA, with slightly altered amounts; the reports do not detail how the thieves gained access to send the SWIFT messages. BDA asserts that Wells Fargo should have detected the suspicious SWIFT messages, which were placed outside of normal BDA working hours and were of an unusual size. Wells Fargo claims that BDA is responsible for the loss, as the thieves gained access to the legitimate SWIFT credentials of a BDA employee and sent fully authenticated SWIFT messages.\nIn the first half of 2016, an anonymous Ukrainian bank and others\u2014even \"dozens\" that are not being made public\u2014were variously reported to have been \"compromised\" through the SWIFT network and to have lost money.\nIn March 2022, Swiss newspaper \"Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung\" reported about the increased security precautions by the State Police of Thurgau at the SWIFT data centre in Diessenhofen. After most of the Russian banks had been excluded from the private payment system, the risk of sabotage was considered higher. Inhabitants of the town described the large complex as a \"fortress\" or \"prison\" where frequent security checks of the fenced property are conducted.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although conventionally referred to as the , the combination of praenomen, nomen, and cognomen that have come to be regarded as the basic elements of the Roman name in fact represent a continuous process of development, from at least the seventh century BC to the end of the seventh century AD. The names that developed as part of this system became a defining characteristic of Roman civilization, and although the system itself vanished during the Early Middle Ages, the names themselves exerted a profound influence on the development of European naming practices, and many continue to survive in modern languages.\nOverview.\nThe distinguishing feature of Roman nomenclature was the use of both personal names and regular surnames. Throughout Europe and the Mediterranean, other ancient civilizations distinguished individuals using single personal names. These names usually combined two elements or themes which allowed for hundreds or even thousands of possible combinations\u2014a dithematic naming system. But a markedly different system of nomenclature arose in Italy, where the personal name was joined by a hereditary surname. Over time, this binomial system expanded to include additional names and designations.\nThe most important of these names was the \"nomen gentilicium\", or simply \"nomen\", a hereditary surname that identified a person as a member of a distinct gens. This was preceded by the praenomen, or \"forename\", a personal name that served to distinguish between the different members of a family. For example, a Roman named \"Publius Lemonius\" might have sons named \"Publius Lemonius\", \"Lucius Lemonius\", and \"Gaius Lemonius\". Here, \"Lemonius\" is the \"nomen\", identifying each person in the family as a member of the gens Lemonia; \"Publius\", \"Lucius\", and \"Gaius\" are praenomina used to distinguish between them.\nThe origin of this binomial system is lost in prehistory, but it appears to have been established in Latium and Etruria by at least 650 BC. In written form, the \"nomen\" was usually followed by a filiation, indicating the personal name of an individual's father, and sometimes the name of the mother or other antecedents. Toward the end of the Roman Republic, this was followed by the name of a citizen's voting tribe. Lastly, these elements could be followed by additional surnames, or cognomina, which could be either personal or hereditary, or a combination of both.\nThe Roman grammarians came to regard the combination of praenomen, nomen, and cognomen as a defining characteristic of Roman citizenship, known as the \"tria nomina\". However, although all three elements of the Roman name existed throughout most of Roman history, the concept of the \"tria nomina\" can be misleading, because not all of these names were required or used throughout the whole of Roman history. During the period of the Roman Republic, the praenomen and nomen represented the essential elements of the name; the cognomen first appeared among the Roman aristocracy at the inception of the Republic, but was not widely used among the plebeians, who made up the majority of the Roman people, until the second century BC. Even then, not all Roman citizens bore cognomina, and until the end of the Republic the cognomen was regarded as somewhat less than an official name. By contrast, in imperial times the cognomen became the principal distinguishing element of the Roman name, and although praenomina never completely vanished, the essential elements of the Roman name from the second century onward were the nomen and cognomen.\nNaming conventions for women also varied from the classical concept of the \"tria nomina\". Originally Roman women shared the binomial nomenclature of men; but over time the praenomen became less useful as a distinguishing element, and women's praenomina were gradually discarded, or replaced by informal names. By the end of the Republic, the majority of Roman women either did not have or did not use praenomina. Most women were called by their nomen alone, or by a combination of nomen and cognomen. Praenomina could still be given when necessary, and as with men's praenomina the practice survived well into imperial times, but the proliferation of personal cognomina eventually rendered women's praenomina obsolete.\nIn the later empire, members of the Roman aristocracy used several different schemes of assuming and inheriting nomina and cognomina, both to signify their rank, and to indicate their family and social connections. Some Romans came to be known by alternative names, or \"signa\", and due to the lack of surviving epigraphic evidence, the full nomenclature of most Romans, even among the aristocracy, is seldom recorded.\nThus, although the three types of names referred to as the \"tria nomina\" existed throughout Roman history, the period during which the majority of citizens possessed exactly three names was relatively brief. Nevertheless, because most of the important individuals during the best-recorded periods of Roman history possessed all three names, the \"tria nomina\" remains the most familiar conception of the Roman name.\nFor a variety of reasons, the Roman nomenclature system broke down in the centuries following the collapse of imperial authority in the west. The praenomen had already become scarce in written sources during the fourth century, and by the fifth century it was retained only by the most conservative elements of the old Roman aristocracy, such as the Aurelii Symmachi. Over the course of the sixth century, as Roman institutions and social structures gradually fell away, the need to distinguish between nomina and cognomina likewise vanished. By the end of the seventh century, the people of Italy and western Europe had reverted to single names. But many of the names that had originated as part of the \"tria nomina\" were adapted to this usage, and survived into modern times.\nOrigin and development.\nAs in other cultures, the early peoples of Italy probably used a single name, which later developed into the praenomen. Marcus Terentius Varro wrote that the earliest Italians used simple names. Names of this type could be honorific or aspirational, or might refer to deities, physical peculiarities, or circumstances of birth. In this early period, the number of personal names must have been quite large; however, with the development of additional names, the number in widespread use dwindled. By the early Republic, about three dozen Latin praenomina remained in use, some of which were already rare; about eighteen were used by the patricians. Barely a dozen praenomina remained in general use under the Empire, although aristocratic families sometimes revived older praenomina, or created new ones from cognomina.\nThe development of the nomen as the second element of the Italic name cannot be attributed to a specific period or culture. From the earliest period it was common to both the Indo-European speaking Italic peoples and the Etruscans. The historian Livy relates the adoption of \"Silvius\" as a nomen by the kings of Alba Longa in honour of their ancestor, Silvius. As part of Rome's foundation myth, this statement cannot be regarded as historical fact, but it does indicate the antiquity of the period to which the Romans themselves ascribed the adoption of hereditary surnames.\nIn Latin, most nomina were formed by adding an adjectival suffix, usually \"-ius\", to the stem of an existing word or name. Frequently, this required a joining element, such as \"-e-, -id-, -il-\", or \"-on-\". Many common nomina arose as patronymic surnames; for instance, the nomen \"Marcius\" was derived from the praenomen \"Marcus\", and originally signified \"Marci filius\", \"son of Marcus\". In the same way, \"Sextius\", \"Publilius\", and \"Lucilius\" arose from the praenomina \"Sextus\", \"Publius\", and \"Lucius\". This demonstrates that, much like later European surnames, the earliest nomina were not necessarily hereditary, but might be adopted and discarded at will, and changed from one generation to the next. The practice from which these patronymics arose also gave rise to the filiation, which in later times, once the nomen had become fixed, nearly always followed the nomen. Other nomina were derived from names that later came to be regarded as cognomina, such as \"Plancius\" from \"Plancus\" or \"Flavius\" from \"Flavus\"; or from place-names, such as \"Norbanus\" from \"Norba\".\nThe binomial name consisting of \"praenomen\" and \"nomen\" eventually spread throughout Italy. Nomina from different languages and regions often have distinctive characteristics; Latin nomina tended to end in \"-ius, -us, -aius, -eius, -eus\", or \"-aeus\", while Oscan names frequently ended in \"-is\" or \"-iis\"; Umbrian names in \"-as, -anas, -enas\", or \"-inas\", and Etruscan names in \"-arna, -erna, -ena, -enna, -ina\", or \"-inna\". Oscan and Umbrian forms tend to be found in inscriptions; in Roman literature these names are often Latinized.\nMany individuals added an additional surname, or \"cognomen\", which helped to distinguish between members of larger families. Originally these were simply personal names, which might be derived from a person's physical features, personal qualities, occupation, place of origin, or even an object with which a person was associated. Some cognomina were derived from the circumstance of a person's adoption from one family into another, or were derived from foreign names, such as when a freedman received a Roman praenomen and nomen. Other cognomina commemorated important events associated with a person; a battle in which a man had fought (Regillensis), a town captured (Coriolanus); or a miraculous occurrence (Corvus). The late grammarians distinguished certain cognomina as \"agnomina\".\nAlthough originally a personal name, the cognomen frequently became hereditary, especially in large families, or \"gentes\", in which they served to identify distinct branches, known as \"stirpes\". Some Romans had more than one cognomen, and in aristocratic families, it was not unheard of for individuals to have as many as three, of which some might be hereditary and some personal. These surnames were initially characteristic of patrician families, but over time, cognomina were also acquired by the plebeians. However, a number of distinguished plebeian gentes, such as the Antonii and the Marii, were never divided into different branches, and in these families cognomina were the exception rather than the rule.\nCognomina are known from the beginning of the Republic, but were long regarded as informal names, and omitted from most official records before the second century BC. Later inscriptions commemorating the early centuries of the Republic supply these missing surnames, although the authenticity of some of them has been disputed. Under the Empire, however, the cognomen acquired great importance, and the number of cognomina assumed by the Roman aristocracy multiplied exponentially.\nAdding to the complexity of aristocratic names was the practice of combining the full nomenclature of both one's paternal and maternal ancestors, resulting in some individuals appearing to have two or more complete names. Duplicative or politically undesirable names might be omitted, while the order of names might be rearranged to emphasize those giving the bearer the greatest prestige.\nFollowing the promulgation of the \"Constitutio Antoniniana\" in AD 212, granting Roman citizenship to all free men living within the Roman Empire, the praenomen and nomen lost much of their distinguishing function, as all of the newly enfranchised citizens shared the name of \"Marcus Aurelius\". The praenomen and sometimes the nomen gradually disappeared from view, crowded out by other names indicating the bearer's rank and social connections. Surviving inscriptions from the fifth century rarely provide a citizen's full nomenclature.\nIn the final centuries of the Empire, the traditional nomenclature was sometimes replaced by alternate names, known as \"signa\". In the course of the sixth century, as central authority collapsed and Roman institutions disappeared, the complex forms of Roman nomenclature were abandoned altogether, and the people of Italy and western Europe reverted to single names. Modern European nomenclature developed independently of the Roman model during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. However, many modern names are derived from Roman originals.\n\"Tria nomina\".\nThe three types of names that have come to be regarded as quintessentially Roman were the \"praenomen, nomen\", and \"cognomen\". Together, these were referred to as the \"tria nomina\". Although not all Romans possessed three names, the practice of using multiple names having different functions was a defining characteristic of Roman culture that distinguished citizens from foreigners.\nPraenomen.\nThe praenomen was a true personal name, chosen by a child's parents, and bestowed on the \"dies lustricus\", or \"day of lustration\", a ritual purification performed on the eighth day after the birth of a girl, or the ninth day after the birth of a boy. Normally all of the children in a family would have different praenomina. Although there was no law restricting the use of specific praenomina, the choice of the parents was usually governed by custom and family tradition. An eldest son was usually named after his father, and younger sons were named after their father's brothers or other male ancestors. In this way, the same praenomina were passed down in a family from one generation to the next. Not only did this serve to emphasize the continuity of a family across many generations, but the selection of praenomina also distinguished the customs of one gens from another. The patrician gentes in particular tended to limit the number of praenomina that they used far more than the plebeians, which was a way of reinforcing the exclusiveness of their social status.\nOf course, there were many exceptions to these general practices. A son might be named in honour of one of his maternal relatives, thus bringing a new name into the gens. Because some gentes made regular use of only three or four praenomina, new names might appear whenever a family had more than three or four sons. Furthermore, a number of the oldest and most influential patrician families made a habit of choosing unusual names; in particular the Fabii, Aemilii, Furii, Claudii, Cornelii, and Valerii all used praenomina that were uncommon amongst the patricians, or which had fallen out of general use. In the last two centuries of the Republic, and under the early Empire, it was fashionable for aristocratic families to revive older praenomina.\nAbout three dozen Latin praenomina were in use at the beginning of the Republic, although only about eighteen were common. This number fell gradually, until by the first century AD, about a dozen praenomina remained in widespread use, with a handful of others used by particular families. The origin and use of praenomina was a matter of curiosity to the Romans themselves; in \"De Praenominibus\", Probus discusses a number of older praenomina and their meanings. Most praenomina were regularly abbreviated, and rarely written in full. Other praenomina were used by the Oscan, Umbrian, and Etruscan-speaking peoples of Italy, and many of these also had regular abbreviations. (Lists of praenomina used by the various people of Italy, together with their usual abbreviations, can be found at praenomen.)\nRoman men were usually known by their praenomina to members of their family and household, \"clientes\" and close friends; but outside of this circle, they might be called by their nomen, cognomen, or any combination of praenomen, nomen, and cognomen that was sufficient to distinguish them from other men with similar names. In the literature of the Republic, and on all formal occasions, such as when a senator was called upon to speak, it was customary to address a citizen by praenomen and nomen; or, if this were insufficient to distinguish him from other members of the gens, by praenomen and cognomen.\nIn imperial times, the praenomen became increasingly confused by the practices of the aristocracy. The emperors usually prefixed \"Imperator\" to their names as a praenomen, while at the same time retaining their own praenomina; but because most of the early emperors were legally adopted by their predecessors, and formally assumed new names, even these were subject to change. Several members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty exchanged their original praenomina for cognomina, or received cognomina in place of praenomina at birth. An emperor might emancipate or enfranchise large groups of people at once, all of whom would automatically receive the emperor's praenomen and nomen. Yet another common practice beginning in the first century AD was to give multiple sons the same praenomen, and distinguish them using different cognomina; by the second century this was becoming the rule, rather than the exception. Another confusing practice was the addition of the full nomenclature of maternal ancestors to the basic \"tria nomina\", so that a man might appear to have two praenomina, one occurring in the middle of his name.\nUnder the weight of these practices and others, the utility of the praenomen to distinguish between men continued to decline, until only the force of tradition prevented its utter abandonment. Over the course of the third century, praenomina become increasingly scarce in written records, and from the fourth century onward their appearance becomes exceptional. The descendants of those who had been granted citizenship by the \"Constitutio Antoniniana\" seem to have dispensed with praenomina altogether, and by the end of the western empire, only the oldest Roman families continued to use them.\nNomen.\nThe \"nomen gentilicium\", or \"gentile name\", designated a Roman citizen as a member of a gens. A gens, which may be translated as \"clan\", constituted an extended Roman group of individuals, all of whom shared the same nomen and claimed descent from a common ancestor. Particularly in the early Republic, the gens functioned as a state within the state, observing its own sacred rites and establishing private laws, which were binding on its members, although not on the community as a whole.\nCognomen.\nThe cognomen, the third element of the \"tria nomina\", began as an additional personal name. It was not unique to Rome, but Rome was where the cognomen flourished, as the development of the gens and the gradual decline of the praenomen as a useful means of distinguishing between individuals made the cognomen a useful means of identifying both individuals and whole branches of Rome's leading families. In the early years of the Republic, some aristocratic Romans had as many as three cognomina, some of which were hereditary, while others were personal.\nLike the nomen, cognomina could arise from any number of factors: personal characteristics, habits, occupations, places of origin, heroic exploits, and so forth. One class of cognomina consisted largely of archaic praenomina that were seldom used by the later Republic, although as cognomina these names persisted throughout Imperial times. Many cognomina had unusual terminations for Latin names, ending in \"-a, -o\", or \"-io\", and their meanings were frequently obscure, even in antiquity; this seems to emphasize the manner in which many cognomina originally arose from nicknames. The \"-ius\" termination typical of Latin nomina was generally not used for cognomina until the fourth century AD, making it easier to distinguish between nomina and cognomina until the final centuries of the western empire.\nUnlike the nomen, which was passed down unchanged from father to son, cognomina could appear and disappear almost at will. They were not normally chosen by the persons who bore them, but were earned or bestowed by others, which may account for the wide variety of unflattering names that were used as cognomina. Doubtless some cognomina were used ironically, while others continued in use largely because, whatever their origin, they were useful for distinguishing among individuals and between branches of large families. New cognomina were coined and came into fashion throughout Roman history.\nUnder the Empire, the number of cognomina increased dramatically. Where once only the most noble patrician houses used multiple surnames, Romans of all backgrounds and social standing might bear several cognomina. By the third century, this had become the norm amongst freeborn Roman citizens. The question of how to classify different cognomina led the grammarians of the fourth and fifth centuries to designate some of them as \"agnomina\".\nFor most of the Republic, the usual manner of distinguishing individuals was through the binomial form of praenomen and nomen. But as the praenomen lost its value as a distinguishing name, and gradually faded into obscurity, its former role was assumed by the versatile cognomen, and the typical manner of identifying individuals came to be by nomen and cognomen; essentially one form of binomial nomenclature was replaced by another, over the course of several centuries. The very lack of regularity that allowed the cognomen to be used as either a personal or a hereditary surname became its strength in imperial times; as a hereditary surname, a cognomen could be used to identify an individual's connection with other noble families, either by descent, or later by association. Individual cognomina could also be used to distinguish between members of the same family; even as siblings came to share the same praenomen, they bore different cognomina, some from the paternal line, and others from their maternal ancestors.\nAlthough the nomen was a required element of Roman nomenclature down to the end of the western empire, its usefulness as a distinguishing name declined throughout imperial times, as an increasingly large portion of the population bore nomina such as \"Flavius\" or \"Aurelius\", which had been granted \"en masse\" to newly enfranchised citizens. As a result, by the third century the cognomen became the most important element of the Roman name, and frequently the only one that was useful for distinguishing between individuals. In the later empire, the proliferation of cognomina was such that the full nomenclature of most individuals was not recorded, and in many cases the only names surviving in extant records are cognomina.\nBy the sixth century, traditional Roman cognomina were frequently prefixed by a series of names with Christian religious significance. As Roman institutions vanished, and the distinction between nomen and cognomen ceased to have any practical importance, the complex system of cognomina that developed under the later empire faded away. The people of the western empire reverted to single names, which were indistinguishable from the cognomina that they replaced; many former praenomina and nomina also survived in this way.\nAgnomen.\nThe proliferation of cognomina in the later centuries of the Empire led some grammarians to classify certain types as \"agnomina\". This class included two main types of cognomen: the \"cognomen ex virtute\", and cognomina that were derived from nomina, to indicate the parentage of Romans who had been adopted from one gens into another. Although these names had existed throughout Roman history, it was only in this late period that they were distinguished from other cognomina.\n\"Cognomina ex virtute\".\nThe \"cognomen ex virtute\" was a surname derived from some virtuous or heroic episode attributed to the bearer. Roman history is filled with individuals who obtained cognomina as a result of their exploits: Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis, who commanded the Roman army at the Battle of Lake Regillus; Gaius Marcius Coriolanus, who captured the city of Corioli; Marcus Valerius Corvus, who defeated a giant Gaul in single combat, aided by a raven; Titus Manlius Torquatus, who likewise defeated a Gaulish giant, and took his name from the torque that he claimed as a prize; Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, who carried the Second Punic War to Africa, and defeated Hannibal. The examples most often described in scholarship on the subject regarding this class of cognomen come from the period of the Republic, centuries before the concept of the \"agnomen\" was formulated.\nAdoptive cognomina.\nAdoption was a common and formal process in Roman culture. Its chief purpose had nothing to do with providing homes for children; it was about ensuring the continuity of family lines that might otherwise become extinct. In early Rome, this was especially important for the patricians, who enjoyed tremendous status and privilege compared with the plebeians. Because few families were admitted to the patriciate after the expulsion of the kings, while the number of plebeians continually grew, the patricians continually struggled to preserve their wealth and influence. A man who had no sons to inherit his property and preserve his family name would adopt one of the younger sons from another family. In time, as the plebeians also acquired wealth and gained access to the offices of the Roman state, they too came to participate in the Roman system of adoption.\nSince the primary purpose of adoption was to preserve the name and status of the adopter, an adopted son would usually assume both the praenomen and nomen of his adoptive father, together with any hereditary cognomina, just as an eldest son would have done. However, adoption did not result in the complete abandonment of the adopted son's birth name. The son's original nomen (or occasionally cognomen) would become the basis of a new surname, formed by adding the derivative suffix \"-anus\" or \"-inus\" to the stem. Thus, when a son of Lucius Aemilius Paullus was adopted by Publius Cornelius Scipio, he became Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus.\nFiliation.\nApart from the praenomen, the \"filiation\" was the oldest element of the Roman name. Even before the development of the nomen as a hereditary surname, it was customary to use the name of a person's father as a means of distinguishing him or her from others with the same personal name, like a patronymic; thus Lucius, the son of Marcus, would be \"Lucius, Marci filius\"; Paulla, the daughter of Quintus, would be \"Paulla, Quinti filia\". Many nomina were derived in the same way, and most praenomina have at least one corresponding nomen, such as Lucilius, Marcius, Publilius, Quinctius, or Servilius. These are known as patronymic surnames, because they are derived from the name of the original bearer's father. Even after the development of the nomen and cognomen, filiation remained a useful means of distinguishing between members of a large family.\nFiliations were normally written between the nomen and any cognomina, and abbreviated using the typical abbreviations for praenomina, followed by f. for \"filius\" or \"filia\", and sometimes n. for \"nepos\" (grandson) or \"neptis\" (granddaughter). Thus, the inscription S. Postumius A. f. P. n. Albus Regillensis means \"Spurius Postumius Albus Regillensis, of Aulus the son, of Publius the grandson\". \"Tiberius Aemilius Mamercinus, the son of Lucius and grandson of Mamercus\" would be written Ti. Aemilius L. f. Mam. n. Mamercinus. The more formal the writing, the more generations might be included; a great-grandchild would be pron. or pronep. for \"pronepos\" or \"proneptis\", a great-great-grandchild abn. or abnep. for \"abnepos\" or \"abneptis\", and a great-great-great-grandchild \"adnepos\" or \"adneptis\". However, these forms are rarely included as part of a name, except on the grandest of monumental inscriptions.\nThe filiation sometimes included the name of the mother, in which case \"gnatus\" would follow the mother's name, instead of \"filius\" or \"filia\". This is especially common in families of Etruscan origin. The names of married women were sometimes followed by the husband's name and \"uxor\" for \"wife\". N. Fabius Q. f. M. n. Furia gnatus Maximus means \"Numerius Fabius Maximus, son of Quintus, grandson of Marcus, born of Furia\", while Claudia L. Valeri uxor would be \"Claudia, wife of Lucius Valerius\".\nSlaves and freedmen also possessed filiations, although in this case the person referred to is usually the slave's owner, rather than his or her father. The abbreviations here include s. for \"servus\" or \"serva\" and l. for \"libertus\" or \"liberta\". A slave might have more than one owner, in which case the names could be given serially. In some cases the owner's nomen or cognomen was used instead of or in addition to the praenomen. The \"liberti\" of women sometimes used an inverted \"C\", signifying the feminine praenomen \"Gaia\", here used generically to mean any woman; and there are a few examples of an inverted \"M\", although it is not clear whether this was used generically, or specifically for the feminine praenomen \"Marca\" or \"Marcia\".\nAn example of the filiation of slaves and freedmen would be: Alexander Corneli L. s., \"Alexander, slave of Lucius Cornelius\", who upon his emancipation would probably become L. Cornelius L. l. Alexander, \"Lucius Cornelius Alexander, freedman of Lucius\"; it was customary for a freedman to take the praenomen of his former owner, if he did not already have one, and to use his original personal name as a cognomen. Another example might be Salvia Pompeia Cn. \u0186. l., \"Salvia Pompeia, freedwoman of Gnaeus (Pompeius) and Gaia\"; here \"Gaia\" is used generically, irrespective of whether Pompeius' wife was actually named \"Gaia\". A freedman of the emperor might have the filiation Aug. l., \"Augusti libertus\".\nAlthough filiation was common throughout the history of the Republic and well into imperial times, no law governed its use or inclusion in writing. It was used by custom and for convenience, but could be ignored or discarded, as it suited the needs of the writer.\nTribe.\nFrom the beginning of the Roman Republic, all citizens were enumerated in one of the tribes making up the \"comitia tributa\", or \"tribal assembly\". This was the most democratic of Rome's three main legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic, in that all citizens could participate on an equal basis, without regard to wealth or social status. Over time, its decrees (known as \"plebi scita\", or \"plebiscites\") became binding on the whole Roman people. Although much of the assembly's authority was usurped by the emperors, membership in a tribe remained an important part of Roman citizenship, so that the name of the tribe came to be incorporated into a citizen's full nomenclature.\nThe number of tribes varied over time; tradition ascribed the institution of thirty tribes to Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome, but ten of these were destroyed at the beginning of the Republic. Several tribes were added between 387 and 241 BC, as large swaths of Italy came under Roman control, bringing the total number of tribes to thirty-five; except for a brief experiment at the end of the Social War in 88 BC, this number remained fixed. The nature of the tribes was mainly geographic, rather than ethnic; inhabitants of Rome were, in theory, assigned to one of the four \"urban\" tribes, while the territory beyond the city was allocated to the \"rural\" or \"rustic\" tribes.\nGeography was not the sole determining factor in one's \"tribus\"; at times efforts were made to assign freedmen to the four urban tribes, thus concentrating their votes and limiting their influence on the \"comitia tributa\". Perhaps for similar reasons, when large numbers of provincials gained the franchise, certain rural tribes were preferred for their enrollment. Citizens did not normally change tribes when they moved from one region to another; but the censors had the power to punish a citizen by expelling him from one of the rural tribes and assigning him to one of the urban tribes. In later periods, most citizens were enrolled in tribes without respect to geography.\nPrecisely when it became common to include the name of a citizen's \"tribus\" as part of his full nomenclature is uncertain. The name of the tribe normally follows the filiation and precedes any cognomina, suggesting that its addition preceded formal recognition of the cognomen\u2014thus, no later than the second century BC. However, in both writing and inscriptions, the \"tribus\" is found with much less frequency than other parts of the name; so the custom of including it does not seem to have been deeply ingrained in Roman practice. As with the filiation, it was common to abbreviate the name of the tribe. For the names of the thirty-five tribes and their abbreviations, see Roman tribe.\nWomen's names.\nIn the earliest period, the binomial nomenclature of praenomen and nomen that developed throughout Italy was shared by both men and women. Most praenomina had both masculine and feminine forms, although a number of praenomina common to women were seldom or never used by men. Just as men's praenomina, women's names were regularly abbreviated instead of being written in full. (A list of women's praenomina can be found at praenomen.)\nFor a variety of reasons, women's praenomina became neglected over the course of Roman history, and by the end of the Republic, most women did not have or did not use praenomina. They did not disappear entirely, nor were Roman women bereft of personal names; but for most of Roman history women were known chiefly by their nomina or cognomina. The first of these reasons is probably that the praenomen itself lost much of its original utility following the adoption of hereditary surnames; the number of praenomina commonly used by both men and women declined throughout Roman history. For men, who might hold public office or serve in the military, the praenomen remained an important part of the legal name. As Roman women played little role in public life, the factors that resulted in the continuation of men's praenomina did not exist for women.\nAnother factor was probably that the praenomen was not usually necessary to distinguish between women within the family. Because a Roman woman did not change her nomen when she married, her nomen alone was usually sufficient to distinguish her from every other member of the family. As Latin names had distinctive masculine and feminine forms, the nomen was sufficient to distinguish a daughter from both of her parents and all of her brothers. Thus, there was no need for a personal name unless there were multiple sisters in the same household.\nWhen this occurred, praenomina could be and frequently were used to distinguish between sisters. However, it was also common to identify sisters using a variety of names, some of which could be used as either praenomina or cognomina. For example, if Publius Servilius had two daughters, they would typically be referred to as \"Servilia Major\" and \"Servilia Minor\". If there were more daughters, the eldest might be called \"Servilia Prima\" or \"Servilia Maxima\"; younger daughters as \"Servilia Secunda, Tertia, Quarta\", etc. All of these names could be used as praenomina, preceding the nomen, but common usage from the later Republic onward was to treat them as personal cognomina; when these names appear in either position, it is frequently impossible to determine whether they were intended as praenomina or cognomina.\nAlthough women's praenomina were infrequently used in the later Republic, they continued to be used, when needed, into imperial times. Among the other peoples of Italy, women's praenomina continued to be used regularly until the populace was thoroughly Romanized. In the Etruscan culture, where women held a markedly higher social status than at Rome or in other ancient societies, inscriptions referring to women nearly always include praenomina.\nMost Roman women were known by their nomina, with such distinction as described above for older and younger siblings. If further distinction were needed, she could be identified as a particular citizen's daughter or wife. For instance, Cicero refers to a woman as \"Annia P. Anni senatoris filia\", which means \"Annia, daughter of Publius Annius, the senator\". However, toward the end of the Republic, as hereditary cognomina came to be regarded as proper names, a woman might be referred to by her cognomen instead, or by a combination of nomen and cognomen; the daughter of Lucius Caecilius Metellus was usually referred to as \"Caecilia Metella\". Sometimes these cognomina were given diminutive forms, such as \"Agrippina\" from the masculine \"Agrippa\", or \"Drusilla\" from \"Drusus\".\nIn imperial times, other, less formal names were sometimes used to distinguish between women with similar names. Still later, Roman women, like men, adopted \"signa\", or alternative names, in place of their Roman names. Finally, with the fall of the western empire in the fifth century, the last traces of the distinctive Italic nomenclature system began to disappear, and women too reverted to single names.\nForeign names.\nAs Roman territory expanded beyond Italy, many foreigners obtained Roman citizenship, and adopted Roman names. Often these were discharged auxiliary soldiers, or the leaders of annexed towns and peoples. Customarily a newly enfranchised citizen would adopt the praenomen and nomen of his patron; that is, the person who had adopted or manumitted him, or otherwise procured his citizenship. But many such individuals retained a portion of their original names, usually in the form of cognomina. This was especially true for citizens of Greek origin. A name such as T. Flavius Aristodemus or Gaius Julius Hyginus would be typical of such persons, although in form these names are not distinguishable from those of freedmen.\nThe \"Constitutio Antoniniana\" promulgated by Caracalla in AD 212 was perhaps the most far-reaching of many imperial decrees enfranchising large numbers of non-citizens living throughout the empire. It extended citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire, all of whom thus received the name \"Marcus Aurelius\", after the emperor's praenomen and nomen. The result was that vast numbers of individuals who had never possessed praenomina or nomina formally shared the same names. In turn, many of the \"new Romans\" promptly discarded their praenomina, and ignored their nomina except when required by formality. As a result, the cognomina adopted by these citizens, often including their original non-Latin names, became the most important part of their nomenclature.\nLater development.\nDuring the Empire, a variety of new naming conventions developed which, while differing, were internally coherent.\nBinary nomenclature and polyonymy.\nUnder the \"High Empire\", the new aristocracy began adopting two or more nomina \u2013 a practice which has been termed 'binary nomenclature'. This arose out of a desire to incorporate distinguished maternal ancestry in a name or, in order to inherit property, an heir was required by a will to incorporate the testator's name into his own name. For example, the suffect consul of AD 118/9, Gaius Bruttius Praesens Lucius Fulvius Rusticus, has a name which is composed of two standard sets of tria nomina: he was the natural son of a Lucius Bruttius, and added the nomina of his maternal grandfather, Lucius Fulvius Rusticus, to his paternal nomina.\nIn order to reflect an illustrious pedigree or other connections, the aristocracy expanded the binary nomenclature concept to include other nomina from an individual's paternal and maternal ancestry. There was no limit to the number of names which could be added in this way (known as polyonomy), and, for example, the consul of 169 AD (usually called Q. Sosius Priscus), had thirty-eight names comprising fourteen sets of nomina, reflecting a complex pedigree stretching back three generations.\nCognomen replaces praenomen.\nThe praenomen, even under the classic system, had never been particularly distinctive because of the limited number of praenomina available. Between the late Republic and the second century AD, the praenomen gradually became less used and eventually disappeared altogether. Even among the senatorial aristocracy it became a rarity by about 300 AD. In part this came about through a tendency for the same praenomen to be given to all males of a family, thereby fossilizing a particular praenomen/nomen combination and making the praenomen even less distinctive, e.g. all males in the emperor Vespasian's family (including all his sons) had the praenomen/nomen combination Titus Flavius:\nThe cognomen, as in Vespasian's family, then assumed the distinguishing function for individuals; where this happened, the cognomen replaced the praenomen in intimate address. The result was that two names remained in use for formal public address but instead of praenomen + nomen, it became nomen + cognomen.\nEdict of Caracalla.\nWith the Constitutio Antoniniana in 212, the emperor Caracalla granted Roman citizenship to all free inhabitants of the empire. It had long been the expectation that when a non-Roman acquired citizenship he, as part of his enfranchisement, took on a Roman name. With the mass enfranchisement of 212, the new citizens adopted the nomen \"Aurelius\" in recognition of Caracalla's beneficence (the emperor's full name was Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Augustus, with Aurelius as the nomen). \"Aurelius\" quickly became the most common nomen in the east and the second most common (after \"Julius\") in the west. The change in the origins of the new governing elite that assumed control of the empire from the end of the third century can be seen in their names: seven of the eleven emperors between Gallienus and Diocletian (Claudius Gothicus, Quintillus, Probus, Carus, Carinus, Numerian and Maximian) bore the name \"Marcus Aurelius\".\nAlthough praenomina were not adopted by the new citizens, reflecting the pre-existing decline amongst \"old\" Romans, in the west the new names were formulated on the same basis as the existing Roman practices. In the east, however, the new citizens formulated their names by placing \"Aurelius\" before versions of their non-Roman given name and a patronymic. Ultimately, the ubiquity of \"Aurelius\" meant that it could not function as a true distinguishing nomen, and became primarily just a badge of citizenship added to any name.\nTraditional nomen replaced.\nAlthough a nomen would long be required for official purposes, and, in isolated corners of the empire and in parts of Italy, its usage would persist into the seventh century, the nomen was generally omitted from the name (even of emperors) by the third century.\nTwo factors encouraged its frequent non-use. Firstly, the cognomen increasingly became the distinguishing name and general name of address. As a result, \"New Romans\" and, under their influence, \"old Romans\" too, either dropped the nomen from their name or, in some cases, treated the nomen as a praenomen.\nSecondly, with the nomen becoming an increasingly fossilized formality, non-Italian families, even those who had acquired citizenship and a nomen prior to 212, began to ignore their nomen. When a nomen was required for official purposes they would simply put the default nomen of \"Aurelius\" in front of their name, rather than use their actual nomen.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48129", "revid": "39165258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48129", "title": "Alsace", "text": "Region of France\nAlsace is a cultural region and a territorial collectivity in the Grand Est administrative region of northeastern France, on the west bank of the upper Rhine, next to Germany and Switzerland. In January 2021, it had a population of 1,919,745. Alsatian culture is characterized by a blend of German and French influences.\nUntil 1871, Alsace included the area now known as the Territoire de Belfort, which formed its southernmost part. From 1982 to 2016, Alsace was the smallest administrative in metropolitan France, consisting of the Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin departments. Territorial reform passed by the French Parliament in 2014 resulted in the merger of the Alsace administrative region with Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine to form Grand Est. On 1 January 2021, the departments of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin merged into the new European Collectivity of Alsace but remained part of the region Grand Est.\nAlsatian is an Alemannic dialect closely related to Swabian, although since World War II most Alsatians primarily speak French. Internal and international migration since 1945 has also changed the ethnolinguistic composition of Alsace. For more than 300 years, from the Thirty Years' War to World War II, the political status of Alsace was heavily contested between France and various German states in wars and diplomatic conferences. The economic and cultural capital of Alsace, as well as its largest city, is Strasbourg, which sits on the present German international border. The city is the seat of several international organizations and bodies.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Alsace\" can be traced to the Old High German or \"Elisaz\", meaning \"foreign domain\". An alternative explanation is from a Germanic \"Ell-sass\", meaning \"seated on the Ill\", a river in Alsace.\nHistory.\nIn prehistoric times, Alsace was inhabited by nomadic hunters. Part of the province of Germania Superior in the Roman Empire, the area went on to become a diffuse border region between the French and the German cultures and languages. Long a center of the German-speaking world, after the end of the Thirty Years' War, southern Alsace was annexed by France in 1648, with most of the remainder conquered later in the century. In contrast to other parts of France, Protestants were permitted to practise their faith in Alsace even after the Edict of Fontainebleau of 1685 that abolished their privileges in the rest of France.\nAfter the 1870\u201371 Franco-Prussian War, Alsace was annexed by Germany and became a part of the 1871 unified German Empire as a formal \"Reichsland\", or \"imperial territory.\" After World War I the victorious Allies detached it from Germany and the province became part of the Third French Republic. Having been occupied and annexed by Germany during World War II, it was returned to France by the Allies at the end of World War II.\nPre-Roman Alsace.\nThe presence of hominids in Alsace can be traced back 600,000 years. By 4000 BC, farming arrived in the form of Linear Pottery culture in the region from the Danube and the Hungarian plain. The culture was characterized by \"timber longhouse settlements and incised pottery ... favoring floodplain edge situations for their permanent villages ... [and] small clearings in the forest\" for their crops and animals.\"\nBy 100 BC, Germanic peoples, including eventually the Suebi and other tribes under Ariovistus, had begun to intrude into areas along the upper Rhine and Danube long settled by Celtic Gauls. Alsace itself had come to be occupied by the Triboci, a Germanic tribe allied with Ariovistus.\nRoman Alsace.\nIn response to the threat posted by Ariovistus, the Aedui, a Celtic tribe allied to Rome, appealed to the Roman Senate and Julius Caesar for aid. In 58 BC, after negotiations with Ariovistus failed, Julius Caesar routed the Suebi at the foot of the Vosges near what became Cernay in southern Alsace. There followed a \"long period of security ... for the Gauls along the middle and upper Rhine.\"\nFrom the time of Augustus to the early fifth century AD, the area of Alsace was incorporated into the Roman province of Germania Superior. As a border province, the Romans built fortifications and military camps, many of which, including Argentoratum (Strasbourg), evolved into modern towns and cities.\nAlemannic and Frankish Alsace.\nIn 357, Germanic tribes attempted to conquer Alsace but they were rebuffed by the Romans. With the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the eldest grandson Lothar I.\nLothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880. Alsace was united with the other Alemanni east of the Rhine into the stem duchy of Swabia.\nAlsace within the Holy Roman Empire.\nAt about this time, the surrounding areas experienced recurring fragmentation and reincorporations among a number of feudal secular and ecclesiastical lordships, a common process in the Holy Roman Empire. Alsace experienced great prosperity during the 12th and 13th centuries under Hohenstaufen emperors.\nFrederick I set up Alsace as a province (a \"procuratio\", not a \"provincia\") to be ruled by ministeriales, a non-noble class of civil servants. The idea was that such men would be more tractable and less likely to alienate the fief from the crown out of their own greed. The province had a single provincial court (\"Landgericht\") and a central administration with its seat at Hagenau. Frederick II designated the Bishop of Strasbourg to administer Alsace, but the authority of the bishop was challenged by Count Rudolf of Habsburg, who received his rights from Frederick II's son Conrad IV. Strasbourg began to grow to become the most populous and commercially important town in the region.\nIn 1262, after a long struggle with the ruling bishops, its citizens gained the status of free imperial city. A stop on the Paris-Vienna-Orient trade route, as well as a port on the Rhine route linking southern Germany and Switzerland to the Netherlands, England and Scandinavia, it became the political and economic center of the region. Cities such as Colmar and Hagenau also began to grow in economic importance and gained a kind of autonomy within the \"D\u00e9capole\" (or \"Zehnst\u00e4dtebund\"), a federation of ten free towns.\nThough little is known about the early history of the Jews of Alsace, there is a lot of information from the 12th century onwards. They were successful as moneylenders and had the favor of the Emperor. As in much of Europe, the prosperity of Alsace was brought to an end in the 14th century by a series of harsh winters, bad harvests, and the Black Death. These hardships were blamed on Jews, leading to the pogroms of 1336 and 1339. In 1349, Jews of Alsace were accused of poisoning the wells with plague, leading to the massacre of thousands of Jews during the Strasbourg pogrom. Jews were subsequently forbidden to settle in the town. An additional natural disaster was the Rhine rift earthquake of 1356, one of Europe's worst which made ruins of Basel. Prosperity returned to Alsace under Habsburg administration during the Renaissance.\nHoly Roman Empire central power had begun to decline following years of imperial adventures in Italian lands, often ceding hegemony in Western Europe to France, which had long since centralized power. France began an aggressive policy of expanding eastward, first to the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Meuse, and when those borders were reached, aiming for the Rhine. In 1299 the French proposed a marriage alliance between Blanche (sister of Philip IV of France) and Rudolf (son of Albert I of Germany), with Alsace to be the dowry; however, the deal never came off. In 1307, the town of Belfort was first chartered by the Counts of Montb\u00e9liard. During the next century, France was to be militarily shattered by the Hundred Years' War, which prevented for a time any further tendencies in this direction. After the conclusion of the war, France was again free to pursue its desire to reach the Rhine and in 1444 a French army appeared in Lorraine and Alsace. It took up winter quarters, demanded the submission of Metz and Strasbourg and launched an attack on Basel.\nIn 1469, following the Treaty of St. Omer, Upper Alsace was sold by Archduke Sigismund of Austria to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Although Charles was the nominal landlord, taxes were paid to Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. The latter was able to use this tax and a dynastic marriage to his advantage to gain back full control of Upper Alsace (apart from the free towns, but including Belfort) in 1477 when it became part of the demesne of the Habsburg family, who were also rulers of the empire. The town of Mulhouse joined the Swiss Confederation in 1515, where it was to remain until 1798.\nBy the time of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, Strasbourg was a prosperous community, and its inhabitants accepted Protestantism in 1523. Martin Bucer was a prominent Protestant reformer in the region. His efforts were countered by the Roman Catholic Habsburgs who tried to eradicate heresy in Upper Alsace. As a result, Alsace was transformed into a mosaic of Catholic and Protestant territories. On the other hand, M\u00f6mpelgard (Montb\u00e9liard) to the southwest of Alsace, belonging to the Counts of W\u00fcrttemberg since 1397, remained a Protestant enclave in France until 1793.\nGerman \"Land\" within the Kingdom of France.\nThis situation prevailed until 1639, when most of Alsace was conquered by France to keep it out of the hands of the Spanish Habsburgs, who by secret treaty in 1617 had gained a clear road to their valuable and rebellious possessions in the Spanish Netherlands, the Spanish Road. Beset by enemies and seeking to gain a free hand in Hungary, the Habsburgs sold their Sundgau territory (mostly in Upper Alsace) to France in 1646, which had occupied it, for the sum of 1.2\u00a0million Thalers. When hostilities were concluded in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia, most of Alsace was recognized as part of France, although some towns remained independent. The treaty stipulations regarding Alsace were complex. Although the French king gained sovereignty, existing rights and customs of the inhabitants were largely preserved. France continued to maintain its customs border along the Vosges mountains where it had been, leaving Alsace more economically oriented to neighbouring German-speaking lands. The German language remained in use in local administration, in schools, and at the (Lutheran) University of Strasbourg, which continued to draw students from other German-speaking lands. The 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau, by which the French king ordered the suppression of French Protestantism, was not applied in Alsace. France did endeavour to promote Catholicism. Strasbourg Cathedral, for example, which had been Lutheran from 1524 to 1681, was returned to the Catholic Church. However, compared to the rest of France, Alsace enjoyed a climate of religious tolerance.\nFrance consolidated its hold with the 1679 Treaties of Nijmegen, which brought most remaining towns under its control. France seized Strasbourg in 1681 in an unprovoked action. These territorial changes were recognised in the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick that ended the War of the Grand Alliance.\nBut Alsace still contained islands of territory nominally under the sovereignty of German princes and an independent city-state at Mulhouse. These enclaves were established by law, prescription and international consensus.\nFrom French Revolution to the Franco-Prussian War.\nThe year 1789 brought the French Revolution and with it the first division of Alsace into the d\u00e9partements of Haut- and Bas-Rhin. Alsatians played an active role in the French Revolution. On 21 July 1789, after receiving news of the Storming of the Bastille in Paris, a crowd of people stormed the Strasbourg city hall, forcing the city administrators to flee and putting symbolically an end to the feudal system in Alsace. In 1792, Rouget de Lisle composed in Strasbourg the Revolutionary marching song \"La Marseillaise\" (as \"Marching song for the Army of the Rhine\"), which later became the anthem of France. \"La Marseillaise\" was played for the first time in April of that year in front of the mayor of Strasbourg Philippe-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Dietrich. Some of the most famous generals of the French Revolution also came from Alsace, notably Kellermann, the victor of Valmy, Kl\u00e9ber, who led the armies of the French Republic in Vend\u00e9e, and Westermann, who also fought in the Vend\u00e9e.\nMulhouse (a city in southern Alsace), which had been part of Switzerland since 1466, joined France in 1798.\nAt the same time, some Alsatians were in opposition to the Jacobins and sympathetic to the restoration of the monarchy pursued by the invading forces of Austria and Prussia who sought to crush the nascent revolutionary republic. Many of the residents of the Sundgau made \"pilgrimages\" to places like Mariastein Abbey, near Basel, in Switzerland, for baptisms and weddings. When the French Revolutionary Army of the Rhine was victorious, tens of thousands fled east before it. When they were later permitted to return (in some cases not until 1799), it was often to find that their lands and homes had been confiscated. These conditions led to emigration by hundreds of families to newly vacant lands in the Russian Empire in 1803\u20134 and again in 1808. A poignant retelling of this event based on what Goethe had personally witnessed can be found in his long poem \"Hermann and Dorothea\".\nIn response to the \"hundred day\" restoration of Napoleon in 1815, Alsace along with other frontier provinces of France was occupied by foreign forces from 1815 to 1818, including over 280,000 soldiers and 90,000 horses in Bas-Rhin alone. This had grave effects on trade and the economy of the region since former overland trade routes were switched to newly opened Mediterranean and Atlantic seaports.\nThe population grew rapidly, from 800,000 in 1814 to 914,000 in 1830 and 1,067,000 in 1846. The combination of economic and demographic factors led to hunger, housing shortages and a lack of work for young people. Thus, it is not surprising that people left Alsace, not only for Paris \u2013 where the Alsatian community grew in numbers, with famous members such as Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann \u2013 but also for more distant places like Russia and the Austrian Empire, to take advantage of the new opportunities offered there: Austria had conquered lands in Eastern Europe from the Ottoman Empire and offered generous terms to colonists as a way of consolidating its hold on the new territories. Many Alsatians also began to sail to the United States, settling in many areas from 1820 to 1850. In 1843 and 1844, sailing ships bringing immigrant families from Alsace arrived at the port of New York. Some settled in Texas and Illinois, many to farm or to seek success in commercial ventures: for example, the sailing ships \"Sully\" (in May 1843) and \"Iowa\" (in June 1844) brought families who set up homes in northern Illinois and northern Indiana. Some Alsatian immigrants were noted for their roles in 19th-century American economic development. Others ventured to Canada to settle in southwestern Ontario, notably Waterloo County.\nAlsatian Jews.\nIn contrast to the rest of France, the Jews in Alsace had not been expelled during the Middle Ages. By 1790, the Jewish population of Alsace was approximately 22,500, about 3% of the provincial population. They were highly segregated and subject to long-standing antisemitic regulations. They maintained their own customs, Yiddish language, and historic traditions within the tightly knit ghettos; they adhered to Jewish law. Jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages. They concentrated in trade, services, and banking. They financed about a third of the mortgages in Alsace. Official tolerance grew during the French Revolution, with full emancipation in 1791. However, local antisemitism also increased and Napoleon turned hostile in 1806, imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews. In the 1830\u20131870 era, most Jews moved to the cities, where they integrated and acculturated, as antisemitism sharply declined. By 1831, the state began paying salaries to official rabbis, and in 1846 a special legal oath for Jews was discontinued. Antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred, especially during the Revolution of 1848. The merger of Alsace into Germany in 1871\u20131918 lessened antisemitic violence. The constitution of the \"Reichsland\" of 1911 reserved one seat in the first chamber of the \"Landtag\" for a representative of the Jewish Consistory of Alsace\u2013Lorraine (besides two seats respectively for the two main Christian denominations).\nStruggle between France and united Germany.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"We Germans who know Germany and France know better what is good for the Alsatians than the unfortunates themselves. In the perversion of their French life they have no exact idea of what concerns Germany.\"\u2014\u200a\nThe Franco-Prussian War, which started in July 1870, saw France defeated in May 1871 by the Kingdom of Prussia and other German states. The end of the war led to the unification of Germany. Otto von Bismarck annexed Alsace and northern Lorraine to the new German Empire in 1871. France ceded more than 90% of Alsace and one-fourth of Lorraine, as stipulated in the treaty of Frankfurt; Belfort, the largest Alsatian town south of Mulhouse, remained French. Unlike other member states of the German federation, which had governments of their own, the new \"Imperial territory of Alsace\u2013Lorraine\" was under the sole authority of the Kaiser, administered directly by the imperial government in Berlin. Between 100,000 and 130,000 Alsatians (of a total population of about a million and a half) chose to remain French citizens and leave \"Reichsland Elsa\u00df\u2013Lothringen\", many of them resettling in French Algeria as Pieds-Noirs. Only in 1911 was Alsace\u2013Lorraine granted some measure of autonomy, which was manifested also in a flag and an anthem (Els\u00e4ssisches Fahnenlied). In 1913, however, the Saverne Affair (\"French\": Incident de Saverne) showed the limits of this new tolerance of the Alsatian identity.\nDuring the First World War, to avoid ground fights between brothers, many Alsatians served as sailors in the Kaiserliche Marine and took part in the Naval mutinies that led to the abdication of the Kaiser in November 1918, which left Alsace\u2013Lorraine without a nominal head of state. The sailors returned home and tried to found an independent republic. While Jacques Peirotes, at this time deputy at the \"Landrat Elsass\u2013Lothringen\" and just elected mayor of Strasbourg, proclaimed the forfeiture of the German Empire and the advent of the French Republic, a self-proclaimed government of Alsace\u2013Lorraine declared its independence as the \"Republic of Alsace\u2013Lorraine\". French troops entered Alsace less than two weeks later to quash the worker strikes and remove the newly established Soviets and revolutionaries from power. With the arrival of the French soldiers, many Alsatians and local Prussian/German administrators and bureaucrats cheered the re-establishment of order.\nAlthough U.S. President Woodrow Wilson had insisted that the \"r\u00e9gion\" was self-ruling by legal status, as its constitution had stated it was bound to the sole authority of the Kaiser and not to the German state, France would allow no plebiscite, as granted by the League of Nations to some eastern German territories at this time, because the French regarded the Alsatians as Frenchmen liberated from German rule. Germany ceded the region to France under the Treaty of Versailles.\nPolicies forbidding the use of German and requiring French were promptly introduced. In order not to antagonize the Alsatians, the region was not subjected to some legal changes that had occurred in the rest of France between 1871 and 1919, such as the 1905 French law on the separation of Church and State.\nAlsace\u2013Lorraine was occupied by Germany in June 1940 during the Second World War. Although never formally annexed, Alsace and Lorraine were incorporated into the Greater German Reich. Each was placed under a Chief of Civil Administration (CdZ), who was the Nazi Party \"Gauleiter\" and \"Reichsstatthalter\" (Reich Governor) of the adjacent German territory. Alsace was administered as part of Gau Baden under Robert Heinrich Wagner and his deputy, Hermann R\u00f6hn. Lorraine was administered as part of the Gau Saarpfalz, (later Gau Westmark) under Josef B\u00fcrckel and his deputy, Ernst Ludwig Leyser. During the war, 130,000 young men from Alsace and Lorraine were conscripted into the German armies against their will (malgr\u00e9-nous). There were some volunteers for the Waffen SS., although they were outnumbered by conscripts of the 1926\u20131927 classes. Thirty of said Waffen SS were involved in the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre (29 conscripts, one volunteer). A third of the malgr\u00e9-nous perished on the Eastern front. In July 1944, 1500 malgr\u00e9-nous were released from Soviet captivity and sent to Algiers, where they joined the Free French Forces.\nAfter World War II.\nToday, the territory is in certain areas subject to some laws that are significantly different from the rest of France, which is known as the local law.\nIn more recent years, the Alsatian language is again being promoted by local, national and European authorities as an element of the region's identity. Alsatian is taught in schools (but is not mandatory) as one of the regional languages of France. German is also taught as a foreign language in local kindergartens and schools. There is a growing network of schools proposing full immersion in Alsatian dialect and in Standard German, called \"ABCM-Zweisprachigkeit\" (ABCM -&gt; French acronym for \"Association for Bilingualism in the Classroom from Kindergarten onwards\", Zweisprachigkeit -&gt; German for \"Bilingualism\"). However, the Constitution of France still requires that French be the only official language of the Republic.\nAlsatian was portrayed as a \"Germanic\" dialect not having standard German as its Dachsprache. French government institutions employ a variety of means to prevent the German-speaking Alsatians from publishing media in their native language. Until recently, this was even prohibited under penalty of law. Sports and youth news in particular are not allowed to be published in German.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nAlsace has an area of 8,283\u00a0km2, making it the smallest of metropolitan France until 2016. It is almost four times longer than it is wide, corresponding to a plain between the Rhine in the east and the Vosges mountains in the west.\nIt includes the of Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin (known previously as Sundgau and Nordgau). It borders Germany on the north and the east, Switzerland and Franche-Comt\u00e9 on the south and Lorraine on the west.\nSeveral valleys are also found in the . Its highest point is the Grand Ballon in Haut-Rhin, which reaches a height of . It contains many forests, primarily in the Vosges and in Bas-Rhin (Haguenau Forest).\nThe ried lies along the Rhine.\nGeology.\nAlsace is the part of the plain of the Rhine located at the west of the Rhine, on its left bank. It is a rift or graben, from the Oligocene epoch, associated with its horsts: the Vosges and the Black Forest.\nThe Jura Mountains, formed by slip (induced by the alpine uplift) of the Mesozoic cover on the Triassic formations, goes through the area of Belfort.\nClimate.\nThe climate in Alsace is semi-continental with cold and dry winters (cool days, frosty nights) and hot, stormy summers (frequent stifling days, cool to mild nights). It doesn't rain much in the area because of the protection offered by the Vosges mountains. At higher altitude, the climate is cooler overall although with less cold and heat extremes. The city of Colmar has a sunny microclimate; it is the second driest city in France, with an annual precipitation of around , making it ideal for (\"Alsatian wine\").\nGovernance.\nSince 2021, Alsace has been a territorial collectivity called the European Collectivity of Alsace (\"collectivit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne d'Alsace\").\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe European Collectivity of Alsace is divided into 2 departmental constituencies (\"circonscriptions d\u00e9partementales\"), 9 departmental arrondissements, 40 cantons, and 880 communes.\nBas-Rhin\nHaut-Rhin\nSociety.\nDemographics.\nAlsace's population increased to 1,919,745 in 2021. It has regularly increased over time, except in wartime and shortly after the German annexation of 1871 (when many Alsatians who had opted to keep their French citizenship emigrated to France), by both natural growth and immigration. High population growth during the post-WW2 economic boom of the \"Trente Glorieuses\" ended after the 1973 oil crisis. Demographic growth picked up again in the 1990s and 2000s. But by the 2010s, Alsace had entered a new period of slow demographic growth, though the Strasbourg area had become one of France's fastest growing regions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nImmigration.\nAt the 2018 census, 69.9% of the inhabitants of Alsace were natives of Alsace, 16.0% were born in the rest of Metropolitan France, 0.5% were born in Overseas France, and 13.7% were born in foreign countries. Nearly 44% of the immigrants come from Europe, in particular from Germany (natives of Germany residing in Alsace where housing is cheaper), Italy, Portugal and Serbia. Since 2008, the number of Turkish immigrants living in Alsace has declined, whereas the number of Maghreban immigrants has risen less than the number of European immigrants. The fastest growing groups of immigrants are those from Asia and from sub-Saharan Africa.\nReligion.\nAlsace is generally seen as the most religious of all the French regions. Most of the Alsatian population is Roman Catholic, but, largely because of the region's German heritage, a significant Protestant community also exists: today, the EPCAAL (a Lutheran church) is France's second largest Protestant church, also forming an administrative union (UEPAL) with the much smaller Calvinist EPRAL. Unlike the rest of France, the Local law in Alsace\u2013Moselle still provides for the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 and the organic articles, which provides public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues; religion classes in one of these faiths are compulsory in public schools. The divergence in policy from the French majority is because the region was part of Imperial Germany when the 1905 law separating the French church and state was instituted (for a more comprehensive history, see Alsace\u2013Lorraine). Controversy erupts periodically on the appropriateness of that legal disposition, as well as on the exclusion of other religions from the arrangement.\nFollowing the Protestant Reformation, promoted by the local reformer Martin Bucer, the principle of \"cuius regio, eius religio\" led to a certain amount of religious diversity in the highlands of northern Alsace. Landowners, who as \"local lords\" had the right to decide the religion that was allowed on their land, were eager to entice populations from the more attractive lowlands to settle and develop their property. Many accepted without discrimination Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews and Anabaptists. Multiconfessional villages appeared, particularly in the region of Alsace bossue. Alsace became one of the French regions boasting a thriving Jewish community and the only region with a noticeable Anabaptist population. Philipp Jakob Spener who founded Pietism was born in Alsace. The schism of the Amish under the lead of Jacob Amman from the Mennonites occurred in 1693 in Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines. The strongly Catholic Louis XIV tried in vain to drive them from Alsace. When Napoleon imposed military conscription without religious exception, most emigrated to the American continent.\nIn 1707, the simultaneum forced many Reformed and Lutheran church buildings to also allow Catholic services. About 50 such \"simultaneous churches\" still exist in modern Alsace, but with the Catholic church's general lack of priests, they tend to hold Catholic services only occasionally.\nCulture.\nAlsace historically was part of the Holy Roman Empire and the German realm of culture. Since the 17th century, the region has passed between German and French control numerous times, resulting in a cultural blend. German traits remain in the more traditional, rural parts of the culture, such as the cuisine and architecture, whereas modern institutions are totally dominated by French culture.\nSymbolism.\nStrasbourg.\nStrasbourg's arms are the colours of the shield of the Bishop of Strasbourg (a band of red on a white field, also considered an inversion of the arms of the diocese) at the end of a revolt of the burghers during the Middle Ages who took their independence from the teachings of the Bishop. It retains its power over the surrounding area.\nFlags.\nThere is controversy around the recognition of the Alsatian flag. The authentic historical flag is the \"Rot-un-Wiss\"; Red and White are commonly found on the coat of arms of Alsatian cities (Strasbourg, Mulhouse, S\u00e9lestat...) and of many Swiss cities, especially in Basel's region. The German region Hesse uses a flag similar to the Rot-un-Wiss. As it underlines the Germanic roots of the region, it was \"replaced\" in 1949 by a new \"Union jack-like\" flag representing the union of the two d\u00e9partements. It has, however, no real historical relevance. It has been since replaced again by a slightly different one, also representing the two d\u00e9partements. With the purpose of \"Francizing\" the region, the Rot-un-Wiss has not been recognized by Paris. Some overzealous statesmen have called it a Nazi invention \u2013 while its origins date back to the 11th century and the Red and White banner of G\u00e9rard de Lorraine (aka. d'Alsace). The Rot-un-Wiss flag is still known as the real historical emblem of the region by most of the population and the d\u00e9partements' parliaments and has been widely used during protests against the creation of a new \"super-region\" gathering Champagne-Ardennes, Lorraine and Alsace, namely on Colmar's statue of liberty.\nLanguage.\nAlthough German dialects were spoken in Alsace for most of its history, the dominant language in Alsace today is French.\nThe traditional language of the \"r\u00e9gion\" is Alsatian, an Alemannic dialect of Upper German spoken on both sides of the Rhine and closely related to Swiss German. Some Frankish dialects of West Central German are also spoken in \"Alsace Bossue\" and in the extreme north of Alsace. As is customary for regional languages in France, neither Alsatian nor the Frankish dialects have any form of official status, although both are now recognized as languages of France and can be chosen as subjects in lyc\u00e9es.\nAlthough Alsace has been part of France multiple times in the past, the region had no direct connection with the French state for several centuries. From the end of the Roman Empire (5th century) to the French annexation (17th century), Alsace was politically part of the German world.\nDuring the Lutheran Reform, the towns of Alsace were the first to adopt the German language as their official language instead of Latin. It was in Strasbourg that German was first used for the liturgy. It was also in Strasbourg that the first German Bible was published in 1466.\nFrom the annexation of Alsace by France in the 17th century and the language policy of the French Revolution up to 1870, knowledge of French in Alsace increased considerably. With the education reforms of the 19th century, the middle classes began to speak and write French well. The French language never really managed, however, to win over the masses, the vast majority of whom continued to speak their German dialects and write in German (which we would now call \"standard German\").\nBetween 1870 and 1918, Alsace was annexed by the German Empire in the form of an imperial province or Reichsland, and the mandatory official language, especially in schools, became High German. French lost ground to such an extent that it has been estimated that only 2% of the population spoke French fluently, and only 8% had some knowledge of it (Maugue, 1970).\nAfter 1918, French was the only language used in schools, particularly primary schools. After much argument and discussion and after many temporary measures, a memorandum was issued by Vice-Chancellor Pfister in 1927 and governed education in primary schools until 1939.\nDuring a reannexation by Germany (1940\u20131945), High German was reinstated as the language of education. The population was forced to speak German and 'French' family names were Germanized. Following the Second World War, the 1927 regulation was not reinstated, and the teaching of German in primary schools was suspended by a provisional rectorial decree, which was supposed to enable French to regain lost ground. The teaching of German became a major issue, however, as early as 1946. After World War II, the French government pursued, in line with its traditional language policy, a campaign to suppress the use of German as part of a wider Francization campaign. The local German dialect was rendered a backward regional \"Germanic\" dialect not being attached to German.\nIn 1951, Article 10 of the Deixonne Law (\"Loi Deixonne\") on the teaching of local languages and dialects made provision for Breton, Basque, Catalan and old Proven\u00e7al but not for Corsican, Dutch (West Flemish) or Alsatian in Alsace and Moselle. However, in a Decree of 18 December 1952, supplemented by an Order of 19 December of the same year, optional teaching of the German language was introduced in elementary schools in communes in which the language of habitual use was the Alsatian dialect.\nIn 1972, the Inspector General of German, Georges Holderith, obtained authorization to reintroduce German into 33 intermediate classes on an experimental basis. This teaching of German, referred to as the Holderith Reform, was later extended to all pupils in the last two years of elementary school. This reform is still largely the basis of German teaching (but not Alsatian) in elementary schools today.\nIt was not until 9 June 1982, with the \"Circulaire sur la langue et la culture r\u00e9gionales en Alsace\" (Memorandum on regional language and culture in Alsace) issued by the Vice-Chancellor of the Acad\u00e9mie Pierre Deyon, that the teaching of German in primary schools in Alsace really began to be given more official status. The Ministerial Memorandum of 21 June 1982, known as the Circulaire Savary, introduced financial support, over three years, for the teaching of regional languages in schools and universities. This memorandum was, however, implemented in a fairly lax manner.\nBoth Alsatian and Standard German were for a time banned from public life (including street and city names, official administration, and educational system). Though the ban has long been lifted and street signs today are often bilingual, Alsace\u2013Lorraine is today predominantly French in language and culture. Few young people speak Alsatian today, although there do still exist one or two enclaves in the Sundgau region where some older inhabitants cannot speak French, and where Alsatian is still used as the mother tongue. A related Alemannic German survives on the opposite bank of the Rhine, in Baden, and especially in Switzerland. However, while French is the major language of the region, the Alsatian dialect of French is heavily influenced by German and other languages such as Yiddish in phonology and vocabulary.\nThis situation has spurred a movement to preserve the Alsatian language, which is perceived as endangered, a situation paralleled in other \"r\u00e9gions\" of France, such as Brittany or Occitania. Alsatian is now taught in French high schools. Increasingly, French is the only language used at home and at work, and a growing number of people have a good knowledge of standard German as a foreign language learned in school.\nThe constitution of the Fifth Republic states that French alone is the official language of the Republic. However, Alsatian, along with other regional languages, are recognized by the French government in the official list of languages of France.\nAlthough the French government signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 1992, it never ratified the treaty and therefore no legal basis exists for any of the regional languages in France. However, visitors to Alsace can see indications of renewed political and cultural interest in the language \u2013 in Alsatian signs appearing on hoardings and in car windows, as well as in new official bilingual street signs in Strasbourg and Mulhouse.\nA 1999 INSEE survey, included in the 1999 Census, the majority of the population in Alsace speak French as their first language, 39.0% (or 500,000 people) of the population speak Alsatian, 16.2% (or 208,000 people) speak German, 75,200 people speak English (or 5.9%) and 27,600 people speak Italian.\nThe survey counted 548,000 adult speakers of Alsatian in France, making it the second most-spoken regional language in the country (after Occitan). Like all regional languages in France, however, the transmission of Alsatian is on the decline. While 39% of the adult population of Alsace speak the dialect, only one in four children speak it, and only one in ten children uses it regularly.\nAccording to a 2022 study, 46% of the population of Alsace still describe themselves as dialect-speakers. At the same time, 54% reported speaking Standard German. The older generation tends to speak Alsatian, while the younger generation tends to speak Standard German.\nArchitecture.\nThe traditional habitat of the Alsatian lowland, like in other regions of Germany and Northern Europe, consists of houses constructed with walls in timber framing and cob and roofing in flat tiles. This type of construction is abundant in adjacent parts of Germany and can be seen in other areas of France, but their particular abundance in Alsace is owed to several reasons:\nHowever, half-timbering was found to increase the risk of fire, which is why from the 19th century, it began to be rendered. In recent times, villagers started to paint the rendering white in accordance with Beaux-Arts movements. To discourage this, the region's authorities gave financial grants to the inhabitants to paint the rendering in various colours, in order to return to the original style and many inhabitants accepted (more for financial reasons than by firm belief).\nCuisine.\nAlsatian cuisine, somewhat based on German culinary traditions, is marked by the use of pork in various forms. It is perhaps mostly known for the region's wines and beers. Traditional dishes include \"baeckeoffe\", \"flammekueche\", \"choucroute\", and \"fleischnacka\". Southern Alsace, also called the Sundgau, is characterized by \"carpe frite\" (that also exists in Yiddish tradition).\nFood.\nThe festivities of the year's end involve the production of a great variety of biscuits and small cakes called \"bredela\" as well as (gingerbread cakes) which are baked around Christmas time. The Kugelhupf is also popular in Alsace, and the Christstollen during the Christmas season.\nA gastronomic symbol of the is the Choucroute, a local variety of Sauerkraut. The word Sauerkraut in Alsatian has the form , same as in other southwestern German dialects, and means \"sour cabbage\" as its Standard German equivalent. This word was included into the French language as . To make it, the cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt and juniper and left to ferment in wooden barrels. Sauerkraut can be served with poultry, pork, sausage or even fish. Traditionally it is served with Strasbourg sausage or frankfurters, bacon, smoked pork or smoked Morteau or Montb\u00e9liard sausages, or a selection of other pork products. Served alongside are often roasted or steamed potatoes or dumplings.\nAlsace is also well known for its foie gras made in the region since the 17th century. Additionally, Alsace is known for its fruit juices and mineral waters.\nWines.\nAlsace is an important wine-producing \"r\u00e9gion\". \"Vins d'Alsace\" (Alsace wines) are mostly white. Alsace produces some of the world's most noted dry rieslings and is the only region in France to produce mostly varietal wines identified by the names of the grapes used (wine from Burgundy is also mainly varietal, but not normally identified as such), typically from grapes also used in Germany. The most notable example is Gewurztraminer.\nBeers.\nAlsace is also the main beer-producing region of France, thanks primarily to breweries in and near Strasbourg. These include those of Fischer, Karlsbr\u00e4u, Kronenbourg, and Heineken International. Hops are grown in Kochersberg and in northern Alsace. Schnapps is also traditionally made in Alsace, but it is in decline because home distillers are becoming less common and the consumption of traditional, strong, alcoholic beverages is decreasing.\nSports.\nThe RC Strasbourg Alsace football club has played over 50 seasons in the Ligue 1, with a title in 1978-79. It plays home matches at the Stade de la Meinau, which also hosted two matches at the UEFA Euro 1984. The women's section was promted to the Premi\u00e8re Ligue in 2024.\nThe SIG Strasbourg basketball club has won the LNB \u00c9lite in 2004\u201305.\nThe S\u00e9lestat Alsace handball club has played 23 seasons in LNH Division 1.\nThe \u00c9toile Noire de Strasbourg ice hockey team played in the Ligue Magnus 2006 to 2019.\nThe Internationaux de Strasbourg women's tennis tournament is held since 1987, currently as a WTA 500.\nThe Rallye de France Alsace auto race was held from 2010 to 2014 as part of the World Rally Championship. Also, the Anneau du Rhin racetrack hosted the World Touring Car Cup in 2022.\nIn tales.\nThe stork is a main feature of Alsace and was the subject of many legends told to children. The bird practically disappeared around 1970, but re-population efforts are continuing. They are mostly found on roofs of houses, churches and other public buildings in Alsace.\nThe Easter Bunny was first mentioned in Georg Franck von Franckenau's \"De ovis paschalibus\" (About Easter eggs) in 1682 referring to an Alsace tradition of an Easter Hare bringing Easter eggs.\nThe term \"Alsatia\".\n\"Alsatia\", the Latin form of Alsace's name, entered the English language as \"a lawless place\" or \"a place under no jurisdiction\" prior to the 17th century as a reflection of the British perception of the region at that time. It was used into the 20th century as a term for a ramshackle marketplace, \"protected by ancient custom and the independence of their patrons\". The word is still in use in the 21st century among the English and Australian judiciaries to describe a place where the law cannot reach: \"In setting up the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the state has set out to create an Alsatia \u2013 a region of executive action free of judicial oversight,\" Lord Justice Sedley in UMBS v SOCA 2007.\nDerived from the above, \"Alsatia\" was historically a cant term for the area near Whitefriars, London, which was for a long time a sanctuary. It is first known in print in the title of \"The Squire of Alsatia\", a 1688 play written by Thomas Shadwell.\nEconomy.\nAccording to the \"Institut National de la Statistique et des \u00c9tudes \u00c9conomiques\" (INSEE), Alsace had a gross domestic product of 44.3\u00a0billion euros in 2002. With a GDP per capita of \u20ac24,804, it is the second \"r\u00e9gion\" of France, after only \u00cele-de-France, and 68% of Alsatian jobs are in the services, and 25% are in industry, which makes Alsace one of France's most industrialised \"r\u00e9gions\".\nAlsace is a \"r\u00e9gion\" of varied economic activity, including:\nAlsace has many international ties and 35% of firms are foreign companies (notably German, Swiss, American, Japanese, and Scandinavian).\nTourism.\nHaving been early and always densely populated, Alsace is famous for its high number of picturesque villages, churches and castles and for the various beauties of its three main towns, in spite of severe destructions suffered throughout five centuries of wars between France and Germany.\nAlsace is furthermore famous for its vineyards (especially along the 170\u00a0km of the \"Route des Vins d'Alsace\" from Marlenheim to Thann) and the Vosges mountains with their thick and green forests and picturesque lakes.\nTransportation.\nRoads.\nMost major car journeys are made on the A35 autoroute, which links Saint-Louis on the Swiss border to Lauterbourg on the German border.\nThe A4 toll road (towards Paris) begins northwest of Strasbourg and the A36 toll road towards Lyon, begins west from Mulhouse.\nSpaghetti junctions (built in the 1970s and 1980s) are prominent in the comprehensive system of motorways in Alsace, especially in the outlying areas of Strasbourg and Mulhouse. These cause a major buildup of traffic and are the main sources of pollution in the towns, notably in Strasbourg where the motorway traffic of the A35 was 170,000 per day in 2002.\nAt present, plans are being considered for building a new dual carriageway west of Strasbourg, which would reduce the buildup of traffic in that area by picking up north and southbound vehicles and getting rid of the buildup outside Strasbourg. The line plans to link up the interchange of H\u0153rdt to the north of Strasbourg, with Innenheim in the southwest. The opening is envisaged at the end of 2011, with an average usage of 41,000 vehicles a day. Estimates of the French Works Commissioner however, raised some doubts over the interest of such a project, since it would pick up only about 10% of the traffic of the A35 at Strasbourg. Paradoxically, this reversed the situation of the 1950s. At that time, the French trunk road left of the Rhine not been built, so that traffic would cross into Germany to use the Karlsruhe-Basel Autobahn.\nTo add to the buildup of traffic, the neighbouring German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg has imposed a tax on heavy-goods vehicles using their Autobahnen. Thus, a proportion of the HGVs travelling from north Germany to Switzerland or southern Alsace bypasses the A5 on the Alsace-Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg border and uses the untolled French A35 instead.\nTrains.\nTER Alsace is the rail network serving Alsace. Its network is articulated around the city of Strasbourg. It is one of the most developed rail networks in France, financially sustained partly by the French railroad SNCF, and partly by the \"r\u00e9gion\" Alsace.\nBecause the Vosges are surmountable only by the Col de Saverne and the Belfort Gap, it has been suggested that Alsace needs to open up and get closer to France in terms of its rail links. Developments already under way or planned include:\nHowever, the abandoned Maurice-Lemaire tunnel towards Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges was rebuilt as a toll road.\nWaterways.\nPort traffic of Alsace exceeds 15\u00a0million tonnes, of which about three-quarters is centred on Strasbourg, which is the second busiest French fluvial harbour. The enlargement plan of the Rh\u00f4ne\u2013Rhine Canal, intended to link up the Mediterranean Sea and Central Europe (Rhine, Danube, North Sea and Baltic Sea) was abandoned in 1998 for reasons of expense and land erosion, notably in the Doubs valley.\nAir traffic.\nThere are two international airports in Alsace:\nStrasbourg is also two hours away by road from one of the largest European airports, Frankfurt Main, and 2 hours 30 minutes from Charles de Gaulle Airport through the direct TGV service, stopping in Terminal 2.\nCycling network.\nCrossed by three EuroVelo routes\nAlsace is the most bicycle-friendly region of France, with of cycle routes. The network is of a very good standard and well signposted. All the towpaths of the canals in Alsace (canal des houill\u00e8res de la Sarre, canal de la Marne au Rhin, canal de la Bruche, canal du Rh\u00f4ne au Rhin) are tarred.\nNotable people.\nThe following is a selection of people born in Alsace who have been particularly influential or successful in their respective fields.\nMajor communities.\nGerman original names in brackets if French names differ:\nSister regions.\nThere is an \"accord de coop\u00e9ration internationale\" between Alsace and the following regions:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48130", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48130", "title": "Hare", "text": "Genus of mammals in the family Leporidae\nHares and jackrabbits are mammals belonging to the genus Lepus. They are herbivores and live solitarily or in pairs. They nest in slight depressions called forms, and their young are able to fend for themselves shortly after birth. The genus includes the largest lagomorphs. Most are fast runners with long, powerful hind legs, and large ears that dissipate body heat. Hare species are native to Africa, Eurasia and North America. A hare less than one year old is called a \"leveret\".\nMembers of the \"Lepus\" genus are considered true hares, distinguishing them from rabbits which make up the rest of the Leporidae family. However, there are five leporid species with \"hare\" in their common names which are not considered true hares: the hispid hare (\"Caprolagus hispidus\"), and four species known as red rock hares (\"Pronolagus\"). Conversely, several \"Lepus\" species are called \"jackrabbits\", but classed as hares rather than rabbits. The pet known as the Belgian hare is a domesticated European rabbit which has been selectively bred to resemble a hare.\nBiology.\nHares are swift animals and can run up to over short distances. Over longer distances, the European hare (\"Lepus europaeus\") can run up to . The five species of jackrabbits found in central and western North America are able to run at over longer distances, and can leap up to at a time.\nNormally a shy animal, the European brown hare changes its behavior in spring, when it can be seen in daytime chasing other hares. This appears to be competition between males (called \"bucks\") to attain dominance for breeding. During this spring frenzy, animals of both sexes can be seen \"boxing\", one hare striking another with its paws. This behavior gives rise to the idiom \"mad as a March hare\". This is present not only in intermale competition, but also among females (called \"does\") toward males to prevent copulation.\nHares, like all leporids, have jointed, or kinetic, skulls, unique among mammals. \nDifferences from rabbits.\nHares are generally larger than rabbits, with longer ears, and have black markings on their fur. They have 48 chromosomes, while rabbits have 44. Hares have not been domesticated, while some rabbits are raised for food and kept as pets.\nSome rabbits live and give birth underground in burrows, with many burrows in an area forming a warren. Other rabbits and hares live and give birth in simple forms (shallow depression or flattened nest of grass) above the ground. Hares usually do not live in groups. Young hares are adapted to the lack of physical protection, relative to that afforded by a burrow, by being born fully furred and with eyes open. They are hence precocial, able to fend for themselves soon after birth. By contrast, rabbits are altricial, being born blind and hairless.\nDiet.\nEasily digestible food is processed in the gastrointestinal tract, expelling the waste as regular feces. For nutrients that are harder to extract, hares, like all lagomorphs, ferment fiber in the cecum and expel the mass as cecotropes, which they ingest again, a practice called cecotrophy or refection. The cecotropes are absorbed in the small intestine to use the nutrients.\nHabitat.\nHares can be found in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from desert environments and arctic tundra to temperate grasslands, forests, swamps, mountains, and tropical regions. Some hares such as the snowshoe hare may change their fur color to better hide as the seasons change. The adaptability of the European hare to different environments has led to it becoming an invasive species in regions where it is newly introduced.\nIn human culture.\nFood.\nMeat.\nHares and rabbits are plentiful in many areas, adapt to a wide variety of conditions, and reproduce quickly, so hunting is often less regulated than for other varieties of game. They are a common source of protein worldwide. Because of their extremely low fat content, they are a poor choice as a survival food.\nHares can be prepared in the same manner as rabbits\u2014commonly roasted or parted for breading and frying.\n (also spelled ) is a traditional German stew made from marinated rabbit or hare, seasoned with black pepper (German ) and other spices. Wine or vinegar is also a prominent ingredient, to lend a sourness to the recipe.\n ()\u2014hare stew with pearl onions, vinegar, red wine, and cinnamon\u2014is a much-prized dish enjoyed in Greece and Cyprus and communities in the diaspora.\nThe hare (and in recent times, the rabbit) is a staple of Maltese cuisine. The dish was presented to the island's Grandmasters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, as well as Renaissance Inquisitors resident on the island, several of whom went on to become pope.\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the hare is among mammals deemed not kosher, and therefore not eaten by observant Jews. Muslims deem coney meat (rabbit, pika, hyrax) to be halal, and in Egypt, hare and rabbit are popular meats for \"mulukhiyah\" (jute leaf soup), especially in Cairo.\nBlood.\nThe blood of a freshly killed hare can be collected for consumption in a stew or casserole in a cooking process known as jugging. First the entrails are removed from the hare carcass before it is hung in a larder by its hind legs, which causes blood to accumulate in the chest cavity. One method of preserving the blood after draining it from the hare (since the hare is usually hung for a week or more) is to mix it with red wine vinegar to prevent coagulation, and then to store it in a freezer.\nJugged hare, known as in France, is a whole hare, cut into pieces, marinated, and cooked with red wine and juniper berries in a tall jug that stands in a pan of water. It traditionally is served with the hare's blood (or the blood is added right at the end of the cooking process) and port wine.\nJugged hare is described in an influential 18th-century English cookbook, \"The Art of Cookery\" by Hannah Glasse, with a recipe titled, \"A Jugged Hare\", that begins, \"Cut it into little pieces, lard them here and there\u00a0...\" The recipe goes on to describe cooking the pieces of hare in water in a jug set within a bath of boiling water to cook for three hours. In the 19th century, a myth arose that Glasse's recipe began with the words \"First, catch your hare.\"\nMany other British cookbooks from before the middle of the 20th century have recipes for jugged hare. Merle and Reitch have this to say about jugged hare, for example:\nThe best part of the hare, when roasted, is the loin and the thick part of the hind leg; the other parts are only fit for stewing, hashing, or jugging. It is usual to roast a hare first, and to stew or jug the portion which is not eaten the first day. ...\n\"To Jug A Hare.\" This mode of cooking a hare is very desirable when there is any doubt as to its age, as an old hare, which would be otherwise uneatable, may be made into an agreeable dish.\nIn 2006, a survey of 2021 people for the UKTV Food television channel found only 1.6% of the people under 25 recognized jugged hare by name. Seven of ten stated they would refuse to eat jugged hare if it were served at the house of a friend or a relative.\nIn England, a rarely served dish is potted hare. The hare meat is cooked, then covered in at least one inch (preferably more) of butter. The butter is a preservative (excludes air); the dish can be stored for up to several months. It is served cold, often on bread or as an appetizer.\nTaming.\nNo extant domesticated hares exist. However, hare remains have been found in a wide range of human settlement sites, some showing signs of use beyond simple hunting and eating:\nIn mythology and folklore.\nThe hare in African folk tales is a trickster; some of the stories about the hare were retold among enslaved Africans in America and are the basis of the Br'er Rabbit stories. The hare appears in English folklore in the saying \"as mad as a March hare\" and in the legend of the White Hare that alternatively tells of a witch who takes the form of a white hare and goes out looking for prey at night or of the spirit of a broken-hearted maiden who cannot rest and who haunts her unfaithful lover.\nThe constellation Lepus is taken to represent a hare.\nThe hare was once regarded as an animal sacred to Aphrodite and Eros because of its high libido. Live hares were often presented as a gift of love. In European witchcraft, hares were either witches' familiars or a witch who had transformed themself into a hare. Pop mythology associates the hare with the Anglo-Saxon goddess \u0112ostre as an explanation for the Easter Bunny. However, this belief is modern in origin.\nIn European tradition, the hare symbolises the two qualities of swiftness and timidity. The latter once gave the European hare the Linnaean name \"Lepus timidus\" that is limited to the mountain hare. Several ancient fables depict the Hare in flight: In one, The Hares and the Frogs, they decide to commit mass suicide to relieve the angst of constantly fleeing threats, but reconsider when they startle frogs on the way to throwing themselves into the river. Conversely, in The Tortoise and the Hare, perhaps the best-known among Aesop's Fables, the hare loses a race through being too confident in its swiftness. In Irish folklore, the hare is often associated with the Aos s\u00ed or other pagan elements. In these stories, characters who harm hares often suffer dreadful consequences.\nIn literature and art.\nThree hares.\nA study in 2004 followed the history and migration of a symbolic image of three hares with conjoined ears. In this image, three hares are seen chasing each other in a circle with their heads near its centre. While each of the animals appears to have two ears, only three ears are depicted. The ears form a triangle at the centre of the circle and each is shared by two of the hares. The image has been traced from Christian churches in the English county of Devon right back along the Silk Road to China, via western and eastern Europe and the Middle East. Before its appearance in China, it was possibly first depicted in the Middle East before being reimported centuries later. Its use is associated with Christian, Jewish, Islamic and Buddhist sites stretching back to about 600\u00a0AD.\nPlace names.\nThe hare has given rise to local place names, as they can often be observed in favoured localities. An example in Scotland is \"Murchland\", being a Scots word for a hare.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48132", "revid": "40286053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48132", "title": "Berbers", "text": "Ethnic group indigenous to North Africa\nBerbers, or the Berber peoples, also known as Amazigh or Imazighen, are a diverse grouping of distinct ethnic groups indigenous to North Africa who predate the arrival of Arabs in the Maghreb. Their main connections are identified by their usage of Berber languages, most of them mutually unintelligible, which are part of the Afroasiatic language family.\nThey are indigenous to the Maghreb region of North Africa, where they live in scattered communities across parts of Morocco, Algeria, Libya, and to a lesser extent Tunisia, Mauritania, northern Mali and northern Niger (Azawagh). Smaller Berber communities are also found in Burkina Faso and Egypt's Siwa Oasis.\nDescended from Stone Age cultures indigenous to North Africa, accounts of the Imazighen were first mentioned in Ancient Egyptian writings. From about 2000 BC, Berber languages spread westward from the Nile Valley across the northern Sahara into the Maghreb. A series of Berber peoples such as the Mauri, Masaesyli, Massyli, Musulamii, Gaetuli, and Garamantes gave rise to Berber kingdoms, such as Numidia and Mauretania. Other kingdoms appeared in late antiquity, such as Altava, Aur\u00e8s, Ouarsenis, and Hodna. Berber kingdoms were eventually suppressed by the Arab conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries AD. This started a process of cultural and linguistic assimilation known as Arabization, which influenced the Berber population. Arabization involved the spread of Arabic language and Arab culture among the Berbers, leading to the adoption of Arabic as the primary language and conversion to Islam. Notably, the Arab migrations to the Maghreb from the 7th century to the 17th century accelerated this process. Berber tribes remained powerful political forces and founded new ruling dynasties in the 10th and 11th centuries, such as the Zirids, Hammadids, various Zenata principalities in the western Maghreb, and several Taifa kingdoms in al-Andalus, and empires of the Almoravids and Almohads. Their Berber successors \u2013 the Marinids, the Zayyanids, and the Hafsids \u2013 continued to rule until the 16th century. From the 16th century onward, the process continued in the absence of Berber dynasties; in Morocco, they were replaced by Arabs claiming descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\nBerbers are divided into several diverse ethnic groups and Berber languages, such as Kabyles, Chaouis and Rifians. Historically, Berbers across the region did not see themselves as a single cultural or linguistic unit, nor was there a greater \"Berber community\", due to their differing cultures. They also did not refer to themselves as Berbers/Amazigh but had their own terms to refer to their own groups and communities. They started being referred to collectively as Berbers after the Arab conquests of the 7th century and this distinction was revived by French colonial administrators in the 19th century. Today, the term \"Berber\" is viewed as pejorative by many who prefer the term \"Amazigh\". Since the late 20th century, a trans-national movement \"\u2013\" known as Berberism or the Berber Culture Movement \"\u2013\" has emerged among various parts of the Berber populations of North Africa to promote a collective Amazigh ethnic identity and to militate for greater linguistic rights and cultural recognition.\nNames and etymology.\nThe indigenous populations of the Maghreb region of North Africa are collectively known as Berbers or Amazigh in English.\nTribal titles such as \"Barabara\" and \"Beraberata\" appear in Egyptian inscriptions of 1700 and 1300 BC, and the Berbers were probably intimately related with the Egyptians in very early times. Thus the true ethnic name may have become confused with \"Barbari\", the designation used by classical conquerors.\nThe plural form Imazighen is sometimes also used in English. While \"Berber\" is more widely known among English-speakers, its usage is a subject of debate, due to its historical background as an exonym and present equivalence with the Arabic word for \"barbarian\". Historically, Berbers did not refer to themselves as Berbers/Amazigh but had their own terms to refer to themselves. For example, the Kabyle use the term \"Leqbayel\" to refer to their own people, while the Chaoui identified as \"Ishawiyen\", instead of Berber/Amazigh.\nSt\u00e9phane Gsell proposed the translation \"noble/free\" for the term Amazigh based on Leo Africanus's translation of \"awal amazigh\" as \"noble language\" referring to the Berber languages; this definition remains disputed and is largely seen as an undue extrapolation. The term Amazigh also has a cognate in the Tuareg \"Amajegh\", meaning noble. \"Mazigh\" was used as a tribal surname in Roman Mauretania Caesariensis.\nAbraham Isaac Laredo proposes that the term Amazigh could be derived from \"Mezeg\", which is the name of Dedan of Sheba in the Targum.\nThe medieval Arab historian Ibn Khaldun says the Berbers were descendants of Barbar, the son of Tamalla, son of Mazigh, son of Canaan, son of Ham, son of Noah. \nThe Numidian, Mauri and Libu populations of antiquity are typically understood by contemporary writers to have referred to approximately the same population as modern Berbers.\nHistory.\nThe areas of North Africa that have retained the Berber language and traditions best have been, in general, Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. Much of Berber culture is still celebrated among the cultural elite in Morocco and Algeria, especially in Kabylia, the Aur\u00e8s and the Atlas Mountains. The Kabyles were one of the few peoples in North Africa who remained independent during successive rule by the Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Vandals, and the Ottoman Turks. Even after the Arab conquest of North Africa, the Kabyle people still maintained possession of their mountains.\nPrehistory.\nThe Maghreb region in northwestern Africa is believed to have been inhabited by Berbers from at least 10,000\u00a0BC. Cave paintings, which have been dated to twelve millennia before present, have been found in the Tassili n'Ajjer region of southeastern Algeria. Other rock art has been discovered at Tadrart Acacus in the Libyan desert. A Neolithic society, marked by domestication and subsistence agriculture and richly depicted in the Tassili n'Ajjer paintings, developed and predominated in the Saharan and Mediterranean region (the Maghreb) of northern Africa between 6000 and 2000\u00a0BC (until the classical period).\nPrehistoric Tifinagh inscriptions were found in the Oran region. During the pre-Roman era, several successive independent states (Massylii) existed before King Masinissa unified the people of Numidia.\nMythology.\nAccording to the Roman historian Gaius Sallustius Crispus, the original people of North Africa are the Gaetulians and the Libyans, they were the prehistoric peoples that crossed to Africa from the Iberian Peninsula, then much later, Hercules and his army crossed from Iberia to North Africa where his army intermarried with the local populace and settled the region permanently, the Medes of his army that married the Libyans formed the Maur people, while the other part of his Army formed the Nomadas or as they are today known as the Numidians which later on united all of Berber tribes of North Africa under the rule of Massinissa.\nOther sources.\nAccording to the \"Al-Fi\u1e25rist\", the Barber (i.e. Berbers) comprised one of seven principal races in Africa.\nThe medieval Tunisian scholar Ibn Khaldun (1332\u20131406), recounting the oral traditions prevalent in his day, sets down two popular opinions as to the origin of the Berbers: according to one opinion, they are descended from Canaan, son of Ham, and have for ancestors Berber, son of Temla, son of Maz\u00eegh, son of Canaan, son of Ham, a son of Noah; alternatively, Abou-Bekr Mohammed es-Souli (947 AD) held that they are descended from Berber, the son of Keloudjm (Casluhim), the son of Mesraim, the son of Ham.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They belong to a powerful, formidable, brave and numerous people; a true people like so many others the world has seen \u2013 like the Arabs, the Persians, the Greeks and the Romans. The men who belong to this family of peoples have inhabited the Maghreb since the beginning.\nAncestry and DNA.\nAs of about 5000 BC, the populations of North Africa were descended primarily from the Iberomaurusian and Capsian cultures, with a more recent intrusion being associated with the Neolithic Revolution. The proto-Berber tribes evolved from these prehistoric communities during the late Bronze- and early Iron ages.\nUniparental DNA analysis has established ties between Berbers and other Afroasiatic speakers in Africa. Most of these populations belong to the E1b1b paternal haplogroup, with Berber speakers having among the highest frequencies of this lineage.\nAdditionally, genomic analysis found that Berber and other Maghreb communities have a high frequency of an ancestral component that originated in the Near East. This Maghrebi element peaks among Tunisian Berbers. This ancestry is related to the Coptic/Ethio-Somali component, which diverged from these and other West Eurasian-affiliated components before the Holocene.\nIn 2013, Iberomaurusian skeletons from the prehistoric sites of Taforalt and Afalou in the Maghreb were also analyzed for ancient DNA. All of the specimens belonged to maternal clades associated with either North Africa or the northern and southern Mediterranean littoral, indicating gene flow between these areas since the Epipaleolithic. The ancient Taforalt individuals carried the mtDNA haplogroups U6, H, JT, and V, which points to population continuity in the region dating from the Iberomaurusian period.\nHuman fossils excavated at the Ifri n'Amr ou Moussa site in Morocco have been radiocarbon dated to the Early Neolithic period, c.\u20095000 BC. Ancient DNA analysis of these specimens indicates that they carried paternal haplotypes related to the E1b1b1b1a (E-M81) subclade and the maternal haplogroups U6a and M1, all of which are frequent among present-day communities in the Maghreb. These ancient individuals also bore an autochthonous Maghrebi genomic component that peaks among modern Berbers, indicating that they were ancestral to populations in the area. Additionally, fossils excavated at the Kelif el Boroud site near Rabat were found to carry the broadly distributed paternal haplogroup T-M184 as well as the maternal haplogroups K1, T2 and X2, the latter of which were common mtDNA lineages in Neolithic Europe and Anatolia. These ancient individuals likewise bore the Berber-associated Maghrebi genomic component. This altogether indicates that the late-Neolithic Kehf el Baroud inhabitants were ancestral to contemporary populations in the area, but also likely experienced gene flow from Europe.\nThe late-Neolithic Kehf el Baroud inhabitants were modelled as being of about 50% local North African ancestry and 50% Early European Farmer (EEF) ancestry. It was suggested that EEF ancestry had entered North Africa through Cardial Ware colonists from Iberia sometime between 5000 and 3000 BC. They were found to be closely related to the Guanches of the Canary Islands. The authors of the study suggested that the Berbers of Morocco carried a substantial amount of EEF ancestry before the establishment of Roman colonies in Berber Africa.\nAntiquity.\nThe great tribes of Berbers in classical antiquity (when they were often known as ancient Libyans) were said to be three (roughly, from west to east): the Mauri, the Numidians near Carthage, and the Gaetulians. The Mauri inhabited the far west (ancient Mauretania, now Morocco and central Algeria). The Numidians occupied the regions between the Mauri and the city-state of Carthage. Both the Mauri and the Numidians had significant sedentary populations living in villages, and their peoples both tilled the land and tended herds. The Gaetulians lived to the near south, on the northern margins of the Sahara, and were less settled, with predominantly pastoral elements.41f\nFor their part, the Phoenicians (Semitic-speaking Canaanites) came from perhaps the most advanced multicultural sphere then existing, the western coast of the Fertile Crescent region of West Asia. Accordingly, the material culture of Phoenicia was likely more functional and efficient, and their knowledge more advanced, than that of the early Berbers. Hence, the interactions between Berbers and Phoenicians were often asymmetrical. The Phoenicians worked to keep their cultural cohesion and ethnic solidarity, and continuously refreshed their close connection with Tyre, the mother city.37\nThe earliest Phoenician coastal outposts were probably meant merely to resupply and service ships bound for the lucrative metals trade with the Iberians, and perhaps at first regarded trade with the Berbers as unprofitable. However, the Phoenicians eventually established strategic colonial cities in many Berber areas, including sites outside of present-day Tunisia, such as the settlements at Oea, Leptis Magna, Sabratha (in Libya), Volubilis, Chellah, and Mogador (now in Morocco). As in Tunisia, these centres were trading hubs, and later offered support for resource development, such as processing olive oil at Volubilis and Tyrian purple dye at Mogador. For their part, most Berbers maintained their independence as farmers or semi-pastorals, although, due to the example of Carthage, their organized politics increased in scope and sophistication.\nIn fact, for a time their numerical and military superiority (the best horse riders of that time) enabled some Berber kingdoms to impose a tribute on Carthage, a condition that continued into the 5th century BC.64\u201365 Also, due to the Berbero-Libyan Meshwesh dynasty's rule of Egypt (945\u2013715 BC), the Berbers near Carthage commanded significant respect (yet probably appearing more rustic than the elegant Libyan pharaohs on the Nile). Correspondingly, in early Carthage, careful attention was given to securing the most favourable treaties with the Berber chieftains, \"which included intermarriage between them and the Punic aristocracy\". In this regard, perhaps the legend about Dido, the foundress of Carthage, as related by Trogus is apposite. Her refusal to wed the Mauritani chieftain Hiarbus might be indicative of the complexity of the politics involved.\nEventually, the Phoenician trading stations would evolve into permanent settlements, and later into small towns, which would presumably require a wide variety of goods as well as sources of food, which could be satisfied through trade with the Berbers. Yet, here too, the Phoenicians probably would be drawn into organizing and directing such local trade, and also into managing agricultural production. In the 5th century BC, Carthage expanded its territory, acquiring Cape Bon and the fertile Wadi Majardah, later establishing control over productive farmlands for several hundred kilometres. Appropriation of such wealth in land by the Phoenicians would surely provoke some resistance from the Berbers; although in warfare, too, the technical training, social organization, and weaponry of the Phoenicians would seem to work against the tribal Berbers. This social-cultural interaction in early Carthage has been summarily described:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Lack of contemporary written records makes the drawing of conclusions here uncertain, which can only be based on inference and reasonable conjecture about matters of social nuance. Yet it appears that the Phoenicians generally did not interact with the Berbers as economic equals, but employed their agricultural labour, and their household services, whether by hire or indenture; many became sharecroppers.86\nFor a period, the Berbers were in constant revolt, and in 396 there was a great uprising.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Thousands of rebels streamed down from the mountains and invaded Punic territory, carrying the serfs of the countryside along with them. The Carthaginians were obliged to withdraw within their walls and were besieged.\nYet the Berbers lacked cohesion; and although 200,000 strong at one point, they succumbed to hunger, their leaders were offered bribes, and \"they gradually broke up and returned to their homes\".125, 172 Thereafter, \"a series of revolts took place among the Libyans [Berbers] from the fourth century onwards\".81\nThe Berbers had become involuntary 'hosts' to the settlers from the east, and were obliged to accept the dominance of Carthage for centuries. Nonetheless, therein they persisted largely unassimilated, as a separate, submerged entity, as a culture of mostly passive urban and rural poor within the civil structures created by Punic rule. In addition, and most importantly, the Berber peoples also formed quasi-independent satellite societies along the steppes of the frontier and beyond, where a minority continued as free 'tribal republics'. While benefiting from Punic material culture and political-military institutions, these peripheral Berbers (also called Libyans)\u2014while maintaining their own identity, culture, and traditions\u2014continued to develop their own agricultural skills and village societies, while living with the newcomers from the east in an asymmetric symbiosis.\nAs the centuries passed, a society of Punic people of Phoenician descent but born in Africa, called emerged there. This term later came to be applied also to Berbers acculturated to urban Phoenician culture.65, 84\u201386 Yet the whole notion of a Berber apprenticeship to the Punic civilization has been called an exaggeration sustained by a point of view fundamentally foreign to the Berbers.52, 58 A population of mixed ancestry, Berber and Punic, evolved there, and there would develop recognized niches in which Berbers had proven their utility. For example, the Punic state began to field Berber\u2013Numidian cavalry under their commanders on a regular basis. The Berbers eventually were required to provide soldiers (at first \"unlikely\" paid \"except in booty\"), which by the fourth century BC became \"the largest single element in the Carthaginian army\".86\nYet in times of stress at Carthage, when a foreign force might be pushing against the city-state, some Berbers would see it as an opportunity to advance their interests, given their otherwise low status in Punic society. Thus, when the Greeks under Agathocles (361\u2013289 BC) of Sicily landed at Cape Bon and threatened Carthage (in 310 BC), there were Berbers, under Ailymas, who went over to the invading Greeks.172 During the long Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC) with Rome (see below), the Berber King Masinissa (c.\u2009240\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009148 BC) joined with the invading Roman general Scipio, resulting in the war-ending defeat of Carthage at Zama, despite the presence of their renowned general Hannibal; on the other hand, the Berber King Syphax (d. 202 BC) had supported Carthage. The Romans, too, read these cues, so that they cultivated their Berber alliances and, subsequently, favored the Berbers who advanced their interests following the Roman victory.\nCarthage was faulted by her ancient rivals for the \"harsh treatment of her subjects\" as well as for \"greed and cruelty\".83 Her Libyan Berber sharecroppers, for example, were required to pay half of their crops as tribute to the city-state during the emergency of the First Punic War. The normal exaction taken by Carthage was likely \"an extremely burdensome\" one-quarter.80 Carthage once famously attempted to reduce the number of its Libyan and foreign soldiers, leading to the Mercenary War (240\u2013237 BC).203\u2013209 The city-state also seemed to reward those leaders known to deal ruthlessly with its subject peoples, hence the frequent Berber insurrections. Moderns fault Carthage for failure \"to bind her subjects to herself, as Rome did [her Italians]\", yet Rome and the Italians held far more in common perhaps than did Carthage and the Berbers. Nonetheless, a modern criticism is that the Carthaginians \"did themselves a disservice\" by failing to promote the common, shared quality of \"life in a properly organized city\" that inspires loyalty, particularly with regard to the Berbers.86\u201387 Again, the tribute demanded by Carthage was onerous.\n[T]he most ruinous tribute was imposed and exacted with unsparing rigour from the subject native states, and no slight one either from the cognate Phoenician states. ... Hence arose that universal disaffection, or rather that deadly hatred, on the part of her foreign subjects, and even of the Phoenician dependencies, toward Carthage, on which every invader of Africa could safely count as his surest support. ... This was the fundamental, the ineradicable weakness of the Carthaginian Empire\u00a0...\nThe Punic relationship with the majority of the Berbers continued throughout the life of Carthage. The unequal development of material culture and social organization perhaps fated the relationship to be an uneasy one. A long-term cause of Punic instability, there was no melding of the peoples. It remained a source of stress and a point of weakness for Carthage. Yet there were degrees of convergence on several particulars, discoveries of mutual advantage, occasions of friendship, and family.\nThe Berbers gain historicity gradually during the Roman era. Byzantine authors mention the (Amazigh) as tribal people raiding the monasteries of Cyrenaica. Garamantia was a notable Berber kingdom that flourished in the Fezzan area of modern-day Libya in the Sahara desert between 400 BC and 600 AD.\nRoman-era Cyrenaica became a center of early Christianity. Some pre-Islamic Berbers were Christians (there is a strong correlation between adherence to the Donatist doctrine and being a Berber, ascribed to the doctrine matching their culture, as well as their being alienated from the dominant Roman culture of the Catholic church), some perhaps Jewish, and some adhered to their traditional polytheist religion. The Roman-era authors Apuleius and St. Augustine were born in Numidia, as were three popes, one of whom, Pope Victor I, served during the reign of Roman emperor Septimius Severus, who was a North African of Roman/Punic ancestry (perhaps with some Berber blood).\nNumidia.\nNumidia (202\u00a0\u2013 46 BC) was an ancient Berber kingdom in modern Algeria and part of Tunisia. It later alternated between being a Roman province and being a Roman client state. The kingdom was located on the eastern border of modern Algeria, bordered by the Roman province of Mauretania (in modern Algeria and Morocco) to the west, the Roman province of Africa (modern Tunisia) to the east, the Mediterranean to the north, and the Sahara Desert to the south. Its people were the Numidians.\nThe name was first applied by Polybius and other historians during the third century BC to indicate the territory west of Carthage, including the entire north of Algeria as far as the river Mulucha (Muluya), about west of Oran. The Numidians were conceived of as two great groups: the Massylii in eastern Numidia, and the Masaesyli in the west. During the first part of the Second Punic War, the eastern Massylii, under King Gala, were allied with Carthage, while the western Masaesyli, under King Syphax, were allied with Rome.\nIn 206 BC, the new king of the Massylii, Masinissa, allied himself with Rome, and Syphax, of the Masaesyli, switched his allegiance to the Carthaginian side. At the end of the war, the victorious Romans gave all of Numidia to Masinissa. At the time of his death in 148 BC, Masinissa's territory extended from Mauretania to the boundary of Carthaginian territory, and southeast as far as Cyrenaica, so that Numidia entirely surrounded Carthage except towards the sea.\nMasinissa was succeeded by his son Micipsa. When Micipsa died in 118 BC, he was succeeded jointly by his two sons Hiempsal I and Adherbal and Masinissa's illegitimate grandson, Jugurtha, of Berber origin, who was very popular among the Numidians. Hiempsal and Jugurtha quarreled immediately after the death of Micipsa. Jugurtha had Hiempsal killed, which led to open war with Adherbal.\nAfter Jugurtha defeated him in open battle, Adherbal fled to Rome for help. The Roman officials, allegedly due to bribes but perhaps more likely out of a desire to quickly end conflict in a profitable client kingdom, sought to settle the quarrel by dividing Numidia into two parts. Jugurtha was assigned the western half. However, soon after, conflict broke out again, leading to the Jugurthine War between Rome and Numidia.\nMauretania.\nIn antiquity, Mauretania (3rd century BC\u00a0\u2013 44 BC) was an ancient Mauri Berber kingdom in modern Morocco and part of Algeria. It became a client state of the Roman empire in 33 BC, after the death of king Bocchus II, then a full Roman province in AD 40, after the death of its last king, Ptolemy of Mauretania, a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty.\nMiddle Ages.\nAccording to historians of the Middle Ages, the Berbers were divided into two branches, Butr and Baranis (known also as Botr and Barn\u00e8s), descended from Mazigh ancestors, who were themselves divided into tribes and subtribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several fully independent tribes (e.g., Sanhaja, Houaras, Zenata, Masmuda, Kutama, Awraba, Barghawata, etc.).\nThe Mauro-Roman Kingdom was an independent Christian Berber kingdom centred in the capital city of Altava (present-day Algeria) which controlled much of the ancient Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis. Berber Christian communities within the Maghreb all but disappeared under Islamic rule. The indigenous Christian population in some Nefzaoua villages persisted until the 14th century.\nSeveral Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and al-Andalus. The most notable are the Zirids (Ifriqiya, 973\u20131148), the Hammadids (Western Ifriqiya, 1014\u20131152), the Almoravid dynasty (Morocco and al-Andalus, 1040\u20131147), the Almohads (Morocco and al-Andalus, 1147\u20131248), the Hafsids (Ifriqiya, 1229\u20131574), the Zianids (Tlemcen, 1235\u20131556), the Marinids (Morocco, 1248\u20131465) and the Wattasids (Morocco, 1471\u20131554).\nBefore the eleventh century, most of Northwest Africa had become a Berber-speaking Muslim area. Unlike the conquests of previous religions and cultures, the spread of Islam, which was spread by Arabs, was to have extensive and long-lasting effects on the Maghreb. The new faith, in its various forms, would penetrate nearly all segments of Berber society, bringing with it armies, learned men, and fervent mystics, and in large part replacing tribal practices and loyalties with new social norms and political idioms. A further Arabization of the region was in large part due to the arrival of the Banu Hilal, a tribe sent by the Fatimids of Egypt to punish the Berber Zirid dynasty for having abandoned Shiism. The Banu Hilal reduced the Zirids to a few coastal towns and took over much of the plains, resulting in the spread of nomadism to areas where agriculture had previously been dominant.\nBesides the Arabian influence, North Africa also saw an influx, via the Barbary slave trade, of Europeans, with some estimates placing the number of European slaves brought to North Africa during the Ottoman period to be as high as 1.25\u00a0million. Interactions with neighboring Sudanic empires, traders, and nomads from other parts of Africa also left impressions upon the Berber people.\nIslamic conquest.\nThe first Arabian military expeditions into the Maghreb, between 642 and 669, resulted in the spread of Islam. These early forays from a base in Egypt occurred under local initiative rather than under orders from the central caliphate. But when the seat of the caliphate moved from Medina to Damascus, the Umayyads (a Muslim dynasty ruling from 661 to 750) recognized that the strategic necessity of dominating the Mediterranean dictated a concerted military effort on the North African front. In 670, therefore, an Arab army under Uqba ibn Nafi established the town of Qayrawan about 160 kilometres south of modern Tunis and used it as a base for further operations.\nAbu al-Muhajir Dinar, Uqba's successor, pushed westward into Algeria and eventually worked out a modus vivendi with Kusaila, the ruler of an extensive confederation of Christian Berbers. Kusaila, who had been based in Tlemcen, became a Muslim and moved his headquarters to Takirwan, near Al Qayrawan. This harmony was short-lived; Arabian and Berber forces controlled the region in turn until 697. Umayyad forces conquered Carthage in 698, expelling the Byzantines, and in 703 decisively defeated Dihya's Berber coalition at the Battle of Tabarka. By 711, Umayyad forces helped by Berber converts to Islam had conquered all of North Africa. Governors appointed by the Umayyad caliphs ruled from Kairouan, capital of the new wilaya (province) of Ifriqiya, which covered Tripolitania (the western part of modern Libya), Tunisia, and eastern Algeria.\nThe spread of Islam among the Berbers did not guarantee their support for the Arab-dominated caliphate, due to the discriminatory attitude of the Arabs. The ruling Arabs alienated the Berbers by taxing them heavily, treating converts as second-class Muslims, and, worst of all, by enslaving them. As a result, widespread opposition took the form of open revolt in 739\u2013740 under the banner of Ibadi Islam. The Ibadi had been fighting Umayyad rule in the East, and many Berbers were attracted by the sect's seemingly egalitarian precepts.\nAfter the revolt, Ibadis established a number of theocratic tribal kingdoms, most of which had short and troubled histories. But others, such as Sijilmasa and Tlemcen, which straddled the principal trade routes, proved more viable and prospered. In 750, the Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads as Muslim rulers, moved the caliphate to Baghdad and reestablished caliphal authority in Ifriqiya, appointing Ibrahim ibn al Aghlab as governor in Kairouan. Though nominally serving at the caliph's pleasure, Al Aghlab and his successors, the Aghlabids, ruled independently until 909, presiding over a court that became a center of learning and culture.\nJust to the west of Aghlabid lands, Abd ar Rahman ibn Rustam ruled most of the central Maghreb from Tahert, south-west of Algiers. The rulers of the Rustamid imamate (761\u2013909), each an Ibadi imam, were elected by leading citizens. The imams gained a reputation for honesty, piety, and justice. The court at Tahert was noted for its support of scholarship in mathematics, astronomy, astrology, theology, and law. The Rustamid imams failed, by choice or by neglect, to organize a reliable standing army. This important factor, accompanied by the dynasty's eventual collapse into decadence, opened the way for Tahert's demise under the assault of the Fatimids.\nMahdia was founded by the Fatimids under the Caliph Abdallah al-Mahdi in 921, and made the capital city of Ifriqiya by caliph Abdallah El Fatimi. It was chosen as the capital because of its proximity to the sea, and the promontory on which an important military settlement had been since the time of the Phoenicians.\nIn al-Andalus under the Umayyad governors.\nThe Muslims who invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 711 were mainly Berbers, and were led by a Berber, Tariq ibn Ziyad, under the suzerainty of the Arab Caliph of Damascus Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan and his North African Viceroy, Musa ibn Nusayr. Due to subsequent antagonism between Arabs and Berbers, and due to the fact that most of the histories of al-Andalus were written from an Arab perspective, the Berber role is understated in the available sources. The biographical dictionary of Ibn Khallikan preserves the record of the Berber predominance in the invasion of 711, in the entry on Tariq ibn Ziyad. A second mixed army of Arabs and Berbers came in 712 under Ibn Nusayr himself. They supposedly helped the Umayyad caliph Abd ar-Rahman I in al-Andalus, because his mother was a Berber.\nEnglish medievalist Roger Collins suggests that if the forces that invaded the Iberian peninsula were predominantly Berber, it is because there were insufficient Arab forces in Africa to maintain control of Africa and attack Iberia at the same time.98 Thus, although north Africa had only been conquered about a dozen years previously, the Arabs already employed forces of the defeated Berbers to carry out their next invasion.98 This would explain the predominance of Berbers over Arabs in the initial invasion. In addition, Collins argues that Berber social organization made it possible for the Arabs to recruit entire tribal units into their armies, making the defeated Berbers excellent military auxiliaries.99 The Berber forces in the invasion of Iberia came from Ifriqiya or as far away as Tripolitania.\nGovernor As-Samh distributed land to the conquering forces, apparently by tribe, though it is difficult to determine from the few historical sources available.48\u201349 It was at this time that the positions of Arabs and Berbers were regularized across the Iberian peninsula. Berbers were positioned in many of the most mountainous regions of Spain, such as Granada, the Pyrenees, Cantabria, and Galicia. Collins suggests this may be because some Berbers were familiar with mountain terrain, whereas the Arabs were not.49\u201350 By the late 710s, there was a Berber governor in Leon or Gijon.149 When Pelagius revolted in Asturias, it was against a Berber governor. This revolt challenged As-Samh's plans to settle Berbers in the Galician and Cantabrian mountains, and by the middle of the eighth century it seems there was no more Berber presence in Galicia.49\u201350 The expulsion of the Berber garrisons from central Asturias, following the battle of Covadonga, contributed to the eventual formation of the independent Asturian kingdom.63\nMany Berbers were settled in what were then the frontier lands near Toledo, Talavera, and M\u00e9rida,195 M\u00e9rida becoming a major Berber stronghold in the eighth century.201 The Berber garrison in Talavera would later be commanded by Amrus ibn Yusuf and was involved in military operations against rebels in Toledo in the late 700s and early 800s.210 Berbers were also initially settled in the eastern Pyrenees and Catalonia.88\u201389, 195 They were not settled in the major cities of the south, and were generally kept in the frontier zones away from Cordoba.207\nRoger Collins cites the work of Pierre Guichard to argue that Berber groups in Iberia retained their own distinctive social organization.90 According to this traditional view of Arab and Berber culture in the Iberian peninsula, Berber society was highly impermeable to outside influences, whereas Arabs became assimilated and Hispanized.90 Some support for the view that Berbers assimilated less comes from an excavation of an Islamic cemetery in northern Spain, which reveals that the Berbers accompanying the initial invasion brought their families with them from north Africa.\nIn 731, the eastern Pyrenees were under the control of Berber forces garrisoned in the major towns under the command of Munnuza. Munnuza attempted a Berber uprising against the Arabs in Spain, citing mistreatment of Berbers by Arabic judges in north Africa, and made an alliance with Duke Eudo of Aquitaine. However, governor Abd ar-Rahman attacked Munnuza before he was ready, and, besieging him, defeated him at Cerdanya. Because of the alliance with Munnuza, Abd ar-Rahman wanted to punish Eudo, and his punitive expedition ended in the Arab defeat at Poitiers.88\u201390\nBy the time of the governor Uqba, and possibly as early as 714, the city of Pamplona was occupied by a Berber garrison.205\u2013206 An eighth-century cemetery has been discovered with 190 burials all according to Islamic custom, testifying to the presence of this garrison.205\u2013206 In 798, however, Pamplona is recorded as being under a Banu Qasi governor, Mutarrif ibn Musa. Ibn Musa lost control of Pamplona to a popular uprising. In 806 Pamplona gave its allegiance to the Franks, and in 824 became the independent Kingdom of Pamplona. These events put an end to the Berber garrison in Pamplona.206\u2013208\nMedieval Egyptian historian Al-Hakam wrote that there was a major Berber revolt in north Africa in 740\u2013741, led by Masayra. The \"Chronicle of 754\" calls these rebels Arures, which Collins translates as 'heretics', arguing it is a reference to the Berber rebels' Ibadi or Khariji sympathies.107 After Charles Martel attacked Arab ally Maurontus at Marseille in 739, governor Uqba planned a punitive attack against the Franks, but news of a Berber revolt in north Africa made him turn back when he reached Zaragoza.92 Instead, according to the \"Chronicle of 754\", Uqba carried out an attack against Berber fortresses in Africa. Initially, these attacks were unsuccessful; but eventually Uqba destroyed the rebels, secured all the crossing points to Spain, and then returned to his governorship.105\u2013106\nAlthough Masayra was killed by his own followers, the revolt spread and the Berber rebels defeated three Arab armies.106\u2013108 After the defeat of the third army, which included elite units of Syrians commanded by Kulthum and Balj, the Berber revolt spread further. At this time, the Berber military colonies in Spain revolted.108 At the same time, Uqba died and was replaced by Ibn Qatan. By this time, the Berbers controlled most of the north of the Iberian peninsula, except for the Ebro valley, and were menacing Toledo. Ibn Qatan invited Balj and his Syrian troops, who were at that time in Ceuta, to cross to the Iberian peninsula to fight against the Berbers.109\u2013110\nThe Berbers marched south in three columns, simultaneously attacking Toledo, Cordoba, and the ports on the Gibraltar strait. However, Ibn Qatan's sons defeated the army attacking Toledo, the governor's forces defeated the attack on Cordoba, and Balj defeated the attack on the strait. After this, Balj seized power by marching on Cordoba and executing Ibn Qatan.108 Collins points out that Balj's troops were away from Syria just when the Abbasid revolt against the Umayyads broke out, and this may have contributed to the fall of the Umayyad regime.121\nIn Africa, the Berbers were hampered by divided leadership. Their attack on Kairouan was defeated, and a new governor of Africa, Hanzala ibn Safwan, proceeded to defeat the rebels in Africa and then to impose peace between Balj's troops and the existing Andalusi Arabs.110\u2013111\nRoger Collins argues that the Great Berber revolt facilitated the establishment of the Kingdom of Asturias and altered the demographics of the Berber population in the Iberian peninsula, specifically contributing to the Berber departure from the northwest of the peninsula.150\u2013151 When the Arabs first invaded the peninsula, Berber groups were situated in the northwest. However, due to the Berber revolt, the Umayyad governors were forced to protect their southern flank and were unable to mount an offense against the Asturians. Some presence of Berbers in the northwest may have been maintained at first, but after the 740s there is no more mention of the northwestern Berbers in the sources.150\u2013151, 153\u2013154\nIn al-Andalus during the Umayyad emirate.\nWhen the Umayyad Caliphate was overthrown in 750, a grandson of Caliph Hisham, Abd ar-Rahman, escaped to north Africa115 and hid among the Berbers of north Africa for five years. A persistent tradition states that this is because his mother was Berber117\u2013118 and that he first took refuge with the Nafsa Berbers, his mother's people. As the governor Ibn Habib was seeking him, he then fled to the more powerful Zenata Berber confederacy, who were enemies of Ibn Habib. Since the Zenata had been part of the initial invasion force of al-Andalus, and were still present in the Iberian peninsula, this gave Abd ar-Rahman a base of support in al-Andalus,119 although he seems to have drawn most of his support from portions of Balj's army that were still loyal to the Umayyads.122\u20131238\nAbd ar-Rahman crossed to Spain in 756 and declared himself the legitimate Umayyad ruler of al-Andalus. The governor, Yusuf, refused to submit. After losing the initial battle near Cordoba,124\u2013125 Yusuf fled to M\u00e9rida, where he raised a large Berber army, with which he marched on Seville, but was defeated by forces loyal to Abd ar-Rahman. Yusuf fled to Toledo, and was killed either on the way or after reaching that place.132 Yusuf's cousin Hisham ibn Urwa continued to resist Abd ar-Rahman from Toledo until 764,133 and the sons of Yusuf revolted again in 785. These family members of Yusuf, members of the Fihri tribe, were effective in obtaining support from Berbers in their revolts against the Umayyad regime.134\nAs emir of al-Andalus, Abd ar-Rahman I faced persistent opposition from Berber groups, including the Zenata. Berbers provided much of Yusuf's support in fighting Abd ar-Rahman. In 774, Zenata Berbers were involved in a Yemeni revolt in the area of Seville.168 Andalusi Berber Salih ibn Tarif declared himself a prophet and ruled the Bargawata Berber confederation in Morocco in the 770s.169\nIn 768, a Miknasa Berber named Shaqya ibn Abd al-Walid declared himself a Fatimid imam, claiming descent from Fatimah and Ali.168 He is mainly known from the work of the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir,170 who wrote that Shaqya's revolt originated in the area of modern Cuenca, an area of Spain that is mountainous and difficult to traverse. Shaqya first killed the Umayyad governor of the fortress of Santaver (near Roman Ercavica), and subsequently ravaged the district surrounding Coria. Abd ar-Rahman sent out armies to fight him in 769, 770, and 771; but Shaqya avoided them by moving into the mountains. In 772, Shaqya defeated an Umayyad force by a ruse and killed the governor of the fortress of Medellin. He was besieged by Umayyads in 774, but the revolt near Seville forced the besieging troops to withdraw. In 775, a Berber garrison in Coria declared allegiance to Shaqya, but Abd ar-Rahman retook the town and chased the Berbers into the mountains. In 776, Shaqya resisted sieges of his two main fortresses at Santaver and Shebat'ran (near Toledo); but in 777 he was betrayed and killed by his own followers, who sent his head to Abd ar-Rahman.170\u2013171\nRoger Collins notes that both modern historians and ancient Arab authors have had a tendency to portray Shaqya as a fanatic followed by credulous fanatics, and to argue that he was either self-deluded or fraudulent in his claim of Fatimid descent.169 However, Collins considers him an example of the messianic leaders that were not uncommon among Berbers at that time and earlier. He compares Shaqya to Idris I, a descendant of Ali accepted by the Zenata Berbers, who founded the Idrisid dynasty in 788, and to Salih ibn Tarif, who ruled the Bargawata Berber in the 770s. He also compares these leaders to pre-Islamic leaders Dihya and Kusaila.169\u2013170\nIn 788, Hisham I succeeded Abd ar-Rahman as emir; but his brother Sulayman revolted and fled to the Berber garrison of Valencia, where he held out for two years. Finally, Sulayman came to terms with Hisham and went into exile in 790, together with other brothers who had rebelled with him.203, 208 In north Africa, Sulayman and his brothers forged alliances with local Berbers, especially the Kharijite ruler of Tahert. After the death of Hisham and the accession of Al-Hakam, Hisham's brothers challenged Al-Hakam for the succession. Abd Allah crossed over to Valencia first in 796, calling on the allegiance of the same Berber garrison that sheltered Sulayman years earlier.30 Crossing to al-Andalus in 798, Sulayman based himself in Elvira (now Granada), Ecija, and Jaen, apparently drawing support from the Berbers in these mountainous southern regions. Sulayman was defeated in battle in 800 and fled to the Berber stronghold in M\u00e9rida, but was captured before reaching it and executed in Cordoba.208\nIn 797, the Berbers of Talavera played a major part in defeating a revolt against Al-Hakam in Toledo.32 A certain Ubayd Allah ibn Hamir of Toledo rebelled against Al-Hakam, who ordered Amrus ibn Yusuf, the commander of the Berbers in Talavera, to suppress the rebellion. Amrus negotiated in secret with the Banu Mahsa faction in Toledo, promising them the governorship if they betrayed Ibn Hamir. The Banu Mahsa brought Ibn Hamir's head to Amrus in Talavera. However, there was a feud between the Banu Mahsa and the Berbers of Talavera, who killed all the Banu Mahsa. Amrus sent the heads of the Banu Mahsa along with that of Ibn Hamir to Al-Hakam in Cordoba. The Toledo rebellion was sufficiently weakened that Amrus was able to enter Toledo and convince its inhabitants to submit.32\u201333\nCollins argues that unassimilated Berber garrisons in al-Andalus engaged in local vendettas and feuds, such as the conflict with the Banu Mahsa.33 This was due to the limited power of the Umayyad emir's central authority. Collins states that \"the Berbers, despite being fellow Muslims, were despised by those who claimed Arab descent\".33\u201334 As well as having feuds with Arab factions, the Berbers sometimes had major conflicts with the local communities where they were stationed. In 794, the Berber garrison of Tarragona massacred the inhabitants of the city. Tarragona was uninhabited for seven years until the Frankish conquest of Barcelona led to its reoccupation.34\nBerber groups were involved in the rebellion of Umar ibn Hafsun from 880 to 915.121\u2013122 Ibn Hafsun rebelled in 880, was captured, then escaped in 883 to his base in Bobastro. There he formed an alliance with the Banu Rifa' tribe of Berbers, who had a stronghold in Alhama.122 He then formed alliances with other local Berber clans, taking the towns of Osuna, Estepa, and Ecija in 889. He captured Jaen in 892.122 He was only defeated in 915 by Abd ar-Rahman III.125\nThroughout the ninth century, the Berber garrisons were one of the main military supports of the Umayyad regime.37 Although they had caused numerous problems for Abd ar-Rahman I, Collins suggests that by the reign of Al-Hakam the Berber conflicts with Arabs and native Iberians meant that Berbers could only look to the Umayyad regime for support and patronage and developed solid ties of loyalty to the emirs. However, they were also difficult to control, and by the end of the ninth century the Berber frontier garrisons disappear from the sources. Collins says this might be because they migrated back to north Africa or gradually assimilated.37\nIn al-Andalus during the Umayyad caliphate.\nNew waves of Berber settlers arrived in al-Andalus in the 10th century, brought as mercenaries by Abd ar-Rahman III, who proclaimed himself caliph in 929, to help him in his campaigns to restore Umayyad authority in areas that had overthrown it during the reigns of the previous emirs.103, 131, 168 These new Berbers \"lacked any familiarity with the pattern of relationships\" that had existed in al-Andalus in the 700s and 800s;103 thus they were not involved in the same web of traditional conflicts and loyalties as the previously already existing Berber garrisons.168\nNew frontier settlements were built for the new Berber mercenaries. Written sources state that some of the mercenaries were placed in Calatrava, which was refortified.168 Another Berber settlement called Vascos, west of Toledo, is not mentioned in the historical sources, but has been excavated archaeologically. It was a fortified town, had walls, and a separate fortress or alcazar. Two cemeteries have also been discovered. The town was established in the 900s as a frontier town for Berbers, probably of the Nafza tribe. It was abandoned soon after the Castilian occupation of Toledo in 1085. The Berber inhabitants took all their possessions with them.169\nIn the 900s, the Umayyad caliphate faced a challenge from the Fatimids in North Africa. The Fatimid Caliphate of the 10th century was established by the Kutama Berbers. After taking the city of Kairouan and overthrowing the Aghlabids in 909, the Mahdi Ubayd Allah was installed by the Kutama as Imam and Caliph, which posed a direct challenge to the Umayyad's own claim.169 The Fatimids gained overlordship over the Idrisids, then launched a conquest of the Maghreb. To counter the threat, the Umayyads crossed the strait to take Ceuta in 931,171 and actively formed alliances with Berber confederacies, such as the Zenata and the Awraba. Rather than fighting each other directly, the Fatimids and Umayyads competed for Berber allegiances. In turn, this provided a motivation for the further conversion of Berbers to Islam, many of the Berbers, particularly farther south, away from the Mediterranean, being still Christian and pagan.169\u2013170 In turn, this would contribute to the establishment of the Almoravid dynasty and Almohad Caliphate, which would have a major impact on al-Andalus and contribute to the end of the Umayyad caliphate.170\nWith the help of his new mercenary forces, Abd ar-Rahman launched a series of attacks on parts of the Iberian peninsula that had fallen away from Umayyad allegiance. In the 920s he campaigned against the areas that rebelled under Umar ibn Hafsun and refused to submit until the 920s. He conquered M\u00e9rida in 928\u2013929, Ceuta in 931, and Toledo in 932.171\u2013172 In 934 he began a campaign in the north against Ramiro II of Leon and Muhammad ibn Hashim al-Tujibi, the governor of Zaragoza. According to Ibn Hayyan, after inconclusively confronting al-Tujibi on the Ebro, Abd ar-Rahman briefly forced the Kingdom of Pamplona into submission, ravaged Castile and Alava, and met Ramiro II in an inconclusive battle.171\u2013172 From 935 to 937, he confronted the Tujibids, defeating them in 937. In 939, Ramiro II defeated the combined Umayyad and Tujibid armies in the Battle of Simancas.146\u2013147\nUmayyad influence in western North Africa spread through diplomacy rather than conquest.172 The Umayyads sought out alliances with various Berber confederacies. These would declare loyalty to the Umayyad caliphate in opposition to the Fatimids. The Umayyads would send gifts, including embroidered silk ceremonial cloaks. During this time, mints in cities on the Moroccan coast\u2014Fes, Sijilmasa, Sfax, and al-Nakur\u2014occasionally issued coins with the names of Umayyad caliphs, showing the extent of Umayyad diplomatic influence.172 The text of a letter of friendship from a Berber leader to the Umayyad caliph has been preserved in the work of 'Isa al-Razi.\nDuring Abd ar-Rahman's reign, tensions increased between the three distinct components of the Muslim community in al-Andalus: Berbers, Saqaliba (European slaves), and those of Arab or mixed Arab and Gothic descent.175 Following Abd ar-Rahman's proclamation of the new Umayyad caliphate in Cordoba, the Umayyads placed a great emphasis on the Umayyad membership of the Quraysh tribe.180 This led to a fashion, in Cordoba, for claiming pure Arab ancestry as opposed to descent from freed slaves.181 Claims of descent from Visigothic noble families also became common.181\u2013182 However, an \"immediately detrimental consequence of this acute consciousness of ancestry was the revival of ethnic disparagement, directed in particular against the Berbers and the Saqaliba\".182\nWhen the Fatimids moved their capital to Egypt in 969, they left north Africa in charge of viceroys from the Zirid clan of Sanhaja Berbers, who were Fatimid loyalists and enemies of the Zenata.170 The Zirids in turn divided their territories, assigning some to the Hammadid branch of the family to govern. The Hammadids became independent in 1014, with their capital at Qal'at Beni-Hammad. With the withdrawal of the Fatimids to Egypt, however, the rivalry with the Umayyads decreased.170\nAl-Hakam II sent Muhammad Ibn Ab\u012b '\u0100mir to north Africa in 973\u2013974 to act as (chief justice) to the Berber groups that had accepted Umayyad authority. Ibn Ab\u012b '\u0100mir was treasurer of the household of the caliph's wife and children, director of the mint at Madinat al-Zahra, commander of the Cordoba police, and qadi of the frontier. During his time as qadi in north Africa, Ibn Abi Amir developed close ties with the North African Berbers.186\nConsiderable resentment arose in Cordoba against the increasing numbers of Berbers brought from north Africa by al-Mansur and his children Abd al-Malik and Sanchuelo.198 It was said that Sanchuelo ordered anyone attending his court to wear Berber turbans, which Roger Collins suggests may not have been true, but shows that hostile anti-Berber propaganda was being used to discredit the sons of al-Mansur. In 1009, Sanchuelo had himself proclaimed Hisham II's successor, and then went on military campaign. However, while he was away a revolt took place. Sanchuelo's palace was sacked and his support fell away. As he marched back to Cordoba his own Berber mercenaries abandoned him.197\u2013198 Knowing the strength of ill feeling against them in Cordoba, they thought Sanchuelo would be unable to protect them, and so they went elsewhere in order to survive and secure their own interests.198 Sanchuelo was left with only a few followers, and was captured and killed in 1009. Hisham II abdicated and was succeeded by Muhammad II al-Mahdi.\nHaving abandoned Sanchuelo, the Berbers who had formed his army turned to support another ambitious Umayyad, Sulayman. They obtained logistical support from Count Sancho Garcia of Castile. Marching on Cordoba, they defeated Saqaliba general Wadih and forced Muhammad II al-Mahdi to flee to Toledo. They then installed Sulayman as caliph, and based themselves in the Madinat al-Zahra to avoid friction with the local population.198\u2013199 Wadih and al-Mahdi formed an alliance with the Counts of Barcelona and Urgell and marched back on Cordoba. They defeated Sulayman and the Berber forces in a battle near Cordoba in 1010. To avoid being destroyed, the Berbers fled towards Algeciras.199\nAl-Mahdi swore to exterminate the Berbers and pursued them. However, he was defeated in battle near Marbella. With Wadih, he fled back to Cordoba while his Catalan allies went home. The Berbers turned around and besieged Cordoba. Deciding that he was about to lose, Wadih overthrew al-Mahdi and sent his head to the Berbers, replacing him with Hisham II.199 However, the Berbers did not end the siege. They methodically destroyed Cordoba's suburbs, pinning the inhabitants inside the old Roman walls and destroying the Madinat al-Zahra. Wadih's allies killed him, and the Cordoba garrison surrendered with the expectation of amnesty. However, \"a massacre ensued in which the Berbers took revenge for many personal and collective injuries and permanently settled several feuds in the process\".200 The Berbers made Sulayman caliph once again. Ibn Idhari said that the installation of Sulayman in 1013 was the moment when \"the rule of the Berbers began in Cordoba and that of the Umayyads ended, after it had existed for two hundred and sixty eight years and forty-three days\".200\nIn al-Andalus in the Taifa period.\nDuring the Taifa era, the petty kings came from a variety of ethnic groups; some\u2014for instance the Zirid kings of Granada\u2014were of Berber origin. The Taifa period ended when a Berber dynasty\u2014the Moroccan Almoravids\u2014took over al-Andalus; they were succeeded by the Almohad dynasty of Morocco, during which time al-Andalus flourished.\nAfter the fall of Cordoba in 1013, the Saqaliba fled from the city to secure their own fiefdoms. One group of Saqaliba seized Orihuela from its Berber garrison and took control of the entire region.201\nAmong the Berbers who were brought to al-Andalus by al-Mansur were the Zirid family of Sanhaja Berbers. After the fall of Cordoba, the Zirids took over Granada in 1013, forming the Zirid kingdom of Granada. The Saqaliba Khayran, with his own Umayyad figurehead Abd ar-Rahman IV al-Murtada, attempted to seize Granada from the Zirids in 1018, but failed. Khayran then executed Abd ar-Rahman IV. Khayran's son, Zuhayr, also made war on the Zirid kingdom of Granada, but was killed in 1038.202\nIn Cordoba, conflicts continued between the Berber rulers and those of the citizenry who saw themselves as Arab.202 After being installed as caliph with Berber support, Sulayman was pressured into distributing southern provinces to his Berber allies. The Sanhaja departed from Cordoba at this time. The Zenata Berber Hammudids received the important districts of Ceuta and Algeciras. The Hammudids claimed a family relation to the Idrisids, and thus traced their ancestry to the caliph Ali. In 1016 they rebelled in Ceuta, claiming to be supporting the restoration of Hisham II. They took control of M\u00e1laga, then marched on Cordoba, taking it and executing Sulayman and his family. Ali ibn Hammud al-Nasir declared himself caliph, a position he held for two years.203\nFor some years, Hammudids and Umayyads fought one another and the caliphate passed between them several times. Hammudids also fought among themselves. The last Hammudid caliph reigned until 1027. The Hammudids were then expelled from Cordoba, where there was still a great deal of anti-Berber sentiment. The Hammudids remained in M\u00e1laga until expelled by the Zirids in 1056.203 The Zirids of Granada controlled M\u00e1laga until 1073, after which separate Zirid kings retained control over the taifas of Granada and Malaga until the Almoravid conquest.\nDuring the taifa period, the Aftasid dynasty, based in Badajoz, controlled a large territory centered on the Guadiana River valley. The area of Aftasid control was very large, stretching from the Sierra Morena and the taifas of M\u00e9rtola and Silves in the south, to the Campo de Calatrava in the west, the Montes de Toledo in the northwest, and nearly as far as Oporto in the northeast.\nAccording to Bernard Reilly,13 during the taifa period genealogy continued to be an obsession of the upper classes in al-Andalus. Most wanted to trace their lineage back to the Syrian and Yemeni Arabs who accompanied the invasion. In contrast, tracing descent from the Berbers who came with the same invasion \"was to be stigmatized as of inferior birth\".13 Reilly notes, however, that in practice the two groups had by the 11th century become almost indistinguishable: \"both groups gradually ceased to be distinguishable parts of the Muslim population, except when one of them actually ruled a taifa, in which case his low origins were well publicized by his rivals\".\nNevertheless, distinctions between Arab, Berber, and slave were not the stuff of serious politics, either within or between the taifas. It was the individual family that was the unit of political activity.\"13 The Berber that arrived towards the end of the caliphate as mercenary forces, says Reilly, amounted to only about 20 thousand people in a total al-Andalusi population of six million. Their high visibility was due to their foundation of taifa dynasties rather than large numbers.13\nIn the power hierarchy, Berbers were situated between the Arabic aristocracy and the Muladi populace. Ethnic rivalry was one of the most important factors driving Andalusi politics. Berbers made up as much as 20% of the population of the occupied territory.\nIn al-Andalus under the Almoravids.\nDuring the taifa period, the Almoravid empire developed in northwest Africa, whose core was formed by the Lamtuna branch of the Sanhaja Berber.99 In the mid-11th century, they allied with the Guddala and Massufa Berber. At that time, the Almoravid leader Yahya ibn Ibrahim went on a hajj. On his way back he met Malikite preachers in Kairouan, and invited them to his land. Malikite disciple Abd Allah ibn Yasin accepted the invitation. Traveling to Morocco, he established a military monastery or ribat where he trained a highly motivated and disciplined fighting force. In 1054 and 1055, employing these specially trained forces, Almoravid leader Yahya ibn Umar defeated the Kingdom of Ghana and the Zenata Berber. After Yahya ibn Umar died, his brother Abu Bakr ibn Umar pursued an Almoravid expansion. Forced to resolve a Sanhaja civil war, he left control of the Moroccan conquests to his brother, Yusuf ibn Tashfin. Yusuf continued to conquer territory; and following Abu Bakr's death in 1087, he became the Almoravid leader.100\u2013101\nAfter their loss of Cordoba, the Hammudids had occupied Algeciras and Ceuta. In the mid-11th century, the Hammudids lost control of their Iberian possessions, but retained a small taifa kingdom based in Ceuta. In 1083, Yusuf ibn Tashufin conquered Ceuta. In the same year, al-Mutamid, king of the Taifa of Seville, traveled to Morocco to appeal to Yusuf for help against King Alfonso VI of Castile. Earlier, in 1079, the king of Badajoz, al-Mutawakkil, had appealed to Yusuf for help against Alfonso. After the fall of Toledo to Alfonso VI in 1085, al-Mutamid appealed again to Yusuf. This time, financed by the taifa kings of Iberia, Yusuf crossed to al-Andalus and took direct personal control of Algeciras in 1086.102\u2013103\nModern history.\nThe Kabylians were independent of outside control during the period of Ottoman Empire rule in North Africa. They lived primarily in three states or confederations: the Kingdom of Ait Abbas, Kingdom of Kuku, and the principality of A\u00eft Jubar. The Kingdom of Ait Abbas was a Berber state of North Africa, controlling Lesser Kabylie and its surroundings from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century. It is referred to in the Spanish historiography as ; sometimes more commonly referred to by its ruling family, the Mokrani, in Berber ( ). Its capital was the Kal\u00e2a of Ait Abbas, an impregnable citadel in the Biban mountain range.\nThe most serious native revolt against colonial power in French Algeria since the time of Abd al-Qadir broke out in 1871 in the Kabylie and spread through much of Algeria. By April 1871, 250 tribes had risen, or nearly a third of Algeria's population. In the aftermath of this revolt and until 1892, the Kabyle myth, which supposed a variety of stereotypes based on a binary between Arabs and Kabyle people, reached its climax.\nIn 1902, the French penetrated the Hoggar Mountains and defeated Ahaggar Tuareg in the battle of Tit.\nIn 1912, Morocco was divided into French and Spanish zones. The Rif Berbers rebelled, led by Abd el-Krim, a former officer of the Spanish administration. In July 1921, the Spanish army in northeastern Morocco, under Manuel Silvestre, were routed by the forces of Abd el-Krim, in what became known in Spain as the Disaster of Annual. The Spaniards may have lost up to 22,000\u00a0soldiers at Annual and in subsequent fighting.\nDuring the Algerian War (1954\u20131962), the FLN and ALN's reorganisation of the country created, for the first time, a unified Kabyle administrative territory, wilaya III, being as it was at the centre of the anti-colonial struggle. From the moment of Algerian independence, tensions developed between Kabyle leaders and the central government.\nSoon after gaining independence in the middle of the twentieth century, the countries of North Africa established Arabic as their official language, replacing French, Spanish, and Italian; although the shift from European colonial languages to Arabic for official purposes continues even to this day. As a result, most Berbers had to study and know Arabic, and had no opportunities until the twenty-first century to use their mother tongue at school or university. This may have accelerated the existing process of Arabization of Berbers, especially in already bilingual areas, such as among the Chaouis of Algeria. Tamazight is now taught in Aur\u00e8s since the march led by Salim Yezza in 2004.\nWhile Berberism had its roots before the independence of these countries, it was limited to the Berber elite. It only began to succeed among the greater populace when North African states replaced their European colonial languages with Arabic and identified exclusively as Arabian nations, downplaying or ignoring the existence and the social specificity of Berbers. However, Berberism's distribution remains uneven. In response to its demands, Morocco and Algeria have both modified their policies, with Algeria redefining itself constitutionally as an \"Arab, Berber, Muslim nation\".\nThere is an identity-related debate about the persecution of Berbers by the Arab-dominated regimes of North Africa through both Pan-Arabism and Islamism, their issue of identity is due to the pan-Arabist ideology of former Egyptian president, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Some activists have claimed that \"[i]t is time\u2014long past overdue\u2014to confront the racist arabization of the Amazigh lands.\"\nThe Black Spring was a series of violent disturbances and political demonstrations by Kabyle activists in the Kabylie region of Algeria in 2001. In the 2011 Libyan civil war, Berbers in the Nafusa Mountains were quick to revolt against the Gaddafi regime. The mountains became a stronghold of the rebel movement, and were a focal point of the conflict, with much fighting occurring between rebels and loyalists for control of the region. The Tuareg Rebellion of 2012 was waged against the Malian government by rebels with the goal of attaining independence for the northern region of Mali, known as Azawad. Since late 2016, massive riots have spread across Moroccan Berber communities in the Rif region. Another escalation took place in May 2017.\nIn Morocco, after the constitutional reforms of 2011, Berber has become an official language, and is now taught as a compulsory language in all schools regardless of the area or the ethnicity. In 2016, Algeria followed suit and changed the status of Berber from \"national\" to \"official\" language.\nAlthough Berberists who openly show their political orientations rarely reach high positions, Berbers have reached high positions in the social and political hierarchies across the Maghreb. Examples are the former president of Algeria, Liamine Zeroual; the former prime minister of Morocco, Driss Jettou; and Khalida Toumi, a feminist and Berberist militant, who has been nominated as head of the Ministry of Communication in Algeria.\nArabization.\nThe Arabization of the indigenous Berber populations was a result of the centuries-long Arab migrations to the Maghreb which began since the 7th century, in addition to changing the population's demographics. The early wave of migration prior to the 11th century contributed to the Berber adoption of Arab culture. Furthermore, the Arabic language spread during this period and drove Latin into extinction in the cities. The Arabization took place around Arab centres through the influence of Arabs in the cities and rural areas surrounding them.\nThe migration of Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym in the 11th century had a much greater influence on the process of Arabization of the population. It played a major role in spreading Bedouin Arabic to rural areas such as the countryside and steppes, and as far as the southern areas near the Sahara. It also heavily transformed the culture in the Maghreb into Arab culture, and spread nomadism in areas where agriculture was previously dominant. These Bedouin tribes accelerated and deepened the Arabization process, since the Berber population was gradually assimilated by the newcomers and had to share with them pastures and seasonal migration paths. By around the 15th century, the region of modern-day Tunisia had already been almost completely Arabized. As Arab nomads spread, the territories of the local Berber tribes were moved and shrank. The Zenata were pushed to the west and the Kabyles were pushed to the north. The Berbers took refuge in the mountains whereas the plains were Arabized.\nCurrently, most Arabized Berbers identify as Berber, although the prominence of Arab influences has fully assimilated them into the Arab cultural sphere.\nContemporary demographics.\nEthnic groups.\nEthnically, Berbers comprise a minority population in the Maghreb. Berbers comprise 15% to 25% the population of Algeria, 10% of Libya, 31% to 35% of Morocco, and 1% of Tunisia. Berber language speakers in the Maghreb comprise 30% to 40% of the Moroccan population, and 15% to 35% of the Algerian population, with smaller communities in Libya and very small groups in Tunisia, Egypt and Mauritania. Berber languages in total are spoken by around 14 million to 16 million people in Africa.\nProminent Berber ethnic groups include the Kabyles\u2014from Kabylia, a historical autonomous region of northern Algeria\u2014who number about six million and have kept, to a large degree, their original language and society; and the Shilha or Chleuh\u2014in High and Anti-Atlas and Sous Valley of Morocco\u2014who number about eight million. Other groups include the Riffians of northern Morocco, the Chaoui people of eastern Algeria, the Chenouas in western Algeria and the Nafusis of the Nafusa Mountains.\nOutside the Maghreb, the Tuareg in Mali (early settlement near the old imperial capital of Timbuktu), Niger, and Burkina Faso number some 850,000, 1,620,000, and 50,000, respectively. Tuaregs are a Berber ethnic group with a traditionally nomadic pastoralist lifestyle and are the principal inhabitants of the vast Sahara Desert.\nGenetics.\nGenetically, the Berbers form the principal indigenous ancestry in the region. Haplogroup E1b1b is the most frequent among Maghrebi groups, especially the downstream lineage of E1b1b1b1a, which is typical of the indigenous Berbers of North-West Africa. On the other hand, Haplogroup J1 is the second most frequent among Maghrebi groups and is more indicative of Middle East origins, and has its highest distribution among populations in the southern Arabian Peninsula. E1b1b1b accounts for 45% of North Africans, while Haplogroup J1-M267 accounts for 30% of North Africans, and has spread from Arabia.\nThe Semitic-speaking presence in the Maghreb is mainly due to the migratory movements of Phoenicians in the 3rd century BC and large scale migrations of Arab Bedouin tribes in the 11th century AD such as Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym, as well as other waves that occurred during the Arab migrations to the Maghreb (c.\u20097th century \u2013 17th century). The results of a study from 2017 suggest that these Arab migrations to the Maghreb were mainly a demographic process that heavily implied gene flow and remodeled the genetic structure of the Maghreb.\nDNA studies of Iberomaurusian peoples at Taforalt, Morocco dating to around 15,000 years ago have found them to have a distinctive Maghrebi ancestry formed from a mixture of Near Eastern and African ancestry, which is still found as a part of the genome of modern Northwest Africans. A 2025 study sequenced individuals from Takarkori (7,000 YBP) and discovered that most of their ancestry was from an unknown Ancestral North African lineage, related to the African admixture component found in Iberomaurusians. According to the study, the Takarkori people were distinct from both contemporary sub-Saharan Africans and non-Africans/Eurasians. They had \"only a minor component of non-African ancestry\" but did \"not carry sub-Saharan African ancestry, suggesting that, contrary to previous interpretations, the Green Sahara was not a corridor connecting Northern and sub-Saharan Africa.\"\nLater during the Neolithic, from around 7,500 years ago onwards, there was a migration into Northwest Africa of European Neolithic Farmers from the Iberian Peninsula (who had originated in Anatolia several thousand years prior), as well as pastoralists from the Levant, both of whom also significantly contributed to the ancestry of modern Northwest Africans. The proto-Berber tribes evolved from these prehistoric communities during the late Bronze- and early Iron ages.\nDiaspora.\nAccording to a 2004 estimate, there were about 2.2 million Berber immigrants in Europe, especially the Riffians in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France; and Algerians of Kabyles and Chaouis heritage in France.\nPolitics.\nBerberism.\nSince the 1970s,209 a political movement, initially led by the Kabyles of Algeria, has developed among various parts of the Berber populations of North Africa to promote a collective Amazigh ethnic identity. It is variously referred to as Amazighism, Berberism, the Berber identity movement, or the Berber Culture Movement. The movement does not have a specific organization and cuts across both modern national boundaries and traditional tribal divisions. It is generally consistent in its demands, which include greater linguistic rights for Berber languages and greater official and social recognition of Amazigh culture. These Berberists also aimed to counter the image that Berbers were a mere collection of disparate tribes speaking mutually incomprehensible languages. They did this by introducing \"Imazighen\" as a collective term of self-referral and claimed that the various Berber languages once constituted a single language.\nThe political outcomes have been different in each country of the Maghreb and are shaped by other factors such as geography and socioeconomic circumstances. In Algeria, the politics of the movement were focused in Kabylie, were more overtly political, and have sometimes been confrontational. In Morocco, where Amazigh populations are spread across a wider area, the movement has been less overtly political and confrontational.213 In the 1990s, both states made concessions to this movement or attempted to ally itself with it, partly in response to the challenge of other political forces such as Islamism.214\nPolitical tensions.\nOver the past few decades, political tensions have arisen between some Berber groups (especially the Kabyles and Rifians) and North African governments, partly over linguistic and social issues. For example, in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, giving children Berber names was banned. In Morocco, the Arabic language and Arab culture occupied a superior position in official and social domains. The Arabist ideology was popular among Moroccan society, as well as within bureaucratic cadres and the political parties. The regime of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya also banned the teaching of Berber languages, and, in a 2008 leaked diplomatic cable, the Libyan leader warned Berber minorities: \"You can call yourselves whatever you want inside your homes \u2013 Berbers, Children of Satan, whatever \u2013 but you are only Libyans when you leave your homes.\" He denied the existence of Berbers as a separate ethnicity, and called them a \"product of colonialism\" created by the West to divide Libya. As a result of the persecution suffered under Gaddafi's rule, many Berbers joined the Libyan opposition in the 2011 Libyan civil war.\nIn contrast, many Berber students in Morocco supported Nasserism and Arabism, rather than Berberism. Many educated Berbers were attracted to the leftist National Union of Popular Forces rather than the Berber-based Popular Movement.\nLanguages.\nThe Berber languages form a branch of the Afroasiatic language family, a large family that also includes Semitic languages like Arabic and the Ancient Egyptian language. Most Berbers speak Arabic and French.\n is a generic name for all of the Berber languages, which consist of many closely related varieties and dialects. Among these Berber languages are Riffian, Zuwara, Kabyle, Shilha, Siwi, Zenaga, Sanhaja, Tazayit (Central Atlas Tamazight), Tum\u1e93abt (Mozabite), Nafusi, and Tamasheq, as well as the ancient Guanche language.\nMost Berber languages have a high percentage of borrowing and influence from the Arabic language, as well as from other languages. For example, Arabic loanwords represent 35% to 46% of the total vocabulary of the Kabyle language and represent 51.7% of the total vocabulary of Tarifit. The least influenced are the Tuareg languages. Almost all Berber languages took from Arabic the pharyngeal fricatives /\u0295/ and /\u0127/, the (nongeminated) uvular stop /q/, and the voiceless pharyngealized consonant /\u1e63/. In turn, Berber languages have influenced local dialects of Arabic. Although Maghrebi Arabic has a predominantly Semitic and Arabic vocabulary, it contains a few Berber loanwords which represent 2\u20133% of the vocabulary of Libyan Arabic, 8\u20139% of Algerian Arabic and Tunisian Arabic, and 10\u201315% of Moroccan Arabic.\nBerber languages in total are spoken by around 14 million to 16 million people in Africa (see population estimation). These Berber speakers are mainly concentrated in Morocco and Algeria, followed by Mali, Niger, and Libya. Smaller Berber-speaking communities are also found as far east as Egypt, with a southwestern limit today at Burkina Faso.\nReligion.\nThe Berber identity encompasses language, religion, and ethnicity, and is rooted in the entire history and geography of North Africa. Berbers are not an entirely homogeneous ethnicity, and they include a range of societies, ancestries, and lifestyles. The unifying forces for the Berber people may be their shared language or a collective identification with Berber heritage and history.\nAs a legacy of the spread of Islam, the Berbers are now mostly Sunni Muslim. However, the Mozabite Berbers of the M'zab Valley in the town of Gharda\u00efa in Algeria and some Libyan Berbers in the Nafusa Mountains and Zuwara are primarily adherents of Ibadi Islam.\nIn antiquity, before the arrival of Abrahamic faiths into North Africa, the Berber people adhered to the traditional Berber religion. This traditional religion emphasized ancestor veneration, polytheism, and animism. Many ancient Berber beliefs were developed locally. Whereas others were influenced over time through contact with other traditional African religions (such as the Ancient Egyptian religion), or borrowed during antiquity from the Punic religion, Judaism, Iberian mythology, and the Hellenistic religion. The most recent influence came from Islam and pre-Islamic Arab religion during the medieval period. Some of the ancient Berber beliefs still subtly exist today within the Berber popular culture and tradition.\nUntil the 1960s, there was also a significant Jewish Berber minority in Morocco, but emigration (mostly to Israel and France) dramatically reduced their number to only a few hundred individuals.\nFollowing Christian missions, the Kabyle community in Algeria has a recently constituted Christian minority, both Protestant and Roman Catholic; and a 2015 study estimates that 380,000 Muslim Algerians have converted to Christianity in Algeria. There are Berbers among the 8,000\u201340,000 Moroccans who have converted to Christianity in the last decades, some of whom explain their conversion as an attempt to go back to their \"Christian sources\". The \"International Religious Freedom Report\" for 2007 estimates that thousands of Tunisian Berber Muslims have converted to Christianity.\nArchitecture.\nAntiquity.\nSome of the earliest evidence of original Amazigh culture in North Africa has been found in the highlands of the Sahara and dates from the second millennium BC, when the region was much less arid than it is today and when the Amazigh population was most likely in the process of spreading across North Africa. Numerous archaeological sites associated with the Garamantes have been found in the Fezzan (in present-day Libya), attesting to the existence of small villages, towns, and tombs. At least one settlement dates from as early as 1000 BC. The structures were initially built in dry stone, but around the middle of the millennium (c.\u2009500 BC) they began to be built with mudbrick instead.23 By the second century AD there is evidence of large villas and more sophisticated tombs associated with the aristocracy of this society, in particular at Germa.24\nFurther west, the kingdom of Numidia was contemporary with the Phoenician civilization of Carthage and the Roman Republic. Among other things, the Numidians have left thousands of pre-Christian tombs. The oldest of these is Medracen in present-day Algeria, believed to date from the time of Masinissa (202\u2013148 BC). Possibly influenced by Greek architecture further east, or built with the help of Greek craftsmen, the tomb consists of a large tumulus constructed in well-cut ashlar masonry and featuring sixty Doric columns and an Egyptian-style cornice. Another famous example is the Tomb of the Christian Woman in western Algeria. This structure consists of columns, a dome, and spiral pathways that lead to a single chamber. A number of \"tower tombs\" from the Numidian period can also be found in sites from Algeria to Libya. Despite their wide geographic range, they often share a similar style: a three-story structure topped by a convex pyramid. They may have initially been inspired by Greek monuments but they constitute an original type of structure associated with Numidian culture. Examples of these are found at Siga, Soumaa d'el Khroub, Dougga, and Sabratha.\nMediterranean empires of Carthage and Rome left their mark in the material culture of North Africa as well. Phoenician and Punic (Carthaginian) remains can be found at Carthage itself and at Lixus. Numerous remains of Roman architecture can be found across the region, such as the amphitheatre of El Jem and the archaeological sites of Sabratha, Timgad, and Volubilis, among others.\nAfter the Muslim conquest.\nAfter the Arab-Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the 7th and early 8th centuries, Islamic architecture developed in the region. Various dynasties, either based in North Africa or beyond it, contributed to the architecture of the region, including the Aghlabids, the Fatimids, and the Umayyads of Cordoba. In addition to the general \"Moorish\" style prevalent in North Africa during the Islamic period, some architectural styles and structures in North Africa are distinctively associated with areas that have maintained strong Berber populations and cultures, including but not limited to the Atlas Mountain regions of Morocco, the Aur\u00e8s and M'zab regions of Algeria, and southern Tunisia. They do not form one single architectural style but rather a diverse variety of local vernacular styles. Berber ruling dynasties also contributed to the formation and patronage of western Islamic art and architecture through their political domination of the region between the 11th and 16th centuries (during the rule of the Almoravids, Almohads, Marinids and Hafsids, among others).\nIn Morocco, the largely Berber-inhabited rural valleys and oases of the Atlas and the south are marked by numerous kasbahs (fortresses) and \"ksour\" (fortified villages), typically flat-roofed structures made of rammed earth and decorated with local geometric motifs, as with the famous example of Ait Benhaddou. Likewise, southern Tunisia is dotted with hilltop \"ksour\" and multi-story fortified granaries (\"ghorfa\"), such as the examples in Medenine and Ksar Ouled Soltane, which are typically built with loose stone bound by a mortar of clay. Fortified granaries also exist in the Aures region of Algeria, or in the form of \"agadir\"s of which numerous examples can be found in Morocco. The island of Jerba in Tunisia, traditionally dominated by Ibadi Berbers, has a traditional style of mosque architecture that consists of low-lying structures built in stone and covered in whitewash. Their prayer halls are domed and they have short, often round minarets. The mosques are often described as \"fortified mosques\" because the island's flat topography made it vulnerable to attacks and as a result the mosques were designed in part to act as watch posts along the coast or in the countryside. The M'zab region of Algeria (e.g. Gharda\u00efa) also has distinctive mosques and houses that are completely whitewashed, but built in rammed earth. The structures here also make frequent use of domes and barrel vaults. Unlike in Jerba, the distinctive minarets in this region are tall and have a square base, tapering towards the end and crowned with \"horn\"-like corners.\nCulture and arts.\nSocial context.\nThe traditional social structure of the Berbers has been tribal. A leader is appointed to command the tribe. In the Middle Ages, many women had the power to govern, such as Dihya and Tazoughert Fatma in the Aur\u00e8s Mountains, Tin Hinan in the Hoggar, and Chemci in A\u00eft Iraten. Lalla Fatma N'Soumer was a Berber woman in Kabylie who fought against the French.\nThe majority of Berber tribes currently have men as heads of the tribe. In Algeria, the el Kseur platform in Kabylie gives tribes the right to fine criminal offenders. In areas of Chaoui, tribal leaders enact sanctions against criminals. The Tuareg have a king who decides the fate of the tribe and is known as Amenokal; it is a very hierarchical society. The Mozabites are governed by the spiritual leaders of Ibadism and lead communal lives. During the crisis of Berriane between the Maliki and Ibadite movements, the heads of each tribe began talks to end the crisis and resolved the problem.\nIn marriages, the man usually selects the woman, and depending on the tribe, the family often makes the decision. In contrast, in the Tuareg culture, the woman chooses her future husband. The rites of marriage are different for each tribe. Families are either patriarchal or matriarchal, according to the tribe.\nTraditionally, men take care of livestock. They migrate by following the natural cycle of grazing, and seeking water and shelter. They are thus assured of an abundance of wool, cotton, and plants used for dyeing. For their part, women look after the family and handicrafts \u2013 first for their personal use, and secondly for sale in the souqs in their locality.\nVisual arts.\nThe Berber tribes traditionally weave kilims (tapestry-woven carpets), whose designs maintain the traditional appearance and distinctiveness of the region of origin of each tribe, which has in effect its own repertoire of drawings. The plain weave textile designs include a wide variety of stripes and, more rarely, geometrical patterns such as triangles and diamonds. Additional decorations such as sequins or fringes, are typical of Berber weave in Morocco. The nomadic and semi-nomadic lifestyle of the Berbers is suitable for weaving kilims. In Algeria, the cloak-like kachabia is typical Berber masculine clothing.\nTraditional Berber jewelry is a style of jewellery, originally worn by women and girls of different rural Berber groups of Morocco, Algeria and other North African countries. It is usually made of silver and includes elaborate triangular plates and pins, originally used as clasps for garments, necklaces, bracelets, earrings and similar items. In modern times, these types of jewellery are produced also in contemporary variations and sold as a commercial product of ethnic-style fashion.\nFrom December 2004 to August 2006, the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology at Harvard University presented the exhibition \"Imazighen! Beauty and Artisanship in Berber Life\", curated by Susan Gilson Miller and Lisa Bernasek, with an accompanying catalogue on artifacts from the Berber regions Kabylia in northeastern Algeria, the Rif mountains of northeastern Morocco and the Tuareg regions of the Algerian Sahara.\nFrom June to September 2007, the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly in Paris showed an exhibition on the history of traditional ceramics in Algeria, titled \"Ideqqi, art de femmes berb\u00e8res\" (Art of Berber women), and published an accompanying catalogue. The exhibition highlighted the originality of these pieces compared to urban earthenware, underlining their African roots as well as close relationship with the ancient art of the Mediterranean.\nCuisine.\nBerber cuisine is a traditional cuisine that has evolved little over time. It differs from one area to another between and within Berber groups.\nPrincipal Berber foods are:\nAlthough they are the original inhabitants of North Africa, and in spite of numerous incursions by Phoenicians, Romans, Byzantines, Ottomans, and French, Berber groups lived in very contained communities. Having been subject to limited external influences, these populations lived free from acculturating factors.\nMusic.\n Berber music has a wide variety of regional styles. The best known are Moroccan music, the popular Gasba, Kabyle and Chawi music of Algeria, and the widespread Tuareg music of Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali. Instruments used include the bendir (large drums) and the guembri (a lute). There are three varieties of Berber folk music: village music, ritual music, and the music performed by professional musicians. Village music is performed collectively for dancing, including ahidus and ahouach dances, which each begin with a chanted prayer. Ritual music is performed at regular ceremonies to celebrate marriages and other important life events, and is also used as protection against evil spirits. Professional musicians () travel in groups of four, led by a poet (). The amydaz recites improvised poems, often accompanied by drums and a rabab (a one-stringed fiddle), along with a who plays a double clarinet and acts as a clown for the group. The Chleuh Berbers have professional musicians called s who play in ensembles consisting of lutes, rababs, and cymbals, with any number of vocalists. The leader, or , leads the group in its music and choreography. These performances begin with an instrumental on rabab, which also gives the notes of the melody which follows. The next phase is the , or sung poetry, and then , a danced overture, , an energetic song, , a dance, and finally the rhythmically swift . There is some variation in the order of the presentation, but the is always at the beginning, and the always at the end.\nTraditional Berber festivals include Fantasia, Imilchil marriage festival and Udayn n Acur.\nRole in tourism.\nIn recent decades, Berber communities and culture have become involved in the tourism industries of some North African countries, such as Morocco and Tunisia. Images and descriptions of Berber culture play a central role in the tourism industry of Morocco, where they are prominently featured in the marketing of products and locations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

By convention, the specially built places of worship for some religions are commonly called \"temples\" in English, while those of other religions are not, even though they fulfill very similar functions. \nThe religions for which the terms are used include the great majority of ancient religions that are now extinct, such as the Ancient Egyptian religion and the Ancient Greek religion. Among religions still active: Hinduism (whose temples are called mandir or kovil), Buddhism (whose temples are called vihara), Sikhism (whose temples are called gurudwara), Jainism (whose temples are sometimes called derasar), Zoroastrianism (whose temples are sometimes called agiary), the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith (which are often simply referred to as Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship), Taoism (which are sometimes called daoguan), Shinto (which are often called jinja), Confucianism (which are sometimes called the Temple of Confucius).\nReligions whose places of worship are generally not called \"temples\" in English include Christianity, which has churches, Islam with mosques, and Judaism with synagogues (although some of these use \"temple\" as a name).\nThe form and function of temples are thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to be, in some sense, the \"house\" of one or more deities. Typically, offerings of some form are made to the deity, and other rituals are enacted, and a special group of clergy maintain and operate the temple. The degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly; often parts, or even the whole main building, can only be accessed by the clergy. Temples typically have a main building and a larger precinct, which may contain many other buildings or may be a dome-shaped structure, much like an igloo.\nThe word comes from Ancient Rome, where a constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest, or augur. It has the same root as the word \"template\", a plan in preparation for the building that was marked out on the ground by the augur.\nIndian temples.\nHindu temple.\nHindu temples are known by many different names, varying on region and language, including Alayam, \"Mandir\", \"Mandira\", \"Ambalam\", \"Gudi\", \"Kavu\", \"Koil\", \"Kovil\", \"D\u00e9ul\", \"Raul\", \"Devasthana\", \"Devalaya\", \"Devayatan\", \"Devakula\", \"Devagiriha\", \"Degul\", \"Deva Mandiraya\", and \"Devalayam\". Hindu temple architecture is mainly divided into the Dravidian style of the south and the Nagara style of the north, with other regional styles.\nThe basic elements of the Hindu temple remain the same across all periods and styles. The most essential feature is the inner sanctuary, the \"garbhagriha\" or womb-chamber, where the primary \"murti\" or cult image of a deity is housed in a simple bare cell. Around this chamber there are often other structures and buildings, in the largest cases covering several acres. On the exterior, the garbhagriha is crowned by a tower-like \"shikhara\", also called the \"vimana\" in the south. The shrine building may include an ambulatory for \"parikrama\" (circumambulation), one or more mandapas or congregation halls, and sometimes an antarala antechamber and porch between garbhagriha and mandapa.\nA Hindu temple is a symbolic house, the seat and dwelling of Hindu gods. It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together according to Hindu faith. Inside its \"garbhagriha\" innermost sanctum, a Hindu temple contains a \"murti\" or Hindu god's image. Hindu temples are large and magnificent with a rich history. There is evidence of the use of sacred ground as far back as the Bronze Age and later during the Indus Valley civilization.\nOutside of the Indian subcontinent (India, Bangladesh and Nepal), Hindu temples have been built in various countries around the world. Either following the historic diffusion of Hinduism across Asia (e.g. ancient stone temples of Cambodia and Indonesia), or following the migration of the Indian Hindus' diaspora, to Western Europe (esp. Great Britain), North America (the United States and Canada), as well as Australia, Malaysia and Singapore, Mauritius and South Africa.\nBuddhist temples.\nBuddhist temples include the structures called stupa, wat and pagoda in different regions and languages. A Buddhist temple might contain a meditation hall hosting \"Buddharupa\", or the image of Buddha, as the object of concentration and veneration during a meditation. The stupa domed structures are also used in a circumambulation ritual called \"Pradakshina\".\nTemples in Buddhism represent the pure land or pure environment of a Buddha. Traditional Buddhist temples are designed to inspire inner and outer peace.\nThree types of structures are associated with the religious architecture of early Buddhism: monasteries (viharas), places to venerate relics (stupas), and shrines or prayer halls (chaityas, also called \"chaitya grihas\"), which later came to be called temples in some places. The pagoda is an evolution of the Indian stupas.\nThe initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of Gautama Buddha. The earliest archaeologically known example of a stupa is the relic stupa located in Vaishali, Bihar in India.\nIn accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into chaitya-grihas (prayer halls). These are exemplified by the complexes of the Ajanta Caves and the Ellora Caves (Maharashtra). The Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya in Bihar is another well-known example.\nAs Buddhism spread, Buddhist architecture diverged in style, reflecting the similar trends in Buddhist art. Building form was also influenced to some extent by the different forms of Buddhism in the northern countries, practising Mahayana Buddhism in the main and in the south where Theravada Buddhism prevailed.\nJain temples.\nA Jain temple, called a Derasar, is the place of worship for Jains, the followers of Jainism. Some famous Jain temples are Shikharji, Palitana temples, Ranakpur Jain temple, Shravan Belgola, Dilwara Temples and Lal Mandir. Jain temples are built with various architectural designs. Jain temples in North India are completely different from the Jain temples in South India, which in turn are quite different from Jain temples in West India. Additionally, a \"manastambha\" (literally 'column of honor') is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples.\nSikh temples.\nA Sikh temple is called a gurdwara, literally the \"doorway to the Guru\". Its most essential element is the presence of the Guru, Guru Granth Sahib. The gurdwara has an entrance from all sides, signifying that they are open to all without any distinction whatsoever. The gurdwara has a Darbar Sahib where the Guru Granth Sahib is seen and a Langar where people can eat free food. A gurdwara may also have a library, nursery, and classroom.\nMesopotamian temples.\nThe temple-building tradition of Mesopotamia derived from the cults of gods and deities in the Mesopotamian religion. It spanned several civilizations; from Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian, and Babylonian. The most common temple architecture of Mesopotamia is the structure of sun-baked bricks called a ziggurat, having the form of a terraced step pyramid with a flat upper terrace where the shrine or temple stood.\nEgyptian temples.\nAncient Egyptian temples were meant as places for the deities to reside on earth. Indeed, the term the Egyptians most commonly used to describe the temple building, , means 'mansion (or enclosure) of a god'.\nA god's presence in the temple linked the human and divine realms and allowed humans to interact with the god through ritual. These rituals, it was believed, sustained the god and allowed it to continue to play its proper role in nature. They were, therefore, a key part of the maintenance of \"maat\", the ideal order of nature and of human society in Egyptian belief. Maintaining was the entire purpose of Egyptian religion, and thus it was the purpose of a temple as well.\nAncient Egyptian temples were also of economic significance to Egyptian society. The temples stored and redistributed grain and came to own large portions of the nation's arable land (some estimate as much as 33% by the New Kingdom period). In addition, many of these Egyptian temples utilized the Tripartite Floor Plan in order to draw visitors to the center room.\nIn The Temple in Man, a work by R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, the author explores the idea that Egyptian temples, particularly the Temple of Luxor, are metaphysical representations of the human body. Schwaller de Lubicz suggests that these temples reflect the cosmic and spiritual order through their proportions and design. The author argues that the ancient Egyptians embedded knowledge of sacred geometry and spiritual awakening into their architecture, and that the human body itself is a temple that mirrors the harmony of the universe. The work connects the metaphysical symbolism of the temples to esoteric concepts, showing how the architecture reflects human anatomy and cosmic laws.\nGreco-Roman temples.\nGreek and Roman temples were originally built out of wood and mud bricks, but as the empires expanded, the temples grew to monumental size, made out of materials such as stone and marble on raised platforms. While the color has long since faded, The columns would have been painted in white, blue, red, and black. Above the columns would have been a sculpted or painted depiction of a myth or battle, with freestanding sculptures in the pediment triangles. The roofs were tiled and had sculptures of mythical animals or deities on the tops or corners. Greek temples also had several standard floor plans with very distinct column placement.\nLocated in the front of the temple were altars intended for sacrifices or offerings. Ouranic altars were usually square, lined with a metal pan for burnt offerings, and a flat top which was necessary for the ouranic gods to receive offerings. Chthonic altars, called bothros, were pits dug into the earth for liquid libations of animal sacrifices, milk, honey, and wine. The building which housed the cult statue or \"agalma\" in its \"cella\" was located in the center of the temple in Greek architecture, while in Rome, the cella was in the back. Greek temple architecture had a profound influence on ancient architectural traditions.\nGreco-Roman temples were built facing eastward, utilizing the rising sun in morning rituals. The location each temple was built also depended on many factors such as environment, myth, function, and divine experience. Most were built on sites associated with myths or a place a god had been believed to have performed a feat, or founded a town or city. Many Roman temples had close associations with important events in Roman history, such as military victories. Temples in cities were often dedicated to the founding deity of the city, but also served as civic and social centers. The Temple of Saturn even held the state treasury and treasury offices in its basement.\nEuropean polytheistic temples.\nThe Romans usually referred to a holy place of a pagan religion as ; in some cases this referred to a sacred grove, in others to a temple. Medieval Latin writers also sometimes used the word \"\", previously reserved for temples of the ancient Roman religion. In some cases it is hard to determine whether a temple was a building or an outdoor shrine. For temple buildings of the Germanic peoples, the Old Norse term \"hof\" is often used.\nZoroastrian temples.\nA Zoroastrian temple may also be called a \"Dar-e-mehr\" and an \"Atashkadeh\". A fire temple in Zoroastrianism is the place of worship for Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians revere fire in any form, and their temples contains an eternal flame, with \"Atash Behram\" (Fire of Victory) as the highest grade of all, as it combines 16 different types of fire gathered in elaborate rituals.\nIn the Zoroastrian religion, fire (\"Atar\"), together with clean water (\"Aban\"), are agents of ritual purity. Clean, white \"ash for the purification ceremonies is regarded as the basis of ritual life,\" which, \"are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple fire is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity\".\nChinese temples.\nChinese temples refer to temples in accordance with Chinese culture, which serve as a house of worship for Chinese faiths, namely Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and Chinese folk religion. Chinese temples were born from the age-old religion and tradition of Chinese people since the ancient era of imperial China, thus they are usually built in typical classical Chinese architecture.\nOther than the base constructed from an elevated platform of earth and stones, most parts of Chinese temples are made of timber carpentry, with parts of brick masonry and glazed ceramics for roofs and tile decorations. Typical Chinese temples have curved overhanging eaves and complicated carpentry of stacked roof construction. Chinese temples are known for their vivid colour and rich decorations. Their roofs are often decorated with mythical beasts, such as Chinese dragons and qilins, and sometimes also Chinese deities. Chinese temples can be found throughout Mainland China and Taiwan, and also where Chinese expatriate communities have settled abroad; thus Chinese temples can be found in Chinatowns worldwide.\nIndonesian temples.\n\"Candi\" is an Indonesian term to refer to ancient temples. Before the rise of Islam, between the 5th to 15th centuries, Dharmic faiths (Hinduism and Buddhism) were the majority in the Indonesian archipelago, especially in Java and Sumatra. As a result, numerous Hindu temples, locally known as , were constructed and dominated the landscape of Java. The architecture follows the typical Indonesian architectural traditions based on Vastu Shastra. The temple layout, especially in the Central Java period, incorporated mandala temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples. The ' was designed to mimic Meru, the holy mountain and the abode of the gods. In contemporary Indonesian Buddhist perspective, ' refers to a shrine, either ancient or new. Several contemporary \"viharas\" in Indonesia, for example, contain an actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples, such as the replica of Pawon and Plaosan's (small) temples.\nAccording to local beliefs, the Java valley had thousands of Hindu temples that co-existed with Buddhist temples, most of which were buried in the massive eruption of Mount Merapi in 1006 CE.\nMesoamerican temples.\nTemples of the Mesoamerican civilization usually took the shape of stepped pyramids with temples or shrines on top of the massive structure. They are more akin to the ziggurats of Mesopotamia than to Egyptian ones. A single or several flight(s) of steep steps from the base lead to the temple that stood on the plateau on top of the pyramid. The stone temple might be a square or a rounded structure with a door opening leading to a cella or inner sanctum. The plateau on top of the pyramid in front of the temple is where the ritualistic sacrifice took place.\nSome classic Mesoamerican pyramids are adorned with stories about the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl or Mesoamerican creation myths, written in the form of hieroglyphs on the rises of the steps of the pyramids, on the walls, and on the sculptures contained within. Notable example include Aztec Acatitlan and Mayan Chichen Itza, Uxmal and Tikal.\nJewish synagogues and temples.\nIn Judaism, the ancient Hebrew texts refer to a \"sanctuary\", \"palace\" or \"hall\" for each of the two ancient temples in Jerusalem, called in the Tanakh , which translates literally as 'YHWH's House'. In English \"temple\" is the normal term for them. \nThe Temple Mount in Jerusalem is the site where the First Temple of Solomon and the Second Temple were built. At the center of the structure was the Holy of Holies where only the High Priest could enter. The Temple Mount is now the site of the Islamic edifice, the Dome of the Rock (c.\u2009690 CE).\nThe Greek word \"synagogue\" came into use to describe Jewish (and Samaritan) places of worship during Hellenistic times and it, along with the Yiddish term \"shul\", and the original Hebrew term \"Beit Knesset\" ('House of meeting') are the terms in most universal usage. \nSince the 18th century, Jews in Western and Central Europe began to apply the name \"temple\", borrowed from the French where it was used to denote all non-Catholic prayer houses, to synagogues. The term became strongly associated with Reform institutions, in some of which both congregants and outsiders associated it with the elimination of the prayers for the restoration of the Jerusalem Temple, though this was not the original meaning\u2014traditional synagogues named themselves \"temple\" over a century before the advent of Reform, and many continued to do so after. In American parlance, \"temple\" is often synonymous with \"synagogue\", but especially non-Orthodox ones.\nThe term \"kenesa\", from the Aramaic for 'assembly', is used to describe the places of worship of Karaite Jews.\nExample of such temple is the Sofia Synagogue, Bulgaria the largest synagogue in Southeastern Europe and third-largest in Europe.\nChristian temples.\nOrthodox Christianity.\nThe word \"temple\" is used frequently in the tradition of Eastern Christianity; particularly the Eastern Orthodox Church, where the principal words used for houses of worship are \"temple\" and \"church\". The use of the word \"temple\" comes from the need to distinguish a building of the church vs. the church seen as the Body of Christ. In the Russian language (similar to other Slavic languages), while the general-purpose word for 'church' is \"tserkov\", the term (), 'temple', is used to refer to the church building as a temple of God (). The words \"church\" and \"temple\", in this case are interchangeable; however, the term \"church\" () is far more common. The term \"temple\" () is also commonly applied to larger churches. Some famous churches which are referred to as temples include the Hagia Sophia, Saint Basil's Cathedral, Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia, the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and the Temple of Saint Sava in Belgrade, Serbia.\nCatholicism.\nThe word \"temple\" has traditionally been rarely used in the English-speaking Western Christian tradition. In Irish, some pre-schism churches use the word \"teampall\". The usual word for \"church\" in the Hungarian language is \"templom\", also deriving from the same Latin root. Spanish distinguishes between the temple being the physical building for religious activity, and the church being both the physical building for religious activity and also the congregation of religious followers.\nThe principal words typically used to distinguish houses of worship in Western Christian architecture are \"abbey\", \"basilica\", \"cathedral\", \"chapel\" and \"church\". The Catholic Church has used the word temple in reference of a place of worship on rare occasions. An example is the Roman Catholic Sagrada Familia Temple in Barcelona, Spain and the Roman Catholic Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Temple in Paris, France. Another example is the Temple or Our Lady of the Pillar, a church in Guadalajara, Mexico.\nProtestantism.\nSome Protestant churches use this term; above the main entrance of the Lutheran Gustav Vasa church in Stockholm, Sweden, is a cartouche in Latin which reads \"this temple (...) was constructed by king Oscar II.\"\nBeginning in the late 18th century, following the Enlightenment, some Protestant denominations in France and elsewhere began to use the word \"temple\" to distinguish these spaces from Catholic churches. Evangelical and other Protestant churches make use of a wide variety of terms to designate their worship spaces, such as church, tabernacle or temple. Additionally, some breakaway Catholic churches such as the Mariavite Church in Poland have chosen to also designate their central church building as a temple, as in the case of the Temple of Mercy and Charity in P\u0142ock.\nLatter Day Saint movement.\nAccording to Latter Day Saints, in 1832, Joseph Smith received a revelation to restore the practice of temple worship, in a \"house of the Lord\". The Kirtland Temple was the first temple of the Latter-day Saint movement and the only one completed in Smith's lifetime, although the Nauvoo Temple was partially complete at the time of his death. The schisms stemming from a succession crisis have led to differing views about the role and use of temples between various groups with competing succession claims.\nThe Book of Mormon, which Latter Day Saints believe is a companion book of scripture with the Bible, refers to temple building in the ancient Americas by a group of people called the Nephites. Though Book of Mormon authors are not explicit about the practices in these Nephite temples, they were patterned \"after the manner of the temple of Solomon\" () and served as gathering places for significant religious and political events (e.g. Mosiah 1\u20136; 3rd Nephi 11\u201326).\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a prolific builder of temples. The LDS Church has 382 temples in various phases, which includes 211 dedicated temples (204 operating, 7 undergoing renovations), 6 with dedications scheduled, 56 under construction, 1 with a groundbreaking ceremony scheduled, and 108 others announced (not yet under construction). Latter-day Saint temples are reserved for performing and undertaking only the most holy and sacred of covenants and special of ordinances. They are distinct from meeting houses and chapels where weekly worship services are held. The temples are built and kept under strict sacredness and are not to be defiled. Thus, strict rules apply for entrance, including church membership and regular attendance. During the open-house period after its construction and before its dedication, the temple is open to the public for tours.\nOther Latter Day Saint denominations.\nVarious sects in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith have temples.\nMasonic temples.\nFreemasonry is a fraternal organization with its origins in the eighteenth century whose membership is held together by a shared set of moral and metaphysical ideals based on short role play narratives concerning the construction of King Solomon's Temple. Freemasons meet as a Lodge. Lodges meet in a Masonic Temple (in reference to King Solomon's Temple), Masonic Center or a Masonic Hall, such as Freemasons' Hall, London. Some confusion exists as Masons usually refer to a Lodge meeting as being \"in Lodge\".\nOthers.\nConvention sometimes allows the use of temple in some of the following cases:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This basin encompasses , of which are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 indigenous territories.\nThe majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have \"Amazonas\" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name \"Guiana Amazonian Park\" for French Guiana's protected rainforest area. The Amazon represents over half of the total area of remaining rainforests on Earth, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species.\nMore than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, which are subdivided into 9 different national political systems and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. Indigenous peoples make up 9% of the total population, and 60 of the groups remain largely isolated.\nLarge scale deforestation is occurring in the forest, creating different harmful effects. Economic losses due to deforestation in Brazil could be approximately 7 times higher in comparison to the cost of all commodities produced through deforestation. In 2023, the World Bank published a report proposing a non-deforestation based economic program in the region. Deforestation hurts agriculture so severely that it can lead to \"agro-suicide.\"\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Amazon\" is said to arise from a war Francisco de Orellana fought with the Tapuyas and other tribes. The women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was their custom. Orellana derived the name \"Amazonas\" from the Amazons of Greek mythology, described by Herodotus and Diodorus.\nHistory.\nBased on archaeological evidence from an excavation at Caverna da Pedra Pintada, human inhabitants first settled in the Amazon region at least 11,200 years ago. Subsequent development led to late-prehistoric settlements along the periphery of the forest by AD 1250, which induced alterations in the forest cover.\nFor a long time, it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was never more than sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil. Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book \"Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise\". She claimed that a population density of is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. The Upano Valley sites in present-day eastern Ecuador predate all known complex Amazonian societies.\nSome 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. Based on projections of food production, one estimate suggests over 8 million people living in the Amazon in 1492. By 1900, the native indigenous population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.\nThe first European to travel the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542. The BBC's \"Unnatural Histories\" presents evidence that Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. The Pre-Columbian agriculture in the Amazon Basin was sufficiently advanced to support prosperous and populous societies. It is believed that civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe, such as smallpox. This civilization was investigated by the British explorer Percy Fawcett in the early twentieth century. The results of his expeditions were inconclusive, and he disappeared mysteriously on his last trip. His name for this lost civilization was the City of Z.\nSince the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 1\u20131250, furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations. Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977, and Alceu Ranzi is credited with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre. The BBC's \"Unnatural Histories\" presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and \"terra preta\". Terra preta is found over large areas in the Amazon forest; and is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management. The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed. In the region of the Xingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.\nIn the Amazonas, there has been fighting and wars between the neighboring tribes of the Jivaro. Several tribes of the Jivaroan group, including the Shuar, practised headhunting for trophies and headshrinking. The accounts of missionaries to the area in the borderlands between Brazil and Venezuela have recounted constant infighting in the Yanomami tribes. More than a third of the Yanomamo males, on average, died from warfare.\nThe Munduruku were a warlike tribe that expanded along the Tapaj\u00f3s river and its tributaries and were feared by neighboring tribes. In the early 19th century, the Munduruku were pacified and subjugated by the Brazilians. It is documented that large war parties of the Bororo, Kayapo, Munduruku, Guaran\u00ed, and Tupi people carried out long-distance raids. Most Bororo groups were continually at war with their neighbors. In contrast, the Xingu have been described by ethnographers as a \"peaceful\" society, resorting to violence only in defense against their warlike neighbors. In the early 20th century, thirty indigenous tribes in the Amazon basin were listed as \"peaceful\" and eighty-three were specifically described as \"warlike\".\nDuring the Amazon rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as typhus and malaria, killed 40,000 native Amazonians.\nIn the 1950s, Brazilian explorer and defender of indigenous people, C\u00e2ndido Rondon, supported the Villas-B\u00f4as brothers' campaign, which faced strong opposition from the government and the ranchers of Mato Grosso and led to the establishment of the first Brazilian National Park for indigenous people along the Xingu River in 1961.\nIn 1961, British explorer Richard Mason was killed by an uncontacted Amazon tribe known as the Panar\u00e1.\nThe Mats\u00e9s made their first permanent contact with the outside world in 1969. Before that date, they were effectively at-war with the Peruvian government.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nNine countries share the Amazon basin\u2014most of the rainforest, 58.4%, is contained within the borders of Brazil. The other eight countries are Peru with 12.8%, Bolivia with 7.7%, Colombia with 7.1%, Venezuela with 6.1%, Guyana with 3.1%, Suriname with 2.5%, French Guiana with 1.4% and Ecuador with 1%.\nNatural.\nThe rainforest likely formed during the Eocene era (from 56 million years to 33.9\u00a0million years ago). It appeared following a global reduction of tropical temperatures when the Atlantic Ocean had widened sufficiently to provide a warm, moist climate to the Amazon basin. The rainforest has been in existence for at least 55 million years, and most of the region remained free of savanna-type biomes at least until the current ice age when the climate was drier and savanna more widespread.\nFollowing the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent. From 66 to 34 Mya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45\u00b0. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the Oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.\nDuring the mid-Eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch. Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin. As the Andes Mountains rose, however, a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the Solim\u00f5es Basin. Within the last 5\u201310\u00a0million years, this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch, joining the easterly flow toward the Atlantic.\nThere is evidence that there have been significant changes in the Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the last glacial maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. In present day, the Amazon receives approximately 9 feet of rainfall annually. There is a debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.\nSahara Desert dust windblown to the Amazon.\nMore than 56% of the dust fertilizing the Amazon rainforest comes from the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 depression in Northern Chad in the Sahara desert. The dust contains phosphorus, important for plant growth. The yearly Sahara dust replaces the equivalent amount of phosphorus washed away yearly in Amazon soil from rains and floods.\nNASA's CALIPSO satellite has measured the amount of dust transported by wind from the Sahara to the Amazon: an average of 182 million tons of dust are windblown out of the Sahara each year (some dust falls into the Atlantic), 15% of which of falls over the Amazon basin (22\u00a0million tons of it consisting of phosphorus).\nCALIPSO uses a laser range finder to scan the Earth's atmosphere for the vertical distribution of dust and other aerosols. and regularly tracks the Sahara-Amazon dust plume. CALIPSO has measured variations in the dust amounts transported \u2013 an 86 percent drop between the highest amount of dust transported in 2007 and the lowest in 2011. This is possibly caused by rainfall variations in the Sahel, a strip of semi-arid land on the southern border of the Sahara.\nAmazon phosphorus also comes as smoke due to biomass burning in Africa.\nBiodiversity, flora and fauna.\nWet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. One in ten known species in the world lives in the Amazon rainforest. This constitutes the largest collection of living plants and animal species in the world.\nThe region is home to about 2.5\u00a0million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals. To date, at least 40,000 plant species, 2,200 fishes, 1,294 birds, 427 mammals, 428 amphibians, and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified in the region. One in five of all bird species are found in the Amazon rainforest, and one in five of the fish species live in Amazonian rivers and streams. Scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in Brazil alone.\nThe biodiversity of plant species is the highest on Earth with one 2001 study finding a quarter square kilometer (62 acres) of Ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1,100 tree species. A study in 1999 found one square kilometer (247 acres) of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants. The average plant biomass is estimated at 356 \u00b1 47 tonnes per hectare. To date, an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued. The total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16,000.\nThe green leaf area of plants and trees in the rainforest varies by about 25% as a result of seasonal changes. Leaves expand during the dry season when sunlight is at a maximum, then undergo abscission in the cloudy wet season. These changes provide a balance of carbon between photosynthesis and respiration.\nEach hectare of the Amazon rainforest contains around 1\u00a0billion invertebrates. The number of species per hectare in the Amazon rainforest is presented in the following table:\nThe rainforest contains several species that can pose a hazard. Among the largest predatory creatures are the black caiman, jaguar, cougar, and anaconda. In the river, electric eels can produce an electric shock that can stun or kill, while piranha are known to bite and injure humans. Various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh. There are also numerous parasites and disease vectors. Vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus. Malaria, yellow fever and dengue fever can also be contracted in the Amazon region.\nThe biodiversity in the Amazon is becoming increasingly threatened, primarily by habitat loss from deforestation as well as increased frequency of fires. Over 90% of Amazonian plant and vertebrate species (13,000\u201314,000 in total) may have been impacted to some degree by fires.\nDeforestation.\nDeforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas. The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and the development of the land. In 2022, about 20% of the Amazon rainforest has already been deforested and a further 6% was \"highly degraded\". Research suggests that upon reaching about 20\u201325% (hence 0\u20135% more), the tipping point to flip it into a non-forest ecosystem \u2013 degraded savannah \u2013 (in eastern, southern and central Amazonia) will be reached. This process of savanisation would take decades to take full effect.\nPrior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.\nIn the 1970s, construction began on the Trans-Amazonian highway. This highway represented a major threat to the Amazon rainforest. The highway still has not been completed, limiting the environmental damage.\nBetween 1991 and 2000, the total area of forest lost in the Amazon rose from , with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle. Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, have been used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the largest global producer of soybeans. New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. So despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields.\nThe needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the Amazon. The first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation. The mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 ( per year) was 18% higher than in the previous five years ( per year). Although deforestation declined significantly in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004 and 2014, there has been an increase to the present day.\nBrazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, has supported the relaxation of regulations placed on agricultural land. He has used his time in office to allow for more deforestation and more exploitation of the Amazon's rich natural resources. Deforestation reached a 15 year high in 2021.\nSince the discovery of fossil fuel reservoirs in the Amazon rainforest, oil drilling activity has steadily increased, peaking in the Western Amazon in the 1970s and ushering another drilling boom in the 2000s. Oil companies have to set up their operations by opening new roads through the forests, which often contributes to deforestation in the region. 9.4% of the territory of the Amazon is affected by oil fields.\nMining is also a major driver of deforestation. 17% of the area of the Amazon Rainforest is affected by mining.\nThe transition to solar and wind energy, digitalization, raised the demand for cassiterite (the main ore of tin used also for financing gold mining), manganese and copper, which attracrted many illegal miners to the Amazon. This led to deforestation, different environmental and social problems. Hydropower also creates significant problems in the Amazon. Such activities are defined by the World Rainforest Movement as \"Green extractivism\".\nThe European Union\u2013Mercosur free trade agreement, which would form one of the world's largest free trade areas, has been denounced by environmental activists and indigenous rights campaigners. The fear is that the deal could lead to more deforestation of the Amazon rainforest as it expands market access to Brazilian beef.\nAccording to a November 2021 report by Brazil's INPE, based on satellite data, deforestation has increased by 22% over 2020 and is at its highest level since 2006.\n2019 fires.\nThere were 72,843 fires in Brazil in 2019, with more than half within the Amazon region. In August 2019 there were a record number of fires. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose more than 88% in June 2019 compared with the same month in 2018.\nThe increased area of fire-impacted forest coincided with a relaxation of environmental regulations from the Brazilian government. Notably, before those regulations were put in place in 2008 the fire-impacted area was also larger compared to the regulation period of 2009\u20132018. As these fire continue to move closer to the heart of the Amazon basin, their impact on biodiversity will only increase in scale, as the cumulative fire-impacted area is correlated with the number of species impacted.\nConservation and climate change.\nEnvironmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest, and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming. Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and 10% of the carbon stores in ecosystems \u2013 of the order of 1.1 \u00d7 1011 metric tonnes of carbon. Amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0.62 \u00b1 0.37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996. In 2021 it was reported that the Amazon for the first time emitted more greenhouse gases than it absorbed. Though often referenced as producing more than a quarter of the Earth's oxygen, this often stated, but misused statistic actually refers to oxygen turnover. The net contribution of the ecosystem is approximately zero.\nOne computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the Amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures, leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100., and severe economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts of not averting the tipping point. However, simulations of Amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases. The result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened through the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation.\nIn 1989, environmentalist C.M. Peters and two colleagues stated there is economic as well as biological incentive to protecting the rainforest. One hectare in the Peruvian Amazon has been calculated to have a value of $6820 if intact forest is sustainably harvested for fruits, latex, and timber; $1000 if clear-cut for commercial timber (not sustainably harvested); or $148 if used as cattle pasture.\nAs indigenous territories continue to be destroyed by deforestation and ecocide (such as in the Peruvian Amazon), indigenous peoples' rainforest communities continue to disappear, while others, like the Urarina continue to struggle to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories. Meanwhile, the relationship between non-human primates in the subsistence and symbolism of indigenous lowland South American peoples has gained increased attention, as have ethno-biology and community-based conservation efforts.\nFrom 2002 to 2006, the conserved land in the Amazon rainforest almost tripled and deforestation rates dropped up to 60%. About have been put onto some sort of conservation, which adds up to a current amount of .\nIn April 2019, the Ecuadorian court stopped oil exploration activities in of the Amazon rainforest.\nIn July 2019, the Ecuadorian court forbade the government to sell territory with forests to oil companies.\nIn September 2019, the US and Brazil agreed to promote private-sector development in the Amazon. They also pledged a $100m biodiversity conservation fund for the Amazon led by the private sector. Brazil's foreign minister stated that opening the rainforest to economic development was the only way to protect it.\nA 2009 study found that a 4\u00a0\u00b0C rise (above pre-industrial levels) in global temperatures by 2100 would kill 85% of the Amazon rainforest while a temperature rise of 3\u00a0\u00b0C would kill some 75% of the Amazon.\nA new study by an international team of environmental scientists in the Brazilian Amazon shows that protection of freshwater biodiversity can be increased by up to 600% through integrated freshwater-terrestrial planning \nDeforestation in the Amazon rainforest region has a negative impact on local climate. It was one of the main causes of the severe drought of 2014\u20132015 in Brazil. This is because the moisture from the forests is important to the rainfall in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. Half of the rainfall in the Amazon area is produced by the forests.\nResults of a 2021 scientific synthesis indicate that, in terms of global warming, the Amazon basin with the Amazon rainforest is currently emitting more greenhouse gases than it absorbs overall. Climate change impacts and human activities in the area \u2013 mainly wildfires, current land-use and deforestation \u2013 are causing a release of forcing agents that likely result in a net warming effect.&lt;ref name=\"10.3389/ffgc.2021.618401\"&gt; Available under https:// .&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn 2022 the supreme court of Ecuador decided that \"\"under no circumstances can a project be carried out that generates excessive sacrifices to the collective rights of communities and nature.\" It also required the government to respect the opinion of Indigenous peoples of the Americas about different industrial projects on their land. Advocates of the decision argue that it will have consequences far beyond Ecuador. In general, ecosystems are in better shape when indigenous peoples own or manage the land.\nDue to the conservation policies of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in the first 10 months of 2023 deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon decreased by around 50% compared to the same period in 2022. This was despite a severe drought, one of the worst on record, that exacerbated the situation. Climate change, El Nino, deforestation increases the likelihood of drought condition in the Amazon.\nAccording to Amazon Conservation's MAAP forest monitoring program, the deforestation rate in the Amazon from the January 1 to November 8, 2023, decreased by 56% in comparison to the same period in 2022. The main cause is the decline in deforestation rate in Brazil, due to the government's policies, while Columbia, Peru and Bolivia also reduced deforestation.\nIn January 2024 published data showed a 50% decline in deforestation rate in the Amazon rainforest and 43% rise in vegetation loss in the neighbor Cerrado during the year of 2023 in comparison to 2022. Both biomes together lose 12,980\u00a0km\u00b2, 18% less than in 2022.\nRemote sensing.\nThe use of remotely sensed data is dramatically improving conservationists' knowledge of the Amazon basin. Given the objectivity and lowered costs of satellite-based land cover and -change analysis, it appears likely that remote sensing technology will be an integral part of assessing the extents, locations and damage of deforestation in the basin. Furthermore, remote sensing is the best and perhaps only possible way to study the Amazon on a large scale.\nThe use of remote sensing for the conservation of the Amazon is also being used by the indigenous tribes of the basin to protect their tribal lands from commercial interests. Using handheld GPS devices and programs like Google Earth, members of the Trio Tribe, who live in the rainforests of southern Suriname, map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims. Currently, most tribes in the Amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries, making it easier for commercial ventures to target their territories.\nTo accurately map the Amazon's biomass and subsequent carbon-related emissions, the classification of tree growth stages within different parts of the forest is crucial. In 2006, Tatiana Kuplich organized the trees of the Amazon into four categories: mature forest, regenerating forest [less than three years], regenerating forest [between three and five years of regrowth], and regenerating forest [eleven to eighteen years of continued development]. The researcher used a combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Thematic Mapper (TM) to accurately place the different portions of the Amazon into one of the four classifications.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Impact of early 21st-century Amazon droughts.\nIn 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years, and there were indications that 2006 may have been a second successive year of drought. A 2006 article in the UK newspaper \"The Independent\" reported the Woods Hole Research Center results, showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argued in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a \"tipping point\" where it would irreversibly start to die. It concluded that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate. A study published in \"Nature Communications\" in October 2020 found that about 40% of the Amazon rainforest is at risk of becoming a savanna-like ecosystem due to reduced rainfall. A study published in \"Nature climate change\" provided direct empirical evidence that more than three-quarters of the Amazon rainforest has been losing resilience since the early 2000s, risking dieback with profound implications for biodiversity, carbon storage and climate change at a global scale. Research from 2025 using hundreds of climate-model simulations says even passing 1.5C of global warming temporarily would trigger a significant risk of Amazon forest dieback.\nAccording to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest fires.\nIn 2010, the Amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought, in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought. The affected region was approximately of rainforest, compared with in 2005. The 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off, whereas in 2005, the drought was focused on the southwestern part. The findings were published in the journal \"Science\". In a typical year, the Amazon absorbs 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide; during 2005 instead 5 gigatons were released and in 2010 8 gigatons were released. Additional severe droughts occurred in 2010, 2015, and 2016.\nIn 2019 Brazil's protections of the Amazon rainforest were slashed, resulting in a severe loss of trees. According to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE), deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose more than 50% in the first three months of 2020 compared to the same three-month period in 2019.\nIn 2020, a 17 percent rise was noted in the Amazon wildfires, marking the worst start to the fire season in a decade. The first 10 days of August 2020 witnessed 10,136 fires. An analysis of the government figures reflected 81 per cent increase in fires in federal reserves, in comparison with the same period in 2019. However, President Jair Bolsonaro turned down the existence of fires, calling it a \"lie\", despite the data produced by his own government. Satellites in September recorded 32,017 hotspots in the world's largest rainforest, a 61% rise from the same month in 2019. In addition, October saw a huge surge in the number of hotspots in the forest (more than 17,000 fires are burning in the Amazon's rainforest) \u2013 with more than double the amount detected in the same month last year.\nPossibility of forest-friendly economy.\nExperts consider a forest-friendly economy the best method to sustain the Brazilian agricultural sector, because deforestation disrupts rainfall patterns and increases temperatures, hurting agriculture. This may lead to \"agro-suicide.\" Even irrigation can not solve the problem, because for irrigation farmers need water, which is already in short supply.\nIn 2023 the World Bank, published a report named: \"A Balancing Act for Brazil's Amazonian States: An Economic Memorandum\". The report stating that economic losses due to deforestation in Brazil could reach around 317 billion dollars per year, approximately 7 times higher in comparison to the cost of all commodities produced through deforestation, proposed non-deforestation based economic program in the region of the Amazon rainforest.\nSilvopasture (integrating trees, forage and grazing) can help to stop deforestation in the region.\nAccording to WWF, ecotourism could help the Amazon to reduce deforestation and climate change. Ecotourism is currently still little practiced in the Amazon, partly due to lack of information about places where implementation is possible. Ecotourism is a sector that can also be taken up by the Indigenous community in the Amazon as a source of income and revenue. An ecotourism project in the Brazilian section of the rainforest had been under consideration by Brazil's State Secretary for the Environment and Sustainable Development in 2009, along the Aripuan\u00e3 River, in the Aripuan\u00e3 Sustainable Development Reserve. Also, some community-based ecotourism exists in the Mamirau\u00e1 Sustainable Development Reserve. Ecotourism is also practiced in the Peruvian section of the rainforest. A few ecolodges are for instance present between Cusco and Madre de Dios.\nIn May 2023 Brazil's bank federation decided to implement a new sustainability standard demanding from meatpackers to ensure their meat is not coming from illegally deforested area. Credits will not be given to those who will not meet the new standards. The decision came after the European Union decides to implement regulations to stop deforestation. Brazil beef exporters, said the standard is not just because it is not applied to land owners. 21 banks representing 81% of the credit market in Brazil agree to follow those rules.\nAccording to a statement of the Colombian government deforestation rates in the Colombian Amazon fell by 70% in the first 9 months of 2023 compared to the same period in the previous year, what can be attributed to the conservation policies of the government. One of them is paying local residents for conserving the forest.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "48143", "revid": "140154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48143", "title": "Proxy ARP", "text": "Address resolution protocol for proxy servers\nProxy ARP is a technique by which a proxy server on a given network answers the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) queries for an IP address that is not on that network. The proxy is aware of the location of the traffic's destination and offers its own MAC address as the (ostensibly final) destination. The traffic directed to the proxy address is then typically routed by the proxy to the intended destination via another interface or via a tunnel.\nThe process, which results in the proxy server responding with its own MAC address to an ARP request for a different IP address for proxying purposes, is sometimes referred to as \"publishing\". \nUses.\nBelow are some typical uses for proxy ARP:\nAssume an Ethernet broadcast domain (e.g., a group of stations connected to the same hub or switch (VLAN)) using a certain IPv4 address range (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24, where 192.168.0.1 \u2013 192.168.0.127 are assigned to wired nodes). One or more of the nodes is an access router accepting dialup or VPN connections. The access router gives the dial-up nodes IP addresses in the range 192.168.0.128\u00a0\u2013 192.168.0.254; for this example, assume a dial-up node gets IP address 192.168.0.254.\nThe access router uses proxy ARP to make the dial-up node present in the subnet without being wired into the Ethernet: the access router 'publishes' its own MAC address for 192.168.0.254. Now, when another node wired into the Ethernet wants to talk to the dial-up node, it will ask on the network for the MAC address of 192.168.0.254 and find the access router's MAC address. It will therefore send its IP packets to the access router, and the access router will know to pass them on to the particular dial-up node. All dial-up nodes therefore appear to the wired Ethernet nodes as if they are wired into the same Ethernet subnet.\nAssume a station (e.g., a server) with an interface (10.0.0.2) connected to a network (10.0.0.0/24). Certain applications may require multiple IP addresses on the server. Provided the addresses have to be from the 10.0.0.0/24 range, the way the problem is solved is through proxy ARP. Additional addresses (say, 10.0.0.230\u00a0\u2013 10.0.0.240) are aliased to the loopback interface of the server (or assigned to special interfaces, the latter typically being the case with VMware/UML/jails/vservers/other virtual server environments) and 'published' on the 10.0.0.2 interface (although many operating systems allow direct allocation of multiple addresses to one interface, thus eliminating the need for such workarounds).\nIn this scenario a firewall can be configured with a single IP address. One simple example of a use for this would be placing a firewall in front of a single host or group of hosts on a subnetwork. Example: A network (10.0.0.0/8) has a server (10.0.0.20) that should be protected. A proxy ARP firewall can be placed in front of the server. In this way the server is put behind a firewall without having to make any further changes to the network.\nIn case of Mobile-IP the Home Agent uses proxy ARP in order to receive messages on behalf of the Mobile Node so that it can forward the appropriate message to the actual mobile node's address (care-of address).\nA setup that involves two physical segments sharing the same IP subnet and connected together via a router. This use is documented in RFC 1027.\nARP manipulation techniques are the basis for protocols providing redundancy on broadcast networks (e.g., Ethernet), most notably Common Address Redundancy Protocol and Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol.\nDisadvantages.\nDisadvantage of proxy ARP include scalability as ARP resolution by a proxy is required for every device routed in this manner, and reliability, as no fallback mechanism is present, and masquerading can be confusing in some environments. \nProxy ARP can create DoS attacks on networks if misconfigured. For example, a misconfigured router with proxy ARP has the ability to receive packets destined for other hosts (as it gives its own MAC address in response to ARP requests for other hosts/routers), but may not have the ability to correctly forward these packets on to their final destination, thus blackholing the traffic.\nProxy ARP can hide device misconfigurations, such as a missing or incorrect default gateway.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The computer also includes memory and input/output (I/O) circuitry together mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB). Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors such as the MOS Technology 6502, Zilog Z80, and Intel 8088. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive\nMany microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). An early use of the term \"personal computer\" in 1962 predates microprocessor-based designs. \"(See \"Personal Computer: Computers at Companies\" reference below)\". A \"microcomputer\" used as an embedded control system may have no human-readable input and output devices. \"Personal computer\" may be used generically or may denote an IBM PC compatible machine.\nThe abbreviation \"micro\" was common during the 1970s and 1980s, but has since fallen out of common usage.\nOrigins.\nThe term \"microcomputer\" came into popular use after the introduction of the minicomputer, although Isaac Asimov used the term in his short story \"The Dying Night\" as early as 1956 (published in \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" in July that year). Most notably, the microcomputer replaced the many separate components that made up the minicomputer's CPU with one integrated microprocessor chip.\nIn 1973, the French Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) was looking for a computer able to measure agricultural hygrometry. To answer this request, a team of French engineers of the computer technology company R2E, led by its Head of Development, Fran\u00e7ois Gernelle, created the first available microprocessor-based microcomputer, the Micral N. The same year the company filed their patents with the term \"Micro-ordinateur\", a literal equivalent of \"Microcomputer\", to designate a solid state machine designed with a microprocessor.\nIn the US the earliest models such as the Altair 8800 were often sold as kits to be assembled by the user, and came with as little as 256 bytes of RAM, and no input/output devices other than indicator lights and switches, useful as a proof of concept to demonstrate what such a simple device could do. \nAs microprocessors and semiconductor memory became less expensive, microcomputers grew cheaper and easier to use.\nAll these improvements in cost and usability resulted in an explosion in their popularity during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nA large number of computer makers packaged microcomputers for use in small business applications. By 1979, many companies such as Cromemco, Processor Technology, IMSAI, North Star Computers, Southwest Technical Products Corporation, Ohio Scientific, Altos Computer Systems, Morrow Designs and others produced systems designed for resourceful end users or consulting firms to deliver business systems such as accounting, database management and word processing to small businesses. This allowed businesses unable to afford leasing of a minicomputer or time-sharing service the opportunity to automate business functions, without (usually) hiring a full-time staff to operate the computers. A representative system of this era would have used an S100 bus, an 8-bit processor such as an Intel 8080 or Zilog Z80, and either CP/M or MP/M operating system.\nThe increasing availability and power of desktop computers for personal use attracted the attention of more software developers. As the industry matured, the market for personal computers standardized around IBM PC compatibles running MS-DOS, and later Windows. Modern desktop computers, video game consoles, laptops, tablet PCs, and many types of handheld devices, including mobile phones, pocket calculators, and industrial embedded systems, may all be considered examples of microcomputers according to the definition given above.\nColloquial use of the term.\nBy the early 2000s, everyday use of the expression \"microcomputer\" (and in particular \"micro\") declined significantly from its peak in the mid-1980s. The term is most commonly associated with the most popular 8-bit home computers (such as the Apple II, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, BBC Micro, and TRS-80) and small-business CP/M-based microcomputers.\nIn colloquial usage, \"microcomputer\" has been largely supplanted by the term \"personal computer\" or \"PC\", which specifies a computer that has been designed to be used by one individual at a time, a term first coined in 1959. IBM first promoted the term \"personal computer\" to differentiate the IBM PC from CP/M-based microcomputers likewise targeted at the small-business market, and also IBM's own mainframes and minicomputers. However, following its release, the IBM PC itself was widely imitated, as well as the term. The component parts were commonly available to producers and the BIOS was reverse engineered through cleanroom design techniques. IBM PC compatible \"clones\" became commonplace, and the terms \"personal computer\", and especially \"PC\", stuck with the general public, often specifically for a computer compatible with DOS (or nowadays Windows).\nDescription.\nMonitors, keyboards and other devices for input and output may be integrated or separate. Computer memory in the form of RAM, and at least one other less volatile, memory storage device are usually combined with the CPU on a system bus in one unit. Other devices that make up a complete microcomputer system include batteries, a power supply unit, a keyboard and various input/output devices used to convey information to and from a human operator (printers, monitors, human interface devices). Microcomputers are designed to serve only one user at a time, although they can often be modified with software or hardware to concurrently serve more than one user. Microcomputers fit well on or under desks or tables, so that they are within easy access of users. Bigger computers like minicomputers, mainframes, and supercomputers, however, take up large cabinets or even dedicated rooms.\nA microcomputer comes equipped with at least one type of data storage, usually RAM. Although some microcomputers (particularly early 8-bit home micros) perform tasks using RAM alone, some form of secondary storage is normally desirable. In the early days of home micros, this was often a data cassette deck (in many cases as an external unit). Later, secondary storage (particularly in the form of floppy disk and hard disk drives) were built into the microcomputer case.\nHistory.\nTTL precursors.\nAlthough they did not contain any microprocessors, but were built around transistor-transistor logic (TTL), Hewlett-Packard calculators as far back as 1968 had various levels of programmability comparable to microcomputers. The HP 9100B (1968) had rudimentary conditional (if) statements, statement line numbers, jump statements (go to), registers that could be used as variables, and primitive subroutines. The programming language resembled assembly language in many ways. Later models incrementally added more features, including the BASIC programming language (HP 9830A in 1971). Some models had tape storage and small printers. However, displays were limited to one line at a time. The HP 9100A was referred to as a personal computer in an advertisement in a 1968 Science magazine, but that advertisement was quickly dropped. HP was reluctant to sell them as \"computers\" because the perception at that time was that a computer had to be big in size to be powerful, and thus decided to market them as calculators. Additionally, at that time, people were more likely to buy calculators than computers, and, purchasing agents also preferred the term \"calculator\" because purchasing a \"computer\" required additional layers of purchasing authority approvals.\nThe Datapoint 2200, made by CTC in 1970, was also comparable to microcomputers. While it contains no microprocessor, the instruction set of its custom TTL processor was the basis of the instruction set for the Intel 8008, and for practical purposes the system behaves approximately as if it contains an 8008. This is because Intel was the contractor in charge of developing the Datapoint's CPU, but ultimately CTC rejected the 8008 design because it needed 20 support chips.\nAnother early system, the Kenbak-1, was released in 1971. Like the Datapoint 2200, it used small-scale integrated transistor\u2013transistor logic instead of a microprocessor. It was marketed as an educational and hobbyist tool, but it was not a commercial success; production ceased shortly after introduction.\nEarly microcomputers.\nIn late 1972, a French team headed by Fran\u00e7ois Gernelle within a small company, R\u00e9alisations &amp; Etudes Electroniques (R2E), developed and patented a computer based on a microprocessor \u2013 the Intel 8008 8-bit microprocessor. This Micral-N was marketed in early 1973 as a \"Micro-ordinateur\" or \"microcomputer\", mainly for scientific and process-control applications. About a hundred Micral-N were installed in the next two years, followed by a new version based on the Intel 8080. Meanwhile, another French team developed the Alvan, a small computer for office automation which found clients in banks and other sectors. The first version was based on LSI chips with an Intel 8008 as peripheral controller (keyboard, monitor and printer), before adopting the Zilog Z80 as main processor.\nIn early 1973, Sord Computer Corporation (now Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation) completed the SMP80/08, which used the Intel 8008 microprocessor. The SMP80/08, however, did not have a commercial release. After the first general-purpose microprocessor, the Intel 8080, was announced in April 1974, Sord announced the SMP80/x, the first microcomputer to use the 8080, in May 1974.\nVirtually all early microcomputers were essentially boxes with lights and switches; one had to read and understand binary numbers and machine language to program and use them (the Datapoint 2200 was a striking exception, bearing a modern design based on a monitor, keyboard, and tape and disk drives). Of the early \"box of switches\"-type microcomputers, the MITS Altair 8800 (1975) was arguably the most famous. Most of these simple, early microcomputers were sold as electronic kits\u2014bags full of loose components which the buyer had to solder together before the system could be used.\nThe period from about 1971 to 1976 is sometimes called the of microcomputers. Many companies such as DEC, National Semiconductor, Texas Instruments offered their microcomputers for use in terminal control, peripheral device interface control and industrial machine control. There were also machines for engineering development and hobbyist personal use. In 1975, the Processor Technology SOL-20 was designed, which consisted of one board which included all the parts of the computer system. The SOL-20 had built-in EPROM software which eliminated the need for rows of switches and lights. The MITS Altair just mentioned played an instrumental role in sparking significant hobbyist interest, which itself eventually led to the founding and success of many well-known personal computer hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft and Apple Computer. Although the Altair itself was only a mild commercial success, it helped spark a huge industry.\nHome computers.\nBy 1977, the introduction of the second microcomputer generation as consumer goods, known as home computers, made them considerably easier to use than their predecessors because their predecessors' operation often demanded thorough familiarity with practical electronics. The ability to connect to a monitor (screen) or TV set allowed visual manipulation of text and numbers. The BASIC language, which was easier to learn and use than raw machine language, became a standard feature. These features were already common in minicomputers, with which many hobbyists and early produces were familiar.\nIn 1979, the launch of the VisiCalc spreadsheet (initially for the Apple II) first turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool. After the 1981 release by IBM of its IBM PC, the term personal computer became generally used for microcomputers compatible with the IBM PC architecture (IBM PC\u2013compatible).\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is characterized by a fast tempo, complex chord progressions\u2014with rapid chord changes, changes of key, and substitute chords\u2014along with virtuosic improvisation based on a combination of harmonic structure, scales, and occasional references to the melody.\nBebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular, dance-oriented swing music-style to a new \"musician's music\" that was not as danceable and demanded close listening. As bebop was not intended for dancing, it enabled the musicians to play at faster tempos. Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords, extended chords, chord substitutions, asymmetrical phrasing, and intricate melodies. Bebop groups used rhythm sections in a way that expanded their role. Whereas the key ensemble of the swing music era was the big band of 16\u201318 musicians playing in an ensemble-based style, the classic bebop group was a small combo that consisted of saxophone (alto or tenor), trumpet, piano, guitar, double bass, and drums playing music in which the ensemble played a supportive role for soloists. Rather than play heavily arranged music, bebop musicians typically played the melody of a composition (called the \"head\") with the accompaniment of the rhythm section, followed by a section in which each of the performers improvised a solo, then returned to the melody at the end of the composition.\nSome of the most influential bebop artists, who were typically composer-performers, are alto sax players Charlie Parker and Sonny Stitt; tenor sax players Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, and James Moody; clarinet player Buddy DeFranco; trumpeters Fats Navarro, Miles Davis, and Dizzy Gillespie; pianists Bud Powell, Barry Harris and Thelonious Monk; trombonist J.J. Johnson; electric guitarist Charlie Christian; and drummers Kenny Clarke, Max Roach, and Art Blakey.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"bebop\" is derived from nonsense syllables (vocables) used in scat singing; the first known example of \"bebop\" being used was in McKinney's Cotton Pickers' \"Four or Five Times\", recorded in 1928. It appears again in a 1936 recording of \"I'se a Muggin'\" by Jack Teagarden. A variation, \"rebop\", appears in several 1939 recordings. The first known print appearance also occurred in 1939, but the term was little used subsequently until applied to the music now associated with it in the mid-1940s. Thelonious Monk claims that the original title \"Bip Bop,\" for his composition better known as \"52nd Street Theme,\" was the origin of the name \"bebop.\"\nSome researchers speculate that it was a term used by Charlie Christian because it sounded like something he hummed along with his playing. Dizzy Gillespie stated that the audiences coined the name after hearing him scat the then-nameless compositions to his players and the press ultimately picked it up, using it as an official term: \"People, when they'd wanna ask for those numbers and didn't know the name, would ask for bebop.\" Another theory is that it derives from the cry of \"Arriba! Arriba!\" used by Latin American bandleaders of the period to encourage their bands. At times, the terms \"bebop\" and \"rebop\" were used interchangeably. (Although rebop differed from bebop with its more impressionist use of discordant chords.) By 1945, the use of \"bebop\"/\"rebop\" as nonsense syllables was widespread in R&amp;B music, for instance Lionel Hampton's \"Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop\". The bebop musician or bopper became a stock character in jokes of the 1950s, overlapping with the beatnik.\nInstrumentation.\nThe classic bebop combo consisted of saxophone, trumpet, double bass, drums and piano. This was a format used (and popularized) by both Parker (alto sax) and Gillespie (trumpet) in their 1940s groups and recordings, sometimes augmented by an extra saxophonist or guitar (electric or acoustic), occasionally adding other horns (often a trombone) or other strings (usually violin) or dropping an instrument and leaving only a quartet. This was in stark contrast to the large ensembles favored during the swing era.\nMusical style.\nBebop differed drastically from the straightforward compositions of the swing era and was instead characterized by fast tempos, asymmetrical phrasing, intricate melodies, and rhythm sections that expanded on their role as tempo-keepers. The music itself seemed jarringly different to the ears of the public, who were used to the bouncy, organized, danceable compositions of Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller during the swing era. Instead, bebop appeared to sound racing, nervous, erratic and often fragmented.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Bebop\" was a label that certain journalists later gave it, but we never labeled the music. It was just modern music, we would call it. We wouldn't call it anything, really, just music.\nWhile swing music tended to feature orchestrated big band arrangements, bebop music highlighted improvisation. Typically, a theme (a \"head,\" often the main melody of a pop or jazz standard of the swing era) would be presented together at the beginning and the end of each piece, with improvisational solos based on the chords of the compositions. Thus, the majority of a piece in bebop style would be improvisation, the only threads holding the work together being the underlying harmonies played by the rhythm section. Sometimes improvisation included references to the original melody or to other well-known melodic lines (\"quotes,\" \"licks\" or \"riffs\"). Sometimes they were entirely original, spontaneous melodies from start to finish.\nChord progressions for bebop compositions were often taken directly from popular swing-era compositions and reused with a new and more complex melody, forming new compositions (see contrafact). This practice was already well-established in earlier jazz, but came to be central to the bebop style. The style made use of several relatively common chord progressions, such as blues (at base, I-IV-V, but infused with II-V motion) and \"rhythm changes\" (I-VI-II-V, the chords to the 1930s pop standard \"I Got Rhythm\"). Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show compositions. Bebop chord voicings often dispensed with the root and fifth tones, instead basing them on the leading intervals that defined the tonality of the chord. That opened up creative possibilities for harmonic improvisation such as tritone substitutions and use of diminished scale based improvised lines that could resolve to the key center in numerous and surprising ways.\nBebop musicians also employed several harmonic devices not typical of previous jazz. Complicated harmonic substitutions for more basic chords became commonplace. These substitutions often emphasized certain dissonant intervals such as the flat ninth, sharp ninth or the sharp eleventh/tritone. This unprecedented harmonic development which took place in bebop is often traced back to a transcendent moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing \"Cherokee\" at Clark Monroe's Uptown House, New York, in early 1942. As described by Parker:\nI'd been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used ... and I kept thinking there's bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes. I couldn't play it... I was working over \"Cherokee\", and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive.\nGerhard Kubik postulates that the harmonic development in bebop sprang from the blues, and other African-related tonal sensibilities, rather than twentieth century Western art music, as some have suggested. Kubik states: \"Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker's] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories. Bebop musicians eliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices.\" Samuel Floyd states that blues were both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about three main developments:\nSome of the harmonic innovations in bebop appear similar to innovations in Western \"serious\" music, from Claude Debussy to Arnold Schoenberg, although bebop has few direct borrowings from classical music and appears to largely revive tonal-harmonic ideas taken from the blues in a basically non-Western approach rooted in African traditions. However, bebop probably drew on many sources. An insightful YouTube video with Jimmy Raney, a jazz guitarist who played with Charlie Parker, describes how Parker would listen to the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, a leading 20th century classical composer. Raney describes Parker's knowledge of Bart\u00f3k and Arnold Schoenberg, in particular Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire, and says that a section from Bart\u00f3k's Fifth Quartet sounded a lot like some of Parker's jazz improvisation.\nHistory.\nSwing era influences.\nBebop grew out of the culmination of trends that had been occurring within swing music since the mid-1930s: less explicit timekeeping by the drummer, with the primary rhythmic pulse moving from the bass drum to the ride cymbal; a changing role for the piano away from rhythmic density towards accents and fills; less ornate horn section arrangements, trending towards riffs and more support for the underlying rhythm; more emphasis on freedom for soloists; and increasing harmonic sophistication in arrangements used by some bands. The path towards rhythmically streamlined, solo-oriented swing was blazed by the territory bands of the southwest with Kansas City as their musical capital; their music was based on blues and other simple chord changes, riff-based in its approach to melodic lines and solo accompaniment, and expressing an approach adding melody and harmony to swing rather than the other way around. Ability to play sustained, high energy, and creative solos was highly valued for this newer style and the basis of intense competition. Swing-era jam sessions and \"cutting contests\" in Kansas City became legendary. The Kansas City approach to swing was epitomized by the Count Basie Orchestra, which came to national prominence in 1937.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBebop wasn't developed in any deliberate way.\n\u2014Thelonious Monk\nOne young admirer of the Basie orchestra in Kansas City was a teenage alto saxophone player named Charlie Parker. He was especially enthralled by their tenor saxophone player Lester Young, who played long flowing melodic lines that wove in and out of the chordal structure of the composition but somehow always made musical sense. Young was equally daring with his rhythm and phrasing as with his approach to harmonic structures in his solos. He would frequently repeat simple two or three note figures, with shifting rhythmic accents expressed by volume, articulation, or tone. His phrasing was far removed from the two or four bar phrases that horn players had used until then. They would often be extended to an odd number of measures, overlapping the musical stanzas suggested by the harmonic structure. He would take a breath in the middle of a phrase, using the pause, or \"free space\", as a creative device. The overall effect was that his solos were something floating above the rest of the music, rather than something springing from it at intervals suggested by the ensemble sound. When the Basie orchestra burst onto the national scene with its 1937 recordings and widely broadcast New York engagements, it gained a national following, with legions of saxophone players striving to imitate Young, drummers striving to imitate Jo Jones, piano players striving to imitate Basie, and trumpet players striving to imitate Buck Clayton. Parker played along with the new Basie recordings on a Victrola until he could play Young's solos note for note.\nIn the late 1930s the Duke Ellington Orchestra and the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra were exposing the music world to harmonically sophisticated musical arrangements by Billy Strayhorn and Sy Oliver, respectively, which implied chords as much as they spelled them out. That understatement of harmonically sophisticated chords would soon be used by young musicians exploring the new musical language of bebop.\nThe brilliant technique and harmonic sophistication of pianist Art Tatum inspired young musicians including Charlie Parker and Bud Powell. In his early days in New York, Parker held a job washing dishes at an establishment where Tatum had a regular gig.\nOne of the divergent trends of the swing era was a resurgence of small ensembles playing \"head\" arrangements, following the approach used with Basie's big band. The small band format lent itself to more impromptu experimentation and more extended solos than did the bigger, more highly arranged bands. The 1939 recording of \"Body and Soul\" by Coleman Hawkins with a small band featured an extended saxophone solo with minimal reference to the theme that was unique in recorded jazz, and which would become characteristic of bebop. That solo showed a sophisticated harmonic exploration of the composition, with implied passing chords. Hawkins would eventually go on to lead the first formal recording of the bebop style in early 1944.\nGoing beyond swing in New York.\nAs the 1930s turned to the 1940s, Parker went to New York as a featured player in the Jay McShann Orchestra. In New York he found other musicians who were exploring the harmonic and melodic limits of their music, including Dizzy Gillespie, a Roy Eldridge-influenced trumpet player who, like Parker, was exploring ideas based on upper chord intervals, beyond the seventh chords that had traditionally defined jazz harmony. While Gillespie was with Cab Calloway, he practiced with bassist Milt Hinton and developed some of the key harmonic and chordal innovations that would be the cornerstones of the new music; Parker did the same with bassist Gene Ramey while with McShann's group. Guitarist Charlie Christian, who had arrived in New York in 1939 was, like Parker, an innovator extending a southwestern style. Christian's major influence was in the realm of rhythmic phrasing. Christian commonly emphasized weak beats and off beats and often ended his phrases on the second half of the fourth beat. Christian experimented with asymmetrical phrasing, which was to become a core element of the new bop style.\nBud Powell was pushing forward with a rhythmically streamlined, harmonically sophisticated, virtuosic piano style and Thelonious Monk was adapting the new harmonic ideas to his style that was rooted in Harlem stride piano playing.\nDrummers such as Kenny Clarke and Max Roach were extending the path set by Jo Jones, adding the ride cymbal to the high hat cymbal as a primary timekeeper and reserving the bass drum for accents. Bass drum accents were colloquially termed \"bombs\", which referenced events in the world outside of New York as the new music was being developed. The new style of drumming supported and responded to soloists with accents and fills, almost like a shifting call and response. This change increased the importance of the string bass. Now, the bass not only maintained the music's harmonic foundation, but also became responsible for establishing a metronomic rhythmic foundation by playing a \"walking\" bass line of four quarter notes to the bar. While small swing ensembles commonly functioned without a bassist, the new bop style required a bass in every small ensemble.\nThe kindred spirits developing the new music gravitated to sessions at Minton's Playhouse, where Monk and Clarke were in the house band, and Monroe's Uptown House, where Max Roach was in the house band. Part of the atmosphere created at jams like the ones found at Minton's Playhouse was an air of exclusivity: the \"regular\" musicians would often reharmonize the standards, add complex rhythmic and phrasing devices into their melodies, or \"heads\", and play them at breakneck tempos in order to exclude those whom they considered outsiders or simply weaker players. These pioneers of the new music (which would later be termed \"bebop\" or \"bop\", although Parker himself never used the term, feeling it demeaned the music) began exploring advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords and chord substitutions. The bop musicians advanced these techniques with a more freewheeling, intricate and often arcane approach. Bop improvisers built upon the phrasing ideas first brought to attention by Lester Young's soloing style. They would often deploy phrases over an odd number of bars and overlap their phrases across bar lines and across major harmonic cadences. Christian and the other early boppers would also begin stating a harmony in their improvised line before it appeared in the song form being outlined by the rhythm section. This momentary dissonance creates a strong sense of forward motion in the improvisation. The sessions also attracted top musicians in the swing idiom such as Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Ben Webster, Roy Eldridge, and Don Byas. Byas became the first tenor saxophone player to fully assimilate the new bebop style in his playing. In 1944 the crew of innovators was joined by Dexter Gordon, a tenor saxophone player from the west coast in New York with the Louis Armstrong band, and a young trumpet player attending the Juilliard School of Music, Miles Davis.\nEarly recordings.\nBebop originated as \"musicians' music,\" played by musicians with other money-making gigs who did not care about the commercial potential of the new music. It did not attract the attention of major record labels nor was it intended to. Some of the early bebop was recorded informally. Some sessions at Minton's in 1941 were recorded, with Thelonious Monk alongside an assortment of musicians including Joe Guy, Hot Lips Page, Roy Eldridge, Don Byas, and Charlie Christian. Christian is featured in recordings from May 12, 1941 (Esoteric ES 548). Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were both participants at a recorded jam session hosted by Billy Eckstine on February 15, 1943, and Parker at another Eckstine jam session on February 28, 1943 (Stash ST-260; ST-CD-535).\nMuch of bebop's development happened during the 1942-1944 musicians' strike, when the American Federation of Musicians barred its more than 130,000 members from recording on major labels (singers were exempted). The strike had major effects, as some of the larger swing bands dispersed into smaller combos more suited to experimentation, and it meant bebop's evolution went largely unrecorded.\nThe first formal recordings of bebop were in 1944 under small specialty labels, which were less concerned than major labels with mass-market appeal. On February 16, 1944, Coleman Hawkins led a session including Dizzy Gillespie and Don Byas, with a rhythm section consisting of Clyde Hart (piano), Oscar Pettiford (bass) and Max Roach (drums) that recorded \"Woody'n You\" (Apollo 751), the first formal recording of bebop. Charlie Parker and Clyde Hart were recorded in a quintet led by guitarist Tiny Grimes for the Savoy label on September 15, 1944 (\"Tiny's Tempo, I'll Always Love You Just the Same, Romance Without Finance, Red Cross\"). Hawkins led another bebop-influenced recording session on October 19, 1944, this time with Thelonious Monk on piano, Edward Robinson on bass, and Denzil Best on drums (\"On the Bean, Recollections, Flyin' Hawk, Driftin' on a Reed\"; reissue, Prestige PRCD-24124-2).\nParker, Gillespie, and others working the bebop idiom joined the Earl Hines Orchestra in 1943, then followed vocalist Billy Eckstine out of the band into the Billy Eckstine Orchestra in 1944. The Eckstine band was recorded on V-discs, which were broadcast over the Armed Forces Radio Network and gained popularity for the band showcasing the new bebop style. The format of the Eckstine band, featuring vocalists and entertaining banter, would later be emulated by Gillespie and others leading bebop-oriented big bands in a style that might be termed \"popular bebop\". Starting with the Eckstine band's session for the De Luxe label on December 5, 1944 (\"If That's the Way You Feel, I Want to Talk About You, Blowing the Blues Away, Opus X, I'll Wait and Pray, The Real Thing Happened to Me\"), bebop recording sessions grew more frequent. Parker had left the band by that date, but it still included Gillespie along with Dexter Gordon and Gene Ammons on tenor, Leo Parker on baritone, Tommy Potter on bass, Art Blakey on drums, and Sarah Vaughan on vocals. \"Blowing the Blues Away\" featured a tenor saxophone duel between Gordon and Ammons.\nOn January 4, 1945, Clyde Hart led a session including Parker, Gillespie, and Don Byas recorded for the Continental label (\"What's the Matter Now, I Want Every Bit of It, That's the Blues, G.I. Blues, Dream of You, Seventh Avenue, Sorta Kinda, Ooh Ooh, My My, Ooh Ooh\"). Gillespie recorded his first session as a leader on January 9, 1945, for the Manor label, with Don Byas on tenor, Trummy Young on trombone, Clyde Hart on Piano, Oscar Pettiford on bass, and Irv Kluger on drums. The session recorded \"I Can't Get Started, Good Bait, Be-bop (Dizzy's Fingers)\", and \"Salt Peanuts\" (which Manor wrongly named \"Salted Peanuts\"). Thereafter, Gillespie would record bebop prolifically and gain recognition as one of its leading figures. Gillespie featured Gordon as a sideman in a session recorded on February 9, 1945 for the Guild label (\"Groovin' High, Blue 'n' Boogie\"). Parker appeared in Gillespie-led sessions dated February 28 (\"Groovin' High, All the Things You Are, Dizzy Atmosphere\") and May 11, 1945 (\"Salt Peanuts, Shaw 'Nuff, Lover Man, Hothouse\") for the Guild label. Parker and Gillespie were sidemen with Sarah Vaughan on May 25, 1945, for the Continental label (\"What More Can a Woman Do, I'd Rather Have a Memory Than a Dream, Mean to Me\"). Parker and Gillespie appeared in a session under vibraphonist Red Norvo dated June 6, 1945, later released under the Dial label (\"Hallelujah, Get Happy, Slam Slam Blues, Congo Blues\"). Sir Charles Thompson's all-star session of September 4, 1945 for the Apollo label (\"Takin' Off, If I Had You, Twentieth Century Blues, The Street Beat\") featured Parker and Gordon. Gordon led his first session for the Savoy label on October 30, 1945, with Sadik Hakim (Argonne Thornton) on piano, Gene Ramey on bass, and Eddie Nicholson on drums (\"Blow Mr Dexter, Dexter's Deck, Dexter's Cuttin' Out, Dexter's Minor Mad\"). Parker's first session as a leader was on November 26, 1945, for the Savoy label, with Miles Davis and Gillespie on trumpet, Hakim/Thornton and Gillespie on piano, Curley Russell on bass and Max Roach on drums (\"Warming Up a Riff, Now's the Time, Billie's Bounce, Thriving on a Riff, Ko-Ko, Meandering\"). After appearing as a sideman in the R&amp;B-oriented Cootie Williams Orchestra through 1944, Bud Powell was in bebop sessions led by Frankie Socolow on May 2, 1945 for the Duke label (\"The Man I Love, Reverse the Charges, Blue Fantasy, September in the Rain\"), then Dexter Gordon on January 29, 1946 for the Savoy label (\"Long Tall Dexter, Dexter Rides Again, I Can't Escape From You, Dexter Digs In\"). The growth of bebop through 1945 is also documented in informal live recordings.\nBreakout.\nBy 1946 bebop was established as a broad-based movement among New York jazz musicians, including trumpeters Fats Navarro and Kenny Dorham, trombonists J. J. Johnson and Kai Winding, alto saxophonist Sonny Stitt, tenor saxophonist James Moody, baritone saxophonists Leo Parker and Serge Chaloff, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, pianists Erroll Garner and Al Haig, bassist Slam Stewart, and others who would contribute to what would become known as \"modern jazz\". The new music was gaining radio exposure with broadcasts such as those hosted by \"Symphony Sid\" Torin. Bebop was taking root in Los Angeles as well, among such modernists as trumpeters Howard McGhee and Art Farmer, alto players Sonny Criss and Frank Morgan, tenor players Teddy Edwards and Lucky Thompson, trombonist Melba Liston, pianists Dodo Marmarosa, Jimmy Bunn and Hampton Hawes, guitarist Barney Kessel, bassists Charles Mingus and Red Callender, and drummers Roy Porter and Connie Kay. Gillespie's \"Rebop Six\" (with Parker on alto, Lucky Thompson on tenor, Al Haig on piano, Milt Jackson on vibes, Ray Brown on bass, and Stan Levey on drums) started an engagement in Los Angeles in December 1945. Parker and Thompson remained in Los Angeles after the rest of the band left, performing and recording together for six months before Parker suffered an addiction-related breakdown in July. Parker was again active in Los Angeles in early 1947. Parker and Thompson's tenures in Los Angeles, the arrival of Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray later in 1946, and the promotional efforts of Ross Russell, Norman Granz, and Gene Norman helped solidify the city's status as a center of the new music.\nGillespie landed the first recording date with a major label for the new music, with the RCA Bluebird label recording Dizzy Gillespie And his Orchestra on February 22, 1946 (\"52nd Street Theme, A Night in Tunisia, Ol' Man Rebop, Anthropology\"). Later Afro-Cuban styled recordings for Bluebird in collaboration with Cuban \"rumberos\" Chano Pozo and Sabu Martinez, and arrangers Gil Fuller and George Russell (\"Manteca, Cubana Be, Cubana Bop, Guarache Guaro\") would be among his most popular, giving rise to the Latin dance music craze of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Gillespie, with his extroverted personality and humor, glasses, lip beard and beret, would become the most visible symbol of the new music and new jazz culture in popular consciousness. That of course slighted the contributions of others with whom he had developed the music over the preceding years. His show style, influenced by black vaudeville circuit entertainers, seemed like a throwback to some and offended some purists (\"too much grinning\" according to Miles Davis), but it was laced with a subversive sense of humor that gave a glimpse of attitudes on racial matters that black musicians had previously kept away from the public at large. Before the Civil Rights Movement, Gillespie was confronting the racial divide by lampooning it. The intellectual subculture that surrounded bebop made it something of a sociological movement as well as a musical one.\nWith the imminent demise of the big swing bands, bebop had become the dynamic focus of the jazz world, with a broad-based \"progressive jazz\" movement seeking to emulate and adapt its devices. It was to be the most influential foundation of jazz for a generation of jazz musicians.\nBeyond.\nBy 1950, bebop musicians such as Clifford Brown and Sonny Stitt began to smooth out the rhythmic eccentricities of early bebop. Instead of using jagged phrasing to create rhythmic interest, as the early boppers had, these musicians constructed their improvised lines out of long strings of eighth notes and simply accented certain notes in the line to create rhythmic variety. The early 1950s also saw some smoothing in Charlie Parker's style.\nDuring the early 1950s bebop remained at the top of awareness of jazz, while its harmonic devices were adapted to the new \"cool\" school of jazz led by Miles Davis and others. It continued to attract young musicians such as Jackie McLean, Sonny Rollins, and John Coltrane. As musicians and composers began to work with expanded music theory during the mid-1950s, its adaptation by musicians who worked it into the basic dynamic approach of bebop would lead to the development of post-bop. Around that same time, a move towards structural simplification of bebop occurred among musicians such as Horace Silver and Art Blakey, leading to the movement known as hard bop. Development of jazz would occur through the interplay of bebop, cool, post-bop, and hard bop styles through the 1950s.\nInfluence.\nThe musical devices developed with bebop were influential far beyond the bebop movement itself. \"Progressive jazz\" was a broad category of music that included bebop-influenced \"art music\" arrangements used by big bands such as those led by Boyd Raeburn, Charlie Ventura, Claude Thornhill, and Stan Kenton, and the cerebral harmonic explorations of smaller groups such as those led by pianists Lennie Tristano and Dave Brubeck. Voicing experiments based on bebop harmonic devices were used by Miles Davis and Gil Evans for the groundbreaking \"Birth of the Cool\" sessions in 1949 and 1950. Musicians who followed the stylistic doors opened by Davis, Evans, Tristano, and Brubeck formed the core of the cool jazz and \"west coast jazz\" movements of the early 1950s.\nBy the mid-1950s musicians began to be influenced by music theory proposed by George Russell. Those who incorporated Russell's ideas into the bebop foundation defined the post-bop movement that later incorporated modal jazz into its musical language.\nHard bop was a simplified derivative of bebop introduced by Horace Silver and Art Blakey in the mid-1950s. It became a major influence until the late 1960s when free jazz and fusion jazz gained ascendancy.\nThe neo-bop movement of the 1980s and 1990s revived the influence of bebop, post-bop, and hard bop styles after the free jazz and fusion eras.\nBebop style also influenced the Beat Generation whose spoken-word style drew on African-American \"jive\" dialog, jazz rhythms, and whose poets often employed jazz musicians to accompany them. Jack Kerouac would describe his writing in On the Road as a literary translation of the improvisations of Charlie Parker and Lester Young. The \"beatnik\" stereotype borrowed heavily from the dress and mannerisms of bebop musicians and followers, in particular the beret and lip beard of Dizzy Gillespie and the patter and bongo drumming of guitarist Slim Gaillard. The bebop subculture, defined as a non-conformist group expressing its values through musical communion, would be echoed in the attitude of the psychedelia-era hippies of the 1960s. Fans of bebop were not restricted to the United States; the music also gained cult status in France and Japan.\nMore recently, hip-hop artists (A Tribe Called Quest, Guru) have cited bebop as an influence on their rapping and rhythmic style. As early as 1983, Shawn Brown rapped the phrase \"Rebop, bebop, Scooby-Doo\" toward the end of the hit \"Rappin' Duke\". Bassist Ron Carter collaborated with A Tribe Called Quest on 1991's \"The Low End Theory\", and vibraphonist Roy Ayers and trumpeter Donald Byrd were featured on \"Guru's Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1\" in 1993. Bebop samples, especially bass lines, ride cymbal swing clips, and horn and piano riffs are found throughout the hip-hop compendium.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
