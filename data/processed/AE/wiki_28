{"id": "47548", "revid": "50986636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47548", "title": "Daylight saving time", "text": "Seasonal change of clock settings\nDaylight saving time (DST), also referred to as daylight savings time, daylight time (United States and Canada), or summer time (United Kingdom, European Union, and others), is the practice of advancing clocks to make better use of the longer daylight available during summer so that darkness falls at a later clock time. The standard implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in spring or late winter, and to set clocks back by one hour to standard time in the autumn (or \"fall\" in North American English, hence the mnemonic: \"spring forward and fall back\").\nIn several countries, the number of weeks when DST is observed is much longer than the number devoted to standard time.\nOverview.\nAs of 2023, around 34 percent of the world's countries use DST, primarily in Europe and North America. Some countries observe it only in some regions. Canada largely observes DST, with the exceptions of Yukon, most of Saskatchewan, and parts of Nunavut, British Columbia and Quebec. It is observed by four Australian states and one territory. In the United States, it is observed by all states except Hawaii, Arizona (within the latter, however, the Navajo Nation does observe it), and the U.S. Territories.\nHistorically, several ancient societies adopted seasonal changes to their timekeeping to make better use of daylight; Roman timekeeping even included changes to water clocks to accommodate this. However, these were changes to the time divisions of the day rather than setting the whole clock forward. In a satirical letter to the editor of the \"Journal de Paris\" in 1784, Benjamin Franklin suggested that if Parisians could only wake up earlier in the summer they would economize on candle and oil usage, but he did not propose changing the clocks. In 1895, New Zealand entomologist and astronomer George Hudson made the first realistic proposal to change clocks by two hours every spring to the Wellington Philosophical Society, but this was not implemented until 1928 and in another form. In 1907, William Willett proposed the adoption of British Summer Time as a way to save energy; although seriously considered by Parliament, it was not implemented until 1916.\nThe first implementation of DST was by Port Arthur (today merged into Thunder Bay), in Ontario, Canada, in 1908, but only locally, not nationally. The first nation-wide implementations were by the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires, both starting on 30 April 1916. Since then, many countries have adopted DST at various times, particularly since the 1970s energy crisis.\nRationale.\nIndustrialized societies usually follow a clock-based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics, daylight lasts longer in that hemisphere's summer and is shorter in that hemisphere's winter, with the effect becoming greater the farther one moves away from the equator. DST is of little use for locations near the Equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight over the course of the year.\nAfter synchronously resetting the clocks in a region to one hour ahead of standard time in spring in anticipation of longer daylight hours, individuals following a clock-based schedule will be awakened an hour earlier in the solar day than they would have been otherwise. They will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier; in most cases, they will have an extra hour of daylight available to them after their workday activities.\nThe clock shift is partly motivated by practicality. At the summer solstice, in American temperate latitudes, for example, the sun rises around 04:30 standard time and sets around 19:30. Since most people are asleep at 04:30, it is seen as practical to treat 04:30 as if it were 05:30, thereby allowing people to wake closer to the sunrise and be active in the evening light, as the sun under DST sets an hour later (20:30).\nProponents of daylight saving time argue that most people prefer more daylight hours after the typical \"nine to five\" workday. Supporters have also argued that DST decreases energy consumption by reducing the need for lighting and heating, but the actual effect on overall energy use is heavily disputed. For evaluation, it is required to go beyond considering only energy demand for lighting and also consider the energy used for heating or cooling buildings.\nVariation within a time zone.\nThe effect of daylight saving time also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone. \nHistory.\nAncient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into 12 hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour became progressively longer during spring and shorter during autumn. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year; at Rome's latitude, the third hour from sunrise (\"hora tertia\") started at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. From the 14th century onward, equal-length civil hours supplanted unequal ones, so civil time no longer varied by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as monasteries of Mount Athos and in Jewish ceremonies.\nBenjamin Franklin published the proverb \"early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise\", and published a letter in the \"Journal de Paris\" when he was an American envoy to France (1776\u20131785) suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight. This 1784 satire proposed taxing window shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise. Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules. However, this changed as rail transport and communication networks required a standardization of clocks unknown in Franklin's day.\nIn 1810, the Spanish National Assembly Cortes of C\u00e1diz issued a regulation that moved certain meeting times forward by one hour from 1 May to 30 September in recognition of seasonal changes, but it did not change the clocks. It also acknowledged that private businesses were in the practice of changing their opening hours to suit daylight conditions, but they did so of their volition.\nNew Zealand entomologist George Hudson first proposed modern DST. His shift-work job gave him spare time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895, he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch; he followed up with an 1898 paper. Many publications credit the DST proposal to prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1907 during a pre-breakfast ride when he observed how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer day. Willett also was an avid golfer who disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to advance the clock during the summer, and he published the proposal two years later. Liberal Party member of parliament Robert Pearce took up the proposal, introducing the first Daylight Saving Bill to the British House of Commons on 12 February 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.\nPort Arthur, Ontario, Canada, was the first city in the world to enact DST, on 1 July 1908. This was followed by Orillia, Ontario, introduced by William Sword Frost while mayor from 1911 to 1912. The first states to adopt DST () nationally were those of the German Empire and its World War I ally Austria-Hungary commencing on 30 April 1916, as a way to conserve coal during wartime. Britain, most of its allies, and many European neutrals soon followed. Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year, and the United States adopted daylight saving in 1918. Most jurisdictions abandoned DST in the years after the war ended in 1918, with exceptions including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, and the United States. It became common during World War II (some countries adopted double summer time), and was standardized in the US by federal law in 1966, and widely adopted in Europe from the 1970s as a result of the 1970s energy crisis. Since then, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals.\nIt is a common myth in the United States that DST was first implemented for the benefit of farmers. In reality, farmers have been one of the strongest lobbying groups against DST since it was first implemented. The factors that influence farming schedules, such as morning dew and dairy cattle's readiness to be milked, are ultimately dictated by the sun, so the clock change introduces unnecessary challenges.\nDST was first implemented in the US with the Standard Time Act of 1918, a wartime measure for seven months during World War I in the interest of adding more daylight hours to conserve energy resources. Year-round DST, or \"War Time\", was implemented again during World War II. After the war, local jurisdictions were free to choose if and when to observe DST until the Uniform Time Act which standardized DST in 1966. Permanent daylight saving time was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in January of 1974, but there were complaints of children going to school in the dark and working people commuting and starting their work day in pitch darkness during the winter. By October 1974, President Gerald Ford signed a law repealing year round daylight savings time.\nProcedure.\nThe relevant authorities typically schedule clock changes to occur at (or soon after) midnight and on a weekend, in order to lessen disruption to weekday schedules. A one-hour change is usual, but twenty-minute and two-hour changes have been used in the past. Notable exceptions today include Lord Howe Island with a thirty-minute change, and Troll (research station) that shifts two hours directly between CEST and GMT since 2016.\nIn all countries that observe daylight saving time seasonally (i.e., during summer and not winter), the clock is advanced from standard time to daylight saving time in the spring, and it is turned back from daylight saving time to standard time in the autumn.\nFor a midnight change in spring, a digital display of local time would appear to jump from 23:59:59.9 to 01:00:00.0. For the same clock in autumn, the local time would appear to repeat the hour preceding midnight, i.e. it would jump from 23:59:59.9 to 23:00:00.0.\nIn most countries that observe seasonal daylight saving time, clocks revert in winter to standard time. An exception exists in Ireland, where its winter clock has the same offset () and legal name as that in Britain (Greenwich Mean Time)\u2014but while its summer clock also has the same offset as Britain's (), its legal name is confusingly called Irish \"Standard\" Time as opposed to British Summer Time.\nSince 2019, Morocco observes daylight saving time every month but Ramadan. During the holy month (the date of which is determined by the lunar calendar and thus moves annually with regard to the Gregorian calendar), the country's civil clocks observe Western European Time (UTC+00:00, which geographically overlaps most of the nation). At the close of that month, its clocks are turned forward to Western European Summer Time (UTC+01:00).\nThe time at which to change clocks differs across jurisdictions. Members of the European Union conduct a coordinated change, changing all zones at the same instant, at 01:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which means that it changes at 02:00 Central European Time (CET), equivalent to 03:00 Eastern European Time (EET). As a result, the time differences across European time zones remain constant. North America coordination of the clock change differs, in that each jurisdiction changes at each local clock's 02:00, which temporarily creates an imbalance with the next time zone (until it adjusts its clock, one hour later, at 2 am there). For example, Mountain Time is for one hour in the spring two hours ahead of Pacific Time instead of the usual one hour ahead, and instead of one hour in the autumn, briefly zero hours ahead of Pacific Time.\nThe dates on which clocks change vary with location and year; consequently, the time differences between regions also vary throughout the year. For example, Paris (which uses Central European Time) is usually six hours ahead of New York City (which uses North American Eastern Time), except for a few weeks in March and October/November when it is five hours ahead. Paris and Santiago are six hours apart during the northern summer, four hours during the southern summer, and five hours for a few weeks per year. Since 1996, European Summer Time has been observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observed DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. Moreover, the beginning and ending dates are roughly reversed between the northern and southern hemispheres because spring and autumn are displaced six months. For example, mainland Chile observes DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in April, with transitions at the local clock's . In some countries, clocks are governed by regional jurisdictions within the country such that some jurisdictions change and others do not; this is currently the case in Australia, Canada, and the United States.\nFrom year to year, the dates on which to change clock may also move for political or social reasons. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 formalized the United States' period of daylight saving time observation as lasting six months (it was previously declared locally); this period was extended to seven months in 1986, and then to eight months in 2005. The 2005 extension was motivated in part by lobbyists from the candy industry, seeking to increase profits by including Halloween (31 October) within the daylight saving time period. In recent history, Australian state jurisdictions not only changed at different local times but sometimes on different dates. For example, in 2008 most states there that observed daylight saving time changed clocks forward on 5 October, but Western Australia changed on 26 October.\nPolitics, religion and sports.\nThe concept of daylight saving has caused controversy since its early proposals. Winston Churchill argued that it enlarges \"the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country\" and pundits have dubbed it \"Daylight Slaving Time\". Retailing, sports, and tourism interests have historically favored daylight saving, while agricultural and evening-entertainment interests (and some religious groups) have opposed it; energy crises and war prompted its initial adoption.\nWillett's 1907 proposal illustrates several political issues. It attracted many supporters, including Arthur Balfour, Churchill, David Lloyd George, Ramsay MacDonald, King Edward VII (who used half-hour DST or \"Sandringham time\" at Sandringham), the managing director of Harrods, and the manager of the National Bank Ltd. However, the opposition proved stronger, including Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, William Christie (the Astronomer Royal), George Darwin, Napier Shaw (director of the Meteorological Office), many agricultural organizations, and theatre-owners. After many hearings, a parliamentary committee vote narrowly rejected the proposal in 1909. Willett's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914, to no avail. People in the US demonstrated even more skepticism; Andrew Peters introduced a DST bill to the House of Representatives in May 1909, but it soon died in committee.\nGermany and its allies led the way in introducing DST during World War I on 30 April 1916, aiming to alleviate hardships due to wartime coal shortages and air-raid blackouts. The political equation changed in other countries; the United Kingdom used DST first on 21 May 1916. US retailing and manufacturing interests\u2014led by Pittsburgh industrialist Robert Garland\u2014soon began lobbying for DST, but railroads opposed the idea. The US' 1917 entry into the war overcame objections, and DST started in 1918.\nThe end of World War I brought a change in DST use. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it\u2014like Germany itself, which dropped DST from 1919 to 1939 and from 1950 to 1979. Britain proved an exception; it retained DST nationwide but adjusted transition dates over the years for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. As of 2009[ [update]], summer time began annually on the last Sunday in March under a European Community directive, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016). In the US, Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson\u2014an avid golfer like Willett\u2014vetoed the repeal twice, but his second veto was overridden. Only a few US cities retained DST locally, including New York (so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London), and Chicago and Cleveland (to keep pace with New York). Wilson's successor as president, Warren G. Harding, opposed DST as a \"deception\", reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer. He ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 8 am rather than 9 am during the summer of 1922. Some businesses followed suit, though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.\nSince Germany's adoption of DST in 1916, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals of DST, with similar politics involved. The history of time in the United States features DST during both world wars, but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966. St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, kept different clocks for two weeks in May 1965: the capital city decided to switch to daylight saving time, while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law. In the mid-1980s, Clorox and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to US DST. Both senators from Idaho, Larry Craig and Mike Crapo, voted for it based on the premise that fast-food restaurants sell more French fries (made from Idaho potatoes) during DST.\nA referendum on the introduction of daylight saving took place in Queensland, Australia, in 1992, after a three-year trial of daylight saving. It was defeated with a 54.5% \"no\" vote, with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, and those in the metropolitan southeast in favor.\nIn 2003, the United Kingdom's Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents supported a proposal to observe year-round daylight saving time, but it has been opposed by some industries, by some postal workers and farmers, and particularly by those living in the northern regions of the UK.\nIn 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to US DST.\nIn December 2008, the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating the implementation of a dual-time-zone arrangement for daylight saving in South East Queensland, while the rest of the state maintained standard time. DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested. After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed. Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington introduced the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into the Queensland parliament on 14 April 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time-zone arrangement. The Queensland parliament rejected Wellington's bill on 15 June 2011.\nRussia declared in 2011 that it would stay in DST all year long () and Belarus followed with a similar declaration. (The Soviet Union had operated under permanent \"summer time\" from 1930 to at least 1982.) Russia's plan generated widespread complaints due to the dark of winter-time mornings, and thus was abandoned in 2014. The country changed its clocks to standard time () on 26 October 2014, intending to stay there permanently.\nIn the United States, Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation), Hawaii, and the five populated territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands) do not participate in daylight saving time. Indiana only began participating in daylight saving time as recently as 2006. Between 2018 and 2024, former Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio repeatedly filed bills to extend daylight saving time permanently into winter, without success.\nMexico observed summertime daylight saving time starting in 1996. In late 2022, the nation's clocks \"fell back\" for the last time, in restoration of permanent standard time.\nReligion.\nSome religious groups and individuals have opposed DST on religious grounds. For religious Muslims and Jews it makes religious practices such as prayer and fasting more difficult or inconvenient.\nSome Muslim countries, such as Morocco, have temporarily abandoned DST during Ramadan.\nIn Israel, DST has been a point of contention between the religious and secular, resulting in fluctuations over the years, and a shorter DST period than in the EU and US. Religious Jews prefer a shorter DST due to DST delaying scheduled morning prayers, thus conflicting with standard working and business hours. Additionally, DST is ended before Yom Kippur (a 25-hour fast day starting and ending at sunset, much of which is spent praying in synagogue until the fast ends at sunset) since DST would result in the day ending later, which many feel makes it more difficult.\nIn the US, Orthodox Jewish groups have opposed extensions to DST, as well as a 2022 bipartisan bill that would make DST permanent, saying it will \"interfere with the ability of members of our community to engage in congregational prayers and get to their places of work on time.\"\nEffects.\nEffects on electricity consumption.\nProponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or is good for business. Opponents argue the actual energy savings are inconclusive.\nAlthough energy conservation goals still remain under certain conditions, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then. In a publication from 2025, based on this change in consumption patterns, such as air conditioning systems, additional consumption is expected to occur more frequently during daylight saving time in the future. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, so the results of a study conducted in one place may not be relevant to another country or climate. Nevertheless, while overall electricity usage does not decrease, the evening peak demand is flattened, which in turn has a direct impact on generation costs.\nA 2017 meta-analysis of 44 studies found that DST leads to electricity savings of 0.3% during the days when DST applies. Several studies have suggested that DST increases motor fuel consumption, but a 2008 United States Department of Energy report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the 2007 United States extension of DST. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity.\nEconomic effects.\nIt has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency and that in 2000, the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31 billion on US stock exchanges. Others have asserted that the observed results depend on methodology and disputed the findings, though the original authors have refuted points raised by disputers.\nEffects on health.\nThere are measurable adverse effects of clock-shifts on human health. It has been shown to disrupt human circadian rhythms, negatively affecting human health in the process, and that the yearly DST clock-shifts can increase health risks such as heart attacks and traffic accidents.\nA 2017 study in the \"American Economic Journal: Applied Economics\" estimated that \"the transition into DST caused over 30 deaths at a social cost of $275 million annually\", primarily by increasing sleep deprivation.\nAn LSE study found that DST transition increases people's feeling of being rushed for time, and the number of hours spent on leisure decreases by roughly 10 minutes following the transition and more specifically the spring transition into DST decreases life satisfaction by around 1.44 per cent. They show that respondents are running on less sleep that first day, and their individual productivity is affected as a result.\nA correlation between clock shifts and increase in traffic collisions has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. Four reports have found that this effect is smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. According to data shared by Titan Casket, hospitals see a 24% increase in heart attacks and a 6% increase in fatal crashes each year when the time changes. In 2018, the European Parliament, reviewing a possible abolition of DST, approved a more in-depth evaluation examining the disruption of the human body's circadian rhythms which provided evidence suggesting the existence of an association between DST clock-shifts and a modest increase of occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, especially in the first week after the spring shift. However a Netherlands study found, against the majority of investigations, contrary or minimal effect. Year-round standard time (not year-round DST) is proposed by some to be the preferred option for public health and safety. Clock shifts were found to increase the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks.\nIn 2025, a Stanford study compared the year-long circadian health impact of permanent Standard Time, permanent Daylight Saving Time, and biannually switching in the continental U.S. using models of the human circadian rhythm and health data from the CDC Places dataset. Researchers found that switching to permanent Standard Time was predicted to reduce cases of obesity by 2.6 million cases and stroke by 300,000 cases. Permanent Daylight Saving Time also reduced cases but to a lesser extent. In interviews, the authors caution that this work is from a circadian health perspective and that other factors should be considered in policy decisions such as economic and safety impacts of time policy.\nEffects on social relations.\nDST hurts prime-time television broadcast ratings, drive-ins and other theaters. Artificial outdoor lighting has a marginal and sometimes even contradictory influence on crime and fear of crime.\nLater sunsets from DST are thought to affect behavior; for example, increasing participation in after-school sports programs or outdoor afternoon sports such as golf, and attendance at professional sporting events. Advocates of daylight saving time argue that having more hours of daylight between the end of a typical workday and evening induces people to consume other goods and services.\nIn 2022, a publication of three replicating studies of individuals, between individuals, and transecting societies, demonstrated that sleep loss affects the human motivation to help others, which in its fMRI findings is \"associated with deactivation of key nodes within the social cognition brain network that facilitates prosociality.\" Furthermore, they detected, through analysis of over three million real-world charitable donations, that the loss of sleep inflicted by the transition to daylight saving time reduces altruistic giving compared to controls (being states not implementing DST). They conclude that the effects on civil society are \"non-trivial\".\nAnother study, which also examined sleep manipulation due to the shift to daylight saving time in the spring, analyzed archival data from judicial punishment imposed by US federal courts which showed sleep-deprived judges exact more severe penalties.\nInconvenience.\nDST's clock shifts have the disadvantage of complexity. People must remember to change their clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock shows local times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.\nMany farmers oppose DST, particularly dairy farmers as the milking patterns of their cows do not change with the time, and others whose hours are set by the sun. There is concern for schoolchildren who are out in the darkness during the morning due to late sunrises.\nRemediation.\nSome clock-shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously or at least more gradually\u2014for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions\u2014but this would add complexity and has never been implemented. DST inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of standard time. For example, when reading a sundial, one must compensate for it along with time zone and natural discrepancies. Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect.\nTerminology.\nAs explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form \"daylight savings time\" (with an \"s\") was already much more common than the older form \"daylight saving time\" in American English (\"the change has been virtually accomplished\") in 1978. Nevertheless, dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which typically describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first. This is because the older form is still very common in print and is preferred by many editors. (\"Although \"daylight saving time\" is considered correct, \"daylight savings time\" (with an \"s\") is commonly used.\") The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (\"daylight-saving(s) time\"). Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms daylight saving, daylight savings (both without \"time\"), and daylight time. The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style explains the development and current situation as follows:Although the singular form \"daylight saving time\" is the original one, dating from the early 20th century\u2014and is preferred by some usage critics\u2014the plural form is now extremely common in AmE. [...] The rise of \"daylight savings time\" appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when \"saving\" is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether \"saving\" is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving). [...] Using \"savings\" as the adjective\u2014as in \"savings account\" or \"savings bond\"\u2014makes perfect sense. More than that, it ought to be accepted as the better form.In Britain, Willett's 1907 proposal used the term \"daylight saving\", but by 1911, the term \"summer time\" replaced \"daylight saving time\" in draft legislation. The same or similar expressions are used in many other languages: \"Sommerzeit\" in German, \"zomertijd\" in Dutch, \"kes\u00e4aika\" in Finnish, \"horario de verano\" or \"hora de verano\" in Spanish, and \"heure d'\u00e9t\u00e9\" in French.\nThe name of local time typically changes when DST is observed. American English replaces \"standard\" with \"daylight\": for example, \"Pacific Standard Time\" (\"PST\") becomes \"Pacific Daylight Time\" (\"PDT\"). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is \"British Summer Time\" (BST), and British English typically inserts \"summer\" into other time zone names, e.g. \"Central European Time\" (\"CET\") becomes \"Central European Summer Time\" (\"CEST\").\nIn North American English, people use the mnemonic \"spring forward, fall back\" (also \"spring ahead\u00a0...\", \"spring up\u00a0...\", and \"...\u00a0fall behind\") to remember the direction in which to shift the clocks.\nComputing.\nChanges to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations. For example, the 2007 change to DST rules in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded, with the greatest onus on e-mail and calendar programs. The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate information technologists.\nSome applications standardize on UTC to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences. Likewise, most modern operating systems internally handle and store all times as UTC and only convert to local time for display. However, even if UTC is used internally, the systems still require external leap second updates and time zone information to correctly calculate local time as needed. Many systems in use today base their date/time calculations from data derived from the tz\u00a0database also known as zoneinfo.\nIANA time zone database.\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) tz\u00a0database maps a name to the named location's historical and predicted clock shifts. This database is used by many computer software systems, including most Unix-like operating systems, Java, and the Oracle RDBMS; HP's \"tztab\" database is similar but incompatible. When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance. In Unix-like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name, as in codice_1. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the codice_2 file, which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in time-zone-independent Unix time; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.\nOlder or stripped-down systems may support only the TZ values required by POSIX, which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value. For example, codice_3 specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007. Such a TZ value must be changed whenever DST rules change, and the new value applies to all years, mishandling some older timestamps.\nOpposition to clock changes.\nOpposition to changing the clocks twice a year broadly takes three forms:\nA move to permanent daylight saving time (staying on summer hours all year with no clock shifts) is sometimes advocated and is currently implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina, Belarus, Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Namibia, Northern Cyprus, Paraguay, Saskatchewan, Syria, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the Yukon. Although Saskatchewan follows Central Standard Time, its capital city Regina experiences solar noon close to 13:00, in effect putting the city on permanent daylight time. Similarly, Yukon is classified as being in the Mountain Time Zone, though in effect it observes permanent Pacific Daylight Time to align with the Pacific time zone in summer, but local solar noon in the capital Whitehorse occurs nearer to 14:00, in effect putting Whitehorse on \"double daylight time\".\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland put clocks forward by an extra hour during World War II and experimented with year-round summer time between 1968 and 1971. Russia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014, but the move proved unpopular because of the extremely late winter sunrises; in 2014, Russia switched permanently back to standard time. However, the change to permanent DST has proven popular in Turkey, with the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources saying the practice saves \"millions in energy costs and reduces depression and anxiety levels associated with short exposure to daylight\".\nIn September 2018, the European Commission proposed to end seasonal clock changes as of 2019. Member states would have the option of observing either daylight saving time all year round or standard time all year round. In March 2019, the European Parliament approved the commission's proposal, while deferring implementation from 2019 until 2021. In response to this proposition, the European Sleep Research Society stated \"installing permanent Central European Time (CET, standard time or 'wintertime') is the best option for public health.\" As of October\u00a02020[ [update]], the decision has not been confirmed[] by the Council of the European Union. The council has asked the commission to produce a detailed assessment of its effects, but the Commission considers that the onus is on the Member States to find a common position in Council. As a result, progress on the issue is effectively blocked.\nIn the United States, several states have enacted legislation to implement permanent DST, but the bills would require Congress to change federal law in order to take effect. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 permits states to opt out of DST and observe permanent standard time, but it does not permit permanent DST. Florida senator Marco Rubio in particular has promoted changing the federal law to implement permanent DST, with the support of the Florida Chamber of Commerce seeking to boost evening revenue. In 2022, Rubio's \"Sunshine Protection Act\" passed the United States Senate without committee review by way of voice consent, with many senators afterward stating they were unaware of the vote or its topic. The bill was stopped in the US House, where questions were raised as to whether permanent DST or standard time would be more beneficial. Polling as of 2025 shows a majority of Americans polled now prefer to permanently end DST, with 54% of Americans reporting that a permanent switch to standard time would be preferable. The emergent majority indicates that permanent DST would also be preferred over no change, with the least popular activity being the changing of the time twice per year regardless of DST or standard time being the permanent method of keeping time.\nAdvocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice-yearly clock shifts. Additional benefits have also been cited, including safer roadways, boosting the tourism industry, and energy savings. Detractors cite the relatively late sunrises, particularly in winter, that year-round DST entails.\nSome experts in circadian rhythms and sleep health recommend year-round standard time as the preferred option for public health and safety. However, some experts state that permanent daylight saving time is still a better option when compared to annual clock changes. Several chronobiology societies have published position papers against adopting DST permanently. A paper by the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms states: \"based on comparisons of large populations living in DST or ST or on western versus eastern edges of time zones, the advantages of permanent ST outweigh switching to DST annually or permanently.\" The World Federation of Societies for Chronobiology recommended \"reassigning countries and regions to their actual sun-clock based time zones\" and held the position of being \"against the switching between DST and Standard Time and even more so against adopting DST permanently.\" The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) holds the position that \"seasonal time changes should be abolished in favor of a fixed, national, year-round standard time,\" and that \"standard time is a better option than daylight saving time for our health, mood and well-being.\" Their position was endorsed by 20 other organizations, including the American College of Chest Physicians, National Safety Council, and National PTA.\nSurveys reported between 2021 and 2022 by the National Sleep Foundation, YouGov, CBS, and Monmouth University indicate more Americans would prefer permanent DST. A 2019 survey by the National Opinion Research Center and a 2021 survey by the Associated Press indicate more Americans would prefer permanent Standard Time. The National Sleep Foundation, YouGov, and Monmouth University polls leaned significantly in favor of seeing daylight saving time made permanent. The Monmouth University poll reported 44% preferring year-round DST and 13% preferring year-round standard time. The NORC at the University of Chicago found 79% of those interviewed to be in favor of permanent DST during the Oil Crisis in December 1973; 42% of poll takers supported it the following February.\nAs of 2025, polls indicate a slight majority of those polled in the United States favor abolishing DST, with momentum gaining in all areas where the practice persists either to abolish DST and switch permanently to standard time, or to make DST permanent. Common arguments for abolishing or making DST permanent include health risks, economic costs, lost sleep, and disruptions to daily routines.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were the last recorded words of passenger Todd Beamer on board United Airlines Flight 93 during the September 11 attacks in 2001, before he and other passengers attempted to storm the cockpit and retake the plane from the hijackers. The slogan subsequently became a battle cry for American forces during the war on terror.\nOrigins.\nIn the American west, many wagon trains began their journeys with the shout \"Wagons roll!\" from the head of the train. A less formal terminology would soon develop from the historic precedent. The phrase, \"let's roll\" has been used as early as 1908 in the cadence song now called \"The Army Goes Rolling Along\", which likely extended into tank usage. \n\"The Roads Must Roll\", a science fiction story written in 1940 by Robert A. Heinlein, mentions a re-worded version of \"The Roll of the Caissons\" called \"Road Songs of the Transport Cadets\". The protagonist of the 1937 supernatural comedy, \"Topper\", played by Cary Grant, uses the phrase \"Let's roll\" to his wife, played by Constance Bennett, to indicate they should immediately exit their friend's stuffy office and find a drink. The protagonist of Ernest Hemingway's 1950 novel \"Across the River and into the Trees\", Colonel Dick Cantwell, based on World War II commander Charles \"Buck\" Lanham, uses the phrase to his driver. The verb \"roll\" has been used in both the film and recording industry to signal the beginning of a film or audio recording.\nSeptember 11 attacks.\nOn September 11, 2001, Todd Beamer, a passenger on the hijacked United Airlines Flight 93, tried to place a call through an air phone, but he was routed to a customer service representative instead, who passed him on to supervisor Lisa Jefferson. Beamer reported that one passenger had been killed and that a flight attendant had told him that both the pilot and co-pilot had been forced from the cockpit and may have been injured. He was also on the phone when the plane made a quick and violent turn. Later, he told the operator that some of the other passengers were planning to attack the hijackers and regain control of the aircraft, after they learned about what happened at the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. According to Jefferson, Beamer's last audible words were \"Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll.\"\nIn a November 8, 2001 address from the World Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia, President George W. Bush invoked Beamer's words: \"Some of our greatest moments have been acts of courage for which no one could have been prepared. But we have our marching orders. My fellow Americans, let's roll!\" He used them again in the 2002 State of the Union address: \"For too long our culture has said, 'If it feels good, do it.' Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: 'Let's roll.'\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Categorized as formulaic language, an idiomatic expression's meaning is different from the literal meanings of each word inside it. \nIdioms occur frequently in all languages. In English alone there are an estimated twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions. Some well known idioms in English are \"spill the beans\" (meaning \"reveal secret information\"), \"it's raining cats and dogs\" (meaning \"it's raining intensely\"), and \"break a leg\" (meaning \"good luck\").\nDerivations.\nMany idiomatic expressions were meant literally in their original use, but occasionally the attribution of the literal meaning changed and the phrase itself grew away from its original roots\u2014typically leading to a folk etymology. For instance, the phrase \"spill the beans\" (meaning to reveal a secret) is first attested in 1919, but has been said to originate from an ancient method of voting by depositing beans in jars, which could be spilled, prematurely revealing the results.\nOther idioms are deliberately figurative. For example, \"break a leg\" is an expression commonly said to wish a person good luck just prior to their giving a performance or presentation, which apparently wishes injury on them.\nCompositionality.\nIn linguistics, idioms are usually presumed to be figures of speech contradicting the principle of compositionality. That compositionality is the key notion for the analysis of idioms is emphasized in most accounts of idioms. This principle states that the meaning of a whole should be constructed from the meanings of the parts that make up the whole. In other words, one should be in a position to understand the whole if one understands the meanings of each of the parts that make up the whole.\nFor example, if the phrase \"Fred \"kicked the bucket\"\" is understood compositionally, it means that Fred has literally kicked an actual, physical bucket. The idiomatic reading, however, is non-compositional: it means that Fred has died. Arriving at the idiomatic reading from the literal reading is unlikely for most speakers. What this means is that the idiomatic reading is, rather, stored as a single lexical item that is now largely independent of the literal reading.\nIn phraseology, idioms are defined as a sub-type of , the meaning of which is not the regular sum of the meanings of its component parts. John Saeed defines an idiom as collocated words that became affixed to each other until metamorphosing into a fossilised term. This collocation of words redefines each component word in the word-group and becomes an \"idiomatic expression\". Idioms usually do not translate well; in some cases, when an idiom is translated directly word-for-word into another language, either its meaning is changed or it is meaningless.\nWhen two or three words are conventionally used together in a particular sequence, they form an irreversible binomial. For example, a person may be \"left high and dry\", but never \"left dry and high\". Not all irreversible binomials are idioms, however: \"chips and dip\" is irreversible, but its meaning is straightforwardly derived from its components.\nMobility.\nIdioms possess varying degrees of mobility. Whereas some idioms are used only in a routine form, others can undergo syntactic modifications such as passivization, raising constructions, and clefting, demonstrating separable constituencies within the idiom. \"Mobile idioms\", allowing such movement, maintain their idiomatic meaning where \"fixed idioms\" do not:\nMany fixed idioms lack \"semantic composition\", meaning that the idiom contains the semantic role of a verb, but not of any object. This is true of \"kick the bucket\", which means \"die\". By contrast, the semantically composite idiom \"spill the beans\", meaning \"reveal a secret\", contains both a semantic verb and object, \"reveal\" and \"secret\". Semantically composite idioms have a syntactic similarity between their surface and semantic forms.\nThe types of movement allowed for certain idioms also relate to the degree to which the literal reading of the idiom has a connection to its idiomatic meaning. This is referred to as \"motivation\" or \"transparency\". While most idioms that do not display semantic composition generally do not allow non-adjectival modification, those that are also motivated allow lexical substitution. For example, \"oil the wheels\" and \"grease the wheels\" allow variation for nouns that elicit a similar literal meaning. These types of changes can occur only when speakers can easily recognize a connection between what the idiom is meant to express and its literal meaning, thus an idiom like \"kick the bucket\" cannot occur as \"kick the pot\".\nFrom the perspective of dependency grammar, idioms are represented as a catena which cannot be interrupted by non-idiomatic content. Although syntactic modifications introduce disruptions to the idiomatic structure, this continuity is only required for idioms as lexical entries.\nCertain idioms, allowing unrestricted syntactic modification, can be said to be metaphors. Expressions such as \"jump on the bandwagon\", \"pull strings\", and \"draw the line\" all represent their meaning independently in their verbs and objects, making them compositional. In the idiom \"jump on the bandwagon\", \"jump on\" involves joining something and a 'bandwagon' can refer to a collective cause, regardless of context.\nTranslation.\nA word-by-word translation of an opaque idiom will most likely not convey the same meaning in other languages. The English idiom \"kick the bucket\" has a variety of equivalents in other languages, such as \"kopn\u0105\u0107 w kalendarz\" (\"kick the calendar\") in Polish, \"casser sa pipe\" (\"to break one\u2019s pipe\") in French and \"tirare le cuoia\" (\"pulling the leathers\") in Italian.\nSome idioms are transparent. Much of their meaning gets through if they are taken (or translated) literally. For example, \"lay one's cards on the table\" meaning to reveal previously unknown intentions or to reveal a secret. Transparency is a matter of degree; \"spill the beans\" (to let secret information become known) and \"leave no stone unturned\" (to do everything possible in order to achieve or find something) are not entirely literally interpretable but involve only a slight metaphorical broadening. Another category of idioms is a word having several meanings, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes discerned from the context of its usage. This is seen in the (mostly uninflected) English language in polysemes, the common use of the same word for an activity, for those engaged in it, for the product used, for the place or time of an activity, and sometimes for a verb.\nIdioms tend to confuse those unfamiliar with them; students of a new language must learn its idiomatic expressions as vocabulary. Many natural language words have \"idiomatic origins\" but are assimilated and so lose their figurative senses. For example, in Portuguese, the expression \"saber de cora\u00e7\u00e3o\" 'to know by heart', with the same meaning as in English, was shortened to 'saber de cor', and, later, to the verb \"decorar\", meaning \"memorize\".\nIn 2015, TED collected 40 examples of bizarre idioms that cannot be translated literally. They include the Swedish saying \"to slide in on a shrimp sandwich\", which refers those who did not have to work to get where they are.\nConversely, idioms may be shared between multiple languages. For example, the Arabic phrase \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0643\u0628 (\"fi nafs al-markeb\") is translated as \"in the same boat\", and it carries the same figurative meaning as the equivalent idiom in English. Another example would be the Japanese yojijukugo \u4e00\u77f3\u4e8c\u9ce5 (\"isseki ni ch\u014d\"), which is translated as \"one stone, two birds\". This is analogous to \"to kill two birds with one stone\" in English.\nAccording to the German linguist Elizabeth Piirainen, the idiom \"to get on one's nerves\" has the same figurative meaning in 57 European languages. She also says that the phrase \"to shed crocodile tears\", meaning to express insincere sorrow, is similarly widespread in European languages but is also used in Arabic, Swahili, Persian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Mongolian, and several others.\nThe origin of cross-language idioms is uncertain. One theory is that cross-language idioms are a language contact phenomenon, resulting from a word-for-word translation called a calque. Piirainen says that may happen as a result of lingua franca usage in which speakers incorporate expressions from their own native tongue, which exposes them to speakers of other languages. Other theories suggest they come from a shared ancestor-language or that humans are naturally predisposed to develop certain metaphors.\nNon-compositionality.\nThe non-compositionality of meaning of idioms challenges theories of syntax. The fixed words of many idioms do not qualify as constituents in any sense. For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;How do we get to the bottom of this situation?\nThe fixed words of this idiom (in bold) do not form a constituent in any theory's analysis of syntactic structure because the object of the preposition (here \"this situation\") is not part of the idiom (but rather it is an argument of the idiom). One can know that it is not part of the idiom because it is variable; for example, \"How do we get to the bottom of this situation / the claim / the phenomenon / her statement /\" etc. What this means is that theories of syntax that take the constituent to be the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis are challenged. The manner in which units of meaning are assigned to units of syntax remains unclear. This problem has motivated a tremendous amount of discussion and debate in linguistics circles and it is a primary motivator behind the Construction Grammar framework.\nA relatively recent development in the syntactic analysis of idioms departs from a constituent-based account of syntactic structure, preferring instead the catena-based account. The catena unit was introduced to linguistics by William O'Grady in 1998. Any word or any combination of words that are linked together by dependencies qualifies as a catena. The words constituting idioms are stored as catenae in the lexicon, and as such, they are concrete units of syntax. The dependency grammar trees of a few sentences containing non-constituent idioms illustrate the point:\nThe fixed words of the idiom (in orange) in each case are linked together by dependencies; they form a catena. The material that is outside of the idiom (in normal black script) is not part of the idiom. The following two trees illustrate proverbs:\nThe fixed words of the proverbs (in orange) again form a catena each time. The adjective \"nitty-gritty\" and the adverb \"always\" are not part of the respective proverb and their appearance does not interrupt the fixed words of the proverb. A caveat concerning the catena-based analysis of idioms concerns their status in the lexicon. Idioms are lexical items, which means they are stored as catenae in the lexicon. In the actual syntax, however, some idioms can be broken up by various functional constructions.\nThe catena-based analysis of idioms provides a basis for an understanding of meaning compositionality. The Principle of Compositionality can in fact be maintained. Units of meaning are being assigned to catenae, whereby many of these catenae are not constituents.\nVarious studies have investigated methods to develop the ability to interpret idioms in children with various diagnoses including autism, moderate learning difficulties, developmental language disorder and typically developing weak readers.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

This species is found in Europe where it frequents both slow and moderate rivers, as well as canals, lakes and still waterbodies of various kinds.\nDescription.\nIt is a stocky fish with a large rounded head. Its body is long and cylindrical in shape and is covered in large greenish-brown scales which are edged with narrow bands of black across the back, paling to golden on the flanks and even paler on the belly. The tail is dark brown or black, the dorsal fin is a greyish-green in colour and all the other fins are orange-red. The dorsal fin has 3 spines and 7\u20139 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7\u201310 rays. The vertebrae count is 42\u201348. It can grow to 60\u00a0cm standard length but most fish are around 30\u00a0cm.\nEggs are round with a 1.8 mm diameter, and first day larvae are 6 - 7\u00a0mm long and weight about 120 mg.\nDistribution.\nThe chub is distributed throughout most of northern Eurasia, it can be found in the rivers flowing into the North, Baltic, northern Black, White, Barents and Caspian Sea basins, the Atlantic basins south to Adour drainage in France and in Great Britain north to 56\u00b0, in Scandinavia in southern Finland and southern Sweden north to around Stockholm. In the Mediterranean basin it is found in France from the Var to the H\u00e9rault, and may also be present in the Aude, drainages. It is absent as a native species from Ireland and Italy but has been introduced to both countries; in Italy \"S. cephalus\" is present and acclimatised since decades, but it seems marginally found here and there (mainly in the Po river basin), never forming well established populations.\nHabitat and ecology.\nIt is most abundant in small rivers and large streams in the \"barbel zone\" where there are riffles and pools. It occurs along the banks of slow-flowing lowland rivers in large lake and even in mountain streams. Chub in lakes undertake spawning migrations into inflowing streams. The adult fish are solitary but the juvenile fish are sociable and occur in shoals. The larvae and juveniles prefer rather shallow habitats along shorelines and these smaller fish have a varied diet of aquatic and terrestrial animals while the large, solitary adults prey mainly on freshwater shrimp and small fishes. In the United Kingdom, chub have been recorded feeding on worms, molluscs, crustaceans, and various insect larvae while large chub eat considerable numbers of small fish, such as chub, eels, common dace, common roach, gudgeon and minnows as well as frogs, crayfish, voles and young water birds. They have also been observed eating berries such as blackberries and elderberry from trees overhanging the water. They feed throughout the year if there are opportunities, even in the coldest days of midwinter.\nSpawning happens when the water temperature reaches 14\u00a0\u00b0C, and lasts from May to September. They spawn in fast-flowing water above gravel substrates but only infrequently will they spawn among submerged vegetation. The females spawn more than once during a season and each female will mate with several males. The males aggregate at spawning sites and will follow the ripe females, often with much splashing, to shallow riffles. Females lay pale yellow sticky eggs which adhere to the gravel, weed and stones in flowing water. Sexual maturity in chub is influenced by environmental factors with males reaching sexual maturity at the age of 2\u20134 years while females reach it at 4\u20136 although some individuals may mature much later than this. The fish can live for up to 22 years in the wild, where the age of fish can be assessed through by the number of rings that are visible in scales, these represent seasonal growth patterns.\nThreats.\nRecent work has shown that chub ingest microplastic particles. Whereas many as 25% of sampled fish contained particles, these particles were not found in muscles. Many of the particles found were fibres that are released from clothes during washing, these are also ingested by macroinvertebrates such as \"Daphnia\"\".\" Chub can also be contaminated by metal pollution such as copper, magnesium and sodium which can accumulate in tissues like the muscle, gills and liver. Young of the year fish contained particularly high levels of metal contaminants.\nFishing for chub.\nThey are popular with anglers due to their readiness to feed, and thus to be caught, in almost any conditions. Small chub are freely biting fish which even inexperienced anglers find easy to catch. As they become larger, however, chub become more wary and are easily spooked by noise or visual disturbance. Consequently, large chub (in excess of 2\u00a0kg) are keenly sought by anglers who prefer to target specific fish.\nThe British angling record for chub was broken on 16 March 2012 when Neil Steven caught a fish from the River Lea in Essex, though there are several over 10\u00a0lb on the Angling Trust's Top 50 list, which have been deprecated for various reasons. The European record is . The chub can reach a maximum length of 64\u201382\u00a0cm (24\u201331.5\u00a0in).\nTackle and tactics.\nSmaller chub are not too difficult to catch and on small or medium-sized rivers, a stick-float fishing approach can be adopted or even a swim-feeder and using almost any bait including maggots, luncheon meat, sweetcorn and even small lures and flies. Chub also eat marine derived fishmeal-based pellets and diets of wild chub diets contain 44% of these pellets. Catching the larger specimens however requires a patient and stealthy approach as most larger chub are caught on the smaller, clearer rivers and as a result, the angler must make their presence as subtle as possible and yet again, not a lot of tackle is required and most anglers may even set their tackle up before they get their favored spot as there is less noise from tackle being set up that may disturb the fish. A classic chub spot is just hanging off (or even inside) branches/bushes brushing through the water as chub are quite sensitive to sunlight and most anglers may fish at sunrise or sunset when the chub leave their entangled home. An angler should also look for where the current is being pushed out, causing a re-circulation pattern behind what ever is pushing the current outwards and this is where much food will wash around and where there will probably be feeding fish. Like with the smaller chub, a range of baits can be used but smaller baits such as maggots may attract small fish like minnows (especially on smaller rivers) so a larger bait such as luncheon meat is best used. In terms of the line setup, line ratings of a range of 4\u20138 pounds breaking-strain is ideal, less experienced anglers should use the tougher rating until they have gained knowledge about 'playing' the fish.\nTraditionally a quiver-tip rod is used with at least four-pound line rating due to the weight of the ledger/feeder (heavier weights need heavier line). In feeder fishing, bait will be put on a hook and inside a swim-feeder which the current will cause to flow out and attract fish to the hook's position so it involves fishing upstream of where the fish are, this usually involves smaller baits like bread, sweetcorn or maggots. The same applies to ledgering except there is a weight (called a ledger) instead of a swim-feeder and usually heavier baits are used here such as luncheon meat. Another method known as touch-ledgering can be used which involves not using a quiver-tip but instead holding the line that is loose off the reel and feeling for any pulls or the line going loose. Some anglers do this without any weights and let the bait slowly drift downstream with the line steadily moving through their hands, slugs and luncheon meat are excellent for this method.\nThis method could involve fishing under the rod-tip in deep water or letting the float gently drift to where the fish may be situated (known as trotting) whilst throwing portions of bait in the stream to encourage feeding. Usually a lighter rod may be used (no more than ten-foot) and sometimes a centrepin reel is used as it allows the line to smoothly come off the reel. Anglers must strike quickly when trotting as bites can be easy to miss sometimes. Drifting baits such as bread, sweetcorn and maggots are usually used here.\nThis method is usually for the larger chub, a light spinning/lure rod with a fixed-spool reel of at least 10 pounds line rating as it is easy to snag onto debris when doing this method. Small lures such as bar-spoons and spoons or even small soft-plastics can imitate the smaller fish such as minnows that the larger chub feed on.\nUsing flies such as damselfly patterns or even larger, dark patterns such as those that imitate slugs can be very good if presented correctly. More obvious, shiny flies that imitate small fish may work for more aggressive chub, this method is all-year but best in warmer months. Nymph patterns also do well. In late summer grass hopper and beetle fly patterns also work very well.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most of the artificial objects in outer space are in LEO, peaking in number at an altitude around , while the farthest in LEO, before medium Earth orbit (MEO), have an altitude of 2,000 kilometers, about one-third of the radius of Earth and near the beginning of the inner Van Allen radiation belt.\nThe term \"LEO region\" is used for the area of space below an altitude of (about one-third of Earth's radius). Objects in orbits that pass through this zone, even if they have an apogee further out or are sub-orbital, are carefully tracked since they present a collision risk to the many LEO satellites.\nNo human spaceflights other than the lunar missions of the Apollo program (1968\u20131972) have gone beyond LEO. Artemis II is also planned to go beyond LEO in early 2026. All space stations to date have operated geocentric within LEO.\nDefining characteristics.\nA wide variety of sources define LEO in terms of altitude. The altitude of an object in an elliptic orbit can vary significantly along the orbit. Even for circular orbits, the altitude above ground can vary by as much as (especially for polar orbits) due to the oblateness of Earth's spheroid figure and local topography. While definitions based on altitude are inherently ambiguous, most of them fall within the range specified by an orbit period of 128 minutes because, according to Kepler's third law, this corresponds to a semi-major axis of . For circular orbits, this in turn corresponds to an altitude of above the mean radius of Earth, which is consistent with some of the upper altitude limits in some LEO definitions.\nThe LEO region is defined by some sources as a region in space that LEO orbits occupy. Some highly elliptical orbits may pass through the LEO region near their lowest altitude (or perigee) but are not in a LEO orbit because their highest altitude (or apogee) exceeds . Sub-orbital objects can also reach the LEO region but are not in a LEO orbit because they re-enter the atmosphere. The distinction between LEO orbits and the LEO region is especially important for analysis of possible collisions between objects which may not themselves be in LEO but could collide with satellites or debris in LEO orbits.\nOrbital characteristics.\nThe mean orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low Earth orbit is about , which translates to . However, this depends on the exact altitude of the orbit. Calculated for a circular orbit of the orbital velocity is , but for a higher orbit the velocity is reduced to . The launch vehicle's delta-v needed to achieve low Earth orbit starts around .\nThe pull of gravity in LEO is only slightly less than on the Earth's surface. This is because the distance to LEO from the Earth's surface is much less than the Earth's radius. However, an object in orbit is in a permanent free fall around Earth, because in orbit the gravitational force and the centrifugal force balance each other out. As a result, spacecraft in orbit continue to stay in orbit, and people inside or outside such craft continuously experience weightlessness.\nObjects in LEO orbit Earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner Van Allen radiation belt. They encounter atmospheric drag from gases in the thermosphere (approximately 80\u2013600\u00a0km above the surface) or exosphere (approximately and higher), depending on orbit height. Satellites in orbits that reach altitudes below decay quickly due to atmospheric drag. \nEquatorial low Earth orbits (ELEO) are a subset of LEO. These orbits, with low orbital inclination, allow rapid revisit times over low-latitude locations on Earth. Prograde equatorial LEOs also have lower delta-v launch requirements because they take advantage of the Earth's rotation. Other useful LEO orbits, including polar orbits and Sun-synchronous orbits, have higher inclinations to the equator and provide coverage for higher latitudes on Earth. Some of the first generation of Starlink satellites used polar orbits which provide coverage everywhere on Earth. Later Starlink constellations orbit at a lower inclination and provide more coverage for populated areas.\nHigher orbits include medium Earth orbit (MEO), sometimes called intermediate circular orbit (ICO), and further above, geostationary orbit (GEO). Orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation.\nIn 2017, \"very low Earth orbits\" (VLEO) began to be seen in regulatory filings. These orbits, below about , require the use of novel technologies for orbit raising because they operate in orbits that would ordinarily decay too soon to be economically useful.\nUse.\nA low Earth orbit requires the lowest amount of energy for satellite placement. It provides high bandwidth and low communication latency. Satellites and space stations in LEO are more accessible for crew and servicing.\nSince it requires less energy to place a satellite into a LEO, and a satellite there needs less powerful amplifiers for successful transmission, LEO is used for many communication applications, such as the Iridium phone system. Some communication satellites use much higher geostationary orbits and move at the same angular velocity as the Earth as to appear stationary above one location on the planet.\nDisadvantages.\nUnlike geosynchronous satellites, satellites in low orbit have a small field of view and can only observe and communicate with a fraction of the Earth at a given time. This means that a large network (or constellation) of satellites is required to provide continuous coverage.\nSatellites at lower altitudes of orbit are in the atmosphere and suffer from rapid orbital decay, requiring either periodic re-boosting to maintain stable orbits, or the launching of replacements for those that re-enter the atmosphere. The effects of adding such quantities of vaporized metals to Earth's stratosphere are potentially of concern but currently unknown.\nSpace debris.\nThe LEO environment is becoming congested with space debris because of the frequency of object launches. This has caused growing concern in recent years, since collisions at orbital velocities can be dangerous or deadly. Collisions can produce additional space debris, creating a domino effect known as Kessler syndrome. NASA's Orbital Debris Program tracks over 25,000 objects larger than 10 cm diameter in LEO, while the estimated number between 1 and 10 cm is 500,000, and the number of particles bigger than 1 mm exceeds 100 million. The particles travel at speeds up to , so even a small impact can severely damage a spacecraft.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47569", "revid": "48535054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47569", "title": "Appian Way", "text": "Ancient Roman road\nThe Appian Way (Latin and ) is one of the earliest and strategically most important Roman roads of the ancient republic. It connected Rome to Brindisi, in southeast Italy. Its importance is indicated by its common name, recorded by Statius, of ('the Appian Way, the queen of the long roads'). The road is named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who, during the Samnite Wars, began and completed the first section as a military road to the south in 312 BC.\nIn July 2024, the Appian Way entered the UNESCO World Heritage List.\nOrigins.\nDevelopment.\nThe Appian Way was a Roman road that the Republic used as a main route for military supplies for its conquest of southern Italy in 312 BC and for improvements in communication.\nThe Appian Way\u00a0\u2014 essential to the Romans\u00a0\u2014 was the first long road built specifically to transport troops outside the smaller region of greater Rome. The few roads outside the early city were Etruscan and went mainly to Etruria. By the late Republic, the Romans had expanded over most of Italy and were masters of road construction. Their roads began at Rome, where the master , or list of destinations along the roads, was located, and extended to the borders of their domain, hence the expression, \"All roads lead to Rome\".\nThe Samnite Wars.\nRomans had an affinity for the people of Campania, who, like themselves, traced their backgrounds to the Etruscans. The Samnite Wars were instigated by the Samnites when Rome attempted to ally itself with the city of Capua in Campania. The Italic speakers in Latium had long ago been subdued and incorporated into the Roman state. They were responsible for changing Rome from a primarily Etruscan to a primarily Italic state.\nDense populations of sovereign Samnites remained in the mountains north of Capua, which is just north of the Greek city of Neapolis. Around 343 BC, Rome and Capua attempted to form an alliance. The Samnites reacted with military force.\nThe barrier of the Pontine Marshes.\nBetween Capua and Rome lay the Pontine Marshes (\"Pomptinae paludes\"), a swamp infested with malaria. A tortuous coastal road wound between Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber and Neapolis. The Via Latina followed its ancient and scarcely more accessible path along the foothills of Monti Laziali and Monti Lepini, which are visible towering over the former marsh.\nIn the First Samnite War (343\u2013341\u00a0BC) the Romans found they could not support or resupply troops in the field against the Samnites across the marsh. A revolt of the Latin League drained their resources further. They gave up the attempted alliance and settled with Samnium.\nColonization to the southeast.\nThe Romans were only biding their time while they looked for a solution. The first answer was the colonia, a \"cultivation\" of settlers from Rome, who would maintain a permanent base of operations. The Second Samnite War (327\u2013304\u00a0BC) erupted when Rome attempted to place a colony at Cales in 334 BC and again at Fregellae in 328 BC on the other side of the marshes. The Samnites, now a major power after defeating the Greeks of Tarentum, occupied Neapolis to try to ensure its loyalty. The Neapolitans appealed to Rome, which sent an army and expelled the Samnites from Neapolis.\nAppius Claudius' beginning of the works.\nIn 312\u00a0BC, Appius Claudius Caecus became censor at Rome. He was of the gens Claudia, who were patricians descended from the Sabines taken into the early Roman state. He had been given the name of the founding ancestor of the gens, Appius Claudius (Attus Clausus in Sabine). He was a populist, i.e., an advocate of the common people. A man of discernment and perception, in the years of success he was said to have lost his eyesight and thus acquired the name , 'blind'. In antique literature, blindness was sometimes associated with great vision, cf. Homer.\nWithout waiting to be told what to do by the Senate, Appius Claudius began bold public works to address the supply problem. An aqueduct (the Aqua Appia) secured the water supply of the city of Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the Pontine Marshes to the coast northwest of Naples, where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. It is no surprise that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became consul twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.\nSuccess of the road.\nThe road achieved its purpose. The outcome of the Second Samnite War was at last favorable to Rome. In a series of blows the Romans reversed their fortunes, bringing Etruria to the table in 311\u00a0BC, the very year of their revolt, and Samnium in 304 BC. The road was the main factor that allowed them to concentrate their forces with sufficient rapidity and to keep them adequately supplied, whereafter they became a formidable opponent.\nConstruction.\nThe main part of the Appian Way was started and completed in 312\u00a0BC.\nThe road began as a leveled dirt path on which small stones and mortar were laid. This base was covered with gravel, and finally topped with tightly fitting, interlocking stones to create a flat and durable surface. The historian Procopius remarked that the stones fit together so securely and precisely that they appeared to have grown together rather than been set by hand. The road was cambered in the middle to allow for water runoff and flanked by ditches on either side, which were protected by retaining walls.\nBetween Rome and Lake Albano.\nThe road began in the Forum Romanum, passed through the Servian Wall at the porta Capena, went through a cutting in the clivus Martis, and left the city. For this stretch of the road, the builders used the Via Latina. The building of the Aurelian Wall centuries later required the placing of another gate, the Porta Appia. Outside of Rome the new Via Appia went through well-to-do suburbs along the Via Norba, the ancient track to the Alban hills, where Norba was situated. The road at the time was a via glarea, a gravel road. The Romans built a high-quality road, with layers of cemented stone over a layer of small stones, cambered, drainage ditches on either side, low retaining walls on sunken portions, and dirt pathways for sidewalks. The Via Appia is believed to have been the first Roman road to feature the use of lime cement. The materials were volcanic rock. The surface was said to have been so smooth that you could not distinguish the joints. The Roman section still exists and is lined with monuments of all periods, although the cement has eroded out of the joints, leaving a very rough surface.\nAcross the marsh.\nThe road concedes nothing to the Alban hills, but goes straight through them over cuts and fills. The gradients are steep. Then it enters the former Pontine Marshes. A stone causeway of about led across stagnant and foul-smelling pools blocked from the sea by sand dunes. Appius Claudius planned to drain the marsh, taking up earlier attempts, but he failed. The causeway and its bridges subsequently needed constant repair. In 162\u00a0BC, Marcus Cornelius Cathegus had a canal constructed along the road to relieve the traffic and provide an alternative when the road was being repaired. Romans preferred using the canal.\nAlong the coast.\nThe Via Appia picked up the coastal road at Tarracina (Terracina). However, the Romans straightened it somewhat with cuttings, which form cliffs today. From there the road swerved north to Capua, where, for the time being, it ended. The Caudine Forks were not far to the north. The itinerary was Aricia (Ariccia), Tres Tabernae, Forum Appii, Tarracina, Fundi (Fondi), Formiae (Formia), Minturnae (Minturno), Suessa, Casilinum and Capua, but some of these were colonies added after the Samnite Wars. The length of the Appian Way from Rome to Capua was 132 Roman miles (). The original road had no milestones, as they were not yet in use. A few survive from later times, including a first milestone near the Porta Appia.\nExtension to Beneventum.\nThe Third Samnite War (298\u2013290\u00a0BC) is perhaps misnamed. It was an all-out attempt by all the neighbors of Rome: Italics, Etruscans and Gauls, to check the power of Rome. The Samnites were the leading people of the conspiracy. Rome dealt the northerners a crushing blow at the Battle of Sentinum in Umbria in 295. The Samnites fought on alone. Rome now placed 13 colonies in Campania and Samnium. It must have been during this time that they extended the Via Appia 35 miles beyond Capua past the Caudine Forks to a place the Samnites called Maloenton, \"passage of the flocks\". The itinerary added Calatia, Caudium and Beneventum (not yet called that). Here also ended the Via Latina.\nExtension to Apulia and Calabria.\nBy 290\u00a0BC, the sovereignty of the Samnites had ended. The heel of Italy lay open to the Romans. The dates are somewhat uncertain and there is considerable variation in the sources, but during the Third Samnite War the Romans seem to have extended the road to Venusia, where they placed a colony of 20,000\u00a0men. After that they were at Tarentum.\nRoman expansion alarmed Tarentum, the leading city of the Greek presence (Magna Graecia) in southern Italy. They hired the mercenary King Pyrrhus of Epirus in neighboring Greece to fight the Romans on their behalf. In 280\u00a0BC the Romans suffered a defeat at the hands of Pyrrhus at the Battle of Heraclea on the coast west of Tarentum. The battle was costly for both sides, prompting Pyrrhus to remark \"One more such victory and I am lost.\" Making the best of it, the Roman army turned on Greek Rhegium and effected a massacre of Pyrrhian partisans there.\nRather than pursue them, Pyrrhus went straight for Rome along the Via Appia and then the Via Latina. He knew that if he continued on the Via Appia he could be trapped in the marsh. Wary of such entrapment on the Via Latina also, he withdrew without fighting after encountering opposition at Anagni. Wintering in Campania, he withdrew to Apulia in 279\u00a0BC, where, pursued by the Romans, he won a second costly victory at the Battle of Asculum. Withdrawing from Apulia for a Sicilian interlude, he returned to Apulia in 275\u00a0BC and started for Campania up the Roman road.\nSupplied by that same road, the Romans successfully defended the region against Pyrrhus, crushing his army in a two-day fight at the Battle of Beneventum in 275\u00a0BC. The Romans renamed the town from \"Maleventum\" (\"site of bad events\") to Beneventum (\"site of good events\") as a result. Pyrrhus withdrew to Greece, where he died in a street fight in Argos in 272\u00a0BC. Tarentum fell to the Romans that same year, who proceeded to consolidate their rule over all of Italy.\nThe Romans pushed the Via Appia to the port of Brundisium in 264\u00a0BC. The itinerary from Beneventum was now Aeculanum, Forum Aemilii, Venusia, Silvium, Tarentum, Uria and Brundisium. The Roman Republic was the government of Italy, for the time being. Appius Claudius died in 273, but in extending the road a number of times, no one has tried to displace his name upon it.\nRediscovery.\nThe Appian Way's path across today's regions Lazio and Campania has always been well known, but the exact position of the part located in Apulia (the original one, not the extension by Trajan) was long unknown, since there were no visible remains of the Appian Way in that region.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the professor of ancient Roman topography Giuseppe Lugli managed to discover, with the then-innovative technique of photogrammetry, what probably was the route of the Appian Way from Gravina in Puglia (\"Silvium\") up to Taranto. When analysing aerophotogrammetric shots of the area, Lugli noticed a path () named \"la Tarantina\", whose direction was still largely influenced by the centuriation; this, according to Lugli, was the path of the Appian Way. This path, as well as the part located in today's Apulia region, was still in use in the Middle Ages. A further piece of evidence for Lugli's proposed path is the presence of a number of archaeological remains in that region, among them the ancient settlement of Jesce.\nBy studying the distances given in the Antonine Itinerary, Lugli also assigned the Appian Way stations \"Blera\" and \"Sublupatia\" (which also occurs on the \"Tabula Peutingeriana\") respectively to the areas \"Murgia Catena\" and \"Taverna\" (between masseria (estate farmhouse) S. Filippo and masseria S. Pietro). However, the toponym \"Murgia Catena\" defined too large an area, not allowing a clear localization of the Appian Way station. More recently Luciano Piepoli, based on the distances given in the Antonine Itinerary and on newer archeological findings, has suggested that \"Silvium\" should be \"Santo Staso\", an area very close to Gravina in Puglia, \"Blera\" should be \"masseria Castello\", and \"Sublupatia\" should be \"masseria Caione\".\nMain branches.\nSince the latter stretch of the Appian Way turned out to be very impervious, some branches were created: first the Via Aemilia, then the Via Minucia, finally the emperor Trajan built the Via Traiana, a branch of the Via Appia from Beneventum, reaching Brundisium via Canusium and Barium rather than via Tarentum. This was commemorated by an arch at Beneventum.\nTravellers could cross the Adriatic Sea through the Otranto Strait towards Albania either by landing at present day Durr\u00ebs through the Via Egnatia or near the ancient town of Apollonia and continue towards present day Rrogozhin\u00eb in central Albania.\nNotable historical events along the road.\nCrucifixion of Spartacus's army.\nIn 73\u00a0BC, a slave revolt (known as the Third Servile War) under the ex-gladiator of Capua, Spartacus, began against the Romans. Slaves accounted for roughly every third person in Italy.\nSpartacus defeated many Roman armies in a conflict that lasted for over two years. While trying to escape from Italy at Brundisium he unwittingly moved his forces into the historic trap at Apulia in Calabria. The Romans were well acquainted with the region. Legions were brought home from abroad and Spartacus was pinned between armies. The ex-slave army was defeated at the Siler River by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Pompey's armies captured and killed several thousand rebels that escaped from the battle and Crassus captured several thousand more. The Romans judged that the slaves had forfeited their right to live. In 71\u00a0BC, 6,000 slaves were crucified along the Via Appia from Rome to Capua.\nWorld War II, Battle of Anzio.\nIn 1943, during World War II, the Allies fell into the same trap Pyrrhus had retreated to avoid, in the Pomptine fields, the successor to the Pontine Marshes. The marsh remained, despite many efforts to drain it, until engineers working for Benito Mussolini finally succeeded (even so, the fields were infested with malarial mosquitos until the advent of DDT in the 1950s).\nHoping to break a stalemate at Monte Cassino, the Allies landed on the coast of Italy at the Anzio-Nettuno area \u2013 ancient Antium \u2013 which was midway between Ostia and Terracina. They found that the place was undefended. They intended to move along the line of the Via Appia to take Rome, outflanking Monte Cassino, but they did not do so quickly enough. The Germans occupied Mounts Laziali and Lepini along the track of the old Via Latina, from which they rained down shells on Anzio. Even though the Allies expanded into all the Pomptine region, they gained no ground. The Germans counterattacked down the via Appia from the Alban hills in a front four miles wide, but could not retake Anzio. The battle lasted for four months, one side being supplied by sea, the other by land through Rome. In May 1944, the Allies broke out of Anzio and took Rome. The German forces escaped to the north of Florence.\n1960 Summer Olympics.\nDuring the 1960 Summer Olympics, the Via Appia was part of the course of the men's marathon. The event was won by Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia.\nMain sights.\nVia Appia Antica.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the road fell out of use; Pope Pius VI ordered its restoration. A new Appian Way was built in parallel with the old one in 1784 as far as the Alban Hills region. The new road is the Via Appia Nuova ('New Appian Way') as opposed to the old section, now known as Via Appia Antica. The old Appian Way close to Rome is now a free tourist attraction. It was extensively restored for Rome's Millennium and Great Jubilee celebrations. The first are still heavily used by cars, buses and coaches but from then on traffic is very light and the ruins can be explored on foot in relative safety. The Church of Domine Quo Vadis is in the second mile of the road. Along or close to the part of the road closest to Rome, there are three catacombs of Roman and early Christian origin and one of Jewish origin.\nThe construction of Rome's ring road, the Grande Raccordo Anulare or GRA, in 1951 caused the Appian Way to be cut in two. More recent improvements to the GRA have rectified this through the construction of a tunnel under the Appia, so that it is now possible to follow the Appia on foot for about from its beginning near the Baths of Caracalla.\nMany parts of the original road beyond Rome's environs have been preserved, and some are now used by cars (for example, in the area of Velletri). The road inspires the last movement of Ottorino Respighi's \"Pini di Roma\". To this day the Via Appia contains the longest stretch of straight road in Europe, totaling .\nMonuments along the Via Appia.\nBridges along the road.\nThere are the remains of several Roman bridges along the road, including the Ponte di Tre Ponti, Ponte di Vigna Capoccio, Viadotta di Valle Ariccia, Ponte Alto and Ponte Antico.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The genus \"Esox\" is placed in the family Esocidae (in the order Esociformes). \nTwo subspecies are sometimes recognised:\nLesueur originally classified the grass pickerel as \"E. vermiculatus,\" but it is now considered a subspecies of \"E. americanus.\"\nThere is no widely accepted English common collective name for the two \"E. americanus\" subspecies; \"American pickerel\" is a translation of the French systematic name \"brochet d'Am\u00e9rique.\"\nDescription.\nThe two subspecies are very similar, but the grass pickerel lacks the redfin's distinctive orange to red fin coloration. The former's fins have dark leading edges and amber to dusky coloration. In addition, the light areas between the dark bands are generally wider on the grass pickerel and narrower on the redfin pickerel. Record size grass and redfin pickerels can weigh around and reach lengths of around . Redfin and grass pickerels are typically smaller than chain pickerels, which can be much larger.\nDistribution and habitats.\nThe redfin and grass pickerels occur primarily in sluggish, vegetated waters of pools, lakes and wetlands, and are carnivorous predators feeding on smaller fish. However, larger fishes, such as the striped bass (\"Morone saxatilis\"), bowfin (\"Amia calva\") and gray weakfish (\"Cynoscion regalis\"), prey on the pickerels in turn when the latter venture into larger rivers or estuaries.\nThe pickerels reproduce by scattering spherical, sticky eggs in shallow, heavily vegetated waters. The eggs hatch in 11\u201315 days; the adult pickerels guard neither the eggs nor the young.\nBoth subspecies are native to the freshwater bodies of North America, and are not to be confused with their more aggressive big cousin, the northern pike. The redfin pickerel's range extends from the Saint Lawrence basin in Quebec down to the Gulf Coast, from Mississippi to Florida; while the grass pickerel's range is further west, extending from the Great Lakes Basin, from Ontario to Michigan, down to the western Gulf Coast, from eastern Texas to Mississippi.\nFishing.\nThe \"E. americanus\" subspecies are not as highly prized as a game fish as their larger cousins, the northern pike and muskellunge, but they are nevertheless caught by anglers. \"McClane's Standard Fishing Encyclopedia\" describes ultralight tackle as a sporty if overlooked method to catch these small but voracious pikes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The weakfish can live up to 17 years but have an average lifespan of 9 to 12 years (Chesapeake).\nDiet.\n\"Cynoscion regalis\" preys on a wide variety of species, including, small schooling fish like anchovies and Atlantic Menhaden, assorted crabs, shrimp, mollusks, and even large zooplankton. Weakfish move toward their prey slowly and once upon them they attack aggressively with an open jaw (Chesapeake).\nAlthough being a predatory fish and on a higher trophic level the weakfish are also a food source for other larger fish. Some examples of fish that prey on weakfish include the bluefish, the striped bass, and the dusky shark (Chesapeake).\nBreeding.\n\"Cynoscion regalis\" mainly spawn from April to August. This spawning takes place in the shallow waters of estuaries. Their young are in the form of zooplankton, floating freely with the tidal current. They flow with these currents until reaching their nursery area of low salinity rivers. Once these fish grow large enough in these areas, they begin to migrate back to the saltier waters to which they were spawned. They stay in these intertidal bay zone until winter, then join the schooling fish towards deeper offshore waters. The males have the ability to perform a deep croaking sound as shown by the Chesapeake Bay field guide (Chesapeake). The reason why these fish have the capability to do this is because they are a part of the drum family. This trait is very common in species that belong to the drum family and is commonly used for mating purposes. It is believed that weakfish also use this to attract other females as stated in a study done at the University of Michigan, \"There is some evidence that the male weakfish croaking sound may be used in attracting a mate and playing a role in the spawning behavior. This is because the male's sonic muscles, which are used to produce 'drumming' and 'croaking' sounds, increases three times its usual mass during spawning season\" (Gillum). This study shows that weakfish make use of their drum sound more frequently during the mating season, suggesting that it is used as a process for males to attract females.\nBehavior.\n\"Cynoscion regalis\" are schooling fish, meaning that they spend a large majority of their time swimming together either trying to evade larger predators, or trying to feed more efficiently on prey. Studies done by the university of Michigan state that these schooling patterns tend to become much tighter in signs of stress as they state, \"weakfish have an acute chemosensory response mechanism. In times of stress, weakfish gather into tighter schools, this was seen in lab studies when higher temperatures were used. The weakfish under these conditions showed a 35% decrease in their distance to the other fish in the school. Also the frequency of school formation increased in response to stress\" (Gillum). Weakfish school closer together when in situations of high stress in this study done by the university of Michigan. Theorizing that they use schooling as a form of protection. \nEconomic importance.\n\"Cynoscion regalis\" is excellent table fare; they can be used as a food source. The weakfish are recreationally fished and provide tackle shops with business. \nRecreational fishing.\n\"Cynoscion regalis\" are finicky. They are very shy and prey selective; making them a harder fish to target recreationally, this provides a good challenge for anglers. They prefer a water temperature ranging from 50 degree F to 65 degrees F. This is the best time to target weakfish, as they are most actively breeding within these temperatures. They can be found feeding in temperatures exclusive to these numbers, but they may be much more finicky and hard to hook. The weakfish also have a very fragile mouth, making it hard for anglers to keep them from spitting the hook.\nConservation.\n\"Cynoscion regalis\" has its main breeding grounds in the near shore estuaries of the Chesapeake Bay. \"The most important habitat for the weakfish is the brackish waters of the Chesapeake bay\" (Gillum). This is where the vast majority of weakfish breed, to maintain a healthy population of weakfish these areas must be preserved. The weakfish experienced a crash that was recognized in 2009 as stated by John McMurray in the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, \"A 2009 stock assessment found that weakfish were badly depleted. The stock had reached an all-time low of 2.9 million pounds, far below the \"biomass threshold\" of 22.4 million pounds, which is what scientists would consider a healthy stock. This is an astonishing drop, since the East Coast harvest in 1980 was 80 million pounds\" (McMurray).\nNatural mortality of this species has increased since the mid 1990s from 0.16 to an average of 0.93 from 2007 to 2014 but the underlying cause is still unknown. Given the decline in SSB in excess of 60% over three generation lengths and the unknown driver of increasing natural mortality, this species is listed as Endangered A2b with an urgent need for additional research to determine the driver of increasing natural mortality.\nCurrent fishing regulations.\n\"Cynoscion regalis\" is a target for the recreational anglers and each individual state has its own size limit, possession limit, and season for targeting and collecting weakfish. For example, in the state of New Jersey, recreational anglers are allowed 1 fish that is greater than 13 inches at any time of the year as shown by the New Jersey Department of Environmental protection (NJ wildlife). Under Florida regulations weakfish are considered partially regulated, but there is a 100 lbs limit of unregulated fish including sand seatrout and silver seatrout per day outside of the Weakfish Management Zone. The Weakfish Management Zone includes state waters from the Florida-Georgia line to the southernmost tip of Amelia Island, the inland waters of Nassau County and the St. Marys River. The regulations in the zone are to protect mainly the purebred weakfish, as they are relatively rare in Florida outside of this zone. Sand seatrout and silver seatrout are species of least concern.\nIn human culture.\n\"Cynoscion regalis\" is the state fish of Delaware.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has also been widely introduced into inland recreational fisheries across the United States. Striped bass found in the Gulf of Mexico are a separate strain referred to as Gulf Coast striped bass.\nThe striped bass is the state fish of Maryland, Rhode Island, and South Carolina, and the state saltwater (marine) fish of New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and New Hampshire. It is generally called the striped bass north of New Jersey, rockfish south of New Jersey, and both in New Jersey.\nThe history of the striped bass fishery in North America dates back to the Colonial period. Many written accounts by some of the first European settlers describe the immense abundance of striped bass, along with alewives, traveling and spawning up most rivers in the coastal Northeast.\nMorphology and lifespan.\nThe striped bass is a typical member of the family Moronidae in shape, having a streamlined, silvery body marked with longitudinal dark stripes running from behind the gills to the base of the tail. Common mature size is . The largest specimen recorded was , netted in 1896. Striped bass are believed to live for up to 30 years. The average size in length is and approximately , but varies based on the fish's age and sex.\nDistribution.\nNatural distribution.\nStriped bass are native to the Atlantic coastline of North America from the St. Lawrence River into the Gulf of Mexico to Louisiana. They are anadromous fish that migrate between fresh and salt water. Spawning takes place in fresh water.\nIntroductions outside their natural range.\nStriped bass have been introduced to the Pacific Coast of North America and into many large reservoir impoundments across the United States by state game and fish commissions for recreational fishing and as a predator to control populations of gizzard shad. These include: Elephant Butte Lake in New Mexico; Lake Ouachita, Lake Norman in North Carolina; Lake Norfork, Beaver Lake and Lake Hamilton in Arkansas; Lake Thunderbird in Illinois; Lake Pleasant, and Lake Havasu in Arizona; Lake Powell along the Arizona/Utah border; Castaic Lake, Pyramid Lake, Silverwood Lake, Diamond Valley Lake, and San Francisco Bay-Delta in California; Lewis Smith Lake in Alabama; Lake Cumberland in Kentucky; Lake George in Florida; Lake Murray in South Carolina; Lake Lanier in Georgia; Watts Bar Lake, in Tennessee; Lake Mead, Nevada; Lake Texoma on the border of Texas and Oklahoma, Lake Tawakoni, Lake Whitney, https://, Possum Kingdom Lake, and Lake Buchanan in Texas; Raystown Lake in Pennsylvania; Lake Wallenpaupack in Northeastern Pennsylvania; Umpqua River in Oregon and in Virginia's Smith Mountain Lake and Leesville Reservoir.\nStriped bass have also been introduced into waters in Ecuador, Iran, Latvia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey, primarily for sport fishing and aquaculture.\nEnvironmental factors.\nThe spawning success of striped bass has been studied in the San Francisco Bay-Delta water system, with a finding that high total dissolved solids (TDS) reduce spawning. At levels as low as 200\u00a0mg/L TDS, an observable diminution of spawning productivity occurs. They can be found in lakes, ponds, streams, and wetlands.\nThough the population of striped bass was growing and repopulating in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, a study executed by the Wildlife and Fisheries Program at West Virginia University found that the rapid growth of the striped bass population was exerting a tremendous pressure on its prey (river herring, shad, and blueback herring). This pressure on their food source was putting their own population at risk due to the population of prey naturally not coming back to the same spawning areas.\nIn the United States, the striped bass was designated as a protected game fish in 2007, and executive agencies were directed to use existing legal authorities to prohibit the sale of striped bass caught in federal waters in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina have designated striped bass as a game fish in state waters.\nIn Canada, the province of Quebec designated the striped bass population of the Saint Lawrence as extirpated in 1996. Analysis of available data implicated overfishing and dredging in the disappearance. In 2002, a reintroduction program was successful.\nLife cycle.\nStriped bass spawn in fresh water, and although they have been successfully adapted to freshwater habitat, they naturally spend their adult lives in saltwater (i.e., they are anadromous). Five important bodies of water with breeding stocks of striped bass are: Miramichi River, Chesapeake Bay, Massachusetts Bay/Cape Cod, Hudson River, and Delaware River. Many of the rivers and tributaries that emptied into the Atlantic, had at one time, bred stock of striped bass. This occurred until the 1860s. One of the largest breeding areas is the Chesapeake Bay, where populations from Chesapeake and Delaware bays have intermingled. The very few successful spawning populations of freshwater striped bass include Lake Texoma, Lake Weiss (Coosa River), the Colorado River and its reservoirs downstream from and including Lake Powell, and the Arkansas River, as well as Lake Marion (South Carolina) that retained a landlocked breeding population when the dam was built; other freshwater fisheries must be restocked with hatchery-produced fish annually. Stocking of striped bass was discontinued at Lake Mead in 1973 once natural reproduction was verified.\nHybrids with other bass.\nStriped bass have also been hybridized with white bass to produce hybrid striped bass also known as wiper, whiterock bass, sunshine bass, palmetto bass, and Cherokee bass. These hybrids have been stocked in many freshwater areas across the US.\nFishing for striped bass.\nStriped bass are of significant value for sport fishing, and have been introduced to many waterways outside their natural range. A variety of angling methods are used, including trolling and surf casting. Lures such as wooden plugs, plastic swimmers, poppers, and metal spoons all work very well for fishing off of the surf. Using live and dead bait can also be an effective technique when targeting Striped bass from land. Striped bass take a number of live and fresh baits, including bunker, clams, eels, sandworms, herring, bloodworms, mackerel, shad, bluegill, and crayfish.\nThe largest striped bass ever taken by angling was an specimen taken from a boat in Long Island Sound, near the Outer Southwest Reef, off the coast of Westbrook, Connecticut. The all-tackle world record fish was taken by Gregory Myerson on the night of August 4, 2011. The fish took a drifted live eel bait, and fought for 20 minutes before being boated by Myerson. A second hook and leader was discovered in the fish's mouth when it was boated, indicating it had been previously hooked by another angler. The fish measured 54 in long and had a girth of 36 in. The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) declared Myerson's catch the new all-tackle world record striped bass on October 19, 2011. In addition to now holding the all-tackle record, Meyerson's catch also landed him the new IGFA men's 37\u00a0kg (80 -lb) line class record for striped bass, which previously stood at 70\u00a0lb. The previous all-tackle world record fish was a specimen taken in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on September 21, 1982, by Albert McReynolds, who fought the fish from the beach for an hour and 20 minutes after it took his Rebel artificial lure. On March 20, 2023, then 12-year-old Henry Bulgin set the first Junior IGFA All-Tackle Length world record by landing a striped bass while fishing the Chesapeake Bay just south of Annapolis, Maryland, but this was beaten by the end of that year by a specimen in the same bay, just off Virginia. Recreational bag limits vary by state and province. On July 4, 2008, David Hochman shot a 68.4 lb specimen off the coast of Rhode Island to set the world record for Striped Bass taken by speargun.\nLandlocked striped bass.\nStriped bass are anadromous, so their upriver spawning migrations led some individuals to become \"landlocked\" during lake dam constructions. The first area where this was documented was at the Santee-Cooper River during the construction of the two dams that impounded Lakes Moultrie and Marion, and because of this, the state game fish of South Carolina is the striped bass.\nRecently, biologists came to believe that striped bass stayed in rivers for long periods of time, with some not returning to sea unless temperature changes forced migration. Once fishermen and biologists caught on to rising striped bass populations, many state natural resources departments started stocking striped bass in local lakes. Striped bass still continue to exhibit upstream migrations from freshwater lakes during the spawning period. Landlocked stripers have a hard time reproducing naturally, and one of the few and most successful rivers in which they have been documented reproducing successfully is the Coosa River in Alabama and Georgia.\nA landlocked bass was caught in February 2013 by James R. Bramlett on the Warrior River in Alabama, a current world record. This fish had a length of and a girth of .\nA self-sustaining population of striped bass also exist in Lake Texoma, a brackish lake.\nIn Canada there are no landlocked striped bass, but a large number of bass overwinter in Grand Lake, Nova Scotia. They migrate out in early April into the Shubenacadie River to spawn. These bass also spawn in the Stewiacke River (a tributary of the Shubenacadie). The Shubenacadie River system is one of five known spawning areas in Canada for striped bass, with the others being the St. Lawerence River, Miramichi River, Saint John River, Annapolis River, and Shubenacadie/Stewiacke Rivers.\nManagement.\nThe striped bass population declined to less than 5 million by 1982, but efforts by fishermen with throw back lengths for smaller striped bass and management programs to rebuild the stock proved successful, and in 2007, the nearly 56\u00a0million fish included all ages. Recreational anglers and commercial fisherman caught an unprecedented 3.8\u00a0million fish in 2006. In New Jersey, alone among states, there is no legal commercial fishery for Striped Bass. The management of the species includes size limits, commercial quotas, and biological reference points for the health of the species.\nThe Atlantic coast-wide harvest of striped bass is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (AMSFC). In October 2019, the AMSFC announced that the 2018 Benchmark Stock Assessment indicated that \"the resource is overfished and experiencing overfishing.\" Following a series of hearings during March and April 2021 to gather public input, the ASMFC Striped Bass Technical Committee will make recommendations for a new 10-year management strategy, \"Amendment 7 to the Interstate Management Plan for Atlantic Striped Bass\", to replenish striped bass to sustainable levels throughout its traditional migratory range from North Carolina to Maine. Amendment 7 will be finalized and adopted in late 2021 and implemented in 2022. Conditions of the Striped bass fishery have continued to get worse with Striped bass stocks nearly at the low hit all the way back in 1985. There is major controversy in the fishing community on whether this data is correct because many anglers have seen great fishing in recent years.\nCulinary use.\nStriped bass has white meat with a mild flavor and a medium texture. It is extremely versatile in that it can be pan-seared, grilled, steamed, poached, roasted, broiled, saut\u00e9ed, and deep fried (including batter-frying). The flesh can also be eaten raw or pickled.\nThe primary market forms for fresh bass include headed and gutted (with the head and organs removed) and filets; the primary market forms for frozen bass include headed and gutted and loins. It can also be found in steaks, chunks, or whole. Fresh striped bass is available year-round, and is typically sold in sizes from two to fifteen pounds, and can be sold up to fifty pounds.\nStriped bass has firm and flavorful flesh with a large flake. The hybrid striped bass yields more meat, has a more fragile texture, and a blander flavor than wild striped bass. The fish has a mild and distinctive flavor. In recipes, it can be substituted for milder fish like cod, as well as for stronger fish like bluefish. Other fish can substitute it, including weakfish, tilefish, blackfish, small bluefish, catfish, salmon, swordfish, and shark. Striped bass is easily grilled in fillets, and is therefore popular in beach communities.\nIn Virginia, anadromous striped bass caught from the Chesapeake Bay and its small tidal tributaries have been found to be contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), leading to the issuance of a fish consumption advisory by the Virginia Department of Health.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the largest member of the pike family, Esocidae.\nOrigin of name.\nThe name \"muskellunge\" originates from the Ojibwe words \"maashkinoozhe\" meaning \"great fish\", \"mji-gnoozhe,\" \"maskino\u0161e\", or \"mashkinonge,\" meaning \"bad pike\", \"big pike\", or \"ugly pike\" respectively. The Algonquin word \"maskinunga\" is borrowed into the Canadian French words \"masquinong\u00e9\" or \"maskinong\u00e9\". In English, before settling on the common name \"muskellunge\", there were at least 94 common names applied to this species, including but not limited to: \"muskelunge\", \"muscallonge\", \"muskallonge\", \"milliganong\", \"maskinonge\", \"maskalonge\", \"mascalonge\", \"maskalung\", \"muskinunge\" and \"masquenongez\".\nDescription.\nMuskellunge closely resemble other esocids such as the northern pike (\"Esox lucius\") and American pickerel (\"E. americanus\") in both appearance and behavior. Like the northern pike and other aggressive pikes, the body plan is typical of ambush predators with an elongated body, flat head, and dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins set far back on the body. Muskellunge are typically long and weigh , though some have reached up to and almost . Martin Arthur Williamson caught a muskellunge with a weight of in November 2000 on Georgian Bay. The fish are a light silver, brown, or green, with dark vertical stripes on the flank, which may tend to break up into spots. In some cases, markings may be absent altogether, especially in fish from turbid waters. This is in contrast to northern pike, which have dark bodies with light markings. A reliable method to distinguish the two similar species is by counting the sensory pores on the underside of the mandible. A muskie will have seven or more per side, while the northern pike never has more than six. The lobes of the caudal (tail) fin in muskellunge come to a sharper point, while those of northern pike are more generally rounded. In addition, unlike pike, muskies have no scales on the lower half of their opercula.\nAnglers seek large muskies as trophies or for sport. In places where muskie are not native, such as in Maine, anglers are encouraged not to release the fish back into the water because of their negative impact on native populations of trout and other smaller fish species.\nHabitat.\nMuskellunge are found in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes and large rivers from Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota through the Great Lakes region, Chautauqua Lake in western New York, north into Canada, throughout most of the St Lawrence River drainage, and northward throughout the upper Mississippi valley, although the species also extends as far south as Chattanooga in the Tennessee River valley. Also, a small population is found in the Broad River in South Carolina. Several North Georgia reservoirs also have healthy stocked populations of muskie. They are also found in the Red River drainage of the Hudson Bay basin. Muskie were introduced to western Saint John River in the late 1960s and have now spread to many connecting waterways in northern Maine. The Pineview Reservoir in Utah is one of three Utah locations where the hybrid Tiger muskellunge is found.\nThey prefer clear waters where they lurk along weed edges, rock outcrops, or other structures to rest. A fish forms two distinct home ranges in summer: a shallow range and a deeper one. The shallow range is generally much smaller than the deeper range due to shallow water heating up. A muskie continually patrols the ranges in search of available food in the appropriate conditions of water temperature.\nDiet.\nMuskies are ambush predators who will swiftly bite their prey and then swallow it head first. Muskellunge are the top predator in any body of water where they occur and they will eat larger prey than most other freshwater fish. They eat all varieties of fish present in their ecosystem (including other muskellunge), along with the occasional insect, muskrat, rat, mouse, frog, or duck. They are capable of taking prey up to two-thirds of their body length due to their large stomachs. There have even been reports of large muskellunge attacking small dogs and even humans, although most of these reports are greatly exaggerated.\nLength and weight.\nAs muskellunge grow longer they increase in weight, but the relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between them can be expressed by a power-law equation:\nformula_1\nThe exponent b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant for each species. For muskellunge, b = 3.325, higher than for many common species, and c = .\nAccording to the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) the largest muskellunge on record was caught by Cal Johnson in Lac Courte Oreilles (recognized as Lake Courte Oreilles by the association), Hayward, Wisconsin, United States, on July 24, 1949. The fish weighed and was in length, and in girth.\nBehavior.\nMuskellunge are sometimes gregarious, forming small schools in distinct territories. Muskellunge feeding behavior is directly synchronized with the lunar cycle. During both full and new moons, an increase in feeding activity can be attributed to the increase of moonlight, as it most similarly simulates daytime feeding. They spawn in mid- to late spring, somewhat later than northern pike, over shallow, vegetated areas. A rock or sand bottom is preferred for spawning so the eggs do not sink into the mud and suffocate. The males arrive first and attempt to establish dominance over a territory. Spawning may last from five to 10 days and occurs mainly at night. The eggs are negatively buoyant and slightly adhesive; they adhere to plants and the bottom of the lake. Soon afterward, they are abandoned by the adults. Those embryos which are not eaten by fish, insects, or crayfish hatch within two weeks. The larvae live on yolk until the mouth is fully developed, when they begin to feed on copepods and other zooplankton. They soon begin to prey upon fish. Juveniles generally attain a length of by November of their first year.\nPredators.\nAdult muskellunge are apex predators where they occur naturally. Only humans and (rarely) large birds of prey such as bald eagles (\"Haliaeetus leucocephalus\") pose a threat to an adult. But juveniles are consumed by other muskies, northern pike, bass, trout, and occasionally birds of prey. The muskellunge's low reproductive rate and slow growth render populations highly vulnerable to overfishing. This has prompted some jurisdictions to institute artificial propagation programs in an attempt to maintain otherwise unsustainably high rates of angling effort and habitat destruction.\nSubspecies and hybrids.\nThough interbreeding with other pike species can complicate the classification of some individuals, zoologists usually recognize up to three subspecies of muskellunge.\nThe tiger muskellunge (\"E. masquinongy\" \u00d7 \"lucius\" or \"E. lucius\" \u00d7 \"masquinongy\") is a hybrid of the muskie and northern pike. Hybrids are sterile, although females sometimes unsuccessfully engage in spawning motions. Some hybrids are artificially produced and planted for anglers to catch. Tiger muskies grow faster than pure muskies, but do not attain the ultimate size of their pure relatives, as the tiger muskie does not live as long.\nAttacks on humans.\nAlthough very rare, muskie attacks on humans do occur on occasion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Other names for \"P.\u00a0pollachius\" include the Atlantic pollock, European pollock, , and lythe or lithe; while \"P.\u00a0virens\" is also known as Boston blue (distinct from bluefish) and silver bill.\nSpecies.\nThe recognized species in this genus are:\nDescription.\nBoth species can grow to . \"P.\u00a0virens\" can weigh up to and \"P.\u00a0pollachius\" can weigh up to . \"P.\u00a0virens\" has a strongly defined, silvery lateral line running down the sides. Above the lateral line, the colour is a greenish black. The belly is white, while \"P.\u00a0pollachius\" has a distinctly crooked lateral line, grayish to golden belly, and a dark brown back. \"P.\u00a0pollachius\" also has a strong underbite. It can be found in water up to deep over rocks and anywhere in the water column.\nAs food.\nAtlantic pollock is largely considered to be a whitefish. Traditionally a popular source of food in some countries, such as Norway, in the United Kingdom it has previously been largely consumed as a cheaper and versatile alternative to cod and haddock. However, in recent years, pollock has become more popular due to overfishing of cod and haddock. It can be found in most supermarkets as fresh fillets or prepared freezer items. For example, it is used minced in fish fingers or as an ingredient in imitation crab meat and is commonly used to make fish and chips.\nBecause of its slightly grey colour, pollock is often prepared, as in Norway, as fried fish balls, or if juvenile-sized, breaded with oatmeal and fried, as in Shetland. Year-old fish are traditionally split, salted, and dried over a peat hearth in Orkney, where their texture becomes wooden. Coalfish can also be salted and smoked and achieve a salmon-like orange color (although it is not closely related to the salmon), as is the case in Germany, where the fish is commonly sold as (\"sea salmon\").\nIn 2009, UK supermarket Sainsbury's briefly renamed Atlantic pollock \"colin\" in a bid to boost ecofriendly sales of the fish as an alternative to cod. Sainsbury's, which said the new name was derived from the French for cooked pollock (), launched the product under the banner \"Colin and chips can save British cod.\"\nPollock is regarded as a \"low-mercury fish\"\u00a0\u2013 a woman weighing can safely eat up to per week, and a child weighing can safely eat up to .\nOther fish called pollock.\nOne member of the genus \"Gadus\" is also commonly referred to as pollock: the Alaska pollock or walleye pollock (\"Gadus chalcogrammus\"), including the form known as the Norway pollock.

This species is found in the Western Atlantic Ocean. The sheepshead is an important species to recreational and commercial fisheries.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Archosargus probatocephalus\" was first formally described as \"Sparus probatocephalus\" by the German physician, naturalist and taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum with no type locality given, although it is thought to be New York. The Southern sheepshead (\"A. aries\") is regarded as a separate valid species by some authorities, but is not recognised as such by FishBase. The genus \"Archosargus\" is placed in the family Sparidae within the order Spariformes by the 5th edition of \"Fishes of the World\". Some authorities classify this genus in the subfamily Sparinae, but the 5th edition of Fishes of the World does not recognise subfamilies within the Sparidae.\nEtymology.\n\"Archosargus probatocephalus\" has a specific name which compounds \"probaton\", meaning \"sheep\", with \"cephalus\". This means \"head\", reflecting its common name, sheepshead, which it was probably given because of some sheep-like features, such as having large teeth protruding from an open mouth.\nDescription.\n\"Archosargus probatocephalus\" has an oval shaped, deep, laterally compressed body with a small blunt head, the dorsal and ventral profiles of the head being convex. It has moderately sized eyes, a small horizontal mouth and the preorbital bone overlaps the rear of the maxilla. The teeth at the front of the jaw are broad and flattened, the upper jaw has three rows of molar-like teeth at the sides. The margin of the preoperculum is smooth, with no serrations or spines. The dorsal fin is long and not high and is supported by 12 spines, the front spine points towards the front and may be embedded, and 11 soft rays. The anal fin contains three spines, the second spine being very robust, and 9 or 10 soft rays. The pectoral fin is long, clearly greater in length than the pelvic fins, extending to the level of the middle spine of the anal fin. The caudal fin is forked. The adults are silvery to greenish-yellow with olive on the upper body. Along the flanks there are five or six dark vertical bars, which fade with age. The caudal and pectoral fins are greenish in colour while the dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins are dark. The sheepshead reaches a maximum published total length of , although is more typical.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Archosargus probatocephalus\" is found in the Western Atlantic Ocean where it ranges from Nova Scotia to Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It mainly occurs in coastal waters in the vicinity of rock pilings, jetties, mangrove roots, and piers, also in tidal creeks. It is euryhaline and shows a preference for brackish waters. It looks for warmer spots around springs and discharges of rivers and will occasionally enter freshwater in the winter.\nBiology.\n\"Archosargus probatocephalus\" is an omnivore, the larger juveniles and adults are predators of blue crab (\"Callinectes sapidus\"), oysters, clams, crustaceans, and small fish with young Atlantic croakers (\"Micropogonias undulatus\") The large flattened teeth are used to crush prey protected by shells or armor as well as to scrape barnacles off rocks and pilings. Juveniles feed on zooplankton, polychaetes, and chironomid larvae.\nPopulations of this fish in the Atlantic waters off the southern United States spawn mainly in the early spring. However, pelagic larvae have been observed in late winter and spring in the Gulf of Mexico. Adults move further offshore to spawn, going back to coastal waters and estuaries. The juveniles are most numerous in seagrass beds and over mud substrates, and once they grow to a length of around , they leave the seagrass beds and aggregate with the adults.\nFishing.\n\"Archosargus probatocephalus\" feeds on bivalves and crustaceans, so successful baits include shrimp, sand fleas (mole crabs), clams, fiddler crabs, and mussels. https:// have a habit of stealing bait, so a small hook is necessary. Locating sheepshead with a boat is not difficult: fishermen look for rocky bottoms or places with obstructions, jetties, and the pilings of bridges and piers. The average weight of a sheepshead is , but some individuals reach the range of . This species was subjected to overfishing in the past, and is again becoming more important to commercial fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico as more desirable species, such as red drum (\"Sciaenops ocellatus\"), decrease through overfishing.\nParasites.\nAs with other fish, the sheepshead has a variety of parasites. One of them is the monogenean \"Microcotyle archosargi\", which is parasitic on its gills.\nSheepshead Bay.\nSheepshead Bay in Brooklyn was so named, after the sheepshead was found in the waters of the bay.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Erected in 1776, Fort Montgomery was one of the first major investments by the Americans in strategic construction projects.\nDeclared a National Historic Landmark, it is part of the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area, owned and operated by the state of New York as the Fort Montgomery State Historic Site.\nBackground.\nThe strategic importance of the ability to control navigation along the Hudson River was obvious to both the Americans and the British from the outbreak of open hostilities. The Hudson was the major means for transportation of supplies and troops throughout a large portion of the northeast. The fort was constructed at a site noted as early as the seventeenth century for its strategic advantage in controlling navigation along the river.\nA month after the first open armed conflict in Lexington, the Continental Congress resolved on May 25, 1775 to build fortifications in the Hudson highlands for the purpose of preventing the British from gaining control of the river and dividing the colonies. It noted that \"\u2026a post be also taken in the Highlands on each side of Hudson\u2019s River and batteries erected in such a manner as will most effectually prevent any vessels passing that may be sent to harass the inhabitants on the borders of said river\u2026\"\nFort Constitution.\nJames Clinton and Christopher Tappan, both lifetime residents of the area, were sent to scout appropriate locations. The initial site chosen was further to the north, on Martlaer's Island, across from West Point. Plans for the fort called for four bastions. Construction of the fortifications began in the summer of 1775. By November it had 70 cannons. However, difficulties in construction and management of the original plan of fortifications, together with escalating costs, led to abandonment of that project. The site on the north side of Popolopen Creek across from Anthony's Nose was proposed, and in January 1776, the materials and resources from Fort Constitution were redirected to the construction at the new site. Construction began on the new Fort Montgomery in March 1776.\nFort Montgomery.\nFort Montgomery was located at the confluence of Popolopen Creek with the Hudson River near Bear Mountain in Orange County, New York. The fortifications included a river battery of six 32-pound cannons, a cable chain supported by a boom across the Hudson River (see Hudson River Chain), and landward redoubts connected by ramparts, all situated on a cliff promontory rising 100 feet (30 m) above the river. The fort was commanded by General George Clinton, also the newly appointed Patriot governor of the State. Fort Montgomery and its companion fortification, the smaller Fort Clinton, on the southern bank of the Popolopen, held a combined garrison of roughly 700 Colonial soldiers. These men were from the 5th NY Regiment, Lamb's Artillery, Orange County Militia, and Ulster County Militia.\nThe strategic importance of the opposite bank of Popolopen Creek was quickly realized, as it was an elevated cliff terrace with a full view of the Fort Montgomery site and could not be left undefended. These two forts and their associated cannon batteries effectively controlled this stretch of the Hudson River. The Army also conceived a major engineering project to effectively blockade any naval traffic headed north on the river. In 1776 a chain and boom were built across the river to provide a physical barrier to ships, in addition to the combined firepower of the fortifications, which could be massed against ships.\nIn July 1776, the New York convention appointed a committee, including John Jay, Robert Livingston, George Clinton and Robert Yates, to \"devise and carry into execution\" measures for \"obstructing the channel of Hudson's river, or annoying the navigation of the said River.\" Worried about lack of arms, the committee worked to buy more cannons.\nBattle of Fort Montgomery.\nOn October 6, 1777, a combined force of roughly 2,100 Loyalists, Hessians, and British regulars led by Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton attacked forts Montgomery and Clinton from the landward side (where the defenses were only partially completed). They had support from cannon fire from British ships on the Hudson River that had passed through the chevaux de frise on the lower river. The land columns attacking from west of the fort consisted of the New York Volunteers, the Loyal American Regiment, Emmerich's Chasseurs, the 57th and the 52nd Regiments of Foot. By the end of the day, both forts had fallen to the British, who burned the forts and tore down the stonework buildings.\nThe battle was strategically barren for the British, however. Their campaign against the forts caused delays in reinforcing General John Burgoyne at Saratoga. Americans gained the upper hand at the Battle of Bemis Heights and forced the surrender of Burgoyne ten days later at the Battle of Saratoga, when the reinforcements were still far to the south.\nHistoric Site.\nThe site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972. A system of trails and interpretive signs guides visitors through the ruins of the fort.\nDesigned by the architect Salvatore Cuciti, the Visitor Center opened in October 2006. The timber frame building is oriented to provide visitors with a \"gun sight\" view down the Hudson. Operated as a state museum, it contains artifacts from the site, mannequins representing military units and a detailed model of the fort.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In recent history, the term has been used to refer to anxiety-related conditions more generally.\nThe term \"neurosis\" is no longer used in psychological disorder names or categories by the World Health Organization's \"International Classification of Diseases\" (ICD) or the American Psychiatric Association's \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM). According to the \"American Heritage Medical Dictionary\" of 2007, the term is \"no longer used in psychiatric diagnosis\".\nNeurosis is distinguished from \"psychosis\", which refers to a loss of touch with reality. Its descendant term, \"neuroticism\", refers to a personality trait of being prone to anxiousness and mental collapse. The term \"neuroticism\" is also no longer used for DSM or ICD conditions; however, it is a common name for one of the Big Five personality traits. A similar concept is included in the ICD-11 as the condition \"negative affectivity\".\nHistory.\nA broad condition (1769\u20131879).\nThe term \"neurosis\" was coined by Scottish doctor William Cullen to refer to \"disorders of sense and motion\" caused by a \"general affection of the nervous system\". The term is derived from the Greek word \"neuron\" (\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, 'nerve') and the suffix \"-osis\" (-\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, 'diseased' or 'abnormal condition'). It was first used in print in Cullen's \"System of Nosology\", first published in Latin in 1769.\nCullen used the term to describe various nervous disorders and symptoms that could not be explained physiologically. Physical features, however, were almost inevitably present, and physical diagnostic tests, such as exaggerated knee-jerks, loss of the gag reflex and dermatographia, were used into the 20th century.\nFrench psychiatrist Phillipe Pinnel's \"Nosographie philosophique ou La m\u00e9thode de l'analyse appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00e9decine\" (1798) was greatly inspired by Cullen. It divided medical conditions into five categories, with one being \"neurosis\". This was divided into four basic types of mental disorder: melancholia, mania, dementia, and idiotism.\nMorphine was first isolated from opium in 1805, by German chemist Friedrich Sert\u00fcrner. After the publication of his third paper on the topic in 1817, morphine became more widely known, and used to treat neuroses and other kinds of mental distress. After becoming addicted to this highly addictive substance, he warned \"I consider it my duty to attract attention to the terrible effects of this new substance I called morphium in order that calamity may be averted.\"\nGerman psychologist Johann Friedrich Herbart used the term repression in 1824, in a discussion of unconscious ideas competing to get into consciousness.\nThe tranquilising properties of potassium bromide were noted publicly by British doctor Charles Locock in 1857. Over the coming decades, this and other bromides were used in great quantities to calm people with neuroses. This led to many cases of bromism.\nAmerican doctor Weir Mitchell first published an account of his rest cure for non-psychotic mental disorders in 1875. His 1877 book \"Fat and Blood: and how to make them\" gave a fuller explanation. The cure originally involved women being isolated in bed, only communicating with a nurse trained to talk about unchallenging topics, a fattening diet of milk, plus massage and the application of electricity. Eventually, the cure advocated by the Mitchell family had less strict isolation and diet, and was followed by men as well as women. \"Fat and Blood\" was revised and reprinted for many decades.\nBreuer, Freud and contemporaries (1880-1939).\nAustrian psychiatrist Josef Breuer first used psychoanalysis to treat hysteria in 1880\u20131882. Bertha Pappenheim was treated for a variety of symptoms that began when her father suddenly fell seriously ill in mid-1880 during a family holiday in Ischl. His illness was a turning point in her life. While sitting up at night at his sickbed she was suddenly tormented by hallucinations and a state of anxiety. At first the family did not react to these symptoms, but in November 1880, Breuer, a friend of the family, began to treat her. He encouraged her, sometimes under light hypnosis, to narrate stories, which led to partial improvement of the clinical picture, although her overall condition continued to deteriorate.\nAccording to Breuer, the slow and laborious progress of her \"remembering work\" in which she recalled individual symptoms after they had occurred, thus \"dissolving\" them, came to a conclusion on 7 June 1882 after she had reconstructed the first night of hallucinations in Ischl. \"She has fully recovered since that time\" were the words with which Breuer concluded his case report. Accounts differ on the success of Pappenheim's treatment by Breuer. She did not speak about this episode in her later life, and vehemently opposed any attempts at psychoanalytic treatment of people in her care. Breuer was not quick to publish about this case.\nThe term \"psychoneurosis\" was coined by Scottish psychiatrist Thomas Clouston for his 1883 book \"Clinical Lectures on Mental Diseases\". He describes a condition that covers what is today considered the schizophrenia and autism spectrums (a combination of symptoms that would soon become better known as dementia praecox).\nFrench neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot came to believe that psychological trauma was a cause of some cases of hysteria. He wrote in his book \"Le\u00e7ons sur les maladies du syst\u00e8me nerveux\", (1885-1887) (and published in English as \"Clinical Lectures on the Diseases of the Nervous System):\"Quite recently male hysteria has been studied by Messrs. Putnam [1884] and Walton [1883] in America, principally as it occurs after injuries, and especially after railway accidents. They have recognised, like Mr. Page, [1885] who in England has also paid attention to this subject, that many of those nervous accidents described under the name of Railway-spine, and which according to them would be better described as Railway-brain, are in fact, whether occurring in man or woman, simply manifestations of hysteria.Charcot documented around two dozen cases where psychological trauma appears to have caused hysteria. In some cases, the results are described like the modern concept of PTSD.\nAustrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud was a student of Charcot in 1885\u20136. In 1893 Freud credited Charcot with being the source of \"all the modern advances made in the understanding and knowledge of hysteria.\"\nFrench psychiatrist Pierre Janet released his book \"L'automatisme psychologique\" (Psychological automatism) in 1889, its third chapter detailing his understanding of hypnosis and the unconscious. At this time, he claimed that the main aspect of psychological trauma is dissociation (a disconnection of the conscious mind from reality). (Freud would later claim Janet as a major influence.)\nIn 1891, Thomas Clouston published \"Neuroses of Development\", which covered a wide range of physical and mental developmental conditions.Breuer came to mentor Freud. The pair released the paper \"Ueber den psychischen Mechanismus hysterischer Ph\u00e4nomene. (Vorl\u00e4ufige Mittheilung.)\" (known in English as \"On the physical mechanism of hysterical phenomena: preliminary communication\") in January 1893. It opens with:A chance observation has led us, over a number of years, to investigate a great variety of different forms and symptoms of hysteria, with a view to discovering their precipitating cause the event which provoked the first occurrence, often many years earlier, of the phenomenon in question. In the great majority of cases it is not possible to establish the point of origin by a simple interrogation of the patient, however thoroughly it may be carried out. This is in part because what is in question is often some experience which the patient dislikes discussing; but principally because he is genuinely unable to recollect it and often has no suspicion of the causal connection between the precipitating event and the pathological phenomenon. As a rule it is necessary to hypnotize the patient and to arouse his memories under hypnosis of the time at which the symptom made its first appearance; when this has been done, it becomes possible to demonstrate the connection in the clearest and most convincing fashion...\nIt is of course obvious that in cases of 'traumatic' hysteria what provokes the symptoms is the accident. The causal connection is equally evident in hysterical attacks when it is possible to gather from the patient's utterances that in each attack he is hallucinating the same event which provoked the first one. The situation is more obscure in the case of other phenomena.\nOur experiences have shown us, however, that the most various symptoms, which are ostensibly spontaneous and, as one might say, idiopathic products of hysteria, are just as strictly related to the precipitating trauma as the phenomena to which we have just alluded and which exhibit the connection quite clearly.This paper was reprinted and supplemented with case studies in the pair's 1895 book \"Studien \u00fcber Hysterie\" (Studies on Hysteria\").\" Of the book's five case studies, the most famous became that of Breuer's patient Bertha Pappenheim (given the pseudonym \"Anna O.\"). This book established the field of psychoanalysis.\nFrench neurologist Paul Oulmont was mentored by Charcot. In his 1894 book \"Th\u00e9rapeutique des n\u00e9vroses\" (Therapy of neuroses), he lists the neuroses as being hysteria, neurasthenia, exophthalmic goitre, epilepsy, migraine, Sydenham's chorea, Parkinson's disease and tetany.\nThe fifth edition of German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin's popular psychiatry textbook in 1896 gave \"neuroses\" a well-accepted definition:In the following presentation we want to summarize a group of disease states as general neuroses, which are accompanied by more or less pronounced nervous dysfunctions. What is common to these manifestations of insanity is that we are constantly dealing with the morbid processing of vital stimuli; what they also have in common is the occurrence of more transitory, peculiar manifestations of illness, sometimes in the physical, sometimes in the psychic area. These attacks of fluctuations in mental balance are therefore not independent illnesses, but only the occasional increase in a persistent illness...\nIt seems useful to me, for the time being, to distinguish between two main forms of general neuroses, epileptic and hysterical insanity.Pierre Janet published the two volume work \"N\u00e9vroses et Id\u00e9es Fixes\" (Neuroses and Fixations) in 1898. According to Janet, neuroses could be usefully divided into hysterias and psychasthenias. Hysterias induced such symptoms as anaesthesia, visual field narrowing, paralyses, and unconscious acts. Psychasthenias involved the ability to adjust to one's surroundings, similar to the later concepts of adjustment disorder and executive functions.\nJanet founded the French \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de psychologie\" in 1901. This later became the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de psychologie\", and continues today as France's main psychology body.\nBarbiturates are a class of highly addictive sedative drugs. The first barbiturate, barbital, was synthesized in 1902 by German chemists Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering and was first marketed as \"Veronal\" in 1904. The similar barbiturate phenobarbital was brought to market in 1912 under the name \"Luminal\". Barbiturates became popular drugs in many countries to reduce neurotic anxiety and displaced the use of bromides.\nJanet published the book \"Les Obsessions et la Psychasth\u00e9nie\" (The Obsessions and the Psychasthenias) in 1903. Janet followed this with the books \"The Major Symptoms of Hysteria\" in 1907, and \"Les N\u00e9vroses\" (The Neuroses) in 1909.\nAccording to Janet, one cause of neurosis is when the mental force of a traumatic event is stronger than what someone can counter using their normal coping mechanisms.\nThe Swiss psychiatrist Paul Charles Dubois published the book \"Les psychon\u00e9vroses et leur traitement moral\" in 1904, which was translated into English as \"Psychic Treatment of Nervous Disorders (The Psychoneuroses and Their Moral Treatment)\" in 1905. Dubois believed that neurosis could be successfully treated by listening carefully to patients, and rationally convincing them of the truth \u2014 what he called \"rational psychotherapy\". This was a form of cognitive behavioural therapy. He also followed Weir Mitchell's rest cure, though with a broad fattening diet and other modifications.\nMeanwhile, Freud developed a number of different theories of neurosis. The most impactful one was that it referred to mental disorders caused by the brain's defence against past psychological trauma. This redefined the general understanding and use of the word. It came to replace the concept of \"hysteria\".\nHe held the First Congress for Freudian Psychology in Salzburg in April 1908. Subsequent Congresses continue today.\nProgressive muscle relaxation (PMR) was first developed by American psychiatrist and physiologist Edmund Jacobson. This began at Harvard University in 1908. PMR involves learning to relieve the tension in specific muscle groups by first tensing and then relaxing each muscle group. When the muscle tension is released, attention is directed towards the differences felt during tension and relaxation so that the patient learns to recognize the contrast between the states. This reduces anxiety and the effect of phobias.\nFreud published the detailed case study \"Bemerkungen \u00fcber einen Fall von Zwangsneurose\" (Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis) in 1909, documenting his treatment of \"Rat Man\".\nFreud established the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) in March 1910. He arranged for Carl Jung to be its first president. This organisation chose to only provide both psychoanalytic training and recognition to medical doctors.\nThe American Psychoanalytic Association was founded in 1911 by Welsh neurologist Ernest Jones, with the support of Freud. It followed the IPA's practice of only supporting psychoanalysis provided by medical doctors.\nJung gave a speech explaining his understanding of Freud's work called \"Psychoanalysis and Neurosis\" in New York in 1912. It was published in 1916.\nThe journal \"Internationale Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse\" was established in 1913, and continued until 1941.\nThe battlefield stresses of World War I (1914\u201318) lead to many cases of strong short-term psychological symptoms, known today as \"combat stress reaction\" (CSR). Other terms for the condition include \"combat fatigue\", \"battle fatigue\", \"battle neurosis\", \"shell shock\" and \"operational stress reaction\". The general psychological term acute stress disorder was first used for this condition at this time.\nThe fight-or-flight response was first described by American physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon in 1915.\nAmerican military psychiatrist Thomas W. Salmon (the chief consultant in psychiatry in the American Expeditionary Force) released the book \"The care and treatment of mental diseases and war neuroses (\"shell shock\") in the British army\" in 1917, dealing primarily with what was considered was the best treatment for hysteria. His recommendations were broadly adopted in the US armed forces.\nFreud's most explanatory work on neurosis was his lectures later grouped together as \"General Theory of the Neuroses\" (1916\u201317), forming part 3 of the book \"Vorlesungen zur Einf\u00fchrung in die Psychoanalyse\" (1917), later published in English as \"A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis\" (1920).\nIn that work, Freud noted that:The meaning of neurotic symptoms was first discovered by J. Breuer in the study and felicitous cure of a case of hysteria which has since become famous (1880\u201382). It is true that P. Janet independently reached the same result...\nThe [neurotic] symptom develops as a substitution for something else that has remained suppressed. Certain psychological experiences should normally have become so far elaborated that consciousness would have attained knowledge of them. This did not take place, however, but out of these interrupted and disturbed processes, imprisoned in the unconscious, the symptom arose...\nOur therapy does its work by means of changing the unconscious into the conscious, and is effective only in so far as it has the opportunity of bringing about this transformation...Freud added to this with his paper \"Aus der Geschichte einer infantilen Neurose\" (From the History of an Infantile Neurosis) published in 1918, which is a detailed case study of his treatment of the \"Wolfman\".\nThe International Journal of Psychoanalysis was founded by Ernest Jones in 1920.\nIn response to stress injuries from World War I, the British government produced the \"Report of the War Office Committee of Inquiry into \"Shell-Shock\"\", which was published in 1922.\nIts recommended course of treatment included: While recognizing that each individual case of war neurosis must be treated on its merits, the Committee are of opinion that good results will be obtained in the majority by the simplest forms of psycho-therapy, i.e., explanation, persuasion and suggestion, aided by such physical methods as baths, electricity and massage. Rest of mind and body is essential in all cases. [The practices of Paul Charles Dubois.]\nThe committee are of opinion that the production of deep hypnotic sleep, while beneficial as a means of conveying suggestions or eliciting forgotten experiences are useful in selected cases, but in the majority they are unnecessary and may even aggravate the symptoms for a time.\nThey do not recommend psycho-analysis in the Freudian sense.\nIn the state of convalescence, re-education and suitable occupation of an interesting nature are of great importance. If the patient is unfit for further military service, it is considered that every endeavor should be made to obtain for him suitable employment on his return to active life.\"The common neuroses and their treatment by psychotherapy\" was a book released by British psychiatrist Thomas Arthur Ross in 1923, to instruct medical doctors in general. (A second edition was published in 1937, which was subsequently reprinted many times). He also followed the practice of Paul Charles Dubois, and believed \"Freudian analysis\" was only necessary for the most difficult cases. Ross would later write the books \"Introduction to analytical psychotherapy\" (1932) and \"An enquiry into prognosis in the neuroses\" (1936).\nIn April 1923 Freud published his monograph \"Das Ich und das Es\" (published in English as \"The Ego and the Id),\" which included a revised theory of mental functioning, now considering that repression was only one of many defence mechanisms, and that it occurred to reduce anxiety. Hence, Freud characterised repression as both a cause and a result of anxiety.\nAustrian literary theorist Otto Rank was a close ally of Freud. His book \"The\" \"Trauma of Birth\" (1924) focused more on people's choices, rather than Freud's focus on drives. He believed in the idea of psychotherapy as opposed to psychoanalysis \u2014 that understanding someone's neuroses wasn't sufficient for effective therapy.\nFreud released his book \"Hemmung, Symptom und Angst\" (Inhibition, Symptom and Anxiety) in 1926, in reaction to Rank's book. It detailed his further developed understanding of neurosis and anxiety. (The book was published in English as \"The Problem of Anxiety\" in 1936.) This book expressed his new view that anxiety created repression, rather than the other way around. \nFreud also published the book \"Die Frage der Laienanalyse\" (The Question of Lay Analysis) in 1926, in which he endorsed non-doctors performing psychoanalysis. \nIn 1929, Austrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler published the book \"Problems of Neurosis: A Book of Case-Histories\", furthering the school of individual psychology he had established in 1912.\n1929 also saw Edmund Jacobson publishing of the professional instruction book \"Progressive Relaxation\". It explained the benefits of relaxation for addressing neuroses and other mental conditions. He followed this with the more publicly-oriented \"You Must Relax\" in 1934.\nWalter Bradford Cannon's 1932 book \"The Wisdom of the Body\" popularised the concept of fight-or-flight.\nThe American Medical Association released its \"Standard Classified Nomenclature of Diseases\" in 1933, the first widely accepted such nomenclature in the United States. By the second edition of 1935, its category of \"psychoneuroses\" included:\nThe general adaptation syndrome (GAS) theory of stress was developed by Austro-Hungarian physiologist Hans Selye in 1936.\nIn 1937, Austrian-American psychiatrist Adolph Stern proposed that there were many people with conditions that fitted between the definitions of psychoneurosis and psychosis, and called them the \"border line group of neuroses\". This group would later become known as borderline personality disorder.\nBy 1937, the concept of \"occupational neuroses\" was known by many American health practitioners. It referred to neuroses caused by any aspect of someone's employment.\n1939\u20131952.\nFollowers of Freud's psychoanalytic thinking, such as Carl Jung, Karen Horney, and Jacques Lacan, continued to discuss the concept of neurosis after Freud's death in 1939. The term continues to be used in the Freudian sense in psychology and philosophy.\nBy 1939, some 120,000 British ex-servicemen had received final awards for primary psychiatric disability or were still drawing pensions\u00a0\u2013 about 15% of all pensioned disabilities\u00a0\u2013 and another 44,000 or so were getting pensions for \"soldier's heart\" or effort syndrome. British historian Ben Shephard notes, \"There is, though, much that statistics do not show, because in terms of psychiatric effects, pensioners were just the tip of a huge iceberg.\"\nApproximately 20% of U.S. troops displayed symptoms of combat stress reaction during WWII (1939-1945). It was assumed to be a temporary response of healthy individuals to witnessing or experiencing traumatic events. Symptoms included depression, anxiety, withdrawal, confusion, paranoia, and sympathetic hyperactivity. Thomas W. Salmon's battle neurosis principles were adopted by the U.S. forces during this conflict.\nThe American Journal of Psychoanalysis was founded by Karen Horney in 1941.\n1942 saw American psychologist Carl Rogers publish the handbook \"Counseling and Psychotherapy\", which established his school of person-centered therapy.\nAustrian psychiatrist Otto Fenichel's encyclopaedic textbook \"The psychoanalytic theory of neurosis\" (1945) set the post-war Freudian orthodoxy on the subject. It has been heavily cited by academic papers in the years since.\nKaren Horney's \"Our Inner Conflicts: A Constructive Theory of Neurosis\" (1945) was a popular book on the topic.\nThe post-World War II boom in the number of patient-treating psychologists in the United States led to a major restructure of the American Psychological Association in 1945. Carl Rogers became its president in 1947.\nAustrian psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's best selling book \"Man's Search for Meaning\" (1946) launched the psychotherapy school of logotherapy.\nFor his 1947 book, \"Dimensions of Personality\", German-British psychologist Hans Eysenck created the term \"neuroticism\" to refer to someone whose \"constitution may leave them liable to break down [emotionally] with the slightest provocation\". The book outlines a two-factor theory of personality, with neuroticism as one of those two factors. This book would be greatly influential on future personality theory.\nKaren Horney's \"Neurosis and Human Growth\" (1950) further expanded the understanding of neuroses.\nFrench-Swiss psychologist Germaine Guex's 1950 book \"La n\u00e9vrose d'abandon\" proposed the existence of the condition of \"abandonment neurosis\". It also detailed all the forms of treatment Geux had found effective in treating it. (It was published in English as \"The Abandonment Neurosis\" in 2015).\nIn October 1951, the now highly influential Carl Rogers presented a paper in which he described the relationship between neurosis and his understanding of effective therapy. He wrote:The emotionally maladjusted person, the \"neurotic\", is in difficulty first because communication within himself has broken down, and second because as a result of this his communication with others has been damaged. If this sounds somewhat strange, then let me put it in other terms. In the \"neurotic\" individual, parts of himself which have been termed unconscious, or repressed, or denied to awareness, become blocked off so that they no longer communicate themselves to the conscious or managing part of himself... The task of psychotherapy is to help the person achieve, through a special relationship with the therapist, good communication within himself.The North American Society of Adlerian Psychology was established in 1952, becoming the predominant society of its cause in the world.\nDSM-I (1952\u20131968).\nThe first edition of the American Psychiatric Association's \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-I) in 1952 included a category named \"Psychoneurotic Disorders\".\nRegarding the definition of this category, the Manual stated:Grouped as Psychoneurotic Disorders are those disturbances in which \"anxiety\" is a chief characteristic, directly felt and expressed, or automatically controlled by such defenses as depression, conversion, dissociation, displacement, phobia formation, or repetitive thoughts and acts.\nFor this nomenclature, a psychoneurotic reaction may be defined as one in which the personality, in its struggle for adjustment to internal and external stresses, utilizes the mechanisms listed above to handle the anxiety created. The qualifying phrase, x.2 with neurotic reaction, may be used to amplify the diagnosis when, in the presence of another psychiatric disturbance, a symptomatic clinical picture appears which might be diagnosed under Psychoneurotic Disorders in this nomenclature. A specific example may be seen in an episode of acute anxiety occurring in a homosexual.Conditions in the category included:\nThe DSM-I also included a category of \"transient situational personality disorders\". This included the diagnosis of \"gross stress reaction\". This was defined as a normal personality using established patterns of reaction to deal with overwhelming fear as a response to conditions of great stress. The diagnosis included language which relates the condition to combat as well as to \"civilian catastrophe\". The other situational disorders were \"adult situational reaction\" and a variety of time-of-life delineated \"adjustment reactions\". These referred to short-term reactions to stressors.\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were developed for the treatment of neurosis and other conditions from the early 1950s. Because of their undesirable adverse-effect profile and high potential for toxicity, their use was limited.\nThe use of modern exposure therapy for neuroses began in the 1950s in South Africa. South African-American Joseph Wolpe was one of the first psychiatrists to spark interest in treating psychiatric problems as behavioral issues.\nIn May 1950, pharmacologist Frank Berger (Czech-American) and chemist Bernard John Ludwig engineered meprobamate to be a non-drowsy tranquiliser. Launched as \"Miltown\" in 1955, it rapidly became the first blockbuster psychotropic drug in American history, becoming popular in Hollywood and gaining fame for its effects. It is highly addictive.\n\"The Meaning of Anxiety\" was a book released by American psychiatrist Rollo May in 1950. It reviewed the existing research on the subject. It found that some anxiety was a simple reaction to related stimuli, while other anxiety had a more complicated and neurotic beginning. A revised edition of the book was published in 1977.\nAfter the Korean War (1950-1953), Thomas W. Salmon's battle neurosis treatment practices became summarised as the PIE principles:\nThe Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale was created by American psychologist Janet Taylor in 1953. It measures anxiousness as a personality trait.\nThe International Association of Analytical Psychology was founded in 1955. It is the predominant organisation devoted to the psychology of Carl Jung.\nThe American Academy of Psychoanalysis was founded in 1956, for psychiatrists to discuss psychoanalysis in ways that deviated from the orthodoxy of the time.\nAlso in 1956, American psychologist Albert Ellis publicly read his first paper on his methodology \"rational psychotherapy\"\".\" (He took inspiration from, and used the same name as the methodology of Paul Charles Dubois. He claimed additional inspiration from Freud and Epicetus). This and later works defined what is now known as rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). Ellis believed that people's erroneous beliefs about their adversities was a major cause of neurosis, and his therapy aimed to dissolve these neuroses by correcting people's understandings. Ellis published the first REBT book, \"How to live with a neurotic,\" in 1957. \nAlbert Ellis and others founded \"The Institute for Rational Living\" in April 1959, which later became the Albert Ellis Institute.\nThe concept of \"institutional neurosis\" was coined by British psychiatrist Russell Barton, and explained in his well-cited 1959 book \"Institutional Neurosis\". Barton believed that many of the mental health symptoms had by people living in mental hospitals and similar institutions were caused by being in those environments, rather than other causes. Barton was a leader in the deinstitutionalisation movement. (This form of neurosis later came to be known as \"institutional syndrome\").\nBenzodiazepines are a class of highly addictive sedative drugs that reduce anxiety by depressing function in certain parts of the brain. The first of these drugs, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was made available for sale in 1960. (It was discovered by Polish-American chemist Leo Sternbach in 1955.) Librium was followed with the more popular diazepam (Valium) in 1963. These drugs soon displaced Miltown.\nSpanish history writer Jose M. Lopez Pinero published \"Origenes historicos del concepto de neurosis\" in 1963. It was published in English as \"Historical Origins of the Concept of Neurosis\" in 1983.\nNeurotics Anonymous began in February 1964, as a twelve-step program to help the neurotic. It was founded in Washington, D.C. by American psychologist Grover Boydston, and has since spread through the Americas.\nAlso in 1964, Polish psychiatrist Kazimierz D\u0105browski released his book \"Positive Disintegration\". The book argues that developing and resolving psychoneurosis is a necessary part of healthy personality development.\nThe year 1964 also saw the establishment of the American Psychological Association's Division 25, a group of psychologists interested in behaviourism.\nThe popular textbook \"The causes and cures of neurosis; an introduction to modern behaviour therapy based on learning theory and the principles of conditioning\" was published in 1965 by Hans Eysenck and South African-British psychologist Stanley Rachman. It aimed to replace the Freudian approach to neurosis with behaviorism.\nThe \"Hopkins Symptom Checklist\" (HSCL) is a self-report symptom inventory that was developed in the mid-1960s from earlier checklists. It measures somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety and depression.\nIn 1966, psychologists began to observe large numbers of children of Holocaust survivors seeking mental help in clinics in Canada. The grandchildren of Holocaust survivors were overrepresented by 300% among the referrals to psychiatry clinics in comparison with their representation in the general population. Further study lead to the better understanding of transgenerational trauma.\nThe noted book \"Psychological stress and the coping process\" was released by American psychologist Richard Lazarus in 1966.\nThe well-cited book \"Anxiety and Behaviour\" was also released in 1966. As with Eysenck and Rachman's book, it aimed to connect neuroses with behaviourism. It was edited by American psychologist Charles Spielberger.\nThe Association for Advancement of Behavioral Therapies was founded in 1966. (In 2005, it became the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.)\nDSM-II (1968\u20131980).\nAfter Freudian thinking became less prominent in psychology, the term \"neurosis\" came to be used as a near synonym for \"anxiety\". The second edition of the DSM (\"DSM-II\") in 1968 described neuroses thusly: Anxiety is the chief characteristic of the neuroses. It may be felt and expressed directly, or it may be controlled unconsciously and automatically by conversion [into physical symptoms], displacement [into mental symptoms] and various other psychological mechanisms. Generally, these mechanisms produce symptoms experienced as subjective distress from which the patient desires relief. The neuroses, as contrasted to the psychoses, manifest neither gross distortion or misinterpretation of external reality, nor gross personality disorganization...Included in this category were the conditions:\nWhat was previously \"gross stress reaction\" and \"adult situational reaction\" was combined into the new \"adjustment disorder of adult life\", a condition covering mild to strong reactions. Other adjustment disorders for other times-of-life were also included. (Also, the category \"transient situational personality disorders\" was renamed \"transient situational disturbances.\")\n\"Anxiety and Neurosis\" was a popular mass-market book released in 1968 by British psychologist Charles Rycroft.\n\"Neuroses and Personality Disorders\" was a popular textbook released by American psychologist Elton B McNeil in 1970.\nThe State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was developed by Charles Spielberger and others, and first published in 1970. It provides separate \"state\" and \"trait\" measures of a person's anxiety. A revised form was released in 1983.\nThe book \"Primal Scream. Primal Therapy: The Cure for Neurosis\" by American psychologist Arthur Janov was released in 1970. It established primal therapy as a treatment for neurosis. It is based on the idea that neurosis is caused by the repressed pain of childhood trauma. Janov argued that repressed pain can be sequentially brought to conscious awareness for resolution through re-experiencing specific incidents and fully expressing the resulting pain during therapy. Janov criticizes the talking therapies as they deal primarily with the cerebral cortex and higher-reasoning areas and do not access the source of Pain within the more basic parts of the central nervous system. (A second edition of the book was published in 1999).\nChinese-American psychiatrist William WK Zung released his \"Anxiety Status Inventory\" (ASI) and patient \"Self-rating Anxiety Scale\" (SAS) in November 1971.\nD\u0105browski expanded on his earlier book with \"Psychoneurosis Is Not An Illness: Neuroses And Psychoneuroses From The Perspective Of Positive Disintegration\" in 1972.\n\"Anxiety: Current Trends in Theory and Research\" is a well-cited series of two books released in 1972, and were edited by Charles Spielberger.\nAmerican anthropologist Ernst Becker in his Pulitzer-winning book The Denial of Death (1973) argued that the repression of the fear of death had a number of advantages, and that this was a major source of neurosis.\nThe first tetracyclic anti-depressant (TeCA) maprotiline (Ludiomil) was developed by Ciba, and patented in 1966. It was introduced for medical use in 1974. TeCAs mianserin (Tolvon) and amoxapine (Asendin) followed shortly thereafter and mirtazapine (Remeron) being introduced later on. Albert Ellis' work was expanded on by fellow American, psychiatrist Aaron Beck. In 1975, Beck released the greatly influential book \"Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders\". Beck's cognitive therapy became popular, soon becoming the most popular form of CBT and often being known by that name.\nAmerican psychiatrist and historian Kenneth Levin's \"Freud's early psychology of the neuroses: a historical perspective\" was published in 1978.\nAmerican-Israeli medical sociologist Aaron Antonovsky in his 1979 book \"Stress, Health and Coping\", stated that an event will not be perceived as stressful when it is appraised as consistent, under some personal control of the outcome, and balanced between underload and overload. Someone resistant to stress will see potential stressors as instead being \"meaningful, predictable, and ordered.\" Antonovsky proposed that stress and a lack of an individual's \"resistance resources\" (to stressors) may be the main underlying causes of illness and disease, not just mental neuroses. This book established the field of salutogenesis.\nIn January 1980, Stanley Rachman published a well-cited working definition of \"emotional processing\", aiming to define the \"certain psychological experiences\" Freud had mentioned in his 1923 book (and had earlier referred to). It included lists of things likely to improve or retard such processing.\nDSM-III (1980\u20131994).\nThe DSM replaced its \"neurosis\" category with an \"anxiety disorders\" category in 1980, with the release of the \"DSM-III\". It did this because of a decision by its editors to provide descriptions of behavior rather than descriptions of hidden psychological mechanisms. This change was controversial.\nThis edition of the book also included a condition named \"post-traumatic stress disorder\" for the first time. This was similar in definition to the \"gross stress reaction\" of the DSM-I.\nThe anxiety disorders were defined as:\nAdjustment disorder remained, and was defined separately. Its time-of-life based subtypes were abolished, replaced with combinations with co-morbid syndromes (such as \"Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood\" and \"Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood\"). Adjustment disorder returned to being a short-term condition.\nSomatoform disorders, disassociation, depression and hypochondria (all previously considered neuroses) were also treated separately. Neurasthenia (a neurosis that caused otherwise unexplainable fatigue) was loosely mapped to a mild form of depression.\nThe American \"National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work\" was established in May 1980. (It became the \"American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work\" in 2007).\nAmerican psychiatrist George F. Drinka released the history book \"Birth of Neurosis: Myth, Malady, and the Victorians\" in 1984.\nThe World Association of Psychoanalysis was founded in January 1992, and became the largest organisation devoted to the psychotherapy of Jacques Lacan.\nDSM-5 (2013\u2013current).\nIn 2013, the DSM-5 was released, separating out the \"trauma and stress-related disorders\" (Freud's etiology for neuroses) from the \"anxiety disorders\". The former category includes:\nPrevention.\nStress inoculation training was developed to reduce anxiety in doctors during times of intense stress by Donald Meichenbaum. It is a combination of techniques including relaxation, negative thought suppression, and real-life exposure to feared situations used in PTSD treatment. The therapy is divided into four phases and is based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. The first phase identifies the individual's specific reaction to stressors and how they manifest into symptoms. The second phase helps teach techniques to regulate these symptoms using relaxation methods. The third phase deals with specific coping strategies and positive cognitions to work through the stressors. Finally, the fourth phase exposes the client to imagined and real-life situations related to the traumatic event. This training helps to shape the response to future triggers to diminish impairment in daily life.\nPatients with acute stress disorder (ASD) have been found to benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy in preventing PTSD, with clinically meaningful outcomes at six-month follow-up consultations. Supportive counseling was outperformed by a regimen of relaxation, cognitive restructuring, imaginal exposure, and in-vivo exposure. Programs based on mindfulness-based stress reduction also seem to be useful at managing stress.\nProgressive muscle relaxation (PMR) was developed by Edmund Jacobson. PMR involves learning to relieve the tension in specific muscle groups by first tensing and then relaxing each muscle group. When the muscle tension is released, attention is directed towards the differences felt during tension and relaxation so that the patient learns to recognize the contrast between the states. This reduces anxiety.\nPlaying Tetris shortly after a traumatic experience prevents the development of PTSD in some cases.\nStanley Rachman compiled lists of factors that promote or impede \"emotional processing\" in 1980, the former reducing the development of neurosis, the latter making it more likely.\nAaron Antonovsky stated that a resilient person is more likely to appraise a situation as \"meaningful, predictable, and ordered.\"\nMichael Rutter found that resilience could be improved in an individual by the 1) reduction of risk impact, 2) reduction of negative chain reactions, 3) establishment and maintenance of self-esteem and self-efficacy, and 4) opening up of opportunities.\nThe use of pharmaceuticals to mitigate the consequences of ASD has made some progress. The Alpha-1 blocker Prazosin, which controls sympathetic response, can be administered to patients to help them unwind and enable better sleep. It is unclear how it functions in this situation. Following a traumatic experience, hydrocortisone (cortisol) has demonstrated some promise as an early prophylactic intervention, frequently slowing the onset of PTSD.\nIn a systematic literature review in 2014, the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU) found that a number of work environment factors could affect the risk of developing exhaustion disorder or depressive symptoms:\nEtiology.\nHistoric versions of the DSM and ICD.\nThe term \"neurosis\" is no longer used in a professional diagnostic sense, it having been eliminated from the DSM in 1980 with the publication of DSM III, and having the last remnants of being removed from the ICD with the enacting of the ICD-11 in 2022. (In the ICD-10 it was used in section F48.8 to describe certain minor conditions.)\nAccording to the \"anxiety\" concept of the term, there were many different neuroses, including:\nAccording to C. George Boeree, professor emeritus at Shippensburg University, the symptoms of neurosis may involve:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... anxiety, sadness or depression, anger, irritability, mental confusion, low sense of self-worth, etc., behavioral symptoms such as phobic avoidance, vigilance, impulsive and compulsive acts, lethargy, etc., cognitive problems such as unpleasant or disturbing thoughts, repetition of thoughts and obsession, habitual fantasizing, negativity and cynicism, etc. Interpersonally, neurosis involves dependency, aggressiveness, perfectionism, schizoid isolation, socio-culturally inappropriate behaviors, etc.\nPsychoanalytic (Freudian) theory.\nAccording to psychoanalytic theory, neuroses may be rooted in ego defense mechanisms, though the two concepts are not synonymous. Defense mechanisms are a normal way of developing and maintaining a consistent sense of self (i.e., an \"ego\"). However, only those thoughts and behaviors that produce difficulties in one's life should be called \"neuroses\".\nA neurotic person experiences emotional distress and unconscious conflict, which are manifested in various physical or mental illnesses; the definitive symptom being anxiety. Neurotic tendencies are common and may manifest themselves as acute or chronic anxiety, depression, OCD, a phobia, or a personality disorder.\nFreud's typology of neuroses in \"Introduction to Psychoanalysis\" (1923) included:\nJungian theory.\nCarl Jung found his approach particularly effective for patients who are well adjusted by social standards but are troubled by existential questions. Jung claims to have \"frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life\". Accordingly, the majority of his patients \"consisted not of believers but of those who had lost their faith\". A contemporary person, according to Jung, ...\u00a0is blind to the fact that, with all his rationality and efficiency, he is possessed by 'powers' that are beyond his control. His gods and demons have not disappeared at all; they have merely got new names. They keep him on the run with restlessness, vague apprehensions, psychological complications, an insatiable need for pills, alcohol, tobacco, food \u2014 and, above all, a large array of neuroses.Jung found that the unconscious finds expression primarily through an individual's inferior psychological function, whether it is thinking, feeling, sensation, or intuition. The characteristic effects of a neurosis on the dominant and inferior functions are discussed in his \"Psychological Types\". Jung also found collective neuroses in politics: \"Our world is, so to speak, dissociated like a neurotic.\"\nHorney's theory.\nIn her final book, \"Neurosis and Human Growth\", Karen Horney lays out a complete theory of the origin and dynamics of neurosis. In her theory, neurosis is a distorted way of looking at the world and at oneself, which is determined by compulsive needs rather than by a genuine interest in the world as it is. Horney proposes that neurosis is transmitted to a child from their early environment and that there are many ways in which this can occur:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When summarized, they all boil down to the fact that the people in the environment are too wrapped up in their own neuroses to be able to love the child, or even to conceive of him as the particular individual he is; their attitudes toward him are determined by their own neurotic needs and responses.\nThe child's initial reality is then distorted by their parents' needs and pretenses. Growing up with neurotic caretakers, the child quickly becomes insecure and develops basic anxiety. To deal with this anxiety, the child's imagination creates an idealized self-image:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each person builds up his personal idealized image from the materials of his own special experiences, his earlier fantasies, his particular needs, and also his given faculties. If it were not for the personal character of the image, he would not attain a feeling of identity and unity. He idealizes, to begin with, his particular \"solution\" of his basic conflict: compliance becomes goodness, love, saintliness; aggressiveness becomes strength, leadership, heroism, omnipotence; aloofness becomes wisdom, self-sufficiency, independence. What\u2014according to his particular solution\u2014appear as shortcomings or flaws are always dimmed out or retouched.\nOnce they identify themselves with their idealized image, a number of effects follow. They will make claims on others and on life based on the prestige they feel entitled to because of their idealized self-image. They will impose a rigorous set of standards upon themselves in order to try to measure up to that image. They will cultivate pride, and with that will come the vulnerabilities associated with pride that lacks any foundation. Finally, they will despise themselves for all their limitations. Vicious circles will operate to strengthen all of these effects.\nEventually, as they grow to adulthood, a particular \"solution\" to all the inner conflicts and vulnerabilities will solidify. They will be either:\nIn Horney's view, mild anxiety disorders and full-blown personality disorders all fall under her basic scheme of neurosis as variations in the degree of severity and in the individual dynamics. The opposite of neurosis is a condition Horney calls \"self-realization\", a state of being in which the person responds to the world with the full depth of their spontaneous feelings, rather than with anxiety-driven compulsion. Thus, the person grows to actualize their inborn potentialities. Horney compares this process to an acorn that grows and becomes a tree: the acorn has had the potential for a tree inside it all along.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The exact geographical extent varies depending on the definition: in the narrow sense, the area constituted by three Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning as well as the eastern Inner Mongolian prefectures of Hulunbuir, Hinggan, Tongliao, and Chifeng; in a broader sense, historical Manchuria includes those regions plus the Amur river basin, parts of which were ceded to the Russian Empire by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty during the Amur Annexation of 1858\u20131860. The parts of Manchuria ceded to Russia are collectively known as Outer Manchuria or Russian Manchuria, which include present-day Amur Oblast, Primorsky Krai, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, the southern part of Khabarovsk Krai, and the eastern edge of Zabaykalsky Krai.\nThe name \"Manchuria\" is an exonym (derived from the endonym \"Manchu\") of Japanese origin. The history of \"Manchuria\" (\"Manzhou\") as a toponym in China is disputed, with some scholars believing it was never used while others believe it was by the late 19th century. The area was historically referred to by various names in the Qing dynasty such as \"Guandong\" (East of the Pass) or the \"Three Provinces\" referring to Fengtian (Liaoning), Heilongjiang, and Jilin. \"Manchuria\" as a geographical term was first used in the 18th or 19th centuries by the Japanese before spreading to Europe. The term was promoted by the Empire of Japan in support for the existence of its puppet state, Manchukuo. Although the toponym is still used, some scholars treat the term with caution or avoid it altogether due to its association with Japanese colonialism. The term is deprecated in China due to its association with Japanese imperialism and ethnic connotations. As a result, areas once considered part of Manchuria are simply referred to as the \"Northeast\". The \"Three Provinces\" and the \"Northeast\" were also in concurrent use among the Japanese along with \"Manchuria\" until the Mukden incident of 1931.\nThe area is home to many ethnic groups, including the Manchus, Mongols, Koreans, Nanai, Nivkhs, and Ulchs. Many of the early ancient Koreanic kingdoms were established in the area. It is the ancestral homeland to the Tungusic-speaking Jurchens and their descendants, the Manchus.\nBoundaries.\nManchuria is now most often associated with the three Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning. The former Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo further included the prefectures of Chengde (now in Hebei), and Hulunbuir, Hinggan, Tongliao, and Chifeng (now in Inner Mongolia). The region of the Qing dynasty referenced as Manchuria originally further included Primorskiy Kray, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, the southern parts of Amur Oblast and Khabarovskiy Kray, and a corner of Zabaykal\u02bcskiy Kray. These districts were acknowledged as Qing territory by the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk but ceded to the Russian Empire due to the Amur Annexation in the unequal 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 Convention of Beijing (the People's Republic of China indirectly questioned the legitimacy of these treaties in the 1960s, but settled border with Russia 2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship; a minor exchange nonetheless occurred in 2004 at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers). Various senses of Greater Manchuria sometimes further include Sakhalin Island, which despite its lack of mention in treaties was shown as Qing territory on period Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and French maps of the area.\nThe drainage basin of the Amur River apart to the east towards Mongolia roughly corresponds to the geographical area of the historic land of the Manchu people. The northern boundary was marked by mountains.\nNames.\nManchuria.\nOrigins.\nThe geographical term \"Manchuria\" was first used in the 18th or 19th century by the Japanese. \"Manchuria\" \u2013 variations of which arrived in European languages through Dutch \u2013 is a calque of Latin of the Japanese placename \"Mansh\u016b\" (, \"Region of the Manchus\"), which dates from the 18th century.\nAccording to the American researcher Mark C. Elliott, the term \"Mansh\u016b\" first appeared as a placename in Katsuragawa Hosh\u016b's 1794 work \"Hokusa Bunryaku\" in two maps, \"Ashia zenzu\" and \"Chiky\u016b hanky\u016b s\u014dzu\", which were also created by Katsuragawa. According to Junko Miyawaki-Okada, Japanese geographer Takahashi Kageyasu was the first to use the term \"Mansh\u016b\" as a toponym in 1809 in the \"Nippon Henkai Ryakuzu\", and it was from that work that Westerners adopted the name. By the 1830s, various Indo-European forms of \"Mansh\u016b\" could be found. However, according to Li Narangoa, the term was introduced to Japan in the 18th century through European maps following Jesuit conventions.\n\"Mansh\u016b\" then increasingly appeared on maps by Japanese cartographers such as Kondi J\u016bz\u014d, Takahashi Kageyasu, Baba Sadayoshi, and Yamada Ren. Their maps were brought to Europe by Philipp Franz von Siebold. According to Japanese scholar Nakami Tatsuo, Siebold was the one who brought the usage of the term \"Manchuria\" to Europeans after borrowing it from the Japanese, who were the first to use it in a geographic manner in the 18th century.\nChina.\nThe history of the use of \"Manchuria\" as a toponym in China is uncertain. According to one stream of thought, it was not used by the Manchus or the Chinese. The name \"Manchu\" was given to the Jurchen people by Hong Taiji in 1635 as a new name for their ethnic group. However neither the name \"Manchu\" or the Chinese rendering of \"Mansh\u016b\" as \"Manzhou\" ever acquired geographical connotations, while in Japanese, both \"Manchuria\" and \"Manchu\" are rendered as \"Mansh\u016b\". According to Nakami Tatsuo, \"Manzhou\" was used to refer to Manchu people or one of their states rather than a region: \"Originally, \"Manzhou\" was the name of the Manchu people or of their state; it was not the name of a region. In fact, neither Manchus nor Han Chinese have ever called China's Northeast 'Manzhou'.\" Even advocates of an independent Manchuria such as Inaba Iwakichi acknowledged this. In 1912, British diplomat and sinologist Herbert Giles stated in \"China and the Manchus\" that \"'Manchuria' is unknown to the Chinese or to the Manchus themselves as a geographical expression\". According to Owen Latimore, during his travels in China during the late 1920s, he found \"no single Chinese name for Manchuria as a unit\". Historical geographer Philippe For\u00eat concurred, noting that there is no word for \"Manchuria\" in either Chinese or Manchu languages.\nAnother perspective delineated by scholars such as Mark C. Elliott and Li Narangoa argues that Manchu consciousness of their homeland as a unique place contributed to the creation of Manchuria as a distinct geographical entity, and that \"Manchuria\" (\"Manzhou\") was used as a toponym by the Chinese. According to Elliott, the Manchu imperial lineage believed that their original homeland was the Changbai Mountains. The Qing court endeavored to create a regional identity focused on the Changbai Mountains, which gradually became a symbol of Manchu identity. However, it is uncertain whether that notion was shared among ordinary Manchus, and there is evidence that part of that effort was to combat widespread acculturation among Manchus, resulting in the loss of their language. As part of this effort, Jesuits were commissioned to create maps that enhanced Manchu conceptualization of their homeland, which Elliot believes to have been the original impetus to label the region as Manchuria in European and Japanese maps. In 1877, \"Manzhou\" was used as a toponym in an essay by Gong Chai, a scholar from Ningbo. The description of \"Manzhou\" located it to the northeast of Beijing and identified it as the birthplace of the dynasty. \"Manzhou\" was used as a place name again 20 years later by Qing officials. \"Manzhou\" began to appear on Chinese maps in the first decade of the 1900s. Maps that used \"Manzhou\" were in the minority during the early Republican period but the name remained in common use among the Chinese Communist Party into the 1930s. Names for the region were relatively fluid before the Mukden Incident of 1931, after which alternative names in Japanese were discarded for \"Mansh\u016b\", and \"Dongbei\" (Northeast) and \"Dongsansheng\" (Three Eastern Provinces) became the orthodox names for the Chinese. According to Mark Gamsa, \"Manzhou\" was not widely used among the Chinese but the People's Republic of China disapproved of it regardless. By the 1950s, \"Manzhou\" had virtually disappeared as a toponym although some still used it out of habit.\nJapan.\nThe term \"Manchuria\" has been described as \"controversial\" or \"troublesome\" by several scholars including Mark C. Elliott, Norman Smith, and Mariko Asano Tamanoi. The historian Norman Smith wrote that \"The term 'Manchuria' is controversial\" based on reasons outlined by Mariko Asano Tamanoi in the \"Introduction\" of \"Crossed Histories: Manchuria in the Age of Empire\" (2005). According to Tamanoi, \"'Manchuria' is a product of Japanese imperialism, and to call the area Manzhou is to accept uncritically a Japanese colonial legacy.\" Japan used the name \"Manchuria\" to convey the idea of a contested region distinct from China while China insisted on its ownership of the region by rejecting the name \"Manchuria\". Japanese colonists who returned to Japan from Manchukuo in the post-war period used terms such as \"Manshu\" (Manchuria), \"Man-m\u014d\" (Manchuria-Mongolia), and \"M\u014d-man\" (Mongolia-Manchuria) almost interchangeably. Hyphenated terms such as \"Man-s\u0113n\" (Manchuria and Korea) and \"Man-m\u014d\" (Manchuria-Mongolia) emerged in Japanese media and traveler writings during the first three decades of the 20th century, implying that these regions were extensions of each other. Tamanoi notes that the name \"Manchuria\" cannot be found on Chinese maps and acknowledged that she \"should use the term in quotation marks\" even though she did not.\nHistorian Bill Sewell denies that \"Manchuria\" is \"a genuine geographic term\", claiming the Japanese never viewed Manchuria as a discrete entity and it was Europeans who first started using the name Manchuria to refer to the location. Others such as For\u00eat described \"Manchuria\" as a solely geographical term without indicating a political connection and used it in that capacity despite acknowledging its imperialistic overtones. The historian Gavan McCormack agreed with Robert H.\u00a0G. Lee's statement that \"The term Manchuria or Man-chou is a modern creation used mainly by westerners and Japanese\", with McCormack writing that the term Manchuria is imperialistic in nature and has no \"precise meaning\" since the Japanese deliberately promoted the use of \"Manchuria\" as a geographic name to promote its separation from China at the time they were setting up their puppet state of Manchukuo. In the 1920s, Japanese media still presented Manchuria as part of China, albeit as a distinct region, and sometimes called it the \"Garden of China\". However, in 1932, the puppet state of Manchukuo was founded covering not only the northeastern three provinces but also parts of eastern Inner Mongolia. In 1933, the Bureau of Information and the Publicity Department of Foreign Affairs of the Manchukuo Government published a \"Handbook of Information of Manchukuo\" stating that Manchuria did not belong to China, had its own history and traditions, and was the home of the Manchus and Mongols. Elliot notes that one scholar considered the use of \"Manchuria\" as not only inaccurate but giving approval to Japanese colonialism.\nNurgan.\nDuring the Ming dynasty the area in which the Jurchens lived was referred to as Nurgan.\nThree Provinces.\nDuring the Qing dynasty, the region was known as the \"three eastern provinces\" (; Manchu\u1869\u185d\u1875\u1864\u1873\u1873\u182f\u1820\u1828\u1864\u1823\u182f\u1823, \"Dergi Ilan Golo\"), which referred to Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Fengtian since 1683 when Jilin and Heilongjiang were separated. However, Jilin and Heilongjiang did not receive the full function of provinces until 1907. The Japanese also used the name \"Three Eastern Provinces\" (\"T\u014dsansh\u014d\") during the 1920s and 1930s along with \"Mansh\u016b\". However, after the Manchurian Incident of 1931, \"T\u014dsansh\u014d\" was completely replaced by \"Mansh\u016b\" in Japanese usage while the \"Three Provinces\" and \"Northeast\" became the orthodox name for the same region in Chinese usage.\nGuandong.\nManchuria has been referred to as \"Guandong\" (), which literally means \"east of the pass\", and similarly \"Guanwai\" (), a reference to Shanhai Pass in Qinhuangdao in today's Hebei, at the eastern end of the Great Wall of China. This usage is seen in the expression \"Chu\u01ceng Gu\u0101nd\u014dng\" (literally \"Rushing into Guandong\") referring to the mass migration of Han Chinese to Manchuria in the 19th and 20th centuries. The name Guandong later came to be used more narrowly for the area of the Kwantung Leased Territory on the Liaodong Peninsula. It is not to be confused with the southern province of Guangdong.\nNortheast Region.\nThe term \"Manchuria\" is deprecated among people of the People's Republic of China (PRC) due to its association with Japanese imperialism, the puppet state of Manchukuo of the Empire of Japan, and Manchurian nationalism. Official state documents use the term Northeast Region (\u4e1c\u5317; D\u014dngb\u011bi) to describe the region, and an inhabitant of the Northeast is a \"Northeasterner\" (). It is usually restricted to the \"Three East Provinces\" or \"Three Northeast Provinces\", excluding northeastern Inner Mongolia. The \"Northeast\" (\"T\u014dhoku\") was also used as a name for Manchuria by the Japanese during the 1920s and 1930s.\nNortheast China is predominantly occupied by Han Chinese due to internal Chinese migrations and Sinicization of the Manchus, especially during the Qing dynasty. It is considered the original homeland of several historical groups besides the Manchus, including the Yemaek the Xianbei, the Shiwei, and the Khitans. The area is also home to many Mongols and Hui.\nGeography and climate.\nManchuria consists mainly of the northern side of the funnel-shaped North China Craton, a large area of tilled and overlaid Precambrian rocks spanning . The North China Craton was an independent continent before the Triassic period and is known to have been the northernmost piece of land in the world during the Carboniferous. The Greater Khingan in the west is a Jurassic mountain range formed by the collision of the North China Craton with the Siberian Craton, which marked the final stage of the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea.\nNo part of Manchuria was glaciated during the Quaternary, but the surface geology of most of the lower-lying and more fertile parts of Manchuria consists of very deep layers of loess, which have been formed by the wind-borne movement of dust and till particles formed in glaciated parts of the Himalayas, Kunlun Mountains and Tian Shan, as well as the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts. Soils are mostly fertile mollisols and fluvents except in the more mountainous parts where they have poorly developed orthents, as well as in the extreme north where permafrost occurs and orthels dominate.\nThe climate of Manchuria has extreme seasonal contrasts, ranging from humid, almost tropical heat in summer to windy, dry, Arctic cold in winter. This pattern occurs because the position of Manchuria on the boundary between the great Eurasian continental landmass and the huge Pacific Ocean causes complete monsoonal wind reversal.\nIn summer, when the land heats faster than the ocean, low-pressure forms over Asia and warm, moist south to southeasterly winds bring heavy, thundery rain, yielding annual rainfall ranging from , or less in the west, to over in the Changbai Mountains. Temperatures in summer are very warm to hot, with July average maxima ranging from in the south to in the extreme north.\nIn winter, however, the vast Siberian High causes very cold, north-to-northwesterly winds that bring temperatures as low as in the extreme south and in the north where the zone of discontinuous permafrost reaches northern Heilongjiang. However, because the winds from Siberia are exceedingly dry, snow falls only on a few days every winter, and it is never heavy. This explains why corresponding latitudes of North America were fully glaciated during glacial periods of the Quaternary while Manchuria, though even colder, always remained too dry to form glaciers\u00a0\u2013 a state of affairs enhanced by stronger westerly winds from the surface of the ice sheet in Europe.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nManchuria was the homeland of several ethnic groups, including Manchu, Mongols, Koreans, Nanai, Nivkhs, Ulchs, Hui. Various ethnic groups and their respective kingdoms, including the Sushen, Donghu, Xianbei, Wuhuan, Mohe, Khitan and Jurchens, have risen to power in Manchuria. Koreanic kingdoms such as Gojoseon (before 108 BCE), Buyeo (2nd century BCE to 494 CE) and Goguryeo (37 BCE to 688 CE) also became established in large parts of this area. The Chinese Qin (221\u2013206 BCE), Han (202 BCE\u20139 CE and 25 CE\u2013220 CE), Cao Wei (220\u2013266), Western Jin (266\u2013316), and Tang (618\u2013690 and 705\u2013907) dynasties controlled parts of Manchuria. Parts of northwestern Manchuria came under the control of the First Turkic Khaganate of 552\u2013603 and of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate of 581\u2013630. Early Manchuria had a mixed economy of hunting, fishing, livestock, and agriculture.\nWith the Song dynasty (960\u20131269) to the south, the Khitan people of Inner Mongolia created the Liao dynasty (916\u20131125) and conquered Outer Mongolia and Manchuria, going on to control the adjacent part of the Sixteen Prefectures in Northern China as well. The Liao dynasty became the first state to control all of Manchuria.\nIn the early 12th century, the Tungusic Jurchen people, who were Liao's tributaries, overthrew the Liao and formed the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), which went on to control parts of Northern China and Mongolia after a series of successful military campaigns. During the Mongol Yuan dynasty rule of China (1271\u20131368), Manchuria was administered as Liaoyang province. In 1375 Naghachu, a Mongol official of the Mongolia-based Northern Yuan dynasty of 1368\u20131635 in Liaoyang province invaded Liaodong, but later surrendered to the Ming dynasty in 1387. In order to protect the northern border areas, the Ming dynasty decided to \"pacify\" the Jurchens in order to deal with its problems with Yuan remnants along its northern border. The Ming solidified control over Manchuria under the Yongle Emperor (r.\u20091402\u00a0\u2013\u00a01424), establishing the Nurgan Regional Military Commission of 1409\u20131435. Starting in the 1580s, a Jianzhou Jurchen chieftain, Nurhaci (1558\u20131626), started to unify Jurchen tribes of the region. Over the next several decades, the Jurchen took control of most of Manchuria. In 1616 Nurhaci founded the Later Jin dynasty, which later became known as the Qing dynasty. The Qing defeated the Evenk-Daur federation led by the Evenki chief Bombogor and beheaded Bombogor in 1640, with Qing armies massacring and deporting Evenkis and absorbing the survivors into the Banners.\nChinese cultural and religious influence such as Chinese New Year, the \"Chinese god\", motifs such as the dragon, spirals, and scrolls, agriculture, husbandry, methods of heating, and material goods such as iron cooking-pots, silk, and cotton spread among the Amur natives including the Udeghes, Ulchis, and Nanais.\nIn 1644, after peasant rebels sacked the Ming dynasty's capital of Beijing, the Jurchens (now called Manchus) allied with Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing, overthrowing the short-lived Shun dynasty (1644) and establishing Qing-dynasty rule (1644\u20131912) over all of China. The Manchu conquest of China involved the deaths of over 25\u00a0million people. The Qing dynasty built the Willow Palisade \u2013 a system of ditches and embankments \u2013 during the later 17th century to restrict the movement of Han civilians into Jilin and Heilongjiang. Only bannermen, including Han bannermen, were allowed to settle in Jilin and Heilongjiang.\nAfter conquering the Ming, the Qing often identified their state as \"China\" (\u4e2d\u570b, \"Zhongguo\"; \"Middle Kingdom\"), and referred to it as \"Dulimbai Gurun\" (\"Middle Kingdom\") in Manchu. In the \"Qing shilu\" the lands of the Qing state (including Manchuria and present-day Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet) are thus identified as \"the Middle Kingdom\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages in roughly two-thirds of the cases, while the term refers to the traditional Chinese provinces populated by the Han in roughly one third of the cases. It was also common to use \"China\" (\"Zhongguo\", \"Dulimbai gurun\") to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs. In diplomatic documents, the term \"Chinese language\" (\"Dulimbai gurun i bithe\") referred to the Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \"Chinese people\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing. The Qing explicitly stated that the lands in Manchuria belonged to \"China\" (Zhongguo, Dulimbai gurun) in Qing edicts and in the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk.\nPopulation change.\nThe Manchu rules of the Qing dynasty initially prohibited Han Chinese from settling in the region.32 Despite this restriction, a constant flow of Han Chinese farmers from North China settled there.32\nManchu landlords desired Han Chinese peasants to rent their land and to grow grain; most Han Chinese migrants were not evicted as they crossed the Great Wall and Willow Palisade. During the eighteenth century Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares of privately owned land in Manchuria and 203,583 hectares of lands which were part of courier stations, noble estates, and Banner lands; in garrisons and towns in Manchuria Han Chinese made up 80% of the population.\nThe Qing resettled Han Chinese farmers from north China to the area along the Liao River in order to restore the land to cultivation. Han Chinese squatters reclaimed wasteland, and other Han rented land from Manchu landlords.\nBy the 18th century, despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on Manchu and Mongol lands, the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China \u2013 who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought \u2013 into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, so that Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s. The Qianlong Emperor (r.\u20091735\u00a0\u2013\u00a01796) allowed Han Chinese peasants suffering from drought to move into Manchuria despite his having issued edicts in favor of banning them from 1740 to 1776. Han Chinese then streamed into Manchuria, both illegally and legally, over the Great Wall of China and the Willow Palisade. Chinese tenant farmers rented or even claimed title to land from the \"imperial estates\" and Manchu Bannerlands in the area. Besides moving into the Liao area in southern Manchuria, Han Chinese settled the path linking Jinzhou, Fengtian, Tieling, Changchun, Hulun, and Ningguta during the Qianlong Emperor's reign, and Han Chinese had become the majority in urban areas of Manchuria by 1800. To increase the Imperial Treasury's revenue, the Qing sold formerly Manchu-only lands along the Sungari to Han Chinese at the beginning of the Daoguang Emperor's 1820\u20131850 reign, and Han Chinese filled up most of Manchuria's towns by the 1840s, according to Abb\u00e9 Huc.\nThe demographic change was not caused solely by Han migration. Manchus also refused to stay in Manchuria. In the late 18th century, Manchus in Beijing were sent to Manchuria as part of a plan to reduce the burden on the court, but they tried to return by every means possible. With the exception of 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers and their families and a military colony established in the 1850s, Manchuria was devoid of Manchus. By 1900, 15 million of Manchuria's 17 million inhabitants were Han Chinese.\nRussian invasions.\nThe Russian conquest of Siberia was met with indigenous resistance to colonization, but Russian Cossacks crushed the natives. The conquest of Siberia and Manchuria also resulted in the spread of infectious diseases. Historian John F. Richards wrote: \"... New diseases weakened and demoralized the indigenous peoples of Siberia. The worst of these was smallpox \"because of its swift spread, the high death rates, and the permanent disfigurement of survivors.\" ... In the 1690s, smallpox epidemics reduced Yukagir numbers by an estimated 44 percent.\" At the behest of people like Vasilii Poyarkov in 1645 and Yerofei Khabarov in 1650, Russian Cossacks killed some peoples like the Daur people of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang to the extent that some authors speak of genocide.\nThe Daurs initially deserted their villages since they had heard about the cruelty of the Russians the first time Khabarov came. The second time he came, the Daurs decided to do battle against the Russians instead, but were slaughtered by Russian guns. The Russians came to be known as \"red-beards\". The Amur natives called Russian Cossacks \"luocha\" (\u7f85\u524e), after demons in Buddhist mythology, because of their cruelty towards the Amur tribespeople, who were subjects of the Qing. The Qing viewed Russian proselytization of Eastern Orthodox Christianity to the indigenous peoples along the Amur River as a threat.\nIn 1858 Russian diplomacy forced a weakening Qing dynasty to cede Manchuria north of the Amur to Russia under the Treaty of Aigun. In 1860, with the Treaty of Peking, the Russians managed to obtain a further large slice of Manchuria, east of the Ussuri River. As a result, Manchuria became divided into a Russian half (known as Outer Manchuria or Russian Manchuria), and a remaining Chinese region (known as Manchuria). In modern literature, \"Manchuria\" usually refers to Manchuria in China. As a result of the Treaties of Aigun and Peking, Qing China lost access to the Sea of Japan.\nHistory after 1860.\nTo counter the increasing influence of Meiji era Japan in the region, the Qing granted Russia the right to construct railways in Manchuria, including the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1896.32\nIn the \"Chuang Guandong\" movement, many Han farmers, mostly from the Shandong peninsula moved there. By 1921, Harbin, northern Manchuria's largest city, had a population of 300,000, including 100,000 Russians. Japan replaced Russian influence in the southern half of Manchuria as a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904\u20131905. Most of the southern branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway was transferred from Russia to Japan, and became the South Manchurian Railway. Japanese influence extended into Outer Manchuria in the wake of the Russian Revolution of 1917, but Outer Manchuria had reverted to Soviet control by 1925. Manchuria was an important region due to its rich natural resources including coal, fertile soil, and various minerals. For pre\u2013World War II Japan, Manchuria was an essential source of raw materials. Without occupying Manchuria, the Japanese probably could not have carried out their plan for conquest over Southeast Asia or taken the risk of attacking the United States and the British Empire in 1941.\nThere was a major epidemic known as the Manchurian plague in 1910\u20131911, likely caused by the inexperienced hunting of marmots, many of whom are diseased. The cheap railway transport and the harsh winters, where the hunters sheltered in close confinement, helped to propagate the disease. The response required close coordination between the Chinese, Russian and Japanese authorities and international disease experts held an 'International Plague Conference' in the northern city of Shenyang after the disease was under control to learn the lessons.\nIn 1915, Japan forced China to cede economic privileges in Manchuria to Japan, including concessions in Anshan.29\nIt was reported that among Banner people, both Manchu and Chinese (Hanjun) in Aihun, Heilongjiang in the 1920s, would seldom marry with Han civilians, but they (Manchu and Chinese Bannermen) would mostly intermarry with each other. Owen Lattimore reported that during his January 1930 visit to Manchuria, he studied a community in Jilin (Kirin), where both Manchu and Chinese Bannermen were settled at a town called Wulakai, and eventually the Chinese Bannermen there could not be differentiated from Manchus since they were effectively Manjurified. The Han civilian population was in the process of absorbing and mixing with them when Lattimore wrote his article.\nAround the time of World War I, Zhang Zuolin established himself as a powerful warlord with influence over most of Manchuria. Zhang established an autonomous rule that nominally acknowledged the Republic of China (ROC). Japan co-opted Zhang and retained its semi-colonial economic privileges.34 During Zhang's rule, the Manchurian economy grew tremendously, backed by the immigration of Chinese from other parts of China. After Zhang was defeated in the Northern Expedition and retreated back to Manchuria from Beijing, Japanese army officers assassinated him41 on 2 June 1928, in what is known as the Huanggutun Incident. These Japanese officers sought for Japan to take direct control of Manchuria, but the Japanese government did not support the plan.41 Zhang's son Zhang Xueliang became Manchuria's new ruler.41 He directed public funds towards the development of Chinese industrial enterprises in the region.41\nFollowing the Mukden incident in 1931 and the subsequent Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the Japanese declared Manchuria an \"independent state\", and appointed the deposed Qing emperor Puyi as puppet emperor of Manchukuo. Under Japanese control, Manchuria was brutally run, with a systematic campaign of terror and intimidation against the local populations including arrests, organised riots and other forms of subjugation. Manchukuo was used by Japan as a base to invade the rest of China. At that time, hundreds of thousands of Japanese settlers arrived in Manchuria.\nAt the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Joseph Stalin agreed that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months after Germany surrendered, and the United States and United Kingdom agreed that the Soviet Union could pursue its claimed interests in Manchuria.72 Accordingly, in August the Soviet Union issued its declaration of war and launched the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. Soviet forces controlled Manchuria until they left in Spring 1946.64 Afterwards, China's Nationalist government took control of Manchuria.63 Soon afterwards, the Chinese Communist Party and the Nationalists started fighting for control over Manchuria. The communists won in the Liaoshen Campaign. With the encouragement of the Soviet Union, Manchuria was then used as a staging ground during the Chinese Civil War for the Chinese Communist Party, which emerged victorious in 1949. Ambiguities in the treaties that ceded Outer Manchuria to Russia led to disputes over the political status of several islands. The Kuomintang government in Taiwan (Formosa) complained to the United Nations, which passed resolution 505 on 1 February 1952, denouncing Soviet actions over the violations of the 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance.\nPeople's Republic of China.\nThe historical region of Manchuria is composed of the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang.\nManchuria was a central focus of China's approach to \"socialist industrialization\" following the founding of the People's Republic of China.1 Strongly influenced by the Soviet approach to industrialization, development policy focused on heavy-industry state-owned enterprises, such as Angang in Anshan.1 The discovery and development of Daqing oil field made Manchuria the center of China's oil industry beginning in the 1960s.15\nDuring the Third Front Construction, the region was a major supplier of staff for the newly developed industrial bases in China's interior.16\nThe Sino-Soviet split led to the Sino-Soviet border conflict, which ultimately resulted in an agreement. In 2004, Russia agreed to transfer Yinlong Island and one half of Heixiazi Island to China, ending an enduring border dispute, and this agreement was finalized in 2008.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The original target year for completion was 2003.\nSince then, other members joined:\nKEDO discussions took place at the level of a U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, South Korea's deputy foreign minister, and the head of the Asian bureau of Japan's Foreign Ministry.\nThe KEDO Secretariat was located in New York. KEDO was shut down in 2006.\nHistory.\nFormal ground breaking on the site for two light water reactors (LWR) was on August 19, 1997, at Kumho, 30\u00a0km north of Sinpo. The Kumho site had been previously selected for two similar sized reactors that had been promised in the 1980s by the Soviet Union, before its collapse.\nSoon after the Agreed Framework was signed, U.S. Congress control changed to the Republican Party, who did not support the agreement. Some Republican Senators were strongly against the agreement, regarding it as appeasement. KEDO's first director, Stephen Bosworth, later commented \"The Agreed Framework was a political orphan within two weeks after its signature\".\nArranging project financing was not easy, and formal invitations to bid were not issued until 1998, by which time the delays were infuriating North Korea. Significant spending on the LWR project did not commence until 2000, with \"First Concrete\" pouring at the construction site on August 7, 2002. Construction of both reactors was well behind the original schedule.\nIn the wake of the breakdown of the Agreed Framework in 2003, KEDO largely lost its function. KEDO ensured that the nuclear power plant project assets at the construction site at Kumho in North Korea and at manufacturers' facilities around the world ($1.5 billion invested to date) were preserved and maintained. The project was reported to be about 30% complete. One reactor containment building was about 50% complete and another about 15% finished. No key equipment for the reactors had been moved to the site.\nIn 2005, there were reports indicating that KEDO had agreed in principle to terminate the light-water reactor project. On January 9, 2006, it was announced that the project was over and the workers would be returning to their home countries. North Korea demanded compensation and has refused to return the approximately $45 million worth of equipment left behind.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A group that is not simple can be broken into two smaller groups, namely a nontrivial normal subgroup and the corresponding quotient group. This process can be repeated, and for finite groups one eventually arrives at uniquely determined simple groups, by the Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder theorem.\nThe complete classification of finite simple groups, completed in 2004, is a major milestone in the history of mathematics.\nExamples.\nFinite simple groups.\nThe cyclic group formula_1 of congruence classes modulo 3 (see modular arithmetic) is simple. If formula_2 is a subgroup of this group, its order (the number of elements) must be a divisor of the order of formula_3 which is 3. Since 3 is prime, its only divisors are 1 and 3, so either formula_2 is formula_3, or formula_2 is the trivial group. On the other hand, the group formula_7 is not simple. The set formula_2 of congruence classes of 0, 4, and 8 modulo 12 is a subgroup of order 3, and it is a normal subgroup since any subgroup of an abelian group is normal. Similarly, the additive group of the integers formula_9 is not simple; the set of even integers is a non-trivial proper normal subgroup.\nOne may use the same kind of reasoning for any abelian group, to deduce that the only simple abelian groups are the cyclic groups of prime order. The classification of nonabelian simple groups is far less trivial. The smallest nonabelian simple group is the alternating group formula_10 of order 60, and every simple group of order 60 is isomorphic to formula_10. The second smallest nonabelian simple group is the projective special linear group PSL(2,7) of order 168, and every simple group of order 168 is isomorphic to PSL(2,7).\nInfinite simple groups.\nThe infinite alternating group formula_12, i.e. the group of even finitely supported permutations of the integers, is simple. This group can be written as the increasing union of the finite simple groups formula_13 with respect to standard embeddings formula_14. Another family of examples of infinite simple groups is given by formula_15, where formula_16 is an infinite field and formula_17.\nIt is much more difficult to construct \"finitely generated\" infinite simple groups. The first existence result is non-explicit; it is due to Graham Higman and consists of simple quotients of the Higman group. Explicit examples, which turn out to be finitely presented, include the infinite Thompson groups formula_18 and formula_19. Finitely presented torsion-free infinite simple groups were constructed by Burger and Mozes.\nClassification.\nThere is as yet no known classification for general (infinite) simple groups, and no such classification is expected. One reason for this is the existence of continuum-many Tarski monster groups for every sufficiently-large prime characteristic, each simple and having only the cyclic group of that characteristic as its subgroups.\nFinite simple groups.\nThe finite simple groups are important because in a certain sense they are the \"basic building blocks\" of all finite groups, somewhat similar to the way prime numbers are the basic building blocks of the integers. This is expressed by the Jordan\u2013H\u00f6lder theorem which states that any two composition series of a given group have the same length and the same factors, up to permutation and isomorphism. In a huge collaborative effort, the classification of finite simple groups was declared accomplished in 1983 by Daniel Gorenstein, though some problems surfaced (specifically in the classification of quasithin groups, which were plugged in 2004).\nBriefly, finite simple groups are classified as lying in one of 18 families, or being one of 26 exceptions:\nStructure of finite simple groups.\nThe famous theorem of Feit and Thompson states that every group of odd order is solvable. Therefore, every finite simple group has even order unless it is cyclic of prime order.\nThe Schreier conjecture asserts that the group of outer automorphisms of every finite simple group is solvable. This can be proved using the classification theorem.\nHistory for finite simple groups.\nThere are two threads in the history of finite simple groups \u2013 the discovery and construction of specific simple groups and families, which took place from the work of Galois in the 1820s to the construction of the Monster in 1981; and proof that this list was complete, which began in the 19th century, most significantly took place 1955 through 1983 (when victory was initially declared), but was only generally agreed to be finished in 2004. By 2018, its publication was envisioned as a series of 12 monographs, the tenth of which was published in 2023. See for 19th century history of simple groups.\nConstruction.\nSimple groups have been studied at least since early Galois theory, where \u00c9variste Galois realized that the fact that the alternating groups on five or more points are simple (and hence not solvable), which he proved in 1831, was the reason that one could not solve the quintic in radicals. Galois also constructed the projective special linear group of a plane over a prime finite field, PSL(2,\"p\"), and remarked that they were simple for \"p\" not 2 or 3. This is contained in his last letter to Chevalier, and are the next example of finite simple groups.\nThe next discoveries were by Camille Jordan in 1870. Jordan had found 4 families of simple matrix groups over finite fields of prime order, which are now known as the classical groups.\nAt about the same time, it was shown that a family of five groups, called the Mathieu groups and first described by \u00c9mile L\u00e9onard Mathieu in 1861 and 1873, were also simple. Since these five groups were constructed by methods which did not yield infinitely many possibilities, they were called \"sporadic\" by William Burnside in his 1897 textbook.\nLater Jordan's results on classical groups were generalized to arbitrary finite fields by Leonard Dickson, following the classification of complex simple Lie algebras by Wilhelm Killing. Dickson also constructed exception groups of type G2 and E6 as well, but not of types F4, E7, or E8 . In the 1950s the work on groups of Lie type was continued, with Claude Chevalley giving a uniform construction of the classical groups and the groups of exceptional type in a 1955 paper. This omitted certain known groups (the projective unitary groups), which were obtained by \"twisting\" the Chevalley construction. The remaining groups of Lie type were produced by Steinberg, Tits, and Herzig (who produced 3\"D\"4(\"q\") and 2\"E\"6(\"q\")) and by Suzuki and Ree (the Suzuki\u2013Ree groups).\nThese groups (the groups of Lie type, together with the cyclic groups, alternating groups, and the five exceptional Mathieu groups) were believed to be a complete list, but after a lull of almost a century since the work of Mathieu, in 1964 the first Janko group was discovered, and the remaining 20 sporadic groups were discovered or conjectured in 1965\u20131975, culminating in 1981, when Robert Griess announced that he had constructed Bernd Fischer's \"Monster group\". The Monster is the largest sporadic simple group having order of 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000. The Monster has a faithful 196,883-dimensional representation in the 196,884-dimensional Griess algebra, meaning that each element of the Monster can be expressed as a 196,883 by 196,883 matrix.\nClassification.\nThe full classification is generally accepted as beginning with the Feit\u2013Thompson theorem of 1962\u20131963 and being completed in 2004.\nSoon after the construction of the Monster in 1981, a proof, totaling more than 10,000 pages, was supplied in 1983 by Daniel Gorenstein, that claimed to successfully list all finite simple groups. This was premature, as gaps were later discovered in the classification of quasithin groups. The gaps were filled in 2004 by a 1300 page classification of quasithin groups and the proof is now generally accepted as complete.\nTests for nonsimplicity.\n\"Sylow's test\": Let \"n\" be a positive integer that is not prime, and let \"p\" be a prime divisor of \"n\". If 1 is the only divisor of \"n\" that is congruent to 1 modulo \"p\", then there does not exist a simple group of order \"n\".\nProof: If \"n\" is a prime-power, then a group of order \"n\" has a nontrivial center and, therefore, is not simple. If \"n\" is not a prime power, then every Sylow subgroup is proper, and, by Sylow's Third Theorem, we know that the number of Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of a group of order \"n\" is equal to 1 modulo \"p\" and divides \"n\". Since 1 is the only such number, the Sylow \"p\"-subgroup is unique, and therefore it is normal. Since it is a proper, non-identity subgroup, the group is not simple.\n\"Burnside\": A non-Abelian finite simple group has order divisible by at least three distinct primes. This follows from Burnside's theorem.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTextbooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPapers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "47607", "revid": "11614533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47607", "title": "Suspension bridge", "text": "Type of bridge\nA suspension bridge is a type of bridge in which the deck is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 1800s. Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world.\nBesides the bridge type most commonly called suspension bridges, covered in this article, there are other types of suspension bridges. The type covered here has cables suspended between towers, with vertical \"suspender cables\" that transfer the live and dead loads of the deck below, upon which traffic crosses. This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance. Like other suspension bridge types, this type often is constructed without the use of falsework.\nThe suspension cables must be anchored at each end of the bridge, since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into tension in these main cables. The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods, called hangers. In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or canyon edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span. Otherwise, the bridge will typically have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or their own trusswork. In cases where trusswork supports the spans, there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables.\nHistory.\nThe earliest suspension bridges were ropes slung across a chasm, with a deck possibly at the same level or hung below the ropes such that the rope had a catenary shape.\nPrecursors.\nThe Tibetan siddha and bridge-builder Thangtong Gyalpo originated the use of iron chains in his version of simple suspension bridges. In 1433, Gyalpo built eight bridges in eastern Bhutan. The last surviving chain-linked bridge of Gyalpo's was the Thangtong Gyalpo Bridge in Duksum en route to Trashi Yangtse, which was finally washed away in 2004. Gyalpo's iron chain bridges did not include a suspended-deck bridge, which is the standard on all modern suspension bridges today. Instead, both the railing and the walking layer of Gyalpo's bridges used wires. The stress points that carried the screed were reinforced by the iron chains. Before the use of iron chains it is thought that Gyalpo used ropes from twisted willows or yak skins. He may have also used tightly bound cloth.\nThe Inca used rope bridges, documented as early as 1615. It is not known when they were first made. Queshuachaca is considered the last remaining Inca rope bridge and is rebuilt annually.\nChain bridges.\nThe first iron chain suspension bridge in the Western world was the Jacob's Creek Bridge (1801) in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, designed by inventor James Finley. Finley's bridge was the first to incorporate all of the necessary components of a modern suspension bridge, including a suspended deck which hung by trusses. Finley patented his design in 1808, and published it in the Philadelphia journal, The Port Folio, in 1810.\nEarly British chain bridges included the Dryburgh Abbey Bridge (1817) and 137 m Union Bridge (1820), with spans rapidly increasing to 176 m with the Menai Bridge (1826), \"the first important modern suspension bridge\". The first chain bridge on the German speaking territories was the Chain Bridge in Nuremberg. The Sagar Iron Suspension Bridge with a 200 feet span (also termed Beose Bridge) was constructed near Sagar, India during 1828\u20131830 by Duncan Presgrave, Mint and Assay Master. The Clifton Suspension Bridge (designed in 1831, completed in 1864 with a 214 m central span), is similar to the Sagar bridge. It is one of the longest of the parabolic arc chain type. The current Marlow suspension bridge was designed by William Tierney Clark and was built between 1829 and 1832, replacing a wooden bridge further downstream which collapsed in 1828. It is the only suspension bridge across the non-tidal Thames. The Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge, (designed in 1840, opened in 1849), spanning the River Danube in Budapest, was also designed by William Clark and it is a larger-scale version of Marlow Bridge.\nOne variation is the Thornewill and Warham's Ferry Bridge in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire (1889), where the chains are not attached to abutments as is usual, but instead are attached to the main girders, which are thus in compression. Here, the chains are made from flat wrought iron plates, eight inches (203\u00a0mm) wide by an inch and a half (38\u00a0mm) thick, rivetted together.\nWire-cable.\n The first wire-cable suspension bridge was the Spider Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill (1816), a modest and temporary footbridge built following the collapse of James Finley's nearby Chain Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill (1808). The footbridge's span was 124 m, although its deck was only 0.45 m wide.\nDevelopment of wire-cable suspension bridges dates to the temporary simple suspension bridge at Annonay built by Marc Seguin and his brothers in 1822. It spanned only 18 m. The first permanent wire cable suspension bridge was Guillaume Henri Dufour's Saint Antoine Bridge in Geneva of 1823, with two 40 m spans. The first with cables assembled in mid-air in the modern method was Joseph Chaley's Grand Pont Suspendu in Fribourg, in 1834.\nIn the United States, the first major wire-cable suspension bridge was the in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Designed by Charles Ellet Jr. and completed in 1842, it had a span of 109 m. Ellet's Niagara Falls suspension bridge (1847\u201348) was abandoned before completion. It was used as scaffolding for John A. Roebling's double decker railroad and carriage bridge (1855).\nThe Otto Beit Bridge (1938\u20131939) was the first modern suspension bridge outside the United States built with parallel wire cables.\nStructure.\nBridge main components.\nTwo towers/pillars, two suspension cables, four suspension cable anchors, multiple suspender cables, the bridge deck.\nStructural analysis.\nThe main cables of a suspension bridge will form a catenary when hanging under their own weight only. When supporting the deck, the cables will instead form a parabola, assuming the weight of the cables is small compared to the weight of the deck. One can see the shape from the constant increase of the gradient of the cable with linear (deck) distance, this increase in gradient at each connection with the deck providing a net upward support force. Combined with the relatively simple constraints placed upon the actual deck, that makes the suspension bridge much simpler to design and analyze than a cable-stayed bridge in which the deck is in compression.\nComparison with cable-stayed bridge.\nCable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges may appear to be similar, but are quite different in principle and in their construction.\nIn suspension bridges, large main cables (normally two) hang between the towers and are anchored at each end to the ground. The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as it does with the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards compression on the towers.\nIn cable-stayed bridges, the towers are the primary load-bearing structures that transmit the bridge loads to the ground. A cantilever approach is often used to support the bridge deck near the towers, but lengths further from them are supported by cables running directly to the towers. By design, all static horizontal forces of the cable-stayed bridge are balanced so that the supporting towers do not tend to tilt or slide and so must only resist horizontal forces from the live loads.\nVariations.\nUnderspanned.\nIn an underspanned suspension bridge, also called under-deck cable-stayed bridge, the main cables hang entirely below the bridge deck, but are still anchored into the ground in a similar way to the conventional type. Very few bridges of this nature have been built, as the deck is inherently less stable than when suspended below the cables. Examples include the Pont des Bergues of 1834 designed by Guillaume Henri Dufour; James Smith's Micklewood Bridge; and a proposal by Robert Stevenson for a bridge over the River Almond near Edinburgh.\nRoebling's Delaware Aqueduct (begun 1847) consists of three sections supported by cables. The timber structure essentially hides the cables; and from a quick view, it is not immediately apparent that it is even a suspension bridge.\nSuspension cable types.\nThe main suspension cables in older bridges were often made from a chain or linked bars, but modern bridge cables are made from multiple strands of wire rope. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because the failure of a few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or eyebar can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single eyebar was found to be the cause of the collapse of the Silver Bridge over the Ohio River.) Another reason is that as spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas wire strand cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.\nSuspender-cable terminations.\nPoured sockets are used to make a high strength, permanent cable termination. They are created by inserting the suspender wire rope (at the bridge deck supports) into the narrow end of a conical cavity that is oriented in-line with the intended direction of strain. The individual wires are splayed out inside the cone or capel, and the cone is then filled with molten lead-antimony-tin (Pb80Sb15Sn5) solder.\nDeck structure types.\nMost suspension bridges have open truss structures to support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940) bridge collapse. In the 1960s, developments in bridge aerodynamics allowed the re-introduction of plate structures as shallow box girders, first seen on the Severn bridge, built 1961\u20131966. In the picture of the Yichang Bridge, note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this type of construction to be used without the danger of vortex shedding and consequent aeroelastic effects, such as those that destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.\nForces.\nThree kinds of forces operate on any bridge: the dead load, the live load, and the dynamic load. Dead load refers to the weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a tendency to collapse simply because of the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors that go beyond normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.\nUse other than road and rail.\nThe principles of suspension used on a large scale also appear in contexts less dramatic than road or rail bridges. Light cable suspension may prove less expensive and seem more elegant for a cycle or footbridge than strong girder supports. An example of this is the Nescio Bridge in the Netherlands, and the Roebling designed 1904 Riegelsville suspension pedestrian bridge across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania. The longest pedestrian suspension bridge, which spans the River Paiva, Arouca Geopark, Portugal, opened in April 2021. The 516 metres bridge hangs 175 meters above the river.\nWhere such a bridge spans a gap between two buildings, there is no need to construct towers, as the buildings can anchor the cables. Cable suspension may also be augmented by the inherent stiffness of a structure that has much in common with a tubular bridge.\nConstruction sequence (wire strand cable type).\nTypical suspension bridges are constructed using a sequence generally described as follows. Depending on length and size, construction may take anywhere between a year and a half (construction of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge took only 19 months) and a decade (as with the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge).\nLongest spans.\nSuspension bridges are typically ranked by the length of their main span. These are the ten bridges with the longest spans, followed by the length of the span and the year the bridge opened for traffic:\nNotable collapses.\nBroughton Suspension Bridge (England) was an iron chain bridge built in 1826. One of Europe's first suspension bridges, it collapsed in 1831 due to mechanical resonance induced by troops marching in step. As a result of the incident, the British Army issued an order that troops should \"break step\" when crossing a bridge.\nSilver Bridge (USA) was an eyebar chain highway bridge, built in 1928, that collapsed in late 1967, killing forty-six people. The bridge had a low-redundancy design that was difficult to inspect. The collapse inspired legislation to ensure that older bridges were regularly inspected and maintained. Following the collapse a bridge of similar design was immediately closed and eventually demolished. A second similarly-designed bridge had been built with a higher margin of safety and remained in service until 1991. \nThe Tacoma Narrows Bridge, (USA), 1940, was vulnerable to structural vibration in sustained and moderately strong winds due to its plate-girder deck structure. Wind caused a phenomenon called aeroelastic fluttering that led to its collapse only months after completion. The collapse was captured on film. There were no human deaths in the collapse; several drivers escaped their cars on foot and reached the anchorages before the span dropped.\nYarmouth suspension bridge (England) was built in 1829 and collapsed in 1845, killing 79 people.\nPeace River Suspension Bridge (Canada), which was completed in 1943, collapsed when the north anchor's soil support for the suspension bridge failed in October 1957. The entire bridge subsequently collapsed.\nKutai Kartanegara Bridge (Indonesia) over the Mahakam River, located in Kutai Kartanegara Regency, East Kalimantan district on the Indonesia island of Borneo, was built in 1995, completed in 2001 and collapsed in 2011. Dozens of vehicles on the bridge fell into the Mahakam River. As a result of this incident, 24 people died and dozens of others were injured and were treated at the Aji Muhammad Parikesit Regional Hospital. Meanwhile, 12 people were reported missing, 31 people were seriously injured, and 8 people had minor injuries. Research findings indicate that the collapse was largely caused by the construction failure of the vertical hanging clamp. It was also found that poor maintenance, fatigue in the cable hanger construction materials, material quality, and bridge loads that exceed vehicle capacity, can also have an impact on bridge collapse. In 2013 the Kutai Kartanegara Bridge rebuilt the same location and completed in 2015 with a Through arch bridge design.\nOn 30 October 2022, Jhulto Pul, a pedestrian suspension bridge over the Machchhu River in the city of Morbi, Gujarat, India, collapsed, leading to the deaths of at least 141 people.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It consists of a road suspension bridge and a railway tunnel between Zealand and the small island Sprog\u00f8 in the middle of the Great Belt, and a box-girder bridge for both road and rail traffic between Sprog\u00f8 and Funen. The total length is .\nThe term \"Great Belt Bridge\" commonly refers to the suspension bridge, although it may also be used to mean the box-girder bridge, especially when discussing the railway, or the link in its entirety. Together with the New Little Belt Bridge, the Great Belt link provides a continuous road and rail connection between Copenhagen and the Danish mainland (the Jutland Peninsula of the European continent). It has the world's seventh-longest main span (). Operation and maintenance of the bridge are performed by \"A/S Storeb\u00e6lt\" under \"Sund &amp; B\u00e6lt\". Maintenance and the original construction are financed by tolls on vehicles and trains making use of the bridge.\nOfficially named the East Bridge, the suspension bridge was designed by the Danish firms COWI and Ramboll, and the architecture firm Dissing+Weitling. The construction and assembly of the suspended deck were carried out by the company https:// with the consultancy of the Italian https:// under the direction of Mario de Miranda. The link replaced the Great Belt ferries service, which had been the primary means of crossing the Great Belt. After more than 50 years of debate, the Danish government decided in 1986 to construct a link; the bridge opened to rail traffic in 1997 and to road traffic in 1998, at the time the world's second longest, beaten by the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge opened a few months previously. At an estimated cost of DKK 21.4 billion (EUR 2.8 billion) (1988 prices), the link is the largest construction project in Danish history. It has reduced travel times significantly; previously taking one hour by ferry, the Great Belt can now be crossed in ten minutes. This link, together with the \u00d8resund Bridge (built 1995\u20131999) and the Little Belt Bridge, have together enabled driving from mainland Europe to Sweden through Denmark.\nHistory.\nThe Great Belt ferries entered service between the coastal towns of Kors\u00f8r and Nyborg in 1883, connecting the railway lines on either side of the Belt. In 1957, road traffic was moved to the Halsskov\u2013Knudshoved route, about 1.5 kilometres to the north and close to the fixed link.\nConstruction drafts for a fixed link were presented as early as the 1850s, with several suggestions appearing in the following decades. The Danish State Railways, responsible for the ferry service, presented plans for a bridge in 1934. The concepts of bridges over \u00d8resund (152 million DKK) and Storeb\u00e6lt (257 million DKK) were calculated around 1936. In 1948, the Ministry for Public Works (now the Ministry of Transport) established a commission to investigate the implications of a fixed link.\nThe first law concerning a fixed link was enacted in 1973, but the project was put on hold in 1978 as the Venstre (Liberal) party demanded postponing public spending. Political agreement to restart work was reached in 1986, with a construction law () being passed in 1987.\nThe design was carried out by the engineering firms COWI and Ramboll together with Dissing+Weitling architecture practice.\nConstruction of the link commenced in 1988. In 1991, Finland sued Denmark at the International Court of Justice, on the grounds that Finnish-built mobile offshore drilling units would be unable to pass beneath the bridge. The two countries negotiated a financial compensation of 90 million Danish kroner, and Finland withdrew the lawsuit in 1992.\nA European Court of Justice ruling in 1993 found that a contractual condition requiring use of local labour and local materials in constructing the bridge was incompatible with the principles of the EEC Treaty.\nThe link is estimated to have created a value of 379 billion DKK after 50 years of use.\nIn 2022, the bridge was crossed as part of the route of Stage 2 of the 2022 Tour de France.\nConstruction.\nThe construction of the fixed link became the biggest building project in the history of Denmark. In order to connect Halsskov on Zealand with Knudshoved on Funen, to its west, a two-track railway and a four-lane motorway had to be built, via the small island of Sprog\u00f8 in the middle of the Great Belt. The project comprised three different tasks: the East Bridge for road transport, the East Tunnel for rail transport and the West Bridge for road and rail transport combined. The construction work was carried out by Sundlink Contractors, a consortium of Skanska, Hochtief, H\u00f8jgaard &amp; Schultz (which built the West Bridge) and Monberg &amp; Thorsen (which built the section under the Great Belt). The work of lifting and placing the elements was carried out by Ballast Nedam using a floating crane.\nEast Bridge.\nBuilt between 1991 and 1998 at a cost of US$950 million, the East Bridge (\"\u00d8stbroen\") is a suspension bridge between Halsskov and Sprog\u00f8. It is long with a free span of . The East Bridge had been planned to be completed in time to be the longest bridge in the world, but there were delays in construction. Therefore, it happened that the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge was opened two months earlier.\nThe vertical clearance for ships is , meaning the world's largest cruise ship, an \"Oasis\"-class cruise ship, just fits under with its smokestack folded. At above sea level, the two pylons of the East Bridge are the highest points on self-supporting structures in Denmark. Some radio masts, such as Tommerup transmitter, are taller.\nTo keep the main cables tensioned, an anchorage structure on each side of the span is placed below the road deck. After 15 years, the cables have no rust. They were scheduled for a 15 million DKK paint job, but due to corroding cables on other bridges, the decision was made to instead install a 70 million DKK sealed de-humidifying system in the cables. This was carried out by UK engineering firm Spencer Group, with help from Danish subcontractors Davai who provided the manpower, and Belvent A/S who provided the dehumidification system.\nNineteen concrete pillars (12 on the Zealand side, seven by Sprog\u00f8), apart, carry the road deck outside the span.\nWest Bridge.\nThe West Bridge (\"Vestbroen\") is a box girder bridge between Sprog\u00f8 and Knudshoved. It is long, and has a vertical clearance for ships of . It is actually two separate, adjacent bridges: the northern one carries rail traffic and the southern one road traffic. The pillars of the two bridges rest on common foundations below sea level. The West Bridge was built between 1988 and 1994; its road/rail deck comprises 63 sections, supported by 62 pillars.\nEast Tunnel.\nThe twin bored tunnel tubes of the East Tunnel (\"\u00d8sttunnelen\") are each long. There are 31 connecting tunnels between the two main tunnels, at intervals. The equipment that is necessary for train operation in the tunnels is installed in the connecting tunnels, which also serve as emergency escape routes.\nThere were delays and cost overruns in the tunnel construction. The plan was to open it in 1993, giving the trains a head start of three years over road traffic, but train traffic started in 1997 and road traffic in 1998. During construction the sea bed gave way and one of the tunnels was flooded. The water continued to rise and reached the end at Sprog\u00f8, where it continued into the (still dry) other tunnel. The water damaged two of the four tunnel boring machines, but no workers were injured. Only by placing a clay blanket on the sea bed was it possible to dry out the tunnels. The two damaged machines were repaired and the majority of the tunnelling was undertaken from the Sprog\u00f8 side. The machines on the Zealand side tunnelled through difficult ground and made little progress. A major fire on one of the Zealand machines in June 1994 stopped these drives and the tunnels were completed by the two Sprog\u00f8 machines.\nA total of 320 compressed air workers were involved in 9,018 pressure exposures in the four tunnel-boring machines. The project had a decompression sickness incidence of 0.14% with two workers having long-term residual symptoms.\nTraffic implications.\nPrior to the opening of the link, an average of 8,000 cars used the ferries across the Great Belt every day. The traffic across the strait increased 127 percent over the first year after the link's opening due to the so-called traffic leap: new traffic generated by the improved ease, facility and lower price of crossing the Great Belt. In 2021, an average of 34,100 vehicles used the link each day. On 7 August 2022 a record 61,528 vehicles passed the bridge in 24 hours. The increase in traffic is partly caused by the general growth of traffic, partly diversion of traffic volume from other services via ferry and services.\nThe fixed link has produced considerable savings in travel time between eastern and western Denmark. Previously, it took approximately 90 minutes on average to cross the Great Belt in a car with transfer by ferry, including the waiting time at the ports. It took considerably longer during peak periods, such as weekends and holidays. With the opening of the link, the journey is now between 10 and 15 minutes.\nBy train the time savings are significant as well. The journey has been reduced by 60 minutes, and there are many more seats available because more carriages may be added to a train that does not have to fit on a ferry. The seating capacity offered by DSB across the Great Belt on an ordinary Wednesday has risen from 11,060 seats to 37,490 seats. On Fridays the seating capacity exceeds 40,000 seats.\nThe shortest travel times are: Copenhagen\u2013Odense 1 hour 15 minutes, Copenhagen\u2013Aarhus 2 hours 30 minutes, Copenhagen\u2013Aalborg 3 hours 55 minutes and Copenhagen\u2013Esbjerg 2 hours 35 minutes.\nFlights between Copenhagen and Odense, and between Copenhagen and Esbjerg have ceased, and the train now has the largest market share between Copenhagen and Aarhus.\nTogether with the \u00d8resund Bridge, and the two Little Belt Bridges (the Old and the New), the link provides a direct fixed connection between western Continental Europe and northern Scandinavia, eventually connecting all parts of the European Union except Ireland, Malta, Cyprus, and outlying islands. Most people from Zealand still prefer to take the ferry between Puttgarden and R\u00f8dby, as it is a much shorter distance and provides a needed break for those travelling a long distance.\nFor freight trains, the fixed links are a large improvement between Sweden and Germany, and between Sweden and the UK. The Sweden-to-Germany ferry system is still used to some extent owing to limited rail capacity, with heavy passenger traffic over the bridges and some single track stretches in southern Denmark and northern Germany.\nThe Great Belt was used by now defunct night passenger trains between Copenhagen and Germany, which were too long to fit on the ferries. Day trains on the Copenhagen-Hamburg route first continued to use the Fehmarn Belt ferries, utilising short diesel trains, but now also use the Great Belt route, which potentially allows longer trains to be used, increasing capacity.\nBy 2028, the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link is expected to be complete with much of the international traffic being shifted from the Great Belt Fixed Link. This more direct route will reduce the rail journey from Hamburg to Copenhagen from 4:45 to 3:30 hours.\nCyclists are not permitted to use the bridge, but bicycles may be transported by train or bus.\nToll charge.\nIn 2019, the vehicle tolls were:\nEnvironmental effects.\nEnvironmental considerations have been an integral part of the project, and have been of decisive significance for the choice of alignment and determination of the design. Great Belt A/S established an environmental monitoring programme in 1988, and initiated co-operation with authorities and external consultants on the definition of environmental concerns during the construction work and the professional requirements to the monitoring programme. This co-operation issued in a report published at the beginning of 1997 on the state of the environment in the Great Belt. The conclusion of the report was that the marine environment was at least as good as before construction work began.\nWith regards to the water flow, the link must comply with the so-called zero-solution. This has been achieved by deepening parts of the Great Belt, so that the water flow cross section has been increased. This excavation compensates for the blocking effect caused by the bridge pylons and approach ramps. The conclusion of the report is that water flows are now almost at the level they were before the bridge was built.\nThe fixed link has generated increased road traffic volume, which has meant increased air pollution. However, there has been significant savings in the energy consumption by switching from ferries to the fixed link. Train and car ferries consume much energy for propulsion, high-speed ferries consume large amounts of energy at high speeds, and air transport is highly energy consuming. Domestic air travel over the Great Belt was greatly reduced after the opening of the bridge, with the former air travellers now using trains and private cars.\nThe larger energy consumption by ferries as opposed to via the fixed link is most clearly seen when comparing short driving distances from areas immediately east or west of the link. For more extended driving distances the difference in energy consumption is smaller, but any transport within Denmark across the link shows very clear energy savings.\nDuring 2009, seven large wind turbines, likely Vestas 3\u00a0MW totalling 21\u00a0MW capacity, were erected in the sea north of Sprog\u00f8 to contribute to the electrical demand of the Great Belt Link. Their hub heights are about the same level as the road deck of the suspension bridge. Part of the project was to showcase sea wind at the December 2009 Copenhagen climate meeting.\nAccidents.\nDuring construction 479 work-related accidents were reported, of which 53 resulted in serious injuries or death. Seven workers died as a result of work-related accidents.\nThe West Bridge has been struck by sea traffic twice. While the link was still under construction on 14 September 1993, the ferry M/F Roms\u00f8 drifted off course in bad weather and hit the West Bridge. At 19:17 on 3 March 2005, the 3,500-ton freighter MV Karen Danielsen crashed into the West Bridge 800 metres from Funen. The bridge reopened around 01:30, after the freighter was pulled free and inspectors had found no structural damage to the bridge.\nThe East Bridge has so far been in the clear, although on 16 May 2001, the bridge was closed for 10 minutes as the Cambodian 27,000-ton bulk carrier \"Bella\" was heading straight for one of the anchorage structures. The ship was deflected by a swift response from the navy.\nOn 5 June 2006, a maintenance vehicle burst into flames in the east-bound railway tunnel at about 21:30. Nobody was hurt; its crew of three fled to the other tunnel and escaped. The fire was put out shortly before midnight, and the vehicle was removed from the tunnel the next day. Train service resumed on 6 June at reduced speed, and normal service was restored on 12 June.\nOn 2 January 2019, eight people were killed in a train accident on the West Bridge. A passenger train was hit by a semi-trailer that fell off a freight train travelling in the opposite direction.\nIn 2023, a 57-year-old truck driver was arrested by police after traffic on the bridge was disrupted due to spilled potatoes. Police stated that they were working on the hypothesis that the potatoes were either planted intentionally or as an accident.\nOperations.\nIn 2009, a study characterized the rail tunnel (together with other major projects like the Channel Tunnel between England and France) as financially non-viable.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This is assessed in January of each year. The main factors influencing the Clock are nuclear warfare, climate change, and artificial intelligence. The \"Bulletin\"'s Science and Security Board monitors new developments in the life sciences and technology that could inflict irrevocable harm to humanity.\nThe Clock's original setting in 1947 was 7 minutes to midnight. It has since been set backward 8 times and forward 18 times. The farthest time from midnight was 17 minutes in 1991, and the closest is 89 seconds, set in January 2025.\nThe Clock was moved to 150 seconds (2\u00a0minutes, 30\u00a0seconds) in 2017, then forward to 2 minutes to midnight in 2018, and left unchanged in 2019. It was moved forward to 100 seconds (1\u00a0minute, 40\u00a0seconds) in 2020, 90\u00a0seconds (1\u00a0minute,\u00a030 seconds) in 2023, and 89 seconds (1\u00a0minute,\u00a029 seconds) in 2025.\nHistory.\nThe Doomsday Clock's origin can be traced to the international group of researchers called the Chicago Atomic Scientists, who had participated in the Manhattan Project. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they began publishing a mimeographed newsletter and then the magazine, \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\", which, since its inception, has depicted the Clock on every cover. The Clock was first represented in 1947, when the \"Bulletin\" co-founder Hyman Goldsmith asked artist Martyl Langsdorf (wife of Manhattan Project research associate and Szil\u00e1rd petition signatory Alexander Langsdorf Jr.) to design a cover for the magazine's June 1947 issue. As Eugene Rabinowitch, another co-founder of the \"Bulletin\", explained later:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The \"Bulletin\"'s Clock is not a gauge to register the ups and downs of the international power struggle; it is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age... Langsdorf chose a clock to reflect the urgency of the problem: like a countdown, the Clock suggests that destruction will naturally occur unless someone takes action to stop it.\nIn January 2007, designer Michael Bierut, who was on the \"Bulletin\"'s Governing Board, redesigned the Doomsday Clock to give it a more modern feel. In 2009, the \"Bulletin\" ceased its print edition and became one of the first print publications in the U.S. to become entirely digital; the Clock is now found as part of the logo on the \"Bulletin\"'s website. Information about the Doomsday Clock Symposium, a timeline of the Clock's settings, and multimedia shows about the Clock's history and culture can also be found on the \"Bulletin\"'s website.\nThe 5th Doomsday Clock Symposium was held on November 14, 2013, in Washington, D.C.; it was a day-long event that was open to the public and featured panelists discussing various issues on the topic \"Communicating Catastrophe\". There was also an evening event at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in conjunction with the Hirshhorn's current exhibit, \"Damage Control: Art and Destruction Since 1950\". The panel discussions, held at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, were streamed live from the \"Bulletin\"'s website and can still be viewed there. Reflecting international events dangerous to humankind, the Clock has been adjusted 25 times since its inception in 1947, when it was set to \"seven minutes to midnight\".\nThe Doomsday Clock has become a universally recognized metaphor according to \"The Two-Way\", an NPR blog. According to the \"Bulletin\", the Clock attracts more daily visitors to the \"Bulletin\"'s site than any other feature.\nBasis for settings.\n\"Midnight\" has a deeper meaning besides the constant threat of war. There are various elements taken into consideration when the scientists from the \"Bulletin\" decide what Midnight and \"global catastrophe\" really mean in a particular year. They might include \"politics, energy, weapons, diplomacy, and climate science\"; potential sources of threat include nuclear threats, climate change, bioterrorism, and artificial intelligence. Members of the board judge Midnight by discussing how close they think humanity is to the end of civilization. In 1947, at the beginning of the Cold War, the Clock was started at seven minutes to midnight.\nFluctuations and threats.\nBefore January 2020, the two tied-for-lowest points for the Doomsday Clock were in 1953 (when the Clock was set to two minutes until midnight, after the U.S. and the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs) and in 2018, following the failure of world leaders to address tensions relating to nuclear weapons and climate change issues. In other years, the Clock's time has fluctuated from 17 minutes in 1991 to 2\u00a0minutes 30\u00a0seconds in 2017. Discussing the change in 2017, Lawrence Krauss, one of the scientists from the \"Bulletin\", warned that political leaders must make decisions based on facts, and those facts \"must be taken into account if the future of humanity is to be preserved\". In an announcement from the \"Bulletin\" about the status of the Clock, they went as far to call for action from \"wise\" public officials and \"wise\" citizens to make an attempt to steer human life away from catastrophe while humans still can.\nOn January 24, 2018, scientists moved the clock to two minutes to midnight, based on threats greatest in the nuclear realm. The scientists said, of recent moves by North Korea under Kim Jong-un and the administration of Donald Trump in the U.S.: \"Hyperbolic rhetoric and provocative actions by both sides have increased the possibility of nuclear war by accident or miscalculation\".\nThe clock was left unchanged in 2019 due to the twin threats of nuclear weapons and climate change, and the problem of those threats being \"exacerbated this past year by the increased use of information warfare to undermine democracy around the world, amplifying risk from these and other threats and putting the future of civilization in extraordinary danger\".\nOn January 23, 2020, the Clock was moved to 100 seconds (1 minute, 40 seconds) before midnight. The \"Bulletin\"'s executive chairman, Jerry Brown, said \"the dangerous rivalry and hostility among the superpowers increases the likelihood of nuclear blunder... Climate change just compounds the crisis\". The \"100 seconds to midnight\" setting remained unchanged in 2021 and 2022.\nOn January 24, 2023, the Clock was moved to 90 seconds (1 minute, 30 seconds) before midnight, which was largely attributed to the risk of nuclear escalation that arose from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Other reasons cited included climate change, biological threats such as COVID-19, and risks associated with disinformation and disruptive technologies. \nOn January 28, 2025, the Clock was moved to 89 seconds (1 minute, 29 seconds) before midnight, the closest it has ever been set to midnight since its inception in 1947. In addition to last year's concerns, the increased usage of artificial intelligence in both the battlefield and social media was noted as a new factor.\nCriticism.\nIn 2016, Anders Sandberg of the Future of Humanity Institute has stated that the \"grab bag of threats\" currently mixed together by the Clock can induce paralysis. People may be more likely to succeed at smaller, incremental challenges; for example, taking steps to prevent the accidental detonation of nuclear weapons was a small but significant step towards avoiding nuclear war. Alex Barasch in \"Slate\" argued that \"putting humanity on a permanent, blanket high-alert isn't helpful when it comes to policy or science\" and criticized the \"Bulletin\" for neither explaining nor attempting to quantify their methodology.\nCognitive psychologist Steven Pinker harshly criticized the Doomsday Clock as a political stunt, pointing to the words of its founder that its purpose was \"to preserve civilization by scaring men into rationality\". He stated that it is inconsistent and not based on any objective indicators of security, using as an example its being farther from midnight in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis than in the \"far calmer 2007\". He argued it was another example of humanity's tendency toward historical pessimism, and compared it to other predictions of self-destruction that went unfulfilled.\nConservative media outlets have often criticized the \"Bulletin\" and the Doomsday Clock. Keith Payne wrote 2010 in the \"National Review\" that the Clock overestimated the effects of \"developments in the areas of nuclear testing and formal arms control\". In 2018, Tristin Hopper in the \"National Post\" acknowledged that \"there are plenty of things to worry about regarding climate change\", but states that climate change is not in the same league as total nuclear destruction. In addition, some critics accuse the \"Bulletin\" of pushing a political agenda.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are usually classified along with other sponges in the phylum Porifera, but some researchers consider them sufficiently distinct to deserve their own phylum, Symplasma. Some experts believe that glass sponges are the longest-lived animals on earth; these scientists tentatively estimate a maximum age of up to 15,000 years.\nBiology.\nGlass sponges are relatively uncommon and are mostly found at depths from below sea level. Although the species \"Oopsacas minuta\" has been found in shallow water, others have been found much deeper. They are found in all oceans of the world, although they are particularly common in Antarctic and Northern Pacific waters.\nThey are more-or-less cup-shaped animals, ranging from in height, with sturdy skeletons made of glass-like silica spicules, fused to form a lattice. In some glass sponges such as members of the genus \"Euplectela\", these structures are aided by a protein called glassin. It helps accelerate the production of silicas from the silicic acid absorbed from the surrounding seawater. The body is relatively symmetrical, with a large central cavity that, in many species, opens to the outside through a sieve formed from the skeleton. Some species of glass sponges are capable of fusing together to create reefs or bioherms. They are generally pale in colour, ranging from white to orange.\nMuch of the body is composed of syncitial tissue, extensive regions of multinucleate cytoplasm. The epidermal cells characteristic of other sponges are absent, being replaced by a syncitial net of amoebocytes, through which the spicules penetrate. Unlike other sponges, they do not possess the ability to contract.\nTheir bodies comprises three parts: the inner and outer peripheral trabecular networks and the choanosome, which is used for feeding purposes. The choanosome acts as the mouth for the sponge while the inner and outer canals that meet at the choanosome are passages for the food, creating a consumption path for the sponge.\nAll hexactinellids have the potential to grow to different sizes, but the average maximum growth is estimated to be around 32 centimeters long. Some grow past that length and continue to extend their lengths up to 1 meter. The estimated life expectancy for hexactinellids that grow around 1 meter is approximately 200 years (Plyes).\nGlass sponges possess a unique system for rapidly conducting electrical impulses across their bodies, making it possible for them to respond quickly to external stimuli. In the case \"Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni,\" the sponge uses electrical neuron signaling to detect outside stimuli, such as sediments, and then send a signal through its body system to alert the organism to no longer be actively feeding. Another glass sponge species in the same experiment of \"R. dawsoni\" showed that the electrical conduction system for this class of sponges has its own threshold of how much outside stimuli, sediments, etc., it can endure before it will stop its feeding process. Species like Venus' flower basket have a tuft of fibers that extends outward like an inverted crown at the bases of their skeletons. These fibers are long and about the thickness of a human hair.\nSyncytia.\nBodies of glass sponges are different from those of other sponges in various other ways. For example, most of their cytoplasm is not divided into separate cells by membranes, but forms a syncytium or continuous mass of cytoplasm with many nuclei (e.g., Reiswig and Mackie, 1983); it is held suspended like a cobweb by a scaffolding-like framework made of silica spicules. The remaining cells are connected to the syncytium by bridges of cytoplasmic \"rivers\" that transport nuclei, organelles, and other substances. Instead of choanocytes, these bridges have further syncytia, known as choanosyncytia, which form bell-shaped chambers where water enters via perforations. The insides of these chambers are lined with \"collar bodies\", each consisting of a collar and flagellum but without a nucleus of its own. The motion of the flagella sucks water through passages in the \"cobweb\" and expels it via the open ends of the bell-shaped chambers.\nSome types of cells have a single nucleus and membrane each but are connected to other single-nucleus cells and to the main syncytium by \"bridges\" made of cytoplasm. The sclerocytes that build spicules have multiple nuclei, and in glass sponge larvae they are connected to other tissues by cytoplasm bridges; such connections between sclerocytes have not so far been found in adults, but this may simply reflect the difficulty of investigating such small-scale features. The bridges are controlled by \"plugged junctions\" that apparently permit some substances to pass while blocking others.\nThis physiology is what allows for a greater flow of ions and electrical signals to move throughout the organism, with around 75% of the sponge tissue being fused in this way. Another way is their role in the nutrient cycles of deep-sea environments. One species for example, \"Vazella pourtalesii\", has an abundance of symbiotic microbes which aid in the nitrification and denitrification of their communities. These interactions help the sponges survive in the low-oxygen conditions of the depths.\nLongevity.\nThese creatures are long-lived, but the exact age is hard to measure; one study based on modelling gave an estimated age of a specimen of \"Scolymastra joubini\" as 23,000 years (with a range from 13,000 to 40,000 years). However, due to changes in sea levels since the Last Glacial Maximum, its maximum age is thought to be no more than 15,000 years, hence its listing of c. 15,000 years in the AnAge Database. The shallow-water occurrence of hexactinellids is rare worldwide. In the Antarctic, two species occur as shallow as 33 meters under the ice. In the Mediterranean, one species occurs as shallow as in a cave with deep-water upwelling (Boury-Esnault &amp; Vacelet (1994))\nReefs.\nThe sponges form reefs (called sponge reefs) off the coast of British Columbia, Southeast Alaska, and Washington state, which are studied by the Sponge Reef Project. In the case of \"Sarostegia oculata\", this species almost always hosts symbiotic zoanthids, which cause the hexactinellid sponge to imitate the appearance and structure of coral reefs. Only 33\u00a0species of this sponge were reported in the South Atlantic until 2017 when the submersible \"Shinka\u00a06500\" went on an expedition through the Rio Grande Rise. Reefs discovered in Hecate Strait, British Columbia, have grown to up to long and high. Prior to these discoveries, sponge reefs were thought to have died out in the Jurassic period.\nReports of glass sponges have also been recorded on the wrecks of and off the coast of Vancouver Island. Species of zoantharin that rely on hexactinellids have also been found off the coast of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima (Marcus Island). Unidentified species of zoanthids have also been found in Australian waters; if these are identified as the same as the ones found in Minamitorishima, it could be evidence of hexactinellids existing in all of the Pacific Ocean.\nConservation.\nMost hexactinellids live in deep waters that are not impacted by human activities. However, there are glass-sponge reefs off the coast of British Columbia. The Canadian government designated of the Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound as the Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound Glass Sponge Reefs Marine Protected Area. This area contains four glass sponge reefs. The new regulations prohibit bottom-contact fishing within of the sponge reefs. Although human activities only affect a small portion of glass sponges, they are still subject to the threat of climate change. Experiments using the species \"Aphrocallistes vastus\" have shown that increases in temperature and acidification can lead to weakened skeletal strength and stiffness. In 1995, an Antarctic ice shelf collapsed due to climate change. Since then, studies of the area have shown that hexactinellid reefs have been increasing in size despite the changes in climate.\nEvolution and taxonomy.\nThe earliest known hexactinellids are from the earliest Cambrian or late Neoproterozoic eras; \"Helicolocellus\" is a possible hexactinellid relative from the late Ediacaran. They are fairly common relative to demosponges as fossils, but this is thought to be, at least in part, because their spicules are sturdier than spongin and fossilize better. Like almost all sponges, the hexactinellids draw water in through a series of small pores by the whip-like beating of a series of hairs or flagella in chambers which in this group line the sponge wall.\nThe class is divided into two subclasses and several orders:\nClass Hexactinellida\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It may move any number of squares horizontally or vertically without jumping, and it may &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;capture&lt;/dfn&gt; an enemy piece on its path; it may participate in castling. Each player starts the game with two rooks, one in each corner on their side of the board.\nFormerly, the rook (from ) was alternatively called the \"tower\", \"marquess\", \"rector\", and \"comes\" (\"count\" or \"earl\"). The term \"castle\" is considered to be informal or old-fashioned.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC_left/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlacement and movement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe white rooks start on the squares a1 and h1, while the black rooks start on a8 and h8. The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares. The rook cannot jump over pieces. The rook may capture an enemy piece by moving to the square on which the enemy piece stands, removing it from play. The rook also participates with the king in a special move called castling, wherein it is transferred to the square crossed by the king after the king is shifted two squares toward the rook.\nStrategy.\nRelative value.\nThe rook is worth about five pawns. In general, rooks are stronger than bishops or knights and are considered greater in value than either of those pieces by nearly two pawns, but less valuable than two minor pieces by approximately a pawn. Two rooks are generally considered to be worth slightly more than a queen (see chess piece relative value). Winning a rook for a bishop or knight is referred to as winning \"the exchange\". Rooks and queens are called \"major pieces\" or \"heavy pieces\", as opposed to bishops and knights, the \"minor pieces\".\nDevelopment.\nIn the opening, the rooks are blocked in by other pieces and cannot immediately participate in the game, so it is usually desirable to \"connect\" one's rooks on the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;first rank&lt;/dfn&gt; by castling and then clearing all pieces except the king and rooks from the first rank. In that position, the rooks support each other and can more easily move to occupy and control the most favorable &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;files&lt;/dfn&gt;.\nA common strategic goal is to &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;develop&lt;/dfn&gt; a rook on the first rank of an open file (i.e., one unobstructed by pawns of either player) or a half-open file (i.e., one unobstructed by friendly pawns). From this position, the rook is relatively unexposed to risk but can exert control on every square on the file. If one file is particularly important, a player might advance one rook on it, then position the other rook behind\u2014\"doubling\" the rooks. Having both rooks on the same file is known as a battery and can be very deadly, especially if the queen joins in as well (see Alekhine's Gun).\nA rook on the seventh rank (the opponent's second rank) is typically very powerful, as it threatens the opponent's unadvanced pawns and hems in the enemy king. A rook on the seventh rank is often considered sufficient compensation for a pawn. In the diagrammed position from a game between Lev Polugaevsky and Larry Evans, the rook on the seventh rank enables White to draw, despite being a pawn down.\nTwo rooks on the seventh rank are often enough to force victory by the blind swine mate, or at least a draw by perpetual check.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEndgame.\nRooks are most powerful towards the end of a game (i.e., the endgame), when they can move unobstructed by pawns and control large numbers of squares. They have trouble restraining enemy pawns from advancing towards promotion unless they occupy the file behind them. As well, a rook best supports a friendly pawn towards promotion from behind it on the same file (see Tarrasch rule).\nIn a position with a rook and one or two &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;minor pieces&lt;/dfn&gt; versus two rooks, generally in addition to pawns, and possibly other pieces, Lev Alburt advises that the player with the single rook should avoid exchanging the rook for one of his opponent's rooks.\nThe rook is adept at delivering checkmate. Below are a few examples of rook checkmates that are easy to &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;force&lt;/dfn&gt;. A single rook can force checkmate while a single minor piece cannot.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nIn the medieval shatranj, the rook symbolized a chariot. The Persian word means \"chariot\", as does the name of the corresponding piece in the original Indian version, chaturanga, . In modern times, it is mostly known as (elephant) to Hindi-speaking players, while East Asian chess games such as xiangqi and shogi have names also meaning chariot () for the same piece.\nPersian war chariots were heavily armored, carrying a driver and at least one ranged-weapon bearer, such as an archer. The sides of the chariot were built to resemble fortified stone work, giving the impression of small, mobile buildings, causing terror on the battlefield.\nIn Europe, the castle or tower appears for the first time in the 16th century in Vida's 1550 , and then as a tower on the back of an elephant. In time, the elephant disappeared and only the tower was used as the piece.\nIn the West, the rook is almost universally represented as a crenellated turret. The piece is called (\"tower\") in Italian, Portuguese, Catalan and Spanish; in French; in Dutch; in German; in Swedish; and in Finnish. In Hungarian, it is (\"bastion\") and in Hebrew, it is called (, meaning \"turret\"). In the British Museum's collection of the medieval Lewis chess pieces, the rooks appear as stern warders, or wild-eyed berserker warriors.\nRooks are usually similar in appearance to small castles; thus, a rook is sometimes called a \"castle\", though modern chess literature rarely, if ever, uses this term.\nIn some languages, the rook is called a ship: Thai (), Armenian (), Russian (), Javanese (). This may be because of the use of an Arabic style V-shaped rook piece, which some may have mistaken for a ship. It is possible that the rendition comes from Sanskrit (ship); however, no chaturanga pieces were ever called a . Murray argued that the Javanese could not visualize a chariot moving through the jungles in sweeping fashion as the rook. The only vehicle that moved in straight fashion was a ship, thus they replaced it with . Murray, however, did not give an explanation why the Russians call the piece a \"ship\".\nPeter Tyson suggests that there is a correlation between the name of the piece and the word , a mythical giant bird of prey from Persian mythology.\nIn South Slavic languages, it is called the \"cannon\" ().\nIn Kannada, it is known as (), meaning \"elephant\". This is unusual, as the term for elephant is in many other languages applied to the bishop.\nHeraldry.\n Chess rooks frequently occur as heraldic charges. Heraldic rooks are usually shown as they looked in medieval chess sets, with the usual battlements replaced by two outward-curving horns. They occur in arms from around the 13th\u00a0century onwards.\nIn Canadian heraldry, the chess rook is the cadency mark of a fifth daughter.\nUnicode.\nUnicode defines three codepoints for a rook:\n\u2656 U+2656 White Chess Rook\n\u265c U+265C Black Chess Rook\n\ud83e\ude02 U+1FA02 Neutral Chess Rook\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The starting squares are c1 and f1 for White's bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black's bishops. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC_left/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlacement and movement.\nThe &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;king's bishop&lt;/dfn&gt; is placed on f1 for White and f8 for Black; the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;queen's bishop&lt;/dfn&gt; is placed on c1 for White and c8 for Black.\nThe bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move but is limited to diagonal movement. It cannot jump over other pieces. A bishop captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece stands. As a consequence of its diagonal movement, each bishop always remains on one square color. Owing to this, it is common to refer to a bishop as a \"light-squared\" or \"dark-squared\" bishop.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nComparison \u2013 other pieces.\nVersus rook.\nA rook is generally worth about two pawns more than a bishop. The bishop has access to only half of the squares on the board, whereas all squares of the board are accessible to the rook. When unobstructed, a rook attacks fourteen squares regardless of position, whereas a bishop attacks no more than thirteen (from one of four center squares) and sometimes as few as seven (from sides and corners). A king and rook can &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;force&lt;/dfn&gt; checkmate against a lone king, whereas a king and bishop cannot. A king and two bishops on opposite-colored squares, however, can force mate.\nVersus knight.\nKnights and bishops are each worth about three pawns. This means bishops are approximately equal in strength to knights, but depending on the game situation, either may have a distinct advantage. In general, the bishop is slightly stronger than the knight.\nLess experienced players tend to underrate the bishop compared to the knight because the knight can reach all squares and is more adept at forking. More experienced players understand the power of the bishop.\nBishops usually gain in relative strength towards the endgame as more pieces are captured and more open lines become available on which they can operate. A bishop can easily influence both wings simultaneously, whereas a knight is less capable of doing so. In an open endgame, a pair of bishops is decidedly superior to either a bishop and a knight, or two knights. A player possessing a pair of bishops has a strategic weapon in the form of a long-term threat to trade down to an advantageous endgame.\nTwo bishops on opposite-colored squares and king can force checkmate against a lone king, whereas two knights cannot. A bishop and knight can force mate, but with far greater difficulty than two bishops.\nIn certain positions a bishop can by itself lose a move (see triangulation and tempo), while a knight can never do so. The bishop is capable of skewering or pinning a piece, while the knight can do neither. A bishop can in some situations hinder a knight from moving. In these situations, the bishop is said to be \"dominating\" the knight.\nOn the other hand, in the opening and middlegame a bishop may be hemmed in by pawns of both players, and thus be inferior to a knight which can jump over them. A knight check cannot be blocked but a bishop check can. Furthermore, on a crowded board a knight has many tactical opportunities to fork two enemy pieces. A bishop can fork, but opportunities are rarer. One such example occurs in the position illustrated, which arises from the Ruy Lopez: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 b5 6.Bb3 Be7 7.d4 d6 8.c3 Bg4 9.h3!? Bxf3 10.Qxf3 exd4 11.Qg3 g6 12.Bh6!\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDimensions and design.\n The bishop is the third-tallest piece in chess, often potrayed as the advisor in chess as indicated by its placement next to the king and queen. The design is characterized by a slanted top with a distinctive slit, or \"mitre\" which represents a stylized version of a mitre hat worn by a bishop. This slit is a key feature for distinguishing it from a pawn.\nGame use.\nGood bishop and bad bishop.\nIn the middlegame, a player with only one bishop should generally place friendly pawns on squares of the color that the bishop cannot move to. This allows the player to control squares of both colors, allows the bishop to move freely among the pawns, and helps fix enemy pawns on squares on which they can be attacked by the bishop. Such a bishop is often referred to as a \"good\" bishop.\nConversely, a bishop which is impeded by friendly pawns is often referred to as a \"bad\" bishop (or sometimes, disparagingly, a \"tall pawn\"). The black light-squared bishop in the French Defense is a notorious example of this concept, as playing 1...e6 and 2...d5 results in there being two pawns impeding its ability to join the game. A bad bishop, however, need not always be a weakness, especially if it is outside its own &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;pawn chains&lt;/dfn&gt;. In addition, having a bad bishop may be advantageous in an opposite-colored bishops endgame. Even if the bad bishop is passively placed, it may serve a useful defensive function; a well-known quip from GM Mihai \u0218ub\u0103 is that \"Bad bishops protect good pawns.\"\nIn the position from the game Krasenkow\u2013Zvjaginsev, FIDE World Chess Championship 2004, a thicket of black pawns hems in Black's bishop on c8, so Black is effectively playing with one piece fewer than White. Although the black pawns also obstruct the white bishop on e2, it has many more attacking possibilities, and thus is a good bishop vis-\u00e0-vis Black's bad bishop. Black resigned after another ten moves.\nFianchetto.\nA bishop may be \"fianchettoed\", for example after moving the g2 pawn to g3 and the bishop on f1 to g2. This can form a strong defense for the castled king on g1 and the bishop can often exert strong pressure on the long diagonal (here h1\u2013a8). A fianchettoed bishop should generally not be given up lightly, since the resulting &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;holes&lt;/dfn&gt; in the pawn formation may prove to be serious weaknesses, particularly if the king has castled on that side of the board.\nThere are nonetheless some modern opening lines where a fianchettoed bishop is given up for a knight in order to double the opponent's pawns, for example 1.d4 g6 2.c4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5 4.d5 Bxc3+!? 5.bxc3 f5, a sharp line originated by Roman Dzindzichashvili. Giving up a fianchettoed queen's bishop for a knight is usually less problematic. For example, in Karpov\u2013Browne, San Antonio 1972, after 1.c4 c5 2.b3 Nf6 3.Bb2 g6?!, Karpov gave up his fianchettoed bishop with 4.Bxf6! exf6 5.Nc3, doubling Black's pawns and giving him a hole on d5.\nEndgame.\nAn endgame in which each player has only one bishop, one controlling the dark squares and the other the light, will often result in a draw even if one player has a pawn or sometimes two more than the other. The players tend to gain control of squares of opposite colors, and a deadlock results. In endgames with same-colored bishops, however, even a positional advantage may be enough to win.\nBishops on opposite colors.\nEndgames in which each player has only one bishop (and no other pieces besides the king) and the bishops are on opposite colors are often drawn, even when one side has an extra pawn or two. Many of these positions would be a win if the bishops were on the same color.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe position from the game H. Wolf\u2013P. Leonhardt, 1905 (see diagram) shows an important defensive setup. Black can make no progress, since the white bishop ties the black king to defending the pawn on g4 and it also prevents the advance ...f3+ because it would simply &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;capture&lt;/dfn&gt; the pawn\u00a0\u2013 then either the other pawn is exchanged for the bishop (an immediate draw) or the pawn advances (an easily drawn position). Otherwise the bishop alternates between the squares d1 and e2.\nIf two pawns are connected, they normally win if they reach their sixth &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;rank&lt;/dfn&gt;, otherwise the game may be a draw (as above). If two pawns are separated by one &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;file&lt;/dfn&gt; they usually draw, but win if they are farther apart.\nIn some cases with more pawns on the board, it is actually advantageous to have the bishops on opposite colors if one side has weak pawns. In the 1925 game Efim Bogoljubov\u2013Max Bl\u00fcmich (see diagram), White wins because of the bishops being on opposite colors making Black weak on the dark squares, the weakness of Black's isolated pawns on the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;queenside&lt;/dfn&gt;, and the weak doubled pawns on the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;kingside&lt;/dfn&gt;. The game continued:\n29.Kd2 Ke7 30.Kc3 f6 31.Kd4 Be6 32.Kc5 Kd7 33.Kb6 g5 34.Kxa6 Kc7 35.Bb6+ Kc8 36.Bc5 Kc7 37.Bf8 f5 38.Bxg7 f4 39.Bf6 f3 40.gxf3 exf3 41.Bxg5 Bxh3 42.Bf4+ 1\u20130\nWrong bishop.\nIn an endgame with a bishop, in some cases the bishop is the \"wrong bishop\", meaning that it is on the wrong color of square for some purpose (usually promoting a pawn). For example, with just a bishop and a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;rook pawn&lt;/dfn&gt;, if the bishop cannot control the promotion square of the pawn, it is said to be the \"wrong bishop\" or the pawn is said to be the wrong rook pawn. This results in some positions being drawn (by setting up a fortress) which otherwise would be won.\nHistory.\nThe bishop's predecessor in medieval chess, shatranj (originally chaturanga), was the alfil, meaning \"elephant\", which could leap two squares along any diagonal, and could jump over an intervening piece. As a consequence, each fil was restricted to eight squares, and no fil could attack another. The modern bishop first appeared shortly after 1200 in Courier chess. A piece with this move, called a or crocodile, is part of the Grande Acedrex in the compiled in 1283 for King Alfonso X of Castile. The game is attributed to \"India\", then a very vague term. About half a century later Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ma\u1e25mud al-\u0100mul\u012b, in his \"Treasury of the Sciences\", describes an expanded form of chess with two pieces moving \"like the rook but obliquely\". The bishop was also independently invented in Japan at about the same time (the 13th\u00a0century), where it formed part of sho shogi and dai shogi; it remains present in modern shogi as the direct descendant of sho shogi.\nDerivatives of \"alfil\" survive in the languages of the two countries where chess was first introduced within Western Europe\u2014Italian () and Spanish (). It was known as the in French, or the aufin, alphin, or archer in early English.\nThe earliest references to bishops on the chessboard are two 13th-century Latin texts, and . The etymology of \"bishop\" comes from Old English bisceop \"bishop, high priest,\" from Late Latin episcopus, from Greek episkopos \"watcher, overseer.\" The term \"bishop\" as applied specifically to the chess piece was first recorded in the 16th century, with the first known written example dating back to the 1560s. In all other Germanic languages, except for Icelandic, it is called various names, all of which directly translate to English as \"runner\" or \"messenger\". In Icelandic, however, it is called \", with the same meaning as in English. The use of the term in Icelandic predates that of the English language, as the first mentioning of \" in Icelandic texts dates back to the early part of the 14th\u00a0century, while the 12th-century Lewis Chessmen portray the bishop as an unambiguously ecclesiastical figure. In the \"Saga of Earl M\u00e1gus\", which was written in Iceland somewhere between 1300 and 1325, it is described how an emperor was checkmated by a bishop. This has led to some speculations as to the origin of the English use of the term \"bishop\".\nThe canonical chessmen date back to the Staunton chess set of 1849. The piece's deep groove symbolizes a bishop's (or abbot's) mitre. Some have written that the groove originated from the original form of the piece, an elephant with the groove representing the elephant's tusks. The English apparently chose to call the piece a bishop because the projections at the top resembled a mitre. This groove was interpreted differently in different countries as the game moved to Europe; in France, for example, the groove was taken to be a jester's cap, hence in France the bishop is called (jester) and in Romania (meaning crazy, but also jester).\nIn some Slavic languages (e.g. Czech/Slovak) the bishop is called \"st\u0159elec/strelec\", which directly translates to English as a \"shooter\" meaning an archer, while in others it is still known as \"elephant\" (e.g. Russian ). In South Slavic languages it is usually known as \"lovac\", meaning \"hunter\", or \"laufer\", taken from the German name for the same piece (\"laufer\" is also a co-official Polish name for the piece alongside \"goniec\"). In Bulgarian the bishop is called \"officer\" (), which is also the piece's alternative name in Russian; it is also called () in Greek, () in Belarusian and \"oficeri\" in Albanian.\nIn Mongolian and several Indian languages it is called the \"camel\".\nIn Lithuanian it is the \", a kind of military commander in medieval Lithuania.\nIn Latvia it is known as \", a term for the wooden handle part of some firearms.\nUnicode.\nUnicode defines three codepoints for a bishop:\n\u2657 U+2657 White Chess Bishop\n\u265d U+265D Black Chess Bishop\n\ud83e\ude03 U+1FA03 Neutral Chess Bishop\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can be either white or black, and it can be one of six types: king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, or pawn.\nChess sets generally come with sixteen pieces of each color. Additional pieces, usually an extra queen per color, may be provided for use in promotion or handicap games.\nNumber.\nEach player begins with sixteen pieces (but see the subsection below for other usage of the term \"piece\"). The pieces that belong to each player are distinguished by color: the lighter colored pieces are referred to as \"white\" and the player that controls them as \"White\", whereas the darker colored pieces are referred to as \"black\" and the player that controls them as \"Black\".\nIn a standard game, each of the two players begins with the following sixteen pieces:\nDefinitions.\nThe word \"piece\" has three meanings, depending on the context.\nMoves.\nThe rules of chess prescribe the moves each type of chess piece can make. During play, the players take turns moving their own chess pieces.\nPieces other than pawns capture in the same way that they move. A capturing piece replaces the opponent piece on its square, except for an \"en passant\" capture by a pawn. Captured pieces are immediately removed from the game. A square may hold only one piece at any given time. Except for castling and the knight's move, no piece may jump over another piece.\nRelative value.\nThe value assigned to a piece attempts to represent the potential strength of the piece in the game. As the game develops, the relative values of the pieces will also change. For example, in an &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;open game&lt;/dfn&gt;, bishops are relatively more valuable; they can be positioned to control long, open diagonal spaces. In a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;closed game&lt;/dfn&gt; with lines of protected pawns blocking bishops, knights usually become relatively more potent. Similar ideas apply to placing rooks on open files and knights on active, &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;central squares&lt;/dfn&gt;. The standard valuation is one point for a pawn, three points for a knight or bishop, five points for a rook, and nine points for a queen. These values are reliable in endgames, particularly with a limited number of pieces. But these values can change depending on the position or the phase of the game (opening, middle game, or ending). A &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;bishop pair&lt;/dfn&gt; for example, is worth an additional half-pawn on average. In specific circumstances, the values may be quite different: sometimes a knight can be more valuable than a queen if a particular angle is required for a mating attack, such as certain smothered mates. The humble pawn becomes more and more valuable the closer it is to securing a queen promotion for another example.\nManufacture.\nChess sets have been made in a variety of styles, sometimes for decorative or artistic purposes rather than practical play, but the Staunton pattern is standard for competition.\nHistory.\nChess evolved over time from its earliest versions in India and Persia to variants that spread both West and East. Pieces changed names and rules as well; the most notable changes was the Vizir (or Firz) becoming the Queen, and the Elephant becoming the Bishop in European versions of chess. The movement patterns for Queens and Bishops also changed, with the earliest rules restricting elephants to just two squares along a diagonal, but allowing them to \"jump\" (seen in the fairy chess piece the alfil); and the earliest versions of queens could only move a single square diagonally (the fairy chess piece Ferz). The modern bishop's movement was popularized in the 14th and 15th centuries, and the modern queen was popularized in the 15th and 16th centuries, with versions with the more powerful modern queen eclipsing older variants.\nNames.\nThe characters implied by pieces' names vary between languages. For example, in many languages, the piece known in English as the \"knight\" frequently translates as \"horse\", and the English \"bishop\" frequently translates as \"elephant\" in language areas that adapted the modern bishop's movement pattern, but not its new name.\nVariants.\nChess variants sometimes include new, non-standard, or even old pieces. For example, Courier Chess, a predecessor of modern chess dating from the 12th century, was played on an 8\u00d712 board and used all six modern chess piece types, plus three additional types of pieces: Courier, Mann (or \"rath\" or \"sage\"), and Jester. Variants of \"old\" chess might use the old rules for bishops/elephants with the alfil piece, or old rules for Queens with the ferz. Many modern variants with unorthodox pieces exist, such as Berolina chess which uses custom pawns that advance diagonally and capture vertically.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47619", "revid": "27318187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47619", "title": "Knight (chess)", "text": "Chess piece\nThe knight (\u2658, \u265e) is a piece in the game of chess. It moves two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically, jumping over other pieces. Each player starts the game with two knights on the b- and g-&lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;files&lt;/dfn&gt;, each located between a rook and a bishop.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC_left/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMovement.\nCompared to other chess pieces, the knight's movement is unique: it moves two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of a capital L). Consequently, a knight alternates between light and dark squares with each move. When moving, the knight can jump over pieces to reach its destination. Knights capture in the same way, replacing the enemy piece on the square and removing it from the board. A knight can have up to eight available moves at once. Knights and pawns are the only pieces that can be moved in the chess starting position.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nValue.\nKnights and bishops, also known as &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;minor pieces&lt;/dfn&gt;, have a value of about three pawns. Bishops utilize a longer range, but they can move only to squares of one color. The knight's value increases in &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;closed positions&lt;/dfn&gt; since it can jump over blockades. Knights and bishops are stronger when supported by other pieces (such as pawns) to create outposts and become more powerful when they advance, as long as they remain &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;active&lt;/dfn&gt;. Generally, knights are strongest in the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;center&lt;/dfn&gt; of the board, where they have up to eight moves, and weakest in a corner, where they have only two.\nProperties.\nEnemy pawns are effective at harassing knights because a pawn attacking a knight is not itself attacked by the knight and, because a pawn is worth less than a knight, it does not matter if the knight is defended. For this reason, a knight is effective when placed in a weakness in the opponent's pawn structure, i.e. a square which cannot be attacked by enemy pawns. In the diagram, White's knight on d5 is very powerful\u00a0\u2013 more powerful than Black's bishop on g7.\nWhereas two bishops cover each other's weaknesses, two knights tend not to cooperate with each other as efficiently. As such, a pair of bishops is usually considered better than a pair of knights. World Champion Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca considered that a queen and a knight is usually a better combination than a queen and a bishop. However, Glenn Flear found no game of Capablanca's that supported his statement; statistics do not support the statement, either. In an endgame without other pieces or pawns, two knights generally have a better chance of forming a drawing fortress against a queen than do two bishops or a bishop and a knight.\nCompared to a bishop, a knight is often not as good in an endgame. A knight can exert control over only one part of the board at a time and often takes multiple moves to reposition to a new location, which often makes it less suitable in endgames with pawns on both sides of the board. This limitation is less important, however, in endgames with pawns on only one side of the board. Knights are superior to bishops in an endgame if all the pawns are on one side of the board. Furthermore, knights have the advantage of being able to control squares of either color, unlike a lone bishop. Nonetheless, a disadvantage of the knight (compared to the other pieces) is that by itself it cannot lose a move to put the opponent in zugzwang (see triangulation and tempo), while a bishop can. In the study by Salvio, if the knight is on a black square and it is White's turn to move, White cannot win. Similarly, if the knight were on a white square and it were Black's turn to move, White cannot win. In the other two cases, White would win. If instead of the knight, White had a bishop on either color of square, White would win with either side to move.\nIn an endgame where one side has only a king and a knight while the other side has only a king, the game is a draw since a checkmate is impossible. When a lone king faces a king and two knights, a checkmate can never be &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;forced&lt;/dfn&gt;; checkmate can occur only if the opponent commits a blunder by moving their king to a square where it can be checkmated on the next move. Checkmate can be forced with a bishop and knight, however, or with two bishops, even though the bishop and knight are in general about equal in value. Paradoxically, checkmate with two knights sometimes can be forced if the weaker side has a single extra pawn, but this is a curiosity of little practical value (see two knights endgame). Pawnless endgames are a rarity, and if the stronger side has even a single pawn, an extra knight should give them an easy win. A bishop can trap (although it cannot then capture) a knight on the rim (see diagram), especially in the endgame.\nStamma's mate.\nIn a few rare endgame positions where the opposing king is trapped in a corner in front of its own pawn, it is possible to force mate with only a king and knight in a pattern known as Stamma's mate, which has occasionally been seen in practice. In the position below, from Nogueiras\u2013Gongora, Cuban championship 2001, Black played 75...Nxf6??, incorrectly assuming that the ending would be drawn following the capture of the last white pawn on a2. (Correct was 75...Ne3! 76.Kg6 Ng4 77.Kg7 and now 77...Nxf6! may be safely played, the king being sufficiently distant). Play continued 76.Nxf6 Ke5 77.Nd7+ Kd4 78.Kf4 Kc3 79.Ke3 Kb2 80.Kd2 Kxa2 81.Kc2 Ka1 82.Nc5 Ka2 83.Nd3 Ka1 84.Nc1 and Black resigned, as 84...a2 85.Nb3 is mate.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotation.\nIn algebraic notation, the usual modern way of recording chess games, the letter \"N\" stands for the knight (\"K\" is reserved for the king); in descriptive chess notation, \"Kt\" is sometimes used instead, mainly in older literature. In chess problems and endgame studies, the letter \"S\", standing for \"Springer\", the German name for the piece, is often used (and in some variants of fairy chess, \"N\" is used for the nightrider, a popular fairy chess piece).\nHistory.\nThe knight has the oldest defined movement of any chess piece. It was first introduced in the Indian game of chaturanga around the 6th\u00a0century; it has not changed since.\nVariants.\nPieces similar to the knight are found in almost all games of the chess family. The \"ma\" of xiangqi and janggi is slightly more restricted; conceptually, the piece is considered to pass through the adjacent orthogonal point, which must be unoccupied, rather than \"jumping\". It is therefore possible to block an attack by a \"ma\" by moving a piece adjacent to it. Another related piece is the \"keima\" of shogi, which moves like a knight but can move only two squares forward followed by one square sideways, restricting its movement to two possible squares.\nNames.\nThe knight is colloquially sometimes referred to as a \"horse\", which is also the translation of the piece's name in several languages: Spanish \"caballo\", Italian \"cavallo\", Russian \"\u043a\u043e\u043d\u044c\", etc. Some languages refer to it as the \"jumper\", reflecting the knight's ability to move over pieces in its path: Polish \"skoczek\", Danish/Norwegian \"springer\", Swedish \"springare\", German \"Springer\", Luxembourgish \"Spr\u00e9nger\", Slovene \"skaka\u010d\". In Sicilian it is called \"sceccu\", a slang term for a donkey, derived from the Arabic \"sheikh\", who during the Islamic period rode from village to village on donkeys collecting taxes.\nIn mathematics.\nThe knight is relevant in some mathematical problems. For example, the knight's tour problem is the problem of finding a series of moves by a knight on a chessboard in which every square is visited exactly once.\nKnight variations.\nEven among sets of the standard Staunton pattern, the style of the pieces varies. The knights vary considerably. Here are some examples.\nUnicode.\nUnicode defines three codepoints for a knight:\n\u2658 U+2658 White Chess Knight\n\u265e U+265E Black Chess Knight\n\ud83e\ude04 U+1FA04 Neutral Chess Knight\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the seventh House speaker as well as the ninth secretary of state. Clay unsuccessfully ran for president in the 1824, 1832, and 1844 elections. He helped found both the National Republican Party and the Whig Party. For his role in defusing sectional crises, he earned the appellation of the \"Great Compromiser\" and was part of the \"Great Triumvirate\" of Congressmen, alongside fellow Whig Daniel Webster and Democrat John C. Calhoun.\nClay was born in Hanover County, Virginia, in 1777, and began his legal career in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1797. As a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, he won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. Clay was chosen as Speaker of the House in early 1811 and, along with President James Madison, led the United States into the War of 1812 against Great Britain. In 1814, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Ghent, which brought an end to the War of 1812, and then after the war, Clay returned to his position as Speaker of the House and developed the American System, which called for federal infrastructure investments, support for the national bank, and high protective tariff rates. During 1820, Clay helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over slavery for many years by leading the passage of the Missouri Compromise. He finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate 1824\u20131825 presidential election and used his position as speaker to help John Quincy Adams win the contingent election held to select the president. President Adams then appointed him to the prestigious position of Secretary of State. As a result, critics alleged that the two had agreed to a \"corrupt bargain\".\nAdams was defeated by Democrat Andrew Jackson in the bitter 1828 presidential election. Clay won election to the U.S. Senate in 1831 and ran as the National Republican nominee in the 1832 presidential election. Clay was defeated decisively by President Jackson primarily due to his support for the national bank, which Jackson vehemently opposed. After the 1832 election, Clay helped bring an end to the nullification crisis by leading passage of the Tariff of 1833. During Jackson's second term, opponents of the president including Clay, Webster, and William Henry Harrison created the Whig Party, and through the years, Clay became a leading congressional Whig.\nClay sought the presidency in the 1840 election but was passed over at the Whig National Convention in favor of Harrison. When Harrison died and his vice president John Tyler ascended to office in 1841, Clay clashed with Tyler, who broke with Clay and other congressional Whigs. Clay resigned from the Senate in 1842 and won the 1844 Whig presidential nomination, but he was narrowly defeated in the general election by Democrat James K. Polk, who made the annexation of the Republic of Texas his top issue. Clay strongly criticized the subsequent Mexican\u2013American War and sought the Whig presidential nomination in 1848 but was passed over in favor of General Zachary Taylor who went on to win the election. After returning to the Senate in 1849, Clay played a key role in passing the Compromise of 1850, which postponed a crisis over the status of slavery in the territories. Clay was one of the most important and influential political figures of his era.\nEarly life.\nHenry Clay was born on April 12, 1777, at the Clay homestead in Hanover County, Virginia. He was the seventh of nine children born to the Reverend John Clay and Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Hudson) Clay. Almost all of Henry's older siblings died before adulthood. His father, a Baptist minister nicknamed \"Sir John\", died in 1781, leaving Henry and his brothers two enslaved individuals each; he also left his wife 18 slaves and of land. Clay was of entirely English descent; his ancestor, John Clay, settled in Virginia in 1613. The Clay family became a well-known political family including three other US senators, numerous state politicians, and Clay's cousin Cassius Clay, a prominent anti-slavery activist active in the mid-19th century.\nThe British raided Clay's home shortly after the death of his father, leaving the family in a precarious economic position. However, the widow Elizabeth Clay married Captain Henry Watkins, a successful planter and cousin to John Clay. Elizabeth would have seven more children with Watkins, bearing a total of sixteen children. Watkins became a kind and supportive stepfather and Clay had a very good relationship with him. After his mother's remarriage, the young Clay remained in Hanover County, where he learned how to read and write. In 1791, Watkins moved the family to Kentucky, joining his brother in the pursuit of fertile new lands in the West. However, Clay did not follow, as Watkins secured his temporary employment in a Richmond emporium, with the promise that Clay would receive the next available clerkship at the Virginia Court of Chancery.\nAfter Clay had worked at the Richmond emporium for a year, he obtained a clerkship that had become available at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his handwriting earned him the attention of College of William &amp; Mary professor George Wythe, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, mentor of Thomas Jefferson, and judge on Virginia's High Court of Chancery. Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and amanuensis, a role in which Clay would remain for four years. Clay began to read law under Wythe's mentorship. Wythe had a powerful effect on Clay's worldview, with Clay embracing Wythe's belief that the example of the United States could help spread human freedom around the world. Wythe subsequently arranged a position for Clay with Virginia attorney general Robert Brooke, with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay's legal studies. After completing his studies under Brooke, Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1797.\nMarriage and family.\nOn April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart (1781\u20131864) at the Hart home in Lexington, Kentucky. Her father, Colonel Thomas Hart, was an early settler of Kentucky and a prominent businessman. Hart proved to be an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature. Hart was the namesake and grand-uncle of Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton and was also related to James Brown, a prominent Louisiana politician, and Isaac Shelby, the first governor of Kentucky. Henry Clay was an active Freemason, and served as worshipful master of Lexington lodge No.1 in 1801. Henry and Lucretia would remain married until his death in 1852; she lived until 1864, dying at the age of 83. Both are buried at Lexington Cemetery.\nClay and Lucretia had eleven children (six daughters and five sons): Henrietta (born in 1800), Theodore (1802), Thomas (1803), Susan (1805), Anne (1807), Lucretia (1809), Henry Jr. (1811), Eliza (1813), Laura (1815), James (1817), and John (1821). By 1835, all six daughters had died of varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young mothers. Henry Jr. was killed while commanding a regiment at the Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican\u2013American War. Clay's oldest son, Theodore Wythe Clay, spent the second half of his life confined to a psychiatric hospital. When a young child, Theodore was injured by a blow to his head that fractured his skull. As he grew older his condition devolved into insanity, and from 1831 until his death in 1870 he was confined to an asylum in Lexington. Thomas (who had served some jail time in Philadelphia in 1829\u20131830) became a successful farmer, James established a legal practice (and later served in Congress), and John (who in his mid-20s was also confined to the asylum for a short time) became a successful horse breeder.\nClay was greatly interested in gambling, although he favored numerous restrictions and legal limitations on it. Famously, he once won $40,000 (approximately $970,000 as of 2020). Clay asked for $500 (approximately $12,000 today) and waived the remainder of the debt. Shortly afterward, Clay fell into a debt of $60,000 (approximately $1.5\u00a0million today) while gambling with the same man, who then asked for the $500 back and waived the rest of the debt.\nThey initially lived in Lexington, but in 1804 they began building a plantation outside of Lexington known as Ashland. The Ashland estate eventually encompassed over , with numerous outbuildings such as a smokehouse, a greenhouse, and several barns. There were 122 enslaved people at the estate during Clay's lifetime, with about 50 people needed for farming and the household. He planted crops such as corn, wheat, and rye, as well as hemp, the chief crop of the Bluegrass region. Clay also took a strong interest in thoroughbred racing and imported livestock such as Arabian horses, Maltese donkeys, and Hereford cattle. Though Clay suffered some financial issues during economic downturns, he never fell deeply into debt and ultimately left his children a large inheritance. After the deaths of Anne and Susan, Clay and Lucretia raised several grandchildren at Ashland.\nEarly career in law and politics.\nLegal career.\nIn November 1797, Clay relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, near where his parents and siblings resided. The Bluegrass region, with Lexington at its center, had quickly grown in the preceding decades but had only recently stopped being under the threat of Native American raids. Lexington was an established town that hosted Transylvania University, the first university west of the Appalachian Mountains. Having already passed the Virginia Bar, Clay quickly received a Kentucky license to practice law. After apprenticing himself to Kentucky attorneys such as George Nicholas, John Breckenridge, and James Brown, Clay established his own law practice, frequently working on debt collections and land disputes. Clay soon established a reputation for strong legal ability and courtroom oratory. In 1805, he was appointed to the faculty of Transylvania University where he taught, among others, future Kentucky Governor Robert P. Letcher and Robert Todd, the future father-in-law of Abraham Lincoln.\nClay's client Aaron Burr was indicted for treason in the Burr conspiracy. Clay and his law partner John Allen successfully defended Burr without a fee in 1807. Thomas Jefferson later convinced Clay that Burr had been guilty of the charges. Clay's legal practice was light after his election to Congress. In the 1823 case \"Green v. Biddle\", Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first amicus curiae. However, he lost that case.\nEarly political career.\nClay entered politics shortly after arriving in Kentucky. In his first political speech, he attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts, laws passed by Federalists to suppress dissent during the Quasi-War with France. Like most Kentuckians, Clay was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, but he clashed with state party leaders over a state constitutional convention. Using the pseudonym \"Scaevola\" (in reference to Gaius Mucius Scaevola), Clay advocated for direct elections for Kentucky elected officials and the gradual emancipation of slavery in Kentucky. The 1799 Kentucky Constitution included the direct election of public officials, but the state did not adopt Clay's plan for gradual emancipation.\nIn 1803, Clay won election to the Kentucky House of Representatives. His first legislative initiative was the partisan gerrymander of Kentucky's Electoral College districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for President Jefferson in the 1804 presidential election. Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass region, and he unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from Frankfort to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed populist firebrand Felix Grundy, and he helped defeat Grundy's effort to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company. He advocated for the construction of internal improvements, which would become a consistent theme throughout his public career. Clay's influence in Kentucky state politics was such that in 1806 the Kentucky legislature elected him to the United States Senate. During his two-month tenure in the Senate, Clay advocated for the construction of various bridges and canals, including a canal connecting the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River.\nAfter Clay returned to Kentucky in 1807, he was elected as the speaker of the state house of representatives. That same year, in response to attacks on American shipping by Britain and France during the Napoleonic Wars, President Jefferson arranged passage of the Embargo Act of 1807. In support of Jefferson's policy, which limited trade with foreign powers, Clay introduced a resolution to require legislators to wear homespun suits rather than those made of imported British broadcloth. The vast majority of members of the state house voted for the measure, but Humphrey Marshall, an \"aristocratic lawyer who possessed a sarcastic tongue,\" voted against it. In early 1809, Clay challenged Marshall to a duel, which took place on January 19. While many contemporary duels were called off or fought without the intention of killing one another, both Clay and Marshall fought the duel with the intent of killing their opponent. They each had three turns to shoot; both were hit by bullets, but both survived. Clay quickly recovered from his injury and received only a minor censure from the Kentucky legislature.\nIn 1810, U.S. Senator Buckner Thruston resigned to accept appointment to a position as a federal judge, and Clay was selected by the legislature to fill Thruston's seat. Clay quickly emerged as a fierce critic of British attacks on American shipping, becoming part of an informal group of \"war hawks\" who favored expansionist policies. He also advocated the annexation of West Florida, which was controlled by Spain. On the insistence of the Kentucky legislature, Clay helped prevent the re-charter of the First Bank of the United States, arguing that it interfered with state banks and infringed on states' rights. After serving in the Senate for one year, Clay decided that he disliked the rules of the Senate and instead sought election to the United States House of Representatives. He won election unopposed in late 1810.\nSpeaker of the House.\nElection and leadership.\nThe 1810\u20131811 elections produced many young, anti-British members of Congress who, like Clay, supported going to war with Great Britain. Buoyed by the support of fellow war hawks, Clay was elected Speaker of the House for the 12th Congress. At 34, he was the youngest person to become speaker, a distinction he held until 1839, when 30-year-old Robert M. T. Hunter took office. He was also the first of only two new members elected speaker to date, the other being William Pennington in 1860.\nBetween 1810 and 1824, Clay was elected to seven terms in the House. His tenure was interrupted from 1814 to 1815 when he was a commissioner to peace talks with the British in Ghent, United Netherlands to end the War of 1812, and from 1821 to 1823, when he left Congress to rebuild his family's fortune in the aftermath of the Panic of 1819. Elected speaker six times, Clay's cumulative tenure in office of 10 years, 196 days, is the second-longest, surpassed only by Sam Rayburn.\nAs speaker, Clay wielded considerable power in making committee appointments, and like many of his predecessors he assigned his allies to important committees. Clay was exceptional in his ability to control the legislative agenda through well-placed allies and the establishment of new committees and departed from precedent by frequently taking part in floor debates. Yet he also gained a reputation for personal courteousness and fairness in his rulings and committee appointments. Clay's drive to increase the power of the office of speaker was aided by President James Madison, who deferred to Congress in most matters. John Randolph, a member of the Democratic-Republican Party but also a member of the \"tertium quids\" group that opposed many federal initiatives, emerged as a prominent opponent of Speaker Clay. While Randolph frequently attempted to obstruct Clay's initiatives, Clay became a master of parliamentary maneuvers that enabled him to advance his agenda even over the attempted obstruction by Randolph and others.\nMadison administration, 1811\u20131817.\nClay and other war hawks demanded that the British revoke the Orders in Council, a series of decrees that had resulted in a de facto commercial war with the United States. Though Clay recognized the dangers inherent in fighting Britain, one of the most powerful countries in the world, he saw it as the only realistic alternative to a humiliating submission to British attacks on American shipping. Clay led a successful effort in the House to declare war against Britain, complying with a request from President Madison. Madison signed the declaration of war on June 18, 1812, beginning the War of 1812. During the war, Clay frequently communicated with Secretary of State James Monroe and Secretary of War William Eustis, though he advocated for the replacement of the latter. The war started poorly for the Americans, and Clay lost friends and relatives in the fighting. In October 1813, the British asked Madison to begin negotiations in Europe, and Madison asked Clay to join his diplomatic team, as the president hoped that the presence of the leading war hawk would ensure support for a peace treaty. Clay was reluctant to leave Congress but felt duty-bound to accept the offer, and so he resigned from Congress on January 19, 1814.\nClay left the country on February 25, but negotiations with the British did not begin until August 1814. Clay was part of a team of five commissioners that included Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin, Senator James Bayard, ambassador Jonathan Russell, and ambassador John Quincy Adams, the head of the American team. Clay and Adams maintained an uneasy relationship marked by frequent clashes, and Gallatin emerged as the unofficial leader of the American team. When the British finally presented their initial peace offer, Clay was outraged by its terms, especially the British proposal for an Indian barrier state on the Great Lakes. After a series of American military successes in 1814, the British delegation made several concessions and offered a better peace deal. While Adams and Gallatin were eager to make peace as quickly as possible even if that required sub-optimal terms in the peace treaty, Clay believed that the British, worn down by years of fighting against France, greatly desired peace with the United States. Partly due to Clay's hard-line stance, the Treaty of Ghent included relatively favorable terms for the United States, essentially re-establishing the \"status quo ante bellum\" between Britain and the U.S. The treaty was signed on December 24, 1814, bringing a close to the War of 1812. After the signing of the treaty, Clay briefly traveled to London, where he helped Gallatin negotiate a commercial agreement with Britain.\nClay returned to the United States in September 1815; despite his absence, he had been elected to another term in the House of Representatives. Upon his return to Congress, Clay won election as Speaker of the House. The War of 1812 strengthened Clay's support for interventionist economic policies such as federally funded internal improvements, which he believed were necessary to improve the country's infrastructure system. He eagerly embraced President Madison's ambitious domestic package, which included infrastructure investment, tariffs to protect domestic manufacturing, and spending increases for the army and navy. With the help of John C. Calhoun and William Lowndes, Clay passed the Tariff of 1816, which served the dual purpose of raising revenue and protecting American manufacturing. To stabilize the currency, Clay and Treasury Secretary Alexander Dallas arranged passage of a bill establishing the Second Bank of the United States (also known as the national bank). Clay also supported the Bonus Bill of 1817, which would have provided a fund for internal improvements, but Madison vetoed the bill on constitutional concerns. Beginning in 1818, Clay advocated for an economic plan known as the \"American System,\" which encompassed many of the economic measures, including protective tariffs and infrastructure investments, that he helped pass in the aftermath of the War of 1812.\nMonroe administration, 1817\u20131825.\nLike Jefferson and George Washington, President Madison decided to retire after two terms, leaving open the Democratic-Republican nomination for the 1816 presidential election. At the time, the Democratic-Republicans used a congressional nominating caucus to choose their presidential nominees, giving congressmen a powerful role in the presidential selection process. Monroe and Secretary of War William Crawford emerged as the two main candidates for the Democratic-Republican nomination. Clay had a favorable opinion of both individuals, but he supported Monroe, who won the nomination and went on to defeat Federalist candidate Rufus King in the general election. Monroe offered Clay the position of secretary of war, but Clay strongly desired the office of secretary of state and was angered when Monroe instead chose John Quincy Adams for that position. Clay became so bitter that he refused to allow Monroe's inauguration to take place in the House Chamber and subsequently did not attend Monroe's outdoor inauguration. \nIn early 1819, a dispute erupted over the proposed statehood of Missouri after New York Congressman James Tallmadge Jr. introduced a legislative amendment that would provide for the gradual emancipation of Missouri's enslaved people. Though Clay had previously called for gradual emancipation in Kentucky, he sided with fellow Southerners in voting down Tallmadge's amendment. Clay instead supported Illinois Senator Jesse B. Thomas's compromise proposal in which Missouri would be admitted as a slave state, Maine would be admitted as a free state, and slavery would be forbidden in the territories north of 36\u00b0 30' parallel. Clay helped assemble a coalition that passed the Missouri Compromise, as Thomas's proposal became known. Further controversy ensued when Missouri's constitution banned free blacks from entering the state, but Clay was able to engineer another compromise that allowed Missouri to join as a state in August 1821.\nIn foreign policy, Clay was a leading American supporter of the independence movements and revolutions that broke out in Latin America beginning in 1810. Clay frequently called on the Monroe administration to recognize the fledgling Latin American republics, but Monroe feared that doing so would derail his plans to acquire Spanish Florida. In 1818, General Andrew Jackson crossed into Spanish Florida to suppress raids by Seminole Indians. Though Jackson was following Monroe's implied wishes in entering Florida, he created additional controversy in seizing the Spanish town of Pensacola. Despite protests from Secretary of War Calhoun, Monroe and Adams decided to support Jackson's actions in the hope that they would convince Spain to sell Florida. Clay, however, was outraged, and he publicly condemned Jackson's decision to hang two foreign nationals without a trial. Before the House chamber, he compared Jackson to military dictators of the past, telling his colleagues \"that Greece had her Alexander, Rome her Caesar, England her Cromwell, France her Bonaparte, and, that if we would escape the rock on which they split, we must avoid their errors.\" Jackson saw Clay's protestations as an attack on his character and thus began a long rivalry between Clay and Jackson. The rivalry and the controversy over Jackson's expedition temporarily subsided after the signing of the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, in which the U.S. purchased Florida and delineated its western boundary with New Spain.\n1824 presidential election.\nBy 1822, several members of the Democratic-Republican Party had begun exploring presidential bids to succeed Monroe, who planned to retire after two terms like his predecessors. As the Federalist Party was near collapse, the 1824 presidential election would be contested only by members of the Democratic-Republican Party, including Clay. Having led the passage of the Tariff of 1824 and the General Survey Act, Clay campaigned on his American System of high tariffs and federal spending on infrastructure. Three members of Monroe's Cabinet, Secretary of the Treasury William Crawford, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, and Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, appeared to be Clay's strongest competitors for the presidency. Though many, including Clay, did not take his candidacy seriously at first, General Andrew Jackson emerged as a presidential contender, eroding Clay's base of support in the western states. In February 1824, the sparsely attended Democratic-Republican congressional caucus endorsed Crawford's candidacy, but Crawford's rivals ignored the caucus results, and various state legislatures nominated candidates for president. During the campaign, Crawford suffered a major stroke, while Calhoun withdrew from the race after Jackson won the endorsement of the Pennsylvania legislature.\nBy 1824, with Crawford still in the race, Clay concluded that no candidate would win a majority of electoral votes; in that scenario, the House of Representatives would hold a contingent election to decide the election. Under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment, the top three electoral vote-getters would be eligible to be elected by the House. Clay was confident that he would prevail in a contingent held in the chamber he presided over, so long as he was eligible for election. Clay won Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri, but his loss in New York and Louisiana relegated him to a fourth-place finish behind Adams, Jackson, and Crawford. Clay was humiliated that he finished behind the invalid Crawford and Jackson, but supporters of the three remaining presidential candidates immediately began courting his support for the contingent election.\nFor various reasons, supporters of all three candidates believed they had the best chance of winning Clay's backing, but Clay quickly settled on supporting Adams. Of the three candidates, Adams was the most sympathetic to Clay's American System, and Clay viewed both Jackson and the sickly Crawford as unsuitable for the presidency. On January 9, 1825, Clay privately met with Adams for three hours, after which Clay promised Adams his support; both would later claim that they did not discuss Clay's position in an Adams administration. With the help of Clay, Adams won the House vote on the first ballot. After his election, Adams offered Clay the position of secretary of state, which Clay accepted, despite fears that he would be accused of trading his support for the Cabinet post. Jackson was outraged by the election, and he and his supporters accused Clay and Adams of having reached a \"Corrupt Bargain.\" Pro-Jackson forces immediately began preparing for the 1828 presidential election, with the Corrupt Bargain accusation becoming their central issue.\nSecretary of State.\nClay served as secretary of state from 1825 to 1829. As secretary of state, he was the top foreign policy official in the Adams administration, but he also held several domestic duties, such as oversight of the patent office. Clay came to like Adams, a former rival, and to despise Jackson. They developed a strong working relationship. Adams and Clay were both wary of forming entangling alliances with the emerging states, and they continued to uphold the Monroe Doctrine, which called for European non-intervention in former colonies. Clay was rebuffed in his efforts to reach a commercial treaty and a settlement of the Canada\u2013United States border with Britain, and was also unsuccessful in his attempts to make the French pay for damages arising from attacks on American shipping during the Napoleonic Wars. He had more success in negotiating commercial treaties with Latin American republics, reaching \"most favoured nation\" trade agreements in an attempt to ensure that no European country had a trading advantage over the United States. Seeking deeper relations with Latin American countries, Clay strongly favored sending American delegates to the Congress of Panama, but his efforts were defeated by opponents in the Senate.\nAdams proposed an ambitious domestic program based in large part on Clay's American System, but Clay warned the president that many of his proposals held little chance of passage in the 19th Congress. Adams's opponents defeated many of his proposals, including the establishment of a naval academy and a national observatory, but Adams did preside over the construction or initiation of major infrastructure projects like the National Road and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Followers of Adams began to call themselves National Republicans, and Jackson's followers became known as Democrats. Both campaigns spread untrue stories about the opposing candidates. Adams' followers denounced Jackson as a demagogue, and some Adams-aligned papers accused Jackson's wife Rachel of bigamy. Though Clay was not directly involved in these attacks, his failure to denounce them earned him the lifelong enmity of Jackson.\nClay was one of Adams's most important political advisers, but because of his myriad responsibilities as secretary of state, he was often unable to take part in campaigning. As Adams was averse to the use of patronage for political purposes, Jackson's campaign enjoyed a marked advantage in organization, and Adams' allies such as Clay and Daniel Webster were unable to create an equally powerful organization headed by the president. In the 1828 election, Jackson took 56% of the popular vote and won almost every state outside of New England; Clay was especially distressed by Jackson's victory in Kentucky. The election result represented not only the victory of a man Clay viewed as unqualified and unprincipled but also a rejection of Clay's domestic policies.\nLater career.\nJackson administration, 1829\u20131837.\nReturn to the Senate.\nEven with Clay out of office, President Jackson continued to see Clay as one of his major rivals, and Jackson at one point suspected Clay of being behind the Petticoat affair, a controversy involving the wives of his Cabinet members. Clay strongly opposed the 1830 Indian Removal Act, which authorized the administration to relocate Native Americans to land west of the Mississippi River. Another key point of contention between Clay and Jackson was the proposed Maysville Road, which would connect Maysville, Kentucky, to the National Road in Zanesville, Ohio; transportation advocates hoped that later extensions would eventually connect the National Road to New Orleans. In 1830, Jackson vetoed the project both because he felt that the road did not constitute interstate commerce, and also because he generally opposed using the federal government to promote economic modernization. While Jackson's veto garnered support from opponents of infrastructure spending, it damaged his base of support in Clay's home state of Kentucky. Clay returned to federal office in 1831 by winning election to the Senate over Richard Mentor Johnson in a 73 to 64 vote of the Kentucky legislature. His return to the Senate after 20 years, 8 months, 7 days out of office, marks the fourth-longest gap in service to the chamber in history.\nBank War and the 1832 presidential election.\nWith the defeat of Adams, Clay became the de facto leader of the National Republicans, and he began making preparations for a presidential campaign in the 1832 election. In 1831, Jackson made it clear that he was going to run for re-election, ensuring that support or opposition to his presidency would be a central feature of the upcoming race. Jackson's Democrats rallied around his policies towards the national bank, internal improvements, Indian removal, and nullification, but these policies also earned Jackson various enemies, including Vice President John C. Calhoun. However, Clay rejected overtures from the fledgling Anti-Masonic Party, and his attempt to convince Calhoun to serve as his running mate failed, leaving the opposition to Jackson split among different factions. Inspired by the Anti-Masonic Party's national convention, Clay's National Republican followers arranged for a national convention that nominated Clay for president.\nAs the 1832 election approached, the debate over the re-authorization of the national bank emerged as the most important issue in the campaign. By the early 1830s, the national bank had become the largest corporation in the United States, and banknotes issued by the national bank served as the de facto legal tender of the United States. Jackson disliked the national bank because of a hatred of both banks and paper currency. The bank's charter did not expire until 1836, but bank president Nicholas Biddle asked for renewal in 1831, hoping that election year pressure and support from Secretary of the Treasury Louis McLane would convince Jackson to allow the re-charter. Biddle's application set off the \"Bank War\"; Congress passed a bill to renew the national bank's charter, but Jackson vetoed it, holding the bank to be unconstitutional. Clay had initially hoped that the national bank re-charter would work to his advantage, but Jackson's allies seized on the issue, redefining the 1832 election as a choice between the president and a \"monied oligarchy.\" Ultimately, Clay was unable to defeat a popular sitting president. Jackson won 219 of the 286 electoral votes and 54.2% of the popular vote, carrying almost every state outside of New England.\nNullification Crisis.\nThe high rates of the Tariff of 1828 and the Tariff of 1832 angered many Southerners because they resulted in higher prices for imported goods. After the 1832 election, South Carolina held a state convention that declared the tariff rates of 1828 and 1832 to be nullified within the state, and further declared that federal collection of import duties would be illegal after January 1833. In response to this Nullification Crisis, Jackson issued his Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, which strongly denied the right of states to nullify federal laws or secede. He asked Congress to pass what became known as the Force Bill, which would authorize the president to send federal soldiers against South Carolina if it sought to nullify federal law.\nThough Clay favored high tariff rates, he found Jackson's strong rhetoric against South Carolina distressing and sought to avoid a crisis that could end in civil war. He proposed a compromise tariff bill that would lower tariff rates, but do so gradually, thereby giving manufacturing interests time to adapt to less protective rates. Clay's compromise tariff won the backing of both manufacturers, who believed they would not receive a better deal, and Calhoun, who sought a way out of the crisis but refused to work with President Jackson's supporters on an alternative tariff bill. Though most members of Clay's own National Republican Party opposed it, the Tariff of 1833 passed both houses of Congress. Jackson simultaneously signed the tariff bill and the Force bill, and South Carolina leaders accepted the new tariff, effectively bringing the crisis to an end. Clay's role in resolving the crisis brought him renewed national stature in the wake of a crushing presidential election defeat, and some began referring to him as the \"Great Compromiser.\"\nFormation of the Whig Party.\nFollowing the end of the Nullification Crisis in March 1833, Jackson renewed his offensive against the national bank, despite some opposition from within his own Cabinet. Jackson and Secretary of the Treasury Roger Taney pursued a policy of removing all federal deposits from the national bank and placing them in state-chartered banks known as \"pet banks.\" Because federal law required the president to deposit federal revenue in the national bank so long as it was financially stable, many regarded Jackson's actions as illegal, and Clay led the passage of a Senate motion censuring Jackson. Nonetheless, the national bank's federal charter expired in 1836, and though the institution continued to function under a Pennsylvania charter, it never regained the influence it had had at the beginning of Jackson's administration.\nThe removal of deposits helped unite Jackson's opponents into one party for the first time, as National Republicans, Calhounites, former Democrats, and members of the Anti-Masonic Party coalesced into the Whig Party. The term \"Whig\" originated from a speech Clay delivered in 1834, in which he compared opponents of Jackson to the Whigs, a British political party opposed to absolute monarchy. Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified geographically or ideologically. However, Whigs tended to favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, greater spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, hard money, and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery. The Whig base of support lay in wealthy businessmen, professionals, the professional class, and large planters, while the Democratic base of support lay in immigrant Catholics and yeomen farmers, but each party appealed across class lines.\nPartly due to grief over the death of his daughter, Anne, Clay chose not to run in the 1836 presidential election, and the Whigs were too disorganized to nominate a single candidate. Three Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General William Henry Harrison, Senator Hugh Lawson White, and Senator Daniel Webster. By running multiple candidates, the Whigs hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Clay personally preferred Webster, but he threw his backing behind Harrison who had the broadest appeal among voters. Clay's decision not to endorse Webster opened a rift between the two Whig party leaders, and Webster would work against Clay in future presidential elections. Despite the presence of multiple Whig candidates, Van Buren won the 1836 election with 50.8 percent of the popular vote and 170 of the 294 electoral votes.\nVan Buren administration, 1837\u20131841.\nVan Buren's presidency was affected badly by the Panic of 1837, a major recession that badly damaged the Democratic Party. Clay and other Whigs argued that Jackson's policies, including the use of pet banks, had encouraged speculation and caused the panic. He promoted the American System as a means for economic recovery, but President Van Buren's response focused on the practice of \"strict economy and frugality.\" As the 1840 presidential election approached, many expected that the Whigs would win control of the presidency due to the ongoing economic crisis. Clay initially viewed Webster as his strongest rival, but Clay, Harrison, and General Winfield Scott emerged as the principal candidates at the 1839 Whig National Convention.\nThough he was widely regarded as the most qualified Whig leader to serve as president, many Whigs questioned Clay's electability after two presidential election defeats. He also faced opposition in the North due to his ownership of enslaved people and lingering association with the Freemasons, and in the South from Whigs who distrusted his moderate stance on slavery. Clay won a plurality on the first ballot of the Whig National Convention, but, with the help of Thurlow Weed and other backers, Harrison consolidated support on subsequent ballots and won the Whig presidential nomination on the fifth ballot of the convention. Seeking to placate Clay's supporters and to balance the ticket geographically, the convention chose former Virginia Governor and Senator John Tyler, a personal friend of Clay, whose previous career in the Democratic Party had practically come to an end, as the vice-presidential nominee. Clay was disappointed by the outcome but helped Harrison's ultimately successful campaign by delivering numerous speeches. With Whigs also winning control of Congress in the 1840 elections, Clay saw the upcoming 27th Congress as an opportunity for the Whig Party to establish itself as the dominant political party by leading the country out of recession.\nHarrison and Tyler administrations, 1841\u20131845.\nPresident-elect Harrison asked Clay to serve another term as Secretary of State, but Clay chose to remain in Congress. Webster was instead chosen as Secretary of State, while John J. Crittenden, a close ally of Clay, was chosen as Attorney General. As Harrison prepared to take office, Clay and Harrison clashed over the leadership of the Whig Party, with Harrison sensitive to accusations that he would answer to Clay. Just a month into his presidency, Harrison died of an illness and was succeeded by Vice President John Tyler. Tyler retained Harrison's Cabinet, but the former Democrat and avid follower of both Jefferson's and Jackson's philosophy quickly made it known that he had reservations about re-establishing a national bank, a key priority of Clay's. Clay nonetheless initially expected that Tyler would approve the measures passed by the Whig-controlled Congress; his priorities included the re-establishment of the national bank, higher tariff rates, a national bankruptcy law, and an act to distribute the proceeds of land sales to the states for investments in infrastructure and education. Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank, showing that he in fact had no will to reach a solution for the party's issues. Clay and other Whig leaders were now outraged not only by Tyler's rejection of the Whig party platform but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.\nAfter the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and on Clay's request, every Cabinet member except for Webster, who wanted to continue negotiating the Webster-Ashburton Treaty with Great Britain about the border to Canada, resigned from office. This made Tyler increasingly move closer to his former Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party. In early 1842, Clay resigned from the Senate after arranging for Crittenden to succeed him. Though he vetoed other Whig bills, Tyler did sign some Whig priorities into law, including the Preemption Act of 1841, which distributed the proceeds of land sales to the states, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy. Facing a large budget deficit, Tyler also signed the Tariff of 1842, which restored the protective rates of the Tariff of 1832 but ended the distribution policy that had been established with the Preemption Act of 1841.\n1844 presidential election.\nPresident Tyler's break with the Whig Party, combined with Webster's continuing affiliation with Tyler, positioned Clay as the leading contender for the Whig nomination in the 1844 presidential election. By 1842, most observers believed that Clay would face Van Buren in the 1844 presidential election, as he had still remained as the clear leader of the Democrats and, following the tradition of the founders, wanted a second term. Hoping to win another term, President Tyler forged an alliance with John C. Calhoun and pursued the annexation of the Republic of Texas, which would add another slave state to the union. After President Tyler concluded an annexation treaty with Texas, Clay announced his opposition to annexation. He argued that the country needed \"union, peace, and patience,\" and annexation would bring tensions over slavery and war with Mexico. The same day that Clay published a letter opposing the annexation of Texas, Van Buren also came out against annexation, citing similar reasons as Clay, so that slavery and especially expansionism seemed to play no role in the next election. Clay unanimously won the presidential nomination at the 1844 Whig National Convention, but a minority of expansionist Southern Democrats, encouraged by Tyler's alternative outline, blocked Van Buren's nomination at the 1844 Democratic National Convention for countless ballots, until Van Buren withdrew, making place for an unexpected compromise candidate: The party nominated former Speaker of the House James K. Polk of Tennessee, who favored annexation, but in order to calm anti-expansionists, promised to just run for a single term. Following the nomination of a pro-annexation Democrat, Tyler soon ended his incipient independent run for president and endorsed Polk.\nClay was surprised by Van Buren's defeat but remained confident of his chances in the 1844 election. Polk was the first \"dark horse\" presidential nominee in U.S. history, and Whigs mocked him as a \"fourth rate politician.\" Despite his relative lack of national stature, Polk proved to be a strong candidate capable of uniting the factions of the Democratic Party and winning the support of Southerners who had been reluctant to support Van Buren. Clay's stance on slavery alienated some voters in both the North and the South. Pro-slavery Southerners flocked to Polk, while many Northern abolitionists, who tended to align with the Whig Party, favored James G. Birney of the Liberty Party. Clay's opposition to annexation damaged his campaign in the South, as Democrats argued that he worked in unison with Northerners to stop the extension of slavery. In July, Clay wrote two letters in which he attempted to clarify his position on the annexation of Texas, and Democrats attacked his supposedly inconsistent position.\nPolk narrowly won the election, taking 49.5% of the popular vote and 170 of the 275 electoral votes. Birney won several thousand anti-annexation votes in New York, and his presence in the race may have cost Clay the election. Most of Clay's contemporaries believed that annexation had been the decisive issue in the race, but Polk's savvy campaigning on the tariff may have also been decisive, as he narrowly won pro-tariff Pennsylvania after downplaying his anti-tariff views. After Polk's victory and the final indirect success of Tyler's strategy, Congress approved the annexation of Texas, which was signed by Tyler on his last day in office, and Texas gained statehood in late 1845.\nPolk administration, 1845\u20131849.\nAfter the 1844 election, Clay returned to his career as an attorney. Though he was no longer a member of Congress, he remained closely interested in national politics. In 1846, the Mexican\u2013American War broke out after American and Mexican forces clashed at the disputed border region between Mexico and Texas. Initially, Clay did not publicly oppose the war, but privately he saw it as an immoral war that risked producing \"some military chieftain who will conquer us all.\" He suffered a personal blow in 1847 when his son, Henry Clay Jr., died at the Battle of Buena Vista. In November 1847, Clay re-emerged on the political scene with a speech that was harshly critical of the Mexican\u2013American War and President Polk. He attacked Polk for fomenting the conflict with Mexico and urged the rejection of any treaty that added new slave territory to the United States. Months after the speech, the Senate ratified the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in which Mexico ceded hundreds of thousands of square miles of territory known as the Mexican Cession.\nBy 1847, General Zachary Taylor, who commanded the American forces at Buena Vista, had emerged as a contender for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election. Despite Taylor's largely unknown political views, many Whigs believed he was the party's strongest possible candidate due to his martial accomplishments in the Mexican\u2013American War. One of Clay's most trusted allies and advisers, John J. Crittenden, was Taylor's de facto campaign manager. Clay had initially told his allies that he would not run in the 1848 presidential election, but he was unwilling to support Taylor, a \"mere military man.\" On April 10, 1848, he announced his candidacy for the Whig nomination. Although Webster and Winfield Scott each commanded a limited base of support in the party, Taylor and Clay each saw the other as their lone serious rival for the Whig nomination. As Taylor commanded the support of most Southern Whigs, Clay focused his efforts on courting Northern Whigs, emphasizing his opposition to the Mexican\u2013American War and his life-long support for the gradual emancipation of enslaved people in Kentucky. Clay presented a strong challenge to Taylor at the 1848 Whig National Convention, but Taylor won the presidential nomination on the fourth ballot. Partially in an attempt to please the Clay wing of the party, the convention nominated Millard Fillmore as Taylor's running mate. Clay was embittered by his failure at the convention, and he did not campaign on behalf of Taylor. Nonetheless, Taylor won the election, taking 47.3 percent of the popular vote and 163 of 290 electoral votes.\nTaylor and Fillmore administrations, 1849\u20131852.\nIncreasingly worried about the sectional tensions arising over the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories, Clay accepted election to the Senate in 1849. Having refused to campaign for Taylor, Clay played little role in the formation of Taylor's Cabinet or in determining the new administration's policies. In January 1850, with Congress still deadlocked regarding the status of the Mexican Cession, Clay proposed a compromise designed to organize territory acquired in the Mexican\u2013American War and address other issues contributing to sectional tensions. His legislative package included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of enslaved people into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. Though it faced opposition from Southern extremists like Calhoun and Northern abolitionists like William Seward, Clay's proposal won the backing of many Southern and Northern leaders.\nPresident Taylor, who favored the immediate admission of California and New Mexico as free states without any attached conditions, opposed the plan, and Clay openly broke with the president in May 1850. Debate over Clay's proposal continued into July when Taylor unexpectedly died of an illness. After Taylor's death, President Fillmore, who supported Clay's compromise bill, consulted with Clay in appointing a new Cabinet. Exhausted by the debate in the Senate, Clay took a leave of absence shortly after Taylor's death, but Fillmore, Webster, and Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas took charge of pro-compromise forces. By the end of September 1850, Clay's proposal, which became known as the Compromise of 1850, had been enacted. Though contemporaries credited Fillmore, Douglas, and Webster for their role in passing the Compromise of 1850, Clay was widely regarded as the key figure in ending a major sectional crisis.\nDeath.\nIn December 1851, at the age of 74, with his health declining, Clay announced that he would resign from the Senate the following September. Clay never recovered from his illnesses. He eventually died of tuberculosis aged 75 in his room at the National Hotel in Washington, D.C., on June 29, 1852. He was the first person to lie in state in the United States Capitol rotunda.\nClay's headstone reads: \"I know no North\u2014no South\u2014no East\u2014no West\". Hymn writer Fanny Crosby penned this line of lament on Clay's death:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIdeology and slavery.\nAmerican System.\nThroughout most of his political life, Clay promoted his American System as both an economic program and a means for unifying the country. Clay's American System rejected strict constructionism in favor of an activist government that would promote industry and commerce. The American System had four key tenets: high tariffs, a stable financial system, federal investment in internal improvements, and a public land sale policy designed to raise revenue and provide for carefully managed expansion into the American frontier. Through high tariffs, Clay hoped to free the United States from dependence on foreign imports, especially from Britain. Clay sought to ensure a stable financial system through support for the national bank, which regulated the country's banking system and helped ensure a consistent supply of credit. Clay's support for federally financed internal improvements stemmed from his belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally. His land policy focused on using federal revenue from land sales to fund states' investments in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.\nPractices as an enslaver and the Dupuy case.\nClay inherited enslaved people as a young child, and he continued to own enslaved people throughout his life. In the 1790s, he adopted anti-slavery views under the influence of his mentor, Founding Father George Wythe, who emancipated his own human property. Like most of his contemporaries, Clay was not a racial egalitarian and never called for the immediate abolition of slavery, but he viewed slavery as a \"grievous wrong to the slave\" and spoke in favor of equal treatment for free blacks. Early in his career, Clay favored gradual emancipation in both Kentucky and Missouri, but each state rejected plans that would have provided for gradual emancipation. Clay continued to support gradual emancipation throughout his career and published an open letter in 1849 calling for gradual emancipation in Kentucky, though he qualified this view by stating he would only support emancipation if it included a plan for colonizing free blacks outside of the state. Unlike many other Southern leaders, he consistently favored recognition of Haiti, which had been established through a slave revolt.\nIn 1816, Clay helped establish the American Colonization Society, a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa. The group was made up of abolitionists who wanted to end slavery and slaveholders who wanted to deport free blacks. Clay's support for colonization reflected his belief that a multiracial society was ultimately unworkable, both for whites and free blacks. Under Clay's plan, all enslaved children born after 1860 would be freed at age 25. At that time, they were to work for three years in order to finance their own importation. During this period, enslavers could still sell or mortgage their human property. Some abolitionists did not view this plan favorably. In 1849, Frederick Douglass denounced this plan in a speech to the New England Anti-Slavery Society at Faneuil Hall. He objected to the three years when the enslaved were in jeopardy as they were still held as property. The date of 1860 would lead to family separations as those born before 1860 would remain enslaved and those born after were subjected to a mandatory importation. Those gathered first applauded at the mention of Clay; however, once Douglass made these points, those gathered change their response to hisses and cries of shame. Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that \"the ultraism of the South on the one hand ... and the ultraism of abolition on the other\" represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the gag rule, which limited congressional debate on slavery.\nOn his 600-acre plantation, there were 122 enslaved people held over the course of his life. Clay's status as a slave owner and his anti-slavery views occasionally led to conflicts in his political career. During a visit to Indiana in the 1840s, Clay was confronted at a political meeting by a Quaker abolitionist, Hiram Mendenhall, who presented Clay with a petition calling on him to free his enslaved people. Clay dismissed Mendenhall out of hand, stating that the petition was no different from if it demanded he give up his farm. Many of his contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist James G. Birney, believed that Clay's home state of Kentucky had the laws most permissive to enslaved people of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a \"good\" master. Biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery; however, showing the opposite is his treatment of the family of Lewis Hayden. Klotter also states that there is no evidence that Clay ever had sex with any of his enslaved people. Others state quite the contrary of his punitive and sexual practices.\nIn 1844, Clay's wife discovered that he was having relations with the \"yellow girl that attended his poultry and fowls\". The young woman and her children were then sent to Louisiana to be sold. While in Washington, D.C., Clay acquired an octoroon to serve as concubine. Phoebe Moore, age 16, was purchased by Henry Clay from his wife's cousin, Senator Thomas Hart Benton, according to her obituary in New Orleans \"Times-Picayune\"\".\" When he was in Washington, she resided with Clay in his Washington home and bore him two children. After he emancipated her, she moved to Memphis, Tennessee.\nRegarding keeping families together, Clay applied the opposite to the family of Lewis Hayden. Around 1836. Clay had an enslaved mother, Esther Harvey, and her son sold South. They were the family of Lewis Hayden, a waiter at the upscale Phoenix Hotel. Around 1842, Hayden was threatened, also by Clay, with the sale of his second wife, Harriet Bell Hayden and her son Joseph who he had adopted. Hayden secured the aid of Vermont resident Delia Webster and Oberlin College student Rev. Calvin Fairbank through the assistance of John Mifflin, AME minister and resident of Oberlin, Ohio. They crafted a successful escape plan via the Underground Railroad through Maysville, Kentucky, across the Ohio River to the free states of Ohio and Michigan. The Haydens became residents of Amherstburg, Ontario, Canada. On January 4, 1845, Webster received a sentence of two years hard labor for her part in the escape; she was pardoned on February 24, 1845. Also during February, Fairbank was sentenced to 15 years. The Kentucky governor pardoned him in 1849. However, he was imprisoned again in 1852 and served 12 years for aiding in another escape.\nAnother example is Lewis Richardson, Clay's self-emancipated enslaved person. He gave a speech that belies Clay's self-portrayal as a \"good master\". Richardson had been enslaved at Ashland for 20 years, and after a beating escaped via the Underground Railroad in January, 1846. By May of that year, Richardson was also living in Amherstburg, Ontario. In a speech he gave at Union Chapel there, he told not only of continual sparse food and lack of warm clothing but of 150 lashes from overseer Ambrose Brice for the offense of being an hour late returning from a visit to his wife. Brice later denied this claim, stating it was 16 lashes, and the offense was drunkenness. Clay was away on business when this occurred. Richardson's speech was published in the abolitionist newspaper \"Signal of Liberty\". The text of his speech is available at the following reference.\nIn 1829, Charlotte Dupuy, who was enslaved by Clay, sued for her freedom while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay's successor as secretary of state. The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court. After winning the case, Clay sent Dupuy to New Orleans, causing her to be away from her own family, but he later freed Dupuy and two of her children. Aaron Dupuy, Charlotte's husband, was ordered by Clay to be whipped, at the behest of Clay's wife, Lucretia. Dupuy's infraction was a late return as Lucretia's carriage driver. The overseer attempted the whipping, but Dupuy managed to wrest the whip away and began beating the overseer. He was not freed at the time of Clay's death, but became freed after the Civil War. Clay himself wrote, \"here in Kentucky slavery is in its most mitigated form, still it is slavery.\" Clay's will provided for the gradual emancipation of the slaves he held at the time of his death in 1852. Aaron Dupuy was an exception. Clay also stipulated that several of those enslaved people were bequeathed to his son, John.\nLegacy.\nHistorical reputation.\nClay's Whig Party collapsed four years after his death, but Clay cast a long shadow over the generation of political leaders that presided over the Civil War. Mississippi Senator Henry S. Foote stated his opinion that \"had there been one such man in the Congress of the United States as Henry Clay in 1860\u20131861 there would, I feel sure, have been no civil war\". Clay's protege and fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden attempted to keep the Union together with the formation of the Constitutional Union Party and the proposed Crittenden Compromise. Though Crittenden's efforts were unsuccessful, Kentucky remained in the Union during the Civil War, reflecting in part Clay's continuing influence. Abraham Lincoln was a great admirer of Clay, saying he was \"my ideal of a great man\". Lincoln wholeheartedly supported Clay's economic programs; prior to the Civil War, he also held similar stances about slavery and the Union. Some historians have argued that a Clay victory in the 1844 election would have prevented both the Mexican-American War and the American Civil War.\nClay is generally regarded as one of the important political figures of his era. Most historians and political scientists consider Clay to be one of the most influential speakers of the house in U.S. history. In 1957, a Senate Committee selected Clay as one of the five greatest U.S. senators, along with Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Robert La Follette, and Robert A. Taft. A 1986 survey of historians ranked Clay as the greatest senator in U.S. history, while a 2006 survey of historians ranked Clay as the 31st-most influential American of all time. A 1998 poll of historians ranked Clay as the most qualified unsuccessful major party presidential nominee in U.S. history. In 2015, political scientist Michael G. Miller and historian Ken Owen ranked Clay as one of the four most influential American politicians who never served as president, alongside Alexander Hamilton, William Jennings Bryan, and Calhoun. Noting Clay's influence over the United States in the last three decades of his life, biographer James Klotter writes that \"perhaps posterity should no longer call it the Jacksonian Era ... and instead term it the Clay Era.\"\nMonuments and memorials.\nMany monuments, memorials, and even high schools have been erected and named in honor of Clay. Sixteen counties, one each in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia, are named for Clay. Communities named for Clay include Clay, Kentucky, Clay, West Virginia, Claysville, Alabama and Claysville, Pennsylvania. The United States Navy named a submarine, the , in his honor. Several statues honor Clay, including the Henry Clay Monument in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and one of Kentucky's two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Clay's estate of Ashland is a National Historic Landmark. The Decatur House, Clay's home in Washington, D.C. during his tenure as secretary of state, is also a National Historic Landmark. Due to his involvement in the American Colonization Society, a town in the newly formed Liberia in West Africa was named Clay-Ashland after Henry Clay and to where the freed enslaved people from Kentucky emigrated. Clay is also one of the \"famous five\" senators honored with their portraits in the Senate Reception Room.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"He loved his country partly because it was his own country, but mostly because it was a free country.\" \u2014 Lincoln's Eulogy for Henry Clay \u2013 July 6, 1852\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\"\nstyle=\"width:100%\""}
{"id": "47621", "revid": "2842084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47621", "title": "Isabella of France", "text": "Queen of England from 1308 to 1327\nIsabella of France (c.\u20091295 \u2013 22 August 1358), sometimes described as the She-Wolf of France (), was Queen of England as the wife of King Edward II, and \"de facto\" regent of England from 1327 until 1330. She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of King Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She overthrew her husband, becoming a \"femme fatale\" figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and manipulative figure.\nIsabella arrived in England at age 12 during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite, Piers Gaveston, but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After the death of Gaveston at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward turned to a new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the Despenser War and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser, and by 1325, her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point.\nTravelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with Roger Mortimer, and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming regent on behalf of her young son, Edward III. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the murder of Edward II. Isabella and Mortimer's regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the war with Scotland.\nIn 1330, aged 18, Isabella's son, Edward III forcibly asserted his authority. Mortimer was executed, Isabella's regency was ended and she was imprisoned, but soon released. She lived out her remaining years as a wealthy courtier and grew close again to her family, especially her daughter Joan, Queen of Scots, and her grandson Edward, Prince of Wales.\nEarly life and marriage: 1295\u20131308.\nIsabella was born in Paris on an uncertain date \u2013 on the basis of the chroniclers and the eventual date of her marriage, she was probably born between April 1295 and January 1296. She is described as born in 1292 in the Annals of Wigmore, and Piers Langtoft agrees, claiming that she was 7 years old in 1299. The French chronicler Guillaume de Nangis and English chronicler Thomas Walsingham describe her as 12 years old at the time of her marriage in January 1308, placing her birth between January 1295 and January 1296. A papal dispensation by Clement V in November 1305 permitted her immediate marriage by proxy, despite the fact that she was probably only 10 years old. Since her brother Charles was born on 18 June 1294, and she had to reach the canonical age of 12 before her marriage in January 1308, the evidence suggests that she was born between April 1295 and January 1296. Her parents were King Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre; her brothers Louis, Philip and Charles became kings of France.\nIsabella was born into a royal family that ruled the most powerful state in Western Europe. Her father, King Philip, known as \"le Bel\" (the Fair) because of his good looks, was a strangely unemotional man; one contemporary described him as \"neither a man nor a beast, but a statue\"; modern historians have noted that he \"cultivated a reputation for Christian kingship and showed few weaknesses of the flesh\". Philip built up centralised royal power in France, engaging in a sequence of conflicts to expand or consolidate French authority across the region, but remained chronically short of money throughout his reign. Indeed, he appeared almost obsessed about building up wealth and lands, something that his daughter was also accused of in later life. Isabella's mother died when Isabella was still quite young; some contemporaries suspected Philip IV of her murder, albeit probably incorrectly.\nIsabella was brought up in and around the Louvre Palace and the Palais de la Cit\u00e9 in Paris. Isabella was cared for by Th\u00e9ophania de Saint-Pierre, her nurse, given a good education and taught to read, developing a love of books. As was customary for the period, all of Philip's children were married young for political benefit. Isabella was promised in marriage by her father to Edward II, the son of King Edward I of England, with the intention to resolve the conflicts between France and England over the latter's continental possession of Gascony and claims to Anjou, Normandy and Aquitaine. Pope Boniface VIII had urged the marriage as early as 1298 but it was delayed by wrangling over the terms of the marriage contract. The renewal of the Anglo-French truce in 1299 led to the marriage of Edward I to Philip's sister Margaret, further anticipating the marriage of Isabella to Edward II. In 1303, Edward I may have considered a Castilian bride for Edward II instead of Isabella and even increased her dowry before the wedding. Edward I attempted to break the engagement several times for political advantage, and only after he died in 1307 did the wedding proceed.\nIsabella and Edward II were finally married at Boulogne-sur-Mer on 25 January 1308. Isabella's wardrobe gives some indications of her wealth and style \u2013 she had dresses of baudekyn, velvet, taffeta and cloth, along with numerous furs; she had over 72 headdresses and coifs; she brought with her two gold crowns, gold and silver dinnerware and 419 yards of linen. At the time of her marriage, Isabella was probably about twelve and was described by Geoffrey of Paris as \"the beauty of beauties... in the kingdom if not in all Europe.\" This description was probably not simply flattery by a chronicler, since both Isabella's father and brothers were considered very handsome men by contemporaries, and her husband was to nickname her \"Isabella the Fair\". Isabella was said to resemble her father, and not her mother, queen regnant of Navarre, a plump, plain woman. This indicates that Isabella was slender and pale-skinned, although the fashion at the time was for blonde, slightly full-faced women, and Isabella may well have followed this stereotype instead. Throughout her career, Isabella was noted as charming and diplomatic, with a particular skill at convincing people to follow her courses of action. Unusual for the medieval period, contemporaries also commented on her high intelligence.\nQueenship.\nAs queen, the young Isabella faced numerous challenges. Edward was handsome, but also possibly formed close romantic attachments first to Piers Gaveston and then to Hugh Despenser the Younger. Edward found himself at odds with the barons, too, in particular his first cousin Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, whilst continuing the war against the Scots that he had inherited from Edward I. Using her own supporters at court and the patronage of her French family, Isabella attempted to find a political path through these challenges. She successfully formed an alliance with Gaveston, but after his death at the hands of the barons, her position grew increasingly precarious. Edward began to take revenge on his enemies, using an ever more brutal alliance with the Despenser family, in particular his new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger. By 1326, Isabella found herself increasingly at odds with both Edward and Hugh, ultimately resulting in Isabella's own bid for power and an invasion of England.\nFall of Gaveston: 1308\u20131312.\nEdward was an unusual character by medieval standards. Edward looked the part of a Plantagenet king: he was tall, athletic, and wildly popular at the beginning of his reign. However, he rejected most of the traditional pursuits of a king for the period \u2013 jousting, hunting and warfare \u2013 and instead enjoyed music, poetry and rural crafts. Furthermore, there is the question of Edward's sexuality in a period when homosexuality was considered a serious crime, but there is no direct evidence of his sexual orientation. Contemporary chroniclers made much of his close affinity with a succession of male favourites. Some condemned Edward for loving them \"beyond measure\" and \"uniquely\", others explicitly referring to an \"illicit and sinful union\". Nonetheless, Isabella bore four children by Edward, leading some historians to believe that Edward's affairs with his male favourites were platonic, despite Isabella's complaints of whose bed he visited.\nWhen Isabella first arrived in England following her marriage, her husband was already involved with Piers Gaveston, an \"arrogant, ostentatious\" soldier, with a \"reckless and headstrong\" personality that appealed to Edward. Isabella, then aged twelve, was effectively sidelined by the pair. Edward chose to sit with Gaveston rather than Isabella at their wedding celebration, causing grave offence to her uncles Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux, and Charles, Count of Valois, and then refused to grant her either her own lands or her own household. Edward also gave Gaveston Isabella's own jewelry, which he wore publicly. Isabella complained to her father that Gaveston took her place next to Edward II, she received insufficient funds and Edward visited Gaveston's bed more than hers. It took the intervention of Isabella's father, Philip IV before Edward began to provide for her more appropriately.\nIsabella's relationship with Gaveston was complex. For a time, her dislike of him was widely known, and she was said to be in contact with her father, the pope and cardinals in order to have him exiled. Baronial opposition to Gaveston, championed by Thomas of Lancaster, increased; and Philip IV began to covertly fund this grouping, using Isabella and her household as intermediaries. Edward was forced to exile Gaveston to Ireland for a period and began to show Isabella much greater respect, assigning her lands and patronage. In turn, Philip ceased his support for the barons. Gaveston eventually returned from Ireland, and by 1309\u201311, the three seemed to be co-existing together relatively comfortably. Indeed, Gaveston's key enemy, Edward and Isabella's uncle Thomas of Lancaster, considered her to be an ally of Gaveston. Isabella had begun to build up her own supporters at court, principally the Beaumont family, itself opposed to the Lancastrians. Similarly originating from France, the senior member of the Beaumont family, Isabella de Beaumont, had been a close confidant of Edward's mother Eleanor of Castile, supported by her brother Henry de Beaumont.\nIn 1311, Edward conducted a failed campaign against the Scots, during which he and Isabella barely escaped capture. In the aftermath, the barons rose up, signing the Ordinances of 1311, which promised action against Gaveston and expelled Isabella and Henry de Beaumont from court. England fully descended into civil war in 1312. Isabella stood with Edward, sending angry letters to her uncles Louis and Charles asking for support. Edward left Isabella against her will at Tynemouth Priory in Northumberland whilst he unsuccessfully attempted to fight the barons. The campaign was a disaster, and although Edward escaped, Gaveston found himself stranded at Scarborough Castle where his baronial enemies then surrounded and captured him. Guy de Beauchamp and Thomas of Lancaster ensured Gaveston's execution as he was being taken south to rejoin Edward.\nTensions grow: 1312\u20131321.\nTensions mounted steadily over the decade. In 1312, Isabella gave birth to the future Edward III, but by the end of the year Edward's court was beginning to change. Edward was still relying heavily upon his French in-laws, one of which was Isabella's uncle Louis who had been sent from Paris to assist him. However, Hugh Despenser the Elder now formed part of the inner circle, marking the beginning of the Despensers' increased prominence at Edward's court. The Despensers were opposed to both the Lancastrians and their other allies in the Welsh Marches, making an easy alliance with Edward, who sought revenge for the death of Gaveston.\nIn 1313, Isabella travelled to Paris with Edward to garner further French support, which resulted in the Tour de Nesle affair. The journey was a pleasant one, with many festivities, although Isabella was injured when her tent burned down. During the visit, her brothers Louis and Charles put on a satirical puppet show for their guests and Isabella gave new embroidered purses both to her brothers and to their wives. Isabella and Edward then returned to England with new assurances of French support against the English barons. Later in the year, however, when Isabella and Edward held a large dinner in London to celebrate their return, Isabella apparently noticed that the purses she had given to her sisters-in-law were now being carried by two Norman knights: Gautier and Philippe d'Aunay. Isabella concluded that the pair must have been carrying on an illicit affair, and appears to have informed her father of this during her next visit to France in 1314. The consequence of this was the Tour de Nesle affair in Paris, which led to legal action against all three of Isabella's sisters-in-law. Blanche and Margaret of Burgundy were imprisoned for life while Joan of Burgundy was imprisoned for a year before being acquitted. Isabella's reputation in France suffered somewhat as a result of her perceived role in the affair.\nIn the north, however, the situation was becoming worse. Edward attempted to quash the Scots in a fresh campaign in 1314, resulting in the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn. Edward was blamed by the barons for the catastrophic failure of the campaign. Thomas of Lancaster reacted to the defeats in Scotland by taking increased power in England and turning against Isabella, cutting off funds and harassing her household. To make matters worse, the \"Great Famine\" descended on England during 1315\u201317, causing widespread loss of life and financial problems.\nDespite Isabella giving birth to her second son, John, in 1316, Edward's position was precarious. Indeed, John Deydras, a royal pretender, appeared in Oxford, claiming to have been switched with Edward at birth, and to be the real king of England himself. Given Edward's unpopularity, the rumours spread considerably before Deydras' eventual execution, and appear to have greatly upset Isabella. Isabella responded by deepening her alliance with Lancaster's enemy, Henry de Beaumont, and by taking up an increased role in government herself, including attending council meetings and acquiring increased lands. Henry's sister, Isabella de Vesci, continued to remain a close adviser to the Queen. The Scottish general Sir James Douglas, war leader for Robert I of Scotland, made a bid to capture Isabella personally in 1319. He almost succeeded in capturing her at York, with Isabella only just barely escaping. Suspicions fell on Lancaster, and one of Edward's knights, Edmund Darel, was arrested on charges of having betrayed her location, but the charges were essentially unproven. In 1320, Isabella accompanied Edward to France to try and convince her brother, Philip V, to provide fresh support to crush the English barons.\nMeanwhile, Hugh de Despenser the Younger became an increasing favourite of Isabella's husband, and was believed by some to have begun a sexual relationship with him around this time. Hugh was the same age as Edward. His father, Hugh the Elder, had supported Edward and Gaveston a few years previously. The Despensers were bitter enemies of Lancaster, and, with Edward's support, began to increase their power base in the Welsh Marches, in the process making enemies of Roger Mortimer de Chirk and his nephew, Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, their rival Marcher Lords. Whilst Isabella had been able to work with Gaveston, Edward's previous favourite, it became increasingly clear that Hugh the Younger and Isabella could not work out a similar compromise. Unfortunately for Isabella, she was still estranged from Lancaster's rival faction, giving her little room to manoeuvre. In 1321, Lancaster's alliance moved against the Despensers, sending troops into London and demanding their exile. Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, a moderate baron with strong French links, asked Isabella to intervene in an attempt to prevent war; Isabella publicly went down on her knees to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers, providing him with a face-saving excuse to do so, but Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity. Isabella's attempts, though heavily praised by the English, had very little impact and she had no lasting effect as a mediator for foreign or domestic affairs.\nReturn of the Despensers, 1321\u20131326.\nDespite the momentary respite delivered by Isabella, by the autumn of 1321, the tensions between the two factions of Edward, Isabella and the Despenser, opposing the baronial opposition led by Thomas of Lancaster, were extremely high, with forces still mobilised across the country. At this point, Isabella undertook a pilgrimage to Canterbury, during which she left the traditional route to stop at Leeds Castle in Kent, a fortification held by Bartholomew de Badlesmere, steward of the King's household who had by 1321 joined the ranks of Edward's opponents. Some historians believe that the pilgrimage was a deliberate act by Isabella on Edward's behalf to create a \"casus belli\". Lord Badlesmere was away at the time, having left his wife Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere in charge of the castle. When the latter adamantly refused the Queen's admittance, fighting broke out outside the castle between Isabella's guards and the garrison, marking the beginning of the Despenser War. Whilst Edward mobilised his own faction and placed Leeds Castle under siege, Isabella was given the Great Seal and assumed control of the royal Chancery from the Tower of London. After surrendering to Edward's forces on 31 October 1321, Margaret, Baroness Badlesmere, Kent and her children were sent to the Tower, and 13 of the Leeds garrison were hanged. By January 1322, Edward's army, reinforced by the Despensers returning from exile, had forced the surrender of the Mortimers, and by March Lancaster himself had been captured after the Battle of Boroughbridge; Lancaster was promptly executed, leaving Edward and the Despensers victorious.\nHugh Despenser the Younger was now firmly ensconced as Edward's new favourite and together over the next four years Edward and the Despensers imposed a harsh rule over England, a \"sweeping revenge\" characterised by land confiscation, large-scale imprisonment, executions and the punishment of extended family members, including women and the elderly. This was condemned by contemporary chroniclers, and is felt to have caused concern to Isabella as well; some of those widows being persecuted included her friends. Isabella's relationship with Despenser the Younger continued to deteriorate; the Despensers refused to pay her monies owed to her, or return her castles at Marlborough and Devizes. Indeed, various authors have suggested that there is evidence that Hugh Despenser the Younger attempted to assault Isabella herself in some fashion. Certainly, immediately after the Battle of Boroughbridge, Edward began to be markedly less generous in his gifts towards Isabella, and none of the spoils of the war were awarded to her. Worse still, later in the year Isabella was caught up in the failure of another of Edward's campaigns in Scotland, in a way that permanently poisoned her relationship with both Edward and the Despensers.\nIsabella and Edward had travelled north together at the start of the autumn campaign. Before the disastrous Battle of Old Byland in Yorkshire, Edward had ridden south, apparently to raise more men, sending Isabella east to Tynemouth Priory. With the Scottish army marching south, Isabella expressed considerable concern about her personal safety and requested assistance from Edward. Her husband initially proposed sending Despenser forces to secure her, but Isabella rejected this outright, instead requesting friendly troops. Rapidly retreating south with the Despensers, Edward failed to grasp the situation, resulting in Isabella finding herself and her household cut off from the south by the Scottish army, with the coastline patrolled by Flemish naval forces allied to the Scots. The situation was precarious and Isabella was forced to use a group of squires from her personal retinue to hold off the advancing army whilst other of her knights commandeered a ship. The fighting continued as Isabella and her household retreated onto the vessel, resulting in the death of two of her ladies-in-waiting. Once aboard, Isabella evaded the Flemish navy, landing further south and making her way to York. Isabella was furious both with Edward for, from her perspective, abandoning her to the Scots, and with Despensers for convincing Edward to retreat rather than sending help. For his part, Edward blamed Lewis de Beaumont, the Bishop of Durham and an ally of Isabella, for the fiasco.\nIsabella effectively separated from Edward from here onwards, leaving him to live with Hugh Despenser. At the end of 1322, Isabella left the court on a ten-month-long pilgrimage around England by herself. On her return in 1323, she visited Edward briefly, but was removed from the process of granting royal patronage. At the end of 1324, as tensions grew with France, Edward and the Despensers confiscated all of Isabella's lands, took over the running of her household and arrested and imprisoned all of her French staff. Isabella's youngest children were removed from her and placed into the custody of the Despensers. At this point, Isabella appeared to have realised that any hope of working with Edward was effectively over and begun to consider radical solutions.\nInvasion of England.\nBy 1325, Isabella was facing increasing pressure from Hugh Despenser the Younger, Edward's new royal favourite. With her lands in England seized, her children taken away from her and her household staff arrested, Isabella began to pursue other options. When her brother, King Charles IV of France, seized Edward's French possessions in 1325, she returned to France, initially as a delegate of the King charged with negotiating a peace treaty between the two nations. However, her presence in France became a focal point for the many nobles opposed to Edward's reign. Isabella gathered an army to oppose Edward, in alliance with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, whom she may have taken as a lover. Isabella and Mortimer returned to England with a mercenary army, seizing the country in a lightning campaign. The Despensers were executed and Edward was forced to abdicate \u2013 his eventual fate and possible murder remains a matter of considerable historical debate. Isabella ruled as regent until 1330 when her son Edward deposed Mortimer and began to rule directly in his own right.\nTensions in Gascony, 1323\u20131325.\nIsabella's husband Edward, as the Duke of Aquitaine, owed homage to the King of France for his lands in Gascony. Isabella's three brothers each had only short reigns, and Edward had successfully avoided paying homage to Louis X, and had paid homage to Philip V only under great pressure. Once Charles IV took up the throne, Edward had attempted to avoid doing so again, increasing tensions between the two. One of the elements in the disputes was the border province of Agenais, part of Gascony and in turn part of Aquitaine. Tensions rose in November 1323 after the construction of a bastide, a type of fortified town, in Saint-Sardos, part of the Agenais, by a French vassal. Gascon forces destroyed the bastide, and in turn Charles attacked the English-held Montpezat. The assault was unsuccessful, but in the subsequent War of Saint-Sardos, Isabella's uncle, Charles of Valois, successfully wrested Aquitaine from English control. By 1324, Charles declared Edward's lands forfeit and occupied the entirety of Aquitaine apart from the coastal areas.\nEdward was still unwilling to travel to France to give homage due to England's precarious condition. Criminal gangs were occupying most of the country and there had been an assassination plot against Edward and Hugh Despenser in 1324, with the famous magician John of Nottingham being hired to kill the pair using necromancy. Edward was deeply concerned that, should he leave England, even for a short while, the barons would take the chance to rise up and take their revenge on the Despensers. Charles sent a message through Pope John XXII to Edward, suggesting that he was willing to reverse the forfeiture of the lands if Edward ceded the Agenais and paid homage for the rest of the lands. The Pope proposed Isabella as an ambassador, and Isabella saw this as a perfect opportunity to resolve her situation with Edward and the Despensers.\nHaving promised to return to England by the summer, Isabella reached Paris in March 1325 and rapidly agreed to a truce in Gascony, under which Prince Edward, then thirteen years old, would come to France to give homage on his father's behalf. Prince Edward arrived in France, and gave homage in September. At this point, however, rather than returning, Isabella remained firmly in France with her son. Edward began to send urgent messages to the Pope and to Charles IV, expressing his concern about his wife's absence, but to no avail. Edward instructed Isabella to come home in September, but she expressed concern the young Despenser would try to kill her upon her arrival, or the Earl of Richmond. She also feared her own husband might attempt to have her killed. For his part, Charles replied that the, \"queen has come of her own will and may freely return if she wishes. But if she prefers to remain here, she is my sister and I refuse to expel her.\" Charles went on to refuse to return the lands in Aquitaine to Edward, resulting in a provisional agreement under which Edward resumed administration of the remaining English territories in early 1326 whilst France continued to occupy the rest.\nMeanwhile, the messages brought back by Edward's agent Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter and others portrayed a steadily worsening situation. They wrote that Isabella had publicly snubbed Stapledon; Edward's political enemies were gathering at the French court and threatening his emissaries; and that Isabella was dressed as a widow, claiming that Hugh Despenser had destroyed her marriage with Edward. Additionally, Isabella surrounded herself with mostly exiles, including Edmund of Kent, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, and her rumored lover Roger Mortimer.\nRoger Mortimer, 1325\u20131326.\nRoger Mortimer was a powerful Marcher lord, married to the wealthy heiress Joan de Geneville, and the father of twelve children. Mortimer had been imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 following his capture by Edward during the Despenser wars. Mortimer's uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk finally died in prison, but Mortimer managed to escape the Tower in August 1323: making a hole in the stone wall of his cell and then escaping onto the roof, before using rope ladders provided by an accomplice to get down to the River Thames. He then crossed the river and eventually made it to safety in France. Victorian writers suggested that, given later events, Isabella might have helped Mortimer escape. Additionally, some historians continue to argue that their relationship had already begun at this point, although most believe that there is no hard evidence for their having had a substantial relationship before meeting in Paris.\nIsabella was reintroduced to Mortimer in Paris by her cousin, Joan, Countess of Hainault, who appears to have approached Isabella suggesting a marital alliance between their two families, marrying Prince Edward to Joan's daughter, Philippa. Mortimer and Isabella may have begun a physical relationship from December 1325 onwards. If so, both Isabella and Mortimer were taking a huge risk in doing so. Female infidelity was a very serious offence in medieval Europe, as shown during the Tour de Nesle Affair. Both of Isabella's former French sisters-in-law had died by 1326 as a result of their imprisonment for charges of adultery, and their alleged lovers had been brutally executed. As a result, Isabella's motivation has been the subject of discussion by historians. Some believe that there was a strong sexual attraction between the two, that they shared an interest in the Arthurian legends, and that they both enjoyed fine art and high living. One historian has described their relationship as one of the \"great romances of the Middle Ages\" in spite of the fact that they are reputed to have murdered her husband. They also shared a common enemy: the regime of Edward II and the Despensers.\nTaking Prince Edward with them, Isabella and Mortimer left the French court in mid-1326 and travelled north to William I, Count of Hainaut. As Joan had suggested the previous year, Isabella betrothed Prince Edward to Philippa of Hainault, the daughter of the Count, in exchange for a substantial dowry. She then used this money, plus an earlier loan from Charles, to raise a mercenary army, scouring Brabant for men, which were added to a small force of Hainaut troops. William also provided eight men-of-war ships and various smaller vessels as part of the marriage arrangements. Although Edward was now fearing an invasion, secrecy remained key, and Isabella convinced William to detain envoys from Edward. Isabella also appears to have made a secret agreement with the Scots for the duration of the forthcoming campaign. On 22 September, Isabella, Mortimer and their modest force set sail for England.\nSeizure of power, 1326.\nHaving evaded Edward's fleet, which had been sent to intercept them, Isabella and Mortimer landed at Orwell on the east coast of England on 24 September with a small force; estimates of Isabella's army vary from between 300 and around 2,000 soldiers, with 1,500 being a popular middle figure. After a short period of confusion during which they attempted to work out where they had actually landed, Isabella moved quickly inland, dressed in her widow's clothes. The local levies mobilised to stop them immediately changed sides, and by the following day Isabella was in Bury St Edmunds and shortly afterwards had swept inland to Cambridge. Thomas, Earl of Norfolk, joined Isabella's forces and Henry of Lancaster \u2013 the brother of the late Thomas, and Isabella's uncle \u2013 also announced he was joining Isabella's faction, marching south to join her.\nBy the 27th, word of the invasion had reached the King and the Despensers in London. Edward issued orders to local sheriffs to mobilise opposition to Isabella and Mortimer, but London itself was becoming unsafe because of local unrest and Edward made plans to leave. Isabella struck west again, reaching Oxford on 2 October where she was \"greeted as a saviour\" \u2013 Adam Orleton, the Bishop of Hereford, emerged from hiding to give a lecture to the university on the evils of the Despensers. Edward fled London on the same day, heading west towards Wales. Isabella and Mortimer now had an effective alliance with the Lancastrian opposition to Edward, bringing all of his opponents into a single coalition.\nIsabella now marched south towards London, pausing at Dunstable, outside the city on 7 October. London was now in the hands of the mobs, although broadly allied to Isabella. Bishop Stapledon failed to realise the extent to which royal power had collapsed in the capital, and tried to intervene militarily to protect his property against rioters; a hated figure locally, he was promptly attacked and killed \u2013 his head was later sent to Isabella by her local supporters. Edward, meanwhile, was still fleeing west, reaching Gloucester by 9 October. Isabella responded by marching swiftly west herself in an attempt to cut him off, reaching Gloucester a week after Edward, who slipped across the border into Wales the same day.\nHugh Despenser the Elder continued to hold Bristol against Isabella and Mortimer, who placed it under siege between 18\u201326 October; when it fell, Isabella was able to recover her daughters Eleanor and Joan, who had been kept in the Despensers' custody. By now desperate and increasingly deserted by their court, Edward and Hugh Despenser the Younger attempted to sail to Lundy, a small island in the Bristol Channel, but the weather was against them and after several days they were forced to land back in Wales. With Bristol secure, Isabella moved her base of operations up to the border town of Hereford, from where she ordered Henry of Lancaster to locate and arrest her husband. After a fortnight of evading Isabella's forces in South Wales, Edward and Hugh were finally caught and arrested near Llantrisant on 16 November.\nThe retribution began immediately. Hugh Despenser the Elder had been captured at Bristol, and despite some attempts by Isabella to protect him, was promptly executed by his Lancastrian enemies \u2013 his body was hacked to pieces and fed to the local dogs. The remainder of the former regime were brought to Isabella. Edmund Fitzalan, a key supporter of Edward II and who had received many of Mortimer's confiscated lands in 1322, was executed on 17 November. Hugh Despenser the Younger was sentenced to be brutally executed on 24 November, and a huge crowd gathered in anticipation at seeing him die. They dragged him from his horse, stripped him, and scrawled Biblical verses against corruption and arrogance on his skin. He was then dragged into the city, presented to Queen Isabella, Roger Mortimer and the Lancastrians. Despenser was then condemned to hang as a thief, be castrated, and then to be drawn and quartered as a traitor, his quarters to be dispersed throughout England. Simon of Reading, one of the Despensers' supporters, was hanged next to him, on charges of insulting Isabella. Once the core of the Despenser regime had been executed, Isabella and Mortimer began to show restraint. Lesser nobles were pardoned and the clerks at the heart of the government, mostly appointed by the Despensers and Stapledon, were confirmed in office. All that was left now was the question of Edward II, still officially Isabella's legal husband and lawful king.\nDeath of Edward, 1327.\nAs an interim measure, Edward II was held in the custody of Henry of Lancaster, who surrendered Edward's Great Seal to Isabella. The situation remained tense, however; Isabella was clearly concerned about Edward's supporters staging a counter-coup, and in November she seized the Tower of London, appointed one of her supporters as mayor and convened a council of nobles and churchmen in Wallingford to discuss the fate of Edward. The council concluded that Edward would be legally deposed and placed under house arrest for the rest of his life. This was then confirmed at the next parliament, dominated by Isabella and Mortimer's followers. The session was held in January 1327, with Isabella's case being led by her supporter Adam Orleton, Bishop of Hereford. Isabella's son, Prince Edward, was confirmed as Edward III of England, with his mother appointed regent. Isabella's position was still precarious, as the legal basis for deposing Edward was doubtful and many lawyers of the day maintained that Edward II was still the rightful king, regardless of the declaration of the Parliament. The situation could be reversed at any moment and Edward II was known to be a vengeful ruler.\nEdward II's subsequent fate, and Isabella's role in it, remains hotly contested by historians. The minimally agreed version of events is that Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved from Kenilworth Castle in the Midlands to the safer location of Berkeley Castle in the Welsh borders, where he was put into the custody of Lord Berkeley. On 23 September, Isabella and Edward III were informed by messenger that Edward had died whilst imprisoned at the castle, because of a \"fatal accident\". Edward's body was apparently buried at Gloucester Cathedral, with his heart being given in a casket to Isabella. After the funeral, there were rumours for many years that Edward had survived and was really alive somewhere in Europe, some of which were captured in the famous Fieschi Letter written in the 1340s, although no concrete evidence ever emerged to support the allegations. There are, however, various historical interpretations of the events surrounding this basic sequence of events.\nAccording to legend, Isabella and Mortimer famously plotted to murder Edward in such a way as not to draw blame on themselves, sending a famous order (in ) which, depending on where the comma was inserted, could mean either \"Do not be afraid to kill Edward; it is good\" or \"Do not kill Edward; it is good to fear\". In actuality, there is little evidence of anyone deciding to have Edward assassinated, and none whatsoever of the note having been written. Similarly, accounts of Edward being killed with a red-hot poker have no strong contemporary sources to support them. The conventional 20th-century view has been that Edward did die at Berkeley Castle, either murdered on Isabella's orders or of ill-health brought on by his captivity, and that subsequent accounts of his survival were simply rumours, similar to those that surrounded Joan of Arc and other near contemporaries after their deaths.\nThree recent historians, however, have offered an alternative interpretation of events. Paul Doherty, drawing extensively on the Fieschi Letter of the 1340s, has argued that Edward in fact escaped from Berkeley Castle with the help of William Ockle, a knight whom Doherty argues subsequently pretended to be Edward in disguise around Europe, using the name \"William the Welshman\" to draw attention away from the real Edward himself. In this interpretation, a look-alike was buried at Gloucester. Ian Mortimer, focusing more on contemporary documents from 1327 itself, argues that Roger de Mortimer engineered a fake \"escape\" for Edward from Berkeley Castle; after this Edward was kept in Ireland, believing he was really evading Mortimer, before finally finding himself free, but politically unwelcome, after the fall of Isabella and Mortimer. In this version, Edward makes his way to Europe, before subsequently being buried at Gloucester. Finally, Alison Weir, again drawing on the Fieschi Letter, has recently argued that Edward II escaped his captors, killing one in the process, and lived as a hermit for many years; in this interpretation, the body in Gloucester Cathedral is of Edward's dead captor. In all of these versions, it is argued that it suited Isabella and Mortimer to publicly claim that Edward was dead, even if they were aware of the truth. Other historians, however, including David Carpenter, have criticised the methodology behind this revisionist approach and disagree with the conclusions.\nLater years.\nIsabella and Mortimer ruled together for four years, with Isabella's period as regent marked by the acquisition of huge sums of money and land. When their political alliance with the Lancastrians began to disintegrate, Isabella continued to support Mortimer. Isabella fell from power when her son, Edward III deposed Mortimer in a coup, taking back royal authority for himself. Unlike Mortimer, Isabella survived the transition of power, remaining a wealthy and influential member of the English court, albeit never returning directly to active politics.\nAs regent, 1326\u20131330.\nIsabella's regency lasted only four years, before the fragile political alliance that had brought her and Mortimer to power disintegrated. 1328 saw the marriage of Isabella's son, Edward III to Philippa of Hainault, as agreed before the invasion of 1326; the lavish ceremony was held in London to popular acclaim. Isabella and Mortimer had already begun a trend that continued over the next few years, in starting to accumulate huge wealth. With her lands restored to her, Isabella was already exceptionally rich, but she began to accumulate yet more. Within the first few weeks, Isabella had granted herself almost \u00a312,000; finding that Edward's royal treasury contained \u00a360,000, a rapid period of celebratory spending then ensued. Isabella soon awarded herself another \u00a320,000, allegedly to pay off foreign debts. At Edward III's coronation, Isabella then extended her land holdings from a value of \u00a34,400 each year to the huge sum of \u00a313,333, making her one of the largest landowners in the kingdom. Isabella also refused to hand over her dower lands to Philippa after her marriage to Edward III, in contravention of usual custom. Isabella's lavish lifestyle matched her new incomes. Mortimer, in effect her first minister, after a restrained beginning, also began to accumulate lands and titles at a tremendous rate, particularly in the Marcher territories.\nThe new regime also faced some key foreign policy dilemmas, which Isabella approached from a realist perspective. The first of these was the situation in Scotland, where Edward II's unsuccessful policies had left an unfinished, tremendously expensive war. Isabella was committed to bringing this issue to a conclusion by diplomatic means. Edward III initially opposed this policy, before eventually relenting, leading to the Treaty of Northampton. Under this treaty, Isabella's daughter Joan would marry David Bruce (heir apparent to the Scottish throne) and Edward III would renounce any claims on Scottish lands, in exchange for the promise of Scottish military aid against any enemy except the French, and \u00a320,000 in compensation for the raids across northern England. No compensation would be given to those earls who had lost their Scottish estates, and the compensation would be taken by Isabella. Although strategically successful and, historically at least, \"a successful piece of policy making\", Isabella's Scottish policy was by no means popular and contributed to the general sense of discontent with the regime. Secondly, the Gascon situation, still unresolved from Edward II's reign, also posed an issue. Isabella reopened negotiations in Paris, resulting in a peace treaty under which the bulk of Gascony, minus the Agenais, would be returned to England in exchange for a 50,000-mark penalty. The treaty was not popular in England because of the Agenais clause.\nHenry, Earl of Lancaster was amongst the first to break with Isabella and Mortimer. By 1327 Lancaster was irritated by Mortimer's behaviour and Isabella responded by beginning to sideline him from her government. Lancaster was furious over the passing of the Treaty of Northampton, and refused to attend court, mobilising support amongst the commoners of London. Isabella responded to the problems by undertaking a wide reform of royal administration and local law enforcement. In a move guaranteed to appeal to domestic opinion, Isabella also decided to pursue Edward III's claim on the French throne, sending her advisers to France to demand official recognition of his claim. The French nobility were unimpressed and, since Isabella lacked the funds to begin any military campaign, she began to court the opinion of France's neighbours, including proposing the marriage of her son John to the Castilian royal family.\nBy the end of 1328 the situation had descended into near civil war once again, with Lancaster mobilising his army against Isabella and Mortimer. In January 1329 Isabella's forces under Mortimer's command took Lancaster's stronghold of Leicester, followed by Bedford; Isabella \u2013 wearing armour, and mounted on a warhorse \u2013 and Edward III marched rapidly north, resulting in Lancaster's surrender. He escaped death but was subjected to a colossal fine, effectively crippling his power. Isabella was merciful to those who had aligned themselves with him, although some \u2013 such as her old supporter Henry de Beaumont, whose family had split from Isabella over the peace with Scotland, which had lost them huge land holdings in Scotland \u2013 fled to France.\nDespite Lancaster's defeat, however, discontent continued to grow. Edmund of Kent had sided with Isabella in 1326, but had since begun to question his decision and was edging back towards Edward II, his half-brother. Edmund of Kent was in conversations with other senior nobles questioning Isabella's rule, including Henry de Beaumont and Isabella de Vesci. Edmund was finally involved in a conspiracy in 1330, allegedly to restore Edward II, who, he claimed, was still alive: Isabella and Mortimer broke up the conspiracy, arresting Edmund and other supporters \u2013 including Simon Mepeham, Archbishop of Canterbury. Edmund may have expected a pardon, possibly from Edward III, but Isabella was insistent on his execution. The execution itself was a fiasco after the executioner refused to attend and Edmund of Kent had to be killed by a local dung-collector, who had been himself sentenced to death and was pardoned as a bribe to undertake the beheading. Isabella de Vesci escaped punishment, despite having been closely involved in the plot.\nMortimer's fall from power, 1330.\nBy mid-1330, Isabella and Mortimer's regime was increasingly insecure, and Isabella's son, Edward III, was growing frustrated at Mortimer's grip on power. Various historians, with different levels of confidence, have also suggested that in late 1329 Isabella became pregnant. A child of Mortimer's with royal blood would have proved both politically inconvenient for Isabella, and challenging to Edward's own position.\nEdward quietly assembled a body of support from the Church and selected nobles, whilst Isabella and Mortimer moved into Nottingham Castle for safety, surrounding themselves with loyal troops. In the autumn, Mortimer was investigating another plot against him, when he challenged a young noble, William Montagu, during an interrogation. Mortimer declared that his word had priority over the king's, an alarming statement that Montagu reported back to Edward. Edward was convinced that this was the moment to act, and on 19 October, Montagu led a force of twenty-three armed men into the castle by a secret tunnel. Up in the keep, Isabella, Mortimer and other council members were discussing how to arrest Montagu, when Montagu and his men appeared. Fighting broke out on the stairs and Mortimer was overwhelmed in his chamber. Isabella threw herself at Edward's feet, famously crying \"Fair son, have pity on gentle Mortimer!\" Lancastrian troops rapidly took the rest of the castle, leaving Edward in control of his own government for the first time.\nParliament was convened the next month, where Mortimer was put on trial for treason. Isabella was portrayed as an innocent bystander during the proceedings, and no mention of her sexual relationship with Mortimer was made public. Mortimer was executed at Tyburn, but Edward III showed leniency and he was not quartered or disembowelled.\nIn retirement, 1330\u20131358.\nAfter the coup, Isabella was initially transferred to Berkhamsted Castle, and then held under house arrest at Windsor Castle until 1332, when she then moved back to her own Castle Rising in Norfolk. Agnes Strickland, a Victorian historian, argued that Isabella suffered from occasional fits of madness during this period but modern interpretations suggest, at worst, a nervous breakdown following the death of Mortimer. Isabella remained extremely wealthy; despite being required to surrender most of her lands after losing power, in 1331 she was reassigned a yearly income of \u00a33000, which increased to \u00a34000 by 1337. She lived an expensive lifestyle in Norfolk, including minstrels, huntsmen, grooms and other luxuries, and was soon travelling again around England. In 1348, there were suggestions that she might travel to Paris to take part in peace negotiations, but eventually this plan was quashed. She was involved in the talks with Charles II of Navarre in 1358.\nAs the years went by, Isabella became very close to her daughter Joan, especially after Joan left her unfaithful husband, King David II of Scotland, who was imprisoned by her brother in the Tower of London at the time where she visited him once. Joan nursed her just before she died. She doted on her grandchildren, including Edward the Black Prince. She became increasingly interested in religion as she grew older, visiting a number of shrines. She remained, however, a gregarious member of the court, receiving constant visitors; amongst them appear to have been her friend Marie de St Pol, Countess of Pembroke, and her cousin Henry of Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster. King Edward and his children often visited her as well. She remained interested in Arthurian legends and jewellery; in 1358 she appeared at the St George's Day celebrations at Windsor wearing a dress made of silk, silver, 300 rubies, 1800 pearls and a circlet of gold. She may have developed an interest in astrology or geometry towards the end of her life, receiving various presents relating to these disciplines.\nIsabella took the nun's habit of the Poor Clares before she died on 22 August 1358 at Hertford Castle, and her body was returned to London for burial at the Franciscan church at Newgate, in a service overseen by Archbishop Simon Islip. She was buried in the mantle she had worn at her wedding and at her request, Edward's heart, placed into a casket thirty years before, was interred with her. Isabella left the bulk of her property, including Castle Rising, to her favourite grandson, the Black Prince, with some personal effects being granted to her daughter Joan.\nCultural depictions.\nLiterature and theatre.\nQueen Isabella appeared with a major role in Christopher Marlowe's play \"Edward II\" (c. 1592) and thereafter has been frequently used as a character in plays, books and films, often portrayed as beautiful but manipulative or wicked. Thomas Gray, the 18th-century poet, combined Marlowe's depiction of Isabella with William Shakespeare's description of Margaret of Anjou (the wife of Henry VI) as the \"She-Wolf of France\", to produce the anti-French poem \"The Bard\" (1757), in which Isabella rips apart the bowels of Edward II with her \"unrelenting fangs\". The \"She-Wolf\" epithet stuck, and Bertolt Brecht re-used it in \"The Life of Edward II of England\" (1923).\nFilm.\nIn Derek Jarman's film \"Edward II\" (1991), based on Marlowe's play, Isabella is portrayed (by actress Tilda Swinton) as a \"femme fatale\" whose thwarted love for Edward causes her to turn against him and steal his throne. In contrast to the negative depictions, Mel Gibson's film \"Braveheart\" (1995) portrays Isabella (played by the French actress Sophie Marceau) more sympathetically. In the film, an adult Isabella is fictionally depicted as having a romantic affair with the Scottish hero William Wallace. This version of the character takes significant artistic license from her real life counterpart. Additionally, Wallace is incorrectly suggested to be the father of her son, Edward III, despite Wallace's death being many years before Edward's birth.\nIssue.\nEdward and Isabella had four children, and she suffered at least one miscarriage. Their itineraries demonstrate that they were together nine months prior to the births of all four surviving offspring. Their children were:\nAncestry.\nIsabella was descended from Gytha of Wessex through King Andrew II of Hungary and thus brought the bloodline of the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, Harold Godwinson, back into the English royal family.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47622", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47622", "title": "Caernarfon", "text": "Town in Gwynedd, Wales\nCaernarfon (; ) is a royal town, community and port in Gwynedd, Wales. It has a population of 9,852 (with Caeathro). It lies along the A4871 road, on the eastern shore of the Menai Strait, opposite the island of Anglesey. The city of Bangor is to the north-east, while Snowdonia (Eryri) fringes Caernarfon to the east and south-east.\nAbundant natural resources in and around the Menai Strait enabled human habitation in prehistoric Britain. The Ordovices, a Celtic tribe, lived in the region during the period known as Roman Britain. The Roman fort Segontium was established around AD\u00a080 to subjugate the Ordovices during the Roman conquest of Britain. The Romans occupied the region until the end of Roman rule in Britain in 382, after which Caernarfon became part of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. In the late 11th century, William the Conqueror ordered the construction of a motte-and-bailey castle at Caernarfon as part of the Norman invasion of Wales. He was unsuccessful, and Wales remained independent until around 1283.\nIn the 13th century, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, ruler of Gwynedd, refused to pay homage to Edward I of England, prompting the English conquest of Gwynedd. This was followed by the construction of Caernarfon Castle, one of the largest and most imposing fortifications built by the English in Wales. In 1284, the English-style county of Caernarfonshire was established by the Statute of Rhuddlan; the same year, Caernarfon was made a borough, a county and market town, and the seat of English government in north Wales.\nThe ascent of the Welsh House of Tudor to the throne of England eased hostilities with the English and resulted in Caernarfon Castle falling into a state of disrepair. The town has flourished, leading to its status as a major tourist centre and seat of Gwynedd Council, with a thriving harbour and marina. Caernarfon has expanded beyond its medieval walls and experienced heavy suburbanisation. The community of Caernarfon's population includes the highest percentage of Welsh-speaking citizens anywhere in Wales. The status of Royal Borough was granted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1963 and amended to Royal Town in 1974. The castle and town walls are part of a World Heritage Site described as the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd.\nToponymy.\nThe town's name consists of three elements: , , and . \"Caer' means 'fortress\", in this case either the Roman fort of Segontium, which lies on the outskirts of the modern town, or the Norman castle erected near the mouth of the Afon Seiont. \"Arfon\" means \"opposite M\u00f4n (Anglesey)\", and the full name therefore means \"the fortress in the land opposite Anglesey\".\nThe earlier British and Romano-British settlement at Segontium was named ' (\"Fort Seiont\") after the river. It was also known as ' (\"Fortress of Constantine\"), after a belief that it was the capital of Gwynedd under Constantine, a supposed son of Saint Elen and the Emperor Magnus Maximus. Both names appear in the \"Historia Brittonum\" traditionally ascribed to Nennius. A medieval romance about Maximus and Elen, \"Macsen's Dream\", calls her home ' (\"Fort Seiontmouth\" or \"the fortress at the mouth of the Seiont\") and other pre-conquest poets such as Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd used the name '. A 1221 charter by Llywelyn the Great to the canons of Penmon priory on Anglesey mentions ', and the Welsh chronicle mentions both ' and \"\".\nThe town and the county named after it were officially spelled \"Carnarvon\" until 1926. At a meeting on 10 November 1925 the borough council resolved to ask the county council to change the spelling to \"Caernarvon\". The county council gave permission for the change of spelling for the name of the borough with effect from 14 January 1926, and at the same time decided to ask the government to also change the spelling of the county's name to Caernarvon. The government confirmed the change in the spelling of the county's name with effect from 1 July 1926.\nThe municipal borough was designated a royal borough in 1963. When the borough was abolished in 1974 the status of \"royal town\" was granted to the new community which succeeded it. The spelling of both borough and county remained \"Caernarvon\" until they were abolished in 1974. The spelling of the community's name was changed from \"Caernarvon\" to \"Caernarfon\" with effect from 2 June 1975 by order of Arfon Borough Council.\nHistory.\nCaernarfon contains a Roman fort, Segontium, and a Norman motte-and-bailey castle was built at the mouth of the River Seiont.\nIn 1283, King Edward I completed his conquest of Wales which he secured by a chain of castles and walled towns. The construction of a new stone Caernarfon Castle seems to have started as soon as the campaign had finished. Edward's architect, James of St. George, may well have modelled the castle on the walls of Constantinople, possibly being aware of the town's legendary associations. Edward's fourth son, Edward of Caernarfon, later Edward II of England, was born at the castle in April 1284 and made Prince of Wales in 1301. A story recorded in the 16th century suggests that the new prince was offered to the native Welsh on the premise \"that [he] was borne in Wales and could speake never a word of English\", however, there is no contemporary evidence to support this.\nCaernarfon was constituted a borough in 1284 by a charter of Edward I. The charter, which was confirmed on a number of occasions, appointed the mayor of the borough Constable of the Castle ex officio.\nIn 1911, David Lloyd George, then Member of Parliament (MP) for Caernarfon boroughs, which included various towns from Ll\u0177n to Conwy, agreed to the British royal family's idea of holding the investiture of the Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle. The ceremony took place on 13 July, with the royal family visiting Wales, and the future Edward VIII was duly invested.\nIn 1955, Caernarfon was in the running for the title of Capital of Wales on historical grounds but the town's campaign was heavily defeated in a ballot of Welsh local authorities, with 11 votes compared to Cardiff's 136. Cardiff therefore became the Welsh capital.\nOn 1 July 1969, the investiture ceremony for Charles, Prince of Wales was again held at Caernarfon Castle. The ceremony went ahead without incident despite terrorist threats and protests, which culminated in the death of two members of Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (Welsh Defence Movement), Alwyn Jones and George Taylor, who were killed when their bomb \u2013 intended for the railway line at Abergele in order to stop the British Royal Train \u2013 exploded prematurely. The bombing campaign (one in Abergele, two in Caernarfon and finally one on Llandudno Pier) was organised by the movement's leader, John Jenkins. He was later arrested after a tip-off and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment.\nIn July 2019, Caernarfon hosted a rally for Welsh independence. The event, organised by AUOB (All Under One Banner) Cymru, included a march through the town centre. Organisers estimated that roughly 8,000 people joined the march on the town square; local authorities confirmed at least 5,000 attendees. The event featured a number of speakers including Hardeep Singh Kohli, Evra Rose, Dafydd Iwan, Lleuwen Steffan, Si\u00f4n Jobbins, Beth Angell, Gwion Hallam, Meleri Davies and Elfed Wyn Jones. Talks covered criticism of Brexit and Westminster with advocating Welsh Independence.\nThe history of Caernarfon, as an example where the rise and fall of different civilizations can be seen from one hilltop, is discussed in John Michael Greer's book \"The Long Descent\". He writes of Caernarfon: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Spread out below us in an unexpected glory of sunlight was the whole recorded history of that little corner of the world. The ground beneath us still rippled with earthworks from the Celtic hill fort that guarded the Menai Strait more than two and a half millennia ago. The Roman fort that replaced it was now the dim brown mark of an old archaeological site on low hills off to the left. Edward I\u2019s great grey castle rose up in the middle foreground, and the high contrails of RAF jets on a training exercise out over the Irish Sea showed that the town\u2019s current overlords still maintained the old watch. Houses and shops from more than half a dozen centuries spread eastward as they rose through the waters of time, from the cramped medieval buildings of the old castle town straight ahead to the gaudy sign and sprawling parking lot of the supermarket back behind us.\nGeography.\nCaernarfon is situated on the southern bank of the Menai Strait facing the Isle of Anglesey. It is situated south-west of Bangor, north of Porthmadog and approximately west of Llanberis and Snowdonia National Park. The mouth of the River Seiont is in the town, creating a natural harbour where it flows into the Menai Strait. Caernarfon Castle stands at the mouth of the river. The A487 passes directly through Caernarfon, with Bangor to the north and Porthmadog to the south.\nAs the crow flies, the summit of Snowdon lies a little over to the southeast of the town centre.\nEconomy.\nCaernarfon's historical prominence and landmarks have made it a major tourist centre. As a result, many of the local businesses cater for the tourist trade. Caernarfon has numerous guest houses, inns and pubs, hotels, restaurants and shops. The majority of shops in the town are located either in the centre of town around Pool Street and Castle Square (Y Maes), on Doc Fictoria (Victoria Dock) or in Cei Llechi (Slate Quay). A number of shops are also located within the Town Walls.\nThe majority of the retail and residential section of Doc Fictoria was opened in 2008. The retail and residential section of Doc Fictoria is built directly beside a Blue Flag beach marina. It contains numerous homes, bars and bistros, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, an award-winning arts centre, a maritime museum and a range of shops and stores.\nPool Street and Castle Square contain a number of large, national retail shops and smaller independent stores. Pool Street is pedestrianised and serves as the town's main shopping street. Castle Square, commonly referred to as the 'Maes' by both Welsh and English speakers, is the market square of the town. A market is held every Saturday throughout the year and also on Mondays in the summer. The square was revamped at a cost of \u00a32.4 million in 2009. However, since its revamp the square has caused controversy due to traffic and parking difficulties. During the revamp, it was decided to remove barriers between traffic and pedestrians creating a 'shared space', to force drivers to be more considerate of pedestrians and other vehicles. This is the first use of this kind of arrangement in Wales, but it has been described by councillor Bob Anderson as being 'too ambiguous' for road users. Another controversy caused by the revamp of the Maes was that a historic old oak tree was taken down from outside the HSBC bank. When the Maes was re-opened in July 2009 by the local politician and Heritage Minister of Wales, Alun Ffred Jones AM, he said, \"the use of beautiful local slate is very prominent in the new Maes.\"\nThere are many old public houses serving the town, including The Four Alls, The Anglesey Arms Hotel, The Castle Hotel, The Crown, Morgan Lloyd, Pen Deitch and The Twthill Vaults. The oldest public house in Caernarfon is the Black Boy Inn, which remained in the same family for over 40 years until sold in 2003 to a local independent family business. The pub has stood inside Caernarfon's Town Walls since the 16th century, and many people claim to have seen ghosts within the building.\nIn and around the Town Walls are numerous restaurants, public houses and inns, and guest houses and hostels.\nGovernance.\nThere are two tiers of local government covering Caernarfon, at community (town) and county level: Caernarfon Town Council (Cyngor Tref Caernarfon) and Gwynedd Council (Cyngor Gwynedd). The town council is based at the Institute Building on Pavilion Hill (Allt Pafiliwn). As a royal town, the town council is allowed to style itself Caernarfon Royal Town Council (Cyngor Tref Frenhinol Caernarfon), which names it has used in the past, but as at 2024 it does not do so on its website or in council minutes. Gwynedd Council also has its headquarters in the town at the Council Offices on Shirehall Street.\nThe Caernarfon parliamentary constituency was a former electoral area centred on Caernarfon. Caernarfon is now part of the constituency of Dwyfor Meirionnydd in the UK Parliament, and Arfon in the Senedd. The town is twinned with Landerneau in Brittany., and Trelew in Chubut Province, Patagonia.\nAdministrative history.\nCaernarfon formed part of the ancient parish of Llanbeblig. The parish also included adjoining rural areas, particularly to the south-east where it extended to include the village of Waunfawr. The parish church was St Peblig's Church, to the south-east of the walled town. The church stood in relative isolation until the 20th century, but has since been surrounded by the town's suburbs.\nAs part of establishing the castle and fortified town, Edward I of England granted Caernarfon a charter making it a borough in 1284. The Statute of Rhuddlan in the same year created the new county of Caernarfonshire, with Caernarfon serving as county town.\nIn 1836 Caernarfon became a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. The Local Government Act 1894 directed that parishes were no longer allowed to straddle borough boundaries, and so the part of the parish of Llanbeblig outside the borough became the separate parish of Waunfawr (initially spelt Waenfawr).\nThe municipal borough of Caernarfon was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Caernarfon was created instead, covering the area of the abolished borough. District-level functions passed to Arfon Borough Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Gwynedd Council.\nDemography.\nThe population in 1841 was 8,001.\nThe population of Caernarfon Community Parish in 2001 was 9,611. Caernarfon residents are known colloquially as \"Cofis\". The word \"Cofi\" is also used locally in Caernarfon to describe the local Welsh dialect, notable for a number of words not in use elsewhere.\nWithin Wales, Gwynedd has the highest proportion of speakers of the Welsh language. The greatest concentration of Welsh speakers in Gwynedd is found in and around Caernarfon.\nAccording to the 2011 census, 85.8% of residents were born in Wales, one of the highest proportions in Gwynedd, and 77.0% reported a \"Welsh only\" national identity.\nChurches.\nSt Peblig's and Segontium Roman Fort.\nCaernarfon historically formed part of the parish of Llanbeblig, named after Saint Peblig, the son of Saint Elen and Macsen Wledig (Magnus Maximus). St Peblig's Church stands south-east of the walled town. It is built on an important early Christian site, itself built on a Roman Mithraeum or temple of Mithras. This was located close to the Segontium Roman Fort which lies away. A Roman altar was found in one of the walls of the church during 19th-century restoration work. The present church dates mainly from the 14th century and is built to a Cruciform architectural plan. A major restoration was undertaken in 1894. St Peblig's is a Grade I listed building.\nSt Mary's.\nSt Mary's Church was begun in 1307 as a chapel for the castle and garrison. It is built against the town wall, the Bell Tower acting as a vestry. The church was restored by Benjamin Dean Wyatt in 1811-1814. The exterior mainly reflects Wyatt's work, except its north and west walls which are \"Master James of St George's massive limestone masonry of 1284-1290\", but the arcades in the nave, and other internal elements, are medieval. The church is a Grade I listed building.\nLandmarks.\nCaernarfon Castle.\nThe present castle building was constructed between 1283 and 1330 by the order of King Edward I. The banded stonework and polygonal towers are thought to have been in imitation of the Walls of Constantinople. The impressive curtain wall with nine towers and two gatehouses survive largely intact. Caernarfon Castle is now under the care of Cadw and is open to the public. The castle includes the regimental museum of the Royal Welch Fusiliers.\nCaernarfon town walls.\nThe medieval town walls, including eight towers and two twin-towered gateways, form a complete circuit of around the old town and were built between 1283 and 1285. The walls are in the care of Cadw but only a small section is accessible to the public. The town walls and castle at Caernarfon were declared part of a World Heritage Site in 1986. According to UNESCO, the castle and walls together with other royal castles in Gwynedd \"are the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe\".\nCounty Hall, police station and prison.\nCaernarfon County Hall and the police station are two former municipal buildings which stand on Castle Ditch, facing the castle walls. Constructed in the mid-19th century, they were designed by John Fisher, the Caernarfonshire county surveyor in a Neoclassical style. They are both Grade I listed buildings. In the 20th century the buildings were vacated. The courthouse was replaced by the new Caernarfon Criminal Justice Centre on the former Segontium School site in Llanberis Road in 2009. The former county hall now operates as an entertainment venue, and the former police station as commercial offices. Adjacent to the old courthouse is the former Caernarfon Gaol which also closed in the early 20th century and converted into council offices.\nStatue of David Lloyd George.\nThe statue in Castle Square was sculpted by W. Goscombe John and was erected in 1921 when Lloyd George was prime minister. David Lloyd George was the Member of Parliament for the area from 1890 to 1945.\nThe Old Market Hall.\nThe Old Market Hall in Hole-in-the-Wall Street and Palace Street was built in 1832 as a corn market; the interior and roof were rebuilt later in that century. It is a Grade II listed building. It now acts as a pub and music venue.\nMorfa Common Park.\nA small Victorian urban park, Morfa was laid out in 1888. It stands to the south of the town, bordered by the 'Ysbyty Eryri' hospital [see below] at its southern edge. It is listed at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.\nOthers.\nCaernarfon has a small hospital, 'Ysbyty Eryri' (Snowdonia Hospital). The nearest large regional hospital is Ysbyty Gwynedd, in Bangor.\nCaernarfon Barracks was commissioned by John Lloyd, County Surveyor of Caernarfonshire, as a military headquarters and completed in 1855.\nTransport.\nSea.\nCaernarfon was at one time an important port, exporting slate from the Dyffryn Nantlle quarries. This traffic was facilitated from 1828 by the Nantlle Railway which predated far more widely known ventures such as the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the Ffestiniog Railway.\nRail.\nFive passenger stations have served the town. Caernarvon railway station opened in 1852 as the western terminus of the Bangor and Carnarvon Railway. This connected the town with the North Wales coast and the expanding national network. Carnarvon Castle railway station opened in 1856 as the northern passenger terminus of the 3ft 6in narrow gauge Nantlle Railway. This service ended in 1865 when the line being built from the south by the standard gauge Carnarvonshire Railway took over most of its trackbed. The Carnarvonshire Railway's temporary northern terminus was at Pant to the south of the town. Pant station opened in 1867. At the same time, the Carnarvon and Llanberis Railway built its line from Llanberis to Caernarfon. Its temporary western terminus was called Carnarvon (Morfa). It opened in 1869 near the modern road bridges over the Afon Seiont. For a short period, therefore, Caernarfon had three terminating stations on its edges. Records are contradictory, but this ended in either 1870 or 1871 when they were connected by a line through the town using the tunnel which survives, having been converted in 1995 for road traffic. When the through route was opened Pant and Morfa stations closed and the original station became the town's only station. The London and North Western Railway also took over all the lines mentioned, leaving one station and one service provider by 1871.\nThe services to Llanberis and south to Afon Wen closed progressively from the 1930s, with tracks being lifted in the mid-1960s, but Caernarvon station survived until 1970, with Bangor to Caernarvon one of the last passenger services to be closed under the Beeching Axe; it is now the site of a Morrisons supermarket. In November 2020 the Welsh Government stated 'further consideration' should be given to reopening the line. The fifth station was opened in 1997 on the old trackbed in St. Helen's Road. It is the northern terminus of the 2ft narrow gauge Rheilffordd Eryri / Welsh Highland Railway. Work began on a permanent station for the town in February 2017. The new station opened to passengers in the Spring of 2019. Heritage steam services provide links to Porthmadog, where passengers can change for services on the Ffestiniog Railway to Blaenau Ffestiniog.\nBus.\nBus services in the town are provided by Arriva Buses Wales, and a number of smaller, local operators. Longer distance, cross-country services are operated by Lloyds Coaches, and connect the town with Bangor to the north, and Aberystwyth via Porthmadog, Dolgellau and Machynlleth to the south. These services are part of the Welsh Government funded TrawsCymru network.\nRoad.\nThe A487 trunk road bisects the town, providing access to major urban areas along the North Wales coast and the Port of Holyhead, via the A55 expressway. Llanberis at the foot of Snowdon can be reached via the A4086, which heads east out of the town towards Capel Curig.\nBike.\nHeading north out of the town is the L\u00f4n Las Menai cycle path to nearby Y Felinheli. Heading south out of the town is the L\u00f4n Eifion cycle path, which leads to Bryncir, near Criccieth. The route provides views into the Snowdonia mountains, down along the Ll\u0177n Peninsula and across to the Isle of Anglesey.\nAir.\nCaernarfon Airport is to the southwest, and offers pleasure flights and an aviation museum.\nFoot.\nThe Aber Swing Bridge is a pedestrian swing bridge that crosses over the Afon Seiont to connect pedestrians from the foreshore to the Watergate entrance in the centre of Caernarfon by the Caernarfon Castle.\nEducation.\nThere are four primary schools in Caernarfon, Ysgol yr Hendre being the largest. The others are Ysgol y Gelli, Ysgol Santes Helen and Ysgol Maesincla. Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen is the single secondary school serving Caernarfon and the surrounding areas and currently has between 900 and 1000 pupils from ages 11 to 18. Ysgol Pendalar is a school for children with special needs. Coleg Menai is a further education college for adult learners.\n\"See \"\nSport.\nCaernarfon Town F.C. () is a Welsh football club based in the town, which currently plays in the Cymru Premier, the top level for football in Wales. The club is nicknamed \"the Canaries\" because of its yellow and green strip. Caernarfon Town plays at The Oval which has a capacity of 3000 people and 250 seated people.\nCulture.\nCaernarfon hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1862, 1894, 1906, 1921, 1935, 1959 and 1979. Unofficial National Eisteddfod events were also held there in 1877 and 1880. Caernarfon also hosted the 30th annual Celtic Media Festival in March 2009. Cultural destinations include Galeri and Oriel Pendeitsh. Galeri is a creative enterprise centre that houses a gallery, a concert hall, a cinema, a number of companies, and a range of other creative and cultural spaces. Oriel Pendeitsh is a ground-floor exhibition space adjoining the Tourist Information Centre opposite Caernarfon Castle. The gallery has a varied and changing programme of exhibitions throughout the year.\nFood festival.\nThe Caernarfon Food Festival takes place in the town's streets including The Slate Quay (Cei Llechi) and Castle Square (the Maes), which is pedestrianised for the event. Stalls are also located along the promenade next to the Menai Strait towards the marina and Doc Fictoria.\nThe festival was formed in 2015 as a result of public consultation within the town. The first festival was held in 2016. It is organised by the Caernarfon Food Festival Group which is made up of local volunteers who hold regular meetings to plan each festival. The festival has a number of support groups, including a content group, sponsorship group, technical group, communication group and volunteer group. These groups feed into the main group's monthly meetings. The festival logo was inspired by contributions from pupils at Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen and designed by Iestyn Lloyd of Cwmni Da. The festival has been supported by Welsh Government through the Food Festival Grant Scheme and was highly commended by Food Awards Wales in 2019. Car parking is provided at the Slate Quay (Cei Llechi) and at other car parks around the town while the Welsh Highland Railway provides transport from Porthmadog. Cycle access is by the cycle tracks along the disused railway lines which include L\u00f4n Las Eifion, which runs from Porthmadog, by-passing Penygroes and on to Caernarfon, L\u00f4n Las Menai from Y Felinheli to Caernarfon and L\u00f4n Las Peris from Llanberis to Caernarfon.\nFreedom of the Town.\nThe following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Town of Caernarfon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The FTAA came to public attention during the third summit, held in Quebec City in 2001, as the meeting was targeted by large anti-corporatization and anti-globalization protests. The Miami negotiations in 2003 met similar protests, though not as large.\nIn the last round of negotiations, trade ministers from 34 countries met in Miami, Florida, in the United States, in November 2003 to discuss the proposal. The proposed agreement was an extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Discussions have faltered over similar points as the Doha Development Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) talks; developed nations sought expanded trade in services and increased intellectual property rights, while less developed nations sought an end to agricultural subsidies and free trade in agricultural goods. Similar to the WTO talks, Brazil took a leadership role among the less developed nations, while the United States took a similar role for the developed nations.\nDisagreements.\nIn previous negotiations, the United States had pushed for a single comprehensive agreement to reduce trade barriers for goods, while increasing intellectual property protection. Specific intellectual property protections could include Digital Millennium Copyright Act style copyright protections similar to the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Another protection would likely have restricted the importation or cross importation of pharmaceuticals, similar to the proposed agreement between the United States and Canada. Brazil posed a three-track approach that called for a series of bilateral agreements to reduce specific tariffs on goods, a hemispheric pact on rules of origin, and a dispute resolution process Brazil proposed to omit the more controversial issues from the FTA, leaving them to the WTO.\nThe location of the FTA Secretariat was to have been determined in 2005. The contending cities were: Atlanta, Chicago, Galveston, Houston, San Juan, and Miami in the United States; Canc\u00fan and Puebla in Mexico; Panama City, Panama; and Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The U.S. city of Colorado Springs also submitted its candidacy in the early days but subsequently withdrew. Miami, Panama City and Puebla served successively an interim secretariat headquarters during the negotiation process.\nThe last summit was held at Mar del Plata, Argentina, in November 2005, but no agreement on FTA was reached. Of the 39 countries present at the negotiations, 20 pledged to meet again in 2006 to resume negotiations, but no meeting took place. The failure of the Mar del Plata summit to establish a comprehensive FTA agenda augured poorly.\nCurrent status.\nThe FTAA missed the targeted deadline of 2005, which followed the stalling of useful negotiations of the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005. Over the next few years, some governments, most notably the United States, not wanting to lose any chance of hemispheric trade expansion moved in the direction of establishing a series of bilateral trade deals. The leaders planned further discussions at the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia in 2012, but these discussions did not take place.\nAs of 2022, U.S. trade policy reflected a withdrawal from a reliance on trade agreements, with a preference for smaller bilateral deals.\nPlanned membership.\nThe following countries were planned to be part of the Free Trade Area of the Americas:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSupport and opposition.\nA vocal critic of the FTAA was Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who has described it as an \"annexation plan\" and a \"tool of imperialism\" for the exploitation of South America. As a counterproposal to this initiative, Ch\u00e1vez promoted the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (\"Alianza Bolivariana para las Am\u00e9ricas\", ALBA) which emphasizes energy and infrastructure agreements among underdeveloped American nations. Evo Morales of Bolivia has referred to the U.S.-backed Free Trade Area of the Americas, as \"an agreement to legalize the colonization of the Americas\".\nOn the other hand, the then presidents of Brazil, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and Argentina, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, have stated that they do not oppose the FTAA but they do demand that the agreement provide for the elimination of U.S. agriculture subsidies, the provision of effective access to foreign markets and further consideration towards the needs and sensibilities of its members.\nOne of the most contentious issues of the treaty proposed by the United States is with concerns to patents and copyrights. Critics claim that if the measures proposed by the United States were implemented and applied this would reduce scientific research in underdeveloped countries of the Americas. On the Council of Canadians web site, Maude Barlow wrote: \"This agreement sets enforceable global rules on patents, copyrights and trademark. It has gone far beyond its initial scope of protecting original inventions or cultural products and now permits the practice of patenting plants and animal forms as well as seeds. It promotes the private rights of corporations over local communities and their genetic heritage and traditional medicines\".\nOn the weekend of April 20, 2001, the 3rd Summit of the Americas was a summit held in Quebec City, Canada. This international meeting was a round of negotiations regarding a proposed FTAA.\nAgreements.\nThere are currently 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere, stretching from Canada to Chile that still have the FTAA as a long-term goal. The Implementation of a full multilateral FTAA between all parties could be made possible by enlargement of existing agreements. At this point Agreements within the Area of the Americas include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47624", "revid": "12931721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47624", "title": "Pawn (chess)", "text": "Chess piece\nThe pawn (\u2659, \u265f) is the most numerous and weakest piece in the game of chess. It can move one vacant square directly forward, or one or two vacant squares directly forward on its first move, and can capture one square diagonally forward. Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of their second &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;rank&lt;/dfn&gt;. The white pawns start on a2 through h2, while the black pawns start on a7 through h7.\nIndividual pawns are often referred to by the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;file&lt;/dfn&gt; on which they stand. For example, one speaks of \"White's f-pawn\" or \"Black's b-pawn\". It is also common to refer to a \"rook pawn\", meaning any pawn on the a- or h-files, a \"knight pawn\" (on the b- or g-files), a \"bishop pawn\" (on the c- or f-files), a \"queen pawn\" (on the d-file), a \"king pawn\" (on the e-file), and a \"central pawn\" (on the d- or e-files).\nPlacement and movement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEach player begins the game with eight pawns placed along their second rank.\nA pawn may move by vertically advancing to a vacant square ahead. The first time a pawn moves, it has the additional option of vertically advancing two squares, provided that both squares are vacant. Unlike other pieces, the pawn can only move forwards. In the second diagram, the pawn on c4 can move to c5, and the pawn on e2 can move to either e3 or e4.\nCapturing.\nUnlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same way that it moves. A pawn captures by moving diagonally forward one square to the left or right, either replacing an enemy piece on its square (first diagram) or capturing \"en passant\" (second diagram).&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEn passant.\nAn \"en passant\" (French: , lit. \"in passing\") capture can occur after a pawn moves two squares and the square it passes over is attacked by an enemy pawn. The enemy pawn is entitled to capture the moved pawn \"in passing\" as if the latter had advanced only one square. The capturing pawn moves to the square over which the moved pawn passed, removing it from the board.\nAn \"en passant\" capture can only be done on the move immediately following the double-step pawn advance. It is the only capture in which the capturing piece does not move to the square of the captured piece.\nPromotion.\nA pawn that advances to its &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;last rank&lt;/dfn&gt; is \"promoted\" to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. The pawn is replaced by the new piece on the same move. The choice of promotion is not limited to pieces that have been captured; thus, a player could, in theory, have as many as nine queens, ten rooks, ten bishops, or ten knights on the board. Typically, a pawn to promoted to a queen, the most powerful piece. Promotion to a queen is known as \"queening\", while promotion to any other piece is known as \"underpromotion\". Reasons for underpromotion include tactical positions involving a knight check, and avoiding stalemate.\nStrategy.\nPawn structure.\nThe \"pawn structure\", the configuration of pawns on the chessboard, determines the strategic flavor of a game. While other pieces can usually be moved to more favorable positions if they are temporarily badly placed, a poorly positioned pawn often cannot be so relocated. In addition, being the most numerous piece, the pawn structure restricts and directs the piece movements of each side.\nBecause pawns capture diagonally and can be blocked from advancing, opposing pawns can become locked in diagonal &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;pawn chains&lt;/dfn&gt; of two or more pawns of each color, where each player controls squares of one color. In the diagram, Black and White have locked their d- and e-pawns.\nHere, White has a long-term &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;space&lt;/dfn&gt; advantage. White will have an easier time than Black in finding good squares for their pieces, particularly with an eye to the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;kingside&lt;/dfn&gt;. Black, in contrast, suffers from a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;bad bishop&lt;/dfn&gt; on c8, which is prevented by the black pawns from finding a good square or helping out on the kingside. On the other hand, White's central pawns are somewhat &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;overextended&lt;/dfn&gt; and vulnerable to attack. Black can undermine the white pawn chain with an immediate ...c5 and perhaps a later ...f6.\nIsolated pawn.\nPawns on adjacent files can support each other in attack and defense. A pawn that has no friendly pawns in adjacent files is an \"isolated pawn\". The square in front of an isolated pawn may become an enduring weakness. Any piece placed directly in front not only blocks the advance of that pawn but also cannot be driven away by other pawns.\nIn the diagram, Black has an isolated pawn on d5. If all the pieces except the kings and pawns were removed, the weakness of that pawn might prove fatal to Black in the endgame. In the middlegame, however, Black has slightly more freedom of movement than White and may be able to trade off the isolated pawn before an endgame ensues.\nPassed pawn.\nA pawn that cannot be blocked or captured by enemy pawns in its path to promotion is a \"passed pawn\". Because endgames are often won by the player who can promote a pawn first, having a passed pawn in an endgame can be decisive\u00a0\u2013 especially a protected passed pawn (a passed pawn protected by a pawn). In this vein, a pawn \"majority\", a greater number of pawns belonging to one player on one side of the chessboard, is strategically important because it can often be converted into a passed pawn.\nIn the diagram, White has a \"protected\" passed pawn on c5 and Black has an \"outside\" passed pawn on h5. This position might appear roughly equal, because each side has a king and three pawns, and the positions of the kings are about equal. In truth, White wins this endgame on the strength of the protected passed pawn, regardless which player moves first. The black king cannot be on both sides of the board at once\u00a0\u2013 to defend the isolated h-pawn and to stop White's c-pawn from advancing to promotion. Thus White can capture the h-pawn and then win the game.\nDoubled pawn.\nAfter a capture with a pawn, a player may end up with two pawns on the same &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;file&lt;/dfn&gt;, called \"doubled pawns\". Doubled pawns are substantially weaker than pawns that are side by side, because they cannot defend each other or both be defended by adjacent pawns, and the front pawn blocks the advance of the back one. In the diagram, the doubled c-pawns are a strategic disadvantage for Black.\nThere are situations where doubled pawns confer some advantage; for example, the guarding of consecutive squares in a file by the pawns prevents an invasion by the opponent's pieces, and the side with doubled pawns typically has additional open files for rooks.\nPawns that are both doubled and isolated are typically a tangible weakness. A single piece or pawn in front of doubled isolated pawns blocks both of them, and cannot be easily dislodged. It is rare for a player to have three pawns in a file, i.e. \"tripled\" pawns.\nWrong rook pawn.\nIn chess endgames with a bishop, a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;rook pawn&lt;/dfn&gt; may be the \"wrong rook pawn\", depending on the square-color of the bishop. This causes some positions to be draws that would otherwise be wins.\nHistory.\nThe pawn has its origins in the oldest version of chess, chaturanga, and it is present in all other significant versions of the game as well. In chaturanga, this piece could move one square directly forward and could capture one square diagonally forward.\nIn medieval chess, as an attempt to make the pieces more interesting, each pawn was given the name of a commoner's occupation:\nThe most famous example of this is found in the second book ever printed in the English language, \"The Game and Playe of the Chesse\". This book, printed by William Caxton, was viewed to be as much a political commentary on society as a chess book. \nThe ability to move two spaces and the related ability to capture \"en passant\" were introduced in 15th-century Europe; the \"en passant\" capture spread to various regions throughout its history. The \"en passant\" capture intends to prevent a pawn on its initial square from safely bypassing a square controlled by an enemy pawn. The rule for promotion has changed throughout its history.\nEtymology and word usage.\nThe term \"pawn\" is derived from the Old French word \"paon\", which comes from the Medieval Latin term for \"foot soldier\" and is cognate with \"peon\". In most other languages, the word for pawn is similarly derived from \"paon\" (e.g., \"pionek\" in Polish), its Latin ancestor or some other word for foot soldier. In some languages the term for pawn is a name meaning \"peasant\" or \"farmer\", reflecting how the lower orders were conscripted as footsoldiers in wartime: Hungarian , Slovene , German , Danish/Norwegian/Swedish \"bonde\", Latvian . In Irish, the term ', a diminutive of ' (\"chess\") is sometimes used, though the term \"ceithearnach\" (\"foot soldier\") is also used. In Thai the pawn is called \u0e40\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e49\u0e22 (\"b\u00eeia\"), which signifies a cowrie shell or a coin of little value. In Turkish the pawn is called \"\", borrowed from the French word in the 19th\u00a0century.\nOutside of the game of chess, \"pawn\" is often taken to mean \"one who is manipulated to serve another's purpose\". Because the pawn is the weakest piece, it is often used metaphorically to indicate unimportance or outright disposability, only having utility in the ability to be controlled; for example, \"She's only a pawn in their game.\"\nUnicode.\nUnicode defines three codepoints for a pawn:\n\u2659 U+2659 White Chess Pawn\n\u265f U+265F Black Chess Pawn\n\ud83e\ude05 U+1FA05 Neutral Chess Pawn\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47625", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47625", "title": "Yarkovsky effect", "text": "Force acting on a rotating body in space\nThe Yarkovsky effect is a force acting on a rotating body in space caused by the anisotropic emission of thermal photons, which carry momentum. It is usually considered in relation to meteoroids or small asteroids (about 10\u00a0cm to 10\u00a0km in diameter), as its influence is most significant for these bodies.\nHistory of discovery.\nThe effect was discovered by the Polish-Russian civil engineer Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky (1844\u20131902), who worked in Russia on scientific problems in his spare time. Writing in a pamphlet around the year 1900, Yarkovsky noted that the daily heating of a rotating object in space would cause it to experience a force that, while tiny, could lead to large long-term effects in the orbits of small bodies, especially meteoroids and small asteroids. Yarkovsky's insight would have been forgotten had it not been for the Estonian astronomer Ernst J. \u00d6pik (1893\u20131985), who read Yarkovsky's pamphlet sometime around 1909. Decades later, \u00d6pik, recalling the pamphlet from memory, discussed the possible importance of the Yarkovsky effect on movement of meteoroids about the Solar System.\nMechanism.\nThe Yarkovsky effect is a consequence of the fact that change in the temperature of an object warmed by radiation (and therefore the intensity of thermal radiation from the object) lags behind changes in the incoming radiation. That is, the surface of the object takes time to become warm when first illuminated, and takes time to cool down when illumination stops. In general there are two components to the effect:\nIn general, the effect is size-dependent, and will affect the semi-major axis of smaller asteroids, while leaving large asteroids practically unaffected. For kilometre-sized asteroids, the Yarkovsky effect is minuscule over short periods: the force on asteroid 6489 Golevka has been estimated at 0.25 newtons, for a net acceleration of 10\u221212\u00a0m/s2. But it is steady; over millions of years an asteroid's orbit can be perturbed enough to transport it from the asteroid belt to the inner Solar System.\nThe mechanism is more complicated for bodies in strongly eccentric orbits.\nMeasurement.\nThe effect was first measured in 1991\u20132003 on the asteroid 6489 Golevka. The asteroid drifted 15\u00a0km from its predicted position over twelve years (the orbit was established with great precision by a series of radar observations in 1991, 1995, and 1999 from the Arecibo radio telescope).\nWithout direct measurement, it is very hard to predict the exact result of the Yarkovsky effect on a given asteroid's orbit. This is because the magnitude of the effect depends on many variables that are hard to determine from the limited observational information that is available. These include the exact shape of the asteroid, its orientation, and its albedo. Calculations are further complicated by the effects of shadowing and thermal \"reillumination\", whether caused by local craters or a possible overall concave shape. The Yarkovsky effect also competes with radiation pressure, whose net effect may cause similar small long-term forces for bodies with albedo variations or non-spherical shapes.\nAs an example, even for the simple case of the pure seasonal Yarkovsky effect on a spherical body in a circular orbit with 90\u00b0 obliquity, semi-major axis changes could differ by as much as a factor of two between the case of a uniform albedo and the case of a strong north-south albedo asymmetry. Depending on the object's orbit and spin axis, the Yarkovsky change of the semi-major axis may be reversed simply by changing from a spherical to a non-spherical shape.\nDespite these difficulties, using the Yarkovsky effect is one scenario under investigation to alter the course of potentially Earth-impacting near-Earth asteroids. Possible asteroid deflection strategies include \"painting\" the surface of the asteroid or focusing solar radiation onto the asteroid to alter the intensity of the Yarkovsky effect and so alter the orbit of the asteroid away from a collision with Earth. The OSIRIS-REx mission, launched in September 2016, studied the Yarkovsky effect on asteroid Bennu.\nIn 2020, astronomers confirmed Yarkovsky acceleration of the asteroid 99942 Apophis. The findings are relevant to asteroid impact avoidance as 99942 Apophis was thought to have a very small chance of Earth impact in 2068, and the Yarkovsky effect was a significant source of prediction uncertainty. In 2021, a multidisciplinary professional-amateur collaboration combined Gaia satellite and ground-based radar measurements with amateur stellar occultation observations to further refine 99942 Apophis's orbit and measure the Yarkovsky acceleration with high precision, to within 0.5%. With these data, astronomers were able to eliminate the possibility of a collision with the Earth for at least the next 100 years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Llywelyn was the son of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ap Iorwerth and grandson of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (also known as Llywelyn the Great, or Llywelyn I), and he was one of the last native and independent princes of Wales before its conquest by Edward I of England and English rule in Wales that followed, until Owain Glynd\u0175r held the title during his rebellion of 1400\u20131415.\nGenealogy and early life.\nLlywelyn was the second of the four sons of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, the eldest son of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, and Senana ferch Caradog, the daughter of Caradoc ap Thomas ap Rhodri, Lord of Anglesey.\nThe eldest was Owain Goch ap Gruffudd and there were two younger brothers, Dafydd ap Gruffydd and Rhodri ap Gruffudd. He is first heard of holding lands in the Vale of Clwyd around 1244.\nFollowing his grandfather's death in 1240, Llywelyn's uncle, Dafydd ap Llywelyn (who was Llywelyn the Great's eldest legitimate son), succeeded him as ruler of Gwynedd. At this time, Llywelyn went on crusade with Richard of Cornwall, brother of Henry III of England.\nLlywelyn's father, Gruffudd (who was Llywelyn's eldest son but illegitimate), and his brother, Owain, were initially kept prisoner by Dafydd, then transferred into the custody of King Henry III of England. Gruffudd died in 1244 from a fall while trying to escape from his cell at the top of the Tower of London. The window from which he attempted to escape the Tower was bricked up and can still be seen to this day. King Henry could no longer use Gruffudd against him, war broke out between Dafydd II and King Henry in 1245. Llywelyn supported his uncle in the savage fighting that followed. Owain, meanwhile, was freed by Henry III after his father's death and was given a portion of Snowdonia (Eryri) by Henry at the treaty of Woodstock in 1247.\nEarly reign.\nGwynedd.\nLlywelyn and Owain came to terms with King Henry III and in 1247 signed the Treaty of Woodstock at Woodstock Palace. The terms they were forced to accept restricted them to the west of Conwy (Gwynedd Uwch Conwy) around Snowdonia and Anglesey, which was divided between them. The other half of Gwynedd east of Conwy known as the Perfeddwlad was taken over by King Henry.\nWhen Dafydd ap Gruffydd came of age, King Henry accepted his homage and announced his intention to give him part of the already reduced Gwynedd. Llywelyn refused to accept this and Owain and Dafydd formed an alliance against him. This led to the Battle of Bryn Derwin in June 1255. Llywelyn defeated Owain and Dafydd and captured them, thereby becoming the sole ruler of Gwynedd Uwch Conwy. Llywelyn now looked to expand his area of control. The population of Gwynedd Is Conwy resented English rule. This area, also known as \"Perfeddwlad\" (meaning \"middle land\") had been given by King Henry to his son Edward and during the summer of 1256, he visited the area but failed to deal with grievances against the rule of his officers. An appeal was made to Llywelyn, who, that November, crossed the River Conwy with an army, accompanied by his brother, Dafydd, whom he had released from prison. By early December, Llywelyn controlled all of Gwynedd Is Conwy, apart from the royal castle at Dyserth, as a reward for his support and dispossessing his brother-in-law, Rhys Fychan, who supported the king. An English army led by Stephen Bauzan invaded to try to restore Rhys Fychan but was decisively defeated by Welsh forces at the Battle of Cadfan in June 1257, with Rhys having previously slipped away to make his peace with Llywelyn.\nAll of Wales.\nDuring 1257, Llywelyn aggressively pursued his interests and gained control of lands in Gwrtheyrnion, driving out his cousin, the Anglo-Norman, Roger Mortimer. Then to Powys, which affected his fellow Welshman, Gwenwynwyn, and Deheubarth in South Wales, helping his kin against Norman control going as far as the Bristol Channel, leaving a trail of destruction during the time of Lent. Despite liberating his fellow Welsh folk, some would return to siding with the English upon his departure. The English retaliated by mobilising a force from Scotland to Deganwy in Wales but did not cross into Conwy, which was officially Llywelyn's Welsh territory. Henry III waited for an Irish naval force to attack on land from the west to corner Llywelyn, however, his force never arrived. The acts of aggression were followed by a peace truce for 1258, of which the Marcher Lords, did not completely abide by.\nThe leader of Deheubarth, Rhys Fychan now accepted Llywelyn as overlord, but this caused problems for Llywelyn, as Rhys's lands had already been given to Maredudd. Llywelyn restored his lands to Rhys, but the king's envoys approached Maredudd and offered him Rhys's lands if he would change sides. Maredudd paid homage to Henry in late 1257. After the betrayal, in 1259, Llywelyn jailed Maredudd until Christmas in Criccieth Castle. Maredudd was released only for him to surrender a son as hostage, it was then Dinefwr became a vassal kingdom of Gwynedd.\nIn early 1258, Llywelyn was using the title Prince of Wales, first used in an agreement between Llywelyn and his supporters and the Scottish nobility associated with the Comyn family. The English Crown refused to recognise this title however, and, in 1263, Llywelyn's brother, Dafydd was hostile against the Prince and submitted himself to King Henry.\nThen in January 1260, Llywelyn pursued his interests internally by dislodging Roger Mortimer of Buellt. This would be an act of war which would be followed by an English decree which was summoned in Oxford on 1 August. Armies assembled at Shrewsbury and Chester with the sole purpose of removing Llywelyn from power. However, the English could not come to an agreement in government over the matter, and a truce was enacted again for a further 2 years. After 2 years the English continued castle building which caused a revolt from the Welsh, who in turn requested and were assisted by Llywelyn in defending their lands in Maelienydd. After, Llywelyn continued his expansion into South Wales to the Lordship of Brecon, where he received fealty from the Welsh who too ousted their Anglo-Norman Marcher Lord Mortimer. This success brought him to the attention of the Montfort family, which would start a new era for Gwynedd and Llywelyn. The change in territory forced Edward I to return to Wales for the first time since 1254.\nOn 12 December 1263, in the commote of Ystumanner, Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn (Mathrafal, Powys Wenwynwyn) did homage and swore fealty to Llywelyn. In return he was made a vassal lord and the lands taken from him by Llywelyn about six years earlier were restored to him.\nSupremacy in Wales.\nLlywelyn's interests were now not solely excluded to Wales. In England, Simon de Montfort (the Younger) defeated the king's supporters at the Battle of Lewes in 1264 (Second Barons' War), capturing the king and Lord Edward. Llywelyn began negotiations with de Montfort, and in 1265, offered him 25,000 marks in exchange for a permanent peace, 5,000 of which immediately and then 3,000 a year thereafter. The Treaty of Pipton, 22 June 1265, established an alliance between Llywelyn and de Montfort, although Pope Clement IV warned Llywelyn against allying himself with the excommunicated Montfort. As well as the rule of the whole Principality, Llywelyn was offered the castles of Maud, Hawarden, Ellesmere and Montgomery. Thus, Llywelyn's right to rule the Principality of Wales as the hereditary Prince of Wales would be acknowledged. De Montfort was to die at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, a battle in which Llywelyn took no part. \nAfter Simon de Montfort's death, Llywelyn launched a campaign in order to rapidly gain a bargaining position before King Henry had fully recovered. In 1265, he routed the combined armies of Hamo le Strange and Maurice FitzGerald in North Wales. Llywelyn then moved on to Montgomery, and routed Roger Mortimer's army. With these victories and the backing of the papal legate, Ottobuono, Llywelyn opened negotiations with the king and was eventually recognised as Prince of Wales by King Henry in the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. All of the Welsh princes submitted to Llywelyn II except for Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg. For this recognition he would have to pay the English crown 24,000 marks in installments, this agreement was confirmed by the papacy in Rome. If he wished, Llywelyn could purchase the homage of the one outstanding native prince \u2013 Maredudd ap Rhys of Deheubarth \u2013 for 5,000 marks. However, Llywelyn's territorial ambitions gradually made him unpopular with some minor Welsh leaders, particularly the princes of South Wales.\nThe Treaty of Montgomery marked the high point of Llywelyn's power. Problems began arising soon afterward, initially a dispute with Gilbert de Clare concerning the allegiance of a Welsh nobleman holding lands in Glamorgan. Gilbert built Caerphilly Castle in response to this. King Henry sent a bishop to take possession of the castle while the dispute was resolved but when Gilbert regained the castle by trickery, the king was unable to do anything about it.\nFollowing the death of King Henry in late 1272, with the new King Edward I of England away from the kingdom on a crusade, the rule fell to three men. One of them, Roger Mortimer was one of Llywelyn's rivals in the marches. When Humphrey de Bohun tried to take back Brycheiniog, which was granted to Llywelyn by the Treaty of Montgomery, Mortimer supported de Bohun. Llywelyn was also finding it difficult to raise the annual sums required under the terms of this treaty and ceased making payments.\nIn early 1274, there was a plot by Llywelyn's brother, Dafydd, and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of Powys Wenwynwyn and his son, Owain, to kill Llywelyn. Dafydd was with Llywelyn at the time, and it was arranged that Owain would come with armed men on 2 February to carry out the assassination; however, he was prevented by a snowstorm. Llywelyn did not discover the full details of the plot until Owain confessed to the Bishop of Bangor. He said that the intention had been to make Dafydd prince of Gwynedd and that Dafydd would reward Gruffydd with lands. Dafydd and Gruffydd fled to England where they were maintained by the king and carried out raids on Llywelyn's lands, increasing Llywelyn's resentment. When Edward called Llywelyn to Chester in 1275 to pay homage, Llywelyn refused to attend.\nLlywelyn also made an enemy of King Edward by continuing to ally himself with the family of Simon de Montfort, even though their power was now greatly reduced. Llywelyn sought to marry Eleanor de Montfort, born c. 1258, Simon de Montfort's daughter. They were married by proxy in 1275, but King Edward took exception to the marriage, in part because Eleanor was his first cousin: her mother was Eleanor of England, daughter of King John and princess of the House of Plantagenet. When Eleanor sailed from France to meet Llywelyn, Edward hired men to seize her ship and she was imprisoned at Windsor Castle until Llywelyn made certain concessions.\nTreaty of Aberconwy.\nIn 1276 Edward declared Llywelyn a rebel, and in 1277 he gathered an enormous army to march against him. Edward's intention was to disinherit Llywelyn completely and take over Gwynedd Is Conwy himself. He was considering two options for Gwynedd Uwch Conwy: either to divide it between Llywelyn's brothers, Dafydd and Owain, or to annex Anglesey and divide only the mainland between the two brothers. Edward was supported by Dafydd ap Gruffudd and Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn. Many of the lesser Welsh princes who had supported Llywelyn had hastened to make peace with Edward. By the summer of 1277, Edward's forces had left from Chester to reach the River Conwy and encamped at Deganwy, while another force had captured Anglesey and took possession of the harvest there. This deprived Llywelyn and his men of food, forcing them to seek terms. The attack came from all directions from east of the border, Henry de Lacy attacked from Shrewsbury and Montgomeryshire, Roger Mortimer to Builth and Gwenwynwyn returned to take back Cyfeiliog and other parts of Powys. The lack of provisions forced Llywelyn into hiding, but the Welsh did see minor successes against the English.\nFollowing the battles, the result was the Treaty of Aberconwy, signed by Llywelyn on 9 November 1277. The outcome and peace accord guaranteed the return of lands to Llywelyn, but at a price. He regained Anglesey and parts of Snowdonia as his Kingdom of Gwynedd ruled as the Prince of Wales with the homage of five lords. He would have to pay a fine of 50,000 marks for the incident and would forgo his share of the rent of Anglesey to the crown. Meanwhile, the Ll\u0177n Peninsula was given to his brother Owain who was released from jail in 1254. Then the Perfeddwlad in Gwynedd was given to Dafydd ap Gruffudd, with a promise that if Llywelyn died without an heir he would be given a share of Gwynedd Uwch Conwy instead.\nWith the peace accord in place, Llywelyn went to London and Parliament for the Christmas of 1277 and paid homage to the King of England. Llywelyn met Edward, and his partner Eleanor with the royal family at Worcester, they would marry the next year.\nLlywelyn exacted peace for several years, however, the English continued to pursue an Anglicisation policy in Wales. In the North East of Wales, the four cantrefs of the Court of Chester were brought under power violently. Whilst in the South West in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion) and Carmarthenshire the same policy was enacted by local sheriffs. The rough policy forced the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Peckham to attempt to bring harmony between the Church of England and the Church in Wales. In 1280, Peckham met with Llywelyn to make an agreement on the changes. However, Llywelyn's intentions were distracted and claimed the truce was broken by his fellow kin, Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn. The archbishop reminded Llywelyn that his grievance would not be heard, as Llywelyn's terms of Cyfraith Hywel (Welsh law code) were unreasonable in a contemporary setting. However, Llywelyn reconciled with his brother, Dafydd III, and they listened to the grievances of the cantrefs in Chester and once more secretly plotted a revolt together, this time, the forces of Wales were united against the English.\nMarriage and family.\nLlywelyn agreed with Edward I and was given permission to be married at the door of Worcester Cathedral on 13 October 1278. It was a minor ceremony attended by the Kings of Scotland and England, the Earl of Lancaster. Eleanor was to die in childbirth on 19 June 1282 after she gave birth to a daughter named Gwenllian. A stained glass window exists to this day depicting the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Eleanor. By all accounts, the marriage was a genuine love match; Llywelyn is not known to have fathered any illegitimate children, which is extremely unusual for the Welsh royalty. (In medieval Wales, illegitimate children were as entitled to their father's property as legitimate children.)\nLast campaign and death.\nBy early 1282, many of the lesser princes who had supported Edward against Llywelyn in 1277 were becoming disillusioned with the exactions of the royal officers. On Palm Sunday that year, Dafydd ap Gruffydd attacked the English at Hawarden Castle and then laid siege to Rhuddlan. Meanwhile, the revolt quickly spread to other parts of Wales, with Aberystwyth Castle captured and burnt by Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg (heir of Prince of South Wales/Deheubarth) and rebellion in South Wales, also inspired by Dafydd according to the annals, where Carreg Cennen Castle was captured. Llywelyn, according to a letter he sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury John Peckham, was not involved in the planning of the revolt. He felt obliged, however, to support his brother and a war began for which the Welsh were ill-prepared.\nEvents followed a similar pattern to 1277, with Edward's forces capturing Gwynedd Is Conwy, Anglesey and taking the harvest. The English force occupying Anglesey tried to cross to the mainland on a bridge of boats but failed and was defeated in the Battle of Moel-y-don. The Archbishop of Canterbury tried mediating between Llywelyn and Edward, and Llywelyn was offered a large estate in England if he would surrender Wales to Edward, while Dafydd was to go on crusade and not return without the king's permission. In an emotional reply, which has been compared to the Declaration of Arbroath, Llywelyn said he would not abandon the people whom his ancestors had protected since \"the days of Kamber son of Brutus\" and rejected the offer.\nLlywelyn now left Dafydd to lead the defence of Gwynedd and took a force South, trying to rally support in Mid and South Wales and open up an important second front. On 11 December at the Battle of Orewin Bridge at Builth Wells, he was killed while separated from his army. The exact circumstances are unclear and there are two conflicting accounts of his death. Both accounts agree that Llywelyn was tricked into leaving the bulk of his army and was then attacked and killed. The first account says that Llywelyn and his chief minister approached the forces of Edmund Mortimer and Hugh Le Strange after crossing a bridge. They then heard the sound of battle as the main body of his army was met in battle by the forces of Roger Despenser and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn. Llywelyn turned to rejoin his forces and was pursued by a lone lancer who struck him down. It was not until some time later that an English knight recognised the body as that of the King. This version of events was written in the north of England some fifty years later and has suspicious similarities with details about the Battle of Stirling Bridge in Scotland.\nAn alternative version of events written in the east of England by monks in contact with Llywelyn's exiled daughter, Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn, and niece, Gwladys ferch Dafydd, states that Llywelyn, at the front of his army, approached the combined forces of Edmund and Roger Mortimer, Hugo Le Strange, and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn on the promise that he would receive their homage. This was a deception. His army was immediately engaged in fierce battle during which a significant section of it was routed, causing Llywelyn and his eighteen retainers to become separated. At around dusk, Llywelyn and a small group of his retainers (which included clergy) were ambushed and chased into a wood at Aberedw. Llywelyn was surrounded and struck down. As he lay dying, he asked for a priest and gave away his identity. He was then killed and his head hewn from his body. His person was searched and various items recovered, including a list of \"conspirators\", which may well have been faked, and his privy seal.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the king wishes to have the copy [of the list] found in the breeches of Llywelyn, he can have it from Edmund Mortimer, who has custody of it and also of Llywelyn\u2019s privy seal and certain other things found in the same place.\nThe privy seal of Llywelyn the Last, his wife Eleanor and his brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd are thought to have been melted down by the English after finding them upon their bodies to make a chalice in 1284.\nThere are legends surrounding the fate of Llywelyn's severed head. It is known that it was sent to Edward at Rhuddlan and after being shown to the English troops based in Anglesey, Edward sent the head on to London. In London, it was set up in the city pillory for a day, and crowned with ivy (i.e. to show he was a \"king\" of Outlaws and in mockery of the ancient Welsh prophecy, which said that a Welshman would be crowned in London as king of the whole of Britain). Then it was carried by a horseman on the point of his lance to the Tower of London and set up over the gate. It was still on the Tower of London 15 years later.\nThe last resting place of Llywelyn's body is not known for certain; however, it has always been tradition that it was interred at the Cistercians Abbey at Abbeycwmhir. On 28 December 1282, Archbishop Peckham wrote a letter to the Archdeacon of Brecon at Brecon Priory:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is further supporting evidence for this hypothesis in the Chronicle of Florence of Worcester:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnother theory is that his body was transferred to Llanrumney Hall in Cardiff.\nThe poet Gruffudd ab yr Ynad Coch wrote in an elegy on Llywelyn:\n&lt;poem&gt;Do you not see the path of the wind and the rain?\nDo you not see the oak trees in turmoil?\nCold my heart in a fearful breast\nFor the king, the oaken door of Aberffraw&lt;/poem&gt;\nThere is an enigmatic reference in the Welsh annals Brut y Tywysogion, \"... and then Llywelyn was betrayed in the belfry at Bangor by his own men\". No further explanation is given.\nAnnexation.\nWith the loss of Llywelyn, Welsh morale and the will to resist diminished. Dafydd was Llywelyn's named successor. He carried on the struggle for several months, but in June 1283 was captured in the uplands above Abergwyngregyn at Bera Mountain together with his family. He was brought before Edward, then taken to Shrewsbury where a special session of Parliament condemned him to death. He was dragged through the streets, hanged, drawn and quartered.\nAfter the final defeat of 1283, Gwynedd was stripped of all royal insignia, relics and regalia. Edward Longshanks took particular delight in appropriating the royal home of the Gwynedd dynasty. In August 1284, he set up his court at Abergwyngregyn, Gwynedd. With equal deliberateness, he removed all the insignia of majesty from Gwynedd; a coronet was solemnly presented to the shrine of St. Edward at Westminster; the matrices of the seals of Llywelyn, of his wife, and of his brother Dafydd were melted down to make a chalice which was given by the king to Vale Royal Abbey where it remained until the dissolution of that institution in 1538, after which it came into the possession of the family of the final abbot. The most precious religious relic in Gwynedd, the fragment of the True Cross known as Cross of Neith, was paraded through London in May 1285 in a solemn procession on foot led by the king, the queen, the archbishop of Canterbury and fourteen bishops and the magnates of the realm. Edward was thereby appropriating the historical and religious regalia of the house of Gwynedd and placarding to the world the extinction of its dynasty and the annexation of the principality to his Crown. Commenting on this a contemporary chronicler is said to have declared \"and then all Wales was cast to the ground\".\nMost of Llywelyn's relatives ended their lives in captivity with the notable exceptions of his younger brother Rhodri ap Gruffudd, who had long since sold his claim to the crown and endeavoured to keep a very low profile, and a distant cousin, Madog ap Llywelyn, who in 1294 led a revolt and briefly claimed the title Prince of Wales. Llywelyn and Eleanor's baby daughter Gwenllian of Wales was captured by Edward's troops in 1283. She was interned at Sempringham Priory in England for the rest of her life, becoming a nun in 1317 and dying without issue in 1337, probably knowing little of her heritage and speaking none of her language.\nDafydd's two surviving sons were captured and incarcerated at Bristol Gaol, where they eventually died many years later. Llywelyn's elder brother Owain Goch ap Gruffudd disappears from the record in 1282. Llywelyn's surviving brother Rhodri ap Gruffudd (who had been exiled from Wales since 1272) survived and held manors in Gloucestershire, Cheshire, Surrey, and Powys and died around 1315. His grandson, Owain Lawgoch, later claimed the title Prince of Wales.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "47628", "revid": "24198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47628", "title": "Bomb", "text": "Explosive weapon that uses exothermic reaction\nA bomb is an explosive weapon that uses the exothermic reaction of an explosive material to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of energy. Detonations inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical stress, the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles, pressure damage, and explosion-generated effects. Bombs have been utilized since the 11th century starting in East Asia.\nThe term \"bomb\" is not usually applied to explosive devices used for civilian purposes such as construction or mining, although the people using the devices may sometimes refer to them as a \"bomb\". The military use of the term \"bomb\", or more specifically aerial bomb action, typically refers to airdropped, unpowered explosive weapons most commonly used by air forces and naval aviation. Other military explosive weapons not classified as \"bombs\" include shells, depth charges (used in water), or land mines. In unconventional warfare, other names can refer to a range of offensive weaponry. For instance, in recent asymmetric conflicts, homemade bombs called \"improvised explosive devices\" (IEDs) have been employed by irregular forces to great effectiveness.\nThe word comes from the Latin , which in turn comes from the Greek romanized , an onomatopoetic term meaning 'booming', 'buzzing'.\nHistory.\nGunpowder bombs had been mentioned since the 11th century. In 1000 AD, a soldier by the name of Tang Fu (\u5510\u798f) demonstrated a design of gunpowder pots (a proto-bomb which spews fire) and gunpowder caltrops, for which he was richly rewarded. In the same year, Xu Dong wrote that trebuchets used bombs that were like \"flying fire\", suggesting that they were incendiaries. In the military text \"Wujing Zongyao\" of 1044, bombs such as the \"ten-thousand fire flying sand magic bomb\", \"burning heaven fierce fire unstoppable bomb\", and \"thunderclap bomb\" (\"pilipao\") were mentioned. However these were soft-shell bombs and did not use metal casings.\nBombs made of cast iron shells packed with explosive gunpowder date to 13th century China. Explosive bombs were used in East Asia in 1221, by a Jurchen Jin army against a Chinese Song city. The term for this explosive bomb seems to have been coined the \"thunder crash bomb\" during a Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234) naval battle in 1231 against the Mongols.\nThe \"History of Jin\" (\u91d1\u53f2) (compiled by 1345) states that in 1232, as the Mongol general Subutai (1176\u20131248) descended on the Jin stronghold of Kaifeng, the defenders had a \"thunder crash bomb\" which \"consisted of gunpowder put into an iron container\u00a0... then when the fuse was lit (and the projectile shot off) there was a great explosion the noise whereof was like thunder, audible for more than thirty miles, and the vegetation was scorched and blasted by the heat over an area of more than half a \"mou\". When hit, even iron armour was quite pierced through.\"\nThe Song Dynasty (960\u20131279) official Li Zengbo wrote in 1257 that arsenals should have several hundred thousand iron bomb shells available and that when he was in Jingzhou, about one to two thousand were produced each month for dispatch of ten to twenty thousand at a time to Xiangyang and Yingzhou. The Ming Dynasty text \"Huolongjing\" describes the use of poisonous gunpowder bombs, including the \"wind-and-dust\" bomb.\nDuring the Mongol invasions of Japan, the Mongols used the explosive \"thunder-crash bombs\" against the Japanese. Archaeological evidence of the \"thunder-crash bombs\" has been discovered in an underwater shipwreck off the shore of Japan by the Kyushu Okinawa Society for Underwater Archaeology. X-rays by Japanese scientists of the excavated shells confirmed that they contained gunpowder.\nShock.\nExplosive shock waves can cause situations such as body displacement (i.e., people being thrown through the air), dismemberment, internal bleeding and ruptured eardrums.\nShock waves produced by explosive events have two distinct components, the positive and negative wave. The positive wave shoves outward from the point of detonation, followed by the trailing vacuum space \"sucking back\" towards the point of origin as the shock bubble collapses. The greatest defense against shock injuries is distance from the source of shock. As a point of reference, the overpressure at the Oklahoma City bombing was estimated in the range of 28 MPa.\nHeat.\nA thermal wave is created by the sudden release of heat caused by an explosion. Military bomb tests have documented temperatures of up to 2,480\u00a0\u00b0C (4,500\u00a0\u00b0F). While capable of inflicting severe to catastrophic burns and causing secondary fires, thermal wave effects are considered very limited in range compared to shock and fragmentation. This rule has been challenged, however, by military development of thermobaric weapons, which employ a combination of negative shock wave effects and extreme temperature to incinerate objects within the blast radius.\nFragmentation.\nFragmentation is produced by the acceleration of shattered pieces of bomb casing and adjacent physical objects. The use of fragmentation in bombs dates to the 14th century, and appears in the Ming Dynasty text \"Huolongjing\". The fragmentation bombs were filled with iron pellets and pieces of broken porcelain. Once the bomb explodes, the resulting fragments are capable of piercing the skin and blinding enemy soldiers.\nWhile conventionally viewed as small metal shards moving at super-supersonic and hypersonic speeds, fragmentation can occur in epic proportions and travel for extensive distances. When the SS \"Grandcamp\" exploded in the Texas City Disaster on April 16, 1947, one fragment of that blast was a two-ton anchor which was hurled nearly two miles inland to embed itself in the parking lot of the Pan American refinery.\nEffects on living things.\nTo people who are close to a blast incident, such as bomb disposal technicians, soldiers wearing body armor, deminers, or individuals wearing little to no protection, there are four types of blast effects on the human body: overpressure (shock), fragmentation, impact, and heat. Overpressure refers to the sudden and drastic rise in ambient pressure that can damage the internal organs, possibly leading to permanent damage or death. Fragmentation can also include sand, debris and vegetation from the area surrounding the blast source. This is very common in anti-personnel mine blasts. The projection of materials poses a potentially lethal threat caused by cuts in soft tissues, as well as infections, and injuries to the internal organs. When the overpressure wave impacts the body it can induce violent levels of blast-induced acceleration. Resulting injuries may range from minor to unsurvivable. Immediately following this initial acceleration, deceleration injuries can occur when a person impacts directly against a rigid surface or obstacle after being set in motion by the force of the blast. Finally, injury and fatality can result from the explosive fireball as well as incendiary agents projected onto the body. Personal protective equipment, such as a bomb suit or demining ensemble, as well as helmets, visors and foot protection, can dramatically reduce the four effects, depending upon the charge, proximity and other variables.\nTypes.\nExperts commonly distinguish between civilian and military bombs. The latter are almost always mass-produced weapons, developed and constructed to a standard design out of standard components and intended to be deployed in a standard explosive device. IEDs are divided into three basic categories by basic size and delivery. Type 76, IEDs are hand-carried parcel or suitcase bombs, type 80, are \"suicide vests\" worn by a bomber, and type 3 devices are vehicles laden with explosives to act as large-scale stationary or self-propelled bombs, also known as VBIED (vehicle-borne IEDs).\nImprovised explosive materials are typically unstable and subject to spontaneous, unintentional detonation triggered by a wide range of environmental effects, ranging from impact and friction to electrostatic shock. Even subtle motion, change in temperature, or the nearby use of cellphones or radios can trigger an unstable or remote-controlled device. Any interaction with explosive materials or devices by unqualified personnel should be considered a grave and immediate risk of death or dire injury. The safest response to finding an object believed to be an explosive device is to get as far away from it as possible.\nAtomic bombs are based on the theory of nuclear fission, that when a large atom splits, it releases a massive amount of energy. Thermonuclear weapons, (colloquially known as \"hydrogen bombs\") use the energy from an initial fission explosion to create an even more powerful fusion explosion.\nThe term \"dirty bomb\" refers to a specialized device that relies on a comparatively low explosive yield to scatter harmful material over a wide area. Most commonly associated with radiological or chemical materials, dirty bombs seek to kill or injure and then to deny access to a contaminated area until a thorough clean-up can be accomplished. In the case of urban settings, this clean-up may take extensive time, rendering the contaminated zone virtually uninhabitable in the interim.\nThe power of large bombs is typically measured in kilotons (kt) or megatons of TNT (Mt). The most powerful bombs ever used in combat were the two atomic bombs dropped by the United States to attack Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the most powerful ever tested was the Tsar Bomba. The most powerful non-nuclear bomb is Russian \"Father of All Bombs\" (officially Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power (ATBIP)) followed by the United States Air Force's MOAB (officially Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or more commonly known as the \"Mother of All Bombs\").\nBelow is a list of five different types of bombs based on the fundamental explosive mechanism they employ.\nCompressed gas.\nRelatively small explosions can be produced by pressurizing a container until catastrophic failure such as with a dry ice bomb. Technically, devices that create explosions of this type can not be classified as \"bombs\" by the definition presented at the top of this article. However, the explosions created by these devices can cause property damage, injury, or death. Flammable liquids, gasses and gas mixtures dispersed in these explosions may also ignite if exposed to a spark or flame.\nLow explosive.\nThe simplest and oldest bombs store energy in the form of a low explosive. Black powder is an example of a low explosive. Low explosives typically consist of a mixture of an oxidizing salt, such as potassium nitrate (saltpeter), with solid fuel, such as charcoal or aluminium powder. These compositions deflagrate upon ignition, producing hot gas. Under normal circumstances, this deflagration occurs too slowly to produce a significant pressure wave; low explosives, therefore, must generally be used in large quantities or confined in a container with a high burst pressure to be useful as a bomb.\nHigh explosive.\nA high explosive bomb is one that employs a process called \"detonation\" to rapidly go from an initially high energy molecule to a very low energy molecule. Detonation is distinct from deflagration in that the chemical reaction propagates faster than the speed of sound (often many times faster) in an intense shock wave. Therefore, the pressure wave produced by a high explosive is not significantly increased by confinement as detonation occurs so quickly that the resulting plasma does not expand much before all the explosive material has reacted. This has led to the development of plastic explosive. A casing is still employed in some high explosive bombs, but with the purpose of fragmentation. Most high explosive bombs consist of an insensitive secondary explosive that must be detonated with a blasting cap containing a more sensitive primary explosive.\nThermobaric.\nA thermobaric bomb is a type of explosive that utilizes oxygen from the surrounding air to generate an intense, high-temperature explosion, and in practice the blast wave typically produced by such a weapon is of a significantly longer duration than that produced by a conventional condensed explosive. The fuel-air bomb is one of the best-known types of thermobaric weapons.\nNuclear fission.\nNuclear fission type atomic bombs utilize the energy present in very heavy atomic nuclei, such as U-235 or Pu-239. In order to release this energy rapidly, a certain amount of the fissile material must be very rapidly consolidated while being exposed to a neutron source. If consolidation occurs slowly, repulsive forces drive the material apart before a significant explosion can occur. Under the right circumstances, rapid consolidation can provoke a chain reaction that can proliferate and intensify by many orders of magnitude within microseconds. The energy released by a nuclear fission bomb may be tens of thousands of times greater than a chemical bomb of the same mass.\nNuclear fusion.\nA thermonuclear weapon is a type of nuclear bomb that releases energy through the combination of fission and fusion of the light atomic nuclei of deuterium and tritium. With this type of bomb, a thermonuclear detonation is triggered by the detonation of a fission type nuclear bomb contained within a material containing high concentrations of deuterium and tritium. Weapon yield is typically increased with a tamper that increases the duration and intensity of the reaction through inertial confinement and neutron reflection. Nuclear fusion bombs can have arbitrarily high yields making them hundreds or thousands of times more powerful than nuclear fission.\nA pure fusion weapon is a hypothetical nuclear weapon that does not require a primary fission stage to start a fusion reaction.\nAntimatter.\nAntimatter bombs can theoretically be constructed, but antimatter is very costly to produce and hard to store safely.\nDelivery.\nThe first air-dropped bombs were used by the Austrians in the 1849 siege of Venice. Two hundred unmanned balloons carried small bombs, although few bombs actually hit the city.\nThe first bombing from a fixed-wing aircraft took place in 1911 when the Italians dropped bombs by hand on the Turkish lines in what is now Libya, during the Italo-Turkish War. The first large scale dropping of bombs took place during World War I starting in 1915 with the German Zeppelin airship raids on London, England, and the same war saw the invention of the first heavy bombers. One Zeppelin raid on 8 September 1915 dropped of high explosives and incendiary bombs, including one bomb that weighed .\nDuring World War II bombing became a major military feature, and a number of novel delivery methods were introduced. These included Barnes Wallis's bouncing bomb, designed to bounce across water, avoiding torpedo nets and other underwater defenses, until it reached a dam, ship, or other destination, where it would sink and explode. By the end of the war, planes such as the allied forces' Avro Lancaster were delivering with accuracy from , ten ton earthquake bombs (also invented by Barnes Wallis) named \"Grand Slam\", which, unusually for the time, were delivered from high altitude in order to gain high speed, and would, upon impact, penetrate and explode deep underground (\"camouflet\"), causing massive caverns or craters, and affecting targets too large or difficult to be affected by other types of bomb.\nModern military bomber aircraft are designed around a large-capacity internal bomb bay, while fighter-bombers usually carry bombs externally on pylons or bomb racks or on multiple ejection racks, which enable mounting several bombs on a single pylon. Some bombs are equipped with a parachute, such as the World War II \"parafrag\" (an fragmentation bomb), the Vietnam War-era daisy cutters, and the bomblets of some modern cluster bombs. Parachutes slow the bomb's descent, giving the dropping aircraft time to get to a safe distance from the explosion. This is especially important with air-burst nuclear weapons (especially those dropped from slower aircraft or with very high yields), and in situations where the aircraft releases a bomb at low altitude. A number of modern bombs are also precision-guided munitions, and may be guided after they leave an aircraft by remote control, or by autonomous guidance.\nAircraft may also deliver bombs in the form of warheads on guided missiles, such as long-range cruise missiles, which can also be launched from warships.\nA hand grenade is delivered by being thrown. Grenades can also be projected by other means, such as being launched from the muzzle of a rifle (as in the rifle grenade), using a grenade launcher (such as the M203), or by attaching a rocket to the explosive grenade (as in a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG)).\nA bomb may also be positioned in advance and concealed.\nA bomb destroying a rail track just before a train arrives will usually cause the train to derail. In addition to the damage to vehicles and people, a bomb exploding in a transport network often damages, and is sometimes mainly intended to damage, the network itself. This applies to railways, bridges, runways, and ports, and, to a lesser extent (depending on circumstances), to roads.\nIn the case of suicide bombing, the bomb is often carried by the attacker on their body, or in a vehicle driven to the target.\nThe Blue Peacock nuclear mines, which were also termed \"bombs\", were planned to be positioned during wartime and be constructed such that, if disturbed, they would explode within ten seconds.\nThe explosion of a bomb may be triggered by a detonator or a fuse. Detonators are triggered by clocks, remote controls like cell phones or some kind of sensor, such as pressure (altitude), radar, vibration or contact. Detonators vary in ways they work, they can be electrical, fire fuze or blast initiated detonators and others,\nBlast seat.\nIn forensic science, the point of detonation of a bomb is referred to as its blast seat, seat of explosion, blast hole or epicenter. Depending on the type, quantity and placement of explosives, the blast seat may be either spread out or concentrated (i.e., an explosion crater).\nOther types of explosions, such as dust or vapor explosions, do not cause craters or even have definitive blast seats.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is known historically to have been situated along the Silk Road, on the northern coast of the Caspian Sea, in the Volga Delta region of what is now southern Russia. Its precise location has long been unknown.\nIn 2008, a Russian archaeologist claimed to have discovered the remains of Atil in Samosdelka, a village in the Volga Delta approximately 30\u00a0km southwest of the city of Astrakhan. This claim has since been disproven.\nName.\nThe historical Turkic peoples living on or near the Volga region called both the river and the Khazar capital city on the river or \"Atil\".\nModern Turkic languages have retained the historical name for the Volga. The Volga is known as \" \u0130del \"( \u0418\u0434\u0435\u043b) in Tatar, as \" At\u0103l \" (\u0410\u0442\u04d1\u043b) in Chuvash, as \" I\u017aelin \" in Bashkir, as \" Ed\u0131l \" in Kazakh, and as \" \u0130dil \" in Turkish. The origin and meaning of the ancient Turkic form \"/\" are uncertain.\nHistory and description.\nAtil was located along the Volga delta at the northwestern corner of the Caspian Sea. Following the defeat of the Khazars in the Second Arab-Khazar War, Atil became the capital of Khazaria.\nIbn Khordadbeh, writing in c.\u2009870, names \"Khamlij\" as the capital of the Khazars. This is presumably a rendition of Turkic \"khaganbaligh\" \"city of the khan\" and refers to the city later (in the 10th century) named as \"Atil\" in Arab historiography.\nAt its height, the city was a major center of trade. It consisted of three parts separated by the Volga. The western part contained the administrative center of the city, with a court house and a large military garrison. The eastern part of the city was built later and acted as the commercial center of Atil, and had many public baths and shops. Between them was an island on which stood the palaces of the Khazar Khagan and Bek. The island was connected to one of the other parts of the city by a pontoon bridge. \nAccording to Arab sources of the 10th century, one half of the city was referred to as Atil, while the other was named Khazaran.\nAtil was a multi-ethnic and religiously diverse city, inhabited by Jews, Christians, Muslims, Shamanists, and Pagans, many of them traders from foreign countries. All of the religious groups had their own places of worship in the city, and there were seven judges appointed to settle disputes (two Christian, two Jewish, and two Muslim judges, with a single judge for all of the Shamanists and other Pagans). The numerous Christians of Atil were under the jurisdiction of their own bishop; the minaret of the Friday mosque of the Muslims of Atil is said to have been higher than the castle.\nThe city was a major trade center, and managed the Khazar slave trade, in which slaves bought for export were transported from the Khazar Khaganate to either the Black Sea slave trade in the West via the Black Sea port of Kerch, or East from the capital of Atil via the Caspian Sea to Central Asia and from there to slavery in the Abbasid Caliphate.\nSvyatoslav I of Kiev sacked Atil in 968 or 969 CE. Ibn Hawqal and al-Muqaddasi refer to Atil after 969, indicating that it may have been rebuilt. Al-Biruni (mid-11th century) reported that Atil was again in ruins, and did not mention the later city of Saqsin which was built nearby, so it is possible that this new Atil was only destroyed in the middle of the 11th century.\nThe search for archaeological remains.\nAs of 2024, the archaeological remains of Atil have not been positively identified. An accepted hypothesis is that they were washed away by the rising level of the Caspian Sea.\nSamosdelka site.\nIn September 2008, Russian archaeologists excavating in the Volga Delta fishing village of Samosdelka announced their discovery of what they claimed were the remains of Atil. A 2020 assessment by the Russian Geographic Society concluded that Atil had not been found in Samosdelka, and announced that new excavations were underway at another site.\nSemibugry site.\nThe archaeological remains of a settlement from the Khazar period near the village of Semibugry (Russian: \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0433\u0440\u044b) in the central part of the Volga Delta were discovered after Samosdelka and as of 2020 were being excavated in the hopes that the settlement was Atil. According to historian Alex Feldman, \"it remains impossible to archaeologically prove\" the location of Atil.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine.\nThe dish takes its name from the wide, shallow traditional pan used to cook the dish on an open fire, \"paella\" being the word for a frying pan in Valencian/Catalan language. As a dish, it may have ancient roots, but in its modern form, it is traced back to the mid-19th century, in the rural area around the Albufera lagoon adjacent to the city of Valencia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.\nPaella valenciana is the traditional paella of the Valencia region, believed to be the original recipe, and consists of Valencian rice, olive oil, rabbit, chicken, duck, snails, saffron or a substitute, tomato, ferradura or flat green bean, lima beans, salt and water. The dish is sometimes seasoned with whole rosemary branches. Traditionally, the yellow color comes from saffron, but turmeric, paprika, \"Calendula\" or artificial colorants can be used as substitutes. Artichoke hearts and stems may be used as seasonal ingredients. Most paella cooks use bomba rice, but a cultivar known as \"senia\" is also used in the Valencia region.\nPaella de marisco (seafood \"paella\") replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables, while paella mixta (mixed \"paella\") combines meat from livestock, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans, with the traditional rice.\nOther popular local variations of \"paella\" are cooked throughout the Mediterranean area, the rest of Spain, and internationally. In Spain, \"paella\" is traditionally included in restaurant menus on Thursdays.\nHistory.\nPossible origins.\nMuslims in Al-Andalus began rice cultivation around the 10th century. Eastern Iberian Peninsula locals often made casseroles of rice, fish, and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts, thus establishing the custom of eating rice in Spain. This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th century. Afterward, it became customary for cooks to combine rice with vegetables, beans, and dry cod, providing an acceptable meal for Lent. Along Spain's Mediterranean coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.\nSpanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish \"symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries: rice.\"\nNaming, etymology and \"paellera\".\n\"Paella\" is a Valencian word that means frying pan, from which the dish gets its name. Valencian speakers use the word \"paella\" for all pans, including the traditional shallow pan used for cooking the homonym dish. The pan is made of polished or coated steel with two side handles.\"\"\nIn many regions of Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries, the term \"paellera\" may be used for the traditional pan, while \"paella\" is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it. Both \"paella\" and \"paellera\" are correct terms for the pan.\nAccording to the etymologist Joan Coromines, the Catalan word \"paella\" derives from the Old French word \"paelle\" for frying pan, which in turn comes from the Latin word \"patella\" for pan; he thinks that otherwise the word should be \"padella\", as inter-vowel -d- dropping is not typical of Old Catalan.\nThe word \"paella\" is also related to \"paila\" used in many Latin American countries. \"Paila\" in Latin American Spanish refers to a variety of cookware resembling metal and clay pans, which are also used for both cooking and serving.\nThe Latin root \"patella\" from which \"paella\" derives is also akin to the modern French \"po\u00eale\", the Italian \"padella\", and the Old Spanish \"padilla\".\nSome claim that the word \"paella\" comes from the Arabic , pronounced \"baqiyya\", meaning \"leftovers.\" This claim is based on the 8th-century custom in which Moorish kings' servants would take home the rice, chicken, and vegetables their employers left at the end of the meal. It has been said, however, that a problem with this etymology is that the word \"paella\" is not attested until six centuries after Moorish Valencia was conquered by James I.\n\"Paella valenciana\".\nOriginally, paella made in Valencia was a lunchtime meal for farmers and farm laborers. Workers would gather what was available to them around the rice fields. This often included tomatoes, onions, and snails. Rabbit or duck was a common addition, or chicken less often.\nOn special occasions, 18th-century Valencians used \"calderos\" to cook the rice in the open air of their orchards near lake Albufera. Water vole meat was one of the main ingredients of early paellas, along with eel and butter beans. Novelist Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez described the Valencia custom of eating water voles in \"Ca\u00f1as y Barro\" (1902), a realistic novel about life among the fishermen and peasants near lake Albufera.\nLiving standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th century in Spain, giving rise to gatherings and outings in the countryside. This led to a change in paella's ingredients, as well, using instead rabbit, chicken, duck, and sometimes snails. The dish became so popular that in 1840, a local Spanish newspaper first used the word \"paella\" to refer to the recipe rather than the pan, according to food historian Lynne Olver.\nThe most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was: short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), butter beans, great northern beans, runner beans, artichoke (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), tomatoes, fresh rosemary, sweet paprika, saffron, garlic (optional), salt, olive oil, and water. Poorer Valencians sometimes used only snails for meat. Many Valencians insist that no more than these ingredients should go into making modern \"paella valenciana\", and, in particular, that fish and shellfish are \"absolutely out of the question.\" Another important rule, according to Valencians, is that fresh rosemary should not be added to \"paella valenciana\" made with rosemary-eating snails.\nSeafood and mixed \"paella\".\nOn the Mediterranean coast, Valencian fishermen used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. Later, Spaniards living outside of Valencia combined seafood with meat from land animals, and mixed \"paella\" was born. This \"paella\" is sometimes called \"preparaci\u00f3n barroca\" (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.\nDuring the 20th century, paella's popularity spread past Spain's borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably acquired regional influences. Consequently, \"paella\" recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat, sausage (including chorizo), vegetables and many different seasonings.\nThroughout non-Valencia Spain, some restaurants providing this mixed version refer to it as \"Paella valenciana\". However, Valencians insist that only the original two Valencia recipes are authentic.\nOther Valencian recipes with similar preparations are \"arr\u00f2s a banda\" and \"arr\u00f2s del senyoret\".\nBasic cooking methods.\nAccording to tradition in Valencia, \"paella\" is cooked over an open fire, fueled by orange tree and pine branches and pine cones. This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the \"paella\". Also, dining guests traditionally eat directly out of the pan instead of serving in plates.\nSome recipes call for \"paella\" to be covered and left to settle for five to ten minutes after cooking.\nAfter cooking \"paella\", a layer of scorched rice may be at the bottom of the pan, called \"socarrat\" in Valenci\u00e0. The layer develops on its own if the \"paella\" is cooked over a burner or open fire. This is traditionally considered positive (as long as it is not burnt), and Valencia natives enjoy eating it.\nVariants.\nPhilippines.\n\"Arroz a la valenciana\" (Spanish) or \"Arroz \u00e0 valenciana\" (Portuguese) is considered a part of Philippine cuisine and is regarded as the Philippine version of paella.\nThe Philippine version uses glutinous rice; otherwise, the ingredients are the same. In the Philippines, \"arroz a la valenciana\" refers to chicken, and \"longganisa\" (\"chorizo\") versions.\nIn popular culture.\nCompetitions and records.\nIt has become a custom at mass gatherings in the Valencia region (festivals, political campaigns, protests, etc.) to prepare enormous paellas, sometimes to win a place in the \"Guinness World Records\" book. Chefs use gargantuan \"paelleras\" for these events.\nValencia restaurateur Juan Galbis claims to have made the world's largest \"paella\" with help from a team of workers on 2 October 2001. This \"paella\" fed about 110,000 people, according to Galbis' former website. Galbis says this \"paella\" was even larger than his earlier world-record \"paella\" made on 8 March 1992, which fed about 100,000 people. Galbis' record-breaking 1992 \"paella\" is listed in \"Guinness World Records\".\nAlternative ingredients.\nSome non-Spanish chefs include chorizo in their paellas and other ingredients, which Valencians believe do not belong in \"paella\" of any type. The alternative name proposed for these dishes, although pejorative, is ('rice with things'). Famous cases are Jamie Oliver's \"paella\" recipe (which included chorizo) and Gordon Ramsay's. The author Josep Pla once noted: \"The abuses committed in the name of Paella Valenciana are excessive \u2013 an absolute scandal.\"\nHowever, in an article for \"El Pa\u00eds\", Spanish food writer Ana Vega 'Biscayenne', citing historical references, showed that traditional Valencian paella did indeed include chorizo, exclaiming, \"Ah Jamie, we'll have to invite you to the Falles.\"\nEmoji.\nIn 2015, an emoji for \"paella\" was proposed to Unicode. The emoji was approved for Unicode 9.0 as in June 2016. Apple Inc.'s version of the emoji originally depicted paella de marisco, but was later changed to a more traditional appearance with chicken after online controversy.\nRelated dishes.\nTraditional Valencian cuisine offers recipes similar to \"paella valenciana\" and \"paella de marisco\" such as \"arr\u00f2s negre\", \"arr\u00f2s al forn\", \"arr\u00f2s a banda\" and \"arr\u00f2s amb fesols i naps\" since rice is the base of much of the local cuisine.\nFideu\u00e0 is a Valencian pasta noodle dish variation cooked similarly in a \"paella\". It may be served with allioli sauce.\nOther related dishes:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The five main days celebrated are from 15 to 19 March, while the Masclet\u00e0, a pyrotechnic spectacle of firecracker detonation, takes place every day from 1 to 19 March. The term \"Fallas\" refers to both the celebration and the Falla monuments (\"Falla\", singular; \"Fallas\"/, plural) burnt during the celebration. The Fallas (\"Falles\" in Valencian) festival was added to UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage of humanity list on 30 November 2016. A number of towns in the Valencian Community have similar celebrations inspired by the original Fallas de Valencia festival. For example, the Bonfires of Saint John (\"Hogueras de San Juan\" or \"Fogueres de Sant Joan\") in Alicante or the Fiestas de la Magdalena in Castell\u00f3n de la Plana.\nEach neighbourhood of the city has an organised group of people, the Commission, that meets at the \"Casal faller\", and works all year long holding fundraising parties and dinners, usually featuring the noted dish paella, a specialty of the region. Each \"commission\" produces a construction known as \"falla\" which is burned the last day of the celebration. Currently there are approximately 400 registered commissions in Valencia.\nEtymology.\nThe name of the festival is the plural of the Valencian word \"falla\". The word's derivation is as follows:\nLatin \"fax\" (accusative \"facem\"), \"torch\" \u2192 Latin \"facula\" (diminutive; accusative \"faculam\") \u2192 Vulgar Latin *\"faclam\" \u2192 Valencian \"falla\".\n\"Falles\" and \"ninots\".\nFormerly, much time would be spent by the \"casal faller\" preparing the \"ninots\" (Valencian name for puppets or dolls). During the four days leading up to 19 March, each group takes its \"ninot\" out for a grand parade, and then mounts it, each on its own elaborate firecracker-filled cardboard and paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 artistic monument, in a street of the given neighbourhood. This whole assembly is a \"falla\".\nThe \"ninots\" and their \"falles\" are constructed according to an agreed-upon theme that has traditionally been a satirical jab at whatever draws the attention of the \"fallers\" (the registered participants of the \"casals\"). In modern times, the two-week-long festival has spawned a substantial local industry, to the point that an entire suburban area has been designated the \"Ciutat fallera\" (Falles City). Here, crews of artists and artisans, sculptors, painters, and other craftsmen, all spend months producing elaborate constructions of paper and wax, wood and polystyrene foam tableaux towering up to five stories, composed of fanciful figures, often caricatures, in provocative poses arranged in a gravity-defying manner. Each of them is produced under the direction of one of the many individual neighbourhood \"casals fallers\" who vie with each other to attract the best artists, and then to create the most outrageous allegorical monument to their target. There are about 750 of these neighbourhood associations in Valencia, with over 200,000 members, or a quarter of the city's population.\nDuring Fallas, many people wear their \"casal faller\" dress of regional and historical costumes from different eras of Val\u00e8ncia's history. The \"dol\u00e7aina\" (an oboe-like reed instrument) and \"tabalet\" (a kind of Valencian drum) are frequently heard, as most of the different casals fallers have their own traditional bands.\nAlthough the \"Falles\" is a very traditional event and many participants dress in medieval clothing, the \"ninots\" for 2005 included such modern characters as Shrek and George W. Bush, and the 2012 \"Falles\" included characters like Barack Obama and Lady Gaga. A literary contest organised annually since 1903 by the Lo Rat Penat cultural association recognises the work of local poets who write satirical verses in Valencian that explain these characters. The faller verses are collected in booklets (\"llibrets\") and distributed to participants.\nEvents during \"Fallas\".\nThe five days and nights of \"Fallas\" might be described as a continuous street party. There are a multitude of processions: historical, religious, and comedic. Crowds in the restaurants spill out into the streets. Explosions can be heard all day long and sporadically through the night. Everyone from small children to elderly people can be seen throwing fireworks and noisemakers in the streets, which are littered with pyrotechnical debris. The timing of the events is fixed, and they fall on the same date every year, though there has been discussion about holding some events on the weekend preceding the Fallas, to take greater advantage of the tourist potential of the festival or changing the end date in years where it is due to occur in midweek.\nBut outside the Fallas proper, the Fallas season within the Valencian Community begins on the final Sunday of February and lasts till 19 March, St. Joseph's Day.\nOpening Night (La Crida).\nHeld on the last Sunday of February, \"La Crida\" is held in the evening at the Torres de Serranos, one of the historical gateways to the city. Preceded by a fireworks display and a \"son et lumierie\" show, the city's mayor presents the keys to the Fallera Major and her princess, and after their addresses formally declaring the commencement of the festivities, the Himne de l'Exposici\u00f3 and Marcha Real are played by the city band to mark the formal start of the festivity season.\nLa Despert\u00e0.\nEach day of Falles begins at 8:00 am with \"La Despert\u00e0\" (\"the wake-up call\"). Brass bands appear from the casals and begin to march down every street playing lively music. Close behind them are the \"fallers\", throwing large firecrackers in the street as they go.\nLa Masclet\u00e0.\nThe \"Masclet\u00e0\", an explosive barrage of coordinated firecracker and fireworks displays, takes place at 2:00\u00a0pm from March 1 to 19 (including the festival proper); the main event is the municipal Masclet\u00e0 in the \"Pla\u00e7a de l'Ajuntament\" where the pyrotechnicians compete for the honour of providing the final Masclet\u00e0 of the \"festes\" (on 19 March). At 2:00 pm the clock chimes and the Fallera Major, dressed in her \"fallera\" finery, will call from the balcony of City Hall, \"Senyor/a pirot\u00e8cnic/a, pot comen\u00e7ar la masclet\u00e0!\" (\"Mr./Ms. Pyrotechnic, the Masclet\u00e0 may commence!\"), and the Masclet\u00e0 begins.\nThe Masclet\u00e0 is almost unique to the Valencian Community, and very popular with the Valencian people. Smaller neighbourhoods often hold their own masclet\u00e0 for saints' days, weddings and other celebrations.\nA nighttime variant runs in the evening hours by the same pyrotechnicans that were present in the afternoon. In some days, women pyrotechnicians are selected to compete. The event is televised regionwide.\nLa Plant\u00e0.\nOn the day of the 15th, all of the \"falles infantils\" are to be finished being constructed, and later that night all of the \"falles majors\" (big Falles) are to be completed. If not, they face disqualification.\nOnce the City \"Falles Major\" is finally done a fireworks display -\"Amb de las Falles\" - is held at City Hall Square to pay tribute to everyone who made these works possible.\nL'Ofrena de flors.\nIn this event, the flower offering, each of the casals fallers takes an offering of flowers to the Virgin Mary, titled as \"Our Lady of the Forsaken\", principal patroness of the city of Valencia and the wider Community. This occurs all day during 17\u201318 March, the first day attended by the Fallera Major and her court. A statue of the Virgin Mary and its large pedestal are then covered with all the flowers.\nEls Castells and La Nit del Foc.\nOn the nights of the 15, 16, 17, and 18th there are firework displays in the old riverbed in Val\u00e8ncia. Each night is progressively grander and the last is called \"La Nit del Foc\" (the Night of Fire).\nCavalcada del Foc.\nOn the final evening of Falles, at 7:00 pm on 19 March, a parade known in Valencian as the \"Cavalcada del Foc\" (the Fire Parade) takes place along Col\u00f3n street and Porta de la Mar square. This spectacular celebration of fire, the symbol of the fiesta's spirit, is the \"grand finale\" of Fallas and a colourful, noisy event featuring exhibitions of the varied rites and displays from around the world which use fire; it incorporates floats, giant mechanisms, people in costumes, rockets, gunpowder, street performances and music.\nLa Crem\u00e0.\nOn the final night of Falles, around midnight on 19 March, these \"falles\" are burnt as huge bonfires. This is known as \"La Crem\u00e0\" (the Burning), the climax of the whole event, and the reason why the constructions are called \"falles\" (\"torches\"). Traditionally, the falla in the \"Pla\u00e7a de l'Ajuntament\" is burned last.\nAll \"commissions\" have a \"falla infantil\" (children's \"falles\", smaller and without satirical themes), which are held a few meters away from the main one. This is burnt first, at 10:00 pm. The main neighbourhood \"falles\" are burnt closer to midnight; the burning of the \"falles\" in the city centre often starts later. For example, in 2005, the fire brigade delayed the burning of the Egyptian funeral \"falla\" in \"Carrer del Convent de Jerusalem\" until 1:30 am, when they were sure all safety concerns were addressed.\nEach \"falla\" is laden with fireworks which are lit first. The construction itself is lit either after or during the explosion of these fireworks. \"Falles\" burn quite quickly, and the heat given off is felt by all around. The heat from the larger ones often drives the crowd back a couple of metres, even though they are already behind barriers that the fire brigade has set several meters from the construction. In narrower streets, the heat scorches the surrounding buildings, and the firemen douse their fronts, window blinds, street signs, etc. with water hoses to stop them catching fire or melting, from the beginning of the \"crem\u00e0\" until it cools down.\nAway from the \"falles\", people frolic in the streets, the whole city resembling an open-air dance party, except that instead of music there is the incessant (and occasionally deafening) sound of people throwing fireworks around randomly. There are many stalls selling trinkets and snacks such as the typical fried \"porres\", \"churros\" and \"bunyols\", as well as roasted chestnuts.\nWhile the smaller fallas dotted around the streets are burned at approximately the same time, the last falla to be burned is the main one, which is saved until last so that everybody can watch it. This main falla is found outside the \"Ajuntament\" \u2013 the city hall building. People arrive a few hours before the scheduled burning time to get a front row view. This final falla is burned in public after the signal from the Fallera Major to officially commence.\nTraditional dress.\nThe traditional dress worn by \"fallers\" (males) has changed from black trousers and black jacket with white shirt and other motives, to colorful and a more traditional and historic custom with many decorations. These dresses can be very expensive but not as much as the dresses of the \"reines falleras\" (queens of the festival) and the Royal Court. Prices of female traditional dresses can vary from 2,000 euros to more than 20,000 euros. Some of them are astonishing in beauty. They are accompanied with traditional hair styles and jewelry.\nHistory.\nThere are different conjectures regarding the origin of the Fallas festival. One suggests that the Fallas started in the Middle Ages, when artisans disposed of the broken artefacts and pieces of wood they saved during the winter by burning them to celebrate the spring equinox. Valencian carpenters used planks of wood called \"parots\" to hang their candles on during the winter, as these were needed to provide light to work by. With the coming of the spring, they were no longer necessary, so they were burned. Over time, and with the intervention of the Church, the date of the burning of these \"parots\" was made to coincide with the celebration of the festival of Saint Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters.\nThis tradition continued to evolve. The \"parot\" was dressed with clothing so that it looked like a person; features identifiable with some well-known person from the neighbourhood were often added as well. To collect these materials, children went from house to house asking for \"una estoreta velleta\" (an old rug) to add to the \"parot\". This became a popular song that the children sang as they gathered all sorts of old flammable furniture and utensils to burn in the bonfire with the \"parot\". These \"parots\" were the first \"ninots\". Over the years, people of the neighbourhoods began to organise the building of the \"falles\", and thus the typically intricate constructions, including their various figures, were born.\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century, the \"falles\" were tall boxes with three or four wax dolls dressed in fabric clothing. This changed when the creators began to use cardboard. The fabrication of the \"falles\" continues to evolve in modern times, when the largest displays are made of polystyrene and soft cork easily molded with hot saws. These techniques have allowed the creation of \"falles\" over 30 metres high.\nThe origin of the pagan festival is similar to that of the Bonfires of Saint John celebrated in the Alicante region, in the sense that both came from the Latin custom of lighting fires to welcome spring. In Val\u00e8ncia, this ancient tradition led to the burning of accumulated waste, particularly wood, at the end of winter on the feast day of Saint Joseph. Given the reputed humorous character of Valencians, it was natural that the people began to burn figurines depicting persons and events of the past year. The burning symbolised liberation from living in servitude to the memory of these events or else represented humorous and often critical commentary on them. The festival thus evolved a more satirical and ironic character, and the wooden castoffs gradually came to be assembled into progressively more elaborate 'monuments' that were designed and painted in advance.\nIn the early 20th century, and especially during the Spanish Civil War, the monuments became more anti-clerical in nature and were often highly critical of the local or national governments, which tried to ban the Falles many times, without success. Under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco the celebration lost much of its satirical nature because of government censorship, but the monuments were among the few fervent public expressions allowed then, and they could be made freely in Val\u00e8ncia. During this period, many religious customs such as the offering of flowers to \"Mare de D\u00e9u dels Desamparats\" (Our Lady of the Forsaken) were taken up, which today are essential parts of the festival, even though they were unrelated to the original purpose of the celebration.\nWith the restoration of democracy and the end of government censorship, the critical \"falles\" reappeared, and obscene satirical ones with them. Despite thirty years of freedom of expression, the world view of the \"faller\" can still be socially conservative, is often sexist and may involve some of the amoralism of Valencian politics. This has sometimes led to criticism by certain cultural critics, environmentalists, and progressives. Yet there are celebrants of all ideologies and factions, and they have different interpretations of the spirit of the celebration. Although recent initiatives such as the pilota championships, literary competitions and other events have broadened its cultural expression, the city still embraces such ancient traditions to express its own singular identity.\nFallas suspensions.\nThroughout its history the Fallas have been suspended six times.\nIn 1886 the fallers refused to place the monuments in protest against the increase of the canon from 5 pesetas to 60 pesetas imposed in 1851 that penalized their placement on the street. The follow-up was not complete and there were two failures.\nIn 1896 a state of war was declared because of the Spanish American War, and the Fallas were annulled two days before its beginning.\nIn the years 1937, 1938 and 1939, the Fallas were suspended due to the Spanish Civil War. The suspension did not affect the Fallas of 1936 since they had already been held when the war started. The money destined for the Fallas was destined to the republican cause at the beginning of the war.\nOn 10 March 2020, the Valencian Generalitat, after a Ministry of Health report, decided to suspend and postpone the parties of Fallas and all the acts that comprise it as a result of the coronavirus epidemic as a preventive measure to stop the spread of the virus. The festival was cancelled in 2021 and returned in 2022.\nSecci\u00f3 Especial.\nThe Secci\u00f3 Especial is a group of the largest and most prestigious \"falles\" commissions in the city of Valencia. In 2007, the group consisted of 14 commissions. This class of \"falles\" was first started in 1942 and originally included the \"falles\" of Barques, Reina-Pau and Pla\u00e7a del Mercat. Currently, none of these are still in the group. The commission that has most often participated in this group as of 2015 was Na Jordana, with 62 times. The Secci\u00f3 Especial awards the prizes with the exception of the one awarded by the Valencia City Council; winning the first prize in the Secci\u00f3 Especial is the most prestigious prize any falla can win. All other \"falles\" fall into different classes (18 as of 2017) determined by the amount of money invested in each of these works.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The exact location of Samandar has not been identified; it is generally assumed to be in what is now Dagestan in southern Russia.\nLocation.\nSamandar's exact location is unknown. Medieval Arabic sources report simply that it was midway between Derbent and Atil, near the shore of the Caspian Sea. Modern scholars have variously identified Samandar with Kizlyar on the Terek River, or with Tarki further south on the Caspian coast. Tarki corresponds more closely to medieval sources, as the 10th-century \"Hudud al-'Alam\" reports that Samandar was on the coast; archaeological finds from the Khazar period, including fortifications, have been discovered there.\nSamander may have been moved from an original site to a different, unidentified location, possibly a hill fort in Chechnya near the present-day village of Shelkovskaya on the Terek. \nEtymology.\nThe Russian scholar Svetlana Pletnyova suggested that the name \"Samandar\" meant \"Farthest Gate\" in Middle Persian, and that the town was built by the Sassanid ruler Khosrow I in the 6th century. Other scholars have proposed that the name of the city may derive from the name of a Hunnish tribe \"Zabender\". The Greek writer Theophylact Simocatta refers to a migration of Zabender from Asia to Europe in about 598; in addition, an Armenian book on geography attributed to Moses of Chorene mentions a town \"M-s-n-d-r\" in the land of Huns located to the north of Derbent.\nHistory.\nSamandar became the second capital of the Khazar Khaganate in the 720s, after Balanjar was abandoned as a result of the Umayyad invasion. For the same reason, the capital was moved again further north to Atil, sometime between 730 and 750.\nAccording to the 10th-century geographers al-Istakhri and Ibn Hawqal, Samandar was inhabited by Jews, Christians, Muslims, and members of other religious faiths, each of which had its houses of worship. According to al-Istakhri, Samandar was famous for its fertile gardens and vineyards, and a lively centre of commerce with several markets; the city was mostly built of wood. Samandar, like Atil, was destroyed by Kievan Rus' prince Sviatoslav in the 960s, leading to a decline and disappearance of Khazaria.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Murphy Jr.; its exact origins are debated, but it is generally agreed it originated from Murphy and his team following a mishap during rocket sled tests some time between 1948 and 1949, and was finalized and first popularized by testing project head John Stapp during a later press conference. Murphy's original quote was the precautionary design advice that \"If there are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that way.\"\nThe law entered wider public knowledge in the late 1970s with the publication of Arthur Bloch's 1977 book \"Murphy's Law, and Other Reasons Why Things Go WRONG\", which included other variations and corollaries of the law. Since then, Murphy's law has remained a popular adage, though its accuracy has been disputed by academics. \nSimilar \"laws\" include Sod's law, Finagle's law, and Yhprum's law, among others.\nHistory.\nThe perceived perversity of the universe has long been a subject of comment, and precursors to the modern version of Murphy's law are abundant. According to Robert A. J. Matthews in a 1997 article in \"Scientific American\", the \"name\" \"Murphy's law\" originated in 1949, but the \"concept\" itself had already long since been known. As quoted by Richard Rhodes, Matthews said, \"The familiar version of Murphy's law is not quite 50 years old, but the essential idea behind it has been around for centuries. [\u2026] The modern version of Murphy's Law has its roots in U.S. Air Force studies performed in 1949 on the effects of rapid deceleration on pilots.\" Matthews goes on to explain how Edward A. Murphy Jr. was the eponym, but only because his original thought was modified subsequently into the now established form that is not exactly what he himself had said. Research into the origin of Murphy's law has been conducted by members of the American Dialect Society (ADS). \nMathematician Augustus De Morgan wrote on June 23, 1866: \"The first experiment already illustrates a truth of the theory, well confirmed by practice, what-ever can happen will happen if we make trials enough.\" In later publications \"whatever can happen will happen\" occasionally is termed \"Murphy's law\", which raises the possibility that \"Murphy\" is simply \"De Morgan\" misremembered.\nADS member Stephen Goranson found a version of the law, not yet generalized or bearing that name, in a report by Alfred Holt at an 1877 meeting of an engineering society.\nIt is found that anything that can go wrong at sea generally does go wrong sooner or later, so it is not to be wondered that owners prefer the safe to the scientific\u00a0\u2026 Sufficient stress can hardly be laid on the advantages of simplicity. The human factor cannot be safely neglected in planning machinery. If attention is to be obtained, the engine must be such that the engineer will be disposed to attend to it.\nADS member Bill Mullins found a slightly broader version of the aphorism in reference to stage magic. The British stage magician Nevil Maskelyne wrote in 1908:\nIt is an experience common to all men to find that, on any special occasion, such as the production of a magical effect for the first time in public, everything that \"can\" go wrong \"will\" go wrong. Whether we must attribute this to the malignity of matter or to the total depravity of inanimate things, whether the exciting cause is hurry, worry, or what not, the fact remains.\nIn astronomy, \"Spode's Law\" refers to the phenomenon that the skies are always cloudy at the wrong moment; the law was popularized by amateur astronomer Patrick Moore but dates from the 1930s.\nIn 1948, humorist Paul Jennings coined the term \"resistentialism\", a jocular play on \"resistance\" and \"existentialism\", to describe \"seemingly spiteful behavior manifested by inanimate objects\", where objects that cause problems (like lost keys or a runaway bouncy ball) are said to exhibit a high degree of malice toward humans.\nIn 1952, as an epigraph to the mountaineering book \"The Butcher: The Ascent of Yerupaja\", John Sack described the same principle, \"Anything that can possibly go wrong, does\", as an \"ancient mountaineering adage\".\nAssociation with Murphy.\nDiffering recollections years later by various participants make it impossible to pinpoint who first coined the saying \"Murphy's law\". The law's name supposedly stems from an attempt to use new measurement devices developed by Edward A. Murphy, a United States Air Force (USAF) captain and aeronautical engineer. The phrase was coined in an adverse reaction to something Murphy said when his devices failed to perform and was eventually cast into its present form prior to a press conference some months later \u2013 the first ever (of many) given by John Stapp, a USAF colonel and flight surgeon in the 1950s.\nFrom 1948 to 1949, Stapp headed research project MX981 at Muroc Army Air Field (later renamed Edwards Air Force Base) for the purpose of testing the human tolerance for g-forces during rapid deceleration. The tests used a rocket sled mounted on a railroad track with a series of hydraulic brakes at the end. Initial tests used a humanoid crash test dummy strapped to a seat on the sled, but subsequent tests were performed by Stapp, at that time a USAF captain. During the tests, questions were raised about the accuracy of the instrumentation used to measure the g-forces Captain Stapp was experiencing. Edward Murphy proposed using electronic strain gauges attached to the restraining clamps of Stapp's harness to measure the force exerted on them by his rapid deceleration. Murphy was engaged in supporting similar research using high speed centrifuges to generate g-forces.\nDuring a trial run of this method using a chimpanzee, supposedly around June 1949, Murphy's assistant wired the harness and the rocket sled was launched. The sensors provided a zero reading; however, it became apparent that they had been installed incorrectly, with some sensors wired backwards. It was at this point a frustrated Murphy made his pronouncement, despite being offered the time and chance to calibrate and test the sensor installation prior to the test proper, which he declined somewhat irritably, getting off on the wrong foot with the MX981 team. George E. Nichols, an engineer and quality assurance manager with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was present at the time, recalled in an interview that Murphy blamed the failure on his assistant after the failed test, saying, \"If that guy has any way of making a mistake, he will.\" Nichols' account is that \"Murphy's law\" came about through conversation among the other members of the team; it was condensed to \"If it can happen, it will happen\", and named for Murphy in mockery of what Nichols perceived as arrogance on Murphy's part. Others, including Edward Murphy's surviving son Robert Murphy, deny Nichols' account, and claim that the phrase did originate with Edward Murphy. According to Robert Murphy's account, his father's statement was along the lines of \"If there's more than one way to do a job, and one of those ways will result in disaster, then he will do it that way.\"\nThe phrase first received public attention during a press conference in which Stapp was asked how it was that nobody had been severely injured during the rocket sled tests. Stapp replied that it was because they always took \"Murphy's law\" under consideration; he then summarized the law and said that in general, it meant that it was important to consider all the possibilities (possible things that could go wrong) before doing a test and act to counter them. Thus Stapp's usage and Murphy's alleged usage are very different in outlook and attitude. One is sour, the other an affirmation of the predictable being surmountable, usually by sufficient planning and redundancy. Nichols believes Murphy was unwilling to take the responsibility for the device's initial failure (by itself a blip of no large significance) and is to be doubly damned for not allowing the MX981 team time to validate the sensor's operability and for trying to blame an underling in the embarrassing aftermath.\nThe name \"Murphy's law\" was not immediately secure. A story by Lee Correy in the February 1955 issue of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" referred to \"Reilly's law\", which states that \"in any scientific or engineering endeavor, anything that can go wrong \"will\" go wrong\". Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lewis Strauss was quoted in the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" on February 12, 1955, saying \"I hope it will be known as Strauss' law. It could be stated about like this: If anything bad can happen, it probably will.\"\nMartin Caidin a pilot of the Federal Aviation Agency, in his book Operation Nuke (1973) chapter 13: lists the Murphy's Three Laws of Physics as (1.) Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong. (2.) Whatever's wrong is bound to get worse. (3.) When the first two laws have passed, and you're still around panic. \nArthur Bloch, in the first volume (1977) of his \"Murphy's Law, and Other Reasons Why Things Go WRONG\" series, prints a letter that he received from Nichols, who recalled an event that occurred in 1949 at Edwards Air Force Base that, according to him, is the origination of Murphy's law, and first publicly recounted by Stapp. An excerpt from the letter reads:\nThe law's namesake was Capt. Ed Murphy, a development engineer from Wright Field Aircraft Lab. Frustration with a strap transducer which was malfunctioning due to an error in wiring the strain gage bridges caused him to remark\u00a0\u2013 \"If there is any way to do it wrong, he will\"\u00a0\u2013 referring to the technician who had wired the bridges at the Lab. I assigned Murphy's law to the statement and the associated variations.\nDisputed origins.\nThe association with the Muroc incident is by no means secure. Despite extensive research, no trace of documentation of the saying as \"Murphy's law\" has been found before 1951. The next citations are not found until 1955, when the May\u2013June issue of \"Aviation Mechanics Bulletin\" included the line \"Murphy's law: If an aircraft part can be installed incorrectly, someone will install it that way\", and Lloyd Mallan's book \"Men, Rockets and Space Rats\", referred to: \"Colonel Stapp's favorite takeoff on sober scientific laws\u2014Murphy's law, Stapp calls it\u2014'Everything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong'.\" In 1962, the Mercury Seven attributed Murphy's law to United States Navy training films.\nFred R. Shapiro, the editor of the \"Yale Book of Quotations\", has shown that in 1952 the adage was called \"Murphy's law\" in a book by Anne Roe, quoting an unnamed physicist:\nhe described [it] as \"Murphy's law or the fourth law of thermodynamics\" (actually there were only three last I heard) which states: \"If anything can go wrong, it will.\"\nIn May 1951, Anne Roe gave a transcript of an interview (part of a thematic apperception test, asking impressions on a drawing) with said physicist: \"As for himself he realized that this was the inexorable working of the second law of the thermodynamics which stated Murphy's law 'If anything can go wrong it will'. I always liked 'Murphy's law'. I was told that by an architect.\" ADS member Stephen Goranson, investigating this in 2008 and 2009, found that Anne Roe's papers, held in the American Philosophical Society's archives in Philadelphia, identified the interviewed physicist as Howard Percy \"Bob\" Robertson (1903\u20131961). Robertson's papers at the Caltech archives include a letter in which Robertson offers Roe an interview within the first three months of 1949, making this apparently predate the Muroc incident said to have occurred in or after June 1949.\nJohn Paul Stapp, Edward A. Murphy, Jr., and George Nichols were jointly awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 2003 in engineering \" for (probably) giving birth to the name\". Murphy's Law was also the theme of 2024 Ig Nobel Prize ceremony.\nAcademic and scientific views.\nAccording to Richard Dawkins, so-called laws like Murphy's law and Sod's law are nonsense because they require inanimate objects to have desires of their own, or else to react according to one's own desires. Dawkins points out that a certain class of events may occur all the time, but are only noticed when they become a nuisance. He gives an example of aircraft noise pollution interfering with filming: there are always aircraft in the sky at any given time, but they are only taken note of when they cause a problem. This is a form of confirmation bias, whereby the investigator seeks out evidence to confirm their already-formed ideas, but does not look for evidence that contradicts them.\nSimilarly, David Hand, emeritus professor of mathematics and senior research investigator at Imperial College London, points out that the law of truly large numbers should lead one to expect the kind of events predicted by Murphy's law to occur occasionally. Selection bias will ensure that those ones are remembered and the many times Murphy's law was not true are forgotten.\nThere have been persistent references to Murphy's law associating it with the laws of thermodynamics from early on (see the quotation from Anne Roe's book above). In particular, Murphy's law is often cited as a form of the second law of thermodynamics (the law of entropy) because both are predicting a tendency to a more disorganized state. Atanu Chatterjee investigated this idea by formally stating Murphy's law in mathematical terms and found that Murphy's law so stated could be disproved using the principle of least action.\nVariations (corollaries) of the law.\nFrom its initial public announcement, Murphy's law quickly spread to various technical cultures connected to aerospace engineering. Before long, variations of the law applied to different topics and subjects had passed into the public imagination, changing over time. Arthur Bloch compiled a number of books of corollaries to Murphy's law and variations thereof, the first being \"Murphy's Law, and Other Reasons Why Things Go WRONG\", which received several follow-ups and reprints.\nYhprum's law is an optimistic reversal of Murphy's law, stating that \"anything that can go right will go right\". Its name directly references this, being \"Murphy\" in reverse.\nManagement consultant Peter Drucker formulated \"Drucker's law\" in dealing with complexity of management: \"If one thing goes wrong, everything else will, and at the same time.\"\n\"Mrs. Murphy's law\" is a corollary of Murphy's law, which states that \"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong while Mr. Murphy is out of town.\"\nThe term is sometimes used to describe concise, ironic, humorous rules of thumb that often do not share a relation to the original law or Edward Murphy himself, but still posit him as a relevant expert in the law's subject. Examples of these \"Murphy's laws\" include those for military tactics, technology, romance, social relations, research, and business.\nIn the 2014 film \"Interstellar\", a character's interpretation of the law is that it \"doesn't mean that something bad will happen. It means that whatever \"can\" happen, will happen.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

International Sign (IS) is a term used by the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) and other international organisations.\nHistory.\nDeaf people in the Western and Middle Eastern world have gathered together using sign language for 2,000 years. When Deaf people from different sign language backgrounds get together, a variety of sign language arises from this contact, whether it is in an informal personal context or in a formal international context. Deaf people have therefore used a kind of auxiliary gestural system for international communication at sporting or cultural events since the early 19th century. The need to standardise an international sign system was discussed at the first World Deaf Congress in 1951, when the WFD was formed. In the following years, a pidgin developed as the delegates from different language backgrounds communicated with each other, and in 1973, a WFD committee (\"the Commission of Unification of Signs\") published a standardized vocabulary. They selected \"naturally spontaneous and easy signs in common use by deaf people of different countries\" to make the language easy to learn. A book published by the commission in 1975, \"Gestuno: International Sign Language of the Deaf\", contains a vocabulary list of 1,470 signs. The name \"Gestuno\" was chosen, referencing \"gesture\" and \"oneness\".\nHowever, when Gestuno was first used at the WFD congress in Bulgaria in 1976, it was incomprehensible to deaf participants. Subsequently, it was developed informally by deaf and hearing interpreters, and came to include more grammar, especially linguistic features that are thought to be universal among sign languages, such as role shifting, movement repetitions, the use of signing space, and classifiers. Additionally, the vocabulary was gradually replaced by more iconic signs and loan signs from various sign languages.\nThe first training course in Gestuno was conducted in Copenhagen in 1977 to prepare interpreters for the 5th World Conference on Deafness. Sponsored by the Danish Association of the Deaf and the University of Copenhagen, the course was designed by Robert M. Ingram and taught by Betty L. Ingram, two American interpreters of deaf parents.\nThe name \"Gestuno\" has fallen out of use, and the phrase \"International Sign\" is now more commonly used in English to identify this variety of sign. This may be because current IS has little in common with the signs published under the name \"Gestuno\".\nDescription.\nInternational Sign has been described as a highly variable type of signed communication used between two signers who lack a common sign language. Most experts do not technically consider IS to be a full language, but rather a form of communication that arises on the spot. It is characterized by a focus on iconic or pantomimic structures; IS signers may also point to nearby objects. While some degree of standardization takes place at events such WFD and the European Union of the Deaf, it is limited to vocabulary, not grammar.\nThere is no consensus on what International Sign is exactly. It may either refer to the way strangers sign with each other when they lack a common sign language, or it can refer to a conventionalized form used by a group of people with regular contact. The use of the term \"International Sign\" might also lead to the misconception that it is a standardized form of communication.\nDeaf people typically know only one sign language. Signers from differing countries may use IS spontaneously with each other, with relative success. This communicative success is linked to various factors. First, people who sign in IS have a certain amount of shared contextual knowledge. Secondly, signers may take advantage of shared knowledge of a spoken language, such as English. Thirdly, communication is made easier by the use of iconic signs and pantomime.\nVocabulary.\nThe lexicon of International Sign is made by negotiation between signers. IS signers reportedly use a set of signs from their own national sign language mixed with highly iconic signs that can be understood by a large audience. Many, not to say most, signs are taken from American Sign Language during the past 30 years. In 1973, a committee created and standardized a system of international signs. They tried to choose the most understandable signs from diverse sign languages to make the language easy to learn for not only the Deaf but for both interim management and an everyday observer. IS interpreter Bill Moody noted in a 1994 paper that the vocabulary used in conference settings is largely derived from the sign languages of the Western world and is less comprehensible to those from African or Asian sign language backgrounds. A 1999 study by Bencie Woll suggested that IS signers often use a large amount of vocabulary from their native language, choosing sign variants that would be more easily understood by a foreigner. In contrast, Rachel Rosenstock notes that the vocabulary exhibited in her study of International Sign was largely made up of highly iconic signs common to many sign languages:Over 60% of the signs occurred in the same form in more than eight SLs as well as in IS. This suggests that the majority of IS signs are not signs borrowed from a specific SL, as other studies found, but rather are common to many natural SLs. Only 2% of IS signs were found to be unique to IS. The remaining 38% were borrowed (or \"loan\") signs that could be traced back to one SL or a group of related SLs. International Sign has a simplified lexicon. In IS for example, the English \"who\", \"what\", and \"how\" are all translated simply to \"what\". Another example of this simplified lexicon is the location of the sign itself. IS will use movements on the chest to indicate feeling signs, and signs near the head will indicate cognitive activity.\nThe sign language app and website Spread the Sign offers an International Sign dictionary for International Sign, displaying 718 videos in IS, alongside many more videos in other sign languages. It is run by the European Sign Language Center, an NGO headquartered in \u00d6rebro, Sweden.\nManual alphabet.\nThe manual alphabet of IS belongs to the French family of manual alphabets, specifically in a subgroup around to the modern American manual alphabet. However, some letters differ in a few finger positions to the American alphabet.\nIS numbers larger than five are, unlike in ASL, performed by two hands.\nGrammar.\nVery little is known about the grammar of IS. It tends to use fewer mouthings and often has a larger signing space. The use of mouth gestures for adverbials is emphasized.\nPeople communicating in IS tend to make heavy use of:\nIt has been noted that signers are generally better at interlingual communication than non-signers, even using a spoken lingua franca.\nA paper presented in 1994 suggested that IS signers \"combine a relatively rich and structured grammar with a severely impoverished lexicon\". Supalla and Webb (1995) describe IS as a kind of a pidgin, but conclude that it is \"more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like that of a full sign language\".\nRecent studies of International Sign.\nSimplification of signs in IS can vary between interpreters (one can choose a simplification over a much longer explanation), and because of this, certain information can be lost in translation. Because sign language relies heavily on local influences, many Deaf people do not understand each other's signs. Furthermore, cultural differences in signs can vary even within borders. In these cases, many Deaf people revert to fingerspelling and gestures or mime, which has its own variations based on similar sign language properties.\nThe World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) has raised concern about the issues with simplification and standardization, and that it limits a sign to a single meaning or word, thus losing all natural forms of the initial meaning.\nAn ethnographic study notes that there is some controversy among deaf people about how accessible IS is to deaf people from different places; it also observes that many deaf people are nevertheless highly motivated to do the work of communicating across linguistic and other differences.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has a population of \u00a0(2014 Census)\nFounded 2,600 years ago as the ancient Greek colony Pantikapaion, Kerch is one of the most ancient cities in Crimea. The city experienced rapid growth starting in the 1920s and was the site of a major battle during World War II.\nToday, it is one of the largest cities in Crimea and is among the area's most important industrial, transport and tourist centres. As with the rest of Crimea, it has been occupied by Russian forces since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAncient times.\nArcheological digs at Mayak village near the city ascertained that the area had already been inhabited in the 17th\u201315th centuries BC. While many finds from Kerch can be found in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg and the local museum, a large number of antique sculptures, reliefs, bronze and glassware, ceramics and jewellery were excavated in 1855\u20131856 during the Crimean War by Duncan MacPherson, a surgeon from the British Army, and later donated to the British Museum in London.\nKerch as a city starts its history in the 7th century BC, when Greek colonists from Miletus founded a city-state named Panticapaeum on Mount Mithridat near the mouth of the Melek-Chesme river. Panticapaeum subdued nearby cities and by 480 BC became the capital of the Kingdom of Bosporus. Later, during the rule of Mithradates VI Eupator, Panticapaeum for a short period of time became the capital of the much more powerful and extensive Kingdom of Pontus.\nThe city was located at the intersection of trade routes between the steppe and Europe. This caused it to grow rapidly. The city's main exports were grain and salted fish; wine-making was also common. Panticapaeum minted its own coins. According to extant documents the Melek-Chesme river (small and shallow nowadays) was navigable in Bosporan times, and sea galleys were able to enter the river. Much of the city's population is thought to have been ethnically Scythian, later Sarmatian, as implied by the large Royal Kurgan at Kul-Oba.\nIn the 1st century AD, Panticapaeum and the Kingdom of Bosphorus suffered from Ostrogoth raids; then the city was devastated by the Huns in AD 375.\nThe settlement of Myrmekion was founded by Ionians in the eastern part of what is now Kerch, some four kilometers north-east of ancient Panticapaeum, in the first half of the 6th century BC.\nMiddle Ages.\nFrom the 6th century the city was under the control of the Byzantine Empire. By order of Emperor Justinian I, a citadel named Bospor was built there. Bospor was the centre of a bishopric, the diocese of Bosporus and developed under the influence of Greek Christianity. In 576, it withstood a siege by the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks under Bokhan, aided by Anagai, the last khan (ruler) of the Uturgurs (tribe of Huns).\nIn the 7th century, the Turkic Khazars took control of Bospor, and the city was named Karcha from Turkic \"kar\u015f\u0131\" meaning 'opposite, facing.' The main local government official during Khazar times was the tudun. \nDuring Khazar rule, Kerch was used as a major port for the Khazar slave trade, through which slaves were exported to the Black Sea slave trade.\nChristianity was a major religion in Kerch during the period of Khazar rule. Kerch's Church of St. John the Baptist was founded in 717; thus, it is the oldest church in Ukraine. The Church of the Apostles existed during the late 8th and early 9th centuries, according to the \"Life of the Apostle Andrew\" by Epiphanius of Salamis. \nFollowing the fall of Khazaria to Kievan Rus' in the late 10th century, Kerch became the centre of a Khazar successor-state. Its ruler, Georgius Tzul, was deposed by a Byzantine-Rus expedition in 1016.\nFrom the 10th century, the city was a Slavic settlement named Korchev, which belonged to the Tmutarakan principality. Kerch was a center of trade between Russia', Crimea, Caucasus and the Orient. \nIn the 13th century, Crimea including Korchev was invaded by Mongols. After the Mongols, the city became the Genoese colony of Cerco (Cherkio) in 1318 and served as a sea harbour, where townspeople worked at salt works and fishery.\nIn 1475, the city was passed to the Ottoman Empire. During the Turkish rule Kerch fell into decay and served as a slave-market. It repeatedly suffered from raids of Zaporizhian Cossacks.\n18th\u201320th centuries.\nIn response to the strengthening of Russian military forces in Azov area, the Turks built a fortress, named Yenikale, near Kerch on the shore of Kerch Strait. The fortress was completed by 1706. In 1771 the Imperial Russian Army invaded Crimea and approached Yenikale. The Turks decided to abandon the fortress, though reinforcements from the Ottoman Empire had arrived a few days earlier. By the Peace Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji in 1774, Kerch and Yenikale were ceded to Russia. As a result, the Turkish heritage has been almost completely wiped out.\nIn 1790 Russian naval forces under the command of admiral Fyodor Ushakov defeated the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Kerch Strait.\nBecause of its location, from 1821 Kerch developed into an important trade and fishing port. The state museum of ancient times and a number of educational institutions were opened in the city. The ironwork factory was built in 1846 based on a huge iron ore deposit found on Kerch Peninsula.\nDuring the Crimean War the city was devastated by British forces in 1855.\nIn the late 19th century, mechanical and cement factories were built, and tinned food and tobacco factories were established. By 1900, Kerch was connected to a railroad system, and the fairway of Kerch Strait was deepened and widened. At this time, the population had reached 33,000.\nAfter suffering a decline during the First World War and the Russian Civil War, the city resumed its growth in the late 1920s, with the expansion of various industries, iron ore, and metallurgy in particular, and by 1939 its population had reached 104,500.\nKerch in World War II.\nOn the Eastern Front of World War II from 1941 to 1945, Kerch was the site of heavy fighting between Red Army and Axis forces. After fierce fighting, the city was taken by the Germans in November 1941. On 31 December 1941, the 302nd Mountain Rifle Division recaptured the city following a naval landing operation at Kamysh Burun, to the south of the city, five days earlier. In 1942 the Germans occupied the city again. The Red Army lost over 160,000 men, either killed or taken POW at the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula. On 31 October 1943 another Soviet naval landing operation was launched. Kerch returned to Soviet control on 11 April 1944.\nThe German invaders killed about 15,000 citizens and deported another 14,000 during their occupation. Evidence of German atrocities in Kerch was presented in the Nuremberg trials. After the war, the city was awarded the title Hero City.\nThe Adzhimushkay catacombs in the city's suburbs were the site of guerrilla warfare against the occupation. Thousands of soldiers and refugees found shelter inside and were involved in counterattacks. Many of them died underground, including those who died of numerous alleged poison gas attacks. Later, a memorial was established on the site.\nKerch in Independent Ukraine.\nOn 11 November 2007, a powerful storm passed through the city, causing much damage and an ecological disaster as a few ships, including an oil tanker, were shipwrecked and blocked the Kerch Strait.\nRussian occupation.\nAs with the other parts of Crimea, as of 2023[ [update]] Kerch is occupied by Russian forces following the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014.\nOn 17 October 2018, a student killed 20 people and himself at Kerch Polytechnic College.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nKerch has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfa\") with cool to cold winters and warm to hot summers.\nAdministration.\nThe city municipality stretches over a substantial area and includes several separate neighborhoods that are part of the Kerch city: Eltigen (Heroyevskoe), Kamysh-Burun (Arshyntsevo), Port Krym, Adzhimushkai, and Tuzla Island.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2014, the population of Kerch was 144,626.\nEconomy.\nToday Kerch is home to many metallurgists, shipbuilders, and fishermen. It also has a significant tourism sector.\nIndustry.\nThe largest enterprises in the city are:\nConstruction-materials, food processing, and light industries play a significant role in the city's economy. Kerch is also a fishing fleet base and an important processing centre for numerous fish products.\nTourism.\nBecause of its location on the shores of the Azov and Black seas, Kerch became a popular summer resort among people of the former USSR. Also, several mud-cure sources are located near the city. Despite the seaside location, the tourist appeal of Kerch today is limited because of the industrial character of the city and associated pollution.\nDespite the lack of beaches in the town's area, there are a lot of them at a distance of 20 minutes' travel by bus, train or taxi.\nKerch has a number of impressive architectural and historical monuments. Ancient historical heritage of the city makes it attractive for scientific tourism. The most notable of Kerch's sights are:\nTransport.\nKerch has a harbour on the Kerch Strait, which makes it a key to the Sea of Azov. It has several railroad terminals and a small airport. The Kerch Strait ferry line across the Kerch Strait was established in 1953, connecting Crimea and the Krasnodar Krai (Port Krym \u2013 Port Kavkaz line); (as of November 2009) there are also plans for a Kerch-Poti ferry route.\nTavrida Highway work in progress along Kerch railway (two rails) highway (four lanes) bridge to connect Rostov Krasnodar with peninsula.\nThere are several ports in Kerch, including Kerch Maritime Trading Port, Kerch Maritime Fishing Port, Port Krym (ferry crossing), Kamysh-Burun Port.\nThe railroad terminals include: Kerch, Kerch I, Kerch Factory, Arshyntsevo, and Krym.\nA bus network connects Kerch to other cities in Crimea and Krasnodar Krai.\nCity transport.\nKerch had a tram system that was established in 1935 and destroyed in 1941.\nA trolleybus system was established in 2004, and has one line.\nCrimean Bridge.\nOn 25 April 2010, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed an agreement to build a bridge across the Kerch Strait. In January 2015, with Russia now in control, the contract for the construction of the bridge was awarded to Arkady Rotenberg's S.G.M. Group. In May 2015 construction commenced, and the road section of the bridge was opened to traffic in May 2018. The rail section was opened in 2019, with Russian President Vladimir Putin taking the first train across on 23 December. It was heavily damaged by an explosion on 8 October 2022.\nCulture.\nEducation.\nKerch hosts (2004):\nArchaeology.\nArchaeological digs in Kerch were launched under Russian auspices in the middle of the 19th century. Since then the site of ancient Panticapaeum city on Mount Mithridat has been systematically excavated. Located nearby are several ancient burial mounds (kurgans) and excavated cities. Kerch takes part in UNESCO's \"Silk Road\" programme.\nTreasures and historical findings of Kerch adorn the Lapidarium in Kerch and the collections of major museums around the world. Such as: the Hermitage, the Louvre, the British Museum, the Berlin Museum, the Moscow State Museum of fine arts and many others.\nCurrently, excavations at ancient fortresses of Kerch are led by scientists from Russia, Ukraine, and Poland.\nHonours.\nA minor planet 2216 Kerch discovered in 1971 by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova is named after the city.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While private correspondence from William Stokoe hinted at a formal name for the language in 1960, the first usage of the term \"British Sign Language\" in an academic publication was likely by Aaron Cicourel. Based on the percentage of people who reported 'using British Sign Language at home' on the 2011 Scottish Census, the British Deaf Association estimates there are 151,000 BSL users in the UK, of whom 87,000 are Deaf. By contrast, in the 2011 England and Wales Census 15,000 people living in England and Wales reported themselves using BSL as their main language. People who are not deaf may also use BSL, as hearing relatives of deaf people, sign language interpreters or as a result of other contact with the British Deaf community. The language makes use of space and involves movement of the hands, body, face and head.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nBSL is a creation of the British Deaf community. Unlike home sign, which does not pass between generations, sign languages are shared by a large community of signers.\nRecords show the existence of a sign language within deaf communities in England as far back as the 15th century. The \"History of the Syon Monastery at Lisbon and Brentford\", published in 1450, contains descriptions of signs\u2014some of which are still in use. The earliest known document describing the use of signing in a legal context mentions John de Orleton, a deaf man assigning his property to a family member in 1324. Another commonly cited event is the marriage ceremony between Thomas Tilsye and Ursula Russel in 1576.\nRichard Carew's \"Survey of Cornwall\" (1602) includes a vivid description of Edward Bone, a deaf servant, meeting his deaf friend Kempe. Bone had some knowledge of Cornish and was able to lipread, but appeared to prefer signing. Carew described the situation thus:Somewhat neerre the place of his [Bone's] birth, there dwelt another, so affected, or rather defected, whose name was Kempe: which two, when they chaunced to meete, would use such kinde embracements, such stranfe, often, and earnest tokenings, and such heartie laughtes, and other passionate gestures, that their want of a tongue, seemed rather a hindrance to other conceiving [understanding] them, then to their conceiving one another.John Bulwer, who had an adopted deaf daughter Chirothea Johnson, authored four late-Renaissance texts related to deafness, sign language and the human body: \"Chirologia\" (1644), \"Philocopus\" (1648), \"Pathomyotamia\" (1649) and \"Anthropometamorphosis\" (1650). In particular, \"Chirologia\" focuses on the meanings of gestures, expressions and body language, and describes signs and gestures in use at the time, some of which resemble signs still in use, while \"Philocopus\" explores the use of lipreading by deaf people and the possibility of deaf education, and is dedicated to Bulwer's two deaf brothers.\nAnother writer of the same time, George Dalgarno, recognised that sign language was unrelated to English. In 1661 he wrote that \"The deaf man has no teacher at all and through necessity may put him upon... using signs, yet those have no affinity to the language by which they that are about him do converse among themselves.\"\nFinally, the diarist Samuel Pepys described a conversation between George Downing and a deaf boy in November 1666:But, above all, there comes in the dumb boy that I knew in Oliver's time, who is mightily acquainted here, and with Downing; and he made strange signs of the fire, and how the King was abroad, and many things they understood, but I could not...British Sign Language has evolved, as all languages do, from these origins by modification, invention and importation.\nEarly deaf education.\nThe Braidwood schools.\nThomas Braidwood, a teacher from Edinburgh, founded 'Braidwood's Academy for the Deaf and Dumb' in 1760, which is believed to be the first school for deaf children in Britain. The school primarily taught oral communication methods, as described by Francis Green\u2014whose son attended the Braidwood school\u2014in the anonymous treatise \"Vox oculis subjecta.\" In this account, Green describes how his son Charles would surely develop \"a perfect acquaintance with language both oral and written\", and how deaf pupils were given \"a tolerable general understanding of their own language [English] so as to read, write, and speak it, with ease\". Green also describes Braidwood's views of spoken language:Mr Braidwood hath frequently intimated to me, as an opinion founded upon his experience in this art, that articulate or spoken language hath so great and essential a tendency to confirm and enlarge ideas, above the power of written language, that it is almost impossible for deaf persons, without the use of speech, to be perfect in their ideas.Joseph Watson was trained as a teacher of the deaf under Thomas Braidwood. He eventually left in 1792 to become the headmaster of the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in Bermondsey. He described his teaching methods in detail in his book, \"On the Education of the Deaf and Dumb\" (1809), where he opposed the use of signed versions of spoken language such as the Signed French used in the Paris school. The book contains lists of vocabulary and plates designed to encourage a child to acquire an understanding of written and spoken language.\nInternational links.\nAlthough the Braidwood school focused on speech, it also used an early form of sign language, \"the combined system\", which was the first codification of British Sign Language. The Braidwood school later moved to London and was visited by Abb\u00e9 Sicard and Laurent Clerc in 1815, at the same time that an American Protestant minister, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, travelled to Europe to research teaching of deaf people.\nAndr\u00e9-Daniel Laffon de Ladebat, one of the French visitors to the Braidwood school, provided a vivid description of Laurent Clerc's meeting with the deaf children in the bilingual English/French book, \"A collection of the Most Remarkable Definitions and Answers of Massieu and Clerc, Deaf and Dumb.\" Laurent Clerc, who was deaf, was overjoyed to find fellow sign language users:As soon as Clerc beheld this sight [of the children at dinner] his face became animated; he was as agitated as a traveller of sensibility would be on meeting all of a sudden in distant regions, a colony of his own countrymen... Clerc approached them. He made signs and they answered him by signs. The unexpected communication cause a most delicious sensation in them and for us was a scene of expression and sensibility that gave us the most heart-felt satisfaction.The Braidwood schools refused to teach Gallaudet their methods. Gallaudet then travelled to Paris and learned the educational methods of the French Royal Institution for the Deaf, a combination of Old French Sign Language and the signs developed by Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e. As a consequence American Sign Language (ASL) today has a 60% similarity to modern French Sign Language and is almost unintelligible to users of British Sign Language. Gallaudet went on to establish the American School for the Deaf in 1817, which focused on manual communication and ASL, in contrast to the oral methods used in the UK.\nLate 19th \u2013 21st century.\nUntil the 1940s, sign language skills were passed between deaf people without a unified sign language system; many deaf people lived in residential institutions. \nThe National Deaf Children's Society was founded in 1944 as Society of St John of Beverley.\nSigning was actively discouraged in schools by punishment, and deaf education emphasised teaching deaf children to learn to lip read and finger spell, due to the prevailing belief across Europe established in the 1950s that signing was bad. From the 1970s there has been an increasing tolerance and instruction in BSL in schools. The language continues to evolve as older signs such as \"alms\" and \"pawnbroker\" have fallen out of use and new signs such as \"internet\" and \"laser\" have been coined. The evolution of the language and its changing level of acceptance meant that older users tend to use more finger spelling while younger ones make use of a wider range of signs.\nPaddy Ladd initiated deaf programming on British television in the 1980s and is credited with getting sign language on television and enabling deaf children to be educated in sign.\nLegal recognition.\nBSL users campaigned to have BSL recognised on an official level. Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 mandates the provision of interpreters. \nOn 18 March 2003 the UK government formally recognised that BSL is a language in its own right. \nIn 2021, Rosie Cooper introduced the British Sign Language Bill to recognise BSL as an official language, which was backed by the government. After being dormant from June 2021, the bill began moving through Parliament on 28 January 2022, but during a meeting with stakeholders on 7 February, the language of the bill was revealed to have been pared down substantially, disappointing said stakeholders. The British Deaf Association stated that it was 'unhappy' with this removal of language from the bill.\nLinguistics.\nLinguistics is the study of language, including those like BSL that are not carried by sound. In all sign languages the great majority of 'words' (hand gestures) cannot be understood in other sign languages. How one language signs a certain number would be different from how another language signs it. The way sentences are constructed (syntax) differs from sign language to sign language, just as with different spoken languages. British Sign Language is described as a 'spatial language' as it \"moves signs in space\".\nPhonology.\nLike many other sign languages, BSL phonology is defined by elements such as handshape, orientation, location, movement, and non-manual features. There are phonological components to sign language that have no meaning alone but work together to create a meaning of a signed word: hand shape, movement, location, orientation and facial expression. The meanings of words differ if one of these components is changed. Signs can be identical in certain components but different in others, giving each a different meaning. Facial expression falls under the nonmanual feature component of phonology. These include \"eyebrow height, eye gaze, mouthing, head movement, and torso rotation.\"\nGrammar.\nIn common with other languages, whether spoken or signed, BSL has its own grammar which govern how phrases are signed. BSL has a particular syntax. One important component of BSL is its use of proforms. A proform is \"...any form that stands in the place of, or does the job of, some other form.\" Sentences are composed of two parts, in order: the subject and the predicate. The subject is the topic of the sentence, while the predicate is the commentary about the subject. Question words are generally at the end of a sentence.\nBSL uses a topic\u2013comment structure. Topic-comment means that the topic of the signed conversation is first established, followed by an elaboration of the topic, being the 'comment' component. The canonical word order outside of the topic\u2013comment structure is object\u2013subject\u2013verb (OSV), and noun phrases are head-initial.\nRelationships with other sign languages.\nAlthough the United Kingdom and the United States share English as the predominant spoken language, British Sign Language is quite distinct from American Sign Language (ASL), having only 31% signs identical, or 44% cognate. BSL is also distinct from Irish Sign Language (ISL) (ISG in the ISO system), which is more closely related to French Sign Language (LSF) and ASL.\nIt is also distinct from Signed English, a manually coded method expressed to represent the English language.\nThe sign languages used in Australia and New Zealand, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language respectively, evolved largely from 19th century BSL, and all retain the same manual alphabet and grammar and possess similar lexicons. These three languages may technically be considered dialects of a single language (BANZSL) due to their use of the same grammar and manual alphabet and the high degree of lexical sharing (overlap of signs). The term BANZSL was coined by Trevor Johnston and Adam Schembri.\nIn Australia deaf schools were established by educated deaf people from London, Edinburgh and Dublin. This introduced the London and Edinburgh dialects of BSL to Melbourne and Sydney respectively and Irish Sign Language to Sydney in Roman Catholic schools for the deaf. The language contact post-secondary education between Australian ISL users and 'Australian BSL' users accounts for some of the dialectal differences we see between modern BSL and Auslan. Tertiary education in the US for some deaf Australian adults also accounts for some ASL borrowings found in modern Auslan.\nAuslan, BSL and NZSL have 82% of signs identical (using concepts from a Swadesh list). When considering similar or related signs as well as identical, they are 98% cognate. Further information will be available after completion of the BSL corpus, allows for comparison with the Auslan corpus, and the New Zealand Sign Language project. There continues to be language contact between BSL, Auslan and NZSL through migration (deaf people and interpreters), the media (television programmes such as See Hear, Switch, Rush and SignPost are often recorded and shared informally in all three countries) and conferences (in 1999 many deaf British people travelled to Australia for the World Federation of the Deaf Conference, WFD, in Brisbane.)\nMakaton, a communication system for people with cognitive impairments or other communication difficulties, was originally developed with signs borrowed from British Sign Language. The sign language used in Sri Lanka is also closely related to BSL despite the oral language not being English, demonstrating variation in distance between sign languages and spoken ones.\nUsage.\nBSL has many regional dialects. Certain signs used in Scotland, for example, may not be understood immediately, or not understood at all, by those in Southern England, or vice versa. Some signs are even more local, occurring only in certain towns or cities (such as the Manchester system of number signs). Likewise, some may go in or out of fashion, or evolve over time, just as terms in oral languages do. Families may have signs unique to them to accommodate for certain situations or to describe an object that may otherwise require fingerspelling.\nMany British television channels broadcast programmes with in-vision signing, using BSL, as well as specially made programmes aimed mainly at deaf people such as the BBC's \"See Hear\" and Channel 4's \"VEE-TV\".\nBBC News broadcasts in-vision signing at 07:00-07:30, 08:00-08:30 and 13:00\u201314:00 GMT/BST each weekday. 07:00\u201307:30 on the weekends. BBC Two also broadcasts in-vision signed repeats of the main channel's primetime programmes between 00:00 and 05:00 each weekday and early Saturday mornings. Also provides signing on weekday mornings between 08:00 and 09:00. All BBC channels (excluding BBC One and BBC Alba) provide in-vision signing for some of their programmes. In 2024, over 10% of Channel 4's programming was signed, including popular shows such as Hollyoaks and Gogglebox.\nBSL is used in some educational establishments, but is not always the policy for deaf children in some local authority areas. The Let's Sign BSL and fingerspelling graphics are being developed for use in education by deaf educators and tutors and include many of the regional signs referred to above.\nIn Northern Ireland, there are about 4,500 users of BSL and 1,500 users of Irish Sign Language, an unrelated sign language. A hybrid version, dubbed \"Northern Ireland Sign Language\", is also used.\nIn 2019, over 100 signs for scientific terms, including 'deoxyribonucleotide' and 'deoxyribonucleoside', were added to BSL, after being conceived by Liam Mcmulkin, a deaf graduate of the University of Dundee, who had found finger-spelling such words tiresome, during his degree course.\nNumber of BSL users.\nIn 2016 the British Deaf Association (BDA) says that, based on official statistics, it believes there are 151,000 people who use BSL in the UK, and 87,000 of these are deaf. This figure does not include professional BSL users, interpreters, translators, etc. unless they use BSL at home.\nBritish Sign Language Dictionary.\nThe British Sign Language Dictionary was compiled for the British Deaf Association by the Deaf Studies Research Unit at the University of Durham. It depicts over 1,800 signs through pictures and diagrams, each sign accompanied by definitions, explanations and usage. The signs are ordered not alphabetically, as a dictionary of the English language, but rather according to the phonological characteristics of the language. For example, signs that are based on the \"fist\" handshape come before signs based on the \"open hand\" handshape.\nThe dictionary was edited by David Brien, assisted by a team composed by Mary Brennan, Clark Denmark, Frances Elton, Liz Scott Gibson, Graham Turner and Dorothy Miles, among others.\nThe Dictionary was published in 1992. The foreword was written by Princess Diana, who was the patron of the BDA.\nLearning British Sign Language.\nBritish Sign Language can be learnt from formal institutions throughout the UK and three examination systems exist. Courses are provided by community colleges, local centres for deaf people and private organisations. A teaching qualification program was started by the British Deaf Association in 1984 at the University of Durham, called BSL Tutor Training Course, which closed in 1999.\nNational awarding organisations run training for BSL teachers. Each of these organisations has its own curriculum, teaching materials and resources.\nIn June 2023, the UK Government launched a consultation for a GCSE in British Sign Language with planned teaching beginning in schools from September 2025. This went ahead in England, however, in Wales, the introduction was delayed.\nBecoming a BSL / English interpreter.\nThere are two qualification routes: via post-graduate studies, or via National Vocational Qualifications. Deaf studies undergraduate courses with specific streams for sign language interpreting exist at several British universities; post-graduate level interpreting diplomas are also on offer from universities and one private company. Course entry requirements vary from no previous knowledge of BSL to NVQ level 6 BSL (or equivalent).\nThe qualification process allows interpreters to register with the National Registers of Communication Professionals with Deaf and Deafblind People (NRCPD), a voluntary regulator. Registrants are asked to self-certify that they have both cleared a DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check and are covered by professional indemnity insurance. Completing a level 3 BSL language assessment and enrolling on an approved interpreting course allows applications to register as a TSLI (Trainee Sign Language Interpreter). After completing an approved interpreting course, trainees can then apply to achieve RSLI (Registered Sign Language Interpreter) status. RSLIs are currently required by NRCPD to log Continuous Professional Development activities. Post-qualification, specialist training is still considered necessary to work in specific critical domains.\nCommunication support workers.\nCommunication support workers (CSWs) are professionals who support the communication of deaf students in education at all ages, and deaf people in many areas of work, using British Sign Language and other communication methods such as Sign Supported English. The qualifications and experience of CSWs vary: some are fully qualified interpreters, others are not.\nBSL apps.\nThere are currently two well-established BSL language learning apps and web platforms: Bright BSL and Lingvano.\nLet Sign Shine !\nLet Sign Shine is a campaign started by Norfolk teenager Jade Chapman to raise the awareness of BSL and attract signatures for a petition for BSL to be taught in schools. The campaign's petition to the Parliament of the United Kingdom attracted support from over four thousand people.\nChapman was nominated for the Bernard Matthews Youth Award 2014 for her work and devotion to raising awareness of the importance of sign language. Chapman won the education award category and was presented with an award by Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington.\nChapman was also awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award from the Radio Norwich 99.9 Local Hero Awards on 7 October 2015. The award ceremony featured a performance by Alesha Dixon.\nHaving been donated \u00a31,000 from the Bernard Matthews Youth Award, Let Sign Shine used this to start a British Sign Language course at Dereham Neatherd High School.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47641", "revid": "634249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47641", "title": "Standard Model", "text": "Theory of forces and subatomic particles\nThe Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions \u2013 excluding gravity) in the universe and classifying all known elementary particles. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists worldwide, with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, proof of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy.\nAlthough the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated some success in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some physical phenomena unexplained and so falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. For example, it does not fully explain why there is more matter than anti-matter, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the universe's accelerating expansion as possibly described by dark energy. The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses.\nThe development of the Standard Model was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike. The Standard Model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory for theorists, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena, including spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies, and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.\nHistorical background.\nIn 1928, Paul Dirac introduced the Dirac equation, which implied the existence of antimatter.\nIn 1954, Yang Chen-Ning and Robert Mills extended the concept of gauge theory for abelian groups, e.g. quantum electrodynamics, to nonabelian groups to provide an explanation for strong interactions. In 1957, Chien-Shiung Wu demonstrated parity was not conserved in the weak interaction. \nIn 1961, Sheldon Glashow combined the electromagnetic and weak interactions. In 1964, Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig introduced quarks and that same year Oscar W. Greenberg implicitly introduced color charge of quarks. In 1967 Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow's electroweak interaction, giving it its modern form.\nIn 1970, Sheldon Glashow, John Iliopoulos, and Luciano Maiani introduced the GIM mechanism, predicting the charm quark. In 1973 Gross and Wilczek and Politzer independently discovered that non-Abelian gauge theories, like the color theory of the strong force, have asymptotic freedom. In 1976, Martin Perl discovered the tau lepton at the SLAC. In 1977, a team led by Leon Lederman at Fermilab discovered the bottom quark.\nThe Higgs mechanism is believed to give rise to the masses of all the elementary particles in the Standard Model. This includes the masses of the W and Z bosons, and the masses of the fermions, i.e. the quarks and leptons.\nAfter the neutral weak currents caused by Z boson exchange were discovered at CERN in 1973, the electroweak theory became widely accepted and Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering it. The W\u00b1 and Z0 bosons were discovered experimentally in 1983; and the ratio of their masses was found to be as the Standard Model predicted.\nThe theory of the strong interaction (i.e. quantum chromodynamics, QCD), to which many contributed, acquired its modern form in 1973\u201374 when asymptotic freedom was proposed (a development that made QCD the main focus of theoretical research) and experiments confirmed that the hadrons were composed of fractionally charged quarks.\nThe term \"Standard Model\" was introduced by Abraham Pais and Sam Treiman in 1975, with reference to the electroweak theory with four quarks. Steven Weinberg has since claimed priority, explaining that he chose the term Standard Model out of a sense of modesty and used it in 1973 during a talk in Aix-en-Provence in France.\nParticle content.\nThe Standard Model includes members of several classes of elementary particles, which in turn can be distinguished by other characteristics, such as color charge.\nAll particles can be summarized as follows:\nFermions.\nThe Standard Model includes 12 elementary particles of spin , known as fermions. Fermions respect the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning that two identical fermions cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state in the same atom. Each fermion has a corresponding antiparticle, which are particles that have corresponding properties with the exception of opposite charges. Fermions are classified based on how they interact, which is determined by the charges they carry, into two groups: quarks and leptons. Within each group, pairs of particles that exhibit similar physical behaviors are then grouped into generations (see the table). Each member of a generation has a greater mass than the corresponding particle of generations prior. Thus, there are three generations of quarks and leptons. As first-generation particles do not decay, they comprise all of ordinary (baryonic) matter. Specifically, all atoms consist of electrons orbiting around the atomic nucleus, ultimately constituted of up and down quarks. On the other hand, second- and third-generation charged particles decay with very short half-lives and can only be observed in high-energy environments. Neutrinos of all generations also do not decay, and pervade the universe, but rarely interact with baryonic matter.\nThere are six quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Quarks carry color charge, and hence interact via the strong interaction. The color confinement phenomenon results in quarks being strongly bound together such that they form color-neutral composite particles called hadrons; quarks cannot individually exist and must always bind with other quarks. Hadrons can contain either a quark-antiquark pair (mesons) or three quarks (baryons). The lightest baryons are the nucleons: the proton and neutron. Quarks also carry electric charge and weak isospin, and thus interact with other fermions through electromagnetism and weak interaction. The six leptons consist of the electron, electron neutrino, muon, muon neutrino, tau, and tau neutrino. The leptons do not carry color charge, and do not respond to strong interaction. The charged leptons carry an electric charge of \u22121\u00a0\"e\", while the three neutrinos carry zero electric charge. Thus, the neutrinos' motions are influenced by only the weak interaction and gravity, making them difficult to observe.\nGauge bosons.\nThe Standard Model includes 4 kinds of gauge bosons of spin 1, with bosons being quantum particles containing an integer spin. The gauge bosons are defined as force carriers, as they are responsible for mediating the fundamental interactions. The Standard Model explains the four fundamental forces as arising from the interactions, with fermions exchanging virtual force carrier particles, thus mediating the forces. At a macroscopic scale, this manifests as a force. As a result, they do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle that constrains fermions; bosons do not have a theoretical limit on their spatial density. The types of gauge bosons are described below.\nThe Feynman diagram calculations, which are a graphical representation of the perturbation theory approximation, invoke \"force mediating particles\", and when applied to analyze high-energy scattering experiments are in reasonable agreement with the data. However, perturbation theory (and with it the concept of a \"force-mediating particle\") fails in other situations. These include low-energy quantum chromodynamics, bound states, and solitons. The interactions between all the particles described by the Standard Model are summarized by the diagrams on the right of this section.\nHiggs boson.\nThe Higgs particle is a massive scalar elementary particle theorized by Peter Higgs (and others) in 1964, when he showed that Goldstone's 1962 theorem (generic continuous symmetry, which is spontaneously broken) provides a third polarisation of a massive vector field. Hence, Goldstone's original scalar doublet, the massive spin-zero particle, was proposed as the Higgs boson, and is a key building block in the Standard Model. It has no intrinsic spin, and for that reason is classified as a boson with spin-0.\nThe Higgs boson plays a unique role in the Standard Model, by explaining why the other elementary particles, except the photon and gluon, are massive. In particular, the Higgs boson explains why the photon has no mass, while the W and Z bosons are very heavy. Elementary-particle masses and the differences between electromagnetism (mediated by the photon) and the weak force (mediated by the W and Z bosons) are critical to many aspects of the structure of microscopic (and hence macroscopic) matter. In electroweak theory, the Higgs boson generates the masses of the leptons (electron, muon, and tau) and quarks. As the Higgs boson is massive, it must interact with itself.\nBecause the Higgs boson is a very massive particle and also decays almost immediately when created, only a very high-energy particle accelerator can observe and record it. Experiments to confirm and determine the nature of the Higgs boson using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN began in early 2010 and were performed at Fermilab's Tevatron until its closure in late 2011. Mathematical consistency of the Standard Model requires that any mechanism capable of generating the masses of elementary particles must become visible at energies above ; therefore, the LHC (designed to collide two proton beams) was built to answer the question of whether the Higgs boson actually exists.\nOn 4 July 2012, two of the experiments at the LHC (ATLAS and CMS) both reported independently that they had found a new particle with a mass of about (about 133 proton masses, on the order of ), which is \"consistent with the Higgs boson\". On 13 March 2013, it was confirmed to be the searched-for Higgs boson.\nTheoretical aspects.\nConstruction of the Standard Model Lagrangian.\nTechnically, quantum field theory provides the mathematical framework for the Standard Model, in which a Lagrangian controls the dynamics and kinematics of the theory. Each kind of particle is described in terms of a dynamical field that pervades space-time.\nThe construction of the Standard Model proceeds following the modern method of constructing most field theories: by first postulating a set of symmetries of the system, and then by writing down the most general renormalizable Lagrangian from its particle (field) content that observes these symmetries.\nThe global Poincar\u00e9 symmetry is postulated for all relativistic quantum field theories. It consists of the familiar translational symmetry, rotational symmetry and the inertial reference frame invariance central to the theory of special relativity. The local SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) gauge symmetry is an internal symmetry that essentially defines the Standard Model. Roughly, the three factors of the gauge symmetry give rise to the three fundamental interactions. The fields fall into different representations of the various symmetry groups of the Standard Model (see table). Upon writing the most general Lagrangian, one finds that the dynamics depends on 19 parameters, whose numerical values are established by experiment. The parameters are summarized in the table (made visible by clicking \"show\") above.\nQuantum chromodynamics sector.\nThe quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sector defines the interactions between quarks and gluons, which is a Yang\u2013Mills gauge theory with SU(3) symmetry, generated by formula_1. Since leptons do not interact with gluons, they are not affected by this sector. The Dirac Lagrangian of the quarks coupled to the gluon fields is given by\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 is a three component column vector of Dirac spinors, each element of which refers to a quark field with a specific color charge (i.e. red, blue, and green) and summation over flavor (i.e. up, down, strange, etc.) is implied. \nThe gauge covariant derivative of QCD is defined by formula_4, where\nThe QCD Lagrangian is invariant under local SU(3) gauge transformations; i.e., transformations of the form formula_6, where formula_7 is 3 \u00d7 3 unitary matrix with determinant 1, making it a member of the group SU(3), and formula_8 is an arbitrary function of spacetime.\nElectroweak sector.\nThe electroweak sector is a Yang\u2013Mills gauge theory with the symmetry group U(1) \u00d7 SU(2)L,\nformula_9\nwhere the subscript formula_10 sums over the three generations of fermions; formula_11, and formula_12 are the left-handed doublet, right-handed singlet up type, and right handed singlet down type quark fields; and formula_13 and formula_14 are the left-handed doublet and right-handed singlet lepton fields. \nThe electroweak gauge covariant derivative is defined as formula_15, where \nNotice that the addition of fermion mass terms into the electroweak Lagrangian is forbidden, since terms of the form formula_19 do not respect U(1) \u00d7 SU(2)L gauge invariance. Neither is it possible to add explicit mass terms for the U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields. The Higgs mechanism is responsible for the generation of the gauge boson masses, and the fermion masses result from Yukawa-type interactions with the Higgs field.\nHiggs sector.\nIn the Standard Model, the Higgs field is an SU(2)L doublet of complex scalar fields with four degrees of freedom:\nformula_20\nwhere the superscripts + and 0 indicate the electric charge formula_21 of the components. The weak hypercharge formula_22 of both components is 1. Before symmetry breaking, the Higgs Lagrangian is\nformula_23\nwhere formula_24 is the electroweak gauge covariant derivative defined above and formula_25 is the potential of the Higgs field. The square of the covariant derivative leads to three and four point interactions between the electroweak gauge fields formula_26 and formula_27 and the scalar field formula_28. The scalar potential is given by\nformula_29\nwhere formula_30, so that formula_28 acquires a non-zero Vacuum expectation value, which generates masses for the Electroweak gauge fields (the Higgs mechanism), and formula_32, so that the potential is bounded from below. The quartic term describes self-interactions of the scalar field formula_28.\nThe minimum of the potential is degenerate with an infinite number of equivalent ground state solutions, which occurs when formula_34. It is possible to perform a gauge transformation on formula_28 such that the ground state is transformed to a basis where formula_36 and formula_37. This breaks the symmetry of the ground state. The expectation value of formula_28 now becomes \nformula_39\nwhere formula_40 has units of mass and sets the scale of electroweak physics. This is the only dimensional parameter of the Standard Model and has a measured value of ~. \nAfter symmetry breaking, the masses of the W and Z are given by formula_41 and formula_42, which can be viewed as predictions of the theory. The photon remains massless. The mass of the Higgs boson is formula_43. Since formula_44 and formula_45 are free parameters, the Higgs's mass could not be predicted beforehand and had to be determined experimentally.\nYukawa sector.\nThe Yukawa interaction terms are:\nformula_46\nwhere formula_47, formula_48, and formula_49 are 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 matrices of Yukawa couplings, with the mn term giving the coupling of the generations m and n, and h.c. means Hermitian conjugate of preceding terms. The fields formula_50 and formula_13 are left-handed quark and lepton doublets. Likewise, formula_52 and formula_14 are right-handed up-type quark, down-type quark, and lepton singlets. Finally formula_28 is the Higgs doublet and formula_55 is its charge conjugate state.\nThe Yukawa terms are invariant under the SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y gauge symmetry of the Standard Model and generate masses for all fermions after spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nFundamental interactions.\nThe Standard Model describes three of the four fundamental interactions in nature; only gravity remains unexplained. In the Standard Model, such an interaction is described as an exchange of bosons between the objects affected, such as a photon for the electromagnetic force and a gluon for the strong interaction. Those particles are called force carriers or messenger particles.\nGravity.\nDespite being perhaps the most familiar fundamental interaction, gravity is not described by the Standard Model, due to contradictions that arise when combining general relativity, the modern theory of gravity, and quantum mechanics. However, gravity is so weak at microscopic scales, that it is essentially unmeasurable. The graviton is postulated to be the mediating particle, but has not yet been proved to exist.\nElectromagnetism.\nElectromagnetism is the only long-range force in the Standard Model. It is mediated by photons and couples to electric charge. Electromagnetism is responsible for a wide range of phenomena including atomic electron shell structure, chemical bonds, electric circuits and electronics. Electromagnetic interactions in the Standard Model are described by quantum electrodynamics.\nWeak interaction.\nThe weak interaction is responsible for various forms of particle decay, such as beta decay. It is weak and short-range, due to the fact that the weak mediating particles, W and Z bosons, have mass. W bosons have electric charge and mediate interactions that change the particle type (referred to as flavor) and charge. Interactions mediated by W bosons are charged current interactions. Z bosons are neutral and mediate neutral current interactions, which do not change particle flavor. Thus Z bosons are similar to the photon, aside from them being massive and interacting with the neutrino. The weak interaction is also the only interaction to violate parity and CP. Parity violation is maximal for charged current interactions, since the W boson interacts exclusively with left-handed fermions and right-handed antifermions.\nIn the Standard Model, the weak force is understood in terms of the electroweak theory, which states that the weak and electromagnetic interactions become united into a single \"electroweak\" interaction at high energies.\nStrong interaction.\nThe strong interaction is responsible for hadronic and nuclear binding. It is mediated by gluons, which couple to color charge. Since gluons themselves have color charge, the strong force exhibits confinement and asymptotic freedom. Confinement means that only color-neutral particles can exist in isolation, therefore quarks can only exist in hadrons and never in isolation, at low energies. Asymptotic freedom means that the strong force becomes weaker, as the energy scale increases. The strong force overpowers the electrostatic repulsion of protons and quarks in nuclei and hadrons respectively, at their respective scales.\nWhile quarks are bound in hadrons by the fundamental strong interaction, which is mediated by gluons, nucleons are bound by an emergent phenomenon termed the \"residual strong force\" or \"nuclear force\". This interaction is mediated by mesons, such as the pion. The color charges inside the nucleon cancel out, meaning most of the gluon and quark fields cancel out outside of the nucleon. However, some residue is \"leaked\", which appears as the exchange of virtual mesons, which result in an effective attractive force between nucleons. The (fundamental) strong interaction is described by quantum chromodynamics, which is a component of the Standard Model.\nTests and predictions.\nThe Standard Model predicted the existence of the W and Z bosons, gluon, top quark and charm quark, and predicted many of their properties before these particles were observed. The predictions were experimentally confirmed with good precision.\nThe Standard Model also predicted the existence of the Higgs boson, which was found in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider, the final fundamental particle predicted by the Standard Model to be experimentally confirmed.\nChallenges.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in physics\nMore unsolved problems in physics\nSelf-consistency of the Standard Model (currently formulated as a non-abelian gauge theory quantized through path-integrals) has not been mathematically proved. While regularized versions useful for approximate computations (for example lattice gauge theory) exist, it is not known whether they converge (in the sense of S-matrix elements) in the limit that the regulator is removed. A key question related to the consistency is the Yang\u2013Mills existence and mass gap problem.\nExperiments indicate that neutrinos have mass, which the classic Standard Model did not allow. To accommodate this finding, the classic Standard Model can be modified to include neutrino mass, although it is not obvious exactly how this should be done.\nIf one insists on using only Standard Model particles, this can be achieved by adding a non-renormalizable interaction of leptons with the Higgs boson. On a fundamental level, such an interaction emerges in the seesaw mechanism where heavy right-handed neutrinos are added to the theory.\nThis is natural in the left-right symmetric extension of the Standard Model and in certain grand unified theories. As long as new physics appears below or around 1014 GeV, the neutrino masses can be of the right order of magnitude.\nTheoretical and experimental research has attempted to extend the Standard Model into a unified field theory or a theory of everything, a complete theory explaining all physical phenomena including constants. Inadequacies of the Standard Model that motivate such research include:\nCurrently, no proposed theory of everything has been widely accepted or verified.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47642", "revid": "33683263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47642", "title": "Castling", "text": "Chess move\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCastling is a move in chess. It consists of moving the king two squares toward a rook on the same &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;rank&lt;/dfn&gt; and then moving the rook to the square that the king passed over. Castling is permitted only if neither the king nor the rook has previously moved; the squares between the king and the rook are vacant; and the king does not leave, cross over, or finish on a square attacked by an enemy piece. Castling is the only move in chess in which two pieces are moved at once.\nCastling with the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;king's rook&lt;/dfn&gt; is called \"kingside castling\", and castling with the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;queen's rook&lt;/dfn&gt; is called \"queenside castling\". In both algebraic and descriptive notations, castling kingside is written as 0-0 and castling queenside as 0-0-0.\nCastling originates from the \"king's leap\", a two-square king move added to European chess between the 14th and 15th centuries, and took on its present form in the 17th century. Local variations in castling rules were common, however, persisting in Italy until the late 19th century. Castling does not exist in Asian games of the chess family, such as shogi, xiangqi, and janggi, but it commonly appears in variants of Western chess.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC_left/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRules.\nDescription.\nDuring castling, the king is shifted two squares toward a rook of the same color on the same rank, and the rook is transferred to the square crossed by the king. There are two forms of castling:\nRequirements.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCastling is permitted provided all of the following conditions are met:\nConditions 3 and 4 can be summarized by the mnemonic: A player may not castle out of, through, or into check.\nCastling rules often cause confusion, even occasionally among high-level players. Alexander Beliavsky and Viktor Korchnoi both had to consult the arbiter during tournaments on whether castling was legal when the rook was on or passed over an attacked square, Yuri Averbakh once mistakenly thought that Black queenside castling was illegal when b8 was attacked, and Nigel Short once attempted to castle queenside as Black when d8 was under attack (this was not allowed). Illegal castling has also occasionally occurred in serious games between top players (including Gata Kamsky, Viktor Korchnoi, and Richard R\u00e9ti) when they forgot that the king or rook had previously moved and returned to its home square, and has not always been noticed by the opponent. Yasser Seirawan once accidentally castled queenside as White with his queen's rook on b1 (which was not allowed), and Alexander Alekhine once \"castled his queen\" (moving his queen from d1 to b1 and his rook from a1 to c1, which was also not allowed). To clarify:\nTournament rules.\nUnder FIDE rules and USCF rules, and enforced in most tournaments, castling is considered a king move, so the king must be touched first; if the rook is touched first, a rook move must be played instead. As usual, the player may choose another legal destination square for the king until releasing it. When the two-square king move is completed, however, the player is committed to castling if it is legal, and the rook must be moved accordingly. The entire move must be completed with one hand. A player who attempts to castle illegally must return the king and rook to their original squares and then make a legal king move if possible (which may include castling on the other side). If there is no legal king move, the touch-move rule does not apply to the rook.\nThese tournament rules are not commonly enforced in &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;informal play&lt;/dfn&gt; nor commonly known by casual players.\nCastling rights.\nAn unmoved king has \"castling rights\" with an unmoved rook of the same color on the same rank, even if castling is not legal in that particular position. In the context of threefold and fivefold repetition, two otherwise identical positions with different castling rights are considered to be different positions.\nIn a 1986 game between Anatoly Karpov and Tony Miles, play continued from the diagrammed position as follows:\n 22. ... Ra4\n 23. Nc3 Ra8\n 24. Nb5 Ra4\n 25. Nc3 Ra8\n 26. Nb5\nWith his 26th move, Karpov attempted to claim a draw by threefold repetition, thinking that the positions after his 22nd, 24th, and 26th moves were the same. It was pointed out to him, however, that the position after his 22nd move had different castling rights than the positions after his 24th and 26th moves (the rook being unmoved prior to 22. ... Ra4, meaning Black still had castling rights in that position), rendering his claim illegal. As a result, Karpov was penalized five minutes on his clock. After thinking for about ten minutes, Miles decided to agree to a draw anyway (even an incorrect claim of threefold repetition is also a draw offer).\nNotation.\nBoth algebraic notation and descriptive notation indicate kingside castling as 0-0 and queenside castling as 0-0-0 (using the digit zero). Portable Game Notation and some publications use O-O for kingside castling and O-O-O for queenside castling (using the letter O) instead. ICCF numeric notation indicates castling based on the starting and ending squares of the king; thus, castling kingside is written as 5171 for White and 5878 for Black, and castling queenside is written as 5131 for White and 5838 for Black.\nHistory.\nCastling has its roots in the \"king's leap\". There were two forms of the leap: the king would move once like a knight, or the king would move two squares on its first move. The knight move might be used early in the game to get the king to safety or later in the game to escape a threat. This second form was played in Europe as early as the 13th century. In North Africa, the king was transferred to a safe square by a two-move procedure: the king moved to the player's second &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;rank&lt;/dfn&gt;, and the rook and king moved to each other's original squares.\nVarious forms of castling were developed due to the spread of rulesets during the 15th and 16th centuries which increased the power of the queen and bishop, allowing these pieces to attack from a distance and from both sides of the board, thus increasing the importance of king safety.\nThe rule of castling has varied by location and time. In medieval England, Spain, and France, the white king was allowed to jump to c1, c2, d3, e3, f3, or g1 if no capture was made and the king was not in check and did not move over check; the black king might move analogously. In Lombardy, the white king might also jump to a2, b1, or h1, with corresponding squares applying to the black king. Later, in Germany and Italy, the rule was changed such that the king move was accompanied by a pawn move.\nIn the G\u00f6ttingen manuscript (c. 1500) and a game published by Luis Ram\u00edrez de Lucena in 1498, castling consisted of moving the rook and then moving the king on separate moves.\nThe current version of castling was established in France in 1620 and in England in 1640. It served to combine the rook's move and the king's jumping move into a single move.\nIn Rome, from the early 17th century until the late 19th century, the rook might be placed on any square up to and including the king's square, and the king might be moved to any square on the other side of the rook. This was called \"free castling\".\nIn the 1811 edition of his chess treatise, Johann Allgaier introduced the 0-0 notation. He differentiated between 0-0r (right) and 0-0l (left). The 0-0-0 notation for queenside castling was introduced in 1837 by Aaron Alexandre. The practice was adopted in the first edition (1843) of the influential \"Handbuch des Schachspiels\" and soon became standard. In English descriptive notation, the word \"Castles\" was originally spelled out, adding \"K's R\" or \"Q's R\" if disambiguation was needed; eventually, the 0-0 and 0-0-0 notation was borrowed from the algebraic system.\nStrategic and tactical concepts.\nStrategy.\nCastling is generally an important goal in the opening: it moves the king to safety away from the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;center files&lt;/dfn&gt; of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position (the f-file if castling kingside; the d-file if castling queenside).\nThe choice regarding to which side one castles often hinges on an assessment of the trade-off between king safety and activity of the rook. Kingside castling is generally slightly safer because the king ends up closer to the edge of the board and can usually defend all of the pawns on the castled side. In queenside castling, the king is placed closer to the center and does not defend the pawn on the a-&lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;file&lt;/dfn&gt;; for these reasons, the king is often subsequently moved to the b-file. In addition, queenside castling is initially obstructed by more pieces than kingside castling, thus taking longer to set up than kingside castling. On the other hand, queenside castling places the rook more efficiently on the central d-file, where it is often immediately active; meanwhile, with kingside castling, a tempo may be required to move the rook to a more effective square.\nPlayers may forgo castling for various reasons. In positions where the opponent cannot organize an attack against a centralized king, castling may be unnecessary or even detrimental. In addition, in certain situations, a rook can be more active near the edges of the board than in the center; for example, if it is able to fight for control of an open or semi-open file.\nKingside castling occurs more frequently than queenside castling. It is common for both players to castle kingside, less common for one player to castle kingside and the other queenside, and uncommon for both players to castle queenside. If one player castles kingside and the other queenside, it is called \"opposite castling\" or \"opposite-side castling\". Castling on opposite sides usually results in a fierce fight, as each player's pawns are free to advance to attack the opponent's castled position without exposing the player's own castled king. Opposite castling is a common feature of many openings, such as the Yugoslav Attack.\nTactics involving castling.\nTactical patterns involving castling are rare. One pattern involves castling queenside to deliver a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;double attack&lt;/dfn&gt;: the king attacks a rook (on b2 for White or b7 for Black), while the rook attacks a second enemy piece (usually the king). In the example shown, from the game Mattison\u2013Millers, K\u00f6nigsberg 1926, Black played 13...Rxb2?? and resigned after 14.0-0-0+, which wins the rook.\nChess historian Edward Winter has proposed the name \"Thornton castling trap\" for this pattern, in reference to the earliest known example, Thornton\u2013Boultbee, published in the \"Brooklyn Chess Chronicle\" in 1884. Other chess writers such as Gary Lane have since adopted this term.\nAnother example of tactical castling is illustrated in the diagrammed position from the correspondence game Gurvich\u2013Pampin, 1976. After 1.Qxd8+ Kxd8 2.0-0-0+ Ke7 3.Nxb5, White has won a rook by castling with check and simultaneously unpinning the knight.\nSuch a double attack can also be made by castling kingside, although this is much rarer. In this position from the blindfold game Karjakin\u2013Carlsen, 2007, the move 19...0-0 threatens to win the knight on g5, which cannot move without losing the rook on h7. White cannot attempt to win back the piece with a fork due to the threat of back rank mate: 20.Rh6 Bxg5 21.Rxg6+ Kh7 22.Rxg5 would be met by 22...Rf1#. Karjakin had to concede a piece and resigned 14 moves later.\nExamples.\nKorchnoi vs. Karpov.\nViktor Korchnoi, in his 1974 Candidates final match with Anatoly Karpov, asked the arbiter if castling was legal when the castling rook was under attack. The arbiter answered in the affirmative, Korchnoi executed the move, and Karpov resigned shortly after. \nHeidenfeld vs. Kerins.\nCastling occurred three times in the game Wolfgang Heidenfeld\u2013Nick Kerins, Dublin 1973. The third instance of castling, the second one by White, was illegal, as the white king had already moved. The game is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Be3 Nf6 4.e5 Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.c3 Nc6 7.Nf3 Qb6 8.Qd2 c4 9.Be2 Na5 10.0-0 f5 11.Ng5 Be7 12.g4 Bxg5 13.fxg5 Nf8 14.gxf5 exf5 15.Bf3 Be6 16.Qg2 0-0-0 17.Na3 Ng6 18.Qd2 f4 19.Bf2 Bh3 20.Rfb1 Bf5 21.Nc2 h6 22.gxh6 Rxh6 23.Nb4 Qe6 24.Qe2 Ne7 25.b3 Qg6+ 26.Kf1 Bxb1 27.bxc4 dxc4 28.Qb2 Bd3+ 29.Ke1 Be4 30.Qe2 Bxf3 31.Qxf3 Rxh2 32.d5 Qf5 33.0-0-0 Rh3 34.Qe2 Rxc3+ 35.Kb2 Rh3 36.d6 Nec6 37.Nxc6 Nxc6 38.e6 Qe5+ 39.Qxe5 Nxe5 40.d7+ Nxd7 0\u20131\nAverbakh vs. Purdy.\nIn the game Yuri Averbakh\u2013Cecil Purdy, Adelaide 1960, when Purdy castled queenside, Averbakh queried the move, pointing out that the rook had passed over an attacked square. Purdy indicated e8 and c8 and said, \"The king\", in an attempt to explain that this was forbidden only for the king. Averbakh replied, \"Only the king? Not the rook?\" Averbakh's colleague Vladimir Bagirov then explained the castling rules to him in Russian, and the game continued.\nEdward Lasker vs. Thomas.\nIn the game Edward Lasker\u2013Sir George Thomas (London 1912), White could have checkmated with 18.0-0-0#, but he instead played 18.Kd2#. (See Edward Lasker's notable games.)\nPrins vs. Day.\nThe diagram shows the final position of the game Lodewijk Prins\u2013Lawrence Day (1968), where White resigned. Had the game continued, Black could have checkmated by castling:\n29. Kf6 Qf5+ 30. Kg7 Qg6+ 31. Kh8 0-0-0#\nFeuer vs. O'Kelly.\nIn the 1934 Belgian Championship, Otto Feuer caught Alb\u00e9ric O'Kelly in the Thornton castling trap. In the position in the diagram, the game continued 10...Rxb2 11.dxe5 dxe5?? 12.Qxd8+ Kxd8 13.0-0-0+, and O'Kelly resigned. Feuer's last move simultaneously gave check and attacked the rook on b2.\nFischer vs. Najdorf.\nThe diagram illustrates the consequences of losing castling rights. Fischer, with the white pieces, played 16.Ng7+ Ke7 17.Nf5+ Ke8. Although all the pieces were now on the same squares, the two positions were not identical because Black, having moved his king, no longer had the right to castle. White now had time to build pressure on the black king without worrying that the king might escape by castling.\nArtificial castling.\n\"Artificial castling\", also known as \"castling by hand\", is a maneuver whereby a player achieves a castled position without the use of castling.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the first diagram (arising from the Ruy Lopez, Classical Defence):\n1. Nxe5 Bxf2+?!\nBlack sees that if he plays 1...Nxe5, White responds with 2.d4, winning back the minor piece with a fork and taking control of the center. Instead of allowing this, Black hopes to cause trouble for White by returning the piece while depriving White of the right to castle. White can easily castle artificially, however. For example:\n2. Kxf2 Nxe5 3. Rf1\nWhite begins castling artificially.\n3... Ne7 4. Kg1 (second diagram)\nWhite has achieved a normal castled position via several moves. With the bishop pair and a central pawn majority, White has a slight advantage.\nCastling in chess variants.\nVariants of Western chess often include castling in their rulesets, sometimes in a modified form.\nIn variants played on a standard 8\u00d78 board, castling is often the same as in standard chess. This includes variants that replace the king with a different royal piece, as is the case with the knight in Knightmate. Some variants, however, have different rules; for example, in Chess960, the king may move more or fewer than two squares (including none) when castling, depending on the starting position. Former world Fischer Random Chess Champion Wesley So was confused by the castling rules during the 2022 championships, and attempted to illegally castle out of check versus Ian Nepomniachtchi.\nCastling can also be adapted to variants with different board sizes and shapes. Some such variants, like Capablanca chess (10\u00d78) or chess on a really big board (16\u00d716), preserve the castling movement of the rooks, meaning that the king moves a different distance along the &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;back rank&lt;/dfn&gt;. In a few variants, most notably Wildebeest chess (11\u00d710), the player may choose to move the king any distance and move the rook accordingly.\nCastling sometimes features in chess variants not played on a square grid, such as masonic chess, triangular chess, Shafran's and Brusky's hexagonal chess, and millennium 3D chess. In \"5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel\", castling is possible within the spatial dimensions but not across time or between timelines.\nSome chess variants do not feature castling, such as losing chess, where the king is not &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;royal&lt;/dfn&gt;, and Grand Chess, where the rooks have significantly more opening mobility.\nIn a handicap game with rook odds, the player giving odds may castle with the absent rook, moving only the king.\nChess without castling.\nWriting in 2019, former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik proposed a variant of chess without castling. This variant would reduce king safety, theoretically leading to more dynamic games, as it would be considerably harder to force a draw and the pieces would be forced to engage in a m\u00eal\u00e9e. In 2021, former world champion Viswanathan Anand defeated Kramnik 2\u00bd\u20131\u00bd in a no-castling exhibition match under classical time controls.\nCastling in chess problems.\nCastling features in some chess problems. The earliest known study containing castling was published in 1843 by Julius Mendheim. \nRetrograde analysis.\nCastling is common in retrograde analysis problems. By chess problem convention, if a player's king and rook are on their original squares, the player is assumed to have castling rights unless it can be proved otherwise. In some retrograde analysis problems, the solver (who usually plays White) is required to prove that the opponent has previously moved their king or rook and therefore cannot castle. This is sometimes accomplished by castling or by capturing \"en passant\", thereby disproving other possible game histories.\nThe diagram shows a mate in two. 1.Rad1? 0-0 does not work. The &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;key&lt;/dfn&gt; is 1.0-0-0! This demonstrates that the white king has not moved yet and that the rook on d4 must therefore be a promoted piece. Therefore, either the black king or black rook has previously moved to let the white rook off the back rank. Therefore Black cannot castle. After any move by Black, 2.Rd8 is mate.\nNovelty problems.\nSome joke chess problems involve castling with a promoted rook of the opponent's color. In orthodox chess, this would be illegal since the rook would be giving check to the king, but under fairy chess conditions, this might not actually be check.\nThe diagrammed problem involves castling with an opposing rook under the Koko fairy condition (each piece must end up adjacent to another piece when moving). The solution (Black's move being given first per helpmate convention) is:\n1. Bg7 h8=R 2. Bf6 Kg6 3. 0-0 Kh7#\nwhere, after 3.0-0, White's rook is not checking the king; a hypothetical capture of the king would result in the rook not being adjacent to any other piece, which is illegal under the Koko condition.\nThe allowance of castling with a \"phantom rook\" in handicap games has also been used in joke problems. Many other joke variations on castling are possible.\nVertical castling.\nIn 1907, C. Staugaard composed a two-mover in which White promotes a pawn to a rook and then castles vertically with the newly promoted rook (placing the king on e3 and the rook on e2), since the rook has not moved. In the position on the right, White plays 1.e8=R, and after the forced move 1...Kxc2 castles vertically with the promoted rook, checkmating Black.\nVertical castling, also known as \"Staugaard castling\" or \"Pam\u2013Krabb\u00e9 castling\", has been used in a few novelty chess problems.\nTim Krabb\u00e9's 1985 book \"Chess Curiosities\" includes a problem featuring vertical castling, along with an incorrect claim that the problem's 1973 publication prompted FIDE to amend the castling laws in 1974 to add the requirement that the king and rook be on the same rank. In reality, the original FIDE Laws from 1930 explicitly stated that castling must be done with a king and a rook on the same rank (\"traverse\" in French). It is unclear whether any historically published sets of rules would technically allow such a move.\nNomenclature.\nIn most European languages, the term for castling is derived from the Persian word \"rukh\" (e.g. \"rochieren\", \"rochada\", \"enroque\"), while queenside and kingside castling are referred to using the adjectives meaning \"long\" and \"short\" (or \"big\" and \"small\"), respectively.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47643", "revid": "2842084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47643", "title": "Michel Foucault", "text": "French philosopher (1926\u20131984)\nPaul-Michel Foucault ( , ; ; 15 October 1926\u00a0\u2013 25 June 1984) was a French historian of ideas and philosopher, who was also an author, literary critic, political activist, and teacher. Foucault's theories primarily addressed the relationships between power versus knowledge and liberty, and he analyzed how they are used as a form of social control through multiple institutions. Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels and sought to critique authority without limits on himself. His thought has influenced academics within a large number of contrasting areas of study, with this especially including those working in anthropology, communication studies, criminology, cultural studies, feminism, literary theory, psychology, and sociology. His efforts against homophobia and racial prejudice as well as against other ideological doctrines have also shaped research into critical theory and Marxism\u2013Leninism alongside other topics.\nBorn in Poitiers, France, into an upper-middle-class family, Foucault was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV, at the , where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean Hyppolite and Louis Althusser, and at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology. After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, \"The History of Madness\" (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, he produced \"The Birth of the Clinic\" (1963) and \"The Order of Things\" (1966), publications that displayed his increasing involvement with structuralism, from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a historiographical technique Foucault was developing, which he called \"archaeology\".\nFrom 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the University of Tunis, before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of Paris VIII. Foucault subsequently published \"The Archaeology of Knowledge\" (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the Coll\u00e8ge de France, a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in several left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and other violations of human rights, focusing on struggles such as penal reform. Foucault later published \"Discipline and Punish\" (1975) and \"The History of Sexuality\" (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods that emphasized the role that power plays in society.\nFoucault died in Paris from complications of HIV/AIDS. He became the first public figure in France to die from complications of the disease, with his charisma and career influence changing mass awareness of the pandemic. This occurrence influenced HIV/AIDS activism; his partner, Daniel Defert, founded the AIDES charity in his memory. It continues to campaign as of 2024, despite the deaths of both Defert (in 2023) and Foucault (in 1984).\nEarly life.\nEarly years: 1926\u20131938.\nPaul-Michel Foucault was born on 15 October 1926 in the city of Poitiers, west-central France, as the second of three children in a prosperous, socially conservative, upper-middle-class family. Family tradition prescribed naming him after his father, Paul Foucault (1893\u20131959), but his mother insisted on the addition of Michel; referred to as Paul at school, he expressed a preference for \"Michel\" throughout his life.\nHis father, a successful local surgeon born in Fontainebleau, moved to Poitiers, where he set up his own practice. He married Anne Malapert, the daughter of prosperous surgeon Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the University of Poitiers' School of Medicine. Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law's medical practice, while Anne took charge of their large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of Vendeuvre-du-Poitou. Together the couple had three children\u2014a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys\u2014who all shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes. The children were raised to be nominal Catholics, attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchaire, and while Michel briefly became an altar boy, none of the family was devout.\nIn later life, Foucault revealed very little about his childhood. Describing himself as a \"juvenile delinquent\", he said his father was a \"bully\" who sternly punished him. In 1930, two years early, Foucault began his schooling at the local Lyc\u00e9e Henry-IV. There he undertook two years of elementary education before entering the main \"lyc\u00e9e\", where he stayed until 1936. Afterwards, he took his first four years of secondary education at the same establishment, excelling in French, Greek, Latin, and history, though doing poorly at mathematics, including arithmetic.\nTeens to young adulthood: 1939\u20131945.\nIn 1939, the Second World War began, followed by Nazi Germany's occupation of France in 1940. Foucault's parents opposed the occupation and the Vichy regime, but did not join the Resistance. That year, Foucault's mother enrolled him in the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Stanislas, a strict Catholic institution run by the Jesuits. Although he later described his years there as an \"ordeal\", Foucault excelled academically, particularly in philosophy, history, and literature. In 1942, he entered his final year, the \"terminale\", where he focused on the study of philosophy, earning his \"baccalaur\u00e9at\" in 1943.\nReturning to the local Lyc\u00e9e Henry-IV, he studied history and philosophy for a year, aided by a personal tutor, the philosopher Louis Girard. Rejecting his father's wishes that he become a surgeon, in 1945 Foucault went to Paris, where he enrolled in one of the country's most prestigious secondary schools, which was also known as the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV. Here he studied under the philosopher Jean Hyppolite, an existentialist and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Hyppolite had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the dialectical theories of Hegel and Karl Marx. These ideas influenced Foucault, who adopted Hyppolite's conviction that philosophy must develop through a study of history.\nUniversity studies: 1946\u20131951.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nIn autumn 1946, attaining excellent results, Foucault was admitted to the \u00e9lite (ENS), for which he undertook exams and an oral interrogation by Georges Canguilhem and Pierre-Maxime Schuhl to gain entry. Of the hundred students entering the ENS, Foucault ranked fourth based on his entry results, and encountered the highly competitive nature of the institution. Like most of his classmates, he lived in the school's communal dormitories on the Parisian Rue d'Ulm.\nHe remained largely unpopular, spending much time alone, reading voraciously. His fellow students noted his love of violence and the macabre; he decorated his bedroom with images of torture and war drawn during the Napoleonic Wars by Spanish artist Francisco Goya, and on one occasion chased a classmate with a dagger. Prone to self-harm, Foucault allegedly attempted suicide in 1948; his father sent him to see the psychiatrist Jean Delay at the Sainte-Anne Hospital Center. Obsessed with the idea of self-mutilation and suicide, Foucault attempted the latter several times in ensuing years, praising suicide in later writings. The ENS's doctor examined Foucault's state of mind, suggesting that his suicidal tendencies emerged from the distress surrounding his homosexuality, because same-sex sexual activity was socially taboo in France. At the time, Foucault engaged in homosexual activity with men whom he encountered in the underground Parisian gay scene, also indulging in drug use; according to biographer James Miller, he enjoyed the thrill and sense of danger that these activities offered him.\nAlthough studying various subjects, Foucault soon gravitated towards philosophy, reading not only Hegel and Marx but also Immanuel Kant, Edmund Husserl and most significantly, Martin Heidegger. He began reading the publications of philosopher Gaston Bachelard, taking a particular interest in his work exploring the history of science. He graduated from the ENS with a B.A. (licence) in Philosophy in 1948 and a \"Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures\" (\"DES\"), roughly equivalent to an M.A. degree) in Philosophy in 1949. His DES thesis under the direction of Hyppolite was titled \"La Constitution d'un transcendental dans La Ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologie de l'esprit de Hegel\" (\"The Constitution of a Historical Transcendental in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit\").\nIn 1948, the philosopher Louis Althusser became a tutor at the ENS. A Marxist, he influenced both Foucault and a number of other students, encouraging them to join the French Communist Party. Foucault did so in 1950, but never became particularly active in its activities, and never adopted an orthodox Marxist viewpoint, rejecting core Marxist tenets such as class struggle. He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the party's ranks; he personally faced homophobia and was appalled by the anti-semitism exhibited during the 1952\u201353 \"doctors' plot\" in the Soviet Union. He left the Communist Party in 1953, but remained Althusser's friend and defender for the rest of his life. Although failing at the first attempt in 1950, he passed his \"agr\u00e9gation\" in philosophy on the second try, in 1951. Excused from national service on medical grounds, he decided to start a doctorate at the Fondation Thiers in 1951, focusing on the philosophy of psychology, but he relinquished it after only one year in 1952.\nFoucault was also interested in psychology and he attended Daniel Lagache's lectures at the University of Paris, where he obtained a B.A. (licence) in psychology in 1949 and a \"Specialist Diploma in Psychopathology\" (\"Dipl\u00f4me de psychopathologie\") from the university's institute of psychology (now called the Institut de psychologie de l'universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes} in June 1952.\nEarly career (1951\u20131960).\nFrance: 1951\u20131955.\nOver the following few years, Foucault embarked on a variety of research and teaching jobs. From 1951 to 1955, he worked as a psychology instructor at the ENS at Althusser's invitation. In Paris, he shared a flat with his brother, who was training to become a surgeon, but for three days in the week commuted to the northern town of Lille, teaching psychology at the Universit\u00e9 de Lille from 1953 to 1954. Many of his students liked his lecturing style. Meanwhile, he continued working on his thesis, visiting the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale every day to read the work of psychologists such as Ivan Pavlov, Jean Piaget and Karl Jaspers. Undertaking research at the psychiatric institute of the Sainte-Anne Hospital, he became an unofficial intern, studying the relationship between doctor and patient and aiding experiments in the electroencephalographic laboratory. Foucault adopted many of the theories of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, undertaking psychoanalytical interpretation of his dreams and making friends undergo Rorschach tests.\nEmbracing the Parisian avant-garde, Foucault entered into a romantic relationship with the serialist composer Jean Barraqu\u00e9. Together, they tried to produce their greatest work, heavily used recreational drugs and engaged in sado-masochistic sexual activity. In August 1953, Foucault and Barraqu\u00e9 holidayed in Italy, where the philosopher immersed himself in \"Untimely Meditations\" (1873\u20131876), a set of four essays by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Later describing Nietzsche's work as \"a revelation\", he felt that reading the book deeply affected him, being a watershed moment in his life. Foucault subsequently experienced another groundbreaking self-revelation when watching a Parisian performance of Samuel Beckett's new play, \"Waiting for Godot\", in 1953.\nInterested in literature, Foucault was an avid reader of the philosopher Maurice Blanchot's book reviews published in \"Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise\". Enamoured of Blanchot's literary style and critical theories, in later works he adopted Blanchot's technique of \"interviewing\" himself. Foucault also came across Hermann Broch's 1945 novel \"The Death of Virgil\", a work that obsessed both him and Barraqu\u00e9. While the latter attempted to convert the work into an epic opera, Foucault admired Broch's text for its portrayal of death as an affirmation of life. The couple took a mutual interest in the work of such authors as the Marquis de Sade, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Franz Kafka and Jean Genet, all of whose works explored the themes of sex and violence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nInterested in the work of Swiss psychologist Ludwig Binswanger, Foucault aided family friend Jacqueline Verdeaux in translating his works into French. Foucault was particularly interested in Binswanger's studies of Ellen West who, like himself, had a deep obsession with suicide, eventually killing herself. In 1954, Foucault authored an introduction to Binswanger's paper \"Dream and Existence\", in which he argued that dreams constituted \"the birth of the world\" or \"the heart laid bare\", expressing the mind's deepest desires. That same year, Foucault published his first book, \"Maladie mentale et personalit\u00e9\" (\"Mental Illness and Personality\"), in which he exhibited his influence from both Marxist and Heideggerian thought, covering a wide range of subject matter from the reflex psychology of Pavlov to the classic psychoanalysis of Freud. Referencing the work of sociologists and anthropologists such as \u00c9mile Durkheim and Margaret Mead, he presented his theory that illness was culturally relative. Biographer James Miller noted that while the book exhibited \"erudition and evident intelligence\", it lacked the \"kind of fire and flair\" that Foucault exhibited in subsequent works. It was largely critically ignored, receiving only one review at the time. Foucault grew to despise it, unsuccessfully attempting to prevent its republication and translation into English.\nSweden, Poland, and West Germany: 1955\u20131960.\nFoucault spent the next five years abroad, first in Sweden, working as cultural diplomat at the University of Uppsala, a job obtained through his acquaintance with historian of religion Georges Dum\u00e9zil. At Uppsala, he was appointed a Reader in French language and literature, while simultaneously working as director of the Maison de France, thus opening the possibility of a cultural-diplomatic career. Although finding it difficult to adjust to the \"Nordic gloom\" and long winters, he developed close friendships with two Frenchmen, biochemist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Miquel and physicist Jacques Papet-L\u00e9pine, and entered into romantic and sexual relationships with various men. In Uppsala he became known for his heavy alcohol consumption and reckless driving in his new Jaguar car. In spring 1956, Barraqu\u00e9 broke from his relationship with Foucault, announcing that he wanted to leave the \"vertigo of madness\". In Uppsala, Foucault spent much of his spare time in the university's Carolina Rediviva library, making use of their Bibliotheca Walleriana collection of texts on the history of medicine for his ongoing research. Finishing his doctoral thesis, Foucault hoped that Uppsala University would accept it, but Sten Lindroth, a positivistic historian of science there, remained unimpressed, asserting that it was full of speculative generalisations and was a poor work of history; he refused to allow Foucault to be awarded a doctorate at Uppsala. In part because of this rejection, Foucault left Sweden. Later, Foucault admitted that the work was a first draft with certain lack of quality.\nAgain at Dum\u00e9zil's behest, in October 1958 Foucault arrived in Warsaw, the capital of the Polish People's Republic, and took charge of the University of Warsaw's Centre Fran\u00e7ais. Foucault found life in Poland difficult due to the lack of material goods and services following the destruction of the Second World War. Witnessing the aftermath of the Polish October of 1956, when students had protested against the governing communist Polish United Workers' Party, he felt that most Poles despised their government as a puppet regime of the Soviet Union, and thought that the system ran \"badly\". Considering the university a liberal enclave, he traveled the country giving lectures; proving popular, he adopted the position of \"de facto\" cultural attach\u00e9. Like France and Sweden, Poland legally tolerated but socially frowned on homosexual activity, and Foucault undertook relationships with a number of men; one was with a Polish security agent who hoped to trap Foucault in an embarrassing situation, which therefore would reflect badly on the French embassy. Wracked in diplomatic scandal, he was ordered to leave Poland for a new destination. Various positions were available in West Germany, and so Foucault relocated to the Institut fran\u00e7ais Hamburg (where he served as director in 1958\u20131960), teaching the same courses he had given in Uppsala and Warsaw. Spending much time in the Reeperbahn red-light district, he entered into a relationship with a transvestite.\nGrowing career (1960\u20131970).\n\"Madness and Civilization\": 1960.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nIn West Germany, Foucault completed in 1960 his primary thesis (\"th\u00e8se principale\") for his State doctorate, titled \"Folie et d\u00e9raison: Histoire de la folie \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge classique\" (trans. \"Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age\"), a philosophical work based upon his studies into the history of medicine. The book discussed how West European society had dealt with madness, arguing that it was a social construct distinct from mental illness. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the Renaissance, the later 17th and 18th centuries, and the modern experience. The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright Antonin Artaud, who exerted a strong influence over Foucault's thought at the time.\n\"Histoire de la folie\" was an expansive work, consisting of 943 pages of text, followed by appendices and a bibliography. Foucault submitted it at the University of Paris, although the university's regulations for awarding a State doctorate required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis. Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process. The first step was to obtain a \"rapporteur\", or \"sponsor\" for the work: Foucault chose Georges Canguilhem. The second was to find a publisher, and as a result \"Folie et d\u00e9raison\" was published in French in May 1961 by the company Plon, whom Foucault chose over Presses Universitaires de France after being rejected by Gallimard. In 1964, a heavily abridged version was published as a mass market paperback, then translated into English for publication the following year as \"Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason\".\n\"Folie et d\u00e9raison\" received a mixed reception in France and in foreign journals focusing on French affairs. Although it was critically acclaimed by Maurice Blanchot, Michel Serres, Roland Barthes, Gaston Bachelard, and Fernand Braudel, it was largely ignored by the leftist press, much to Foucault's disappointment. It was notably criticised for advocating metaphysics by young philosopher Jacques Derrida in a March 1963 lecture at the University of Paris. Responding with a vicious retort, Foucault criticised Derrida's interpretation of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. The two remained bitter rivals until reconciling in 1981. In the English-speaking world, the work became a significant influence on the anti-psychiatry movement during the 1960s; Foucault took a mixed approach to this, associating with a number of anti-psychiatrists but arguing that most of them misunderstood his work.\nFoucault's secondary thesis (), written in Hamburg between 1959 and 1960, was a translation and commentary on German philosopher Immanuel Kant's \"Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View\" (1798); the thesis was titled \"Introduction \u00e0 l'Anthropologie\". Largely consisting of Foucault's discussion of textual dating\u2014an \"archaeology of the Kantian text\"\u2014he rounded off the thesis with an evocation of Nietzsche, his biggest philosophical influence. This work's \"rapporteur\" was Foucault's old tutor and then-director of the ENS, Hyppolite, who was well acquainted with German philosophy. After both theses were championed and reviewed, he underwent his public defense of his doctoral thesis (\"soutenance de th\u00e8se\") on 20 May 1961. The academics responsible for reviewing his work were concerned about the unconventional nature of his major thesis; reviewer Henri Gouhier noted that it was not a conventional work of history, making sweeping generalisations without sufficient particular argument, and that Foucault clearly \"thinks in allegories\". They all agreed however that the overall project was of merit, awarding Foucault his doctorate \"despite reservations\".\nUniversity of Clermont-Ferrand, \"The Birth of the Clinic\", and \"The Order of Things\": 1960\u20131966.\nIn October 1960, Foucault took a tenured post in philosophy at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, commuting to the city every week from Paris, where he lived in a high-rise block on the rue du Dr Finlay. Responsible for teaching psychology, which was subsumed within the philosophy department, he was considered a \"fascinating\" but \"rather traditional\" teacher at Clermont. The department was run by Jules Vuillemin, who soon developed a friendship with Foucault. Foucault then took Vuillemin's job when the latter was elected to the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1962. In this position, Foucault took a dislike to another staff member whom he considered stupid: Roger Garaudy, a senior figure in the Communist Party. Foucault made life at the university difficult for Garaudy, leading the latter to transfer to Poitiers. Foucault also caused controversy by securing a university job for his lover, the philosopher Daniel Defert, with whom he retained a non-monogamous relationship for the rest of his life.\nFoucault maintained a keen interest in literature, publishing reviews in literary journals, including \"Tel Quel\" and \"Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise\", and sitting on the editorial board of \"Critique\", In May 1963, he published a book devoted to poet, novelist, and playwright Raymond Roussel. It was written in under two months, published by Gallimard, and was described by biographer David Macey as \"a very personal book\" that resulted from a \"love affair\" with Roussel's work. It was published in English in 1983 as \"Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel\". Receiving few reviews, it was largely ignored. That same year he published a sequel to \"Folie et d\u00e9raison\", titled \"Naissance de la Clinique\", subsequently translated as \"The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception\". Shorter than its predecessor, it focused on the changes that the medical establishment underwent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Like his preceding work, \"Naissance de la Clinique\" was largely critically ignored, but later gained a cult following. It was of interest within the field of medical ethics, as it considered the ways in which the history of medicine and hospitals, and the training that those working within them receive, bring about a particular way of looking at the body: the 'medical gaze'. Foucault was also selected to be among the \"Eighteen Man Commission\" that assembled between November 1963 and March 1964 to discuss university reforms that were to be implemented by Christian Fouchet, the Gaullist Minister of National Education. Implemented in 1967, they brought staff strikes and student protests.\nIn April 1966, Gallimard published Foucault's \"Les Mots et les choses\" (Words and Things), later translated as \"The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences\". Exploring how man came to be an object of knowledge, it argued that all periods of history have possessed certain underlying conditions of truth that constituted what was acceptable as scientific discourse. Foucault argues that these conditions of discourse have changed over time, from one period's \"\u00e9pist\u00e9m\u00e8\" to another. Although designed for a specialist audience, the work gained media attention, becoming a surprise bestseller in France. Appearing at the height of interest in structuralism, Foucault was quickly grouped with scholars such as Jacques Lacan, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, and Roland Barthes, as the latest wave of thinkers set to topple the existentialism popularized by Jean-Paul Sartre. Although initially accepting this description, Foucault soon vehemently rejected it, because he \"never posited a universal theory of discourse, but rather sought to describe the historical forms taken by discoursive practices\". Foucault and Sartre regularly criticised one another in the press. Both Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir attacked Foucault's ideas as \"bourgeois\", while Foucault retaliated against their Marxist beliefs by proclaiming that \"Marxism exists in nineteenth-century thought as a fish exists in water; that is, it ceases to breathe anywhere else.\"\nUniversity of Tunis and Vincennes: 1966\u20131970.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nIn September 1966, Foucault took a position teaching psychology at the University of Tunis in Tunisia. His decision to do so was largely because his lover, Defert, had been posted to the country as part of his national service. Foucault moved a few kilometres from Tunis, to the village of Sidi Bou Sa\u00efd, where fellow academic G\u00e9rard Deledalle lived with his wife. Soon after his arrival, Foucault announced that Tunisia was \"blessed by history\", a nation which \"deserves to live forever because it was where Hannibal and St. Augustine lived\". His lectures at the university proved very popular, and were well attended. Although many young students were enthusiastic about his teaching, they were critical of what they believed to be his right-wing political views, viewing him as a \"representative of Gaullist technocracy\", even though he considered himself a leftist.\nFoucault was in Tunis during the anti-government and pro-Palestinian riots that rocked the city in June 1967, and which continued for a year. Although highly critical of the violent, ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters, he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden, and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials, but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events. While in Tunis, Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Foucault started to write a book about the impressionist artist \u00c9douard Manet, but never completed it.\nIn 1968, Foucault returned to Paris, moving into an apartment on the Rue de Vaugirard. After the May 1968 student protests, Minister of Education Edgar Faure responded by founding new universities with greater autonomy. Most prominent of these was the Centre Exp\u00e9rimental de Vincennes in Vincennes on the outskirts of Paris. A group of prominent academics were asked to select teachers to run the centre's departments, and Canguilheim recommended Foucault as head of the Philosophy Department. Becoming a tenured professor of Vincennes, Foucault's desire was to obtain \"the best in French philosophy today\" for his department, employing Michel Serres, Judith Miller, Alain Badiou, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Fran\u00e7ois Regnault, Henri Weber, \u00c9tienne Balibar, and Fran\u00e7ois Ch\u00e2telet; most of them were Marxists or ultra-left activists.\nLectures began at the university in January 1969, and straight away its students and staff, including Foucault, were involved in occupations and clashes with police, resulting in arrests. In February, Foucault gave a speech denouncing police provocation to protesters at the Maison de la Mutualit\u00e9. Such actions marked Foucault's embrace of the ultra-left, undoubtedly influenced by Defert, who had gained a job at Vincennes' sociology department and who had become a Maoist. Most of the courses at Foucault's philosophy department were Marxist\u2013Leninist oriented, although Foucault himself gave courses on Nietzsche, \"The end of Metaphysics\", and \"The Discourse of Sexuality\", which were highly popular and over-subscribed. While the right-wing press was heavily critical of this new institution, new Minister of Education Olivier Guichard was angered by its ideological bent and the lack of exams, with students being awarded degrees in a haphazard manner. He refused national accreditation of the department's degrees, resulting in a public rebuttal from Foucault.\nLater life (1970\u20131984).\nColl\u00e8ge de France and \"Discipline and Punish\": 1970\u20131975.\nFoucault desired to leave Vincennes and become a fellow of the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge de France. He requested to join, taking up a chair in what he called the \"history of systems of thought\", and his request was championed by members Dum\u00e9zil, Hyppolite, and Vuillemin. In November 1969, when an opening became available, Foucault was elected to the Coll\u00e8ge, though with opposition by a large minority. He gave his inaugural lecture in December 1970, which was subsequently published as \"L'Ordre du discours\" (\"The Discourse of Language\"). He was obliged to give 12 weekly lectures a year\u2014and did so for the rest of his life\u2014covering the topics that he was researching at the time; these became \"one of the events of Parisian intellectual life\" and were repeatedly packed out events. On Mondays, he also gave seminars to a group of students; many of them became a \"Foulcauldian tribe\" who worked with him on his research. He enjoyed this teamwork and collective research, and together they published a number of short books. Working at the Coll\u00e8ge allowed him to travel widely, giving lectures in Brazil, Japan, Canada, and the United States over the next 14 years. In 1970 and 1972, Foucault served as a professor in the French Department of the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York.\nIn May 1971, Foucault co-founded the Groupe d'Information sur les Prisons (GIP) along with historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet and journalist Jean-Marie Domenach. The GIP aimed to investigate and expose poor conditions in prisons and give prisoners and ex-prisoners a voice in French society. It was highly critical of the penal system, believing that it converted petty criminals into hardened delinquents. The GIP gave press conferences and staged protests surrounding the events of the Toul prison riot in December 1971, alongside other prison riots that it sparked off; in doing so it faced a police crackdown and repeated arrests. The group became active across France, with 2,000 to 3,000, members, but disbanded before 1974. Also campaigning against the death penalty, Foucault co-authored a short book on the case of the convicted murderer Pierre Rivi\u00e8re. After his research into the penal system, Foucault published \"Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison\" (\"Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison\") in 1975, offering a history of the system in western Europe. In it, Foucault examines the penal evolution away from corporal and capital punishment to the penitentiary system that began in Europe and the United States around the end of the 18th century. Biographer Didier Eribon described it as \"perhaps the finest\" of Foucault's works, and it was well received.\nFoucault was also active in anti-racist campaigns; in November 1971, he was a leading figure in protests following the perceived racist killing of Arab migrant Djellali Ben Ali. In this he worked alongside his old rival Sartre, the journalist Claude Mauriac, and one of his literary heroes, Jean Genet. This campaign was formalised as the Committee for the Defence of the Rights of Immigrants, but there was tension at their meetings as Foucault opposed the anti-Israeli sentiment of many Arab workers and Maoist activists. At a December 1972 protest against the police killing of Algerian worker Mohammad Diab, both Foucault and Genet were arrested, resulting in widespread publicity. Foucault was also involved in founding the Agence de Press-Lib\u00e9ration (APL), a group of leftist journalists who intended to cover news stories neglected by the mainstream press. In 1973, they established the daily newspaper \"Lib\u00e9ration\", and Foucault suggested that they establish committees across France to collect news and distribute the paper, and advocated a column known as the \"Chronicle of the Workers' Memory\" to allow workers to express their opinions. Foucault wanted an active journalistic role in the paper, but this proved untenable, and he soon became disillusioned with \"Lib\u00e9ration\", believing that it distorted the facts; he did not publish in it until 1980.\nIn 1975 he had an LSD experience with Simeon Wade&lt;ref name=\"dundas/foucault-calif\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Stoneman&lt;ref name=\"salon/Dean/Foucault-LSD\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"legacy/17757954\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in Death Valley, California, and later wrote \"it was the greatest experience of his life, and that it profoundly changed his life and his work\". In front of Zabriskie Point they took LSD while listening to a well-prepared music program: Richard Strauss's \"Four Last Songs\", followed by Charles Ives's \"Three Places in New England\", ending with a few avant-garde pieces by Stockhausen. According to Wade, as soon as he came back to Paris, Foucault scrapped the second \"The History of Sexuality\"'s manuscript, and totally rethought the whole project.\n\"The History of Sexuality\" and Iranian Revolution: 1976\u20131979.\nIn 1976, Gallimard published Foucault's \"Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9: la volont\u00e9 de savoir\" (\"The History of Sexuality: The Will to Knowledge\"), a short book exploring what Foucault called the \"repressive hypothesis\". It revolved largely around the concept of power, rejecting both Marxist and Freudian theory. Foucault intended it as the first in a seven-volume exploration of the subject. \"Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9\" was a best-seller in France and gained positive press, but lukewarm intellectual interest, something that upset Foucault, who felt that many misunderstood his hypothesis. He soon became dissatisfied with Gallimard after being offended by senior staff member Pierre Nora. Along with Paul Veyne and Fran\u00e7ois Wahl, Foucault launched a new series of academic books, known as \"Des travaux\" (\"Some Works\"), through the company Seuil, which he hoped would improve the state of academic research in France. He also produced introductions for the memoirs of Herculine Barbin and \"My Secret Life\".\nFoucault's \"Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9\" concentrates on the relation between truth and sex. He defines truth as a system of ordered procedures for the production, distribution, regulation, circulation, and operation of statements. Through this system of truth, power structures are created and enforced. Though Foucault's definition of truth may differ from other sociologists before and after him, his work with truth in relation to power structures, such as sexuality, has left a profound mark on social science theory. In his work, he examines the heightened curiosity regarding sexuality that induced a \"world of perversion\" during the elite, capitalist 18th and 19th century in the western world. According to Foucault in \"History of Sexuality\", society of the modern age is symbolized by the conception of sexual discourses and their union with the system of truth. In the \"world of perversion\", including extramarital affairs, homosexual behavior, and other such sexual promiscuities, Foucault concludes that sexual relations of the kind are constructed around producing the truth. Sex became not only a means of pleasure, but an issue of truth. Sex is what confines one to darkness, but also what brings one to light.\nSimilarly, in \"The History of Sexuality\", society validates and approves people based on how closely they fit the discursive mold of sexual truth. As Foucault reminds us, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Church was the epitome of power structure within society. Thus, many aligned their personal virtues with those of the Church, further internalizing their beliefs on the meaning of sex. However, those who unify their sexual relation to the truth become decreasingly obliged to share their internal views with those of the Church. They will no longer see the arrangement of societal norms as an effect of the Church's deep-seated power structure.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nFoucault remained a political activist, focusing on protesting government abuses of human rights around the world. He was a key player in the 1975 protests against the Spanish government who were set to execute 11 militants sentenced to death without fair trial. It was his idea to travel to Madrid with six others to give a press conference there; they were subsequently arrested and deported back to Paris. In 1977, he protested the extradition of Klaus Croissant to West Germany, and his rib was fractured during clashes with riot police. In July that year, he organised an assembly of Eastern Bloc dissidents to mark the visit of Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev to Paris. In 1979, he campaigned for Vietnamese political dissidents to be granted asylum in France.\nIn 1977, Italian newspaper \"Corriere della sera\" asked Foucault to write a column for them. In doing so, in 1978 he travelled to Tehran in Iran, days after the Black Friday massacre. Documenting the developing Iranian Revolution, he met with opposition leaders such as Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari and Mehdi Bazargan, and discovered the popular support for Islamism. Returning to France, he was one of the journalists who visited the Ayatollah Khomeini, before visiting Tehran. His articles expressed awe of Khomeini's Islamist movement, for which he was widely criticised in the French press, including by Iranian expatriates. Foucault's response was that Islamism was to become a major political force in the region, and that the West must treat it with respect rather than hostility. In April 1978, Foucault traveled to Japan, where he studied Zen Buddhism under Omori Sogen at the Seionji temple in Uenohara.\nFinal years: 1980\u20131984.\nAlthough remaining critical of power relations, Foucault expressed cautious support for the Socialist Party government of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand following its electoral victory in 1981. But his support soon deteriorated when that party refused to condemn the Polish government's crackdown on the 1982 demonstrations in Poland orchestrated by the Solidarity trade union. He and sociologist Pierre Bourdieu authored a document condemning Mitterrand's inaction that was published in \"Lib\u00e9ration\", and they also took part in large public protests on the issue. Foucault continued to support Solidarity, and with his friend Simone Signoret traveled to Poland as part of a M\u00e9decins du Monde expedition, taking time out to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp. He continued his academic research, and in June 1984 Gallimard published the second and third volumes of \"Histoire de la sexualit\u00e9\". Volume two, \"L'Usage des plaisirs\", dealt with the \"techniques of self\" prescribed by ancient Greek pagan morality in relation to sexual ethics, while volume three, \"Le Souci de soi\", explored the same theme in the Greek and Latin texts of the first two centuries CE. A fourth volume, \"Les Aveux de la chair\", was to examine sexuality in early Christianity, but it was not finished.\nIn October 1980, Foucault became a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, giving the Howison Lectures on \"Truth and Subjectivity\", while in November he lectured at the Humanities Institute at New York University. His growing popularity in American intellectual circles was noted by \"Time\" magazine, while Foucault went on to lecture at University of California, Los Angeles in 1981, the University of Vermont in 1982, and Berkeley again in 1983, where his lectures drew huge crowds. Foucault spent many evenings in the San Francisco gay scene, frequenting sado-masochistic bathhouses, engaging in unprotected sex. He praised sado-masochistic activity in interviews with the gay press, describing it as \"the real creation of new possibilities of pleasure, which people had no idea about previously\". Foucault contracted HIV and eventually developed AIDS. Little was known of the virus at the time; the first cases had only been identified in 1980. Foucault initially referred to AIDS as a \"dreamed-up disease\". In summer 1983, he developed a persistent dry cough, which concerned friends in Paris, but Foucault insisted it was just a pulmonary infection. Only when hospitalized was Foucault correctly diagnosed as being HIV-positive; treated with antibiotics, he delivered a final set of lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. Foucault entered Paris' H\u00f4pital de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re\u2014the same institution that he had studied in \"Madness and Civilisation\"\u2014on 10 June 1984, with neurological symptoms complicated by sepsis. He died in the hospital on 25 June.\nDeath.\nOn 26 June 1984, announced Foucault's death, mentioning the rumour that it had been brought on by AIDS. The following day, issued a medical bulletin cleared by his family that made no reference to HIV/AIDS. On 29 June, Foucault's ceremony was held, in which the coffin was carried from the hospital morgue. Hundreds attended, including activists and academic friends, while Gilles Deleuze gave a speech using excerpts from \"The History of Sexuality\". His body was then buried at Vendeuvre-du-Poitou in a small ceremony. Soon after his death, Foucault's partner Daniel Defert founded the first national HIV/AIDS organisation in France, AIDES; a play on the French word for \"help\" () and the English-language acronym for the disease. On the second anniversary of Foucault's death, Defert publicly revealed in \"The Advocate\" that Foucault's death was AIDS-related.\nPersonal life.\nFoucault's first biographer, Didier Eribon, described the philosopher as \"a complex, many-sided character\", and that \"under one mask there is always another\". He also noted that he exhibited an \"enormous capacity for work\". At the ENS, Foucault's classmates unanimously summed him up as a figure who was both \"disconcerting and strange\" and \"a passionate worker\". As he aged, his personality changed: Eribon noted that while he was a \"tortured adolescent\", post-1960, he had become \"a radiant man, relaxed and cheerful\", even being described by those who worked with him as a dandy. He noted that in 1969, Foucault embodied the idea of \"the militant intellectual\".\nFoucault was an atheist. He loved classical music, particularly enjoying the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and became known for wearing turtleneck sweaters. After his death, Foucault's friend Georges Dum\u00e9zil described him as having possessed \"a profound kindness and goodness\", also exhibiting an \"intelligence [that] literally knew no bounds\". His life-partner Daniel Defert inherited his estate, whose archive was sold in 2012 to the National Library of France for \u20ac3.8 million ($4.5 million in April 2021).\nPolitics.\nPolitically, Foucault was a leftist throughout much of his life, though his particular stance within the left often changed. In the early 1950s, while never adopting an orthodox Marxist viewpoint, Foucault had been a member of the French Communist Party, leaving the party after three years as he expressed disgust in the prejudice within its ranks against Jews and homosexuals. After spending some time working in Poland, he became further disillusioned with communist ideology. As a result, in the early 1960s, Foucault was considered to be \"violently anticommunist\" by some of his detractors, even though he was involved in leftist campaigns along with most of his students and colleagues.\nPhilosophical work.\nFoucault's colleague Pierre Bourdieu summarized the philosopher's thought as \"a long exploration of transgression, of going beyond social limits, always inseparably linked to knowledge and power\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nPhilosopher Philip Stokes of the University of Reading noted that overall, Foucault's work was \"dark and pessimistic\". Though it does, however, leave some room for optimism, in that it illustrates how the discipline of philosophy can be used to highlight areas of domination. In doing so, as Stokes claimed, the ways in which we are being dominated become better understood, so that we may strive to build social structures that minimise this risk of domination. In all of this development there had to be close attention to detail; it is the detail which eventually individualizes people.\nLater in his life, Foucault explained that his work was less about analyzing power as a phenomenon than about trying to characterize the different ways in which contemporary society has expressed the use of power to \"objectivise subjects\". These have taken three broad forms: one involving scientific authority to classify and 'order' knowledge about human populations; the second has been to categorize and 'normalise' human subjects (by identifying madness, illness, physical features, and so on); and the third relates to the manner in which the impulse to fashion sexual identities and train one's own body to engage in routines and practices ends up reproducing certain patterns within a given society.\nLiterature.\nIn addition to his philosophical work, Foucault also wrote on literature. \"Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel\", published in 1963 and translated in English in 1986, is Foucault's only book-length work on literature. He described it as \"by far the book I wrote most easily, with the greatest pleasure, and most rapidly\". Foucault explores theory, criticism, and psychology with reference to the texts of Raymond Roussel, one of the first notable experimental writers. Foucault also gave a lecture responding to Roland Barthes' famous essay \"The Death of the Author\" titled \"What Is an Author?\" in 1969, later published in full. According to literary theoretician Kornelije Kvas, for Foucault, \"denying the existence of a historical author on account of his/her irrelevance for interpretation is absurd, for the author is a function of the text that organizes its sense\".\nPower.\nFoucault's analysis of power comes in two forms: empirical and theoretical. The empirical analyses concern themselves with historical (and modern) forms of power and how these emerged from previous forms of power. Foucault describes three types of power in his empirical analyses: \"sovereign\" power, \"disciplinary\" power, and \"biopower\".\nFoucault is generally critical of \"theories\" that try to give absolute answers to \"everything\". Therefore, he considered his own \"theory\" of power to be closer to a method than a typical \"theory\". According to Foucault, most people misunderstand power. For this reason, he makes clear that power cannot be completely described as:\nFoucault is not critical of considering these phenomena as \"power\", but claims that these theories of power cannot completely describe \"all\" forms of power. Foucault also claims that a liberal definition of power has effectively hidden other forms of power to the extent that people have uncritically accepted them.\nFoucault's power analysis begins on micro-level, with singular \"force relations\". Richard A. Lynch defines Foucault's concept of \"force relation\" as \"whatever in one's social interactions that pushes, urges or compels one to do something\". According to Foucault, force relations are an effect of difference, inequality or unbalance that exists in other forms of relationships (such as sexual or economic). Force, and power, is however not something that a person or group \"holds\" (such as in the sovereign definition of power), instead power is a complex group of forces that comes from \"everything\" and therefore exists everywhere. That relations of power always result from inequality, difference or unbalance also means that power always has a goal or purpose. Power comes in two forms: tactics and strategies. Tactics is power on the micro-level, which can for example be how a person chooses to express themselves through their clothes. Strategies on the other hand, is power on macro-level, which can be the state of fashion at any moment. Strategies consist of a combination of tactics. At the same time, power is non-subjective according to Foucault. This posits a paradox, according to Lynch, since \"someone\" has to exert power, while at the same time there can be no \"someone\" exerting this power. According to Lynch this paradox can be solved with two observations:\nAccording to Foucault, force relations are constantly changing, constantly interacting with other force relations which may weaken, strengthen or change one another. Foucault writes that power always includes resistance, which means there is always a possibility that power and force relations will change in some way. According to Richard A. Lynch, the purpose of Foucault's work on power is to increase peoples' awareness of how power has shaped their way of being, thinking and acting, and by increasing this awareness making it possible for them to change their way of being, thinking and acting.\nSovereign power.\nWith \"sovereign power\" Foucault alludes to a power structure that is similar to a pyramid, where one person or a group of people (at the top of the pyramid) holds the power, while the \"normal\" (and oppressed) people are at the bottom of the pyramid. In the middle parts of the pyramid are the people who enforce the sovereign's orders. A typical example of sovereign power is absolute monarchy.\nIn historical absolute monarchies, crimes had been considered a personal offense against the sovereign and his/her power. The punishment was often public and spectacular, partly to deter others from committing crimes, but also to reinstate the sovereign's power. This was however both expensive and ineffective\u2014it led far too often to people sympathizing with the criminal. In modern times, when disciplinary power is dominant, criminals are instead subjected to various disciplinary techniques to \"remold\" the criminal into a \"law abiding citizen\".\nAccording to Chlo\u00eb Taylor, a characteristic for sovereign power is that the sovereign has the right to take life, wealth, services, labor and products. The sovereign has a right to subtract\u2014to take life, to enslave life, etc.\u2014but not the right to control life in the way that later happens in disciplinary systems of power. According to Taylor, the form of power that the philosopher Thomas Hobbes is concerned about, is sovereign power. According to Hobbes, people are \"free\" so long they are not literally placed in chains.\nDisciplinary power.\nWhat Foucault calls \"disciplinary power\" aims to use bodies' skills as effectively as possible. The more useful the body becomes, the more obedient it also has to become. The purpose of this is not only to use the bodies' skills, but also prevent these skills from being used to revolt against the power.\nDisciplinary power has \"individuals\" as its object, target and instrument. According to Foucault, \"individual\" is however a construct created by disciplinary power. The disciplinary power's techniques create a \"rational self-control\", which in practice means that the disciplinary power is internalized and therefore doesn't continuously need external force. Foucault says that disciplinary power is primarily not an oppressing form of power, but rather so a productive form of power. Disciplinary power doesn't oppress interests or desires, but instead subjects bodies to reconstructed patterns of behavior to reconstruct their thoughts, desires and interests. According to Foucault this happens in factories, schools, hospitals and prisons. Disciplinary power creates a certain type of individual by producing new movements, habits and skills. It focuses on details, single movements, their timing and speed. It organizes bodies in time and space, and controls every movement for maximal effect. It uses rules, surveillance, exams and controls. The activities follow certain plans, whose purpose it is to lead the bodies to certain pre-determined goals. The bodies are also combined with each other, to reach a productivity that is greater than the sum of all bodies activities.\nDisciplinary power has according to Foucault been especially successful due to its usage of three technologies: hierarchical observation, normalizing judgement and exams. By hierarchical observation, the bodies become constantly visible to the power. The observation is hierarchical since there is not a single observer, but rather so a \"hierarchy\" of observers. An example of this is mental asylums during the 19th century, when the psychiatrist was not the only observer, but also nurses and auxiliary staff. From these observations and scientific discourses, a norm is established and used to judge the observed bodies. For the disciplinary power to continue to exist, this judgement has to be normalized. Foucault mentions several characteristics of this judgement: (1) all deviations, even small ones, from correct behavior are punished, (2) repeated rule violations are punished extra, (3) exercises are used as a behavior correcting technique and punishment, (4) rewards are used together with punishment to establish a hierarchy of good and bad behavior/people, (5) rank/grades/etc. are used as punishment and reward. Examinations combine the hierarchical observation with judgement. Exams objectify and individualize the observed bodies by creating extensive documentation about every observed body. The purpose of the exams is therefore to gather further information about each individual, track their development and compare their results to the norm.\nAccording to Foucault, the \"formula\" for disciplinary power can be seen in philosopher Jeremy Bentham's plan for the \"optimal prison\": the panopticon. Such a prison consists of a circle-formed building where every cell is inhabited by only one prisoner. In every cell there are two windows\u2014one to let in light from outside and one pointing to the middle of the circle-formed building. In this middle there is a tower where a guard can be placed to observe the prisoners. Since the prisoners will never be able to know whether they are being watched or not at a given moment, they will internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior (\"as if\" they were constantly being watched). Foucault says this construction (1) creates an individuality by separating prisoners from each other in the physical room, (2) since the prisoners cannot know if they are being watched at any given moment, they internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior as if they were always watched, (3) the surveillance makes it possible to create extensive documentation about each prisoner and their behavior. According to Foucault the panopticon has been used as a model also for other disciplinary institutions, such as mental asylums in the 19th century.\nBiopower.\nWith \"biopower\" Foucault refers to power over \"bios\" (life)\u2014power over populations. Biopower primarily rests on norms which are internalized by people, rather than external force. It encourages, strengthens, controls, observes, optimizes and organize the forces below it. Foucault has sometimes described biopower as separate from disciplinary power, but at other times he has described disciplinary power as an expression of biopower. Biopower can use disciplinary techniques, but in contrast to disciplinary power its target is populations rather than individuals.\nBiopower studies populations regarding (for example) number of births, life expectancy, public health, housing, migration, crime, which social groups are over-represented in deviations from the norm (regarding health, crime, etc.) and tries to adjust, control or eliminate these norm deviations. One example is the age distribution in a population. Biopower is interested in age distribution to compensate for future (or current) lacks of labor power, retirement homes, etc. Yet another example is sex: because sex is connected to population growth, sex and sexuality have been of great interest to biopower. On a disciplinary level, people who engaged in non-reproductive sexual acts have been treated for psychiatric diagnoses such as \"perversion\", \"frigidity\" and \"sexual dysfunction\". On a biopower-level, the usage of contraceptives has been studied, some social groups have (by various means) been encouraged to have children, while others (such as poor, sick, unmarried women, criminals or people with disabilities) have been discouraged or prevented from having children.\nIn the era of biopower, death has become a scandal and a catastrophe, but despite this biopower has according to Foucault killed more people than any other form of power has ever done before it. Under sovereign power, the sovereign king could kill people to exert his power or start wars simply to extend his kingdom, but during the era of biopower wars have instead been motivated by an ambition to \"protect life itself\". Similar motivations has also been used for genocide. For example, Nazi Germany motivated its attempt to eradicate Jews, the mentally ill and disabled with the motivation that Jews were \"a threat to the German health\", and that the money spent on healthcare for mentally ill and disabled people would be better spent on \"viable Germans\". Chlo\u00eb Taylor also mentions the Iraq War was motivated by similar tenets. The motivation was at first that Iraq was thought to have weapons of mass destruction and connections to Al-Qaeda. However, when the Bush and Blair administrations did not find any evidence to support either of these theories, the motivation for the war was changed. In the new motivation, the cause of the war was said to be that Saddam Hussein had committed crimes against his own population. Taylor means that in modern times, war has to be \"concealed\" under a rhetoric of humanitarian aid, despite the fact that these wars often cause humanitarian crises.\nDuring the 19th century, slums were increasing in number and size across the western world. Criminality, illness, alcoholism and prostitution was common in these areas, and the middle class considered the people who lived in these slums as \"unmoral\" and \"lazy\". The middle class also feared that this underclass sooner or later would \"take over\" because the population growth was greater in these slums than it was in the middle class. This fear gave rise to the scientific study of eugenics, whose founder Francis Galton had been inspired by Charles Darwin and his theory of natural selection. According to Galton, society was preventing natural selection by helping \"the weak\", thus causing a spread of the \"negative qualities\" into the rest of the population.\nThe body and sexuality.\nAccording to Foucault, the body is not something objective that stands outside history and culture. Instead, Foucault argues, the body has been and is continuously shaped by society and history\u2014by work, diet, body ideals, exercise, medical interventions, etc. Foucault presents no \"theory\" of the body, but does write about it in \"Discipline and Punish\" as well as in \"The History of Sexuality\". Foucault was critical of all purely biological explanations of phenomena such as sexuality, madness and criminality. Further, Foucault argues, that the body is not sufficient as a basis for self-understanding and understanding of others.\nIn \"Discipline and Punish\", Foucault shows how power and the body are tied together, for example by the disciplinary power primarily focusing on individual bodies and their behavior. Foucault argues that power, by manipulating bodies/behavior, also manipulates people's minds. Foucault turns the platonic saying \"the body is the prison of the soul\" (\"Phaedo\", 66a\u201367d) and instead posits that \"the soul is the prison of the body\".\nAccording to Foucault, sexology has tried to exert itself as a \"science\" by referring to the material (the body). In contrast to this, Foucault argues that sexology is a pseudoscience, and that \"sex\" is a pseudo-scientific idea. For Foucault the idea of a natural, biologically grounded and fundamental sexuality is a normative historical construct that has also been used as an instrument of power. By describing sex as the biological and fundamental cause to peoples' gender identity, sexual identity and sexual behavior, power has effectively been able to normalize sexual and gendered behavior. This has made it possible to evaluate, pathologize and \"correct\" peoples' sexual and gendered behavior, by comparing bodies behaviors to the constructed \"normal\" behavior. For Foucault, a \"normal sexuality\" is as much of a construct as a \"natural sexuality\". Therefore, Foucault was also critical of the popular discourse that dominated the debate over sexuality during the 1960s and 1970s. During this time, the popular discourse argued for a \"liberation\" of sexuality from a cultural, moral and capitalistic oppression. Foucault, however, argues that peoples' opinions about and experiences of sexuality are \"always\" a result of cultural and power mechanisms. To \"liberate\" sexuality from one group of norms only means that another group of norms takes its place. This, however, does not mean that Foucault considers resistance to be futile. What Foucault argues for is rather that it is impossible to become completely free from power, and that there is simply no \"natural\" sexuality. Power always involves a dimension of resistance, and therefore also a possibility for change. Although Foucault considers it impossible to step outside of power-networks, it is always possible to change these networks or navigate them differently.\nAccording to Foucault, the body is not only an \"obedient and passive object\" that is dominated by discourses and power. The body is also the \"seed\" to resistance against dominant discourses and power techniques. The body is never fully compliant, and experiences can never fully be reduced to linguistic descriptions. There is always a possibility to experience something that is not possible to describe with words, and in this discrepancy there is also a possibility for resistance against dominant discourses.\nFoucault's view of the historical construction of the body has influenced many feminist and queer-theorists. According to Johanna Oksala, Foucault's influence on queer theory has been so great than he can be considered one of the founders of queer theory. The fundamental idea behind queer theory is that there is no natural fundament that lies behind identities such as gay, lesbian, heterosexual, etc. Instead these identities are considered cultural constructions that have been constructed through normative discourses and relations of power. Feminists have with the help of Foucault's ideas studied different ways that women form their bodies: through plastic surgery, diet, eating disorders, etc. Foucault's historization of sex has also affected feminist theorists such as Judith Butler, who used Foucault's theories about the relation between subject, power and sex to question gendered subjects. Butler follows Foucault by saying that there is no \"true\" gender behind gender identity that constitutes its biological and objective fundament. However, Butler is critical of Foucault, arguing that Foucault \"naively\" presents bodies and pleasures as a ground for resistance against power without extending his historization of sexuality to gendered subjects/bodies. Foucault has received criticism from other feminists, such as Susan Bordo and Kate Soper.\nJohanna Oksala argues that Foucault, by saying that sex/sexuality are constructed, doesn't deny the existence of sexuality. Oksala also argues that the goal of critical theories such as Foucault's is not to liberate the body and sexuality from oppression, but rather to question and deny the identities that are posited as \"natural\" and \"essential\" by showing how these identities are historical and cultural constructions.\nIn May 1977, Foucault signed a petition to the French parliament, calling for the lowering of the homosexual age of consent from 21 to 15 to match with the heterosexual one. In a 1978 broadcast, Foucault argued that children could give sexual consent, saying that \"to assume that a child is incapable of explaining what happened and was incapable of giving his consent are two abuses that are intolerable, quite unacceptable.\"\nSubjectivity.\nFoucault considered his primary project to be the investigation of how people through history have been made into \"subjects\". Subjectivity, for Foucault, is not a state of being, but a practice\u2014an active \"being\". According to Foucault, \"the subject\" has, by western philosophers, usually been considered as something given; natural and objective. On the contrary, Foucault considers subjectivity to be a construction created by power. Foucault talks of \"assujettissement\", which is a French term that for Foucault refers to a process where power creates subjects while also oppressing them using social norms. For Foucault \"social norms\" are standards that people are encouraged to follow, that are also used to compare and define people. As an example of \"assujettissement\", Foucault mentions \"homosexual\", a historically contingent type of subjectivity that was created by sexology. Foucault writes that sodomy was previously considered a serious sexual deviation, but a temporary one. Homosexuality, however, became a \"species\", a past, a childhood and a type of life. \"Homosexuals\" have by the same power that created this subjectivity been discriminated against, due to homosexuality being considered as a deviation from the \"normal\" sexuality. However, Foucault argues, the creation of a subjectivity such as \"homosexuality\" does not only have negative consequences for the people who are subjectivised\u2014subjectivity of homosexuality has also led to the creation of gay bars and the pride parade.\nAccording to Foucault, scientific discourses have played an important role in the disciplinary power system, by classifying and categorizing people, observing their behavior and \"treating\" them when their behavior has been considered \"abnormal\". He defines discourse as a form of oppression that does not require physical force. He identifies its production as \"controlled, selected, organized and redistributed by a certain number of procedures\", which are driven by individuals' aspiration of knowledge to create \"rules\" and \"systems\" that translate into social codes. Moreover, discourse creates a force that extends beyond societal institutions and could be found in social and formal fields such as health care systems, education and law enforcement. The formation of these fields may seem to contribute to social development; however, Foucault warns against discourses' harmful aspects on society.\nSciences such as psychiatry, biology, medicine, economics, psychoanalysis, psychology, sociology, ethnology, pedagogy and criminology have all categorized behaviors as rational, irrational, normal, abnormal, human, inhuman, etc. By doing so, they have all created various types of subjectivity and norms, which are then internalized by people as \"truths\". People have then adapted their behavior to get closer to what these sciences has labeled as \"normal\". For example, Foucault claims that psychological observation/surveillance and psychological discourses have created a type of psychology-centered subjectivity, which has led to people considering unhappiness a fault in their psychology rather than in society. This has also, according to Foucault, been a way for society to resist criticism\u2014criticism against society has been turned against the individual and their psychological health.\nSelf-constituting subjectivity.\nAccording to Foucault, subjectivity is not necessarily something that is forced upon people externally\u2014it is also something that is established in a person's relation to themselves. This can, for example, happen when a person is trying to \"find themselves\" or \"be themselves\", something Edward McGushin describes as a typical modern activity. In this quest for the \"true self\", the self is established in two levels: as a passive object (the \"true self\" that is searched for) and as an active \"searcher\". The ancient Cynics and the 19th-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche posited that the \"true self\" can only be found by going through great hardship and/or danger. The ancient Stoics and 17th-century philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, however, argued that the \"self\" can be found by quiet and solitary introspection. Yet another example is Socrates, who argued that self-awareness can only be found by having debates with others, where the debaters question each other's foundational views and opinions. Foucault, however, argued that \"subjectivity\" is a process, rather than a state of being. As such, Foucault argued that there is no \"true self\" to be found. Rather so, the \"self\" is constituted/created in activities such as the ones employed to \"find\" the \"self\". In other words, exposing oneself to hardships and danger does not \"reveal\" the \"true self\", according to Foucault, but rather creates a particular type of self and subjectivity. However, according to Foucault the \"form\" for the subject is in great part already constituted by power, before these self-constituting practices are employed. Schools, workplaces, households, government institutions, entertainment media and the healthcare sector all, through disciplinary power, contribute to forming people into being particular types of subjects.\nFreedom.\nTodd May defines Foucault's concept of freedom as: that which we can do of ourselves within our specific historical context. A condition for this, according to Foucault, is that we are aware of our situation and how it has been created/affected (and is still being affected) by power. According to May, two of the aspects of how power has shaped peoples' way of being, thinking and acting are described in the books where Foucault deals with disciplinary power and the history of sexuality. However, May argues, there will always be aspects of peoples' formation that will be unknown to them, hence the constant necessity for the type of analyses that Foucault did.\nFoucault argues that the forces that have affected people can be changed; people always have the capacity to change the factors that limit their freedom. Freedom is thus not a state of being, but a practice\u2014a way of being in relation to oneself, to others and to the world. According to Todd May, Foucault's concept of freedom also includes constructing histories like the ones Foucault did about the history of disciplinary power and sexuality\u2014histories that investigate and describe the forces that have influenced people into becoming who they are. From the knowledge that is reached through such investigations, people can thereafter decide which forces they believe are acceptable and which they consider to be intolerable and has to be changed. Freedom is for Foucault a type of \"experimentation\" with different \"transformations\". Since these experiments cannot be controlled completely, May argues they may either lead to the reconstruction of intolerable power relations or the creation of new ones. Thus, May argues, it is always necessary to continue with such experimentation and Foucauldian analyses.\nPractice of critique.\nFoucault's \"alternative\" to the modern subjectivity is described by Cressida Heyes as \"critique\". For Foucault there are no \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of subjectivity, since they are all a result of power relations. In the same way, Foucault argues there are no \"good\" and \"bad\" norms. All norms and institutions are at the same time enabling as they are oppressing. Therefore, Foucault argues, it is always crucial to continue with the practice of \"critique\". Critique is for Foucault a practice that searches for the processes and events that led to our way of being\u2014a questioning of who we \"are\" and how this \"we\" came to be. Such a \"critical ontology of the present\" shows that peoples' current \"being\" is in fact a historically contingent, unstable and changeable construction. Foucault emphasizes that since the current way of being is not a necessity, it is also possible to change it. Critique also includes investigating how and when people are being enabled and when they are being oppressed by the current norms and institutions, finding ways to reduce limitations on freedom, resist normalization and develop new and different way of relating to oneself and others. Foucault argues that it is impossible to go beyond power relations, but that it is always possible to navigate power relations in a different way.\n\"Epimeleia heautou\", \"care for the self\".\nAs an alternative to the modern \"search\" for the \"true self\", and as a part of \"the work of freedom\", Foucault discusses the antique Greek term epimeleia heautou, \"care for the self\" (\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6). According to Foucault, among the ancient Greek philosophers, self-awareness was not a goal in itself, but rather something that was sought after in order to \"care for oneself\". Care for the self consists of what Foucault calls \"the art of living\" or \"technologies of the self\". The goal of these techniques was, according to Foucault, to transform oneself into a more ethical person. As an example of this, Foucault mentions meditation, the stoic activity of contemplating past and future actions and evaluating if these actions are in line with one's values and goals, and \"contemplation of nature\". Contemplation of nature is another stoic activity, that consists of reflecting on how \"small\" one's existence is when compared to the greater cosmos.\nKnowledge.\nFoucault is described by Mary Beth Mader as an epistemological constructivist and historicist. Foucault is critical of the idea that humans can reach \"absolute\" knowledge about the world. A fundamental goal in many of Foucault's works is to show how that which has traditionally been considered as absolute, universal and true in fact are historically contingent. To Foucault, even the idea of absolute knowledge is a historically contingent idea. This does however not lead to epistemological nihilism; rather, Foucault argues that we \"always begin anew\" when it comes to knowledge. At the same time Foucault is critical of modern western philosophy for lacking \"spirituality\". With \"spirituality\" Foucault refers to a certain type of ethical being, and the processes that lead to this state of being. Foucault argues that such a spirituality was a natural part of the ancient Greek philosophy, where knowledge was considered as something that was only accessible to those that had an ethical character. According to Foucault this changed in the \"cartesian moment\", the moment when Ren\u00e9 Descartes reached the \"insight\" that self-awareness was something given (Cogito, ergo sum, \"I think, therefore I am\"), and from this \"insight\" Descartes drew conclusions about God, the world, and knowledge. According to Foucault, since Descartes knowledge has been something separate from ethics. In modern times, Foucault argues, anyone can reach \"knowledge\", as long as they are rational beings, educated, willing to participate in the scientific community and use a scientific method. Foucault is critical of this \"modern\" view of knowledge.\nFoucault describes two types of \"knowledge\": \"savoir\" and \"connaissance\", two French terms that both can be translated as \"knowledge\" but with separate meanings for Foucault. By \"savoir\" Foucault is referring to a process where subjects are created, while at the same time these subjects also become objects for knowledge. An example of this can be seen in criminology and psychiatry. In these sciences, subjects such as \"the rational person\", \"the mentally ill person\", \"the law abiding person\", \"the criminal\", etc. are created, and these sciences center their attention and knowledge on these subjects. The knowledge about these subjects is \"connaissance\", while the process in which subjects and knowledge are created is \"savoir\". A similar term in Foucault's corpus is \"pouvoir/savoir\" (power/knowledge). With this term Foucault is referring to a type of knowledge that is considered \"common sense\", but that is created and withheld in that position (as \"common sense\") by power. The term power/knowledge comes from Jeremy Bentham's idea that panopticons wouldn't only be prisons, but would be used for experiments where the criminals' behaviour would be studied. Power/knowledge thus refers to forms of power where the power compares individuals, measures differences, establishes a norm and then forces this norm unto the subjects. This is especially successful when the established norm is internalized and institutionalized (by \"institutionalized\" Foucault refers to when the norm is omnipresent). Because then, when the norm is internalized and institutionalized, it has effectively become a part of peoples' \"common sense\"\u2014the \"obvious\", the \"given\", the \"natural\". When this has happened, this \"common sense\" also affects the explicit knowledge (scientific knowledge), Foucault argues. Ellen K. Feder states that the premise \"the world consists of women and men\" is an example of this. This premise, Feder argues, has been considered \"common sense\", and has led to the creation of the psychiatric diagnosis gender identity disorder (GID). For example, during the 1970s, children with behavior that was not considered appropriate for their gender was diagnosed with GID. The treatment then consisted of trying to make the child adapt to the prevailing gender norms. Feder argues that this is an example of power/knowledge since psychiatry, from the \"common sense\" premise \"the world consists of women and men\" (a premise which is upheld in this status by power), created a new diagnosis, a new type of subject and a whole body of knowledge surrounding this new subject.\nInfluence and reception.\nFoucault's works have exercised a powerful influence over numerous humanistic and social scientific disciplines as one of the most influential and controversial scholars of the post-World War II period. According to a London School of Economics' analysis in 2016, his works \"Discipline and Punish\" and \"The History of Sexuality\" were among the 25 most cited books in the social sciences of all time, at just over 100,000 citations. In 2007, Foucault was listed as the single most cited scholar in the humanities by the \"ISI Web of Science\" among a large quantity of French philosophers, the compilation's author commenting that \"What this says of modern scholarship is for the reader to decide\u2014and it is imagined that judgments will vary from admiration to despair, depending on one's view\".\nAccording to Gary Gutting, Foucault's \"detailed historical remarks on the emergence of disciplinary and regulatory biopower have been widely influential\". Leo Bersani wrote that:\"[Foucault] is our most brilliant philosopher of power. More originally than any other contemporary thinker, he has attempted to define the historical constraints under which we live, at the same time that he has been anxious to account for\u2014if possible, even to locate\u2014the points at which we might resist those constraints and counter some of the moves of power. In the present climate of cynical disgust with the exercise of political power, Foucault's importance can hardly be exaggerated.\" Foucault's work on \"biopower\" has been widely influential within the disciplines of philosophy and political theory, particularly for such authors as Giorgio Agamben, Roberto Esposito, Antonio Negri, and Michael Hardt. His discussions on power and discourse have inspired many critical theorists, who believe that Foucault's analysis of power structures could aid the struggle against inequality. They claim that through discourse analysis, hierarchies may be uncovered and questioned by way of analyzing the corresponding fields of knowledge through which they are legitimated. This is one of the ways that Foucault's work is linked to critical theory. His work \"Discipline and Punish\" influenced his friend and contemporary Gilles Deleuze, who published the paper \"Postscript on the Societies of Control\", praising Foucault's work but arguing that contemporary western society has in fact developed from a 'disciplinary society' into a 'society of control'. Deleuze went on to publish a book dedicated to Foucault's thought in 1988 under the title \"Foucault\".\nFoucault's discussions of the relationship between power and knowledge has influenced postcolonial critiques in explaining the discursive formation of colonialism, particularly in Edward Said's work \"Orientalism\". Foucault's work has been compared to that of Erving Goffman by the sociologist Michael Hviid Jacobsen and Soren Kristiansen, who list Goffman as an influence on Foucault. Foucault's writings, particularly \"The History of Sexuality\", have also been very influential in feminist philosophy and queer theory, particularly the work of the major Feminist scholar Judith Butler due to his theories regarding the genealogy of maleness and femaleness, power, sexuality, and bodies.\nCritiques and engagements.\nDouglas Murray, writing in his book \"The War on The West\", argued that \"Foucault's obsessive analysis of everything through a quasi-Marxist lens of power relations diminished almost everything in society into a transactional, punitive and meaningless dystopia\".\nCrypto-normativity, self-refutation, defeatism.\nA prominent critique of Foucault's thought concerns his refusal to propose positive solutions to the social and political issues that he critiques. Since no human relation is devoid of power, freedom becomes elusive\u2014even as an ideal. This stance which critiques normativity as socially constructed and contingent, but which relies on an implicit norm to mount the critique led philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas to describe Foucault's thinking as \"crypto-normativist\", covertly reliant on the very Enlightenment principles he attempts to argue against. A similar critique has been advanced by Diana Taylor, and by Nancy Fraser who argues that \"Foucault's critique encompasses traditional moral systems, he denies himself by recourse to concepts such as 'freedom' and 'justice', and therefore lacks the ability to generate positive alternatives.\"\nGenealogy as historical method.\nThe philosopher Richard Rorty has argued that Foucault's \"archaeology of knowledge\" is fundamentally negative, and thus fails to adequately establish any \"new\" theory of knowledge \"per se\". Rather, Foucault simply provides a few valuable maxims regarding the reading of history. Rorty writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As far as I can see, all he has to offer are brilliant redescriptions of the past, supplemented by helpful hints on how to avoid being trapped by old historiographical assumptions. These hints consist largely of saying: \"do not look for progress or meaning in history; do not see the history of a given activity, of any segment of culture, as the development of rationality or of freedom; do not use any philosophical vocabulary to characterize the essence of such activity or the goal it serves; do not assume that the way this activity is presently conducted gives any clue to the goals it served in the past\".\nGenealogy emerged in Foucault's writing in the early 1970s as a corrective to what he saw as deficiencies in the previous methodology he described as archaeology. Specifically Genealogy allowed Foucault a method to explain how \"the epistemological succession of discursive formations\" could occur within the methodology of the older Archaeology.\nFoucault has frequently been criticized by historians for what they consider to be a lack of rigor in his analyses. For example, Hans-Ulrich Wehler harshly criticized Foucault in 1998. According to Wehler, Foucault's works are not only insufficient in their empirical historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault's concept of power is \"desperatingly undifferentiated\", and Foucault's thesis of a \"disciplinary society\" is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy.\nT'Jampens and Versieren describe Foucault as having experienced a severe personal crisis at the start of his \"Il faut d\u00e9fendre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9\" lecture series on the basis of the account of Gilles Deleuze. They describe this crisis as the culmination of Foucault's own doubts regarding \"certain key aspects of the genealogical method.\" They describe these lectures as the construction of a dialectic between the older archaeological method and the newer genealogical one, using the methodological tools of the first to correct Foucault's self-identified flaws in the second.\nFeminist critiques.\nThough American feminists have built on Foucault's critiques of the historical construction of gender roles and sexuality, some feminists note the limitations of the masculinist subjectivity and ethical orientation that he describes. A related issue raised by scholars Elizabeth Povinelli and Kathryn Yusoff is the almost complete absence of any discussion of race in his writings. Yusoff (2018, p.\u00a0211) says \"Povinelli draws our attention to the provinciality of Foucault's project in its conceptualization of a Western European genealogy\".\nSexuality.\nThe philosopher Roger Scruton argues in \"Sexual Desire\" (1986) that Foucault was incorrect to claim, in \"The History of Sexuality\", that sexual morality is culturally relative. He criticizes Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a \"problematisation\" of the sexual did not occur, concluding that, \"No history of thought could show the 'problematisation' of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order.\"\nFoucault's approach to sexuality, which he sees as socially constructed, has become influential in queer theory. Foucault's resistance to identity politics, and his rejection of the psychoanalytic concept of \"object choice\", stand at odds with some theories of queer identity.\nSocial constructionism and human nature.\nFoucault is sometimes criticized for his purported social constructionism, which some see as an affront to the concept of truth. In Foucault's 1971 televised debate with Noam Chomsky, Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice. Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating \"He struck me as completely amoral, I'd never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something.\"\nDefeatism in education and authority.\nPeruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, while acknowledging that Foucault contributed to give a right of citizenship in cultural life to certain marginal and eccentric experiences (of sexuality, of cultural repression, of madness), asserts that his radical critique of authority was detrimental to education.\nPsychology of the self.\nOne of Foucault's claims regarding the subjectivity of the self has been disputed. Opposing Foucault's view of subjectivity, Terje Sparby, Friedrich Edelh\u00e4user, and Ulrich W. Weger argue that other factors, such as biological, environmental, and cultural are explanations for the self.\n\"Forget Foucault\".\nJean Baudrillard's 1977 tract \"Oublier Foucault\" (trans. \"Forget Foucault\") made Baudrillard instantly infamous within France, as it was a devastating critical analysis of Foucault's book the \"History of Sexuality\"\u2014and of Foucault's entire oeuvre. In 1976, Jean Baudrillard sent this essay to the French magazine Critique, where Michel Foucault was an editor. Foucault was asked to reply, but remained silent. In it Baudrillard also launched attacks on those philosophers, like Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, who believed that sexual desire and sexual liberation could be a revolutionary force. Baudrillard asserted that \"Foucault's discourse is a mirror of the powers it describes.\" Since \"it is possible at last to talk with such definitive understanding about power, sexuality, the body, and discipline [...] it is because at some point all this is here and now over with.\" Therefore, with \"the coincidence between this new version of power and the new version of desire proposed by Deleuze and Lyotard [...] [which was] not accidental: it's simply that in Foucault power takes the place of desire [...] That is why there is no desire in Foucault: its place is already taken [...] When power blends into desire and desire blends into power, let's forget them both.\"\n\"Oublier Foucault\" was published in English in 1998 as part of the Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents series as \"Forget Foucault\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word \"hippie\" came from \"hipster\" and was used to describe beatniks who moved into New York City's Greenwich Village, San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, Los Angeles' Laurel Canyon, and Chicago's Old Town community. The term \"hippie\" was used in print by San Francisco writer Michael Fallon, helping popularize use of the term in the media, although the tag was seen elsewhere earlier.\nThe origins of the terms \"hip\" and \"hep\" are uncertain. By the 1940s, both had become part of African American jive slang and meant \"sophisticated; currently fashionable; fully up-to-date\". The Beats adopted the term \"hip\", and early hippies adopted the language and countercultural values of the Beat Generation. Hippies created their own communities, listened to psychedelic music, embraced the sexual revolution, and many used drugs such as marijuana and LSD to explore altered states of consciousness.\nIn 1967, the Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, and the Monterey International Pop Festival popularized hippie culture, leading to the Summer of Love on the West Coast of the United States, and the 1969 Woodstock Festival on the East Coast. Hippies in Mexico, known as \"jipitecas\", formed \"La Onda\" (the Wave) and gathered at Av\u00e1ndaro, while in New Zealand, nomadic housetruckers practiced alternative lifestyles and promoted sustainable energy at Nambassa. In the United Kingdom in 1970, many gathered at the gigantic third Isle of Wight Festival with a crowd of around 400,000 people. In later years, mobile \"peace convoys\" of New Age travellers made summer pilgrimages to free music festivals at Stonehenge and elsewhere. In Australia, hippies gathered at Nimbin for the 1973 Aquarius Festival and the annual Cannabis Law Reform Rally or MardiGrass. \"\"Piedra Roja\" Festival\", a major hippie event in Chile, was held in 1970. Hippie and psychedelic culture influenced 1960s to mid 1970s teenager and youth culture in Iron Curtain countries in Eastern Europe (see \"M\u00e1ni\u010dka\").\nHippie fashion and values had a major effect on culture, influencing popular music, television, film, literature, and the arts. Since the 1960s, mainstream society has assimilated many aspects of hippie culture. The religious and cultural diversity the hippies espoused has gained widespread acceptance, and their pop versions of Eastern philosophy and Asiatic spiritual concepts have reached a larger group. Those who participated in the hippie movement at its height were those born during or shortly after World War II, during the 1940s and early 1950s. These were the youngest of the Silent Generation and oldest of the Baby Boomers; the former who were the actual leaders of the movement as well as the early pioneers of rock music.\nEtymology.\nLexicographer Jesse Sheidlower, the principal American editor of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", argues that the terms \"hipster\" and \"hippie\" are derived from the word \"hip\", whose origins are unknown. The word \"hip\" in the sense of \"aware, in the know\" is first attested in a 1902 cartoon by Tad Dorgan, and first appeared in prose in a 1904 novel by George Vere Hobart (1867\u20131926), \"Jim Hickey: A Story of the One-Night Stands\", where an African-American character uses the slang phrase \"Are you hip?\"\nThe term \"hipster\" was coined by Harry Gibson in 1944. By the 1940s, the terms \"hip\", \"hep\" and \"hepcat\" were popular in Harlem jazz slang, although \"hep\" eventually came to denote an inferior status to \"hip\". In Greenwich Village in the early 1960s, New York City, young counterculture advocates were named \"hips\" because they were considered \"in the know\" or \"cool\", as opposed to being \"square\", meaning conventional and old-fashioned. In the April 27, 1961 issue of \"The Village Voice\", \"An open letter to JFK &amp; Fidel Castro\", Norman Mailer utilizes the term hippies, in questioning JFK's behavior. In a 1961 essay, Kenneth Rexroth used both the terms \"hipster\" and \"hippies\" to refer to young people participating in black American or Beatnik nightlife. According to Malcolm X's 1964 autobiography, the word \"hippie\" in 1940s Harlem had been used to describe a specific type of white man who \"acted more Negro than Negroes\". Andrew Loog Oldham refers to \"all the Chicago hippies,\" seemingly about black blues/R&amp;B musicians, in his rear sleeve notes to the 1965 LP \"The Rolling Stones, Now!\"\nAlthough the word \"hippies\" made other isolated appearances in print during the early 1960s, the first use of the term on the West Coast appeared in the article \"A New Paradise for Beatniks\" (in the \"San Francisco Examiner\", issue of September 5, 1965) by San Francisco journalist Michael Fallon. In that article, Fallon wrote about the Blue Unicorn Cafe (coffeehouse) (located at 1927 Hayes Street in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco), using the term \"hippie\" to refer to the new generation of beatniks who had moved from North Beach into the Haight-Ashbury district.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nA July 1967 \"Time\" magazine study on hippie philosophy credited the foundation of the hippie movement with historical precedent as far back as the sadhu of India, the spiritual seekers who had renounced the world and materialistic pursuits by taking Sannyasa. Even the counterculture of the Ancient Greeks, espoused by philosophers like Diogenes of Sinope and the cynics were also early forms of hippie culture. It also named as notable influences the religious and spiritual teachings of Buddha, Hillel the Elder, Jesus, St. Francis of Assisi, Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi and J. R. R. Tolkien.\nThe first signs of modern \"proto-hippies\" emerged at the end of the 19th century in Europe. Late 1890s to early 1900s, a German youth movement arose as a countercultural reaction to the organized social and cultural clubs that centered on \"German folk music\". Known as \"Der Wandervogel\" (\"wandering bird\"), this hippie movement opposed the formality of traditional German clubs, instead emphasizing folk music and singing, creative dress, and outdoor life involving hiking and camping. Inspired by the works of Goethe, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Hermann Hesse, Wandervogel attracted thousands of young Germans who rejected the rapid trend toward urbanization and yearned for the pagan, back-to-nature spiritual life of their ancestors. During the first several decades of the 20th century, Germans settled around the United States, bringing the values of this German youth culture. Some opened the first health food stores, and many moved to southern California where they introduced an alternative lifestyle. One group, called the \"Nature Boys\", took to the California desert and raised organic food, espousing a back-to-nature lifestyle like the Wandervogel. Songwriter eden ahbez wrote a hit song called \"Nature Boy\" inspired by Robert Bootzin (Gypsy Boots), who helped popularize health-consciousness, yoga, and organic food in the United States.\nThe hippie movement in the United States began as a youth movement. Composed mostly of white teenagers and young adults between 15 and 25 years old, hippies inherited a tradition of cultural dissent from bohemians and beatniks of the Beat Generation in the late 1950s. Beats like Allen Ginsberg crossed over from the beat movement and became fixtures of the burgeoning hippie and anti-war movements. By 1965, hippies had become an established social group in the U.S., and the movement eventually expanded to other countries, extending as far as the United Kingdom and Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Mexico, and Brazil. The hippie ethos influenced the Beatles and others in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, and they in turn influenced their American counterparts. Hippie culture spread worldwide through a fusion of rock music, folk, blues, and psychedelic rock; it also found expression in literature, the dramatic arts, fashion, and the visual arts, including film, posters advertising rock concerts, and album covers. In 1968, \"core visible hippies\" represented just under 0.2% of the U.S. population and dwindled away by mid-1970s.\nAlong with the New Left and the Civil Rights Movement, the hippie movement was one of three dissenting groups of the 1960s counterculture. Hippies rejected established institutions, criticized middle class values, opposed nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War, embraced aspects of Eastern philosophy, championed sexual liberation, were often vegetarian and eco-friendly, promoted the use of psychedelic drugs which they believed expanded one's consciousness, and created intentional communities or communes. They used alternative arts, street theatre, folk music, and psychedelic rock as a part of their lifestyle and as a way of expressing their feelings, their protests, and their vision of the world and life. Hippies opposed political and social orthodoxy, choosing a gentle and nondoctrinaire ideology that favored peace, love, and personal freedom, expressed for example in the Beatles' song \"All You Need is Love\". Hippies perceived the dominant culture as a corrupt, monolithic entity that exercised undue power over their lives, calling this culture \"the Establishment\", \"Big Brother\", or \"the Man\". Noting that they were \"seekers of meaning and value\", scholars like Timothy Miller have described hippies as a new religious movement.\n1958\u20131965: Early hippies.\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s, novelist Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters lived communally first in Oregon and after the 1962 success of his novel \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" in his San Francisco villa. Members included Beat Generation hero Neal Cassady, Ken Babbs, Carolyn Adams (aka Mountain Girl/Carolyn Garcia), Stewart Brand, Del Close, Paul Foster, George Walker, Sandy Lehmann-Haupt and others. Their adventures were documented in Tom Wolfe's book \"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\". With Cassady at the wheel of a school bus named Further, the Merry Pranksters traveled across the United States to celebrate the publication of Kesey's novel \"Sometimes a Great Notion\" and to visit the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. The Merry Pranksters were known for using cannabis, amphetamine, and LSD, and during their journey they \"turned on\" many people to these drugs. The Merry Pranksters filmed and audio-taped their bus trips, creating an immersive multimedia experience that would later be presented to the public in the form of festivals and concerts. The Grateful Dead wrote a song about the Merry Pranksters' bus trips called \"That's It for the Other One\".\nIn 1961, although being closely associated to the L.A. freak scene, Vito Paulekas and his wife Szou established in Hollywood a clothing boutique which was credited with being one of the first to introduce \"hippie\" fashion as well as a brand of free-form dancing that would become associated with hippie culture. Vito would also provide rehearsal space for the Byrds in 1964 and later Love, as well as helping bring attention to them by inviting his dance troupe to invade their concerts, they would later accompany the Byrds on a nationwide tour.\nDuring this period Greenwich Village in New York City and Berkeley, California anchored the American folk music circuit.\nBerkeley's two coffee houses, \"the Cabale Creamery\" and \"the Jabberwock\", sponsored performances by folk music artists in a beat setting.\nIn April 1963, Chandler A. Laughlin III, co-founder of the Cabale Creamery, established a kind of tribal, family identity among approximately fifty people who attended a traditional, all-night Native American peyote ceremony in a rural setting. This ceremony combined a psychedelic experience with traditional Native American spiritual values; these people went on to sponsor a unique genre of musical expression and performance at the \"Red Dog Saloon\" in the isolated, old-time mining town of Virginia City, Nevada.\n1965\u20131967: Rise to prevalence.\nDuring the summer of 1965, Laughlin recruited much of the original talent that led to a unique amalgam of traditional folk music and the developing psychedelic rock scene. He and his cohorts created at this very place what became known as \"The Red Dog Experience\", featuring previously unknown musical acts\u2014Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Charlatans, and others\u2014who played in the completely refurbished, intimate setting of Nevada, Virginia City's \"Red Dog Saloon\". There was no clear delineation between \"performers\" and \"audience\" in \"The Red Dog Experience\", during which music, psychedelic experimentation, a unique sense of personal style, and Bill Ham's first primitive light shows combined to create a new sense of community. Laughlin and George Hunter of the Charlatans were true \"proto-hippies\", with their long hair, boots, and outrageous clothing of 19th-century American (and Native American) heritage. LSD manufacturer Owsley Stanley lived in Berkeley during 1965 and provided much of the LSD that became a seminal part of the \"Red Dog Experience\", the early evolution of psychedelic rock and budding hippie culture. At the \"Red Dog Saloon\", the Charlatans were the first psychedelic rock band to play live (albeit unintentionally) loaded on LSD.\nWhen they returned to San Francisco, \"Red Dog\" participants Luria Castell, Ellen Harman and Alton Kelley created a collective called \"the Family Dog.\" Modeled on their \"Red Dog experiences\", on October 16, 1965, the \"Family Dog\" hosted \"A Tribute to Dr. Strange\" at Longshoreman's Hall. Attended by approximately one thousand of the Bay Area's original \"hippies\", this was San Francisco's first psychedelic rock performance, costumed dance and light show, featuring Jefferson Airplane, the Great Society and the Marbles. Two other events followed before year's end, one at \"California Hall\" and one at \"the Matrix\". After the first three \"Family Dog\" events, a much larger psychedelic event occurred at San Francisco's \"Longshoreman's Hall\". Called the \"Trips Festival\", it took place on January 21 \u2013 23, 1966, and was organized by Stewart Brand, Ken Kesey, Owsley Stanley and others. Ten thousand people attended this sold-out event, with a thousand more turned away each night. On Saturday January 22, the Grateful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company came on stage, and six thousand people arrived to imbibe punch spiked with LSD and to witness one of the first fully developed light shows of the era.\nBy February 1966, the \"Family Dog\" became \"Family Dog Productions\" under organizer Chet Helms, promoting happenings at the Avalon Ballroom and the Fillmore Auditorium in initial cooperation with Bill Graham. The Avalon Ballroom, the Fillmore Auditorium, and other venues provided settings where participants could partake of the full psychedelic music experience. Bill Ham, who had pioneered the original \"Red Dog\" light shows, perfected his art of liquid light projection, which combined light shows and film projection and became synonymous with the \"San Francisco ballroom experience\". The sense of style and costume that began at the \"Red Dog Saloon\" flourished when San Francisco's Fox Theater went out of business and hippies bought up its costume stock, reveling in the freedom to dress up for weekly musical performances at their favorite ballrooms. As \"San Francisco Chronicle\" music columnist Ralph J. Gleason put it, \"They danced all night long, orgiastic, spontaneous and completely free form.\"\nSome of the earliest San Francisco hippies were former students at San Francisco State College who became intrigued by the developing psychedelic hippie music scene. These students joined the bands they loved, living communally in the large, inexpensive Victorian apartments in the Haight-Ashbury. Young Americans around the country began moving to San Francisco, and by June 1966, around 15,000 hippies had moved into the Haight. the Charlatans, Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and the Grateful Dead all moved to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood during this period. Activity centered on the Diggers, a guerrilla street theatre group that combined spontaneous street theatre, anarchistic action, and art happenings in their agenda to create a \"free city\". By late 1966, the Diggers opened free stores which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.\nOn October 6, 1966, the state of California declared LSD a controlled substance, which made the drug illegal. In response to the criminalization of LSD, San Francisco hippies staged a gathering in the Golden Gate Park panhandle, called the Love Pageant Rally, attracting an estimated 700\u2013800 people. As explained by Allan Cohen, co-founder of the \"San Francisco Oracle\", the purpose of the rally was twofold: to draw attention to the fact that LSD had just been made illegal\u2014and to demonstrate that people who used LSD were not criminals, nor were they mentally ill. The Grateful Dead played, and some sources claim that LSD was consumed at the rally. According to Cohen, those who took LSD \"were not guilty of using illegal substances...We were celebrating transcendental consciousness, the beauty of the universe, the beauty of being.\"\nIn West Hollywood, California, the Sunset Strip curfew riots, also known as the \"hippie riots\", were a series of early counterculture-era clashes that took place between police and young people in 1966 and continuing on and off through the early 1970s. In 1966, annoyed residents and business owners in the district had encouraged the passage of strict (10:00\u00a0p.m.) curfew and loitering laws to reduce the traffic congestion resulting from crowds of young club patrons. This was perceived by young, local rock music fans as an infringement on their civil rights, and on Saturday, November 12, 1966, fliers were distributed along the Strip inviting people to demonstrate later that day. Hours before the protest one of the rock 'n' roll radio stations in L.A. announced there would be a rally at Pandora's Box, a club at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights, and cautioned people to tread carefully. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that as many as 1,000 youthful demonstrators, including such celebrities as Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda (who was afterward handcuffed by police), erupted in protest against the perceived repressive enforcement of these recently invoked curfew laws. This incident provided the basis for the 1967 low-budget teen exploitation film \"Riot on Sunset Strip\", and inspired multiple songs including the famous Buffalo Springfield song \"For What It's Worth\".\n1967: Human Be-In, Summer of Love, and popularity surge.\nOn January 14, 1967, the outdoor Human Be-In organized by Michael Bowen helped to popularize hippie culture across the United States, with 20,000 to 30,000 hippies gathering in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.\nOn March 26, 1967, Lou Reed, Edie Sedgwick and 10,000 hippies came together in Manhattan for the Central Park Be-In on Easter Sunday.\nThe KFRC Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival from June 10\u201311, and the Monterey Pop Festival from June 16\u201318, introduced the music of the counterculture - and the new concept of a rock festival - to a wide audience, and marked the start of the \"Summer of Love\".\nScott McKenzie's rendition of John Phillips' song \"San Francisco\" became a hit in the United States and Europe. The lyrics, \"If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair\", inspired thousands of young people from all over the world to travel to San Francisco, sometimes wearing flowers in their hair and distributing flowers to passersby, earning them the name \"Flower Children\". Bands like the Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company (with Janis Joplin), and Jefferson Airplane lived in the Haight.\nIn June 1967, Herb Caen was approached by \"a distinguished magazine\" to write about why hippies were attracted to San Francisco. He declined the assignment but interviewed hippies in the Haight for his own newspaper column in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\". Caen determined that, \"Except in their music, they couldn't care less about the approval of the straight world.\" Caen himself felt that the city of San Francisco was so straight that it provided a visible contrast with hippie culture.\nOn July 7, 1967 \"Time\" magazine featured a cover story entitled \"The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture.\" The article described the guidelines of the hippie code:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Do your own thing, wherever you have to do it and whenever you want. Drop out. Leave society as you have known it. Leave it utterly. Blow the mind of every straight person you can reach. Turn them on, if not to drugs, then to beauty, love, honesty, fun.\n\u201cIt is estimated that around 100,000 people traveled to San Francisco in the summer of 1967. The media was right behind them, casting a spotlight on the Haight-Ashbury district and popularizing the \u2018hippie\u2019 label. With this increased attention, hippies found support for their ideals of love and peace but were also criticized for their anti\u2011work, pro\u2011drug, and permissive ethos.\nAt this point, the Beatles had released their groundbreaking album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", which was quickly embraced by the hippie movement with its colorful psychedelic sonic imagery.\nIn 1967 Chet Helms brought the Haight Ashbury hippie and psychedelic scene to Denver, when he opened the Family Dog Denver, modeled on his Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco. The music venue created a nexus for the hippie movement in the western-minded Denver, which led to serious conflicts with city leaders, parents and the police, who saw the hippie movement as dangerous. The resulting legal actions and pressure caused Helms and Bob Cohen to close the venue at the end of that year.\nBy the end of the summer, the Haight-Ashbury scene had deteriorated. The incessant media coverage led the Diggers to declare the \"death\" of the hippie with a parade. According to poet Susan 'Stormi' Chambless, the hippies buried an effigy of a hippie in the Panhandle to demonstrate the end of his/her reign. Haight-Ashbury could not accommodate the influx of crowds (mostly naive youngsters) with no place to live. Many took to living on the street, panhandling and drug-dealing. There were problems with malnourishment, disease, and drug addiction. Crime and violence skyrocketed. None of these trends reflected what the hippies had envisioned. \nBy the end of 1967, many of the hippies and musicians who initiated the Summer of Love had moved on. Beatle George Harrison had once visited Haight-Ashbury and found it to be just a haven for dropouts, inspiring him to give up LSD. Misgivings about the hippie culture, particularly with regard to substance use and lenient morality, fueled the moral panics of the late 1960s.\n1967\u20131970: Revolution and peak of influence.\nBy 1968, hippie-influenced fashions were beginning to take off in the mainstream, especially for youths and younger adults of the populous baby boomer generation, many of whom may have aspired to emulate the hardcore movements now living in tribalistic communes, but had no overt connections to them. This was noticed not only in terms of clothes and longer hair for men, but also in music, film, art and literature, not just in the United States, but around the world. Eugene McCarthy's brief presidential campaign successfully persuaded a significant minority of young adults to \"get clean for Gene\" by shaving their beards or wearing longer skirts; however the \"Clean Genes\" had little impact on the popular image in the media spotlight, of the hirsute hippy adorned in beads, feathers, flowers and bells.\nA sign of this was the visibility that the hippie subculture gained in various mainstream and underground media. Hippie exploitation films are 1960s exploitation films about the hippie counterculture with stereotypical situations associated with the movement such as cannabis and LSD use, sex and wild psychedelic parties. Examples include \"The Love-ins\", \"Psych-Out\", \"The Trip\", and \"Wild in the Streets\". Other more serious and more critically acclaimed films about the hippie counterculture also appeared such as \"Easy Rider\" and \"Alice's Restaurant\". (See also: List of films related to the hippie subculture.) Documentaries and television programs have also been produced until today as well as fiction and nonfiction books. The popular Broadway musical \"Hair\" was presented in 1967.\nPeople commonly label other cultural movements of that period as hippie, but there are differences. For example, hippies were often not directly engaged in politics, as contrasted with \"Yippies\" (Youth International Party), an activist organization. The Yippies came to national attention during their celebration of the 1968 spring equinox, when some 3,000 of them took over Grand Central Terminal in New York\u2014eventually resulting in 61 arrests. Especially their leaders Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, the Yippies became notorious for their theatrics, such as trying to levitate the Pentagon at the October 1967 war protest, and such slogans as \"Rise up and abandon the creeping meatball!\" Their stated intention to protest the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, including nominating their own candidate, \"Lyndon Pigasus Pig\" (an actual pig), was also widely publicized in the media at this time.\nIn Cambridge, Massachusetts hippies congregated each Sunday for a large \"be-in\" at Cambridge Common with swarms of drummers and those beginning the Women's Movement. In the United States, the Hippie movement started to be seen as part of the \"New Left\", which was associated with anti-war college-campus protest movements. The New Left was a term used mainly in the United Kingdom and United States in reference to activists, educators, agitators and others in the 1960s and 1970s who sought to implement a broad range of reforms on issues such as gay rights, abortion, gender roles and drugs in contrast to earlier leftist or Marxist movements that had taken a more vanguardist approach to social justice and focused mostly on labor unionization and questions of social class.\nIn April 1969, the building of People's Park in Berkeley, California received international attention. The University of California, Berkeley had demolished all the buildings on a parcel near campus, intending to use the land to build playing fields and a parking lot. After a long delay, during which the site became a dangerous eyesore, thousands of ordinary Berkeley citizens, merchants, students, and hippies took matters into their own hands, planting trees, shrubs, flowers and grass to convert the land into a park. A major confrontation ensued on May 15, 1969, when Governor Ronald Reagan ordered the park destroyed, which led to a two-week occupation of the city of Berkeley by the California National Guard. Flower power came into its own during this occupation as hippies engaged in acts of civil disobedience to plant flowers in empty lots all over Berkeley under the slogan \"Let a Thousand Parks Bloom\".\nIn August 1969, the Woodstock Music and Art Fair took place in Bethel, New York, which for many, exemplified the best of hippie counterculture. Over 500,000 people arrived to hear some of the most notable musicians and bands of the era, among them Canned Heat, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Carlos Santana, Sly and the Family Stone, the Who, Jefferson Airplane and Jimi Hendrix. Wavy Gravy's Hog Farm provided security and attended to practical needs, and the hippie ideals of love and human fellowship seemed to have gained real-world expression. Similar rock festivals occurred in other parts of the country, which played a significant role in spreading hippie ideals throughout America.\nIn December 1969, a rock festival took place in Altamont, California, about 45\u00a0km (30 miles) east of San Francisco. Initially billed as \"Woodstock West\", its official name was the Altamont Free Concert. About 300,000 people gathered to hear the Rolling Stones; Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young; Jefferson Airplane and other bands. The Hells Angels provided security that proved far less benevolent than the security provided at the Woodstock event: 18-year-old Meredith Hunter was stabbed and killed by one of the Hells Angels during the Rolling Stones' performance after he brandished a gun and waved it toward the stage.\n1970\u20131973: Aftershocks and decline.\nBy the 1970s, the 1960s zeitgeist that had spawned hippie culture seemed to be on the wane. The events at the Altamont Free Concert shocked many Americans, including those who had strongly identified with hippie culture. Another shock came in the form of the Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca murders committed in August 1969 by Charles Manson and his \"family\" of followers.\nNevertheless, the turbulent political atmosphere that featured the bombing of Cambodia and shootings by National Guardsmen at Jackson State University and Kent State University still brought people together. These shootings inspired the May 1970 song by Quicksilver Messenger Service \"What About Me?\", where they sang, \"You keep adding to my numbers as you shoot my people down\", as well as Neil Young's \"Ohio\", a song that protested the Kent State massacre, recorded by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. The anti-war movement reached its peak at the 1971 May Day Protests as over 12,000 protesters were arrested in Washington, D.C.; President Nixon himself actually ventured out of the White House and chatted with a group of the hippie protesters. The draft was ended soon thereafter, in January 1973.\n1973\u2013present: Absorption into the mainstream and new developments.\nMuch of hippie style had been integrated into mainstream American society by the early 1970s. Large rock concerts that originated with the 1967 KFRC Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival and Monterey Pop Festival and the British Isle of Wight Festival in 1968 became the norm, evolving into stadium rock in the process. During the mid-late 1970s, with the end of the draft and the Vietnam War, a renewal of patriotic sentiment associated with the approach of the United States Bicentennial, the decline in popularity of psychedelic rock, and the emergence of new genres such as prog rock, heavy metal, disco, and punk rock, the mainstream media lost interest in the hippie counterculture. At the same time there was a revival of the Mod subculture, skinheads, teddy boys and the emergence of new youth cultures, like the punks, goths (an arty offshoot of punk), and football casuals; starting in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Britain, hippies had begun to come under attack by skinheads.\nMany hippies would adapt and become members of the growing countercultural New Age movement of the 1970s. While many hippies made a long-term commitment to the lifestyle, some people argue that hippies \"sold out\" during the 1980s and became part of the materialist, self-centered consumer yuppie culture. Although not as visible as it once was, hippie culture has never died out completely: hippies and neo-hippies can still be found on college campuses, on communes, and at gatherings and festivals. Many embrace the hippie values of peace, love, and community, and hippies may still be found in bohemian enclaves around the world. Hippie communes, where members tried to live the ideals of the hippie movement, continued to flourish. On the West Coast, Oregon had quite a few, while in 1970, the hippie community of Tawapa was founded in New Mexico. It lasted until the 1990s, when the people were pushed off the land due to housing developments. Around 1994, a new term, \"Zippie\", was being used to describe hippies that had embraced New Age beliefs, new technology, and a love for electronic music.\nEthos and characteristics.\nThe bohemian predecessor of the hippie culture in San Francisco was the \"Beat Generation\" style of coffee houses and bars, whose clientele appreciated literature, a game of chess, music (in the forms of jazz and folk style), modern dance, and traditional crafts and arts like pottery and painting.\" The entire tone of the \"new\" subculture was different. Jon McIntire, manager of the Grateful Dead from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s, points out that the great contribution of the hippie culture was this projection of joy. \"The beatnik thing was black, cynical, and cold.\" Hippies sought to free themselves from societal restrictions, choose their own way, and find new meaning in life. One expression of hippie independence from societal norms was found in their standard of dress and grooming, which made hippies instantly recognizable to one another, and served as a visual symbol of their respect for individual rights. Through their appearance, hippies declared their willingness to question authority, and distanced themselves from the \"straight\" and \"square\" (i.e., conformist) segments of society. Personality traits and values that hippies tend to be associated with are \"altruism and mysticism, honesty, joy and nonviolence\".\nArt and fashion.\nLeading proponents of the 1960s Psychedelic Art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, Bonnie MacLean, Stanley Mouse and Alton Kelley, and Wes Wilson. Their psychedelic-rock concert posters were inspired by Art Nouveau, Victoriana, Dada, and Pop Art. Posters for concerts in the Fillmore West, a concert auditorium in San Francisco, popular with hippie audiences, were among the most notable of the time. Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style. The style flourished from roughly the years 1966 until 1972. Their work was immediately influential to album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers.\nPsychedelic light shows were a new art form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors, the light-show artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music. This was mixed with slide shows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form, and to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely \"trippy\" atmosphere for the audience.\nThe Brotherhood of Light were responsible for many of the light shows in San Francisco psychedelic rock concerts.\nOut of the psychedelic counterculture there also arose a new genre of comic books: underground comix. \"Zap Comix\" was among the original underground comics, and featured the work of Robert Crumb, S. Clay Wilson, Victor Moscoso, Rick Griffin, and Robert Williams among others. Underground comix were ribald and intensely satirical, and seemed to pursue weirdness for the sake of weirdness. Gilbert Shelton created perhaps the most enduring of underground cartoon characters, \"The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers\", whose drugged-out exploits held a mirror up to the hippie lifestyle of the 1960s.\nAs in other counterculture movements such as the beat movement and the later punk movement, hippie symbols and iconography were purposely borrowed from either \"low\" or \"primitive\" cultures, with hippie fashion reflecting a disorderly, often vagrant style. As with other adolescent, white middle-class movements, deviant behavior of the hippies involved challenging the prevailing gender differences of their time: both men and women in the hippie movement wore jeans and maintained long hair, and both genders wore sandals, moccasins or went barefoot. Men often wore beards, while women wore little or no makeup, with many going braless. Hippies often chose brightly colored clothing and wore unusual styles, such as bell-bottom pants, vests, tie-dyed garments, dashikis, peasant blouses, and long, full skirts; non-Western inspired clothing with Native American, Latin American, African and Asiatic motifs was also popular. Much hippie clothing was self-made in defiance of corporate culture, and hippies often purchased their clothes from flea markets and second-hand shops. Favored accessories for both men and women included Native American jewelry, head scarves, headbands, long beaded necklaces, and circular \"John Lennon\" style glasses. Hippie homes, vehicles and other possessions were often decorated with psychedelic art. The bold colors, hand-made clothing and loose fitting clothes opposed the tight and uniform clothing of the 1940s and 1950s. It also rejected consumerism in that the hand-production of clothing called for self-efficiency and individuality.\nLove and sex.\nThe common stereotype on the issues of love and sex had it that the hippies were \"promiscuous, having wild sex orgies, seducing innocent teenagers and every manner of sexual perversion.\" The hippie movement appeared concurrently in the midst of a rising sexual revolution, in which many views of the \"status quo\" on this subject were being challenged.\nThe clinical study \"Human Sexual Response\" was published by Masters and Johnson in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)\" by psychiatrist David Reuben was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared \"The Joy of Sex\" by Alex Comfort, reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects of sexual behavior were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted not just from the publication of such new books as these, but from a more pervasive sexual revolution that had already been well underway for some time.\nThe hippies inherited various countercultural views and practices regarding sex and love from the Beat Generation; \"their writings influenced the hippies to open up when it came to sex, and to experiment without guilt or jealousy.\" One popular hippie slogan that appeared was \"If it feels good, do it!\" which for many meant \"you are free to love whomever you please, whenever you please, however you please\". This encouraged spontaneous sexual activity and experimentation. Group sex, public sex, homosexuality; under the influence of drugs, all the taboos went out the window. This doesn't mean that straight sex or monogamy were unknown, quite the contrary. Nevertheless, the open relationship became an accepted part of the hippie lifestyle. This meant that you might have a primary relationship with one person, but if another attracted you, you could explore that relationship without rancor or jealousy.\"\nHippies embraced the old slogan of free love of the radical social reformers of other eras; it was accordingly observed that \"Free love made the whole love, marriage, sex, baby package obsolete. Love was no longer limited to one person, you could love anyone you chose. In fact love was something you shared with everyone, not just your sex partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more you share, the more you get! So why reserve your love for a select few? This profound truth was one of the great hippie revelations.\" Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors. Others explored the spiritual aspects of sex.\nTravel.\nHippies tended to travel light, and could pick up and go wherever the action was at any time. Whether at a love-in on Mount Tamalpais near San Francisco, a demonstration against the Vietnam War in Berkeley, or one of Ken Kesey's \"Acid Tests\", if the \"vibe\" was not right and a change of scene was desired, hippies were mobile at a moment's notice. Planning was eschewed, as hippies were happy to put a few clothes in a backpack, stick out their thumbs and hitchhike anywhere. Hippies seldom worried whether they had money, hotel reservations or any of the other standard accoutrements of travel. Hippie households welcomed overnight guests on an impromptu basis, and the reciprocal nature of the lifestyle permitted greater freedom of movement. People generally cooperated to meet each other's needs in ways that became less common after the early 1970s. This way of life is still seen among Rainbow Family groups, new age travellers and New Zealand's housetruckers.\nA derivative of this free-flow style of travel were the hippie trucks and buses, hand-crafted mobile houses built on a truck or bus chassis to facilitate a nomadic lifestyle, as documented in the 1974 book \"Roll Your Own\". Some of these mobile houses were quite elaborate, with beds, toilets, showers and cooking facilities.\nOn the West Coast, a unique lifestyle developed around the Renaissance Faires that Phyllis and Ron Patterson first organized in 1963. During the summer and fall months, entire families traveled together in their trucks and buses, parked at Renaissance Pleasure Faire sites in Southern and Northern California, worked their crafts during the week, and donned Elizabethan costume for weekend performances, and attended booths where handmade goods were sold to the public. The sheer number of young people living at the time made for unprecedented travel opportunities to special happenings. The peak experience of this type was the Woodstock Festival near Bethel, New York, from August 15 to 18, 1969, which drew between 400,000 and 500,000 people.\nHippie trail.\nOne travel experience, undertaken by hundreds of thousands of hippies between 1969 and 1971, was the Hippie trail overland route to India. Carrying little or no luggage, and with small amounts of cash, almost all followed the same route, hitch-hiking across Europe to Athens and on to Istanbul, then by train through central Turkey via Erzurum, continuing by bus into Iran, via Tabriz and Tehran to Mashhad, across the Afghan border into Herat, through southern Afghanistan via Kandahar to Kabul, over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, via Rawalpindi and Lahore to the Indian frontier. Once in India, hippies went to many different destinations, but gathered in large numbers on the beaches of Goa and Kovalam in Trivandrum (Kerala), or crossed the border into Nepal to spend months in Kathmandu. In Kathmandu, most of the hippies hung out in the tranquil surroundings of a place called Freak Street (Nepal Bhasa: Jhoo Chhen), which still exists near Kathmandu Durbar Square.\nSpirituality and religion.\nMany hippies rejected mainstream organized religion in favor of a more personal spiritual experience. Buddhism and Hinduism often resonated with hippies, as they were seen as less rule-bound, and less likely to be associated with existing baggage. Some hippies embraced neo-paganism, especially Wicca. Others were involved with the occult, with people like Timothy Leary citing Aleister Crowley as influences. By the 1960s, western interest in Hindu spirituality and yoga reached its peak, giving rise to a great number of Neo-Hindu schools specifically advocated to a western public.\nIn his 1991 book, \"Hippies and American Values\", Timothy Miller described the hippie ethos as essentially a \"religious movement\" whose goal was to transcend the limitations of mainstream religious institutions. \"Like many dissenting religions, the hippies were enormously hostile to the religious institutions of the dominant culture, and they tried to find new and adequate ways to do the tasks the dominant religions failed to perform.\" In his seminal, contemporaneous work, \"The Hippie Trip\", author Lewis Yablonsky notes that those who were most respected in hippie settings were the spiritual leaders, the so-called \"high priests\" who emerged during that era.\nOne such hippie \"high priest\" was San Francisco State University Professor Stephen Gaskin. Beginning in 1966, Gaskin's \"Monday Night Class\" eventually outgrew the lecture hall, and attracted 1,500 hippie followers in an open discussion of spiritual values, drawing from Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu teachings. In 1970 Gaskin founded a Tennessee community called The Farm, and even late in life he still listed his religion as \"Hippie.\"\nTimothy Leary was an American psychologist and writer, known for his advocacy of psychedelic drugs. On September 19, 1966, Leary founded the League for Spiritual Discovery, a religion declaring LSD as its holy sacrament, in part as an unsuccessful attempt to maintain legal status for the use of LSD and other psychedelics for the religion's adherents based on a \"freedom of religion\" argument. \"The Psychedelic Experience\" was the inspiration for John Lennon's song \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" in the Beatles' album \"Revolver\". Leary published a pamphlet in 1967 called \"Start Your Own Religion\" to encourage just that and was invited to attend the January 14, 1967 Human Be-In, a gathering of 20,000 to 30,000 hippies in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. In speaking to the group, he coined the famous phrase \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\".\nThe English magician Aleister Crowley became an influential icon to the new alternative spiritual movements of the decade as well as for rock musicians. The Beatles included him as one of the many figures on the cover sleeve of their 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", while Jimmy Page, the guitarist of the Yardbirds and co-founder of 1970s rock band Led Zeppelin, was fascinated by Crowley, and owned some of his clothing, manuscripts and ritual objects, and during the 1970s bought Boleskine House, which appears in the band's 1976 film \"The Song Remains the Same\". On the back cover of the Doors 1970 compilation album \"13\", Jim Morrison and the other members of the Doors are shown posing with a bust of Aleister Crowley. Timothy Leary also openly acknowledged Crowley's inspiration.\nAfter the hippie era, the Dudeist philosophy and lifestyle developed. Inspired by \"the Dude\", the neo-hippie protagonist of the Coen Brothers' 1998 film \"The Big Lebowski\", Dudeism's stated primary objective is to promote a modern form of Chinese Taoism, outlined in \"Tao Te Ching\" by Laozi (6th century BC), blended with concepts by the Ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341\u2013270 BC), and presented in a style as personified by the character of Jeffrey \"the Dude\" Lebowski, a fictional hippie character portrayed by Jeff Bridges in the film. Dudeism has sometimes been regarded as a mock religion, though its founder and many adherents regard it seriously.\nPolitics.\nFor the historian of the anarchist movement Ronald Creagh, the hippie movement could be considered as the last spectacular resurgence of utopian socialism. For Creagh, a characteristic of this is the desire for the transformation of society not through political revolution, or through reformist action pushed forward by the state, but through the creation of a counter-society of a socialist character in the midst of the current system, which will be made up of ideal communities of a more or less libertarian social form.\nThe peace symbol was developed in the UK as a logo for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and was embraced by U.S. anti-war protesters during the 1960s. Hippies were often pacifists, and participated in nonviolent political demonstrations, such as Civil Rights Movement, the marches on Washington, D.C., and anti\u2013Vietnam War demonstrations, including draft-card burnings and the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests. The degree of political involvement varied widely among hippies, from those who were active in peace demonstrations, to the more anti-authority street theater and demonstrations of the Yippies, the most politically active hippie sub-group. Bobby Seale discussed the differences between Yippies and hippies with Jerry Rubin, who told him that Yippies were the political wing of the hippie movement, as hippies have not \"necessarily become political yet\". Regarding the political activity of hippies, Rubin said, \"They mostly prefer to be stoned, but most of them want peace, and they want an end to this stuff.\"\nIn addition to nonviolent political demonstrations, hippie opposition to the Vietnam War included organizing political action groups to oppose the war, refusal to serve in the military and conducting \"teach-ins\" on college campuses that covered Vietnamese history and the larger political context of the war.\nScott McKenzie's 1967 rendition of John Phillips' song \"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\", which helped to inspire the hippie Summer of Love, became a homecoming song for all Vietnam veterans arriving in San Francisco from 1967 onward. McKenzie has dedicated every American performance of \"San Francisco\" to Vietnam veterans, and he sang in 2002 at the 20th anniversary of the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Hippie political expression often took the form of \"dropping out\" of society to implement the changes they sought.\nPolitically motivated movements aided by hippies include the back to the land movement of the 1960s, cooperative business enterprises, alternative energy, the free press movement, and organic farming.\nThe San Francisco group known as the Diggers articulated an influential radical criticism of contemporary mass consumer society, and so they opened free stores which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art. The Diggers took their name from the original English Diggers (1649\u201350) led by Gerrard Winstanley, and they sought to create a mini-society free of money and capitalism.\nSuch activism was ideally carried through anti-authoritarian and non-violent means; thus it was observed that \"The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe.\"\nThe political ideals of hippies influenced other movements, such as anarcho-punk, rave culture, green politics, stoner culture and the New Age movement. Arguments can be made that being \"woke\" is only the latest natural offshoot of hipness, since both seek heightened \"awareness\" of one's surroundings (social, political, sexual etc.). For example, John Leland elaborates on the origins of coded language from African American slaves as a type of aware hipness and documents connections to downtrodden Jews and other minorities in American society in \"Hip: The History\".\nPenny Rimbaud of the English anarcho-punk band Crass said in interviews, and in an essay called \"The Last of the Hippies\", that Crass was formed in memory of his friend Wally Hope. Crass had its roots in Dial House, which was established in 1967 as a commune. Some punks were often critical of Crass for their involvement in the hippie movement. Like Crass, Jello Biafra was influenced by the hippie movement, and cited the yippies as a key influence on his political activism and thinking, though he also wrote songs critical of hippies.\nDrugs.\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Beats, many hippies used cannabis (marijuana), considering it pleasurable and benign. They used drugs such as marijuana, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, or magic mushrooms, and mescaline (peyote) to gain spiritual awakening.\nOn the East Coast of the United States, Harvard University professors Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) advocated psychotropic drugs for psychotherapy, self-exploration, religious and spiritual use. Regarding LSD, Leary said, \"Expand your consciousness and find ecstasy and revelation within.\"\nOn the West Coast of the United States, Ken Kesey was an important figure in promoting the recreational use of psychotropic drugs, especially LSD, also known as \"acid.\" By holding what he called \"Acid Tests\", and touring the country with his band of Merry Pranksters, Kesey became a magnet for media attention that drew many young people to the fledgling movement. The Grateful Dead (originally billed as the Warlocks) played some of their first shows at the Acid Tests, often as high on LSD as their audiences. Kesey and the Pranksters had a \"vision of turning on the world.\" Harder drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamines and heroin, were also sometimes used in hippie settings; however, these drugs were often disdained, even among those who used them, because they were recognized as harmful and addictive.\nLegacy.\nCulture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The '60s were a leap in human consciousness. Mahatma Gandhi, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Che Guevara, they led a revolution of conscience. The Beatles, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix created revolution and evolution themes. The music was like Dal\u00ed, with many colors and revolutionary ways. The youth of today must go there to find themselves.\"\n \u2014 Carlos Santana\nThe legacy of the hippie movement continues to permeate Western society. In general, unmarried couples of all ages feel free to travel and live together without societal disapproval. Frankness regarding sexual matters has become more common, and the rights of homosexual, bisexual and transgender people, as well as people who choose not to categorize themselves at all, have expanded. Religious and cultural diversity has gained greater acceptance.\nCo-operative business enterprises and creative community living arrangements are more accepted than before. Some of the little hippie health food stores of the 1960s and 1970s are now large-scale, profitable businesses, due to greater interest in natural foods, herbal remedies, vitamins and other nutritional supplements.\nIt has been suggested that 1960s and 1970s counterculture embraced certain types of \"groovy\" science and technology. Examples include surfboard design, renewable energy, aquaculture and client-centered approaches to midwifery, childbirth, and women's health.\nAuthors Stewart Brand and John Markoff argue that the development and popularization of personal computers and the Internet find one of their primary roots in the anti-authoritarian ethos promoted by hippie culture.\nDistinct appearance and clothing was one of the immediate legacies of hippies worldwide. During the 1960s and 1970s, mustaches, beards and long hair became more commonplace and colorful, while multi-ethnic clothing dominated the fashion world. Since that time, a wide range of personal appearance options and clothing styles, including nudity, have become more widely acceptable, all of which was uncommon before the hippie era. Hippies also inspired the decline in popularity of the necktie and other business clothing, which had been unavoidable for men during the 1950s and early 1960s. Additionally, hippie fashion itself has been commonplace in the years since the 1960s in clothing and accessories, particularly the peace symbol. Astrology, including everything from serious study to whimsical amusement regarding personal traits, was integral to hippie culture. The generation of the 1970s became influenced by the hippie and the 1960s countercultural legacy. As such in New York City musicians and audiences from the female, homosexual, Black, and Latino communities adopted several traits from the hippies and psychedelia. They included overpowering sound, free-form dancing, multi-colored, pulsating lighting, colorful costumes, and hallucinogens. 1960s Psychedelic soul groups like the Chambers Brothers and especially Sly and the Family Stone influenced George Clinton, P-funk and the Temptations. In addition, the perceived positivity, lack of irony, and earnestness of the hippies informed proto-disco music like M.F.S.B.'s album \"Love Is the Message\". Disco music supported the '70s LGBT movement.\nThe hippie legacy in literature includes the lasting popularity of books reflecting the hippie experience, such as \"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\". In 1995, \"The Sekhmet Hypothesis\" attempted to link both hippie and rave culture together in relation to transactional analysis, suggesting that rave culture was a social archetype based on the mood of friendly strength, compared to the gentle hippie archetype, based on friendly weakness. The later electronic dance genres known as goa trance and psychedelic trance and its related events and culture have important hippie legacies and neo hippie elements. The popular DJ of the genre Goa Gil, like other hippies from the 1960s, left the US and Western Europe to travel on the hippie trail and later developed psychedelic parties and music in the Indian state of Goa, in which the goa and psytrance genres were born and exported around the world in the 1990s and 2000s.\nMusic.\nIn music, the folk rock and psychedelic rock popular among hippies evolved into genres such as acid rock, world beat and heavy metal music. Psychedelic trance (also known as psytrance) is a type of electronic music influenced by 1960s psychedelic rock. The tradition of hippie music festivals began in the United States in 1965 with Ken Kesey's Acid Tests, where the Grateful Dead played tripping on LSD and initiated psychedelic jamming. For the next several decades, many hippies and neo-hippies became part of the Deadhead community, attending music and art festivals held around the country. The Grateful Dead toured continuously, with few interruptions between 1965 and 1995. Phish and their fans (called \"Phish Heads\") operated in the same manner, with the band touring continuously between 1983 and 2004. Many contemporary bands performing at hippie festivals and their derivatives are called jam bands, since they play songs that contain long instrumentals similar to the original hippie bands of the 1960s.\nWith the demise of Grateful Dead and Phish, nomadic touring hippies attend a growing series of summer festivals, the largest of which is called the Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival, which premiered in 2002. The Oregon Country Fair is a three-day festival featuring handmade crafts, educational displays and costumed entertainment. The annual Starwood Festival, founded in 1981, is a seven-day event indicative of the spiritual quest of hippies through an exploration of non-mainstream religions and world-views, and has offered performances and classes by a variety of hippie and counter-culture icons.\nThe Burning Man festival began in 1986 at a San Francisco beach party and is now held in the Black Rock Desert northeast of Reno, Nevada. Although few participants would accept the \"hippie\" label, Burning Man is a contemporary expression of alternative community in the same spirit as early hippie events. The gathering becomes a temporary city (36,500 occupants in 2005, 50,000+ in 2011), with elaborate encampments, displays, and many art cars. Other events that enjoy a large attendance include the Rainbow Family Gatherings, the Gathering of the Vibes, Community Peace Festivals, and the Woodstock Festivals.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK, there are many new age travellers who are known as hippies to outsiders, but prefer to call themselves the Peace Convoy. They started the Stonehenge Free Festival in 1974, but English Heritage later banned the festival in 1985, resulting in the Battle of the Beanfield. With Stonehenge banned as a festival site, new age travellers gather at the annual Glastonbury Festival. Today, hippies in the UK can be found in parts of South West England, such as Bristol (particularly the neighborhoods of Montpelier, Stokes Croft, St Werburghs, Bishopston, Easton and Totterdown), Glastonbury in Somerset, Totnes in Devon, and Stroud in Gloucestershire, as well as in Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, and in areas of London and Cornwall. In the summer, many hippies and those of similar subcultures gather at numerous outdoor festivals in the countryside.\nIn New Zealand, between 1976 and 1981, tens of thousands of hippies gathered from around the world on large farms around Waihi and Waikino for music and alternatives festivals. Named \"Nambassa\", the festivals focused on peace, love, and a balanced lifestyle. The events featured practical workshops and displays advocating alternative lifestyles, self sufficiency, clean and sustainable energy and sustainable living.\nIn the UK and Europe, the years 1987 until 1989 were marked by a large-scale revival of many characteristics of the hippie movement. This later movement, composed mostly of people aged 18 to 25, adopted much of the original hippie philosophy of love, peace and freedom. The summer of 1988 became known as the Second Summer of Love. Although the music favored by this movement was modern electronic music, especially house music and acid house, one could often hear songs from the original hippie era in the \"chill out rooms\" at raves. Also, there was a trend towards psychedelic indie rock in the form of shoegaze, dream pop, Madchester and neo-psychedelic bands like Jesus And Mary Chain, the Sundays, Spacemen 3, Loop, Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets and Ride. This was effectively a parallel soundtrack to the rave scene that was rooted as much in 1960s psychedelic rock as it was in post-punk, though Madchester was more directly influenced by acid house, funk and northern soul. Many ravers were originally soul boys and football casuals, and football hooliganism declined after the Second Summer of Love. In the UK, many of the well-known figures of this movement first lived communally in Stroud Green, an area of north London located in Finsbury Park. \nMedia.\nPopular films depicting the hippie ethos and lifestyle include \"Woodstock\", \"Easy Rider\", \"Hair\", \"The Doors\", \"Across the Universe\", \"Taking Woodstock\", and \"Crumb\".\nIn 2002, photojournalist John Bassett McCleary published a 650-page, 6,000-entry unabridged slang dictionary devoted to the language of the hippies titled \"The Hippie Dictionary: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the 1960s and 1970s\". The book was revised and expanded to 700 pages in 2004. McCleary believes that the hippie counterculture added a significant number of words to the English language by borrowing from the lexicon of the Beat Generation, through the hippies' shortening of beatnik words and then popularizing their usage. \nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For the findings of a study to be reproducible means that results obtained by an experiment or an observational study or in a statistical analysis of a data set should be achieved again with a high degree of reliability when the study is replicated. There are different kinds of replication but typically replication studies involve different researchers using the same methodology. Only after one or several such successful replications should a result be recognized as scientific knowledge.\nHistory.\nThe first to stress the importance of reproducibility in science was the Anglo-Irish chemist Robert Boyle, in England in the 17th century. Boyle's air pump was designed to generate and study vacuum, which at the time was a very controversial concept. Indeed, distinguished philosophers such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Thomas Hobbes denied the very possibility of vacuum existence. Historians of science Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, in their 1985 book \"Leviathan and the Air-Pump\", describe the debate between Boyle and Hobbes, ostensibly over the nature of vacuum, as fundamentally an argument about how useful knowledge should be gained. Boyle, a pioneer of the experimental method, maintained that the foundations of knowledge should be constituted by experimentally produced facts, which can be made believable to a scientific community by their reproducibility. By repeating the same experiment over and over again, Boyle argued, the certainty of fact will emerge.\nThe air pump, which in the 17th century was a complicated and expensive apparatus to build, also led to one of the first documented disputes over the reproducibility of a particular scientific phenomenon. In the 1660s, the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens built his own air pump in Amsterdam, the first one outside the direct management of Boyle and his assistant at the time Robert Hooke. Huygens reported an effect he termed \"anomalous suspension\", in which water appeared to levitate in a glass jar inside his air pump (in fact suspended over an air bubble), but Boyle and Hooke could not replicate this phenomenon in their own pumps. As Shapin and Schaffer describe, \"it became clear that unless the phenomenon could be produced in England with one of the two pumps available, then no one in England would accept the claims Huygens had made, or his competence in working the pump\". Huygens was finally invited to England in 1663, and under his personal guidance Hooke was able to replicate anomalous suspension of water. Following this Huygens was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society. However, Shapin and Schaffer also note that \"the accomplishment of replication was dependent on contingent acts of judgment. One cannot write down a formula saying when replication was or was not achieved\".\nThe philosopher of science Karl Popper noted briefly in his famous 1934 book \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\" that \"non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science\". The statistician Ronald Fisher wrote in his 1935 book \"The Design of Experiments\", which set the foundations for the modern scientific practice of hypothesis testing and statistical significance, that \"we may say that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when we know how to conduct an experiment which will rarely fail to give us statistically significant results\". Such assertions express a common dogma in modern science that reproducibility is a necessary condition (although not necessarily sufficient) for establishing a scientific fact, and in practice for establishing scientific authority in any field of knowledge. However, as noted above by Shapin and Schaffer, this dogma is not well-formulated quantitatively, such as statistical significance for instance, and therefore it is not explicitly established how many times must a fact be replicated to be considered reproducible.\nTerminology.\n\"Replicability\" and \"repeatability\" are related terms broadly or loosely synonymous with reproducibility (for example, among the general public), but they are often usefully differentiated in more precise senses, as follows.\nTwo major steps are naturally distinguished in connection with reproducibility of experimental or observational studies: when new data are obtained in the attempt to achieve it, the term \"replicability\" is often used, and the new study is a \"replication\" or \"replicate\" of the original one. Obtaining the same results when analyzing the data set of the original study again with the same procedures, many authors use the term \"reproducibility\" in a narrow, technical sense coming from its use in computational research. \"Repeatability\" is related to the \"repetition\" of the experiment within the same study by the same researchers. Reproducibility in the original, wide sense is only acknowledged if a replication performed by an \"independent researcher team\" is successful.\nThe terms reproducibility and replicability sometimes appear even in the scientific literature with reversed meaning, as different research fields settled on their own definitions for the same terms.\nMeasures of reproducibility and repeatability.\nIn chemistry, the terms reproducibility and repeatability are used with a specific quantitative meaning. In inter-laboratory experiments, a concentration or other quantity of a chemical substance is measured repeatedly in different laboratories to assess the variability of the measurements. Then, the standard deviation of the difference between two values obtained within the same laboratory is called repeatability. The standard deviation for the difference between two measurement from different laboratories is called \"reproducibility\".\nThese measures are related to the more general concept of variance components in metrology.\nReproducible research.\nReproducible research method.\nThe term \"reproducible research\" refers to the idea that scientific results should be documented in such a way that their deduction is fully transparent. This requires a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the data\nand making the full dataset and the code to calculate the results easily accessible.\nThis is the essential part of open science.\nTo make any research project computationally reproducible, general practice involves all data and files being clearly separated, labelled, and documented. All operations should be fully documented and automated as much as practicable, avoiding manual intervention where feasible. The workflow should be designed as a sequence of smaller steps that are combined so that the intermediate outputs from one step directly feed as inputs into the next step. Version control should be used as it lets the history of the project be easily reviewed and allows for the documenting and tracking of changes in a transparent manner.\nA basic workflow for reproducible research involves data acquisition, data processing and data analysis. Data acquisition primarily consists of obtaining primary data from a primary source such as surveys, field observations, experimental research, or obtaining data from an existing source. Data processing involves the processing and review of the raw data collected in the first stage, and includes data entry, data manipulation and filtering and may be done using software. The data should be digitized and prepared for data analysis. Data may be analysed with the use of software to interpret or visualise statistics or data to produce the desired results of the research such as quantitative results including figures and tables. The use of software and automation enhances the reproducibility of research methods.\nThere are systems that facilitate such documentation, like the R Markdown language\nor the Jupyter notebook.\nThe Open Science Framework provides a platform and useful tools to support reproducible research.\nReproducible research in practice.\nPsychology has seen a renewal of internal concerns about irreproducible results (see the entry on replicability crisis for empirical results on success rates of replications). Researchers showed in a 2006 study that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychological Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a six-month period. In a follow-up study published in 2015, it was found that 246 out of 394 contacted authors of papers in APA journals did not share their data upon request (62%). In a 2012 paper, it was suggested that researchers should publish data along with their works, and a dataset was released alongside as a demonstration. In 2017, an article published in \"Scientific Data\" suggested that this may not be sufficient and that the whole analysis context should be disclosed.\nIn economics, concerns have been raised in relation to the credibility and reliability of published research. In other sciences, reproducibility is regarded as fundamental and is often a prerequisite to research being published, however in economic sciences it is not seen as a priority of the greatest importance. Most peer-reviewed economic journals do not take any substantive measures to ensure that published results are reproducible, however, the top economics journals have been moving to adopt mandatory data and code archives. There is low or no incentives for researchers to share their data, and authors would have to bear the costs of compiling data into reusable forms. Economic research is often not reproducible as only a portion of journals have adequate disclosure policies for datasets and program code, and even if they do, authors frequently do not comply with them or they are not enforced by the publisher. A Study of 599 articles published in 37 peer-reviewed journals revealed that while some journals have achieved significant compliance rates, significant portion have only partially complied, or not complied at all. On an article level, the average compliance rate was 47.5%; and on a journal level, the average compliance rate was 38%, ranging from 13% to 99%.\nA 2018 study published in the journal \"PLOS ONE\" found that 14.4% of a sample of public health statistics researchers had shared their data or code or both.\nThere have been initiatives to improve reporting and hence reproducibility in the medical literature for many years, beginning with the CONSORT initiative, which is now part of a wider initiative, the EQUATOR Network.\nThis group has recently turned its attention to how better reporting might reduce waste in research, especially biomedical research.\nReproducible research is key to new discoveries in pharmacology. A Phase I discovery will be followed by Phase II reproductions as a drug develops towards commercial production. In recent decades Phase II success has fallen from 28% to 18%. A 2011 study found that 65% of medical studies were inconsistent when re-tested, and only 6% were completely reproducible.\nSome efforts have been made to increase replicability beyond the social and biomedical sciences. Studies in the humanities tend to rely more on expertise and hermeneutics which may make replicability more difficult. Nonetheless, some efforts have been made to call for more transparency and documentation in the humanities.\nNoteworthy irreproducible results.\nHideyo Noguchi became famous for correctly identifying the bacterial agent of syphilis, but also claimed that he could culture this agent in his laboratory. Nobody else has been able to produce this latter result.\nIn March 1989, University of Utah chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann reported the production of excess heat that could only be explained by a nuclear process (\"cold fusion\"). The report was astounding given the simplicity of the equipment: it was essentially an electrolysis cell containing heavy water and a palladium cathode which rapidly absorbed the deuterium produced during electrolysis. The news media reported on the experiments widely, and it was a front-page item on many newspapers around the world (see science by press conference). Over the next several months others tried to replicate the experiment, but were unsuccessful.\nNikola Tesla claimed as early as 1899 to have used a high frequency current to light gas-filled lamps from over away without using wires. In 1904 he built Wardenclyffe Tower on Long Island to demonstrate means to send and receive power without connecting wires. The facility was never fully operational and was not completed due to economic problems, so no attempt to reproduce his first result was ever carried out.\nOther examples which contrary evidence has refuted the original claim:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The clocks are used in games where the time is allocated between two parties. The purpose is to keep track of the total time each party takes and prevent delays. Parties may take more or less time over any individual move. \nChess clocks were first used extensively in tournament chess, beginning with a competition at the London 1883 tournament. They are often called game clocks, as their use has since spread to tournament Scrabble, shogi, Go, and nearly every competitive two-player board game, as well as other types of games. Various designs exist for chess clocks and different methods of time control may be employed on the clocks, with \"sudden death\" being the simplest.\nDescription.\nA chess clock consists of two adjacent clocks with buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, so that the two clocks never run simultaneously. The devices are used in chess and other two-player games where the players move in turn. The purpose is to keep track of the total time each player takes for their own moves, and ensure that neither player overly delays the game.\nInvented by Thomas Bright Wilson of Manchester Chess Club, the clocks were first used during competition at the London 1883 tournament. Chess clocks were first used extensively in tournament chess, and are often called \"game clocks\". Their use has since spread to tournament Scrabble, shogi, Go, and nearly every competitive two-player board game, as well as other types of games. They have also been used in some legal settings where each side or party is allotted a specific amount of time for arguments.\nDesigns.\nAnalog game clocks.\nAnalog clocks are equipped with a \"flag\" that falls to indicate the exact moment the player's time has expired. Analog clocks use mechanical buttons. Pressing the button on one player's side physically stops the movement of that player's clock and releases the hold on the opponent's.\nThe drawbacks of the mechanical clocks include accuracy and matching of the two clocks, and matching of the indicators (flags) of time expiration. Additional time cannot easily be added for more complex time controls, especially those that call for an increment or delay on every move, such as some forms of byoyomi.\nEarly development of digital game clocks.\nIn 1973, to address the issues with analog clocks, Bruce Cheney, a Cornell University electrical engineering (EE) student and chess player, created the first digital chess clock as a project for an undergraduate EE course. Typical of most inventions, it was crude compared to the products on the market many years later and was limited by the technology that existed at the time. For example, the display was implemented via red LEDs, which required significant power and, as a result, the clock had to be plugged into a wall outlet. The high cost of LEDs at the time meant that only one set of digits could be displayed: that of the player whose turn it was to move. This meant that each player's time had to be multiplexed to the display when their time was running. In 1973, LSI chips were not readily or cheaply available, so all the multiplexing and logic was enabled using chips consisting of four two-input TTL NAND gates, resulting in excessive power consumption. Being plugged into the wall is obviously a major drawback, but had one advantage: the timebase for the clock was driven off a rectified version of the alternating current mains frequency. Each player had a separate counter and, in a parallel to the original mechanical architecture, one player's counter was disabled while the other's was running. The clock only had one mode: time ran forward. It could be reset, but not set. It did not count the number of moves. But it successfully addressed the original goals of the project (accurate and matched timing).\nThe first commercially available digital chess clock was patented in 1975 by Joseph Meshi and Jeffrey R. Ponsor. They named it the Micromate-80. There was only one made and this was tested by chess players in multiple tournaments. Three years later a much-improved Micromate-180 was produced alongside Meshi's MBA thesis, \"Demand Analysis for a New Product (The Digital Chess Clock)\", at San Diego State University, while Meshi and Ponsor continued to develop digital gaming.\nFischer clock and related designs.\nDigital clocks and Internet gaming have spurred a wave of experimentation with more varied and complex time controls than the traditional standards. Time control is commonly used in modern chess in many different methodologies. One particularly notable development, which has gained quite wide acceptance in chess, was proposed by former world champion Bobby Fischer, who in 1988 filed for US patent 4,884,255 (awarded in 1989) for a new type of digital chess clock. Fischer's digital clock gave each player a fixed period of time at the start of the game and then added a small amount after each move. Joseph Meshi called this \"Accumulation\" as it was a main feature of his patented Micromate-180 (US Patent 4,247,925 1978).\nThe increment time control was first used in the privately organised 1992 Fischer\u2013Spassky match, and quickly became popular in the wider chess world, being subsequently used in the FIDE World Chess Championship 1998. Nowadays most top level tournaments and tournaments outside the United States use Fischer's system. An increasing number of lower level tournaments in the US are also starting to use Fischer's system. Other aspects of Fischer's patent, such as a synthesized voice announcing how much time the players have, thus eliminating the need for them to keep looking at the clock, have not been adopted.\nOn March 10, 1994, a patent application was filed by inventors Frank A. Camaratta Jr. of Huntsville, Alabama, and William Goichberg of Salisbury Mills, New York, for a game timer especially suitable for playing the game of chess, which employed a (simple) \"delay\" feature. The game timer provides, among other features, a user-definable delay between the time the activation button is pressed and the time that the activated clock actually begins to count down. United States Patent 5,420,830 was issued on May 10, 1995, and subsequently assigned to the United States Chess Federation by the inventors. As with the Fischer clock, the benefit of the delay clock is to reduce the likelihood that a player with positional or material superiority will lose a match solely because of the expiration of time on that player's time clock. In the United States, delay is still widely used, but increment is becoming more popular.\nTiming methods.\nSudden death: The simplest time control is \"sudden death\", in which players must make a predetermined number of moves in a certain amount of time or forfeit the game immediately. A particularly popular variant is blitz chess, in which each player is given a short time, such as five minutes, on the clock in which to play the entire game.\nX moves per Y minutes: in longer time control games, time control is usually specified in a certain number of moves in a certain time. Traditionally the first time control is at move 40. At the World Chess Championship 1986, for instance, the time control was 40 moves in 2\u00bd hours, and 16 moves per hour thereafter. Sometimes, after a certain move, it reverts to sudden death; for instance, 90 minutes for the first 40 moves, then an extra 30 minutes for each player for the rest of the game (ensuring the maximum game length is 4 hours: 2 hours maximum for each player).\nIncrement (also known as Bonus and Fischer since former World Chess Champion Bobby Fischer patented this timing method): a specified amount of time is added to the player's main time each move, unless the player's main time ran out before they completed their move. For example, if the time control is 90+30 (ninety minutes of main time per player with a thirty-second increment each move), each player gets an additional thirty seconds added to their main time for each move, unless the player's main time ran out first. Under FIDE and US Chess rules, the increment is applied to the first move as well. For example, for 3+2 each player starts with three minutes and two seconds on the first move. Not all digital clocks automatically give the increment for move one and thus for those that don't, the increment time has to be added manually to the main time so each player gets the increment for move one.\nIncrement can also begin later than move 1. For instance, at the World Chess Championship 2024, the time control was 120 minutes per side for the first 40 moves, and an extra 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move starting from move 41. \nBronstein delay (named after Grandmaster David Bronstein who invented this timing method): this timing method adds time but, unlike Increment, the maximum amount of time is not always added. If a player expends more than the specified delay then the entire delay is added to the player's clock, but if a player moves faster than the delay, only the exact amount of time expended by the player is added. For example, if the delay is ten seconds and a player uses ten or more seconds for a move, ten seconds is added after they complete their move. If the player uses five seconds for a move, five seconds is added after they complete their move. This ensures that the main time left on the clock can never increase even if a player makes fast moves. As with Increment, the delay time is applied to the first move under FIDE and US Chess rules.\nSimple delay (also known as US delay): with this timing method, the clock waits for the delay period each move before the player's main time starts counting down. For example, if the delay is ten seconds, the clock waits for ten seconds each move before the main time starts counting down.\nBronstein delay and Simple delay are very similar, but not equal. Mathematically, Bronstein delay and Simple delay are identical; the amount of time allotted to each player is equivalent at all stages of the game. For this reason, the two delays are interchangeable in the FIDE laws of chess. In practice, however, Bronstein delay and Simple delay display time differently. In Bronstein delay, the amount of time is added \"after\" the move has been made; this distinction may be crucial when a player is running out of time. \nThe advantage of Bronstein delay is that a player can always quickly see exactly how much time they have for their next move without having to mentally add the main and delay time. The advantage of Simple delay is that a player can always tell whether the time that is counting down is the delay time or the main time. For example, in a game with a 5-second delay, when a player presses their clock with 1 second remaining, the clock will display with 1 second remaining, and the 5-second delay is counted separately on their next turn. In Bronstein, the 5 seconds are immediately added, and the clock will display 6 seconds. Simple delay is the form of delay most often used in the US, while Bronstein delay is the form of delay most often used in most other countries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1970 as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale Industrielle A\u00e9rospatiale (lit.\u2009'National Aerospace Industrial Company') through the merger of three state-owned aerospace firms: Nord Aviation, SEREB, and Sud Aviation.\nDuring its existence, A\u00e9rospatiale was one of the world's largest aerospace companies. It was Europe's biggest general aeronautics manufacturer and its leading exporter in the industry. Its products included civilian and military aircraft and helicopters, launch vehicles and satellites, as well as weapon systems ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles to portable anti-tank guided missiles. The company was also a key participant in several high-profile multinational programs, including the Concorde supersonic airliner, the Ariane series of launch vehicles, and the Airbus A300, the world\u2019s first twin-engined wide-body airliner.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the ensuing \"peace dividend\", much of the European aerospace and defence industry began to consolidate. A\u00e9rospatiale's breakup was accelerated by the French government's efforts to privatize state-owned companies. In 1992, A\u00e9rospatiale and Germany's DASA each spun off their helicopter divisions, which merged to form the Eurocopter Group\u2014later renamed Airbus Helicopters\u2014with the two parent companies holding 70% and 30% stakes, respectively. In 1999, A\u00e9rospatiale\u2019s satellite manufacturing division was acquired by Alcatel to form Alcatel Space, later renamed Thales Alenia Space.\nIn October 1999, A\u00e9rospatiale\u2019s remaining assets were merged with the aerospace, defence, and telecommunications division of the French conglomerate Matra. The merger both consolidated the French aerospace sector and reduced the French government\u2019s shareholding in preparation for a larger consolidation. The merged company, A\u00e9rospatiale-Matra, then joined with Germany\u2019s DASA and Spain's CASA on 10 July 2000 to form the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), which was later rebranded Airbus.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nIn 1970, \"A\u00e9rospatiale\" was created under the name Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale Industrielle A\u00e9rospatiale as a result of the merger of several French state-owned companies - Sud Aviation, Nord Aviation and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9tude et de r\u00e9alisation d'engins balistiques (SEREB). The newly formed entity was the largest aerospace company in France. From the onset, the French government owned a controlling stake in A\u00e9rospatiale; at one stage, a 97 per cent ownership of the company was held by the government.\nIn 1971, A\u00e9rospatiale was managed by the French industrialist Henri Ziegler; that same year, the firm's North American marketing and sales arm, which had previously operated under the trading name of the \"French Aerospace Corporation\", was officially rebranded as the \"European Aerospace Corporation\", which was intended to better reflect A\u00e9rospatiale's increasing focus on collaborative efforts with its European partners.\nMajor activities.\nMany of A\u00e9rospatiale's initial programmes were holdovers from its predecessors, particularly those of Sud Aviation. Perhaps the most high-profile of these programmes was Concorde, a joint French-British attempt to develop and market a supersonic commercial airliner. Initial work on this project had begun at Sud Aviation and the British Aircraft Corporation, its British counterpart. The engines for Concorde were also developed as a joint Anglo-French effort between SNECMA and Bristol Siddeley. However, the programme was highly politicised and encountered considerable cost overruns and delays. Ultimately, it was negatively affected equally by bad political decisions and an oil crisis in the 1970s; thus, only two airlines purchased Concorde.\nA\u00e9rospatiale's senior management were keen to avoid the mistakes of the Concorde program. Their next major effort would be a transnational consortium with British Aerospace and the West German's aircraft company Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB). The British would eventually withdraw from the discussions, but the French and West Germans would proceed and form Airbus Industrie GIE. It was established with the purpose of building a twin-engined widebody airliner, known as the A300. At first, it was difficult to achieve sales and the outlook for the A300 seemed negative. However, A\u00e9rospatiale continued to manufacture the airliner without orders, as it could not reasonably cut back production as French law required that laid-off employees were to receive 90 per cent of their pay for a year as well as to retain their health benefits throughout.\nSales of the A300 picked up and the type eventually became a major commercial success, subsequently driving both the American Lockheed L-1011 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 from the market due to its cheaper operating model. On the back of this success, further airliners would be produced under the Airbus brand and the company would become a world leader in the field of large commercial aircraft during the 1990s.\nA\u00e9rospatiale played a leading role in the development of the European space sector. During the 1960s, Sud Aviation had been involved in a multinational European programme to produce the Europa space launch vehicle, this being a three-stage rocket with the separate stages being manufactured in Britain, France, and Germany respectively. However, all of the flight tests conducted were failures; the programme's misfortune has been attributed to there being no central authority responsible for operations. This came as a result of the issue of workshare becoming highly politicized.\nWhen A\u00e9rospatiale stepped in, in 1973, it was determined not to repeat the mistakes of Europa. The company proposed to build a new heavy launch vehicle, which would later be called the Ariane, to take the place of Europa. While other European nations were invited to participate, it would be French officials who would hold primary responsibility, and thus, make the most important decisions. This approach was agreed upon with several other nations; during 1979.\nAriane was an immediate success, allowing the French to gain a strong advantage over the United States, which had centred its efforts on the Space Shuttle. However, the \"Challenger\" disaster during 1986 showed that it was too complex for routine use as a satellite launch platform. A\u00e9rospatiale went on to develop more capable versions of the Ariane, which took much of the business of space launches away from the Americans during the 1990s.\nPrivatisation and mergers.\nIn 1992, A\u00e9rospatiale and the German defense company DaimlerBenz Aerospace AG (DASA) combined their respective helicopter divisions together to form the Eurocopter Group; ownership of this new entity was shared (70% and 30% respectively) between the two parent companies.\nDuring the late 1990s, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Plural Left government initiated a policy towards the privatization of A\u00e9rospatiale. In 1999, the majority of A\u00e9rospatiale, except for the satellites activities, merged with French conglomerate Matra's defense wing, Matra Haute Technologie, to form A\u00e9rospatiale-Matra. \nOn 10 July 2000, A\u00e9rospatiale-Matra merged with DASA and Spanish aviation company Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA and to form the multinational European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS). EADS would later rebrand itself as Airbus, taking the name of its commercial aircraft division, its primary business.\nDuring 2001, A\u00e9rospatiale-Matra's missile division underwent a further merger with Anglo-French outfit Matra BAe Dynamics and the missile division of Alenia Marconi Systems to form the multinational MBDA entity.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47660", "revid": "50980465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47660", "title": "Espresso", "text": "Type of strong coffee\nEspresso (, ) is a concentrated form of coffee produced by forcing hot water under high pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Originating in Italy, espresso has become one of the most popular coffee-brewing methods worldwide. It is characterized by its small serving size, typically 25\u201330 ml, and its distinctive layers: a dark body topped with a lighter-colored foam called \"crema\".\nEspresso machines use pressure to extract a highly concentrated coffee with a complex flavor profile in a short time, usually 25\u201330 seconds. The result is a beverage with a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids than regular drip coffee, giving espresso its characteristic body and intensity. While espresso contains more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, its typical serving size results in less caffeine per serving compared to larger drinks such as drip coffee.\nEspresso serves as the base for other coffee drinks, including cappuccino, caff\u00e8 latte, and americano. It can be made with various types of coffee beans and roast levels, allowing for a wide range of flavors and strengths, despite the widespread myth that it is made with dark-roast coffee beans. The quality of an espresso is influenced by factors such as the grind size, water temperature, pressure, and the barista's skill in tamping (packing and leveling) the coffee grounds.\nThe cultural significance of espresso extends beyond its consumption, playing a central role in coffee shop culture and the third-wave coffee movement, which emphasizes artisanal production and high-quality beans.\nEtymology and spelling.\nAlthough some English dictionaries translate \"espresso\" as 'pressed-out', the word also conveys the sense of 'expressly for you' and 'quickly':\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The words \"express\", \"expres\" and \"espresso\" each have several meanings in English, French and Italian. The first meaning is to do with the idea of \"expressing\" (\"pressing out of\") or squeezing the flavour from the coffee using the pressure of the steam. The second meaning is to do with speed, as in a train. Finally there is the notion of doing something \"expressly\" for a person\u00a0... The first Bezzera and Pavoni espresso machines in 1906 took 45 seconds to make a cup of coffee, one at a time, expressly for you.\nModern espresso, using hot water under pressure, as pioneered by Gaggia in the 1940s, was originally called \"crema caff\u00e8\" (lit.\u2009'cream coffee'), as seen on old Gaggia machines, due to the crema.\nEnglish speakers in America and England have spelled and pronounced \"espresso\" as \"expresso\" since at least the 1940s. \"Dictionary.com\" attributes the origin to ex- being a more common way that words start in English, making pronunciation easier, and several sources speculate an association between the drink and the word \"express\" may have contributed to its uptake. Outside of the Anglosphere, \"expresso\" is commonly used in France, Portugal and Spain. In the 1970s, the spelling \"espresso\" gained prominence, and by 1996, the third edition of Fowler's \"Modern English Usage\" described \"expresso\" as \"entirely driven out\". As of 2016, the Oxford Dictionary online entry for \"espresso\" described the alternate spelling as \"common\".\nItaly uses the term \"espresso\", substituting \"s\" for most \"x\" letters in Latin-root words, with the term deriving from the past participle of the Italian verb \"esprimere\", itself derived from the Latin \"exprimere\", which means 'to express', and refers to the process by which hot water is forced under pressure through ground coffee; \"x\" is not considered part of the standard Italian alphabet. Italians commonly refer to espresso simply as \"caff\u00e8\" (lit.\u2009'coffee'), espresso being the ordinary coffee to order.\nAccording to \"Slate\" magazine, most commentary on whether \"expresso\" should be considered correct takes the negative. Such sources include \"Garner's Modern American Usage\" and Oxford Dictionaries online, who defer to how \"espresso\" is spelled in Italy. Among some of these opponents, its use is considered a faux pas, and a mark of lacking sophistication. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" and \"Merriam-Webster\" call it a variant spelling.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nCoffee arrived in Italy in the 16th century, and the first recorded coffee houses followed a century later. By the mid-19th century, coffee was drunk throughout Italy, as drip coffee in homes and as infused coffee in caf\u00e9s. The drink's popularity expanded following the 1890s as economic depression ended, and businesses responded by working to make their brewing processes more efficient. This coincided with broader efforts by manufacturers across Europe that had been underway since the mid-19th century. These manufacturers were motivated to reduce wait times for caf\u00e9 patrons, and wanted to produce machines that could brew coffee in large batches to be portioned later.\nOne of these machines was created by Angelo Moriondo, an inventor from Turin. In 1884, Moriondo patented a coffee machine that used steam to propel water through coffee grounds, which was \"almost certainly the first Italian bar machine that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee\". According to Bersten, this made Moriondo \"certainly one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso machine, if not the earliest\". Unlike the modern espresso machine, it brewed in bulk, rather than in individual servings.\nBezzera's invention.\nA machine that could brew individual servings came in the new century. In 1901, the inventor Luigi Bezzera of Milan filed a patent for his coffee maker. This machine contained a boiler, which when heated generated steam that would direct water through one of several heads, cooled on its path to a temperature considered more suitable for brewing. To the heads, a portafilter containing compressed coffee could be attached, producing coffee in individual portions, that is, 'expressly' for the customer.\nIn 1903, another Milanese man, Desiderio Pavoni, purchased Bezzera's patents. He modified the design by adding a mechanism to release pressure and in 1905 began to sell machines. These are generally held to be the first commercial espresso machines. Although early espresso machines could produce coffee at a rate of 1,000 an hour, the steam and high temperatures gave the drinks a black appearance and a burnt, bitter taste. The pressure they generated was around , too little to produce a drink that would be considered espresso today, and they lacked the foam \"crema\". Shots were longer and took more time to pull\u2014almost a minute, around twice that of the modern espresso.\nIn 1906, Bezzera and Pavoni attended the World Fair Expo in Milan, selling their respective machines. During the following decade, the market for espresso was limited to Milan. This gradually expanded, helped by the popularity of American-style bars which permitted coffee served standing rather than sitting, and by World War I, when young Italian men who were given coffee as rations took up a daily habit. Still, for the first thirty years, few establishments could afford the expensive machines, and Pavoni and two other manufacturers\u2014Victoria Arduino in Turin and San Marco in Udine\u2014produced most machines for the small Italian market, relying on exports across Europe to remain profitable.\nThe machine continued to develop over its first decades. Design shifted from one of austerity to opulence. With their Art Deco appearance, by the 1920s espresso machines were held out popularly in Italy to represent domestic modernity, a trend driven in part by the marketing efforts of Pier Teresio Arduino of Victoria Arduino. Machines also developed in other respects: they shrank, and their energy source moved from gas to electricity. The uptake of coffee continued, peaking in 1929, and in the 1930s a culture of drinking espresso outside the home surpassed the earlier habit of drinking a basic coffee at home. After its peak, coffee consumption declined as fascists banned luxury items, and the Great Depression impacted consumption. This culminated in 1941, when Italy lost its African territories and all imports of coffee were halted.\nAchieving higher pressures.\nFor decades, manufacturers endeavoured to produce a machine that could use higher pressures without the resulting coffee tasting burned. Arduino tried, unsuccessfully, to incorporate air pumps and screw pistons. In 1935 in Trieste, east of Milan, Francesco Illy registered a patent for the Illetta, a machine that used compressed air rather than steam. Three years later in Milan, Achille Gaggia registered a patent to do the same, employing a hand-pulled, rotating piston.\nIn 1947, Gaggia further developed the piston mechanism. The new machines contained much smaller boilers, which generated steam to push water into a receptacle. These were a standardized size, producing a coffee of a standardized size. In the receptacle, a lever-operated piston containing gears and a spring further pressurized the water up to 12 atmospheres. This water was shot through a coffee puck, producing a foam (\"crema\") out of essential oils and colloids. Gaggia began selling these the following year, using advertising to emphasize the lack of steam and the presence of crema. For the latter, the drink was marketed under the name . These are typically seen as the first modern espresso machines.\nOver the next decade, workshops in Milan continued to innovate new designs. One of these came from the Cimbali company, which replaced springs with hydraulics. Like Gaggia, they attempted to market the coffee under a new name\u2014this time, . The major development came in 1961 by Ernesto Valente with the invention of the \"Faema E61\". Valente had been the original manufacturer of Gaggia's 1948 machine, but their business agreement ended after disagreement over what market should be targeted: Gaggia saw espresso machines as a niche, expensive product for establishments that could afford them, while Valente saw an opportunity for a broad market with cheap machines.\nIn the \"Faema E61\", operation was mechanized, using an on-off switch to control an electric pump that pressurized water to . Water was drawn directly from the plumbing, pressurized, and sent through a copper pipe inside a boiler. As it travelled, the water was maintained at a temperature considered by the manufacturers to be ideal for brewing. The new machine was cheap, with a \"pop\" design, and it came as much of Italy gained electricity for the first time. For the barista, there was no longer a need to pause between espressos as the boiler came back to temperature, and the horizontal boiler permitted eye-level conversation with customers. \nItalians also spread espresso culture into their East African colonies, Italian Somalia and Italian Eritrea.\nCharacteristics.\nEspresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, with a viscosity similar to that of warm honey. This is due to the higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids and the crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency). As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated.\nEspresso contains more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, but as its usual serving size of 25\u201330 ml (1 US oz) is much smaller than other coffee drinks, the overall caffeine content of a single \"serving\" of espresso is generally lower than that of other coffees. While the exact caffeine content of any coffee drink will vary, a typical serving of espresso contains approximately 65 milligrams of caffeine, but a typical serving of drip coffee contains 150\u2013200\u00a0mg of caffeine.\nUnlike other coffee drinks, an espresso contains three phases: an emulsion of oil droplets, suspended solids, and a layer of gas bubbles or foam. In the mouth, the dispersed oil droplets are perceived as creamy, and they contibute to what is known as the drink's \"body\". These droplets preserve some aromatic compounds that are lost to the air in other brewing methods.\nThe crema, a layer of dense foam that appears at the top of the drink, is unique to espresso. It is made up of emulsified oils in the ground coffee turned into a colloid, which does not occur in other brewing methods. Crema is produced when water placed under very high pressure dissolves more carbon dioxide, a gas present inside the coffee that is produced during the roasting process.\nProcess.\nEspresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through finely ground compacted coffee. There is no universal standard defining the process of extracting espresso, but several institutions have published definitions that restrict the amount and type of ground coffee used, the temperature and pressure of the water, and the rate of extraction. Typically, an espresso is made using an espresso machine.\nThe act of producing a shot of espresso is often called \"pulling\" a shot, originating from lever espresso machines, with which a barista pulls down a handle attached to a spring-loaded piston, which forces hot water through the coffee at high pressure. However, it is more common for an electric pump to generate the pressure.\nTamping down the coffee promotes the water's even penetration through the grounds. This process produces a thicker beverage by extracting both solid and dissolved components.\nThe technical parameters outlined by the Italian Espresso National Institute for making a \"certified Italian espresso\" are:\nRoasts.\nAny bean or roasting level can be used to produce authentic espresso. For example, in southern Italy, a darker roast is generally preferred. Farther north, the trend moves toward slightly lighter roasts, while outside Italy a wide range is popular.\nVariables.\nThe main variables in a shot of espresso are the \"size\" and \"length\". This terminology is standardized, but the precise sizes and proportions vary substantially.\nCaf\u00e9s may have a standardized shot (size and length), such as \"triple ristretto\", only varying the number of shots in espresso-based drinks such as caff\u00e8 latte, but not changing the extraction.\nThe size can be a single, double or triple, using a proportional amount of ground coffee, roughly 7, 14, and 21\u00a0grams; correspondingly sized filter baskets are used. The Italian multiplier term \"doppio\" is often used for a double, with \"solo\" and \"triplo\" being more rarely used for singles and triples. The single shot is the traditional shot size, being the maximum that could easily be pulled on a lever machine. Single baskets are sharply tapered or stepped down in diameter to provide comparable depth to the double baskets and, therefore, comparable resistance to water pressure. Most double baskets are gently tapered (the \"Faema model\"), while others, such as the La Marzocco, have straight sides.\nTriple baskets are normally straight-sided. Portafilters will often come with two spouts, usually closely spaced, and a double-size basket. Each spout can optionally dispense into a separate cup, yielding two \"solo\"-size (but doppio-brewed) shots, or into a single cup (hence the close spacing). True \"solo\" shots are rare, with a single shot in a caf\u00e9 generally being half of a doppio shot. In espresso-based drinks in America, particularly larger milk-based drinks, a drink with three or four shots of espresso will be called \"triple\" or \"quad\", respectively.\nThe length of the shot can be ristretto (or \"stretto\") (reduced), \"normale\" or standard (normal) or lungo (long): these may correspond to a smaller or larger drink with the same amount of ground coffee and same level of extraction or to different length of extraction. Proportions vary, and the volume (and low density) of crema makes volume-based comparisons difficult (precise measurement uses the mass of the drink). Typically, ristretto is half the volume of \"normale\", and lungo is double to triple the \"normale\" volume. For a double shot (14 grams of dry coffee), a \"normale\" uses about 60 ml of water. A double ristretto, a common form associated with espresso, uses half the amount of water, about 30 ml. Ristretto, \"normale\", and lungo may not simply be the same shot stopped at different times (which could result in an under- or over-extracted shot), but have the grind adjusted (finer for ristretto, coarser for lungo) to achieve the target volume. A significantly longer shot is the \"caff\u00e8 crema\", which is longer than a lungo, ranging in size from , and brewed in the same way, with a coarser grind. Passing too much water through the ground coffee can add other, potentially unpleasant flavors to the espresso.\nMachines.\nHome espresso machines have increased in popularity with the general rise of interest in espresso. Today, a wide range of home espresso equipment can be found in kitchen and appliance stores, online vendors, and department stores. The first espresso machine for home use was the Gaggia Gilda. Soon afterwards, similar machines such as the Faema Faemina, FE-AR La Peppina, and VAM Caravel followed suit, with similar form factors and operational principles.\nThese machines still have a small but dedicated share of fans. Until the advent of the first small electrical pump-based espresso machines, such as the Gaggia Baby and Quickmill 810, home espresso machines were not widely adopted. In recent years, the increased availability of convenient countertop fully automatic home espresso makers and pod-based espresso serving systems has increased the quantity of espresso consumed at home. The popularity of home espresso making parallels the increase of home coffee roasting. Some amateurs pursue both home roasting coffee and making espresso.\nNutrition.\nIn a 100 ml (grams, 3.5 oz) reference amount, espresso has significant levels of dietary mineral, magnesium, B vitamins, niacin, and riboflavin, and around 212\u00a0mg of caffeine per 100 grams of liquid brewed coffee (table).\nEspresso-based drinks.\nWhen it is not served by itself, espresso is frequently blended, often with milk\u2014steamed (without significant foam), wet foamed (microfoam) and dry foamed\u2014or hot water. Several are listed below; for reference, espresso typically has a volume between .\nOther variants include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Antonov's particular expertise is in the fields of very large aeroplanes and aeroplanes using unprepared runways. Antonov (model prefix \"An-\") has built a total of approximately 22,000 aircraft, and thousands of its planes are operating in the former Soviet Union and in developing countries.\nAntonov Company is a state-owned commercial company originally established in Novosibirsk, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). In 1952, the company relocated to Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, then part of the Soviet Union. On 12 May 2015, it was transferred from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade to the Ukroboronprom (Ukrainian Defense Industry).\nIn June 2016, Ukraine's major state-owned arms manufacturer Ukroboronprom announced the creation of the Ukrainian Aircraft Corporation within its structure, to combine all aircraft manufacturing enterprises in Ukraine.\nHistory.\nSoviet era.\nFoundation and relocation.\nThe company was established in 1946 at the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association as the top-secret Soviet Research and Design Bureau No. 153 (OKB-153). It was headed by Oleg Antonov and specialised in turboprop military transport aircraft. The task was to create an agricultural aircraft CX-1 (An-2), the first flight of which occurred on 31 August 1947. The An-2 biplane was a major achievement of this period, with hundreds of these aircraft still operating as of 2013. In addition to this biplane and its modifications, a small series of gliders A-9 and A-10 were created and built in the pilot production in Novosibirsk. In 1952, the Bureau was relocated to Kyiv, a city with a rich aviation history and an aircraft-manufacturing infrastructure restored after the destruction caused by World War II.\nFirst serial aircraft and expansion.\nThe 1957 introduction of the An-10/An-12 family of mid-range turboprop aeroplanes began the successful production of thousands of these aircraft. Their use for both heavy combat and civilian purposes around the globe continues to the present; the An-10/An-12 were used most notably in the Vietnam War, the Soviet\u2013Afghan War and the Chernobyl disaster relief megaoperation.\nIn 1959, the bureau began construction of the separate Flight Testing and Improvement Base in suburban Hostomel (now the Antonov Airport).\nIn 1965, the Antonov An-22 heavy military transport entered serial production to supplement the An-12 in major military and humanitarian airlifts by the Soviet Union. The model became the first Soviet wide-body aircraft, and it remains the world's largest turboprop-powered aircraft. Antonov designed and presented a nuclear-powered version of the An-22. It was never flight tested.\nIn 1966, after the major expansion in the Sviatoshyn neighbourhood of the city, the company was renamed to another disguise name: \"Kiev Mechanical Plant\". Two independent aircraft production and repair facilities, under engineering supervision of the Antonov Bureau, also appeared in Kiev during this period.\nProminence and Antonov's retirement.\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, the company established itself as the Soviet Union's main designer of military transport aircraft with dozens of new modifications in development and production. After Oleg Antonov's death in 1984, the company was officially renamed as the Research and Design Bureau named after O.K. Antonov () while continuing the use of \"Kiev Mechanical Plant\" alias for some purposes.\nLate Soviet-era: superlarge projects and first commercialisation.\nIn the late 1980s, the Antonov Bureau achieved global prominence after the introduction of its extra large aeroplanes. The An-124 \"Ruslan\" (1982) became the Soviet Union's mass-produced strategic airlifter under the leadership of Chief Designer Viktor Tolmachev. The Bureau enlarged the \"Ruslan\" design even more for the Soviet spaceplane programme logistics, creating the An-225 \"Mriya\" in 1985. \"Mriya\" was the world's largest and heaviest aeroplane.\nThe end of the Cold War and perestroika allowed the Antonov company's first step to commercialisation and foreign expansion. In 1989, the Antonov Airlines subsidiary was created for its own aircraft maintenance and cargo projects.\nIndependent Ukraine.\nAntonov Design Bureau remained a state-owned company after Ukraine achieved its independence in 1991 and is since regarded as a strategic national asset.\nSince independence, Antonov has certified and marketed both Soviet-era and newly developed models for sale in new markets outside of the former soviet sphere of influence. New models introduced to serial production and delivered to customers include the Antonov An-140, Antonov An-148 and Antonov An-158 regional airliners.\nAmong several modernisation projects, Antonov received orders for upgrading \"hundreds\" of its An-2 utility planes still in operation in Azerbaijan, Cuba and Russia to the An-2-100 upgrade version.\nIn 2014, following the annexation of the Crimea by Russia, Ukraine cancelled contracts with Russia, leading to a significant income reduction in Ukraine's defense and aviation industries. However Ukraine has been slowly recovering the deficit from breaking ties with Russia by entering new markets such as the Persian Gulf region and expanding its presence in old ones such as India.\nIn July 2018, Antonov was able to secure a deal with Boeing to procure airplane parts which were no longer available due to breakdown of relations with Russia.\nProduction facilities' consolidation.\nDuring the Soviet period, not all Antonov-designed aircraft were manufactured by the company itself. This was a result of Soviet industrial strategy that split military production between different regions of the Soviet Union to minimise potential war loss risks. As a result, Antonov aeroplanes were often assembled by the specialist contract manufacturers.\nIn 2009, the once-independent \"Aviant\" aeroplane-assembling plant in Kyiv became part of Antonov, facilitating a full serial manufacturing cycle of the company. However, the old tradition of co-manufacturing with contractors is continued, both with Soviet-time partners and with new licensees like Iran's Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company.\nIn 2014, Antonov produced and delivered only two An-158 airplanes. This trend continued into 2015, producing one An-148 and one An-158. Since 2016, no aircraft have been produced or delivered to clients.\nIn June 2016, Ukraine's major state-owned arms manufacturer Ukroboronprom announced the creation of the Ukrainian Aircraft Corporation within its structure, thereby combining all aircraft manufacturing enterprises, including the assets of Antonov into a single cluster, according to Ukroboronprom's press service.\nOn 19 July 2017, the Ukrainian government approved the liquidation of Antonov's assets. The State Concern \"Antonov\" (a business group, created in 2005 from the merger of several legally independent companies into a single economic entity under unified management) will be liquidated as a residual corporate entity. Antonov State Company, Kharkiv State Aviation Manufacturing Enterprise and Plant No.410 of Civil Aviation were transferred under the management of another state-owned concern Ukroboronprom in 2015. Antonov State Company continues to function as an enterprise.\nOn 31 March 2017, the first prototype of a new multifunctional cargo plane An-132 \u2013 a demonstration plane An-132D \u2013 took to the air from the runway of Sviatoshyn airfield. The An-132 development program had been implemented in the framework of a contract with a customer from Saudi Arabia.\nOn 24 February 2022, at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in Ukraine, the first attacks were launched at Kyiv-Antonov-2 airfield, the site of Antonov's test flights and home base of the planes of \"Antonov Airlines\". The \u0410n-225 \"Mriya\", An-26, An-74 and administrative premises were destroyed. Other aircraft \u2013 \u0410n-12, \u0410n-22, \u0410n-28, \u0410n-132D and \u0410n-124-100-150 \u2013 along with hangars and other infrastructure were severely damaged.\nThe Security Service of Ukraine established that the former director general of Antonov Company Serhiy Bychkov had not provided access to the site for the National Guard in January and February 2022 and thus obstructed preparations for defence. The investigators considered that Bychkov's negligence is the direct cause of the loss of \"Mriya\", because the plane could have been sent to Germany long before February 24. In March 2023, Serhiy Bychkov was arrested, in April he faced formal suspicion in connection with the loss of An-225 \"Mriya\" and damages to Antonov amounting to \u20b48.4\u00a0million.\nAn An-124 that had been undergoing modernization at Hostomel Airport during the initial Russian invasion was flown out in July 2025.\nProducts and activities.\nFields of commercial activity of Antonov ASTC include:\nAircraft.\nAntonov's primary activity has generally been in developing large military transport aircraft, including the world's largest airplanes, chiefly for the Russian Federation and its predecessor nations.\nAdditionally, Antonov has produced airliners. It has also produced numerous variants of both transports and airliners, for operations ranging from air freight hauling to military reconnaissance, command and control operations.\nIt has also developed various general aviation light aircraft, having originated as a producer of gliders.\nTransports, airliners and derivatives.\nAntonov's aeroplanes (design office prefix \"An\") range from the rugged An-2 biplane through the An-28 reconnaissance aircraft to the massive An-124 Ruslan and An-225 Mriya strategic airlifters (the latter being the world's heaviest aircraft and was the only one in service).\nThe An-24, An-26, An-30 and An-32 family of twin turboprop, high-winged, passenger-cargo-troop transport aircraft are important for domestic/short-haul air services particularly in parts of the world once led by communist governments. The An-72/An-74 series of small jetliners is slowly replacing that fleet, and a larger An-70 freighter is under certification.\nThe Antonov An-148 is a new regional airliner of twin-turbofan configuration. Over 150 aircraft have been ordered since 2007. A stretched version is in development, the An-158 (from 60\u201370 to 90\u2013100 passengers).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its head office was at Warwick House in the Farnborough Aerospace Centre in Farnborough, Hampshire. It purchased Marconi Electronic Systems, the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the General Electric Company, in 1999 to form BAE Systems.\nHistory.\nFormation and privatisation.\nThe company has its origins in the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, which called for the nationalisation and merger of the British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker Siddeley Aviation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish Aviation. On 29 April 1977, the new entity was formed in the United Kingdom as a statutory corporation.\nUnder the provisions of the British Aerospace Act 1980 (c. 26), on 1 January the statutory corporation was transferred to a limited company, which then re-registered as a public limited company (plc), under the name \"British Aerospace Public Limited Company\", on 2 January 1981. BAe was privatised in two main phases, the first in February 1981, involving 51.6% shares of the company, during which the public sale was 3.5 times subscribed and at the end of the first day's trading, share prices were 14% above the original offer price. The second phase occurred in May 1985, in which 48.4% shares were sold; this sale was 5.4 times subscribed and the first day closing price was 11% above the initial offer price. The British Government maintained a \u00a31 golden share, which allowed it to veto foreign control of the board or company.\nProgrammes.\nBritish Aerospace inherited a number of live development programmes from its predecessors. Scottish Aviation was working on a project for a 19-seat turboprop airliner, an upgraded version of the Handley Page Jetstream. BAe placed the Jetstream 31 into production after the first flight of the prototype in March 1980. At the same time, production of Hawker Siddeley's HS 125 business jet, Harrier VTOL jet fighter and HS 748 turboprop airliner continued under BAe, as did that of the Trident jet airliner for a short time. Similarly, low-rate production of the BAC One-Eleven jet airliner, the Strikemaster two-seat military jet trainer/attack aircraft, and the iconic Concorde supersonic airliner also continued. \nOn 29 July 1976, less than a year prior to BAe's formation, the contract for production of the first batch of the Panavia Tornado, an advanced nuclear-capable fighter bomber, was signed. It was developed and produced via a multinational company, Panavia Aircraft GmbH, of which BAe was one of several companies to be heavily involved. On 10 July 1979, the maiden flight of a production Tornado occurred. On 5 and 6 June 1979, the first aircraft were delivered to the RAF and German Air Force respectively. On 25 September 1981, the first Italian Tornado was delivered. \nThe Tornado would be produced in large numbers, the 500th aircraft to be completed was delivered to West Germany on 19 December 1987. Production of the Tornado ended in 1998, the final batch being delivered to the Royal Saudi Air Force, that had ordered a total of 96 IDS Tornados. Aviation author Jon Lake noted that \"The Trinational Panavia Consortium produced just short of 1,000 Tornados, making it one of the most successful postwar bomber programs\".\nIn 1978, BAe relaunched the BAe 146, a short-haul regional airliner that had been previously worked on by Hawker Siddeley. The company marketed it as a quiet and economic turbofan-powered compact airliner that could replace the previous generation of turboprop-powered feeder aircraft. In 1982, the first completed aircraft made its first flight. Upon its launch into service the following year, it was hailed as being \"the world's quietest jetliner\". In 1993, an upgraded model of the BAe 146, referred to as the \"Avro RJ\" series, superseded the original; changes included the replacement of the original Lycoming ALF 502 turbofan engines by higher-thrust LF 507 turbofan engines, which were housed in redesigned nacelles. The Avro RJ series also featured a modernised cockpit with EFIS replacing the analogue ADI, HSI, and engine instrumentation. Production of the Avro RJ ended with the final four aircraft being delivered in late 2003; a total of 173 Avro RJ aircraft was delivered between 1993 and 2003.\nBAe developed several advanced models of the Harrier family. In 1978, the Royal Navy received the first BAe Sea Harrier of an initial order for 24. The Sea Harrier was declared operational three years later, being initially embarked on both the first \"Invincible\" class aircraft carrier HMS \"Invincible\", and the older HMS \"Hermes\". Following their decisive role in the 1982 Falklands War, several of the lessons learnt from the conflict shaped a new upgrade programme for the fleet authorised in 1984, resulting in the \"Sea Harrier FRS.2\" (later known as \"FA2\"). The first flight of the prototype took place in September 1988 and a contract was signed for 29 upgraded aircraft in December of that year. The Sea Harrier FA2 was fitted with the Blue Vixen radar, which was described as one of the most advanced pulse doppler radar systems in the world.\nIn August 1981, BAe and the American aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II. Under this agreement, BAe was effectively a subcontractor rather than a full partner, receiving 40 per cent of the airframe's work-share in terms of man-hours. Production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. The variant procured for the RAF, which was known as the BAe Harrier II, featured many differences, including avionics fit, armaments and equipment; the wing of the GR5 featured a stainless steel leading edge, giving it different flex characteristics from the AV-8B. In December 1989, the first RAF squadron to be equipped with the Harrier II was declared operational.\nIn 1979, BAe officially joined the multinational aircraft manufacturer Airbus and acquired a 20% share in the venture, the move effectively reversed a decision made ten years prior in which the UK government had withdrawn its support for the Airbus consortium. Airbus' first aircraft, the A300, had been received with little initial demand, but orders for the airliner had picked up in the late 1970s. By 1979, the consortium had 256 orders for A300, and Airbus had launched its second airliner, the A310, less than 12 months prior to BAe formally joining the consortium. As time went on, it was becoming clear that Airbus was no longer a temporary collaboration to produce a single design as per its original mission statement; it had become a long-term brand for the development of further aircraft. By the late 1980s, work had begun on a pair of new wide-body airliners, the biggest to be produced at this point under the Airbus name; these would be launched in the 1990s as the Airbus A330 and the Airbus A340.\nDuring the 1983 Paris Air Show, the launch of the \"Experimental Aircraft Programme\" (EAP) to develop and fly an advanced fighter technology demonstrator was announced; at this point, the effort was intended to be a partnership between Britain and several of its European neighbours, including West Germany and Italy. The resulting aircraft, the British Aerospace EAP, ended up being primarily developed by BAe as a private venture; it formed the basis for the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon. In 1986, in conjunction Alenia Aeronautica, CASA and DASA, BAe formed Eurofighter GmbH for the development and production of the Eurofighter. The multinational organisation's head office was established in Hallbergmoos, Bavaria, Germany. The maiden flight of the Eurofighter prototype took place in Bavaria on 27 March 1994, flown by DASA chief test pilot Peter Weger. On 30 January 1998, the first production contract for the Eurofighter was signed between Eurofighter GmbH, engine manufacturer Eurojet and the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency, the organisation set up to manage the procurement of the aircraft.\nOn 26 September 1985, the UK and Saudi Arabian governments signed the Al-Yamamah arms deal with BAe as prime contractor. The contracts, extended in the 1990s and never fully detailed, involved the supply of Panavia Tornado strike and air defence aircraft, BAe Hawk trainer jets, Rapier missile systems, infrastructure works and naval vessels. The Al Yamamah deals are valued at anything up to \u00a320 billion and still continue to provide a large percentage of BAE Systems' profits.\nAcquisitions and restructuring.\nBAe acquired Royal Ordnance, the British armaments manufacturer, for \u00a3190\u00a0million on 22 April 1987. The German armaments specialist Heckler &amp; Koch was folded into this division after BAe acquired it four years later.\nIn 1988, BAe purchased the Rover Group from the British government of Margaret Thatcher for \u00a3150 million. The sale was controversial due to opaque financial arrangements between the government and BAe; however the House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee was said to believe that \"in spite of a catalogue of complaints, the committee concludes that the sale to BAe may well have been the best solution for the government.\"\nIn 1991, BAe acquired a 30% interest in Hutchison Telecommunications through a stock swap deal, where Hutchison was given a controlling stake of 65% in BAe's wholly owned subsidiary Microtel Communications Ltd. In August 1991, BAe formed a naval systems joint venture, BAeSEMA, with the Sema Group. BAe acquired Sema's 50% share in 1998. That year also saw BAe begin to experience major difficulties. BAe saw its share price fall below 100p for the first time. On 9 September 1991, the company issued a profits warning and later that week \"bungled\" the launch of a \u00a3432 million rights issue. On 25 September 1991 BAe directors led by CEO Richard Evans ousted the Chairman Professor Sir Roland Smith in a move described by \"The Independent\" as \"one of the most spectacular and brutal boardroom coups witnessed in many years.\" Evans described the troubles as a confluence of events:\n \"our property company [Arlington Securities] was hit with a lousy market. Sales of the Rover Group sank by about a fifth and losses mounted. The government's defence spending volumes underwent a major review. Losses in our commercial aerospace division increased dramatically with the recession in the airline industry.\"\nIn mid-1992, BAe wrote off \u00a31 billion of assets, largely as part of redundancies and restructuring of its regional aircraft division. This was the largest asset write-off in UK corporate history. General Electric Company (GEC), later to sell its defence interests to BAe, came close to acquiring BAe at this time. BAe cut 47% of its workforce (60,000 out of 127,000), 40,000 of which were from the regional aircraft division.\nEvans decided to sell non-core business activities, which included the Rover Group, Arlington Securities, BAe Corporate Jets, BAe Communications and Ballast Nedam. Although the rationale of diversification was sound (to shield the company from cyclical aerospace and defence markets) the struggling company could not afford to continue the position: \"We simply could not afford to carry two core businesses, cars and aerospace. At one point Rover was eating up about \u00a32 billion of our banking capacity.\" BAe Corporate Jets and Arkansas Aerospace were sold to Raytheon in 1993. In 1994, the Rover Group was sold to BMW and British Aerospace Space Systems was sold to Matra Marconi Space. In 1998, BAe's shareholding of Orange was reduced to 5%. The Orange shareholding was a legacy of the 30% stake in Hutchison Telecommunications (UK) Ltd.\nIn 1994, BAeSEMA, Siemens Plessey and GEC-Marconi formed UKAMS Limited as part of the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) consortium. UKAMS would become a wholly owned subsidiary of BAe Dynamics in 1998. In 1995, Saab Military Aircraft and BAe signed an agreement for the joint development and marketing of the export version of the JAS 39 Gripen. In 1996, BAe and Matra Defense agreed to merge their missile businesses into a joint venture called Matra BAe Dynamics. In 1997, BAe joined the Lockheed Martin X-35 Joint Strike Fighter team. The following year, BAe acquired the UK operations of Siemens Plessey Systems (SPS) from Siemens, while DASA purchased SPS' German assets.\nIn the 1990s, BAe was the largest exporter based in the United Kingdom; a Competition Commission report released in 2005 calculated a ten-year aggregate figure of \u00a345 billion, with defence sales accounting for approximately 80%.\nTransition to BAE Systems.\nIn the late 1990s, European defence consolidation became a prevailing practice; European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company. This ambition led to numerous reports linking various European defence groups \u2013 mainly with each other but also with American defence contractors. In July 1998, merger discussions began between BAe and DASA. Terms for such a merger had been reportedly agreed between British Aerospace Chairman Richard Evans and DASA CEO J\u00fcrgen Schrempp in December 1998. However, when the British General Electric Company (GEC) put its defence electronics business Marconi Electronic Systems (MES) up for sale on 22 December 1998, BAe's management opted to abandon the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. During 2004, Evans stated that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA.\nSchrempp was angered by BAe's reversal, and opted to pursue other partner companies for DASA to merge with. On 11 June 1999, the Spanish aircraft company CASA signed a memorandum of understanding for such a merger. On 14 October 1999, DASA agreed to merge with A\u00e9rospatiale-Matra to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS). 10 July 2000 was \"day one\" for the new company, which became the world's second-largest aerospace company after Boeing and the second-largest European arms manufacturer after BAE Systems.\nThe GEC merger to create a solely British company, compared to the prospective Anglo-German company that would have resulted from merging with DASA, was promoted as having superior prospects for further penetration of the lucrative defence market of the United States. The newly combined company, which was initially referred to as \"New British Aerospace\", was officially formed on 30 November 1999; it is named BAE Systems.\nCorruption investigation and criticisms.\nThere have been allegations that the Al Yamamah contracts were a result of bribes (\"douceurs\") to members of the Saudi royal family and government officials. Some allegations suggested that the former Prime Minister's son Mark Thatcher may have been involved; he has strongly denied receiving payments or exploiting his mother's connections in his business dealings. The National Audit Office investigated the contracts and has so far never released its conclusions \u2013 the only NAO report ever to be withheld. The BBC's \"Newsnight\" observed that it is ironic that the once classified report analysing the construction of MI5's Thames House and MI6's Vauxhall Cross headquarters has been released, but the Al Yamamah report is still deemed too sensitive.\nThe 2007 documentary film \"Welcome Aboard Toxic Airlines\" contained evidence that vital data was withheld from a 1999\u20132000 Australian Senate Inquiry into the health and flight safety issues relating to oil fumes on the British Aerospace 146. The film also contains an Australian Senator's speech about money being paid by BAe for silence on the fumes issue.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was split off from GEC and bought by British Aerospace (BAe) on 30 November 1999 to form BAE Systems. GEC then renamed itself Marconi plc.\nMES exists today as BAE Systems Electronics Limited, a subsidiary of BAE Systems, but the assets were rearranged elsewhere within that company. MES-related businesses include BAE Systems Submarine Solutions, BAE Systems Surface Ships, BAE Systems Insyte and Selex ES (now a part of Leonardo).\nHistory.\nThe Marconi Company had been formed by Guglielmo Marconi in 1897 in Britain, originally under the name of The Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company. Following GEC's acquisition of Marconi as part of English Electric in 1968, the Marconi brand was used for its defence businesses, e.g. Marconi Space &amp; Defence Systems (MSDS), Marconi Underwater Systems Ltd (MUSL). \nWhen it was acquired by GEC, MES represented the pinnacle of the company's defence businesses, which had a heritage of almost 100 years. GEC's history of military products dates back to World War I with its contribution to the war effort then including radios and bulbs. World War II consolidated this position with the company involved in many important technological advances, most notably radar.\nBetween 1945 and GEC's demerger of its defence business in 1999, the company became a major defence contractor. GEC's major defence related acquisitions included Associated Electrical Industries in 1967, English Electric Company (including Marconi as a subsidiary) in 1968, Yarrow Shipbuilders in 1985, parts of Ferranti's defence business in 1990, Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering in 1995 and Kvaerner Govan in 1999. In June 1998, MES acquired Tracor, a major American defence contractor, for US$1.4 billion.\nDemerger.\nThe 1997 merger of American corporations Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which followed the forming of Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defence contractor in 1995, increased the pressure on European defence companies to consolidate. In June 1997, British Aerospace Defence managing director John Weston commented \"Europe... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S.\". European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company.\nAs early as 1995, British Aerospace and the German aerospace and defence company DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company. Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998. A merger was agreed between British Aerospace chairman Richard Evans and DASA CEO J\u00fcrgen Schrempp in December 1998.\nGEC was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation. Reporting the appointment of George Simpson as GEC managing director in 1996, \"The Independent\" had said \"some analysts believe that Mr Simpson's inside knowledge of BAe, a long-rumoured GEC bid target, was a key to his appointment. GEC favours forging a national \"champion\" defence group with BAe to compete with the giant US organisations\". When GEC put MES up for sale on 22 December 1998, BAE abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. The merger of British Aerospace and MES was announced on 19 January 1999. Evans stated that in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA. The merger created a vertically integrated company which \"The Scotsman\" described as \"[a combination of British Aerospace's] contracting and platform-building skills with Marconi's coveted electronics systems capability\". for example combining the manufacturer of the Eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircraft's electronic systems; British Aerospace was MES' largest customer. In contrast, DASA's response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with A\u00e9rospatiale to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), a horizontal integration. EADS has since considered a merger with Thales to create a \"fully rounded\" company.\nWhile MES was responsible for the majority of GEC's defence sales other GEC companies achieved defence related sales, principally GEC Alsthom, GEC-Plessey Telecommunications (GPT) and GEC Plessey Semiconductors.\nMajor projects.\n\"This is a partial list:\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Prior to 1983, it was known as the Bellanca Aircraft Company. The company was founded in 1927 by Giuseppe Mario Bellanca, although it was preceded by previous businesses and partnerships in which aircraft with the Bellanca name were produced, including Wright-Bellanca, in which he was in partnership with Wright Aeronautical.\nIn 2021 the company was reformed as Bellanca Aircraft, Inc and located in San Luis Obispo, CA with a satellite maintenance facility in Oklahoma. The new company supplies maintenance and aircraft parts, for the legacy Cruisemaster and Viking aircraft.\nHistory.\nAfter Giuseppe Mario Bellanca, the designer and builder of Italy's first aircraft, moved to the United States in 1911, he began to design aircraft for a number of firms, including the Maryland Pressed Steel Company, Wright Aeronautical Corporation and the Columbia Aircraft Corporation. Bellanca founded his own company, Bellanca Aircraft Corporation of America, in 1927, sited first in Richmond Hill, New York and moving in 1928 to New Castle (Wilmington), Delaware. In the 1920s and 1930s, Bellanca's aircraft of his own design were known for their efficiency and low operating cost, gaining fame for world record endurance and distance flights. Lindbergh's first choice for his New York to Paris flight was a Bellanca WB-2. The company's insistence on selecting the crew drove Lindbergh to Ryan.\nBellanca remained president and chairman of the board from the corporation's inception on the last day of 1927 until he sold the company to L. Albert and Sons in 1954. From that time on, the Bellanca line was part of a succession of companies that maintained the lineage of the original aircraft produced by Bellanca.\nIn 2022, the company moved from Alexandria, Minnesota to Sulphur, Oklahoma. While as of 2024 the company website states \"Bellanca recently opened a new aircraft factory and maintenance facility in Sulphur, Oklahoma,\" no new aircraft have been recently produced.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located about some 800\u00a0m from Porta San Sebastiano, where the Via Ardeatina branches off the Appian Way, on the site where, according to the apocryphal \"Acts of Peter\", Saint Peter met the risen Christ while Peter was fleeing persecution in Rome. According to the tradition, Peter asked him, \"Lord, where are you going?\" (). Christ answered, \"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\" ().\nHistory.\nThere has been a sanctuary on the spot since the ninth century, but the current church is from 1637. The current fa\u00e7ade was added in the 17th century.\nIt has been supposed that the sanctuary might have been even more ancient, perhaps a Christian adaptation of an already existing temple: the church is in fact located in front of the sacred \"campus\" dedicated to Rediculus, the Roman \"God of the Return\". This \"campus\" hosted a sanctuary for the cult of the deity that received devotion by travellers before their departure, especially those going to face long and dangerous journeys to far-off places like Egypt, Greece or the East. Those travellers upon their safe return also stopped to thank the god for the happy outcome of their journey.\nThe presence of the Apostle Peter in this area, where he is supposed to have lived, appears to be confirmed in an epigraph in the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian that reads \"Domus Petri\" (). An epigram by Pope Damasus I (366\u2013384) in honor of Peter and Paul reads: \"You that are looking for the names of Peter and Paul, you must know that the saints have lived here.\"\nThe two footprints on a marble slab at the center of the church \u2014 nowadays a copy of the original, which is kept in the nearby Basilica of San Sebastiano fuori le mura \u2014 are popularly believed to be a miraculous sign left by Jesus. The official name of the church alludes to these footprints: \"palmis\" refers to the soles of Jesus' feet. \nAn inscription above the front door on the church's fa\u00e7ade formerly read \"Stop your walking, traveller, and enter this sacred temple in which you will find the footprint of our Lord Jesus Christ when He met with St. Peter who escaped from the prison. An alms for the wax and the oil is recommended in order to free some spirits from Purgatory.\" Pope Gregory XVI found the advertising tone of this inscription so inappropriate that he ordered its removal in 1845.\nThere is also a modern column with a bust of Henryk Sienkiewicz, the Polish author of the famous historical fiction novel \"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero\" (1896). It is said that Sienkiewicz was inspired to write his novel while sitting in this church.\nThe church is currently administered by priests of the Congregation of Saint Michael the Archangel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "47671", "revid": "39076087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47671", "title": "Toxic heavy metal", "text": "Category of substances\nA toxic heavy metal is a common but misleading term for a metal-like element noted for its potential toxicity. Not all heavy metals are toxic and some toxic metals are not heavy. Elements often discussed as toxic include cadmium, lead, and mercury all of which appear in the World Health Organization's list of 10 chemicals of major public concern. Other examples include chromium, nickel, antimony, arsenic, bismuth, thallium, and tin.\nThese toxic elements are found naturally in the earth. They become concentrated as a result of human caused activities and can enter plant and animal (including human) tissues via inhalation, diet, and manual handling. Then, they can bind to and interfere with the functioning of vital cellular components. The toxic effects of arsenic, mercury, and lead were known to the ancients, but methodical studies of the toxicity of some heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In humans, heavy metal poisoning is generally treated by the administration of chelating agents. Some elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are essential, in small quantities, for human health.\nControversial terminology.\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), which standardizes nomenclature, says the term \"'heavy metals' is both meaningless and misleading\". The IUPAC report focuses on the legal and toxicological implications of describing \"heavy metals\" as toxins when there is no scientific evidence to support a connection. The density implied by the adjective \"heavy\" has almost no biological consequences and pure metals are rarely the biologically active substance.\nThis characterization has been echoed by numerous reviews. The most widely used toxicology textbook, \"Casarett and Doull's Toxicology\", uses \"toxic metal\" not \"heavy metals\". Nevertheless many scientific and science related articles continue to use \"heavy metal\" as a term for toxic substances.\nMajor and minor metal toxins.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Periodic table (32 columns, micro)/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMajor toxic metals\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Periodic table (32 columns, micro)/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEssential but potentially toxic elements\nMetals with multiple toxic effects include arsenic (As), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and nickel (Ni). \nElements that are nutritionally essential for animal or plant life but which are considered toxic metals in high doses or other forms include cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn).\nContamination sources.\nToxic metals are found naturally in the earth, and become concentrated as a result of human activities, or, in some cases geochemical processes, such as accumulation in peat soils that are then released when drained for agriculture. Common sources include fertilisers; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. Arsenic is thought to be used in connection with coloring dyes. Rat poison used in grain and mash stores may be another source of the arsenic.\nThe geographical extent of sources may be very large. For example, up to one-sixth of China's arable land might be affected by heavy metal contamination. \nLead is the most prevalent heavy metal contaminant. As a component of tetraethyl lead, (CH3CH2)4Pb, it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s\u20131970s. Lead levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be two to three times those of pre-industrial levels. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Lead (from lead(II) azide or lead styphnate used in firearms) gradually accumulates at firearms training grounds, contaminating the local environment and exposing range employees to a risk of lead poisoning.\nEntry routes.\nToxic metals enter plant, animal and human tissues via air inhalation, diet, and manual handling. Welding, galvanizing, brazing, and soldering exposes workers to fumes that may be inhaled and result in metal fume fever. Motor vehicle emissions are a major source of airborne contaminants including arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, nickel, lead, antimony, vanadium, zinc, platinum, palladium and rhodium. Water sources (groundwater, lakes, streams and rivers) can be polluted by toxic metals leaching from industrial and consumer waste; acid rain can exacerbate this process by releasing toxic metals trapped in soils. Transport through soil can be facilitated by the presence of preferential flow paths (macropores) and dissolved organic compounds. Plants are exposed to toxic metals through the uptake of water; animals eat these plants; ingestion of plant- and animal-based foods are the largest sources of toxic metals in humans. Absorption through skin contact, for example from contact with soil, or metal containing toys and jewelry, is another potential source of toxic metal contamination. Toxic metals can bioaccumulate in organisms as they are hard to metabolize.\nDetrimental effects.\nToxic metals \"can bind to vital cellular components, such as structural proteins, enzymes, and nucleic acids, and interfere with their functioning\". Symptoms and effects can vary according to the metal or metal compound, and the dose involved. Broadly, long-term exposure to toxic heavy metals can have carcinogenic, central and peripheral nervous system, and circulatory effects. For humans, typical presentations associated with exposure to any of the \"classical\" toxic heavy metals, or chromium (another toxic heavy metal) or arsenic (a metalloid), are shown in the table.\nHistory.\nThe toxic effects of arsenic, mercury and lead were known to the ancients but methodical studies of the overall toxicity of heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In that year, Wanklyn and Chapman speculated on the adverse effects of the heavy metals \"arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, iron and manganese\" in drinking water. They noted an \"absence of investigation\" and were reduced to \"the necessity of pleading for the collection of data\". In 1884, Blake described an apparent connection between toxicity and the atomic weight of an element. The following sections provide historical thumbnails for the \"classical\" toxic heavy metals (arsenic, mercury and lead) and some more recent examples (chromium and cadmium).\nArsenic.\nArsenic, as realgar (As4S4) and orpiment (As2S3), was known in ancient times. Strabo (64\u201350 BCE \u2013 c. AD 24?), a Greek geographer and historian, wrote that only slaves were employed in realgar and orpiment mines since they would inevitably die from the toxic effects of the fumes given off from the ores. Arsenic-contaminated beer poisoned over 6,000 people in the Manchester area of England in 1900, and is thought to have killed at least 70 victims. Clare Luce, American ambassador to Italy from 1953 to 1956, suffered from arsenic poisoning. Its source was traced to flaking arsenic-laden paint on the ceiling of her bedroom. She may also have eaten food contaminated by arsenic in flaking ceiling paint in the embassy dining room. Ground water contaminated by arsenic, as of 2014, \"is still poisoning millions of people in Asia\".\nMercury.\nThe first emperor of unified China, Qin Shi Huang, it is reported, died of ingesting mercury pills that were intended to give him eternal life. The phrase \"mad as a hatter\" is likely a reference to mercury poisoning among milliners (so-called \"mad hatter disease\"), as mercury-based compounds were once used in the manufacture of felt hats in the 18th and 19th century. Historically, gold amalgam (an alloy with mercury) was widely used in gilding, leading to numerous casualties among the workers. It is estimated that during the construction of Saint Isaac's Cathedral alone, 60 workers died from the gilding of the main dome. Outbreaks of methylmercury poisoning occurred in several places in Japan during the 1950s due to industrial discharges of mercury into rivers and coastal waters. The best-known instances were in Minamata and Niigata. In Minamata alone, more than 600 people died due to what became known as Minamata disease. More than 21,000 people filed claims with the Japanese government, of which almost 3000 became certified as having the disease. In 22 documented cases, pregnant women who consumed contaminated fish showed mild or no symptoms but gave birth to infants with severe developmental disabilities. Since the Industrial Revolution, mercury levels have tripled in many near-surface seawaters, especially around Iceland and Antarctica.\nLead.\nThe adverse effects of lead were known to the ancients. In the 2nd century BC the Greek botanist Nicander described the colic and paralysis seen in lead-poisoned people. Dioscorides, a Greek physician who is thought to have lived in the 1st century CE, wrote that lead \"makes the mind give way\". Lead was used extensively in Roman aqueducts from about 500 BC to 300 AD. Julius Caesar's engineer, Vitruvius, reported, \"water is much more wholesome from earthenware pipes than from lead pipes. For it seems to be made injurious by lead, because white lead is produced by it, and this is said to be harmful to the human body.\" During the Mongol period in China (1271\u22121368 AD), lead pollution due to silver smelting in the Yunnan region exceeded contamination levels from modern mining activities by nearly four times. In the 17th and 18th centuries, people in Devon were afflicted by a condition referred to as Devon colic; this was discovered to be due to the imbibing of lead-contaminated cider. In 2013, the World Health Organization estimated that lead poisoning resulted in 143,000 deaths, and \"contribute[d] to 600,000 new cases of children with intellectual disabilities\", each year. In the U.S. city of Flint, Michigan, lead contamination in drinking water has been an issue since 2014. The source of the contamination has been attributed to \"corrosion in the lead and iron pipes that distribute water to city residents\". In 2015, the lead concentration of drinking water in north-eastern Tasmania, Australia, reached a level over 50 times the prescribed national drinking water guidelines. The source of the contamination was attributed to \"a combination of dilapidated drinking water infrastructure, including lead jointed pipelines, end-of-life polyvinyl chloride pipes and household plumbing\".\nChromium.\nChromium(III) compounds and chromium metal are not considered a health hazard, while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of chromium(VI) have been known since at least the late 19th century. In 1890, Newman described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company. Chromate-induced dermatitis was reported in aircraft workers during World War II. In 1963, an outbreak of dermatitis, ranging from erythema to exudative eczema, occurred amongst 60 automobile factory workers in England. The workers had been wet-sanding chromate-based primer paint that had been applied to car bodies. In Australia, chromium was released from the Newcastle Orica explosives plant on August 8, 2011. Up to 20 workers at the plant were exposed as were 70 nearby homes in Stockton. The town was only notified three days after the release and the accident sparked a major public controversy, with Orica criticised for playing down the extent and possible risks of the leak, and the state Government attacked for their slow response to the incident.\nCadmium.\nCadmium exposure is a phenomenon of the early 20th century, and onwards. In Japan in 1910, the Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting Company began discharging cadmium into the Jinz\u016b River, as a byproduct of mining operations. Residents in the surrounding area subsequently consumed rice grown in cadmium-contaminated irrigation water. They experienced softening of the bones and kidney failure. The origin of these symptoms was not clear; possibilities raised at the time included \"a regional or bacterial disease or lead poisoning\". In 1955, cadmium was identified as the likely cause and in 1961 the source was directly linked to mining operations in the area. In February 2010, cadmium was found in Walmart exclusive Miley Cyrus jewelry. Wal-Mart continued to sell the jewelry until May, when covert testing organised by Associated Press confirmed the original results. In June 2010 cadmium was detected in the paint used on promotional drinking glasses for the movie \"Shrek Forever After\", sold by McDonald's Restaurants, triggering a recall of 12 million glasses.\nRemediation.\nHuman.\nIn humans, heavy metal poisoning is generally treated by the administration of chelating agents. These are chemical compounds, such as CaNa2EDTA (calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) that convert heavy metals to chemically inert forms that can be excreted without further interaction with the body. Chelates are not without side effects and can also remove beneficial metals from the body. Vitamin and mineral supplements are sometimes co-administered for this reason\nEnvironment.\nSoils contaminated by heavy metals can be remediated by one or more of the following technologies: isolation; immobilization; toxicity reduction; physical separation; or extraction. \"Isolation\" involves the use of caps, membranes or below-ground barriers in an attempt to quarantine the contaminated soil. \"Immobilization\" aims to alter the properties of the soil so as to hinder the mobility of the heavy contaminants. \"Toxicity reduction\" attempts to oxidise or reduce the toxic heavy metal ions, via chemical or biological means into less toxic or mobile forms. \"Physical separation\" involves the removal of the contaminated soil and the separation of the metal contaminants by mechanical means. \"Extraction\" is an on or off-site process that uses chemicals, high-temperature volatization, or electrolysis to extract contaminants from soils. The process or processes used will vary according to contaminant and the characteristics of the site.\nBenefits.\nSome elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are essential, in small quantities, for human health. These elements include vanadium, manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, strontium and molybdenum. A deficiency of these essential metals may increase susceptibility to heavy metal poisoning.\nSelenium is the most toxic of the heavy metals that are essential for mammals. Selenium is normally excreted and only becomes toxic when the intake exceeds the excretory capacity.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Formerly known as Aeronautica Macchi, the company was founded in 1912 by Giulio Macchi at Varese in north-western Lombardy as Nieuport-Macchi, to build Nieuport monoplanes under licence for the Italian military. With a factory located on the shores of Lake Varese, the firm originally manufactured a series of Nieuport designs, as well as seaplanes.\nAfter World War II, the company began producing motorcycles as a way to fill the post-war need for cheap, efficient transportation.\nThe company later specialised in civil and military pilot training aircraft. In July 2003, Aermacchi was integrated into the Finmeccanica Group (now Leonardo) as Alenia Aermacchi, which increased its shareholding to 99%.\nMilitary trainers.\nSince the beginning, the design and production of military trainers have been the core business of Alenia Aermacchi.\nThe products include: \nMilitary collaboration.\nAlenia Aermacchi has cooperated in international military programs:\nAlenia Aermacchi takes part in the AMX program with Alenia Aeronautica and Embraer of Brazil with a total share of 24%. Alenia Aermacchi develops and manufactures the fuselage forward and rear sections and installs some avionic equipment in the aircraft. A Mid-Life Updating program is required by the Italian Air Force to upgrade the aircraft capabilities.\nAlenia Aermacchi designs and produces wing pylons and wing tips, roots, trailing edges and flaps, which represents a 5% share in the overall program.\nAlenia Aermacchi has a share of more than 4% in the Eurofighter program, for the design and development of wing pylons, twin missile and twin store carriers, ECM pods, carbon fiber structures and titanium engine cowlings.\nAfter participating in the G-222 transport aircraft program, the company is involved in the new Military Transport Aircraft C-27J Spartan, for the production of outer wings.\nCivil programs.\nSince the mid-1990s, Alenia Aermacchi has participated in programs for the supply of engine nacelles for civil aircraft. It produces cold parts for engine nacelles: inlets, fan cowls and EBU, the systems-to-engine interface. \nIn 1999, the company established a joint venture (MHD) with Hurel-Dubois (presently Hurel-Hispano, of SNECMA group). It is a French company specializing in the development and manufacture of thrust reversers, to obtain the full responsibility for the development of nacelles installed on maximum 100-seat aircraft.\nMotorcycles.\n1950s.\nAermacchi began producing motorcycles in c. 1951; the first Aermacchi to be marketed to the public was a scooter/motorcycle hybrid called the 'Convertible', with the majority of working parts semi-enclosed, an under-saddle engine and foot boards, a conventional motorcycle fuel tank position and wheels.\nIt was succeeded in 1953 by the 'Zeffiro' which was offered with a 125\u00a0cc or 150\u00a0cc two-stroke engine; these later models had upgraded suspension but remained similar in appearance.\nIn 1955, they produced the 125\u00a0cc Monsone, followed by the 150\u00a0cc Corsaro, both of which had pivoted fork rear suspension and telescopic front forks. They were two-strokes like the early models and ran a 4-speed gearbox.\nIn 1956 they produced their first over head valve four-stroke engine on the Chimera fitted horizontally, a layout which would become a standard for the marque. Similar to their first offering, the Chimera kept many enclosed working parts.\nIn 1957 they released a series of sport models, powered by a single cylinder ohv engine in 175\u00a0cc or 250\u00a0cc displacements. Aermacchi continued with scooter production, but sales were poor and they were unable to compete in the market amongst the well established Vespas and Lambrettas, and concentrated solely on the production of motorcycles.\n1960s and beyond.\nIn 1960, US business motorcycles purchased 50% of Aermacchi's motorcycle division. The Italian branch of the brand was named 'Aermacchi-Harley-Davidson' and the first bike was a variation of the 'Ala Verde' suitably modified for the American market. This was also the year that the Chimera ceased production.\nThe remaining motorcycle holdings were sold in 1974 to AMF-Harley-Davidson, with motorcycles continuing to be made at Varese.\nThe business was sold to Cagiva in 1978.\nRacing History.\nAfter the Harley Davidson investment, Aermacchi branched out into racing with a 250\u00a0cc production-volume Ala d'Oro for road racing competition. Early results varied but over years of bike development the team placed third during the 1966 350\u00a0cc World Championship with racer Renzo Pasolini and third again in 1968 with Kelvin Carruthers. The following year Carruthers competed at the Isle of Man TT.\nA new era began in 1971 with the development of twin-cylinder two-stroke racers of 250cc and 350cc capacity, designed at Aermacchi by their chief engineer, Ing. William Soncini. The first 250cc racer was very fast, with 46\u00a0hp at 11,000rpm, and weighed only 250\u00a0lbs. After Harley-Davidson acquired 100% of Aermacchi in 1972, they funded further racing development at the Aermacchi factory, and the racers were branded with Harley-Davidson on their fuel tanks. These two-stroke twins provided Harley-Davidson with their only Grand Prix wins, and four World Championships: 250cc World Championship in 1974, '75, and '76, and the 350cc World Championship in 1976, all under rider Walter Villa."}

Robert's brother Norman Blackburn later became managing director.\nBlackburn acquired the Cirrus-Hermes Engineering company in 1934, beginning its manufacture of aircraft engines. However an updated range of engines was under development and Blackburn wanted to wait until it was established before giving its name to them, so Cirrus Hermes Engineering was retained as a separate company for the time being.\nThe company's name was changed to Blackburn Aircraft Limited in 1936.\nIn 1937, with the new Cirrus engines now well established, engine manufacturing was brought into the parent company as an operating division, giving rise to the Blackburn Cirrus name.\nBy 1937, pressure to re-arm was growing and the Yorkshire factory was approaching capacity. A fortuitous friendship between Maurice Denny, managing director of William Denny and Brothers, the Dumbarton ship building company, and Robert Blackburn resulted in the building of a new Blackburn factory at Barge Park, Dumbarton where production of the Blackburn Botha commenced in 1939.\nBlackburn amalgamated with General Aircraft Limited in 1949 as Blackburn and General Aircraft Limited, reverting to Blackburn Aircraft Limited by 1958.\nAs part of the rationalisation of British aircraft manufacturers, its aircraft production and engine operations were absorbed into Hawker Siddeley and Bristol Siddeley respectively in 1960/1961. The Blackburn name was dropped completely in 1963.\nAn American company, Blackburn Aircraft Corp., was incorporated in Detroit on 20 May 1929 to acquire design and patent rights of the aircraft of Blackburn Airplane &amp; Motor Co., Ltd. in the USA. It was owned 90% by Detroit Aircraft Corp. and 10% by Blackburn Airplane &amp; Motor Co., Ltd. Agreements covered such rights in North and South America, excepting Brazil and certain rights in Canada and provided that all special tools and patterns were to be supplied by the UK company at cost.\nLocations.\nThe company had factories at Olympia in Leeds, Sherburn-in-Elmet, Brough (East Yorkshire) and Dumbarton. In the early days, Blackburn himself flew aircraft on the beaches at Marske and Filey, with the company also using the former RAF Holme-on-Spalding Moor. Before production shifted to Sherburn-in-Elmet and Brough from the Leeds site, aircraft were flown in and out of Olympia works by an adjacent airstrip in Roundhay Park.\nAircraft.\nThe company also produced aircraft from other aircraft companies' specifications, such as the Sopwith Cuckoo (1918) and the Fairey Swordfish (1942), both of which were built at Blackburn's Sherburn-in-Elmet factory.\nSee also.\nRelated lists"}

He appears in the television series ' (\"TNG\"), the and of ', and the of '; and the feature films \"Star Trek Generations\" (1994), ' (1996), ' (1998), and ' (2002). Data is portrayed by actor Brent Spiner.\nData is a self-aware, sapient, sentient and anatomically fully functional male android who serves as the second officer and chief operations officer aboard the Federation starship USS \"Enterprise\"-D and later the USS \"Enterprise\"-E.\nData is in many ways a successor to the original \"\"'s Spock, in that the character has superior mental skills and offers an \"outsider's\" perspective on humanity.\nDevelopment.\nGene Roddenberry told Brent Spiner that over the course of the series, Data was to become \"more and more like a human until the end of the show, when he would be very close, but still not quite there. That was the idea and that's the way that the writers took it.\" Spiner felt that Data exhibited the Chaplinesque characteristics of a sad, tragic clown. To get into his role as Data, Spiner used the character of Robby the Robot from the film \"Forbidden Planet\" as a role model. Before Spiner was cast, Eric Menyuk, Mark Lindsay Chapman, Kevin Peter Hall, and Kelvin Han Yee were considered for the role.\nCommenting on Data's perpetual albino-like appearance, he said: \"I spent more hours of the day in make-up than out of make-up\", so much so that he even called it a way of method acting. Spiner also portrayed Data's manipulative and malevolent brother Lore (a role he found much easier to play, because the character was \"more like me\"), and Data's creator, Dr. Noonien Soong. Additionally, he portrayed another Soong-type android, B-4, in the film ', and also Arik Soong, one of Soong's ancestors in three episodes of '. Spiner said his favorite Data scene takes place in \"\", when Data plays poker on the holodeck with a re-creation of the famous physicist Stephen Hawking, played by Hawking himself.\nSpiner reprised his role of Data in the ' series finale \"These Are the Voyages...\" in an off-screen speaking part. Spiner felt that he had visibly aged out of the role and that Data was best presented as a youthful figure. Spiner returned to the role for 2020 ', having been convinced by the advent of digital de-aging tools. He also accepted because the negative fan reaction to the death of Data in \"Nemesis\" took him by surprise, and the scene in \"Picard\" gave a new opportunity for a proper sendoff to the character. Initially stating that the 2020 of \"Picard\" would be his final time playing Data, Spiner returned to the role for the series' 2023 , portraying an aged Data, Lore, and B-4.\nDepiction.\nBiography.\nData was found by Starfleet in 2338. He was the sole survivor on Omicron Theta in the rubble of a colony left after an attack from the Crystalline Entity. He is a synthetic lifeform with artificial intelligence, designed and built by Doctor Noonien Soong in his own likeness (likewise portrayed by Spiner). \nHis positronic brain allows him impressive computational capabilities. He experienced ongoing difficulties during the early years of his life with understanding various aspects of human behavior and was unable to feel emotion or understand certain human idiosyncrasies, inspiring him to strive for his own humanity. This goal eventually led to the addition of an \"emotion chip\", created by Soong, to Data's positronic net. Although Data's endeavor to increase his humanity and desire for human emotional experience is a significant plot point (and source of humor) throughout the series, he consistently shows a nuanced sense of wisdom, sensitivity and curiosity, garnering respect from his peers and colleagues.\nDialog in \"Datalore\" establishes some of Data's backstory. It is stated that he was deactivated in 2336 on Omicron Theta before an attack by the Crystalline Entity, a spaceborne creature which converts life forms to energy for sustenance. He was found and reactivated by Starfleet personnel two years later. Data went to Starfleet Academy from 2341 to 2345 (he describes himself as \"Class of '78\" to Commander William Riker in the series premiere \"Encounter at Farpoint\"\u2014with \"honors in probability mechanics and exobiology\", although canonically may only refer to the stardate) and then served in Starfleet aboard the USS \"Trieste\". He was assigned to the \"Enterprise\" under Captain Jean-Luc Picard in 2364. In \"Datalore\", Data discovers his amoral brother, Lore, and learns that Dr. Noonien Soong created Data after Lore. Lore fails in an attempt to betray the \"Enterprise\" to the Crystalline Entity, and Wesley Crusher beams Data's brother into space at the episode's conclusion. Lore claimed that Data was \"less-perfect\", which was a lie, as Soong later confirmed to Data in \"Brothers\"; the only real difference between the two of them \"was some programming\" (Lore's positronic net differed from Data's: it had a Type-\"L\" phase discriminator compared to Data's Type-\"R\"; see episode \").\nTelevision series and films.\nIt was in the Star Trek prequel \" episode \"\" that the origin of Data can be traced back to a scientific theory created by genetic engineer Arik Soong, ancestor to Data's \"father/creator\" Noonien Soong, who noted that his theory would take generations beyond his lifetime to develop into a practical working model. Arik Soong created the theory while serving life imprisonment for recreating the discontinued \"Augments\" program which originally started the Eugenics War of the late 20th century. This links the Data storyline to that of Khan Noonien Singh from the .\nIn \"\", a Starfleet judge rules that Data is not Starfleet property.\nData's family is expanded in \", which introduces Lal, a gynoid based on Data's neural interface and whom Data refers to as his daughter. Lal \"dies\" shortly after activation. In \", Data reunites with Dr. Soong. There he meets again with Lore, who steals the emotion chip Soong meant for Data to receive. Lore then fatally wounds Soong. In \", Lore returns, using the emotion chip to control Data and make him help with Lore's attempt to make the Borg entirely artificial lifeforms. Data eventually deactivates Lore, and recovers, but does not install the damaged emotion chip. In \", Soong's former wife Juliana reunites with Data, though the crew discovers she was a gynoid duplicate built by Soong after the real Julianna's death, programmed to die after a long life, and to believe she is the true Julianna unaware of the fact she is an android. Faced with the decision, Data chooses not to disclose this to her and allows her to continue her normal life.\nIn \", the two-hour series finale of \"The Next Generation\", Captain Picard travels among three different time periods. The Picard of 25 years into the future goes with Geordi La Forge to seek advice from now Professor Data, a luminary physicist who holds the Lucasian Chair at Cambridge University.\nIn the film \"Star Trek Generations\", Data finally installs the emotion chip he retrieved from Lore, and experiences the full scope of emotions. However, those emotions proved difficult to control and Data struggled to master them. In ', Data has managed to gain complete control of the chip, which includes deactivating it to maintain his performance efficiency. In the film ', Data beams Picard off an enemy ship before destroying it, sacrificing himself and saving the captain and crew of the \"Enterprise\". However, Data had copied his core memories into B-4, his lost brother who is introduced in the movie. This was done with the reluctant help of La Forge, who voiced concerns about how this could cause B-4 to be nothing more than an exact duplicate of Data.\nIn the of \"Star Trek: Picard\", Data is seen in Picard's dreams, playing poker with him in Ten-Forward, and later painting in the middle of the vineyards of Chateau Picard. It is revealed that Dahj and Soji Asha are Data's daughters, created through fractal neuronic cloning, a procedure developed by Dr. Bruce Maddox. These neurons were apparently salvaged from B-4, who had been dismantled and placed in storage after his positronic net was found to be too primitive to integrate Data's memories. However, Data's consciousness is revealed to still exist inside a quantum simulation crafted by Maddox and based upon memories retrieved from the neurons Maddox salvaged from B-4, the equipment holding the network now in the possession of Altan Soong, Noonien Soong's biological son. After Picard dies, Altan Soong transfers Picard's consciousness into a golem intended for his own consciousness and Picard meets with Data inside the simulation. Data requests that Picard terminate his consciousness, which would allow Data the experience of dying, believing that he could only truly \"live\" if he had a finite lifespan. Once Picard awakens, he carries out Data's wish and Data's consciousness rapidly ages to death, Picard giving a brief eulogy as he observes that what made Data remarkable was his ability to see humanity's worst traits and still aspire to the best parts of the human condition.\nIn the of \"Star Trek: Picard\", Data is revealed to have been revived by Altan within a new synthetic body, having partially merged with Lore, B-4, and the memories of Altan Soong himself. It's believed by Riker that while Data's memories had previously been unrecoverable, the lifting of the ban on synthetics had allowed Soong to work on it more and properly extract them from B-4. The new android was requisitioned by the Daystrom Institute, Starfleet's foremost advanced research center. Riker, Worf, and Raffi Musiker steal the android, and bring him aboard the USS \"Titan\", where he is reunited with Picard. The android entity holds valuable information on Daystrom's research projects, and Data's persona reveals that the antagonists of the season have stolen Picard's original dead organic body. However, it takes several hours for La Forge to re-engineer the android to allow Data's persona to truly dominate it, with Lore's persona dominating in the meantime. Data's persona is seemingly unable to overpower Lore who has taken over the \"Titan\"'s systems, but upon realizing that Lore envied the compassion and empathy Data developed from his memories, Data eventually surrenders them to Lore. Lore initially regards them as his battle trophies; they consume him, reintegrating Lore and reconstituting Data, allowing him to fully take over the new body and reprogram the \"Titan\"'s systems against the Changelings. Data's personality is thus newly enriched, and attains its most human-like state with Data stating that he is Data, but also Lore, B-4, Lal and everything else that Soong had programmed into the android.\nIn the series final episodes, the Changelings are revealed to be working with the Borg who take over Starfleet. Data plays an instrumental role in the final defeat of the Borg, piloting the rebuilt USS \"Enterprise\"-D to the heart of a Borg cube over Jupiter on a gut feeling, a feat that La Forge had believed to be impossible for even a computer or the best pilot to accomplish. Afterwards, Data attempts to adjust to having an artificial organic body and everything that comes with it and is last seen playing poker with his \"Enterprise\" crewmates at the Ten Forward bar in Los Angeles.\nIn \"\" 's \"Fully Dilated,\" an alternate universe version of Data gets trapped in the prime universe. This version of Data, who is purple, is still active in 2382 rather than having been destroyed years earlier and serves on the \"Enterprise\"-D which is similarly still intact. The alternate Data is shown to share many of his prime counterpart's traits and even some of his experiences, such as a close friendship with Geordi La Forge and . After the \"Enterprise\" briefly crosses into the prime universe via a mysterious interdimensional rift \"while battling some evil clones of Tasha Yar, or something,\" Data is left behind and his shuttle crashes on Dilmer III, a pre-industrial planet experiencing time dilation. Data's head -- the only part of his body to survive -- is recovered by Starfleet lieutenants Beckett Mariner, D'Vana Tendi, and T'Lyn, but a transporter mishap strands them on the planet for a year of relative time. During this period, Tendi finds a way to power Data's head and reactivate him and he provides her with advice and help with her science. Data is eventually beamed to the USS \"Cerritos\" where he recommends both Tendi and T'Lyn for the open senior science officer position. The crew load Data's head into a torpedo casing and fire it back through the rift to be recovered by the \"Enterprise\" on the other side.\nSpot.\nSpot is Data's pet cat and a recurring character in the show. Spot appears in several episodes during \"TNG\"'s last four seasons, as well as in the feature films \"Star Trek Generations\" and '. She first appears in the episode \"Data's Day\". Spot originally appears as a male Somali cat, but later appears as a female orange tabby cat, eventually giving birth to kittens (\"TNG\": \"\"). In ', his memories of Spot are the last ones that Data \"surrenders\" to Lore.\nPopular culture.\nLike Spock, Data became a sex symbol and Spiner's fan mail came mostly from women. He described the letters as \"romantic mail\" that were \"really written to Data; he's a really accessible personality\".\nRobotics engineers regard Data (along with the droids from the \"Star Wars\" movies) as the pre-eminent face of robots in the public's perception of their field. On April 9, 2008, Data was inducted into Carnegie Mellon University's Robot Hall of Fame during a ceremony at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nSpiner himself released an album of old pop standards from the 1930s and '40s entitled \"Ol' Yellow Eyes Is Back\", a reference to the contact lenses he wore as Data, as well as a play on the name of the Frank Sinatra album, \"Ol\"' \"Blue Eyes Is Back\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "47687", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47687", "title": "Cosmic ray", "text": "High-energy particle, mainly originating outside the Solar System\nCosmic rays or astroparticles are high-energy particles or clusters of particles (primarily represented by protons or atomic nuclei) that move through space at nearly the speed of light. They originate from the Sun, from outside of the Solar System in the Milky Way, and from distant galaxies. Upon impact with Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays produce showers of secondary particles, some of which reach the surface, although the bulk are deflected off into space by the magnetosphere or the heliosphere.\nCosmic rays were discovered by Victor Hess in 1912 in balloon experiments, for which he was awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nDirect measurement of cosmic rays, especially at lower energies, has been possible since the launch of the first satellites in the late 1950s. Particle detectors similar to those used in nuclear and high-energy physics are used on satellites and space probes for research into cosmic rays. Data from the Fermi Space Telescope (2013) have been interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of primary cosmic rays originate from the supernova explosions of stars. Based on observations of neutrinos and gamma rays from blazar TXS 0506+056 in 2018, active galactic nuclei also appear to produce cosmic rays.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"ray\" (as in optical ray) seems to have arisen from an initial belief, due to their penetrating power, that cosmic rays were mostly electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, following wider recognition of cosmic rays as being various high-energy particles with intrinsic mass, the term \"rays\" is consistent with known particles such as cathode rays, canal rays, alpha rays, and beta rays. Meanwhile \"cosmic\" ray photons, which are quanta of electromagnetic radiation (and so have no intrinsic mass) are known by their common names, such as \"gamma rays\" or \"X-rays\", depending on their photon energy.\nComposition.\nOf primary cosmic rays, which originate outside of Earth's atmosphere, about 99% are the bare nuclei of common atoms (stripped of their electron shells), and about 1% are solitary electrons (that is, one type of beta particle). Of the nuclei, about 90% are simple protons (i.e., hydrogen nuclei); 9% are alpha particles, identical to helium nuclei; and 1% are the nuclei of heavier elements, called HZE ions. These fractions vary highly over the energy range of cosmic rays. A very small fraction are stable particles of antimatter, such as positrons or antiprotons. The precise nature of this remaining fraction is an area of active research. An active search from Earth orbit for anti-alpha particles as of 2019 had found no unequivocal evidence.\nUpon striking the atmosphere, cosmic rays violently burst atoms into other bits of matter, producing large amounts of pions and muons (produced from the decay of charged pions, which have a short half-life) as well as neutrinos. The neutron composition of the particle cascade increases at lower elevations, reaching between 40% and 80% of the radiation at aircraft altitudes.\nOf secondary cosmic rays, the charged pions produced by primary cosmic rays in the atmosphere swiftly decay, emitting muons. Unlike pions, these muons do not interact strongly with matter, and can travel through the atmosphere to penetrate even below ground level. The rate of muons arriving at the surface of the Earth is such that about one per second passes through a volume the size of a person's head. Together with natural local radioactivity, these muons are a significant cause of the ground level atmospheric ionisation that first attracted the attention of scientists, leading to the eventual discovery of the primary cosmic rays arriving from beyond our atmosphere.\nEnergy.\nCosmic rays attract great interest practically, due to the damage they inflict on microelectronics and life outside the protection of an atmosphere and magnetic field, and scientifically, because the energies of the most energetic ultra-high-energy cosmic rays have been observed to approach 3 \u00d7 1020 eV\u2009 (This is slightly greater than 10\u00a0million times the design energy of particles accelerated by the Large Hadron Collider, .) One can show that such enormous energies might be achieved by means of the centrifugal mechanism of acceleration in active galactic nuclei. At , the highest-energy ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (such as the OMG particle recorded in 1991) have energies comparable to the kinetic energy of a baseball. As a result of these discoveries, there has been interest in investigating cosmic rays of even greater energies. Most cosmic rays, however, do not have such extreme energies; the energy distribution of cosmic rays peaks at .\nHistory.\nAfter the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896, it was generally believed that atmospheric electricity, ionization of the air, was caused only by radiation from radioactive elements in the ground or the radioactive gases or isotopes of radon they produce. Measurements of increasing ionization rates at increasing heights above the ground during the decade from 1900 to 1910 could be explained as due to absorption of the ionizing radiation by the intervening air.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1909, Theodor Wulf developed an electrometer, a device to measure the rate of ion production inside a hermetically sealed container, and used it to show higher levels of radiation at the top of the Eiffel Tower than at its base. However, his paper published in \"Physikalische Zeitschrift\" was not widely accepted. In 1911, Domenico Pacini observed simultaneous variations of the rate of ionization over a lake, over the sea, and at a depth of 3 metres from the surface. Pacini concluded from the decrease of radioactivity underwater that a certain part of the ionization must be due to sources other than the radioactivity of the Earth.\nIn 1912, Victor Hess carried three enhanced-accuracy Wulf electrometers to an altitude of 5,300\u00a0metres in a free balloon flight. He found the ionization rate increased to twice the rate at ground level. Hess ruled out the Sun as the radiation's source by making a balloon ascent during a near-total eclipse. With the moon blocking much of the Sun's visible radiation, Hess still measured rising radiation at rising altitudes. He concluded that \"The results of the observations seem most likely to be explained by the assumption that radiation of very high penetrating power enters from above into our atmosphere.\" In 1913\u20131914, Werner Kolh\u00f6rster confirmed Victor Hess's earlier results by measuring the increased ionization enthalpy rate at an altitude of 9\u00a0km. Hess received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936 for his discovery.\nIdentification.\nBruno Rossi wrote in 1964:\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s the technique of self-recording electroscopes carried by balloons into the highest layers of the atmosphere or sunk to great depths under water was brought to an unprecedented degree of perfection by the German physicist Erich Regener and his group. To these scientists we owe some of the most accurate measurements ever made of cosmic-ray ionization as a function of altitude and depth.\nErnest Rutherford stated in 1931 that \"thanks to the fine experiments of Professor Millikan and the even more far-reaching experiments of Professor Regener, we have now got for the first time, a curve of absorption of these radiations in water which we may safely rely upon\".\nIn the 1920s, the term \"cosmic ray\" was coined by Robert Millikan who made measurements of ionization due to cosmic rays from deep under water to high altitudes and around the globe. Millikan believed that his measurements proved that the primary cosmic rays were gamma rays; i.e., energetic photons. And he proposed a theory that they were produced in interstellar space as by-products of the fusion of hydrogen atoms into the heavier elements, and that secondary electrons were produced in the atmosphere by Compton scattering of gamma rays. In 1927, while sailing from Java to the Netherlands, Jacob Clay found evidence, later confirmed in many experiments, that cosmic ray intensity increases from the tropics to mid-latitudes, which indicated that the primary cosmic rays are deflected by the geomagnetic field and must therefore be charged particles, not photons. In 1929, Bothe and Kolh\u00f6rster discovered charged cosmic-ray particles that could penetrate 4.1\u00a0cm of gold. Charged particles of such high energy could not possibly be produced by photons from Millikan's proposed interstellar fusion process.\nIn 1930, Bruno Rossi predicted a difference between the intensities of cosmic rays arriving from the east and the west that depends upon the charge of the primary particles\u2014the so-called \"east\u2013west effect\". Three independent experiments found that the intensity is, in fact, greater from the west, proving that most primaries are positive. During the years from 1930 to 1945, a wide variety of investigations confirmed that the primary cosmic rays are mostly protons, and the secondary radiation produced in the atmosphere is primarily electrons, photons and muons. In 1948, observations with nuclear emulsions carried by balloons to near the top of the atmosphere showed that approximately 10% of the primaries are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and 1% are nuclei of heavier elements such as carbon, iron, and lead.\nDuring a test of his equipment for measuring the east\u2013west effect, Rossi observed that the rate of near-simultaneous discharges of two widely separated Geiger counters was larger than the expected accidental rate. In his report on the experiment, Rossi wrote \"...\u00a0it seems that once in a while the recording equipment is struck by very extensive showers of particles, which causes coincidences between the counters, even placed at large distances from one another.\" In 1937, Pierre Auger, unaware of Rossi's earlier report, detected the same phenomenon and investigated it in some detail. He concluded that high-energy primary cosmic-ray particles interact with air nuclei high in the atmosphere, initiating a cascade of secondary interactions that ultimately yield a shower of electrons, and photons that reach ground level.\nSoviet physicist Sergei Vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings with an instrument carried to high altitude by a balloon. On 1 April 1935, he took measurements at heights up to 13.6 kilometres using a pair of Geiger counters in an anti-coincidence circuit to avoid counting secondary ray showers.\nHomi J. Bhabha derived an expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as Bhabha scattering. His classic paper, jointly with Walter Heitler, published in 1937 described how primary cosmic rays from space interact with the upper atmosphere to produce particles observed at the ground level. Bhabha and Heitler explained the cosmic ray shower formation by the cascade production of gamma rays and positive and negative electron pairs.\nEnergy distribution.\nMeasurements of the energy and arrival directions of the ultra-high-energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of \"density sampling\" and \"fast timing\" of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 by members of the Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The experiment employed eleven scintillation detectors arranged within a circle 460 metres in diameter on the grounds of the Agassiz Station of the Harvard College Observatory. From that work, and from many other experiments carried out all over the world, the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 1020\u00a0eV. A huge air shower experiment called the Auger Project is currently operated at a site on the Pampas of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists. The project was first led by James Cronin, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics from the University of Chicago, and Alan Watson of the University of Leeds, and later by scientists of the international Pierre Auger Collaboration. Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest-energy primary cosmic rays. The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology, due to a theoretical Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuzmin limit to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances (about 160 million light years) which occurs above 1020\u00a0eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the Big Bang origin of the universe. Currently the Pierre Auger Observatory is undergoing an upgrade to improve its accuracy and find evidence for the yet unconfirmed origin of the most energetic cosmic rays.\nHigh-energy gamma rays (&gt;50MeV photons) were finally discovered in the primary cosmic radiation by an MIT experiment carried on the OSO-3 satellite in 1967. Components of both galactic and extra-galactic origins were separately identified at intensities much less than 1% of the primary charged particles. Since then, numerous satellite gamma-ray observatories have mapped the gamma-ray sky. The most recent is the Fermi Observatory, which has produced a map showing a narrow band of gamma ray intensity produced in discrete and diffuse sources in our galaxy, and numerous point-like extra-galactic sources distributed over the celestial sphere.\nSolar modulation.\nSolar modulation theory explains how the intensity of cosmic rays changes as they travel through the heliosphere, influenced by the solar wind and magnetic field. The solar cycle causes variations in the magnetic field of the solar wind through which cosmic rays propagate to Earth. Solar modulation is a quasiperiodical change in cosmic rays intensity caused by 11- and 22-year cycles of solar activity.\nParker transport equation.\nThe Parker transport equation (also called the Parker equation, for Eugene Parker) is a kinetic equation that describes the acceleration and transport of energetic particles in astrophysical plasmas. The equation comprises diffusion terms both in coordinate space and in momentum space. The equation is used for studying energetic particle transport, and the mechanism of cosmic ray acceleration can be derived from it (diffusive shock acceleration). The equation is also used \"to study the acceleration of cosmic rays at supernova remnant shocks, the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles at shocks driven by coronal mass ejections, and the acceleration and transport of energetic particles at the solar wind termination shock\".\nThe Parker transport equation in one dimension is:\nformula_1\nwhere:\nSources.\nEarly speculation on the sources of cosmic rays included a 1934 proposal by Baade and Zwicky suggesting cosmic rays originated from supernovae. A 1948 proposal by Horace W. Babcock suggested that magnetic variable stars could be a source of cosmic rays. Subsequently, Sekido \"et al.\" (1951) identified the Crab Nebula as a source of cosmic rays. Since then, a wide variety of potential sources for cosmic rays began to surface, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, quasars, and gamma-ray bursts.\nLater experiments have helped to identify the sources of cosmic rays with greater certainty. In 2009, a paper presented at the International Cosmic Ray Conference by scientists at the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina showed ultra-high energy cosmic rays originating from a location in the sky very close to the radio galaxy Centaurus A, although the authors specifically stated that further investigation would be required to confirm Centaurus\u00a0A as a source of cosmic rays. However, no correlation was found between the incidence of gamma-ray bursts and cosmic rays, causing the authors to set upper limits as low as 3.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00d7\u00a0erg\u00b7cm\u22122 on the flux of 1 GeV \u2013 1 TeV cosmic rays from gamma-ray bursts.\nIn 2009, supernovae were said to have been \"pinned down\" as a source of cosmic rays, a discovery made by a group using data from the Very Large Telescope. This analysis, however, was disputed in 2011 with data from PAMELA, which revealed that \"spectral shapes of [hydrogen and helium nuclei] are different and cannot be described well by a single power law\", suggesting a more complex process of cosmic ray formation. In February 2013, though, research analyzing data from \"Fermi\" revealed through an observation of neutral pion decay that supernovae were indeed a source of cosmic rays, with each explosion producing roughly 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01042 \u2013 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01043J of cosmic rays.\nSupernovae do not produce all cosmic rays, however, and the proportion of cosmic rays that they do produce is a question which cannot be answered without deeper investigation. To explain the actual process in supernovae and active galactic nuclei that accelerates the stripped atoms, physicists use shock front acceleration as a plausibility argument (see picture at right).\nIn 2017, the Pierre Auger Collaboration published the observation of a weak anisotropy in the arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays. Since the Galactic Center is in the deficit region, this anisotropy can be interpreted as evidence for the extragalactic origin of cosmic rays at the highest energies. This implies that there must be a transition energy from galactic to extragalactic sources, and there may be different types of cosmic-ray sources contributing to different energy ranges.\nTypes.\nCosmic rays can be divided into two types:\nHowever, the term \"cosmic ray\" is often used to refer to only the extrasolar flux.\nCosmic rays originate as primary cosmic rays, which are those originally produced in various astrophysical processes. Primary cosmic rays are composed mainly of protons and alpha particles (99%), with a small amount of heavier nuclei (\u22481%) and an extremely minute proportion of positrons and antiprotons. Secondary cosmic rays, caused by a decay of primary cosmic rays as they impact an atmosphere, include photons, hadrons, and leptons, such as electrons, positrons, muons, and pions. The latter three of these were first detected in cosmic rays.\nPrimary cosmic rays.\nPrimary cosmic rays mostly originate from outside the Solar System and sometimes even outside the Milky Way. When they interact with Earth's atmosphere, they are converted to secondary particles. The mass ratio of helium to hydrogen nuclei, 28%, is similar to the primordial elemental abundance ratio of these elements, 24%. The remaining fraction is made up of the other heavier nuclei that are typical nucleosynthesis end products, primarily lithium, beryllium, and boron. These nuclei appear in cosmic rays in greater abundance (\u22481%) than in the solar atmosphere, where they are only about 10\u22123 as abundant (by number) as helium. Cosmic rays composed of charged nuclei heavier than helium are called HZE ions. Due to the high charge and heavy nature of HZE ions, their contribution to an astronaut's radiation dose in space is significant even though they are relatively scarce.\nThis abundance difference is a result of the way in which secondary cosmic rays are formed. Carbon and oxygen nuclei collide with interstellar matter to form lithium, beryllium, and boron, an example of cosmic ray spallation. Spallation is also responsible for the abundances of scandium, titanium, vanadium, and manganese ions in cosmic rays produced by collisions of iron and nickel nuclei with interstellar matter.\nAt high energies the composition changes and heavier nuclei have larger abundances in some energy ranges. Current experiments aim at more accurate measurements of the composition at high energies.\nPrimary cosmic ray antimatter.\nSatellite experiments have found evidence of positrons and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. These do not appear to be the products of large amounts of antimatter from the Big Bang, or indeed complex antimatter in the universe. Rather, they appear to consist of only these two elementary particles, newly made in energetic processes.\nPreliminary results from the presently operating Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (\"AMS-02\") on board the International Space Station show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality. In September 2014, new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at CERN and published in Physical Review Letters. A new measurement of positron fraction up to 500 GeV was reported, showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron+positron events, around an energy of 275 \u00b1 32 GeV. At higher energies, up to 500\u00a0GeV, the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again. The absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before 500\u00a0GeV, but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies, which peak about 10\u00a0GeV. These results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive dark matter particles.\nCosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher average energy than their normal-matter counterparts (protons). They arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2\u00a0GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.\nThere is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei, such as antihelium nuclei (i.e., anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. These are actively being searched for. A prototype of the \"AMS-02\" designated \"AMS-01\", was flown into space aboard the Space Shuttle \"Discovery\" on STS-91 in June 1998. By not detecting any antihelium at all, the \"AMS-01\" established an upper limit of 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 for the antihelium to helium flux ratio.\nSecondary cosmic rays.\nWhen cosmic rays enter the Earth's atmosphere, they collide with atoms and molecules, mainly oxygen and nitrogen. The interaction produces a cascade of lighter particles, a so-called air shower secondary radiation that rains down, including x-rays, protons, alpha particles, pions, muons, electrons, neutrinos, and neutrons. All of the secondary particles produced by the collision continue onward on paths within about one degree of the primary particle's original path.\nTypical particles produced in such collisions are neutrons and charged mesons such as positive or negative pions and kaons. Some of these subsequently decay into muons and neutrinos, which are able to reach the surface of the Earth. Some high-energy muons even penetrate for some distance into shallow mines, and most neutrinos traverse the Earth without further interaction. Others decay into photons, subsequently producing electromagnetic cascades. Hence, next to photons, electrons and positrons usually dominate in air showers. These particles as well as muons can be easily detected by many types of particle detectors, such as cloud chambers, bubble chambers, water-Cherenkov, or scintillation detectors. The observation of a secondary shower of particles in multiple detectors at the same time is an indication that all of the particles came from that event.\nCosmic rays impacting other planetary bodies in the Solar System are detected indirectly by observing high-energy gamma ray emissions by gamma-ray telescope. These are distinguished from radioactive decay processes by their higher energies above about 10\u00a0MeV.\nCosmic-ray flux.\nThe flux of incoming cosmic rays at the upper atmosphere is dependent on the solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field, and the energy of the cosmic rays. At distances of \u224894\u00a0AU from the Sun, the solar wind undergoes a transition, called the termination shock, from supersonic to subsonic speeds. The region between the termination shock and the heliopause acts as a barrier to cosmic rays, decreasing the flux at lower energies (\u2264\u00a01\u00a0GeV) by about\u00a090%. However, the strength of the solar wind is not constant, and hence it has been observed that cosmic ray flux is correlated with solar activity.\nIn addition, the Earth's magnetic field acts to deflect cosmic rays from its surface, giving rise to the observation that the flux is apparently dependent on latitude, longitude, and azimuth angle.\nThe combined effects of all of the factors mentioned contribute to the flux of cosmic rays at Earth's surface. The following table of participial frequencies reach the planet and are inferred from lower-energy radiation reaching the ground.\nIn the past, it was believed that the cosmic ray flux remained fairly constant over time. However, recent research suggests one-and-a-half- to two-fold millennium-timescale changes in the cosmic ray flux in the past forty thousand years.\nThe magnitude of the energy of cosmic ray flux in interstellar space is very comparable to that of other deep space energies: cosmic ray energy density averages about one electron-volt per cubic centimetre of interstellar space, or \u22481\u00a0eV/cm3, which is comparable to the energy density of visible starlight at 0.3\u00a0eV/cm3, the galactic magnetic field energy density (assumed 3\u00a0microgauss) which is \u22480.25\u00a0eV/cm3, or the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation energy density at \u22480.25\u00a0eV/cm3.\nDetection methods.\nThere are two main classes of detection methods. First, the direct detection of the primary cosmic rays in space or at high altitude by balloon-borne instruments. Second, the indirect detection of secondary particle, i.e., extensive air showers at higher energies. While there have been proposals and prototypes for space and balloon-borne detection of air showers, currently operating experiments for high-energy cosmic rays are ground based. Generally direct detection is more accurate than indirect detection. However the flux of cosmic rays decreases with energy, which hampers direct detection for the energy range above 1 PeV. Both direct and indirect detection are realized by several techniques.\nDirect detection.\nDirect detection is possible by all kinds of particle detectors at the ISS, on satellites, or high-altitude balloons. However, there are constraints in weight and size limiting the choices of detectors.\nAn example for the direct detection technique is a method based on nuclear tracks developed by Robert Fleischer, P.\u00a0Buford Price, and Robert\u00a0M. Walker for use in high-altitude balloons. In this method, sheets of clear plastic, like 0.25\u00a0mm Lexan polycarbonate, are stacked together and exposed directly to cosmic rays in space or high altitude. The nuclear charge causes chemical bond breaking or ionization in the plastic. At the top of the plastic stack the ionization is less, due to the high cosmic ray speed. As the cosmic ray speed decreases due to deceleration in the stack, the ionization increases along the path. The resulting plastic sheets are \"etched\" or slowly dissolved in warm caustic sodium hydroxide solution, that removes the surface material at a slow, known rate. The caustic sodium hydroxide dissolves the plastic at a faster rate along the path of the ionized plastic. The net result is a conical etch pit in the plastic. The etch pits are measured under a high-power microscope (typically 1600\u00d7 oil-immersion), and the etch rate is plotted as a function of the depth in the stacked plastic.\nThis technique yields a unique curve for each atomic nucleus from 1 to\u00a092, allowing identification of both the charge and energy of the cosmic ray that traverses the plastic stack. The more extensive the ionization along the path, the higher the charge. In addition to its uses for cosmic-ray detection, the technique is also used to detect nuclei created as products of nuclear fission.\nIndirect detection.\nThere are several ground-based methods of detecting cosmic rays currently in use, which can be divided in two main categories: the detection of secondary particles forming extensive air showers (EAS) by various types of particle detectors, and the detection of electromagnetic radiation emitted by EAS in the atmosphere.\nExtensive air shower arrays made of particle detectors measure the charged particles which pass through them. EAS arrays can observe a broad area of the sky and can be active more than 90% of the time. However, they are less able to segregate background effects from cosmic rays than can air Cherenkov telescopes. Most state-of-the-art EAS arrays employ plastic scintillators. Also water (liquid or frozen) is used as a detection medium through which particles pass and produce Cherenkov radiation to make them detectable. Therefore, several arrays use water/ice-Cherenkov detectors as alternative or in addition to scintillators.\nBy the combination of several detectors, some EAS arrays have the capability to distinguish muons from lighter secondary particles (photons, electrons, positrons). The fraction of muons among the secondary particles is one traditional way to estimate the mass composition of the primary cosmic rays.\nAn historic method of secondary particle detection still used for demonstration purposes involves the use of cloud chambers to detect the secondary muons created when a pion decays. Cloud chambers in particular can be built from widely available materials and can be constructed even in a high-school laboratory. A fifth method, involving bubble chambers, can be used to detect cosmic ray particles.\nMore recently, the CMOS devices in pervasive smartphone cameras have been proposed as a practical distributed network to detect air showers from ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The first app to exploit this proposition was the CRAYFIS (Cosmic RAYs Found in Smartphones) experiment. In 2017, the CREDO (Cosmic-Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory) Collaboration released the first version of its completely open source app for Android devices. Since then the collaboration has attracted the interest and support of many scientific institutions, educational institutions, and members of the public around the world. Future research has to show in what aspects this new technique can compete with dedicated EAS arrays.\nThe first detection method in the second category is called the air Cherenkov telescope, designed to detect low-energy (&lt;200\u00a0GeV) cosmic rays by means of analyzing their Cherenkov radiation, which for cosmic rays are gamma rays emitted as they travel faster than the speed of light in their medium, the atmosphere. While these telescopes are extremely good at distinguishing between background radiation and that of cosmic-ray origin, they can only function well on clear nights without the Moon shining, have very small fields of view, and are only active for a few percent of the time.\nA second method detects the light from nitrogen fluorescence caused by the excitation of nitrogen in the atmosphere by particles moving through the atmosphere. This method is the most accurate for cosmic rays at highest energies, in particular when combined with EAS arrays of particle detectors. Similar to the detection of Cherenkov-light, this method is restricted to clear nights.\nAnother method detects radio waves emitted by air showers. This technique has a high duty cycle similar to that of particle detectors. The accuracy of this technique was improved in the last years as shown by various prototype experiments, and may become an alternative to the detection of atmospheric Cherenkov-light and fluorescence light, at least at high energies.\nEffects.\nChanges in atmospheric chemistry.\nCosmic rays ionize nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, which leads to a number of chemical reactions. Cosmic rays are also responsible for the continuous production of a number of unstable isotopes, such as carbon-14, in the Earth's atmosphere through the reaction:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;n + 14N \u2192 p + 14C\nCosmic rays kept the level of carbon-14 in the atmosphere roughly constant (70 tons) for at least the past 100,000 years, until the beginning of above-ground nuclear weapons testing in the early 1950s. This fact is used in radiocarbon dating.\nRole in ambient radiation.\nCosmic rays constitute a fraction of the annual radiation exposure of human beings on the Earth, averaging 0.39mSv out of a total of 3mSv per year (13% of total background) for the Earth's population. However, the background radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude, from 0.3mSv per year for sea-level areas to 1.0mSv per year for higher-altitude cities, raising cosmic radiation exposure to a quarter of total background radiation exposure for populations of said cities. Airline crews flying long-distance high-altitude routes can be exposed to 2.2mSv of extra radiation each year due to cosmic rays, nearly doubling their total exposure to ionizing radiation.\nEffect on electronics.\nCosmic rays have sufficient energy to alter the states of circuit components in electronic integrated circuits, causing transient errors to occur (such as corrupted data in electronic memory devices or incorrect performance of CPUs) often referred to as \"soft errors\". This has been a problem in electronics at extremely high-altitude, such as in satellites, but with transistors becoming smaller and smaller, this is becoming an increasing concern in ground-level electronics as well. Studies by IBM in the 1990s suggest that computers typically experience about one cosmic-ray-induced error per 256 megabytes of RAM per month. To alleviate this problem, the Intel Corporation has proposed a cosmic ray detector that could be integrated into future high-density microprocessors, allowing the processor to repeat the last command following a cosmic-ray event. ECC memory is used to protect data against data corruption caused by cosmic rays.\nIn 2008, data corruption in a flight control system caused an Airbus A330 airliner to twice plunge hundreds of feet, resulting in injuries to multiple passengers and crew members. Cosmic rays were investigated among other possible causes of the data corruption, but were ultimately ruled out as being very unlikely.\nIn August 2020, scientists reported that ionizing radiation from environmental radioactive materials and cosmic rays may substantially limit the coherence times of qubits if they are not shielded adequately which may be critical for realizing fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers in the future.\nSignificance to aerospace travel.\nGalactic cosmic rays are one of the most important barriers standing in the way of plans for interplanetary travel by crewed spacecraft. Cosmic rays also pose a threat to electronics placed aboard outgoing probes. In 2010, a malfunction aboard the \"Voyager 2\" space probe was credited to a single flipped bit, probably caused by a cosmic ray. Strategies such as physical or magnetic shielding for spacecraft have been considered in order to minimize the damage to electronics and human beings caused by cosmic rays.\nOn 31 May 2013, NASA scientists reported that a possible crewed mission to Mars may involve a greater radiation risk than previously believed, based on the amount of energetic particle radiation detected by the RAD on the Mars Science Laboratory while traveling from the Earth to Mars in 2011\u20132012.\nFlying high, passengers and crews of jet airliners are exposed to at least 10 times the cosmic ray dose that people at sea level receive. Aircraft flying polar routes near the geomagnetic poles are at particular risk.\nRole in lightning.\nCosmic rays have been implicated in the triggering of electrical breakdown in lightning. It has been proposed that essentially all lightning is triggered through a relativistic process, or \"runaway breakdown\", seeded by cosmic ray secondaries. Subsequent development of the lightning discharge then occurs through \"conventional breakdown\" mechanisms.\nPostulated role in climate change.\nA role for cosmic rays in climate was suggested by Edward P. Ney in 1959 and by Robert E. Dickinson in 1975. It has been postulated that cosmic rays may have been responsible for major climatic change and mass extinction in the past. According to Adrian Mellott and Mikhail Medvedev, 62-million-year cycles in biological marine populations correlate with the motion of the Earth relative to the galactic plane and increases in exposure to cosmic rays. The researchers suggest that this and gamma ray bombardments deriving from local supernovae could have affected cancer and mutation rates, and might be linked to decisive alterations in the Earth's climate, and to the mass extinctions of the Ordovician.\nDanish physicist Henrik Svensmark has controversially argued that because solar variation modulates the cosmic ray flux on Earth, it would consequently affect the rate of cloud formation and hence be an indirect cause of global warming. Svensmark is one of several scientists outspokenly opposed to the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming, leading to concerns that the proposition that cosmic rays are connected to global warming could be ideologically biased rather than scientifically based. Other scientists have vigorously criticized Svensmark for sloppy and inconsistent work: one example is adjustment of cloud data that understates error in lower cloud data, but not in high cloud data; another example is \"incorrect handling of the physical data\" resulting in graphs that do not show the correlations they claim to show. Despite Svensmark's assertions, galactic cosmic rays have shown no statistically significant influence on changes in cloud cover, and have been demonstrated in studies to have no causal relationship to changes in global temperature.\nPossible mass extinction factor.\nA handful of studies conclude that a nearby supernova or series of supernovas caused the Pliocene marine megafauna extinction event by substantially increasing radiation levels to hazardous amounts for large seafaring animals.\nResearch and experiments.\nThere are a number of cosmic-ray research initiatives, listed below.\nGround-based.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSatellite.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBalloon-borne.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The attacker usually aims to capture one of the forked pieces. The defender often cannot counter every threat. A fork is most effective when it is &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;forcing&lt;/dfn&gt;, such as when the king is put in check. A fork is a type of &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;double attack&lt;/dfn&gt;.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC_left/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTerminology.\nA fork is an example of a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;double attack&lt;/dfn&gt;. The type of fork is named after the type of forking piece. For example, a fork by a knight is a \"knight fork\". The attacked pieces are \"forked\". If the king is one of the attacked pieces, the term \"absolute fork\" is sometimes used, while a fork not involving the enemy king is a \"relative fork\".\nA fork of the king and queen, the highest &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;material&lt;/dfn&gt;-gaining fork possible, is sometimes called a \"royal fork\". A fork of the enemy king, queen, and one (or both) rooks is sometimes called a \"grand fork\". A knight fork of the enemy king, queen, and possibly other pieces is sometimes called a \"family fork\" or \"family check\".\nStrategy.\nWhile any piece can deliver a fork, knights are particularly effective as the forking piece because they cannot be captured by the non-knight pieces they attack, and as a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;minor piece&lt;/dfn&gt; they are less valuable than rooks and queens.\nCompared to forks by other pieces, a queen fork requires more specific conditions to be helpful due to the queen's higher value. A queen fork can often lead to material or positional gain, however, when the forked pieces are undefended, poorly coordinated, or when one piece is the king.\nGame examples.\nThis example is from the first round of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 between Mohamed Tissir and Alexey Dreev.

This similarity led to legal action being taken by the rival Seven Network, which at the time was set to debut an Australian version of \"Ground Force\". Seven ultimately lost its claim as Don Burke's CTC was able to argue that Burke's previous program \"Burke's Backyard\" had featured backyard garden renovations, which they claimed naturally morphed into the \"Backyard Blitz\" concept.\nThe four regular presenters on the show were landscaper Jamie Durie (the main host and the show's lead landscaper), Scott Cam (builder/carpenter), Nigel Ruck (landscaper) and Jody Rigby (horticulturist). The show launched the television careers of Durie, Rigby and Cam. Durie and Cam later become hosts of Nine's successful reality television show \"The Block\" during different seasons.\nDuring its run the show was immensely popular across all demographics; it regularly won its time slot and consistently ranked in the top 20 national shows at year's end. On 14 November 2006 \"Backyard Blitz\" was axed by the Nine Network after seven years on air. Don Burke, whose own show \"Burke's Backyard\" was broadcast by Nine for nearly 18 years before it was axed in 2004, said his production company was \"quite shocked by this decision\". In mid-2007 Nine aired the six remaining unaired episodes that were filmed before the show was cancelled.\nIn 2008, Nine started airing a spin-off show called \"Domestic Blitz\", hosted by Cam and Shelley Craft.

{"id": "47694", "revid": "205204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47694", "title": "Pin (chess)", "text": "Tactic in the game of chess\nIn chess, a pin is a tactic in which a defending piece cannot move out of an attacking piece's line of attack without exposing a more valuable defending piece. Moving the attacking piece to effect the pin is called \"pinning\"; the defending piece restricted by the pin is described as \"pinned\". Only a piece that can move any number of squares along a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line (i.e. a bishop, rook, or queen) can pin. Any piece can be pinned except the king. The pin is one of the most powerful chess tactics. \nThe inverse of a pin is a \"skewer\", in which a more valuable piece under direct attack may move to expose a less valuable piece to an attack.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC_left/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTypes.\nAbsolute pin.\nAn \"absolute pin\" is one where the piece shielded by the pinned piece is the king. In this case it is illegal to move the pinned piece out of the line of attack, as that would place one's king in check (see diagram). A piece pinned in this way can still give check or defend another piece from capture by the opposing king.\nEven if a piece is in an absolute pin, moving the king to a square where it would be attacked by said piece is still illegal. Because of this, an absolutely pinned piece can still help to checkmate the enemy king in rare circumstances.\nRelative pin.\nA \"relative pin\" is one where the piece shielded by the pinned piece is a piece other than the king, but typically is more valuable than the pinned piece. Moving such a pinned piece is legal but may not be prudent, as the shielded piece would then be vulnerable to capture if the pinned piece moving does not put the opponent\u2019s king in check.\nPartial pin.\nIndependently of whether it is absolute or relative, a pin might be a \"partial pin\", in which the pinned piece can still move along the line of the pin, and it might be able to capture the piece that is pinning it, but it cannot leave that line. For example, a rook or queen can be partially pinned along a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;file&lt;/dfn&gt; or &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;rank&lt;/dfn&gt;, or a bishop or queen can be partially pinned along a &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;diagonal&lt;/dfn&gt;. Capturing the pinning piece can still be advantageous to the pinning player, as in the example diagram (the pinning rook is defended, so capturing it with the queen would lose &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;material&lt;/dfn&gt;).\nA queen can only ever be partially pinned, as she can move in any linear direction, while a knight can only be completely pinned due to its unique movement. The pawn is a more complex case; due to its limited and conditional movement, whether a pin on a pawn is partial depends on the line and direction of the pin and on whether there are opposing pieces available for it to capture.\nIt is possible for two opposing pieces to be partially pinning each other.\nSituational pin.\nSometimes a piece may be considered to be in a \"situational pin\". Like a relative pin, a situational pin does not legally restrict the piece from moving, but moving the pinned piece out of the line of attack can result in some detriment to the player (e.g. checkmate, immediate loss of the game, occupation of a critical square by the opponent, etc.).\nConsider the diagrammed position with White to move. The black bishop on d5 is unprotected and White can capture it with 1.Nxd5; however, White should not play the capture or otherwise move the knight, due to the skewer attack 1...Rb1+ winning White's rook (the king is forced to move, then 2...Rxh1). It can be said that the white knight is \"pinned to the b1-square\" rather than pinned to a piece.\nCross-pin.\nA \"cross-pin\" consists of two or more pins, of any type, on the same piece. As there is only one king per side, only one of the pins can be absolute, but there are otherwise no restrictions on the types of pins involved.\nPin combinations.\nPinning can also be used in combination with other tactics. For example, a piece can be pinned to prevent it from moving to attack, or a defending piece can be pinned as part of tactic undermining an opponent's defense. Another tactic which takes advantage of a pin can be called \"working the pin\". In this tactic, other pieces from the pinning piece's side attack the opposing pinned piece. Since the pinned piece cannot move out of the line of attack, the player whose piece is pinned may move other pieces to defend the pinned piece, but the pinning player may yet attack with even more pieces, etc. Using a battery of doubled rooks with a queen behind them to this end is known as Alekhine's gun.\nA pinned piece can usually no longer be counted on as a defender of another friendly piece or as an attacker of an opposing piece (unless the subject is still within the pinning line). However, a pinned piece can still give check to the opposing king, and therefore can still defend friendly pieces against captures made by the enemy king.\nUnpinning.\nBreaking a pin is called \"unpinning\". This can be done in a number of ways: the piece creating the pin can be captured or chased away; another unit can be moved to block the line of the pin; the unit to which a piece is pinned can be moved; or, a relatively pinned piece can move despite the pin, such as in the L\u00e9gal Trap and the Elephant Trap.\nPins commonly seen in gameplay.\nA pinning move that often occurs in openings is Bb5 which, if Black has moved ...Nc6 and ...d6 or ...d5, pins the knight on c6, since moving the knight would expose the king on e8 to check. The same may occur on the other &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;flank&lt;/dfn&gt;, with a bishop on g5; or by Black on White, with a bishop on b4 or g4.\nExamples from games.\nThe diagram shows Vladimir Lenin\u2013Maxim Gorky, Capri 1908, with White to move. Black is threatening the following rook sacrifice and &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;forced mate&lt;/dfn&gt;: \n27...Rh1+ 28.Kxh1 Qh2#\nWhite cannot play 27.gxh3, because the queen on g3 is pinning the pawn to the g-file. The only move that postpones the mate is 27.Nf4, which temporarily blocks Black's bishop from protecting his queen, but to no avail as Black can simply play 27...Bxf4 renewing the mate threat. Or, Black can respond by mating a different way: \n27.Nf4 Qh2+ 28.Kf2 Rhxf3#\nIn this case, White cannot capture 29.gxf3 because the queen now on h2 pins the pawn to the 2nd rank. With mate being inevitable, White resigned after move 26.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
