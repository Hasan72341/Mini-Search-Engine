{"id": "52247", "revid": "12331483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52247", "title": "Fourier transform", "text": "Mathematical transform that expresses a function of time as a function of frequency\nIn mathematics, the Fourier transform (FT) is an integral transform that takes a function as input, and outputs another function that describes the extent to which various frequencies are present in the original function. The output of the transform is a complex-valued function of frequency. The term \"Fourier transform\" refers to both the mathematical operation and to this complex-valued function. When a distinction needs to be made, the output of the operation is sometimes called the frequency domain representation of the original function. The Fourier transform is analogous to decomposing the sound of a musical chord into the intensities of its constituent pitches.\nFunctions that are localized in the time domain have Fourier transforms that are spread out across the frequency domain and vice versa, a phenomenon known as the uncertainty principle. The critical case for this principle is the Gaussian function, of substantial importance in probability theory and statistics as well as in the study of physical phenomena exhibiting normal distribution (e.g., diffusion). The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is another Gaussian function. Joseph Fourier introduced sine and cosine transforms (which correspond to the imaginary and real components of the modern Fourier transform) in his study of heat transfer, where Gaussian functions appear as solutions of the heat equation.\nThe Fourier transform can be formally defined as an improper Riemann integral, making it an integral transform, although this definition is not suitable for many applications requiring a more sophisticated integration theory. For example, many relatively simple applications use the Dirac delta function, which can be treated formally as if it were a function, but the justification requires a mathematically more sophisticated viewpoint.\nThe Fourier transform can also be generalized to functions of several variables on Euclidean space, sending a function of 3-dimensional \"position space\" to a function of 3-dimensional momentum (or a function of space and time to a function of 4-momentum). This idea makes the spatial Fourier transform very natural in the study of waves, as well as in quantum mechanics, where it is important to be able to represent wave solutions as functions of either position or momentum and sometimes both. In general, functions to which Fourier methods are applicable are complex-valued, and possibly vector-valued. Still further generalization is possible to functions on groups, which, besides the original Fourier transform on R or R\"n\", notably includes the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT, group = Z), the discrete Fourier transform (DFT, group = Z mod \"N\") and the Fourier series or circular Fourier transform (group = \"S\"1, the unit circle \u2248 closed finite interval with endpoints identified). The latter is routinely employed to handle periodic functions. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm for computing the DFT.\nDefinition.\nThe Fourier transform of a complex-valued function formula_1 on the real line, is the complex valued function formula_2, defined by the integral\nFourier transform\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn this case formula_1 is (Lebesgue) integrable over the whole real line, i.e., the above integral converges to a continuous function formula_2 at all formula_5 (decaying to zero as formula_6). \nHowever, the Fourier transform can also be defined for (generalized) functions for which the Lebesgue integral Eq.1 does not make sense. Interpreting the integral suitably (e.g. as an improper integral for locally integrable functions) extends the Fourier transform to functions that are not necessarily integrable over the whole real line. More generally, the Fourier transform also applies to generalized functions like the Dirac delta (and all other tempered distributions), in which case it is defined by duality rather than an integral.\nFirst introduced in Fourier's \"Analytical Theory of Heat\"., the corresponding inversion formula for \"sufficiently nice\" functions is given by the Fourier inversion theorem, i.e., \nInverse transform\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe functions formula_7 and formula_8 are referred to as a Fourier transform pair.\u00a0 A common notation for designating transform pairs is:\nformula_9\nFor example, the Fourier transform of the delta function is the constant function formula_10:\nformula_11\nAngular frequency (\"\u03c9\").\nWhen the independent variable (formula_12) represents \"time\" (often denoted by formula_13), the transform variable (formula_5) represents frequency (often denoted by formula_7). For example, if time has the unit second, then frequency has the unit hertz. The transform variable can also be written in terms of angular frequency, formula_16 with the unit radian per second.\nThe substitution formula_17 into Eq.1 produces this convention, where function formula_18 is relabeled formula_19\nformula_20\nUnlike the Eq.1 definition, the Fourier transform is no longer a unitary transformation, and there is less symmetry between the formulas for the transform and its inverse. Those properties are restored by splitting the formula_21 factor evenly between the transform and its inverse, which leads to another convention:\nformula_22\nVariations of all three conventions can be created by conjugating the complex-exponential kernel of both the forward and the reverse transform. The signs must be opposites.\nLebesgue integrable functions.\nA measurable function formula_23 is called (Lebesgue) integrable if the Lebesgue integral of its absolute value is finite:\nformula_24\nIf formula_7 is Lebesgue integrable then the Fourier transform, given by Eq.1, is well-defined for all formula_26. Furthermore, formula_27 is bounded, uniformly continuous and (by the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma) vanishing at infinity. Here formula_28 denotes the space of continuous functions on formula_29 that approach 0 as x approaches positive or negative infinity.\nThe space formula_30 is the space of measurable functions for which the norm formula_31 is finite, modulo the equivalence relation of equality almost everywhere. The Fourier transform on formula_30 is one-to-one. However, there is no easy characterization of the image, and thus no easy characterization of the inverse transform. In particular, Eq.2 is no longer valid, as it was stated only under the hypothesis that formula_1 was \"sufficiently nice\" (e.g., formula_1 decays with all derivatives).\nWhile Eq.1 defines the Fourier transform for (complex-valued) functions in formula_30, it is not well-defined for other integrability classes, most importantly the space of square-integrable functions formula_36. For example, the function formula_37 is in formula_38 but not formula_39 and therefore the Lebesgue integral Eq.1 does not exist. However, the Fourier transform on the dense subspace formula_40 admits a unique continuous extension to a unitary operator on formula_36. This extension is important in part because, unlike the case of formula_39, the Fourier transform is an automorphism of the space formula_36.\nIn such cases, the Fourier transform can be obtained explicitly by regularizing the integral, and then passing to a limit. In practice, the integral is often regarded as an improper integral instead of a proper Lebesgue integral, but sometimes for convergence one needs to use weak limit or principal value instead of the (pointwise) limits implicit in an improper integral. and each gives three rigorous ways of extending the Fourier transform to square integrable functions using this procedure. A general principle in working with the formula_38 Fourier transform is that Gaussians are dense in formula_45, and the various features of the Fourier transform, such as its unitarity, are easily inferred for Gaussians. Many of the properties of the Fourier transform can then be proven from two facts about Gaussians:\nA feature of the formula_39 Fourier transform is that it is a homomorphism of Banach algebras from formula_39 equipped with the convolution operation to the Banach algebra of continuous functions under the formula_50 (supremum) norm. The conventions chosen in this article are those of harmonic analysis, and are characterized as the unique conventions such that the Fourier transform is both unitary on \"L\"2 and an algebra homomorphism from \"L\"1 to \"L\"\u221e, without renormalizing the Lebesgue measure.\nBackground.\nHistory.\nIn 1822, Fourier claimed (see ) that any function, whether continuous or discontinuous, can be expanded into a series of sines. That important work was corrected and expanded upon by others to provide the foundation for the various forms of the Fourier transform used since.\nComplex sinusoids.\nIn general, the coefficients formula_51 are complex numbers, which have two equivalent forms (see Euler's formula):\nformula_52\nThe product with formula_53 (Eq.2) has these forms:\nformula_54\nwhich conveys both amplitude and phase of frequency formula_55 Likewise, the intuitive interpretation of Eq.1 is that multiplying formula_1 by formula_57 has the effect of subtracting formula_5 from every frequency component of function formula_59 Only the component that was at frequency formula_5 can produce a non-zero value of the infinite integral, because (at least formally) all the other shifted components are oscillatory and integrate to zero (see ).\nIt is noteworthy how easily the product was simplified using the polar form, and how easily the rectangular form was deduced by an application of Euler's formula.\nNegative frequency.\nEuler's formula introduces the possibility of negative formula_55\u00a0 And Eq.1 is defined formula_62 Only certain complex-valued formula_63 have transforms formula_64 (See Analytic signal. A simple example is formula_65)\u00a0 But negative frequency is necessary to characterize all other complex-valued formula_66 found in signal processing, partial differential equations, radar, nonlinear optics, quantum mechanics, and others.\nFor a real-valued formula_66 Eq.1 has the symmetry property formula_68 (see below). This redundancy enables Eq.2 to distinguish formula_69 from formula_70\u00a0 But it cannot determine the actual sign of formula_71 because formula_72 and formula_73 are indistinguishable on just the real numbers line.\nFourier transform for periodic functions.\nThe Fourier transform of a periodic function cannot be defined using the integral formula directly. In order for integral in Eq.1 to be defined the function must be absolutely integrable. Instead it is common to use Fourier series. It is possible to extend the definition to include periodic functions by viewing them as tempered distributions.\nThis makes it possible to see a connection between the Fourier series and the Fourier transform for periodic functions that have a convergent Fourier series. If formula_1 is a periodic function, with period formula_75, that has a convergent Fourier series, then:\nformula_76\nwhere formula_77 are the Fourier series coefficients of formula_7, and formula_79 is the Dirac delta function. In other words, the Fourier transform is a Dirac comb function whose \"teeth\" are multiplied by the Fourier series coefficients.\nSampling the Fourier transform.\nThe Fourier transform of an integrable function formula_7 can be sampled at regular intervals of arbitrary length formula_81 These samples can be deduced from one cycle of a periodic function formula_82 which has Fourier series coefficients proportional to those samples by the Poisson summation formula:\nformula_83\nThe integrability of formula_7 ensures the periodic summation converges. Therefore, the samples formula_85 can be determined by Fourier series analysis:\nformula_86\nWhen formula_1 has compact support, formula_88 has a finite number of terms within the interval of integration. When formula_1 does not have compact support, numerical evaluation of formula_88 requires an approximation, such as tapering formula_1 or truncating the number of terms.\nUnits.\nThe frequency variable must have inverse units to the units of the original function's domain (typically named formula_13 or formula_12). For example, if formula_13 is measured in seconds, formula_5 should be in cycles per second or hertz. If the scale of time is in units of formula_96 seconds, then another Greek letter formula_97 is typically used instead to represent angular frequency (where formula_98) in units of radians per second. If using formula_12 for units of length, then formula_5 must be in inverse length, e.g., wavenumbers. That is to say, there are two versions of the real line: one which is the range of formula_13 and measured in units of formula_102 and the other which is the range of formula_5 and measured in inverse units to the units of formula_104 These two distinct versions of the real line cannot be equated with each other. Therefore, the Fourier transform goes from one space of functions to a different space of functions: functions which have a different domain of definition.\nIn general, formula_5 must always be taken to be a linear form on the space of its domain, which is to say that the second real line is the dual space of the first real line. See the article on linear algebra for a more formal explanation and for more details. This point of view becomes essential in generalizations of the Fourier transform to general symmetry groups, including the case of Fourier series.\nThat there is no one preferred way (often, one says \"no canonical way\") to compare the two versions of the real line which are involved in the Fourier transform\u2014fixing the units on one line does not force the scale of the units on the other line\u2014is the reason for the plethora of rival conventions on the definition of the Fourier transform. The various definitions resulting from different choices of units differ by various constants.\nIn other conventions, the Fourier transform has i in the exponent instead of \u2212\"i\", and vice versa for the inversion formula. This convention is common in modern physics and is the default for https://, and does not mean that the frequency has become negative, since there is no canonical definition of positivity for frequency of a complex wave. It simply means that formula_51 is the amplitude of the wave\u00a0formula_57\u00a0instead of the wave\u00a0formula_108(the former, with its minus sign, is often seen in the time dependence for sinusoidal plane-wave solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation, or in the time dependence for quantum wave functions). Many of the identities involving the Fourier transform remain valid in those conventions, provided all terms that explicitly involve \"i\" have it replaced by \u2212\"i\". In electrical engineering the letter \"j\" is typically used for the imaginary unit instead of \"i\" because \"i\" is used for current.\nWhen using dimensionless units, the constant factors might not be written in the transform definition. For instance, in probability theory, the characteristic function \u03a6 of the probability density function f of a random variable X of continuous type is defined without a negative sign in the exponential, and since the units of x are ignored, there is no 2\u03c0 either:\nformula_109\nIn probability theory and mathematical statistics, the use of the Fourier\u2014Stieltjes transform is preferred, because many random variables are not of continuous type, and do not possess a density function, and one must treat not functions but distributions, i.e., measures which possess \"atoms\".\nFrom the higher point of view of group characters, which is much more abstract, all these arbitrary choices disappear, as will be explained in the later section of this article, which treats the notion of the Fourier transform of a function on a locally compact Abelian group.\nProperties.\nLet formula_1 and formula_111 represent \"integrable functions\" Lebesgue-measurable on the real line satisfying:\nformula_112\nWe denote the Fourier transforms of these functions as formula_51 and formula_114 respectively.\nBasic properties.\nThe Fourier transform has the following basic properties:\nLinearity.\nformula_115\nTime shifting.\nformula_116\nFrequency shifting.\nformula_117\nTime scaling.\nformula_118\nThe case formula_119 leads to the \"time-reversal property\":\nformula_120\nformula_121\nformula_122\nformula_123\nformula_124\nformula_125\nformula_126\nformula_125\nformula_126\nThe transform of an even-symmetric real-valued function &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; is also an even-symmetric real-valued function (&amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;). The time-shift, &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, creates an imaginary component, &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. (See .)\nSymmetry.\nWhen the real and imaginary parts of a complex function are decomposed into their even and odd parts, there are four components, denoted below by the subscripts RE, RO, IE, and IO. And there is a one-to-one mapping between the four components of a complex time function and the four components of its complex frequency transform:\nformula_129\nFrom this, various relationships are apparent, for example:\nConjugation.\nformula_138\nIn particular, if formula_7 is real, then formula_18 is conjugate symmetric (aka Hermitian function):\nformula_141\nIf formula_7 is purely imaginary, then formula_18 is odd symmetric:\nformula_144\nReal and imaginary parts.\nformula_145\nformula_146\nZero frequency component.\nSubstituting formula_147 in the definition, we obtain:\nformula_148\nThe integral of formula_7 over its domain is known as the average value or DC bias of the function.\nUniform continuity and the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma.\nThe Fourier transform may be defined in some cases for non-integrable functions, but the Fourier transforms of integrable functions have several strong properties.\nThe Fourier transform formula_8 of any integrable function formula_7 is uniformly continuous and\nformula_152\nBy the \"Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma\",\nformula_153\nHowever, formula_8 need not be integrable. For example, the Fourier transform of the rectangular function, which is integrable, is the sinc function, which is not Lebesgue integrable, because its improper integrals behave analogously to the alternating harmonic series, in converging to a sum without being absolutely convergent.\nIt is not generally possible to write the \"inverse transform\" as a Lebesgue integral. However, when both formula_7 and formula_8 are integrable, the inverse equality\nformula_157 holds for almost every x. As a result, the Fourier transform is injective on \"L\"1(R).\nPlancherel theorem and Parseval's theorem.\nLet \"f\"(\"x\") and \"g\"(\"x\") be integrable, and let \"f\u0302\"(\"\u03be\") and \"\u011d\"(\"\u03be\") be their Fourier transforms. If \"f\"(\"x\") and \"g\"(\"x\") are also square-integrable, then the Parseval formula follows:\nformula_158\nwhere the bar denotes complex conjugation.\nThe Plancherel theorem, which follows from the above, states that\nformula_159\nPlancherel's theorem makes it possible to extend the Fourier transform, by a continuity argument, to a unitary operator on \"L\"2(R). On \"L\"1(R) \u2229 \"L\"2(R), this extension agrees with original Fourier transform defined on \"L\"1(R), thus enlarging the domain of the Fourier transform to \"L\"1(R) + \"L\"2(R) (and consequently to for 1 \u2264 \"p\" \u2264 2). Plancherel's theorem has the interpretation in the sciences that the Fourier transform preserves the energy of the original quantity. The terminology of these formulas is not quite standardised. Parseval's theorem was proved only for Fourier series, and was first proved by Lyapunov. But Parseval's formula makes sense for the Fourier transform as well, and so even though in the context of the Fourier transform it was proved by Plancherel, it is still often referred to as Parseval's formula, or Parseval's relation, or even Parseval's theorem.\nSee Pontryagin duality for a general formulation of this concept in the context of locally compact abelian groups.\nConvolution theorem.\nThe Fourier transform translates between convolution and multiplication of functions. If \"f\"(\"x\") and \"g\"(\"x\") are integrable functions with Fourier transforms \"f\u0302\"(\"\u03be\") and \"\u011d\"(\"\u03be\") respectively, then the Fourier transform of the convolution is given by the product of the Fourier transforms \"f\u0302\"(\"\u03be\") and \"\u011d\"(\"\u03be\") (under other conventions for the definition of the Fourier transform a constant factor may appear).\nThis means that if:\nformula_160\nwhere \u2217 denotes the convolution operation, then:\nformula_161\nIn linear time invariant (LTI) system theory, it is common to interpret \"g\"(\"x\") as the impulse response of an LTI system with input \"f\"(\"x\") and output \"h\"(\"x\"), since substituting the unit impulse for \"f\"(\"x\") yields \"h\"(\"x\") = \"g\"(\"x\"). In this case, \"\u011d\"(\"\u03be\") represents the frequency response of the system.\nConversely, if \"f\"(\"x\") can be decomposed as the product of two square integrable functions \"p\"(\"x\") and \"q\"(\"x\"), then the Fourier transform of \"f\"(\"x\") is given by the convolution of the respective Fourier transforms \"p\u0302\"(\"\u03be\") and \"q\u0302\"(\"\u03be\").\nCross-correlation theorem.\nIn an analogous manner, it can be shown that if \"h\"(\"x\") is the cross-correlation of \"f\"(\"x\") and \"g\"(\"x\"):\nformula_162\nthen the Fourier transform of \"h\"(\"x\") is:\nformula_163\nAs a special case, the autocorrelation of function \"f\"(\"x\") is:\nformula_164\nfor which\nformula_165\nDifferentiation.\nSuppose \"f\"(\"x\") is differentiable almost everywhere, and both \"f\" and its derivative \"f\u2032\" are integrable (in formula_30). Then the Fourier transform of the derivative is given by\nformula_167\nMore generally, the Fourier transformation of the nth derivative \"f\"(\"n\") is given by\nformula_168\nAnalogously, formula_169, so formula_170\nBy applying the Fourier transform and using these formulas, some ordinary differential equations can be transformed into algebraic equations, which are much easier to solve. These formulas also give rise to the rule of thumb \"\"f\"(\"x\") is smooth if and only if \"f\u0302\"(\"\u03be\") quickly falls to 0 for .\" By using the analogous rules for the inverse Fourier transform, one can also say \"\"f\"(\"x\") quickly falls to 0 for if and only if \"f\u0302\"(\"\u03be\") is smooth.\"\nEigenfunctions.\nThe Fourier transform is a linear transform which has eigenfunctions obeying formula_171 with formula_172\nA set of eigenfunctions is found by noting that the homogeneous differential equation \nformula_173 \nleads to eigenfunctions formula_174 of the Fourier transform formula_175 as long as the form of the equation remains invariant under Fourier transform. In other words, every solution formula_174 and its Fourier transform formula_177 obey the same equation. Assuming uniqueness of the solutions, every solution formula_174 must therefore be an eigenfunction of the Fourier transform. The form of the equation remains unchanged under Fourier transform if formula_179 can be expanded in a power series in which for all terms the same factor of either one of formula_180 arises from the factors formula_181 introduced by the differentiation rules upon Fourier transforming the homogeneous differential equation because this factor may then be cancelled. The simplest allowable formula_182 leads to the standard normal distribution.\nMore generally, a set of eigenfunctions is also found by noting that the differentiation rules imply that the ordinary differential equation \nformula_183\nwith formula_184 constant and formula_185 being a non-constant even function remains invariant in form when applying the Fourier transform formula_175 to both sides of the equation. The simplest example is provided by formula_187 which is equivalent to considering the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the quantum harmonic oscillator. The corresponding solutions provide an important choice of an orthonormal basis for \"L\"2(R) and are given by the \"physicist's\" Hermite functions. Equivalently one may use\nformula_188\nwhere He\"n\"(\"x\") are the \"probabilist's\" Hermite polynomials, defined as\nformula_189\nUnder this convention for the Fourier transform, we have that\nformula_190\nIn other words, the Hermite functions form a complete orthonormal system of eigenfunctions for the Fourier transform on \"L\"2(R). However, this choice of eigenfunctions is not unique. Because of formula_191 there are only four different eigenvalues of the Fourier transform (the fourth roots of unity \u00b11 and \u00b1i) and any linear combination of eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalue gives another eigenfunction. As a consequence of this, it is possible to decompose \"L\"2(R) as a direct sum of four spaces \"H\"0, \"H\"1, \"H\"2, and \"H\"3 where the Fourier transform acts on He\"k\" simply by multiplication by \"i\"\"k\".\nSince the complete set of Hermite functions \"\u03c8n\" provides a resolution of the identity they diagonalize the Fourier operator, i.e. the Fourier transform can be represented by such a sum of terms weighted by the above eigenvalues, and these sums can be explicitly summed:\nformula_192\nThis approach to define the Fourier transform was first proposed by Norbert Wiener. Among other properties, Hermite functions decrease exponentially fast in both frequency and time domains, and they are thus used to define a generalization of the Fourier transform, namely the fractional Fourier transform used in time\u2013frequency analysis. In physics, this transform was introduced by Edward Condon. This change of basis functions becomes possible because the Fourier transform is a unitary transform when using the right conventions. Consequently, under the proper conditions it may be expected to result from a self-adjoint generator formula_193 via\nformula_194\nThe operator formula_193 is the number operator of the quantum harmonic oscillator written as\nformula_196\nIt can be interpreted as the generator of fractional Fourier transforms for arbitrary values of t, and of the conventional continuous Fourier transform formula_175 for the particular value formula_198 with the Mehler kernel implementing the corresponding active transform. The eigenfunctions of formula_199 are the Hermite functions formula_200 which are therefore also eigenfunctions of formula_201\nUpon extending the Fourier transform to distributions the Dirac comb is also an eigenfunction of the Fourier transform.\nInversion and periodicity.\nUnder suitable conditions on the function formula_7, it can be recovered from its Fourier transform formula_8. Indeed, denoting the Fourier transform operator by formula_175, so formula_205, then for suitable functions, applying the Fourier transform twice simply flips the function: formula_206, which can be interpreted as \"reversing time\". Since reversing time is two-periodic, applying this twice yields formula_207, so the Fourier transform operator is four-periodic, and similarly the inverse Fourier transform can be obtained by applying the Fourier transform three times: formula_208. In particular the Fourier transform is invertible (under suitable conditions).\nMore precisely, defining the \"parity operator\" formula_209 such that formula_210, we have:\nformula_211\nThese equalities of operators require careful definition of the space of functions in question, defining equality of functions (equality at every point? equality almost everywhere?) and defining equality of operators \u2013 that is, defining the topology on the function space and operator space in question. These are not true for all functions, but are true under various conditions, which are the content of the various forms of the Fourier inversion theorem.\nThis fourfold periodicity of the Fourier transform is similar to a rotation of the plane by 90\u00b0, particularly as the two-fold iteration yields a reversal, and in fact this analogy can be made precise. While the Fourier transform can simply be interpreted as switching the time domain and the frequency domain, with the inverse Fourier transform switching them back, more geometrically it can be interpreted as a rotation by 90\u00b0 in the time\u2013frequency domain (considering time as the x-axis and frequency as the y-axis), and the Fourier transform can be generalized to the fractional Fourier transform, which involves rotations by other angles. This can be further generalized to linear canonical transformations, which can be visualized as the action of the special linear group SL2(R) on the time\u2013frequency plane, with the preserved symplectic form corresponding to the uncertainty principle, below. This approach is particularly studied in signal processing, under time\u2013frequency analysis.\nConnection with the Heisenberg group.\nThe Heisenberg group is a certain group of unitary operators on the Hilbert space \"L\"2(R) of square integrable complex valued functions f on the real line, generated by the translations (\"Ty f\")(\"x\") = \"f\" (\"x\" + \"y\") and multiplication by \"e\"\"i\"2\u03c0\"\u03bex\", (\"M\u03be f\")(\"x\") = \"e\"\"i\"2\u03c0\"\u03bex\" \"f\" (\"x\"). These operators do not commute, as their (group) commutator is\nformula_212\nwhich is multiplication by the constant (independent of x) \"e\"\"i\"2\u03c0\"\u03bey\" \u2208 \"U\"(1) (the circle group of unit modulus complex numbers). As an abstract group, the Heisenberg group is the three-dimensional Lie group of triples (\"x\", \"\u03be\", \"z\") \u2208 R2 \u00d7 \"U\"(1), with the group law\nformula_213\nDenote the Heisenberg group by \"H\"1. The above procedure describes not only the group structure, but also a standard unitary representation of \"H\"1 on a Hilbert space, which we denote by \"\u03c1\" : \"H\"1 \u2192 \"B\"(\"L\"2(R)). Define the linear automorphism of R2 by\nformula_214\nso that \"J\"2 = \u2212\"I\". This J can be extended to a unique automorphism of \"H\"1:\nformula_215\nAccording to the Stone\u2013von Neumann theorem, the unitary representations \u03c1 and \"\u03c1\" \u2218 \"j\" are unitarily equivalent, so there is a unique intertwiner \"W\" \u2208 \"U\"(\"L\"2(R)) such that\nformula_216\nThis operator W is the Fourier transform.\nMany of the standard properties of the Fourier transform are immediate consequences of this more general framework. For example, the square of the Fourier transform, \"W\"2, is an intertwiner associated with \"J\"2 = \u2212\"I\", and so we have (\"W\"2\"f\")(\"x\") = \"f\" (\u2212\"x\") is the reflection of the original function f.\nComplex domain.\nThe integral for the Fourier transform\nformula_217\ncan be studied for complex values of its argument \u03be. Depending on the properties of f, this might not converge off the real axis at all, or it might converge to a complex analytic function for all values of \"\u03be\" \n \"\u03c3\" + \"i\u03c4\", or something in between.\nThe Paley\u2013Wiener theorem says that f is smooth (i.e., n-times differentiable for all positive integers n) and compactly supported if and only if \"f\u0302\" (\"\u03c3\" + \"i\u03c4\") is a holomorphic function for which there exists a constant \"a\" &gt; 0 such that for any integer \"n\" \u2265 0,\nformula_218\nfor some constant C. (In this case, f is supported on [\u2212\"a\", \"a\"].) This can be expressed by saying that \"f\u0302\" is an entire function which is rapidly decreasing in \u03c3 (for fixed \u03c4) and of exponential growth in \u03c4 (uniformly in \u03c3).\n(If f is not smooth, but only \"L\"2, the statement still holds provided \"n\" \n 0.) The space of such functions of a complex variable is called the Paley\u2014Wiener space. This theorem has been generalised to semisimple Lie groups.\nIf f is supported on the half-line \"t\" \u2265 0, then f is said to be \"causal\" because the impulse response function of a physically realisable filter must have this property, as no effect can precede its cause. Paley and Wiener showed that then \"f\u0302\" extends to a holomorphic function on the complex lower half-plane \"\u03c4\" &lt; 0 which tends to zero as \u03c4 goes to infinity. The converse is false and it is not known how to characterise the Fourier transform of a causal function.\nLaplace transform.\nThe Fourier transform \"f\u0302\"(\"\u03be\") is related to the Laplace transform \"F\"(\"s\"), which is also used for the solution of differential equations and the analysis of filters.\nIt may happen that a function f for which the Fourier integral does not converge on the real axis at all, nevertheless has a complex Fourier transform defined in some region of the complex plane.\nFor example, if \"f\"(\"t\") is of exponential growth, i.e.,\nformula_219\nfor some constants \"C\", \"a\" \u2265 0, then\nformula_220\nconvergent for all 2\u03c0\"\u03c4\" &lt; \u2212\"a\", is the two-sided Laplace transform of f.\nThe more usual version (\"one-sided\") of the Laplace transform is\nformula_221\nIf f is also causal, and analytical, then: formula_222 Thus, extending the Fourier transform to the complex domain means it includes the Laplace transform as a special case in the case of causal functions\u2014but with the change of variable \"s\" \n \"i\"2\u03c0\"\u03be\".\nFrom another, perhaps more classical viewpoint, the Laplace transform by its form involves an additional exponential regulating term which lets it converge outside of the imaginary line where the Fourier transform is defined. As such it can converge for at most exponentially divergent series and integrals, whereas the original Fourier decomposition cannot, enabling analysis of systems with divergent or critical elements. Two particular examples from linear signal processing are the construction of allpass filter networks from critical comb and mitigating filters via exact pole-zero cancellation on the unit circle. Such designs are common in audio processing, where highly nonlinear phase response is sought for, as in reverb.\nFurthermore, when extended pulselike impulse responses are sought for signal processing work, the easiest way to produce them is to have one circuit which produces a divergent time response, and then to cancel its divergence through a delayed opposite and compensatory response. There, only the delay circuit in-between admits a classical Fourier description, which is critical. Both the circuits to the side are unstable, and do not admit a convergent Fourier decomposition. However, they do admit a Laplace domain description, with identical half-planes of convergence in the complex plane (or in the discrete case, the Z-plane), wherein their effects cancel.\nIn modern mathematics the Laplace transform is conventionally subsumed under the aegis Fourier methods. Both of them are subsumed by the far more general, and more abstract, idea of harmonic analysis.\nInversion.\nStill with formula_223, if formula_18 is complex analytic for \"a\" \u2264 \"\u03c4\" \u2264 \"b\", then\nformula_225\nby Cauchy's integral theorem. Therefore, the Fourier inversion formula can use integration along different lines, parallel to the real axis.\nTheorem: If \"f\"(\"t\") = 0 for \"t\" &lt; 0, and for some constants \"C\", \"a\" &gt; 0, then\nformula_226\nfor any \"\u03c4\" &lt; \u2212.\nThis theorem implies the Mellin inversion formula for the Laplace transformation,\nformula_227\nfor any \"b\" &gt; \"a\", where \"F\"(\"s\") is the Laplace transform of \"f\"(\"t\").\nThe hypotheses can be weakened, as in the results of Carleson and Hunt, to \"f\"(\"t\") \"e\"\u2212\"at\" being \"L\"1, provided that f be of bounded variation in a closed neighborhood of t (cf. Dini test), the value of f at t be taken to be the arithmetic mean of the left and right limits, and that the integrals be taken in the sense of Cauchy principal values.\n\"L\"2 versions of these inversion formulas are also available.\nFourier transform on Euclidean space.\nThe Fourier transform can be defined in any arbitrary number of dimensions n. As with the one-dimensional case, there are many conventions. For an integrable function \"f\"(x), this article takes the definition:\nformula_228\nwhere x and \u03be are n-dimensional vectors, and x \u00b7 \u03be is the dot product of the vectors. Alternatively, \u03be can be viewed as belonging to the dual vector space formula_229, in which case the dot product becomes the contraction of x and \u03be, usually written as .\nAll of the basic properties listed above hold for the n-dimensional Fourier transform, as do Plancherel's and Parseval's theorem. When the function is integrable, the Fourier transform is still uniformly continuous and the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma holds.\nUncertainty principle.\nGenerally speaking, the more concentrated \"f\"(\"x\") is, the more spread out its Fourier transform \"f\u0302\"(\"\u03be\") must be. In particular, the scaling property of the Fourier transform may be seen as saying: if we squeeze a function in x, its Fourier transform stretches out in \u03be. It is not possible to arbitrarily concentrate both a function and its Fourier transform.\nThe trade-off between the compaction of a function and its Fourier transform can be formalized in the form of an uncertainty principle by viewing a function and its Fourier transform as conjugate variables with respect to the symplectic form on the time\u2013frequency domain: from the point of view of the linear canonical transformation, the Fourier transform is rotation by 90\u00b0 in the time\u2013frequency domain, and preserves the symplectic form.\nSuppose \"f\"(\"x\") is an integrable and square-integrable function. Without loss of generality, assume that \"f\"(\"x\") is normalized:\nformula_230\nIt follows from the Plancherel theorem that \"f\u0302\"(\"\u03be\") is also normalized.\nThe spread around \"x\" \n 0 may be measured by the \"dispersion about zero\" defined by\nformula_231\nIn probability terms, this is the second moment of about zero.\nThe uncertainty principle states that, if \"f\"(\"x\") is absolutely continuous and the functions \"x\"\u00b7\"f\"(\"x\") and \"f\"\u2032(\"x\") are square integrable, then\nformula_232\nThe equality is attained only in the case\nformula_233\nwhere \"\u03c3\" &gt; 0 is arbitrary and \"C\"1 = so that f is \"L\"2-normalized. In other words, where f is a (normalized) Gaussian function with variance \"\u03c3\"2/2\u03c0, centered at zero, and its Fourier transform is a Gaussian function with variance \"\u03c3\"\u22122/2\u03c0. Gaussian functions are examples of Schwartz functions (see the discussion on tempered distributions below). \nIn fact, this inequality implies that:\nformula_234\nIn quantum mechanics, the momentum and position wave functions are Fourier transform pairs, up to a factor of the Planck constant. With this constant properly taken into account, the inequality above becomes the statement of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\nA stronger uncertainty principle is the Hirschman uncertainty principle, which is expressed as:\nformula_235\nwhere \"H\"(\"p\") is the differential entropy of the probability density function \"p\"(\"x\"):\nformula_236\nwhere the logarithms may be in any base that is consistent. The equality is attained for a Gaussian, as in the previous case.\nSine and cosine transforms.\nFourier's original formulation of the transform did not use complex numbers, but rather sines and cosines. Statisticians and others still use this form. An absolutely integrable function f for which Fourier inversion holds can be expanded in terms of genuine frequencies (avoiding negative frequencies, which are sometimes considered hard to interpret physically) \u03bb by\nformula_237\nThis is called an expansion as a trigonometric integral, or a Fourier integral expansion. The coefficient functions a and b can be found by using variants of the Fourier cosine transform and the Fourier sine transform (the normalisations are, again, not standardised):\nformula_238\nand\nformula_239\nOlder literature refers to the two transform functions, the Fourier cosine transform, a, and the Fourier sine transform, b.\nThe function f can be recovered from the sine and cosine transform using\nformula_240\ntogether with trigonometric identities. This is referred to as Fourier's integral formula.\nSpherical harmonics.\nLet the set of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree k on R\"n\" be denoted by A\"k\". The set A\"k\" consists of the solid spherical harmonics of degree k. The solid spherical harmonics play a similar role in higher dimensions to the Hermite polynomials in dimension one. Specifically, if \"f\"(\"x\") = \"e\"\u2212\u03c0|\"x\"|2\"P\"(\"x\") for some \"P\"(\"x\") in A\"k\", then \"f\u0302\"(\"\u03be\") = \"i\"\u2212\"k\" \"f\"(\"\u03be\"). Let the set H\"k\" be the closure in \"L\"2(R\"n\") of linear combinations of functions of the form \"f\"(|\"x\"|)\"P\"(\"x\") where \"P\"(\"x\") is in A\"k\". The space \"L\"2(R\"n\") is then a direct sum of the spaces H\"k\" and the Fourier transform maps each space H\"k\" to itself and is possible to characterize the action of the Fourier transform on each space H\"k\".\nLet \"f\"(\"x\") = \"f\"0(|\"x\"|)\"P\"(\"x\") (with \"P\"(\"x\") in A\"k\"), then\nformula_241\nwhere\nformula_242\nHere \"J\"(\"n\" + 2\"k\" \u2212 2)/2 denotes the Bessel function of the first kind with order . When \"k\" \n 0 this gives a useful formula for the Fourier transform of a radial function. This is essentially the Hankel transform. Moreover, there is a simple recursion relating the cases \"n\" + 2 and n allowing to compute, e.g., the three-dimensional Fourier transform of a radial function from the one-dimensional one.\nRestriction problems.\nIn higher dimensions it becomes interesting to study \"restriction problems\" for the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of an integrable function is continuous and the restriction of this function to any set is defined. But for a square-integrable function the Fourier transform could be a general \"class\" of square integrable functions. As such, the restriction of the Fourier transform of an \"L\"2(R\"n\") function cannot be defined on sets of measure 0. It is still an active area of study to understand restriction problems in \"L\"\"p\" for 1 &lt; \"p\" &lt; 2. It is possible in some cases to define the restriction of a Fourier transform to a set S, provided S has non-zero curvature. The case when S is the unit sphere in R\"n\" is of particular interest. In this case the Tomas\u2013Stein restriction theorem states that the restriction of the Fourier transform to the unit sphere in R\"n\" is a bounded operator on \"L\"\"p\" provided 1 \u2264 \"p\" \u2264.\nOne notable difference between the Fourier transform in 1 dimension versus higher dimensions concerns the partial sum operator. Consider an increasing collection of measurable sets \"E\"\"R\" indexed by \"R\" \u2208 (0,\u221e): such as balls of radius R centered at the origin, or cubes of side 2\"R\". For a given integrable function f, consider the function fR defined by:\nformula_243\nSuppose in addition that \"f\" \u2208 \"L\"\"p\"(R\"n\"). For \"n\" \n 1 and 1 &lt; \"p\" &lt; \u221e, if one takes \"ER\" \n (\u2212\"R\", \"R\"), then fR converges to f in \"L\"\"p\" as R tends to infinity, by the boundedness of the Hilbert transform. Naively one may hope the same holds true for \"n\" &gt; 1. In the case that ER is taken to be a cube with side length R, then convergence still holds. Another natural candidate is the Euclidean ball \"E\"\"R\" \n {\"\u03be\" : |\"\u03be\"| &lt; \"R\"}. In order for this partial sum operator to converge, it is necessary that the multiplier for the unit ball be bounded in \"L\"\"p\"(R\"n\"). For \"n\" \u2265 2 it is a celebrated theorem of Charles Fefferman that the multiplier for the unit ball is never bounded unless \"p\" \n 2. In fact, when \"p\" \u2260 2, this shows that not only may fR fail to converge to f in \"L\"\"p\", but for some functions \"f\" \u2208 \"L\"\"p\"(R\"n\"), fR is not even an element of \"L\"\"p\".\nFourier transform on function spaces.\nThe definition of the Fourier transform naturally extends from formula_30 to formula_245. That is, if formula_246 then the Fourier transform \nformula_247 is given by formula_248\nThis operator is bounded as\nformula_249\nwhich shows that its operator norm is bounded by 1. The Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma shows that if formula_250 then its Fourier transform actually belongs to the space of continuous functions which vanish at infinity, i.e., formula_251. Furthermore, the image of formula_39 under formula_175 is a strict subset of formula_254.\nSimilarly to the case of one variable, the Fourier transform can be defined on formula_255. The Fourier transform in formula_255 is no longer given by an ordinary Lebesgue integral, although it can be computed by an improper integral, i.e.,\nformula_257\nFormulas for general \"n\"-dimensional functions.\n&lt;/math&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52248", "revid": "37820843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52248", "title": "Gujarati script", "text": "Indian script\nThe Gujarati script (, transliterated: ) is an abugida for the Gujarati language, Kutchi language, and various other languages. It is one of the official scripts of the Indian Republic. It is a variant of the Devanagari script differentiated by the loss of the \"Shirorekh\u0101\", the characteristic horizontal line running above the letters and by a number of modifications to some characters.\nGujarati numerical digits are also different from their Devanagari counterparts.\nOrigin.\nThe Gujarati script () was adapted from the Nagari script to write the Gujarati language. The Gujarati language and script developed in three distinct phases \u2014 10th to 15th century, 15th to 17th century and 17th to 19th century. The first phase is marked by use of Prakrit, Apabramsa and its variants such as Paisaci, Shauraseni, Magadhi and Maharashtri. In second phase, Old Gujarati script was in wide use. The earliest known document in the Old Gujarati script is a handwritten manuscript \"Adi Parva\" dating from 1591 to 1592, and the script first appeared in print in a 1797 advertisement. The third phase is the use of script developed for ease and fast writing. The use of \"shirorekh\u0101\" (the topline as in Devanagari) was abandoned. Until the 19th century it was used mainly for writing letters and keeping accounts, while the Devanagari script was used for literature and academic writings. It is also known as the \"\u015bar\u0101ph\u012b\" (banker's), \"v\u0101\u1e47i\u0101\u015b\u0101\u012b\" (merchant's) or \"mah\u0101jan\u012b\" (trader's) script. This script became the basis of the modern script. Later the same script was adopted by writers of manuscripts. Jain community also promoted its use for copying religious texts by hired writers.\nOverview.\nThe Gujarati writing system is an abugida, in which each base consonantal character possesses an inherent vowel, that vowel being \"a\" [\u0259]. For postconsonantal vowels other than \"a\", the vowel is applied with diacritics, while for non-postconsonantal vowels (initial and post-vocalic positions), there are full-formed characters. With \"a\" being the most frequent vowel, this is a convenient system in the sense that it cuts down on the width of writing.\nFollowing out of the aforementioned property, consonants lacking a proceeding vowel may condense into the proceeding consonant, forming \"compound\" or \"conjunct\" letters. The formation of these conjuncts follows a system of rules depending on the consonants involved.\nIn accordance with all the other Indic scripts, Gujarati is written from left to right, and is not case-sensitive.\nThe Gujarati script is basically phonemic, with a few exceptions. First out of these is the written representation of non-pronounced \"a\"'s, which are of three types.\nSecondly and most importantly, being of Sanskrit-based Devanagari, Gujarati's script retains notations for the obsolete (short \"i, u\" vs. long \"\u012b, \u016b\"; \"r\u0325\", \"ru\"; \"\u015b\", \"\u1e63\"), and lacks notations for innovations ( vs. ; vs. ; clear vs. murmured vowels).\nContemporary Gujarati uses English punctuation, such as the question mark, exclamation mark, comma, and full stop. Apostrophes are used for the rarely written clitic. Quotation marks are not as often used for direct quotes. The full stop replaced the traditional vertical bar, and the colon, mostly obsolete in its Sanskritic capacity (see below), follows the European usage.\nUse for Avestan.\nThe Zoroastrians of India, who represent one of the largest surviving Zoroastrian communities worldwide, would transcribe Avestan in Nagri script-based scripts as well as the Avestan alphabet. This is a relatively recent development first seen in the c.\u200912th century texts of Neryosang Dhaval and other Parsi Sanskritist theologians of that era, and which are roughly contemporary with the oldest surviving manuscripts in Avestan script. Today, Avestan is most commonly typeset in Gujarati script (Gujarati being the traditional language of the Indian Zoroastrians). Some Avestan letters with no corresponding symbol are synthesized with additional diacritical marks, for example, the /z/ in \"zara\u03b8u\u0161tra\" is written with /j/ + dot below.\nInfluence in Southeast Asia.\nMiller (2010) presented a theory that the indigenous scripts of Sumatra (Indonesia), Sulawesi (Indonesia) and the Philippines are descended from an early form of the Gujarati script. Historical records show that Gujaratis played a major role in the archipelago, where they were manufacturers and played a key role in introducing Islam. Tom\u00e9 Pires reported a presence of a thousand Gujaratis in Malacca (Malaysia) prior to 1512.\nGujarati letters, diacritics, and digits.\nVowels.\nVowels (\"svara\"), in their conventional order, are historically grouped into \"short\" (\"hrasva\") and \"long\" (\"d\u012brgha\") classes, based on the \"light\" (\"laghu\") and \"heavy\" (\"guru\") syllables they create in traditional verse. The historical long vowels \"\u012b\" and \"\u016b\" are no longer distinctively long in pronunciation. Only in verse do syllables containing them assume the values required by meter.\nFinally, a practice of using inverted \"m\u0101tra\"s to represent English and 's has gained ground.\n\u0ab0 \"r\", \u0a9c \"j\" and \u0ab9 \"h\" form the irregular forms of \u0ab0\u0ac2 \"r\u016b\", \u0ab0\u0ac1 \"ru\", \u0a9c\u0ac0 \"j\u012b\" and \u0ab9\u0ac3 \"h\u1e5b\".\nConsonants.\nConsonants (\"vya\u00f1jana\") are grouped in accordance with the traditional, linguistically based Sanskrit scheme of arrangement, which considers the usage and position of the tongue during their pronunciation. In sequence, these categories are: velar, palatal, retroflex, dental, labial, sonorant and fricative. Among the first five groups, which contain the stops, the ordering starts with the unaspirated voiceless, then goes on through aspirated voiceless, unaspirated voiced, and aspirated voiced, ending with the nasal stops. They all have a Devanagari counterpart.\nPlosives &amp; Nasals (left to right, top to bottom) \u2192 Sonorants &amp; Sibilants (top to bottom, left to right) \u2192 Bottom box (top to bottom)\nConjuncts.\nAs mentioned, successive consonants lacking a vowel in between them may physically join as a 'conjunct'. The government of these clusters ranges from widely to narrowly applicable rules, with special exceptions within. While standardized for the most part, there are certain variations in clustering, of which the Unicode used on this page is just one scheme. The rules:\nThe role and nature of Sanskrit must be taken into consideration to understand the occurrence of consonant clusters. The orthography of written Sanskrit was completely phonetic, and had a tradition of not separating words by spaces. Morphologically it was highly synthetic, and it had a great capacity to form large compound words. Thus clustering was highly frequent, and it is Sanskrit loanwords to the Gujarati language that are the grounds of most clusters. Gujarati, on the other hand, is more analytic, has phonetically smaller, simpler words, and has a script whose orthography is slightly imperfect (\"a\"-elision) and separates words by spaces. Thus evolved Gujarati words are less a cause for clusters. The same can be said of Gujarati's other longstanding source of words, Persian, which also provides phonetically smaller and simpler words.\nAn example attesting to this general theme is that of the series of \"d-\" clusters. These are essentially Sanskrit clusters, using the original Devanagari forms. There are no cluster forms for formations such as \"dta\", \"dka\", etc. because such formations weren't permitted in Sanskrit phonology anyway. They are permitted under Gujarati phonology, but are written unclustered (\u0aaa\u0aa6\u0aa4 \"padata\" \"position\", \u0a95\u0ac2\u0aa6\u0a95\u0acb \"k\u016bdko\" \"leap\"), with patterns such as \"a\"-elision at work instead.\nRomanization.\nGujarati is romanized throughout Wikipedia in \"standard orientalist\" transcription as outlined in . Being \"primarily a system of transliteration from the Indian scripts, [and] based in turn upon Sanskrit\" (cf. IAST), these are its salient features: subscript dots for retroflex consonants; macrons for etymologically, contrastively long vowels; \"h\" denoting aspirated stops. Tildes denote nasalized vowels and underlining denotes murmured vowels.\nVowels and consonants are outlined in the tables below. Hovering the mouse cursor over them will reveal the appropriate IPA symbol. Finally, there are three Wikipedia-specific additions: \"f\" is used interchangeably with \"ph\", representing the widespread realization of as ; \"\u00e2\" and \"\u00f4\" for novel characters \u0a8d and \u0a91 ; \"\u01ce\" for 's where elision is uncertain. See Gujarati phonology for further clarification.\nUnicode.\nGujarati script was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.\nThe Unicode block for Gujarati is U+0A80\u2013U+0AFF:\nFurther details regarding how to use Unicode for creating Gujarati script can be found on Wikibooks: .\nISCII.\nThe Indian Script Code for Information Interchange (ISCII) code-page identifier for Gujarati script is 57010.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Darmstadt has around 160,000 inhabitants, making it the fourth largest city in the state of Hesse after Frankfurt am Main, Wiesbaden, and Kassel.\nDarmstadt holds the official title \"City of Science\" () as it is a major centre of scientific institutions, universities, and high-technology companies. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the European Space Agency's European Space Operations Centre (ESA ESOC) are located in Darmstadt, as well as GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research, where several chemical elements such as darmstadtium, roentgenium, and copernicium were discovered. The existence of several elements was also confirmed at the GSI Centre. The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is an international accelerator facility under construction. Darmstadt is also the seat of the world's oldest pharmaceutical company, Merck, which is the city's largest employer.\nThe Mathildenh\u00f6he, including the Darmstadt artists' colony, a major centre of the Jugendstil artistic movement, referring both to the group of artists active in the city in the late 19th and early 20th century, as well as the buildings which they designed, together with the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt, were recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2021.\nDarmstadt was formerly the capital of a sovereign state, the Grand Duchy of Hesse and its successor, the People's State of Hesse, a federal state of Germany. As the capital of an increasingly prosperous duchy, the city gained some international prominence and remains one of the wealthiest cities in Europe. In the 20th century, industry (especially chemicals), as well as large science and electronics (and later, information technology) sectors became increasingly important, and are still a major part of the city's economy. It is also home to the football club SV Darmstadt 98. Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse), the wife of Nicholas II of Russia, as well as Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse), the wife of Alexander II of Russia, who were related, were born in this city.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe name Darmstadt first appears towards the end of the 11th century, then as \"Darmundestat\".\nDarmstadt was chartered as a city by the Holy Roman Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian in 1330, at which time it belonged to the counts of Katzenelnbogen. The city, then called \"Darmstait\", became a secondary residence for the counts, with a small castle established at the site of the current, much larger edifice.\nWhen the house of Katzenelnbogen became extinct in 1479, the city was passed to the Landgraviate of Hesse, and was seat of the ruling landgraves (1567\u20131806) and thereafter (to 1918) of the grand dukes of Hesse.\nIndustrial age.\nThe city's population grew during the 19th century, from a little over 10,000, to 72,000 inhabitants. A polytechnical school, which later became a Technical University now known as TU Darmstadt, was established in 1877.\nIn the early 20th century, Darmstadt was an important centre for the art movement of Jugendstil, the German variant of Art Nouveau. Also during this period, in 1912 the chemist Anton Kollisch, working for the pharmaceutical company Merck, first synthesised the chemical MDMA (ecstasy) in Darmstadt. Darmstadt's municipal area was extended in 1937 to include the neighbouring localities of Arheilgen and Eberstadt, and in 1938 the city was separated administratively from the surrounding district (\"Kreis\").\nNazi Germany.\nDarmstadt was the first city in Germany to force Jewish shops to close in early 1933, shortly after the Nazis took power in Germany. The shops were only closed for one day, for \"endangering communal order and tranquility\". In 1942, over 3,000 Jews from Darmstadt were first forced into a collection camp located in the Liebigschule, and later deported to concentration camps where most eventually died. In 1944, the city was also the location of a subcamp of the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp.\nSeveral prominent members of the German resistance movement against the Nazis were citizens of Darmstadt, including Wilhelm Leuschner and Theodor Haubach, both executed for their opposition to Hitler's regime.\nDarmstadt was first bombed on 30 July 1940, and 34 other air raids would follow before the war's end. The old city centre was largely destroyed in a British bombing raid on 11/12 September 1944. This attack was an example of \"area bombing\" using high explosive and incendiary bombs, which combined in that attack to create a firestorm, a self-sustaining combustion process in which winds generated by the fire ensure it continues to burn until everything possible has been consumed. During this attack, an estimated 11,000 to 12,500 of the inhabitants were killed, and 66,000 to 70,000 were left homeless. Over three-quarters of Darmstadt's inner city was destroyed. Post-war rebuilding was done in a relatively plain architectural style, although a number of the historic buildings were rebuilt to their original appearance following the city's capture on 25 March 1945 by the American 4th Armored Division. Today around 30% of Darmstadt consists of buildings from before World War II.\nPost\u2013World War II.\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Darmstadt became home to many technology companies and research institutes, and has been promoting itself as a \"city of science\" since 1997. It is well known as a high-tech centre in the vicinity of Frankfurt Airport, with important activities in spacecraft operations (the European Space Agency's European Space Operations Centre, European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites), chemistry, pharmacy, information technology, biotechnology, telecommunications (substantial Deutsche Telekom presence) and mechatronics. In 2000, its region also scored Rank 3 amongst 97 German regions in the \"WirtschaftsWoche\" test ranking Germany's high-tech regions.\nThe roots of Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences goes back to 1876 along with Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt (the first electrical engineering chair and inventions fame), when both these Universities were an integrated entities, a need for a separate industry based research educational institution was felt in the early 1930s, finally University of Applied sciences emerged as a separate industry based research educational institution in 1971 and is the largest University of Applied Sciences in Hesse (German: Hessen) with about 16,500 students.\nThe TU Darmstadt is one of the important technical institutes in Germany and is well known for its research and teaching in the Electrical, Mechanical and Civil Engineering disciplines. Together with other tertiary institutions, the TU is responsible for the large student population of the city, which stood at 33,547 in 2004.\nBoroughs.\nDarmstadt has nine official 'Stadtteile' (boroughs). These are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPopulation development.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPolitics.\nMayor.\nThe current mayor of Darmstadt is Hanno Benz of SPD, who was elected in 2023.\nThe following is a list of mayors since 1945:\nCity council.\nThe Darmstadt city council (\"Stadtverordnetenversammlung\") governs the city alongside the Mayor. The most recent city council election was held on 14 March 2021, and the results were as follows:\nTransport.\nRoads.\nDarmstadt is connected to a number of major roads, including two Autobahnen (Bundesautobahn 5 and Bundesautobahn 67). The main road passing west\u2013east is the Bundesstra\u00dfe 26, the Bundesstra\u00dfe 3 runs north\u2013south. The rural areas east of the city in the Odenwald are accessed by several secondary roads.\nNational rail links.\nDarmstadt is connected to the rest of Germany and Europe through its main railway station, Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof, which is located in the western part of the city centre. The station is part of the Intercity-Express network and also served by other long-distance trains. It is a busy station with 12 platforms and serves as a transportation hub for the southern Hesse/Odenwald region.\nRegional rail links.\nDarmstadt Hauptbahnhof is the terminus of of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn, which connects the city to Frankfurt. Within Darmstadt the S6 also stops at stations in Darmstadt-Arheilgen and Darmstadt-Wixhausen. Regional trains also connect six secondary railway stations within Darmstadt, and stations in the surrounding region, with Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof.\nPublic transport in Darmstadt.\nThe extensive public transport system of Darmstadt is integrated in the RMV (the transportation authority of the Rhein-Main Metropolitan Area). The backbone of public transport in Darmstadt is the tram system with 10 lines. Local bus lines also serve all parts of the city and the city is served by regional bus lines.\nAirports.\nThe historically important local airfield August Euler Airfield is closed to aviation at large, being reserved for the use of the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt.\nDarmstadt can be easily accessed from around the world via Frankfurt Airport (\"Flughafen Frankfurt am Main\") which is located north of central Darmstadt and connected to it via Autobahn 5, S-Bahn, several bus lines and a direct express bus-link (\"Airliner\"). The airport ranks among the world's busiest airports by passenger traffic and is the second-busiest airport by cargo traffic in Europe. The airport also serves as the main hub for German flag carrier Lufthansa.\nFrankfurt Egelsbach Airport (\"Flugplatz Frankfurt-Egelsbach\") is a busy general aviation airport located 5\u00a0km north of Darmstadt, near the town of Egelsbach.\nDespite the name, Frankfurt Hahn Airport (\"Flughafen Frankfurt-Hahn\") is located far outside the Frankfurt Metro Area, approximately to the west in Lautzenhausen (Rhineland-Palatinate). Hahn Airport is a major base for low-cost carrier Ryanair. This airport can only be reached by car or bus.\nNational coach services.\nDarmstadt is served by several national and European bus links which connect Darmstadt with other German and European cities.\nParks, architecture, and attractions.\nCastles and historical buildings.\nDarmstadt was the capital of an independent country (the Grand Duchy of Hesse) until 1871 and the capital of the German state of Hesse until 1945. It is due to its past as a capital city that it has many architectural testimonies of this period. Many of its major architectural landmarks were created by Georg Moller who was appointed the court master builder of the Grand Duchy of Hesse.\nThe Residential Palace Darmstadt () is located in the city centre. It was the residence of the counts of Hesse-Darmstadt, later as Grand Dukes of Hesse by the grace of Napoleon. The rulers of Hesse also owned Jagdschloss Kranichstein, a hunting lodge in Kranichstein which is a nowadays used as a five star hotel. The most famous castle in the Darmstadt region is Frankenstein Castle due to claims that the real castle may have had an influence on Mary Shelley's decision to choose the name Frankenstein for her monster-creating scientist. This castle dates back to the 13th century, but it was acquired by the counts of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1662.\nRussian Chapel.\nThe last ruling Grand Duke of Hesse, Ernst Ludwig was a grandson of Queen Victoria and brother to Empress Alexandra of Russia. The architecture of Darmstadt has been influenced by British and Russian imperial architecture with many examples still existing, such as the Luisenplatz with its grand-ducal column, the old Hessian State Theatre and the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt. The Russian Chapel is a Russian orthodox church which is still in use. It was built and used as a private chapel by the last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II, whose wife Alexandra was born in Darmstadt. Although Russian orthodox churches also exist in other cities outside Russia, the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt was the only official Russian church used by the Tsar outside the Russian Empire. It is said that the chapel was built on Russian soil that was brought to Darmstadt exclusively for the purpose of building the Tsar's private chapel on it. by Leon Benois. The Russian church, St. Mary Magdalene Chapel, is named in honor of the patron saint of Tsar Nicholas' mother and was built of Russian stone on Russian soil brought to Darmstadt by train. It was used by the Russian imperial family and court during regular visits to the Tsarina's brother and family in Darmstadt.\nModern architecture.\nDarmstadt has a rich tradition in modern architecture. After 1945 several \"Meisterbauten\" (\"Masterful Architectonic Creations\") were built that set standards for modern architecture. These buildings still exist and are used for various public and private purposes. In the late 1990s the Waldspirale ('Forest Spiral') was built, a residential complex by Austrian Friedensreich Hundertwasser. As an almost surreal building, it is internationally famous for its almost absolute rejection of rectangular forms, down to every window having a different shape, the style being a trademark of Hundertwasser's work. Hundertwasser died before the Waldspirale was finished.\nArt Nouveau.\nDarmstadt was a centre of the Art Nouveau movement. Surviving examples of the Jugendstil period include the Rosenh\u00f6he, a landscaped English-style rose garden from the 19th century, recently renovated and replanted, the UNESCO World Heritage Site Mathildenh\u00f6he, with the \"Hochzeitsturm\" ('Wedding tower', also commonly known as the 'Five-Finger-Tower') by Joseph Maria Olbrich, the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt and large exhibition halls as well as many private villas built by Jugendstil architects who had settled in Darmstadt. German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, Jugendstil. The name is taken from the artistic journal, Die Jugend, which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by Georg Hirth (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: Jugendstil (\"young style\"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts, especially the forms of organic typography and graphic design found in and influenced by German magazines like Jugend, Pan, and Simplicissimus, it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the Netherlands, the Baltic states, and Nordic countries. The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were Munich and Darmstadt.\nSquares.\nThe \"Luisenplatz\", the central square of the city, forms the centre of the city and is the main public transport hub. In 1844 the \"Ludwigs\u00e4ule\" (called \"Langer Lui\", meaning \"Long Ludwig\"), a 33-metre (108\u00a0ft) column commemorating Ludwig I, first Grand Duke of Hesse, was placed in the middle of the square. While the column still stands, the square is today surrounded by mostly modern buildings. Other important squares are the \"Marktplatz\" (see image) near the old city hall and the \"Sabaisplatz\" at the \"Mathildenh\u00f6he\".\nParks.\nThe city has a high density of parks. Among the most important parks are the English style \"Herrngarten\" in central Darmstadt. In former times it was part of the Royal Gardens used exclusively by the dukes of Darmstadt. Today it is a public park, heavily used in every season of the year. Other important parks are the French style parks \"Prinz-Georgs-Garten\" and Orangerie, the modern style \"B\u00fcrgerpark\" (\"People's Park\") in northern Darmstadt and the mystical Rosenh\u00f6he Park (\"Rose Heights\"), which also serves as the cemetery for the grand dukes and their immediate family, with two impressive mausoleum buildings (the Old Mausoleum and New Mausoleum) standing within it. The \"Botanischer Garten\" in eastern Darmstadt is a botanical garden maintained by the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt with a fine collection of rare plants and trees.\nChurches.\nThe Protestant Stadtkirche Darmstadt built in 1369, is in the pedestrian zone of the downtown city center, next to the historic Hotel Bockshaut. The church has gothic elements along with renaissance and baroque, it houses the royal crypt. Hotel Bockshaut was built in 1580 for a church presbytery. The most important Catholic Church is \"St. Ludwig\" in central Darmstadt.\nFestivals.\nEvery year on the first weekend of July the Heinerfest festival is held in the streets surrounding the old ducal palace. It is a traditional German festival with music acts, beer halls, amusement rides and booths selling trinkets and food. The Schlossgrabenfest, better known as the Stage Groove Festival, is live music-oriented and is held every year in May. These two festivals attract 700,000 and 400,000 visitors respectively.\nCulture.\nDarmstadt has a rich cultural heritage. The Staatstheater Darmstadt dates back to the year 1711. The present building has been in use since 1972 and has three halls which can be used independently. The \"Grand Hall\" (Gro\u00dfes Haus) provides seats for 956 people and serves as Darmstadt's opera house. The \"Small Hall\" (Kleines Haus) is mostly used for plays and dance and has 482 seats. A separate small hall (Kammerspiele), with 120 seats, is used for chamber plays.\nAmong the museums in Darmstadt the most important are the Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hessian State Museum), the Porcelain Museum (exhibition of the ducal porcelain), the Schlossmuseum (Palace Museum exhibiting the ducal residence and possessions), the Kunsthalle Darmstadt (exhibitions of modern art), the exhibition centre Mathildenh\u00f6he, and the Museum K\u00fcnstlerkolonie (Art Nouveau museum).\nThe Darmstadt Palace Museum collection showcases regional and royal history from the 16th until the early 20th Century. The Palace Museum consists of 16 showrooms.\nThe Jazz-Institut Darmstadt is Germany's largest publicly accessible jazz archive.\nThe Internationales Musikinstitut Darmstadt, harboring one of the world's largest collections of post-war sheet music, also hosts the biennial Internationale Ferienkurse f\u00fcr Neue Musik, a summer school in contemporary classical music founded by Wolfgang Steinecke. A large number of avant-garde composers have attended and given lectures there, including Olivier Messiaen, Luciano Berio, Milton Babbitt, Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono, John Cage, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Mauricio Kagel, and Helmut Lachenmann.\nThe Deutsche Akademie f\u00fcr Sprache und Dichtung provides writers and scholars with a place to research the German language. The academy's annual Georg B\u00fcchner Prize, named in memory of Georg B\u00fcchner, is considered the most prestigious literary award for writers of German language.\nGeography.\nDarmstadt is located in the Upper Rhine Plain (German: Oberrheinische Tiefebene), a major rift, about 350\u00a0km (217\u00a0mi) long and on average 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) wide, between the cities of Frankfurt in the north and Mannheim in the south. Darmstadt's southeastern boroughs are located in the spurs of the Odenwald, a low mountain range in Southern Hesse between the Main and Neckar rivers.\nClimate.\nSouthern Hesse is well known for its mild climate which allows winegrowing on a large scale in the region south of Darmstadt. The weather is often volatile with the summers being warm and humid with frequent thunderstorms, the winters mostly relatively mild with frequent periods of high fog. Snowfall is most likely in January and February, but mild winters without considerable snowfall can occur.\nThe Darmstadt weather station has recorded the following extreme values:\nNote.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEducation.\nSchools.\nThe City of Darmstadt offers students a broad variety of public primary, secondary and tertiary schools. Besides them private schools exist, e.g. the catholic secondary school \"Edith-Stein-Schule\", the Adventists' \"Schulzentrum Marienh\u00f6he\", an anthroposophic \"Waldorf School\", a \"Comenius\" \"School\" and other faith based private schools.\nUniversities.\nTU Darmstadt.\nThe Technical University of Darmstadt (), commonly referred to as TU Darmstadt, is a prestigious research university in Germany. It was founded in 1877 and received the right to award doctorates in 1899. In 1882 it was the first university in the world to set up a chair in electrical engineering, in 1883 the first faculty for electrical engineering was founded there. The university is organized in 13 departments and 5 fields of study, which all together offer about 100 courses of studies. The fields of study offer interdisciplinary degree courses in which students take lectures in multiple departments. The university, as its title suggests, offers degree courses in the fields of electrical, mechanical and civil engineering, architecture, computer science, mathematics and the natural sciences. It also offers courses in economics, law, history, politics, sociology, psychology, sport science and linguistics. It also offers degree courses for teaching positions at German vocational schools and Gymnasiums.\nHochschule Darmstadt.\nThe Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences () has the highest number of industrial linkage programs, compared to the rest of the universities of applied sciences. The roots of University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt dates back to 1876. However, it has not emerged as a separate institution before 1971. As of 2017 it was the largest University of Applied Sciences in the State of Hesse, with about 16,000 students. It offers courses in architecture, chemical engineering, materials science, civil engineering, computer science, design, economics, electrical engineering and information technology, mathematics and science, mechanical engineering, media (including information science and engineering), plastics engineering, social and cultural studies, and several social sciences.\nEHD Darmstadt.\nThe Protestant University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt (EHD) is an officially recognised and Church-sponsored University. The sponsors are the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau, the Protestant Church of Kurhesse-Waldeck and the social welfare organisation of both Hessian Protestant Churches, the Diakonie Hesse. The EHD has approximately 1,700 students, 40 professors and 10 scientific employees and about 100 visiting lecturers every semester.\nSport.\nFootball.\nThe city's main professional club is the football club SV Darmstadt 98, who play at the Merck-Stadion am B\u00f6llenfalltor. Other, amateur football clubs are 1. FCA Darmstadt and Rot-Wei\u00df Darmstadt.\nIce hockey.\nThe Darmstadt Dukes (Eissportclub Darmstadt Dukes) is an ice hockey club. Their mens`s team is playing in the Hessenliga.\nAmerican football.\nThe city is home to the Darmstadt Diamonds an american football team.\nInstitutions.\nTechnology.\nDarmstadt is home to many research institutions such as the Fraunhofer Society (Fraunhofer IGD, Fraunhofer LBF, Fraunhofer SIT) and the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung (GSI, \"Society for heavy ion Research\"), which operates a particle accelerator in northern Darmstadt. The GSI, amongst other elements, discovered the chemical element darmstadtium (atomic number: 110), named after the city in 2003. This makes Darmstadt one of several cities with elements named after them. Various other elements, including meitnerium (atomic number: 109) (1982), hassium (atomic number: 108) (1984), roentgenium (atomic number: 111) (1994) and copernicium (atomic number: 112) (1996) were also synthesized in the Darmstadt facility.\nThe European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) of the European Space Agency is located in Darmstadt. From here, various deep-space exploration spacecraft and Earth-orbiting satellites are operated for the purposes of scientific research, and technology development and demonstration.\nEUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, operates the principal European meteorological satellites from its headquarters, including the first and second generations of Meteosat geostationary satellites, and the polar-orbiting Metop series.\nDarmstadt is a centre for the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, with Merck, R\u00f6hm and Schenck RoTec (part of The D\u00fcrr Group) having their main plants and centres here.\nDarmstadt is also a centre for the IT and telecommunications industry, with companies like Software AG, T-Systems (laboratories in Darmstadt) and Deutsche Telekom (laboratories in Darmstadt).\nATHENE, formerly Center for Research in Security and Privacy (CRISP), is the national research center for IT security and privacy in Germany and the largest research center for IT security in Europe. The research center is located in Darmstadt and deals with key issues of IT security in the digitization of government, business and society.\nThe German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence has a laboratory in Darmstadt.\nThe Hessian Center for Artificial Intelligence (hessian.AI) has its headquarters in Darmstadt.\nUnited States military presence.\nU.S. forces entered the city of Darmstadt on 25 March 1945. At the end of World War II, Darmstadt was among the 112 communities where U.S. forces were stationed. Early units stationed here included elements of the U.S. Constabulary, Air Force units and a Quartermaster School.\nOver the years, the U.S. military community Darmstadt \u2013 under a variety of designations such as the 440th Signal Battalion, served as home for thousands of American soldiers and their families. It included six principal installations in Darmstadt and nearby Babenhausen, Griesheim and M\u00fcnster, plus several housing areas, an airfield and a large number of smaller facilities as far away as Bensheim and Aschaffenburg. The military newspaper European \"Stars and Stripes\" also had its headquarters there. As of 1993, the Darmstadt military community also assumed responsibility for the remaining U.S. Army facilities in the Frankfurt area.\nAs part of the U.S. Army's ongoing transformation in Germany, the Darmstadt military community, by then designated U.S. Army Garrison Darmstadt, inactivated on 30 September 2008. Even after the garrison inactivation, however, there is still one unit active in Darmstadt: The 66th Military Intelligence Group at the Dagger Complex on Eberst\u00e4dter Weg. It draws its support from the nearby U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden. The U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden's website mentions the unit still being active in Darmstadt, and a Marine Corps company being stationed there as well. With the exception of Dagger Complex, all remaining US installations are now empty and closed to the public, pending property disposal by the German authorities.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nDarmstadt is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "52255", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52255", "title": "Wild boar", "text": "Species of mammal\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe wild boar (Sus scrofa), also known as the wild swine, common wild pig, Eurasian wild pig, or simply wild pig, is a suid native to much of Eurasia and North Africa, and has been introduced to the Americas and Oceania. The species is now one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well as the most widespread suiform. It has been assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List due to its wide range, high numbers, and adaptability to a diversity of habitats. It has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range. Wild boars probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene and outcompeted other suid species as they spread throughout the Old World.\nAs of 2005[ [update]], up to 16 subspecies are recognized, which are divided into four regional groupings based on skull height and lacrimal bone length. The species lives in matriarchal societies consisting of interrelated females and their young (both male and female). Fully grown males are usually solitary outside the breeding season. The wolf is the wild boar's main predator in most of its natural range except in the Far East and the Lesser Sunda Islands, where it is replaced by the tiger and Komodo dragon respectively. The wild boar has a long history of association with humans, having been the ancestor of most domestic pig breeds and a big-game animal for millennia. Boars have also re-hybridized in recent decades with feral pigs; these boar\u2013pig hybrids have become a serious pest wild animal in the Americas and Australia.\nTerminology.\nAs true wild boars became extinct in Great Britain before the development of Modern English, the same terms are often used for both true wild boar and pigs, especially large or semi-wild ones. The English \"boar\" stems from the Old English , which is thought to be derived from the West Germanic , of unknown origin. \"Boar\" is sometimes used specifically to refer to males, and may also be used to refer to male domesticated pigs, especially breeding males that have not been castrated.\n\"Sow\", the traditional name for a female, again comes from Old English and Germanic; it stems from Proto-Indo-European, and is related to the Latin sus and Ancient Greek \"hus\", and more closely to the New High German . The young may be called \"piglets\" or \"boarlets\".\nThe animals' specific name \"scrofa\" is Latin for 'sow'.\nHunting.\nIn hunting terminology, boars are given different designations according to their age:\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nMtDNA studies indicate that the wild boar originated from islands in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia and the Philippines, and subsequently spread onto mainland Eurasia and North Africa. The earliest fossil finds of the species come from both Europe and Asia, and date back to the Early Pleistocene. By the late Villafranchian, \"S. scrofa\" largely displaced the related \"S. strozzii\", a large, possibly swamp-adapted suid ancestral to the modern \"S. verrucosus\" throughout the Eurasian mainland, restricting it to insular Asia. Its closest wild relative is the bearded pig of Malacca and surrounding islands.\nSubspecies.\nAs of 2005[ [update]], 16 subspecies are recognised, which are divided into four regional groupings:\nDomestication.\nWith the exception of domestic pigs in Timor and Papua New Guinea (which appear to be of Sulawesi warty pig stock), the wild boar is the ancestor of most pig breeds. Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar as early as 13,000\u201312,700\u00a0BCE in the Near East in the Tigris Basin, being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400\u00a0BCE in Cyprus. Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then. There was also a separate domestication in China, which took place about 8,000 years ago.\nDNA evidence from sub-fossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East. This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boars, resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock. Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported in turn to the ancient Near East. Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Domestic pigs tend to have much more developed hindquarters than their wild boar ancestors, to the point where 70% of their body weight is concentrated in the posterior, which is the opposite of wild boar, where most of the muscles are concentrated on the head and shoulders.\nSynonymous species.\nThe Heude's pig (\"Sus bucculentus\"), also known as the Indochinese warty pig or Vietnam warty pig, was an alleged pig species found in Laos and Vietnam. It was virtually unknown and was feared extinct, until the discovery of a skull from a recently killed individual in the Annamite Range, Laos, in 1995. Subsequent studies indicated that \"Sus bucculentus\" was not a valid taxon. As of 2022 the Mammal Diversity Database included it in \"Sus scrofa\".\nDescription.\nThe wild boar is a bulky, massively built suid with short and relatively thin legs. The trunk is short and robust, while the hindquarters are comparatively underdeveloped. The region behind the shoulder blades rises into a hump and the neck is short and thick to the point of being nearly immobile. The animal's head is very large, taking up to one-third of the body's entire length. The structure of the head is well suited for digging. The head acts as a plough, while the powerful neck muscles allow the animal to upturn considerable amounts of soil: it is capable of digging into frozen ground and can upturn rocks weighing . The eyes are small and deep-set and the ears long and broad. The species has well developed canine teeth, which protrude from the mouths of adult males. The medial hooves are larger and more elongated than the lateral ones and are capable of quick movements. The animal can run at a maximum speed of 40\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph) and jump at a height of .\nSexual dimorphism is very pronounced in the species, with males being typically 5\u201310% larger and 20\u201330% heavier than females. Males also sport a mane running down the back, which is particularly apparent during autumn and winter. The canine teeth are also much more prominent in males and grow throughout life. The upper canines are relatively short and grow sideways early in life, though they gradually curve upwards. The lower canines are much sharper and longer, with the exposed parts measuring in length. In the breeding period, males develop a coating of subcutaneous tissue, which may be thick, extending from the shoulder blades to the rump, thus protecting vital organs during fights. Males sport a roughly chicken egg\u2013sized sac of unclear function near the opening of the penis that collects urine and emits a sharp odour.\nAdult size and weight is largely determined by environmental factors; boars living in arid areas with little productivity tend to attain smaller sizes than their counterparts inhabiting areas with abundant food and water. In most of Europe, males average in weight, in shoulder height and in body length, whereas females average in weight, in shoulder height and in body length. In Europe's Mediterranean regions, males may reach average weights as low as and females , with shoulder heights of . In the more productive areas of Eastern Europe, males average in weight, in shoulder height and in body length, while females weigh , reach in shoulder height, and reach in body length. In Western and Central Europe, the largest males weigh and females . In Northeastern Asia, large males can reach brown bear-like sizes, weighing and measuring in shoulder height. Some adult males in Primorsky Krai and Manchuria have been recorded to weigh and measure in shoulder height. Adults of this size are generally immune from wolf predation. Such giants are rare in modern times, as past overhunting has prevented animals from attaining their full growth.\nThe winter coat consists of long, coarse bristles underlaid with short brown downy fur. The length of these bristles varies along the body, with the shortest being around the face and limbs and the longest running along the back. These back bristles form the aforementioned mane prominent in males and stand erect when the animal is agitated. Colour is highly variable; specimens around Lake Balkhash are very lightly coloured, and can even be white, while some boars from Belarus and Ussuriland can be black. Some subspecies sport a light-coloured patch running backward from the corners of the mouth. Coat colour also varies with age, with piglets having light brown or rusty-brown fur with pale bands extending from the flanks and back.\nThe wild boar produces a number of different sounds which are divided into three categories:\nIts sense of smell is very well developed to the point that the animal is used for drug detection in Germany. Its hearing is also acute, though its eyesight is comparatively weak, lacking color vision and being unable to recognise a standing human away.\nPigs are one of four known mammalian taxa which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom. Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom \u03b1-neurotoxin from binding. These represent four separate, independent mutations.\nSocial behaviour and life cycle.\nBoars are typically social animals, living in female-dominated sounders consisting of barren sows and mothers with young led by an old matriarch. Male boars leave their sounder at the age of 8\u201315 months, while females either remain with their mothers or establish new territories nearby. Subadult males may live in loosely knit groups, while adult and elderly males tend to be solitary outside the breeding season.\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;breeding period in most areas lasts from November to January, though most mating only lasts a month and a half. Prior to mating, the males develop their subcutaneous armour in preparation for confronting rivals. The testicles double in size and the glands secrete a foamy yellowish liquid. Once ready to reproduce, males travel long distances in search of a sounder of sows, eating little on the way. Once a sounder has been located, the male drives off all young animals and persistently chases the sows. At this point, the male fiercely fights potential rivals. A single male can mate with 5\u201310 sows. By the end of the rut, males are often badly mauled and have lost 20% of their body weight, with bite-induced injuries to the penis being common. The gestation period varies according to the age of the expecting mother. For first-time breeders, it lasts 114\u2013130 days, while it lasts 133\u2013140 days in older sows. Farrowing occurs between March and May, with litter sizes depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The average litter consists of 4\u20136 piglets, with the maximum being 10\u201312. The piglets are whelped in a nest constructed from twigs, grasses and leaves. Should the mother die prematurely, the piglets are adopted by the other sows in the sounder.\nNewborn piglets weigh around 600\u20131,000 grams, lacking underfur and bearing a single milk incisor and canine on each half of the jaw. There is intense competition between the piglets over the most milk-rich nipples, as the best-fed young grow faster and have stronger constitutions. The piglets do not leave the lair for their first week of life. Should the mother be absent, the piglets lie closely pressed to each other. By two weeks of age, the piglets begin accompanying their mother on her journeys. Should danger be detected, the piglets take cover or stand immobile, relying on their camouflage to keep them hidden. The neonatal coat fades after three months, with adult colouration being attained at eight months. Although the lactation period lasts 2.5\u20133.5 months, the piglets begin displaying adult feeding behaviours at the age of 2\u20133 weeks. The permanent dentition is fully formed by 1\u20132 years. With the exception of the canines in males, the teeth stop growing during the middle of the fourth year. The canines in old males continue to grow throughout their lives, curving strongly as they age. Sows attain sexual maturity at the age of one year, with males attaining it a year later. However, estrus usually first occurs after two years in sows, while males begin participating in the rut after 4\u20135 years, as they are not permitted to mate by the older males. The maximum lifespan in the wild is 10\u201314 years, though few specimens survive past 4\u20135 years. Boars in captivity have lived for 20 years.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nHabitat and sheltering.\nThe wild boar inhabits a diverse array of habitats from boreal taigas to deserts. In mountainous regions, it can even occupy alpine zones, occurring up to in the Carpathians, in the Caucasus and up to in the mountains in Central Asia and Kazakhstan. In order to survive in a given area, wild boars require a habitat fulfilling three conditions: heavily brushed areas providing shelter from predators, water for drinking and bathing purposes and an absence of regular snowfall.\nThe main habitats favored by boars in Europe are deciduous and mixed forests, with the most favorable areas consisting of forest composed of oak and beech enclosing marshes and meadows. In the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, the animal's primary habitat consists of well-developed broad-leaved and mixed forests, along with marshy mixed forests, with coniferous forests and undergrowths being of secondary importance. Forests made up entirely of oak groves and beeches are used only during the fruit-bearing season. This is in contrast to the Caucasian and Transcaucasian mountain areas, where boars will occupy such fruit-bearing forests year-round. In the mountainous areas of the Russian Far East, the species inhabits nutpine groves, hilly mixed forests where Mongolian oak and Korean pine are present, swampy mixed taiga and coastal oak forests. In Transbaikalia, boars are restricted to river valleys with nut pine and shrubs. Boars are regularly encountered in pistachio groves in winter in some areas of Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, while in spring they migrate to open deserts; boar have also colonized deserts in several areas they have been introduced to.\nOn the islands of Komodo and Rinca, the boar mostly inhabits savanna or open monsoon forests, avoiding heavily forested areas unless pursued by humans. Wild boar are known to be competent swimmers, capable of covering long distances. In 2013, one boar was reported to have completed the swim from France to Alderney in the Channel Islands. Due to concerns about disease, it was shot and incinerated.\nWild boar rest in shelters, which contain insulating material like spruce branches and dry hay. These resting places are occupied by whole families (though males lie separately) and are often located in the vicinity of streams, in swamp forests and in tall grass or shrub thickets. Boars never defecate in their shelters and will cover themselves with soil and pine needles when irritated by insects.\nDiet.\nThe wild boar is a highly versatile omnivore, whose diversity in choice of food is comparable to that of humans. Its foods can be divided into four categories:\nA boar needs around 4,000\u20134,500 calories of food per day, though this required amount increases during winter and pregnancy, with the majority of its diet consisting of food items dug from the ground, like underground plant material and burrowing animals. Acorns and beechnuts are invariably its most important food items in temperate zones, as they are rich in the carbohydrates necessary for the buildup of fat reserves needed to survive lean periods. In Western Europe, underground plant material favoured by boars includes bracken, willow herb, bulbs, meadow herb roots and bulbs and the bulbs of cultivated crops. Such food is favoured in early spring and summer, but may also be eaten in autumn and winter during beechnut and acorn crop failures. Should regular wild foods become scarce, boars will eat tree bark and fungi, as well as visit cultivated potato and artichoke fields. Boar soil disturbance and foraging have been shown to facilitate invasive plants. Boars of the \"vittatus\" subspecies in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java differ from most other populations by their primarily frugivorous diet, which consists of 50 different fruit species, especially figs, thus making them important seed dispersers. The wild boar can consume numerous genera of poisonous plants without ill effect, including \"Aconitum\", \"Anemone\", \"Calla\", \"Caltha\", \"Ferula\" and \"Pteridium\".\nBoars may occasionally prey on small vertebrates like newborn deer fawns, leporids and galliform chicks, as well as small calves, lambs and other livestock. Boars inhabiting the Volga Delta and near some lakes and rivers of Kazakhstan have been recorded to feed extensively on fish like carp and Caspian roach. Boars in the former area also feed on cormorant and heron chicks, bivalved molluscs, trapped muskrats and mice. There is at least one record of a wild boar killing and eating a bonnet macaque in southern India's Bandipur National Park, though this may have been a case of intraguild predation, brought on by interspecific competition for human handouts. There is also at least one recorded case of a group of wild boar attacking, killing, and eating an adult, healthy female axis deer (\"Axis axis\") as a pack.\nStable isotope analysis of fossil wild boar tooth enamel from the late Middle Pleistocene found in Thailand indicate that it fed on a versatile mixed vegetation.\nPredators.\nPiglets are vulnerable to attack from medium-sized felids like Eurasian lynx (\"Lynx lynx\"), jungle cats (\"Felis chaus\"), and snow leopards (\"Panthera uncia\"), as well as other carnivorans like brown bears (\"Ursus arctos\") and yellow-throated martens (\"Martes flavigula\").\nThe wolf (\"Canis lupus\") is the main predator of wild boar throughout most of its range. A single wolf can kill around 50 to 80 boars of differing ages in one year. In Italy and Belarus' Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park, boars are the wolf's primary prey, despite an abundance of alternative, less powerful ungulates. Wolves are particularly threatening during the winter, when deep snow impedes the boars' movements. In the Baltic regions, heavy snowfall can allow wolves to eliminate boars from an area almost completely. Wolves primarily target piglets and subadults and only rarely attack adult sows. Adult males are usually avoided entirely. Dholes (\"Cuon alpinus\") may also prey on boars, to the point of keeping their numbers down in northwestern Bhutan, despite there being many more cattle in the area.\nLeopards (\"Panthera pardus\") are predators of wild boar in the Caucasus (particularly Transcaucasia), the Russian Far East, India, China and Iran. In most areas, boars constitute only a small part of the leopard's diet. However, in Iran's Sarigol National Park, boars are the second most frequently targeted prey species after mouflon (\"Ovis gmelini\"), though adult individuals are generally avoided, as they are above the leopard's preferred weight range of . This dependence on wild boar is largely due in part to the local leopard subspecies' large size.\nBoars of all ages were once the primary prey of the tiger (\"Panthera tigris\") in Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan, Middle Asia and the Far East up until the late 19th century. In modern times, tiger numbers are too low to have a limiting effect on boar populations. A single tiger can systematically destroy an entire sounder by preying on its members one by one, before moving on to another sounder. Tigers have been noted to chase boars for longer distances than with other prey. In two rare cases, boars were reported to gore a small tiger and a tigress to death in self-defense. A \"large male tiger\" died of wounds inflicted by an old wild boar it had killed in \"a battle royal\" between the two animals.\nIn the Amur region, wild boars are one of the two most important prey species for Siberian tigers, alongside the Manchurian wapiti (\"Cervus canadensis xanthopygus\"), with the two species collectively comprising roughly 80% of the felid's prey. In Sikhote Alin, a tiger can kill 30\u201334 boars a year. Studies of tigers in India indicate that boars are usually secondary in preference to various cervids and bovids, though when boars are targeted, healthy adults are caught more frequently than young and sick specimens.\nOn the islands of Komodo, Rinca and Flores, the boar's main predator is the Komodo dragon (\"Varanus komodoensis\").\nDistribution and habitat.\nReconstructed range.\nThe species originally occurred in North Africa and much of Eurasia; from the British Isles to Korea and the Sunda Islands. The northern limit of its range extended from southern Scandinavia to southern Siberia and Japan. Within this range, it was only absent in extremely dry deserts and alpine zones. It was once found in North Africa along the Nile valley up to Khartoum and north of the Sahara. The species occurs on a few Ionian and Aegean Islands, sometimes swimming between islands. The reconstructed northern boundary of the animal's Asian range ran from Lake Ladoga (at 60\u00b0N) through the area of Novgorod and Moscow into the southern Urals, where it reached 52\u00b0N. From there, the boundary passed Ishim and farther east the Irtysh at 56\u00b0N. In the eastern Baraba steppe (near Novosibirsk) the boundary turned steep south, encircled the Altai Mountains and went again eastward including the Tannu-Ola Mountains and Lake Baikal. From here, the boundary went slightly north of the Amur River eastward to its lower reaches at the Sea of Okhotsk. On Sakhalin, there are only fossil reports of wild boar. The southern boundaries in Europe and Asia were almost invariably identical to the seashores of these continents. It is absent in the dry regions of Mongolia from 44 to 46\u00b0N southward, in China westward of Sichuan and in India north of the Himalayas. It is absent in the higher elevations of the Pamir and the Tian Shan, though they do occur in the Tarim Basin and on the lower slopes of the Tian Shan.\nPresent range.\nIn recent centuries, the range of wild boar has changed dramatically, largely due to hunting by humans and more recently because of captive wild boar escaping into the wild. Prior to the 20th century, boar populations had declined in numerous areas, with British populations probably becoming extinct during the 13th century. In the warm period after the ice age, wild boar lived in the southern parts of Sweden and Norway and north of Lake Ladoga in Karelia. It was previously thought that the species did not live in Finland during prehistory because no prehistoric wild boar bones had been found within the borders of the country. It was not until 2013, when a wild boar bone was found in Askola, that the species was found to have lived in Finland more than 8,000 years ago. It is believed, however, that man prevented its establishment by hunting. In Denmark, the last boar was shot at the beginning of the 19th century, and by 1900 they were absent in Tunisia and Sudan and large areas of Germany, Austria and Italy. In Russia, they were extirpated in wide areas by the 1930s. The last boar in Egypt reportedly died on 20 December 1912 in the Giza Zoo, with wild populations having disappeared by 1894\u20131902. Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein attempted to repopulate Wadi El Natrun with boars of Hungarian stock, but they were quickly exterminated by poachers.\nA revival of boar populations began in the middle of the 20th century. By 1950, wild boar had once again reached their original northern boundary in many parts of their Asiatic range. By 1960, they reached Leningrad and Moscow and by 1975, they were to be found in Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan. In the 1970s they again occurred in Denmark and Sweden, where captive animals escaped and now survive in the wild. In England, wild boar populations re-established themselves in the 1990s, after escaping from specialist farms that had imported European stock.\nStatus in Great Britain.\nBy the 11th century, wild boars were apparently already becoming rare in Britain. A 1087 forestry law enacted by William the Conqueror punished through blinding the unlawful killing of a boar. Charles I attempted to reintroduce the species into the New Forest, but this population was exterminated in the 17th century during the English Civil War. Between their medieval extinction and the 1980s, when wild boar farming began, only a handful of captive wild boar, imported from the continent, were present in Britain. Occasional escapes of wild boar from wildlife parks have occurred as early as the 1970s, but since the early 1990s significant populations have re-established themselves after escapes from farms, the number of which has increased as the demand for meat from the species has grown. A 1998 MAFF (now DEFRA) study on wild boar living wild in Britain confirmed the presence of two populations of wild boar living in Britain; one in Kent/East Sussex and another in Dorset.\nAnother DEFRA report, in February 2008, confirmed the existence of these two sites as 'established breeding areas' and identified a third in Gloucestershire/Herefordshire; in the Forest of Dean/Ross on Wye area. A 'new breeding population' was also identified in Devon. There is another significant population in Dumfries and Galloway. Populations estimates were as follows:\nPopulation estimates for the Forest of Dean are disputed as, at the time that the DEFRA population estimate was 100, a photo of a boar sounder in the forest near Staunton with over 33 animals visible was published and at about the same time over 30 boar were seen in a field near the original escape location of Weston under Penyard many kilometres or miles away. In early 2010 the Forestry Commission embarked on a cull, with the aim of reducing the boar population from an estimated 150 animals to 100. By August it was stated that efforts were being made to reduce the population from 200 to 90, but that only 25 had been killed. The failure to meet cull targets was confirmed in February 2011.\nWild boars have crossed the River Wye into Monmouthshire, Wales. Iolo Williams, the BBC Wales wildlife expert, attempted to film Welsh boar in late 2012. Many other sightings, across the UK, have also been reported. The effects of wild boar on the U.K.'s woodlands were discussed with Ralph Harmer of the Forestry Commission on the BBC Radio's \"Farming Today\" radio programme in 2011. The programme prompted activist writer George Monbiot to propose a thorough population study, followed by the introduction of permit-controlled culling.\nIn Scotland, wild boar are professionally referred to as 'feral pigs' as the genetics of the established feral populations may come from a mix of both wild boar and domestic pigs. They are now known to be present in Dumfries and Galloway and a number of sites in the Highlands, mainly centred around the Loch Ness area. They can be killed there legally without a license and are culled by land managers as wild populations appear occasionally. As of 2024[ [update]], an agency that advises the Scottish government estimates that Scotland is home to a few thousand wild boars. Locals around Loch Ness that were interviewed by \"The New York Times\" believed that the boars were becoming an increasingly worse problem, and farmers noted that they had killed and eaten several lambs.\nIntroduction to North America.\nWild boars are an invasive species in the Americas, having been introduced by European explorers and settlers in the 16th century to serve as a source of food. Wild boars now cause problems including out-competing native species for food, destroying the nests of ground-nesting species, killing fawns and young domestic livestock, destroying agricultural crops, eating tree seeds and seedlings, destroying native vegetation and wetlands through wallowing, damaging water quality, coming into violent conflict with humans and pets and carrying pig and human diseases including brucellosis, trichinosis and pseudorabies. In some jurisdictions, it is illegal to import, breed, release, possess, sell, distribute, trade, transport, hunt, or trap Eurasian boars. Hunting and trapping is done systematically, to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boars, which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunters.\nHistory.\nWhile domestic pigs, both captive and feral (popularly termed \"razorbacks\"), have been in North America since the earliest days of European colonization, pure wild boars were not introduced into the New World until the 19th century. The suids were released into the wild by wealthy landowners as big game animals. The initial introductions took place in fenced enclosures, though several escapes occurred, with the escapees sometimes intermixing with already established feral pig populations.\nThe first of these introductions occurred in New Hampshire in 1890. Thirteen wild boars from Germany were purchased by Austin Corbin from Carl Hagenbeck and released into a game preserve in Sullivan County. Several of these boars escaped, though they were quickly hunted down by locals. Two further introductions were made from the original stocking, with several escapes taking place due to breaches in the game preserve's fencing. These escapees have ranged widely, with some specimens having been observed crossing into Vermont.\nIn 1902, 15\u201320 wild boar from Germany were released into a estate in Hamilton County, New York. Several specimens escaped six years later, dispersing into the William C. Whitney Wilderness Area, with their descendants surviving for at least 20 years.\nThe most extensive boar introduction in the US took place in western North Carolina in 1912, when 13 boars of undetermined European origin were released into two fenced enclosures in a game preserve in Hooper Bald, Graham County. Most of the specimens remained in the preserve for the next decade, until a large-scale hunt caused the remaining animals to break through their confines and escape. Some of the boars migrated to Tennessee, where they intermixed with both free-ranging and feral pigs in the area. In 1924, a dozen Hooper Bald wild pigs were shipped to California and released in a property between Carmel Valley and the Los Padres National Forest. These hybrid boar were later used as breeding stock on various private and public lands throughout the state, as well as in other states like Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, West Virginia and Mississippi.\nSeveral wild boars from Leon Springs and the San Antonio, Saint Louis and San Diego Zoos were released in the Powder Horn Ranch in Calhoun County, Texas, in 1939. These specimens escaped and established themselves in surrounding ranchlands and coastal areas, with some crossing the Espiritu Santo Bay and colonizing Matagorda Island. Descendants of the Powder Horn Ranch boars were later released onto San Jos\u00e9 Island and the coast of Chalmette, Louisiana.\nWild boar of unknown origin were stocked in a ranch in the Edwards Plateau in the 1940s, only to escape during a storm and hybridize with local feral pig populations, later spreading into neighboring counties.\nStarting in the mid-1980s, several boars purchased from the San Diego Zoo and Tierpark Berlin were released into the United States. A decade later, more specimens from farms in Canada and Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest were let loose. In recent years, wild pig populations have been reported in 44 states within the US, most of which are likely wild boar\u2013feral hog hybrids. Pure wild boar populations may still be present, but are extremely localized.\nIntroduction and lack of control in South America.\nIn South America, the European boar is believed to have been introduced for the first time in Argentina and Uruguay around the 20th century for breeding purposes. In Brazil, the creation of wild boar and hybrids started on a large scale in the mid-1990s. With the invasion of wild boar that crossed the border and entered Rio Grande do Sul around 1989, and the escape and intentional release by several Brazilian breeders in the late 1990s \u2013 in response to a IBAMA decision against the import and breeding of wild boar in 1998 \u2013 numerous feral species formed a growing population, which progressively advances in Brazilian territory.\nPest control in Brazil.\nAs a form of control for the wild boar population, hunting and killing are allowed for Collectors, Shooters and Hunters (CACs) duly registered by the environmental control agency, IBAMA, which, on the other hand, seeks to encourage the preservation of similar species of native peccaries, such as the \"queixada\" and the \"caititu\".\nEffect on other habitats.\nWild boars negatively impact other habitats through the destruction of the environment, or homes of wildlife. When wild boars invade new areas, they adapt to the new area by trampling and rooting, as well as displacing many saplings/nutrients. This causes a decrease in growing of many plants and trees. Water is also affected negatively by wild boars. When wild boars are active in streams, or small pools of water, it causes increased turbidity (excessive silt and particle suspension). In some cases, the fecal coliform concentration increases to dangerous levels because of wild boars. Aquatic wildlife is affected, more prominently fish, and amphibians. Wild boars have caused a great decrease in over 300 animal or plant species, 250 being endangered or threatened.\nThe boars cause many habitats to become less diverse because of their feeding behaviors and predation. Wild boars will dig up eggs of species and eat them, as well as killing other wildlife for food. When these boars compete with other species for resources, they usually come out successful. A study published in the Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology was conducted on the results of Feral Swine control. Only two years after the control started, the amount of turtle nests jumped from 57 to 143, and the turtle nest predation percent dropped from 74 to 15. They kill and eat deers, lizards, birds, snakes, and more. These boars are called \"opportunist omnivores\", which means they eat almost anything. This means they can survive almost anywhere. A big surplus of food and the ability to adapt to any new place causes lots of breeding. All of these factors make it difficult to get rid of wild boars.\nDiseases and parasites.\nWild boars are known to host at least 20 different parasitic worm species, with maximum infections occurring in summer. Young animals are vulnerable to helminths like \"Metastrongylus\", which are consumed by boars through earthworms and cause death by parasitising the lungs. Wild boar also carry parasites known to infect humans, including \"Gastrodiscoides\", \"Trichinella spiralis\", \"Taenia solium\", \"Balantidium coli\" and \"Toxoplasma gondii\". Wild boar in southern regions are frequently infested with ticks (\"Dermacentor\", \"Rhipicephalus\", and \"Hyalomma\") and hog lice. The species also suffers from blood-sucking flies, which it escapes by bathing frequently or hiding in dense shrubs.\nSwine plague spreads very quickly in wild boar, with epizootics being recorded in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, the Caucasus, the Far East, Kazakhstan and other regions. Foot-and-mouth disease can also take on epidemic proportions in boar populations. The species occasionally, but rarely contracts \"Pasteurellosis\", hemorrhagic sepsis, tularemia, and anthrax. Wild boar may on occasion contract swine erysipelas through rodents or hog lice and ticks.\nRelationships with humans.\nIn culture.\nThe wild boar features prominently in the cultures of Indo-European people, many of which saw the animal as embodying warrior virtues. Cultures throughout Europe and Asia Minor saw the killing of a boar as proof of one's valor and strength. Neolithic hunter gatherers depicted reliefs of ferocious wild boars on their temple pillars at G\u00f6bekli Tepe some 11,600 years ago. Virtually all heroes in Greek mythology fight or kill a boar at one point. The demigod Herakles' third labour involves the capture of the Erymanthian Boar, Theseus slays the wild sow Phaea, and a disguised Odysseus is recognised by his handmaiden Eurycleia by the scars inflicted on him by a boar during a hunt in his youth. To the mythical Hyperboreans, the boar represented spiritual authority. Several Greek myths use the boar as a symbol of darkness, death and winter. One example is the story of the youthful Adonis, who is killed by a boar and is permitted by Zeus to depart from Hades only during the spring and summer period. This theme also occurs in Irish and Egyptian mythology, where the animal is explicitly linked to the month of October, therefore autumn. This association likely arose from aspects of the boar's actual nature. Its dark colour was linked to the night, while its solitary habits, proclivity to consume crops and nocturnal nature were associated with evil. The foundation myth of Ephesus has the city being built over the site where Prince Androklos of Athens killed a boar. Boars were frequently depicted on Greek funerary monuments alongside lions, representing gallant losers who have finally met their match, as opposed to victorious hunters as lions are. The theme of the doomed, yet valorous boar warrior also occurred in Hittite culture, where it was traditional to sacrifice a boar alongside a dog and a prisoner of war after a military defeat.\nThe boar as a warrior also appears in Germanic cultures, with its image having been frequently engraved on shields and swords. They also feature on Germanic boar helmets, such as the Benty Grange helmet, where it was believed to offer protection to the wearer and has been theorised to have been used in spiritual transformations into swine, similar to berserkers. The boar features heavily in religious practice in Germanic paganism where it is closely associated with Freyr and has also been suggested to have been a totemic animal to the Swedes, especially to the Yngling royal dynasty who claimed descent from the god.\nAccording to Tacitus, the Baltic Aesti featured boars on their helmets and may have also worn boar masks. The boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the Celts, who considered them to be their most important sacred animal. Some Celtic deities linked to boars include Moccus and Veteris. It has been suggested that some early myths surrounding the Welsh hero Culhwch involved the character being the son of a boar god. Nevertheless, the importance of the boar as a culinary item among Celtic tribes may have been exaggerated in popular culture by the \"Asterix\" series, as wild boar bones are rare among Celtic archaeological sites and the few that do occur show no signs of butchery, having probably been used in sacrificial rituals.\nThe boar also appears in Vedic mythology and Hindu mythology. A story present in the Brahmanas has the god Indra slaying an avaricious boar, who has stolen the treasure of the asuras, then giving its carcass to the god Vishnu, who offered it as a sacrifice to the gods. In the story's retelling in the Charaka Samhita, the boar is described as a form of Prajapati and is credited with having raised the Earth from the primeval waters. In the Ramayana and the Puranas, the same boar is portrayed as Varaha, an avatar of Vishnu.\nIn Japanese culture, the boar is widely seen as a fearsome and reckless animal, to the point that several words and expressions in Japanese referring to recklessness include references to boars. The boar is the last animal of the Oriental zodiac, with people born during the year of the Pig being said to embody the boar-like traits of determination and impetuosity. Among Japanese hunters, the boar's courage and defiance is a source of admiration and it is not uncommon for hunters and mountain people to name their sons after the animal \"inoshishi\" (\u732a). Boars are also seen as symbols of fertility and prosperity; in some regions, it is thought that boars are drawn to fields owned by families including pregnant women, and hunters with pregnant wives are thought to have greater chances of success when boar hunting. The animal's link to prosperity was illustrated by its inclusion on the \u00a510 note during the Meiji period and it was once believed that a man could become wealthy by keeping a clump of boar hair in his wallet.\nIn the folklore of the Mongol Altai Uriankhai tribe, the wild boar was associated with the watery underworld, as it was thought that the spirits of the dead entered the animal's head, to be ultimately transported to the water. Prior to the conversion to Islam, the Kyrgyz people believed that they were descended from boars and thus did not eat pork. In Buryat mythology, the forefathers of the Buryats descended from heaven and were nourished by a boar. In China, the boar is the emblem of the Miao people.\nThe boar (sanglier) is frequently displayed in English, Scottish and Welsh heraldry. As with the lion, the boar is often shown as armed and langued. As with the bear, Scottish and Welsh heraldry displays the boar's head with the neck cropped, unlike the English version, which retains the neck. The white boar served as the badge of King Richard III of England, who distributed it among his northern retainers during his tenure as Duke of Gloucester.\nAs a game animal and food source.\nHumans have been hunting boar for millennia, the earliest artistic depictions of such activities dating back to the Upper Paleolithic. At some archaeological sites in China dating back to the Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO), boar composed up to 73% of all medium and large mammal remains, indicating heavy reliance on these suids as a food source. The animal was seen as a source of food among the Ancient Greeks, as well as a sporting challenge and source of epic narratives. The Romans inherited this tradition, with one of its first practitioners being Scipio Aemilianus. Boar hunting became particularly popular among the young nobility during the 3rd century BC as preparation for manhood and battle. A typical Roman boar hunting tactic involved surrounding a given area with large nets, then flushing the boar with dogs and immobilizing it with smaller nets. The animal would then be dispatched with a \"venabulum\", a short spear with a crossguard at the base of the blade. More than their Greek predecessors, the Romans extensively took inspiration from boar hunting in their art and sculpture. With the ascension of Constantine the Great, boar hunting took on Christian allegorical themes, with the animal being portrayed as a \"black beast\" analogous to the dragon of Saint George.\nBoar hunting continued after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, though the Germanic tribes considered the red deer to be a more noble and worthy quarry. The post-Roman nobility hunted boar as their predecessors did, but primarily as training for battle rather than sport. It was not uncommon for medieval hunters to deliberately hunt boars during the breeding season when the animals were more aggressive. During the Renaissance, when deforestation and the introduction of firearms reduced boar numbers, boar hunting became the sole prerogative of the nobility, one of many charges brought up against the rich during the German Peasants' War and the French Revolution.\nDuring the mid-20th century, 7,000\u20138,000 boars were caught in the Caucasus, 6,000\u20137,000 in Kazakhstan and about 5,000 in Central Asia during the Soviet period, primarily through the use of dogs and beats. In Nepal, farmers and poachers eliminate boars by baiting balls of wheat flour containing explosives with kerosene oil, with the animals' chewing motions triggering the devices.\nWild boar can thrive in captivity, though piglets grow slowly and poorly without their mothers. Products derived from wild boar include meat, hide and bristles. \"Apicius\" devotes a whole chapter to the cooking of boar meat, providing 10 recipes involving roasting, boiling and what sauces to use. The Romans usually served boar meat with garum. Boar's head was the centrepiece of most medieval Christmas celebrations among the nobility. Although growing in popularity as a captive-bred source of food, the wild boar takes longer to mature than most domestic pigs and it is usually smaller and produces less meat. Nevertheless, wild boar meat is leaner and healthier than pork, being of higher nutritional value and having a much higher concentration of essential amino acids. Most meat-dressing organizations agree that a boar carcass should yield of meat on average. Large specimens can yield of fat, with some giants yielding or more. A boar hide can measure and can yield of bristle and of underwool.\nCrop and garbage raiding.\nBoars can be damaging to agriculture in situations where their natural habitat is sparse. Populations living on the outskirts of towns or farms can dig up potatoes and damage melons, watermelons and maize. However, they generally only encroach upon farms when natural food is scarce. In the Belovezh forest for example, 34\u201347% of the local boar population will enter fields in years of moderate availability of natural foods. While the role of boars in damaging crops is often exaggerated, cases are known of boar depredations causing famines, as was the case in Hachinohe, Japan in 1749, where 3,000 people died of what became known as the \"wild boar famine\". Still, within Japanese culture, the boar's status as vermin is expressed through its title as \"king of pests\" and the popular saying (addressed to young men in rural areas) \"When you get married, choose a place with no wild boar.\"\nIn Central Europe, farmers typically repel boars through distraction or fright, while in Kazakhstan it is usual to employ guard dogs in plantations. However, research shows that when compared with other mitigation tactics, hunting is the only strategy to significantly reduce crop damage by boars. Although large boar populations can play an important role in limiting forest growth, they are also useful in keeping pest populations such as June bugs under control. The growth of urban areas and the corresponding decline in natural boar habitats has led to some sounders entering human habitations in search of food. As in natural conditions, sounders in peri-urban areas are matriarchal, though males tend to be much less represented and adults of both sexes can be up to 35% heavier than their forest-dwelling counterparts. As of 2010, at least 44 cities in 15 countries have experienced problems of some kind relating to the presence of habituated wild boar.\nA 2023 study found that allowing wild pigs to forage on edible garbage in large regional landfills results in those animals getting physically large/heavier, having larger litters of piglets, and causing more wild pig-vehicle collisions in the vicinity of the landfill. The effects of letting these pigs scavenge in these landfills can present unique challenges to population management, control, public safety, and disease transmission. Wild pigs foraging on edible food waste in landfills has also been identified as a vector that facilitates the spread of African swine fever virus.\nAttacks on humans.\nActual attacks on humans are rare, but can be serious, resulting in penetrating injuries to the lower part of the body. They generally occur during the boars' rutting season from November to January, in agricultural areas bordering forests or on paths leading through forests. The animal typically attacks by charging and pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries occurring on the thigh region. Once the initial attack is over, the boar steps back, takes position and attacks again if the victim is still moving, only ending once the victim is completely incapacitated.\nBoar attacks on humans have been documented throughout history. The Romans and Ancient Greeks wrote of these attacks (Odysseus was wounded by a boar and Adonis was killed by one). A 2012 study compiling recorded attacks from 1825 to 2012 found accounts of 665 human victims of both wild boars and feral pigs: the highest number of those attacks (24%) occurred in the United States, though the next-highest (19%), in India, was also the greatest percentage of attacks occurring in the animal's native range. Most of the attacks occurred in rural areas during the winter months in non-hunting contexts and were committed by solitary males.\nManagement.\nManaging wild boar is a pressing task in both native and invasive contexts as they can be disruptive to other systems when not addressed. Wild boar find their success through adaptation of daily patterns to circumvent threats. They avoid human contact through nocturnal lifestyles, despite the fact that they are not evolutionarily predisposed, and alter their diets substantially based on what is available. These \"adaptive generalists\", can survive in a variety of landscapes, making the prediction of their movement patterns and any potential close contact areas crucial to limiting damage. All of these qualities make them equally difficult to manage or limit.\nWithin Central Europe, the native habitat of the wild boar, there has been a push to re-evaluate interactions between wild boar and humans, with the priority of fostering positive engagement. Negative media and public perception of wild boar as \"crop raiders\" have made those living alongside them less willing to accept the economic damages of their behaviors, as wild boar are seen as pests. This media tone impacts management policy, with every 10 negative articles increasing wild boar policy activity by 6.7%. Contrary to this portrayal, wild boar, when managed well within their natural environments, can be a crucial part of forest ecosystems.\nDefining the limits of proper management is difficult, but the exclusion of wild boar from rare environments is generally agreed upon, as when not properly managed, they can damage agricultural ventures and harm vulnerable plant life. These damages are estimated at $800 million yearly in environmental and financial costs for the United States alone. The breadth of this damage is due to prior inattention and lack of management tactics for extended lengths of time. Managing wild boar is a complex task, as it involves coordinating a combination of crop harvest techniques, fencing, toxic bait, corrals, and hunting. The most common tactic employed by private land owners in the United States is recreational hunting; however, this is generally not as effective on its own. Management strategies are most successful when they take into account reproduction, dispersion, and the differences between ideal resources for males and females.\nWild boars are causing soil disturbance that, among other problems, globally results in annual carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to that of ~1.1 million passenger vehicles (4.9 Mt, 0.01% of all GHG emissions as of 2022), implying that as of 2021, hunted boar meat \u2013 unlike other meat products \u2013 has beneficial effects on the environment even though the effect would diminish if boars are introduced for meat production, so consistently retaining small populations of boars may be preferable.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "52259", "revid": "50991279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52259", "title": "Great Salt Lake", "text": "Salt lake in Utah, United States\nThe Great Salt Lake is the largest saltwater lake in the Western Hemisphere and the eighth-largest terminal lake in the world. It lies in the northern part of the U.S. state of Utah and has a substantial impact upon the local climate, particularly through lake-effect snow. It is a remnant of Lake Bonneville, a prehistoric body of water that covered much of western Utah.\nThe area of the lake can fluctuate substantially due to its low average depth of . In the 1980s, it reached a historic high of , and the West Desert Pumping Project was established to mitigate flooding by pumping water from the lake into the nearby desert. In 2021, after years of sustained drought and increased water diversion upstream of the lake, it fell to its lowest recorded area at , falling below the previous low set in 1963.\nThe lake's three major tributaries, the Jordan, Weber, and Bear rivers together deposit around 1.1\u00a0million tons of minerals in the lake per year. Since the lake has no outlet besides evaporation, these minerals accumulate and give the lake high salinity (far saltier than seawater) and density. This density causes swimming in the lake to feel similar to floating.\nThe lake has been called \"America's Dead Sea\" and provides a habitat for millions of native birds, brine shrimp, shorebirds, and waterfowl, including the largest staging population of Wilson's phalarope in the world.\nOrigin.\nThe Great Salt Lake is a remnant of a much larger prehistoric lake called Lake Bonneville. At its greatest extent, Lake Bonneville spanned , nearly as large as present-day Lake Michigan, and roughly ten times the area of the Great Salt Lake today. Bonneville reached at its deepest point and covered much of present-day Utah and small portions of Idaho and Nevada during the ice ages of the Pleistocene Epoch.\nLake Bonneville existed until about 16,800 years ago, when a large portion of the lake was released through the Red Rock Pass in Idaho, resulting in cataclysmic floods. With the warming climate, the remaining lake began to dry, leaving the Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake behind.\nHistory.\nThere are several maps dating back to 1575 that show the Great Salt Lake at the correct latitude and longitude, within an accuracy of a few degrees. One example is a map by Nicolas Sanson dated 1650. The Great Salt Lake entered written history through the records of Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante, who learned of its existence from the Timpanogos Utes in 1776. No European name was given to it at the time, and it was not shown on the map by Bernardo Miera y Pacheco, the cartographer for the expedition. Escalante had been on the shores of Utah Lake, which he named Laguna Timpanogos. It was the larger of the two lakes that appeared on Miera's map. Other cartographers followed his lead and charted Lake Timpanogos as the largest (or larger) lake in the region. As people became aware of the Great Salt Lake, they interpreted the maps to think that \"Timpanogos\" referred to the Great Salt Lake. On some maps, the two names were used synonymously. In time, \"Timpanogos\" was dropped from the maps, and its original association with Utah Lake was forgotten.\nIn 1824, it was observed, apparently independently, by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Shortly thereafter, other trappers saw it and walked around it. Most of the trappers, however, were illiterate and did not record their discoveries. As oral reports of their findings made their way to those who did make records, some errors were made. In 1843, John C. Fremont led the first scientific expedition to the lake, but with winter coming on, he did not take the time to survey the entire lake. Fremont's glowing reports of the area were published shortly after his expedition, and they influenced the choice of Brigham Young and other members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to settle in the Salt Lake Valley in July 1847. Young visited the lake three days after arriving in the Valley, and it was supplying salt to the settlers within a month.\nThe lake was comprehensively surveyed for the first time in 1850 under the leadership of Howard Stansbury (Stansbury discovered and named the Stansbury mountain range and Stansbury island). Stansbury also published a formal report of his survey work which became very popular. His report of the area included a discussion of Mormon religious practices based on Stansbury's interaction with the Mormon community in Great Salt Lake City.\nBeginning in November 1895, the artist and author Alfred Lambourne spent a year living on the remote Gunnison Island, where he wrote a book of musing and poetry, \"Our Inland Sea\". From November 1895 to March 1896, he was alone. In March, a few guano sifters arrived to harvest and sell the guano of the nesting birds as fertilizer. Lambourne included musings about these guano sifters in his work. Lambourne left the island early in the winter of 1896 along with the first group of guano sifters.\n1930s Fresh Water Project.\nIn the early 1930s, there was a project to dam off a third of the lake with dikes on the east side north of Salt Lake City to make a freshwater reservoir for drinking and irrigation. The project was abandoned before it got beyond the planning stage.\nCauseway.\nThe causeway across the lake was built in the 1950s by the Morrison-Knudsen construction company for the Southern Pacific Railroad as a replacement to a previously built wooden trestle, which was the major component of the Lucin Cutoff. The route is now owned and operated by Union Pacific. About 15 trains cross the causeway each day. Before December 2, 2016, the causeway constrained the flow of water between the northern and southern arms, which had a significant impact on various industries surrounding the lake. The construction of a bridge created an opening of the causeway for water to flow between the arms of the lake.\nWillard Bay Reservoir.\nWillard Bay, also known as Willard Bay Reservoir or Arthur V. Watkins Reservoir, is a freshwater reservoir completed in 1964, which separated, drained, and subsequently filled with fresh water from the Weber River a portion of the Great Salt Lake's northeastern arm.\nWest Desert Pumping Project.\nRecord high water levels in the 1980s caused a large amount of property damage for owners on the eastern side of the Great Salt Lake, and the water started to erode the base of Interstate 80. In response, the State of Utah built the West Desert Pumping Project on the western side of the lake. It began operation on April 10, 1987. This project consists of a pumping station () at Hogup Ridge, containing three pumps with a combined capacity of moving , an inlet canal, and an outlet canal. Also, there are of dikes and a access road between the town of Lakeside and the pumping station.\nThis pumping project was designed to increase the surface area of the Great Salt Lake and thus increase the rate of water evaporation. The pumps drove some of the water of the Great Salt Lake into the Newfoundland Evaporation Basin in the desert west of the lake. A weir in the dike at the southern end of the Newfoundland Mountains regulated the level of water in the basin and it sometimes returned salty water from the evaporation basin into the main body of the Great Salt Lake.\nAt the end of their first year of operation, the pumps had removed about of water from the Great Salt Lake. The project was shut down in June 1989, as the level of the lake had dropped by nearly since reaching its peak levels during June 1986 and March 1987. The Utah Division of Water Resources credits the project with \"over one-third of that decline\". In total, the pumps removed of water while they operated.\nAlthough the pumps are no longer in use, they have been kept in place in case the level of the Great Salt Lake ever rises that high again.\nShrinking.\nDrought conditions, climate change, and the overuse of snowmelt have caused the Great Salt Lake to shrink considerably. As of July 2022, the Great Salt Lake occupies approximately . In 1987, it occupied about . As of March 2023, the lake's highest recorded surface elevation was on April 15, 1987; For comparison, the lowest recorded surface elevation was on December 17, 2022. In 2023, scientists at Brigham Young University estimated that without policy changes, the lake would dry up in 2028, with local species killed off by overly salty water somewhat before that. Continued shrinkage could also turn the lake into a bowl of toxic dust, poisoning the air around Salt Lake City.\nEnvironmentalists proposed establishing a level of above sea level as an official state policy, among other interventions. University of Utah researchers proposed a level between 4,198 and 4,205 feet. A non-binding resolution in the 2023 state legislative session to adopt 4,198 feet was voted down and governor Spencer Cox called it \"dumb\".\nGeography.\nThe Great Salt Lake lends its name to Salt Lake City, originally named \"Great Salt Lake City\" by the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Brigham Young, who led a group of Mormon pioneers to the Salt Lake Valley southeast of the lake on July 24, 1847.\nThe lake lies in parts of five counties: Box Elder, Davis, Tooele, Weber, and Salt Lake. Salt Lake City and its suburbs are located to the south-east and east of the lake, between the lake and the Wasatch Mountains, but land around the north and west shores is almost uninhabited. The Bonneville Salt Flats are to the west, and the Oquirrh and Stansbury Mountains rise to the south.\nThe Great Salt Lake is fed by three major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed directly or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River starts on the north slope of the Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some of Bear River's waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river by means of the Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River also starts on the north slope of the Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas; rather, it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River. The Provo River does originate in the Uintas, a few miles from the Weber and Bear. The Jordan flows from the north part of Utah Lake into the south-east corner of the Great Salt Lake.\nDue to the lake's shallowness, the water level can fall and rise dramatically during dry years or high-precipitation years, thereby reflecting prolonged drought or wet periods. The change in the level of lake level is strongly modulated by the Pacific Ocean through atmospheric circulations that fluctuate at low frequency. By capturing these climate oscillations while using tree-ring reconstruction of lake level, scientists can predict the lake level fluctuation onward for 5\u20138 years. The Utah Climate Center provides prediction of the Great Salt Lake's annual lake level. This forecast uses central tropical Pacific Ocean temperature, watershed precipitation, tree-ring data of 750+ years, and the lake level itself.\nA railroad line\u00a0\u2013 the Lucin Cutoff\u00a0\u2013 runs across the lake, crossing the southern end of Promontory Peninsula. The mostly solid causeway supporting the railway divides the lake into three portions: the north-east arm, north-west arm, and southern. The causeway obstructed the normal mixing of the waters of the lake, because there were only three breaches. Because no rivers, except a few minor streams, flow directly into the north-west arm, Gunnison Bay, it is substantially saltier than the rest of the lake. This saltier environment promotes different types of algae from those growing in the southern part of the lake, leading to a marked color difference on the two sides of the causeway. On December 1, 2016, the opening of a new bridge allowed water to flow from the southern arm of the lake into the north-west arm. At the time of opening of the causeway, the north-west arm was nearly lower than the southern arm. By April 2017, the levels of both arms of the lake had risen due to spring runoff, and the north-western arm was within of the southern arm.\nIslands.\nCategorically stating the number of islands is difficult, as the method used to determine what is an island is not necessarily the same in each source. Since the water level of the lake can vary greatly between years, what may be considered an island in a high water year may be considered a peninsula in another, or an island in a low water year may be covered during another year. According to the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey, \"there are eight named islands in the lake that have never been totally submerged during historic time. All have been connected to the mainland by exposed shoals during periods of low water.\" In addition to these eight islands, the lake also contains a number of rocks, reefs, or shoals that become fully or partially submerged at high water levels.\nThe Utah Geological Survey states \"the lake contains 11 recognized islands, although this number varies depending on the level of the lake. Seven islands are in the southern portion of the lake and four in the northwestern portion.\"\nThe size and whether they are counted as islands during any particular year depends mostly on the level of the lake. From largest to smallest, they are Antelope Island, Stansbury Island, Fremont Island, Carrington Island, Dolphin Island, Cub Island, and Badger Island, and various named rocks, reefs, or shoals such as Strongs Knob, Gunnison Island, Goose, Browns, Hat (Bird), Egg Island, Black Rock, and White Rock. Dolphin Island, Cub Island, and Strongs Knob are in the northwestern arm. The rest are in the southern portion of the Great Salt Lake.\nBlack Rock, Antelope Island, White Rock, Egg Island, Fremont Island, and the Promontory mountain range are each extensions of the Oquirrh Mountain Range, which dips beneath the lake at its southeastern shore. Stansbury, Carrington, and Hat Islands are extensions of the Stansbury mountain range, and Strongs Knob is an extension of the Lakeside Mountains which run along the lake's western shore. The lake is deepest in the area between these island chains, measured by Howard Stansbury in 1850 at about deep, and an average depth of 13 feet (four meters). When the water levels are low, Antelope Island becomes connected to the shore as a peninsula, as do Goose Islands, Browns Island, and some of the other islands. Stansbury Island and Strongs Knob remain peninsulas unless the water level rises well-above the average.\nLake-effect precipitation.\nDue to the warm waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake-effect snowfalls are frequent phenomena in the surrounding area. Cold north, north-west, or west winds generally blow across the lake following the passage of a cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest in Tooele County to the east, and north into central Davis County, and can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally within a narrow band which is highly-dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.\nThe lake-effect snowfalls are more likely to occur in late fall, early winter and spring, due to the larger temperature differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City can be attributed to the lake effect.\nHydrology.\nBecause of its high salt concentration, the lake water is unusually dense, and most people can float more easily than in other bodies of water, particularly in Gunnison Bay, the saltier north arm of the lake.\nWater levels have been recorded since 1875, averaging about above sea level. Since the Great Salt Lake is a shallow lake with gently sloping shores around all edges except on the south side, small variations in the water level greatly affect the extent of the shoreline. The water level can rise dramatically in wet years and fall during dry years. The water level is also affected by the amount of water flow diverted for agricultural and urban uses. The Jordan and Weber rivers, in particular, are diverted for other uses. In the 1880s, Grove Karl Gilbert predicted that the lake\u00a0\u2013 then in the middle of many years of recession\u00a0\u2013 would virtually disappear except for a small remnant between the islands.\nA 2014 study used tree rings collected in the watershed of the Great Salt Lake to create reconstruction. The lake level change is strongly modulated by Pacific Ocean-coupled ocean/atmospheric oscillations at low frequency and therefore reflects the decadal-scale wet/dry cycles that characterize the region. By capturing these climate oscillations as well as utilizing the tree-ring reconstruction of lake level change, researchers were able to predict the lake level fluctuation onward for as long as 5\u20138 years.\nThe Great Salt Lake differs in elevation between the south and north parts. The causeway for the Lucin Cutoff divides the lake into two parts. The water-surface elevation of the south part of the lake is usually higher than that of the north part because most of the inflow to the lake occurs from the south.\nSalinity.\nMost of the salts dissolved in the lake and deposited in the desert flats around it reflect the concentration of solutes by evaporation; Lake Bonneville itself was fresh enough to support populations of fish. More salt is added yearly via rivers and streams, though the amount is much less than the relict salt from Bonneville.\nThe salinity of the lake's main basin, Gilbert Bay, is highly variable and depends on the lake's level; it ranges from 5 to 27% (50 to 270 parts per thousand). For comparison, the average salinity of the world ocean is 3.5% (35 parts per thousand) and that of the Dead Sea is 33.7%. The ionic composition is similar to seawater, much more so than the Dead Sea's water; compared to the ocean, the Great Salt Lake's waters are slightly enriched in potassium and depleted in calcium. Dissolved ions do not necessarily increase or decrease in step with changes of total dissolved solids. For example, in October 1903, dissolved solids tallied 27.72% and by February 1910 they were down to 17.68%, with chlorine, sodium and sulfate levels substantially lower, but over the same time calcium, magnesium and potassium \"increased\", with the increase of magnesium especially pronounced.\nEcosystem.\nThe high salinity in parts of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, nematodes, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.\nThere are twenty-seven private duck clubs, seven state waterfowl management areas, and a large federal bird refuge on the Great Salt Lake's shores. Wetland/wildlife management areas include the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge; Gillmor Sanctuary; Great Salt Lake Shore lands Preserve; Salt Creek, Public Shooting Grounds, Harold Crane, Locomotive Springs, Ogden Bay, Timpie Springs, and Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Areas.\nSeveral islands in the lake provide critical nesting areas for various birds. Access to Hat, Gunnison, and Cub islands is strictly limited by the State of Utah in an effort to protect nesting colonies of American white pelican \"(Pelecanus erythrorhynchos).\" The islands within the Great Salt Lake also provide habitat for lizard and mammalian wildlife and a variety of plant species. Some species may have been extirpated from the islands. For example, a number of explorers who visited the area in the mid-1800s (e.g. Emmanuel Domenech, Howard Stansbury, Jules R\u00e9my) noted an abundance of yellow-flowered \"onions\" on several of the islands, which they identified as \"Calochortus luteus\". This species today occurs only in California; however, at that time the name \"C. luteus\" was applied to plants that later were named \"C. nuttallii\" A yellow-flowered \"Calochortus\" was first named as a variety of \"C. nuttallii\" but was later separated into a new species, \"C. aureus\". This species occurs in Utah today, though apparently no longer on the islands of the Great Salt Lake.\nBecause of the Great Salt Lake's high salinity, it has few fish, but they do occur in Bear River Bay and Farmington Bay when spring runoff brings fresh water into the lake. A few aquatic animals live in the lake's main basin, including centimeter-long brine shrimp \"(Artemia franciscana).\" Their tiny, hard-walled eggs or cysts (diameter about 200 micrometers) are harvested in quantity during the fall and early winter. They are fed to prawns in Asia, sold as novelty \"Sea-Monkeys,\" sold either live, frozen, or dehydrated in pet stores as a fish food, and used in testing of toxins, drugs, and other chemicals. There are also two species of brine fly, as well as protozoa, rotifers, bacteria and algae.\nSalinity differences between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by \"Dunaliella salina\", a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color. The dense, high-salinity water of the North Arm flows back through the causeway into the Southern portion of the lake, creating a deep brine layer there.\nAlthough brine shrimp can be found in the arm of the lake north of the causeway, studies conducted by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources indicate that these are likely transient. Populations of brine shrimp are mostly restricted to the lake's south arm.\nIn the two bays that receive most of the lake's freshwater inflows, Bear River Bay and Farmington Bay, the diversity of organisms is much higher. Salinities in these bays can approach that of fresh water when the spring snow melt occurs, and this allows a variety of bacteria, algae and invertebrates to proliferate in the nutrient-rich water. The abundance of invertebrates such as gnat larvae (chironomids) and back swimmers (Trichocorixa) are fed upon extensively by the huge shorebird and waterfowl populations that utilize the lake. Fish in these bays are fed upon by diving terns and pelicans.\nPink Floyd the flamingo.\nA solitary Chilean flamingo, named Pink Floyd after the English rock band, wintered at the Great Salt Lake. He escaped from Salt Lake City's Tracy Aviary in 1987 and lived in the wild, eating brine shrimp and socializing with gulls and swans. A group of Utah residents suggested petitioning the state to release more flamingos in an effort to keep Floyd company and as a possible tourist attraction. Pink Floyd was last seen in Idaho, in the area of Camas National Wildlife Refuge in 2005.\nElevated mercury levels.\nDuring a survey in the mid-1990s, U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service researchers discovered a high level of methylmercury in the Great Salt Lake with 25 nanograms per liter of water. For comparison, a fish consumption advisory was issued at the Florida Everglades after water there was found to contain 1 nanogram per liter. The extremely high methylmercury concentrations have been only in the lake's anoxic deep brine layer (monimolimnion) below a depth of , but concentrations are also moderately high up in the water column where there is oxygen to support brine shrimp and brine flies.\nThe toxic metal shows up throughout the lake's food chain, from brine shrimp to eared grebes and cinnamon teal.\nThe finding of high mercury levels prompted further studies, and a health advisory warning hunters not to eat common goldeneye or northern shoveler, two species of duck found in the lake. It has been stated that this does not pose a risk to other recreational users of the lake.\nAfter later studies were conducted with a larger number of birds, the advisories were revised and another was added for cinnamon teal. Seven other species of duck were studied and found to have levels of mercury below EPA guidelines, thus being determined safe to eat.\nA study in 2010 suggested that the main source of the mercury is from atmospheric deposition from worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16% of the mercury is from rivers, and 84% is from the atmosphere as an inorganic form, which is converted into more toxic methylmercury by bacteria which thrive in the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway. A 2020 study found high concentrations of mercury in the lake's sediments, a consequence from smelting and mining activities in the surrounding mountains. The mercury and other metals can contaminate the overlying water, and in turn, move into brine shrimp and other organisms.\nCommerce.\nGreat Salt Lake contributes an estimated $1.3\u00a0billion annually to Utah's economy, including $1.1\u00a0billion from industry (primarily mineral extraction), $136\u00a0million from recreation, and $57\u00a0million from the harvest of brine shrimp.\nBrine shrimp.\nThe harvest of brine shrimp cysts during fall and early winter has developed into a significant local industry, with the lake providing 35% to 45% of the worldwide supply of brine shrimp, and cysts selling for as high as . Brine shrimp were first harvested during the 1950s and sold as commercial fish food. In the 1970s, the focus changed to their eggs, known as cysts, which were sold primarily outside the US as food for shrimp, prawns, and some fish. Today, these are mostly sold in East Asia and South America. The amount of cysts and the quality are affected by several factors, but salinity is most important. The cysts will hatch at 2 to 3% salinity, but the greatest productivity is at salinities above about 10%. If the salinity drops near 5% to 6%, the cysts will lose buoyancy and sink, making them more difficult to harvest.\nThe causeway across the lake was built in the 1950s as a replacement to a wooden trestle. Prior to December 2, 2016, the causeway constrained the flow of water between northern and southern arms, which has a significant impact on various industries surrounding the lake. The construction of a bridge created an opening of the causeway for water to flow between the arms of the lake.\nThe northern arm of the lake has a much higher salinity, to the point that the native brine shrimp cannot survive in its waters. In the southern portion of the lake, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine shrimp to survive. With the opening of the bridge, the salinity of the northern arm of the lake will likely drop as less saline water from the southern arm of the lake flows into the northern arm. The brine shrimp harvesting industry could benefit from the freer flow of water. There were concerns from the brine shrimp harvesting industry that the conditions in the southern arm of the lake were becoming too saline for the brine shrimp, following several years of lower precipitation in the lake's watershed. The precipitation in the watershed was above normal for the water year beginning on October 1, 2016. The additional water allowed the levels of both arms of the lake to rise, creating better conditions for a healthy brine shrimp population.\nOil and minerals.\nThe Great Salt Lake contains an estimated 410,000 metric tons of lithium, 91,000,000 metric tons of magnesium, and 57,000,000 metric tons of potassium since 2011.\nGreat Salt Lake Minerals Company (a subsidiary of Compass Minerals) extracts minerals from the northern bay. The company potentially benefited from the higher salinity of the north-west arm of the lake but had difficulty accessing water from the lake because of lower water level. Prior to the opening of the causeway, the intake channels had to be extended to reach the water.\nMorton Salt, Cargill Salt, Broken Arrow Salt and the Renco Group's U.S. Magnesium each extract minerals from the southern bay and could benefit from a more natural mixture of water between the two sides of the lake. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14% of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Additionally a company called Lilac Solutions has just completed a successful pilot operation to begin extracting Lithium using ion-exchange technologies. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.\nSolar evaporation ponds at the edges of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant.\nThe lake's north arm contains deposits of oil, but it is of poor quality and it is not economically feasible to extract and purify it. As of 1993, approximately of crude oil had been produced from shallow wells along the shore. The oil field at Rozel Point produced an estimated of oil from 30 to 50 wells, but has been inactive since the mid-1980s. Oil seeps in the area had been known since the late 19th century, and attempts at production began in 1904. Industrial debris from this field remained in place near \"Spiral Jetty\" until a cleanup effort by the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining and the Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands was completed in December 2005.\nRecreation.\nThe lake is one of Utah's largest tourist attractions. Antelope Island State Park is a popular tourist destination that offers panoramic views of the lake, hiking and biking trails, wildlife viewing and access to beaches.\nThe State of Utah operates a marina on the south shore of the lake at Great Salt Lake State Park and another in Antelope Island State Park. With its sudden storms and expansive spread, the lake is a great test of sailing\nskills. Single-mast simple sloops are the most popular boats. Sudden storms and lack of experience on the part of boaters are the two most dangerous elements in boating and sailing on the Great Salt Lake.\nDramatically fluctuating lake levels have inhibited the creation and success of tourist-related developments. There is also a problem with pollution from industrial and urban effluent, as well as a natural \"lake stink\" caused by the decay of insects and other wildlife, particularly when the shallow water is disturbed.\nSaltair.\nThree resorts have operated under the name Saltair on the southern shore of the lake since 1893. Rising and lowering water levels have affected each iteration.\nThe first Saltair pavilion was destroyed by fire on April 22, 1925. A new pavilion was built and the resort was expanded at the same location by new investors, but after being closed for several years, it was destroyed by arson in 1970. The second Saltair included a fun house and a dancing venue.\nThe current Saltair serves as a concert venue. The new resort was completed in 1981, approximately a mile (1600 m) west of the original.\nGarfield Beach Resort.\nThe Garfield Beach Resort was established by Captain Thomas Douris in 1881 and was originally called Garfield Landing. The resort was located near Black Rock outside of the town of Corinne, and patrons traveled to it via the steamboat \"General Garfield\". After the expansion of the resort, the \"General Garfield\" was replaced by two steamers, the \"Susie Riter\" and the \"Whirlwind\". The iconic \"General Garfield\" was moored to the dock as a landmark. The main attraction of the resort was a massive pavilion 400 feet from shore. It covered and included of covered deck. The success of Garfield Beach eventually overtook the neighboring Black Rock resort. In 1887, the resort was purchased by the Utah and Nevada railroad. They improved the site by adding an array of bathhouses, a restaurant, and other amenities, including a bowling alley. The resort was the Salt Lake's first to have an electric generator, which powered its many concerts, and parties held atop the pavilion tower. Garfield Beach was the most popular Salt Lake resort until Saltair was built in 1893. The resort was put out of service by a fire in 1904.\nArts and culture.\nSpiral Jetty.\nThe northwest arm of the lake, near Rozel Point, is the location for Robert Smithson's work of land art, \"Spiral Jetty\" (1970), which is only visible when the level of Great Salt Lake drops below above sea level.\nOolitic sand.\nThe lake and its shores contain oolitic sand, small, rounded, or spherical grains of sand that are made up of a nucleus (generally a small mineral grain) and concentric layers of calcium carbonate and look similar to very small pearls.\nLegends, mysteries and folklore.\nWhales in the Great Salt Lake.\nThe myth of Whales in the Great Salt Lake is a 19th-century Utah folklore story, originally reported in 1888, that has been debunked as a hoax. The story claimed that British scientist James Wickham introduced whales into the Great Salt Lake in 1875.\nLake monster.\nIn mid-1877, J. H. McNeil was with many other Barnes and Co. Salt Works employees on the lake's north shore in the evening. They claimed to have seen a large monster with a body like a crocodile and a horse's head in the lake. They claimed this monster attacked the men, who quickly ran away and hid until morning. This creature is regarded by some to have simply been a buffalo in the lake. Thirty years prior, \"Brother Bainbridge\" claimed to have sighted a creature that looked like a dolphin in the lake near Antelope Island.\nWater babies.\nThe \"Water Babies\" are a part of Native American folklore associated with the Great Salt Lake. According to these stories, the cries of infants can be heard near the lake, luring people toward the water. Once someone approaches, they are said to be dragged into the depths by the \"Water Babies,\" never to return.\nSaltair Sally.\nSaltair, the historic resort on the shores of the\nGreat Salt Lake has purported tales of paranormal activity. The most infamous of these is the story of \"Saltair Sally.\" In the fall of 2000, duck hunters discovered the partially decomposed remains of a woman near the Saltair area. Initially unidentified, she was referred to as \"Saltair Sally\" by locals. In 2012, DNA testing identified her as Nikole Bakoles, a 20-year-old mother and homicide victim. The unresolved circumstances surrounding her death have led to local legends suggesting that her spirit haunts the area, with reports of ghostly sightings and unexplained voices.\nThe Case of Jean Baptiste.\nIn 1862, Jean Baptiste, a grave robber in Salt Lake City, was discovered to have robbed nearly 300 graves. Public outrage led to his exile on Fremont Island, but he disappeared, and his fate remains a mystery. Some speculate he was seen in Montana, but no evidence confirms his whereabouts.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most commonly associated with horror, action, and science fiction films of the 1970s and 1980s, he is generally recognized as a master of the horror genre. At the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, the French Directors' Guild gave him the Golden Coach Award and lauded him as \"a creative genius of raw, fantastic, and spectacular emotions\". On April 3, 2025, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nCarpenter's early films included critical and commercial successes such as \"Halloween\" (1978), \"The Fog\" (1980), \"Escape from New York\" (1981), and \"Starman\" (1984). Though he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker, his other productions from the 1970s and the 1980s only later came to be considered cult classics; these include \"Dark Star\" (1974), \"Assault on Precinct 13\" (1976), \"The Thing\" (1982), \"Christine\" (1983), \"Big Trouble in Little China\" (1986), \"Prince of Darkness\" (1987), \"They Live\" (1988), \"In the Mouth of Madness\" (1994), and \"Escape from L.A.\" (1996). He returned to the \"Halloween\" franchise as a composer and executive producer on \"Halloween\" (2018), \"Halloween Kills\" (2021), and \"Halloween Ends\" (2022).\nCarpenter usually composes or co-composes the music in his films. He won a Saturn Award for Best Music for the soundtrack of \"Vampires\" (1998) and has released five studio albums: \"Lost Themes\" (2015), \"Lost Themes II\" (2016), ' (2017), ' (2021), and \"Lost Themes IV: Noir\" (2024). He also produces horror, science fiction, and children's comics through Storm King Comics, the publisher founded by his wife, Sandy King, in 2013.\nEarly life.\nJohn Howard Carpenter was born in Carthage, New York, on January 16, 1948, the son of Milton Jean (n\u00e9e Carter) and music professor Howard Ralph Carpenter. In 1953, after his father accepted a job at Western Kentucky University, the family relocated to Bowling Green, Kentucky. For much of his childhood, he and his family lived in a log cabin on the university's campus. He was interested in films from an early age, particularly the westerns of Howard Hawks and John Ford, as well as 1950s low-budget horror films such as \"The Thing from Another World\" (which he would remake as \"The Thing\" in 1982) and high-budget sci-fi like \"Godzilla\" and \"Forbidden Planet\".\nCarpenter began making short horror films with an 8 mm camera before he had even started high school. Just before he turned 14 in 1962, he made a few major short films: \"Godzilla vs. Gorgo\", featuring Godzilla and Gorgo via claymation, and the sci-fi western \"Terror from Space\", starring the one-eyed creature from \"It Came from Outer Space\". He graduated from College High School, then enrolled at Western Kentucky University for two years as an English major and History minor. With a desire to study filmmaking, which no university in Kentucky offered at the time, he moved to California upon transferring to the USC School of Cinematic Arts in 1968. He would ultimately drop out of school in his final semester in order to make his first feature film.\nCareer.\nEarly career: 1960s - 1970s.\nIn a beginning film course at USC Cinema during 1969, Carpenter wrote and directed an eight-minute short film, \"Captain Voyeur\". The film was rediscovered in the USC archives in 2011 and proved interesting because it revealed elements that would appear in his later film, \"Halloween\" (1978).\nThe next year he collaborated with producer John Longenecker as co-writer, film editor, and music composer for \"The Resurrection of Broncho Billy\" (1970), which won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. The short film was enlarged to 35 mm, sixty prints were made, and the film was released theatrically by Universal Studios for two years in the United States and Canada.\nCarpenter's first major film as director, \"Dark Star\" (1974), was a science-fiction comedy that he co-wrote with Dan O'Bannon (who later went on to write \"Alien\", borrowing freely from much of \"Dark Star\"). The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing, and directing, while O'Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of George Lucas who hired him to work with the special effects for the film \"Star Wars\"). Carpenter received praise for his ability to make low-budget films.\nCarpenter's next film was \"Assault on Precinct 13\" (1976), a low-budget thriller influenced by the films of Howard Hawks, particularly \"Rio Bravo\". As with \"Dark Star\", Carpenter was responsible for many aspects of the film's creation. He not only wrote, directed, and scored it, but also edited the film using the pseudonym \"John T. Chance\" (the name of John Wayne's character in \"Rio Bravo\"). Carpenter has said that he considers \"Assault on Precinct 13\" to have been his first real film because it was the first film that he filmed on a schedule. The film was the first time Carpenter worked with Debra Hill, who would collaborate with Carpenter on some of his most well-known films.\nCarpenter assembled a main cast that consisted of experienced but relatively obscure actors. The two main actors were Austin Stoker, who had appeared previously in science fiction, disaster, and blaxploitation films, and Darwin Joston, who had worked primarily for television and had once been Carpenter's next-door neighbor.\nThe film received a critical reassessment in the United States, where it is now generally regarded as one of the best exploitation films of the 1970s.\nCarpenter both wrote and directed the Lauren Hutton thriller \"Someone's Watching Me!\". This television film is the tale of a single, working woman who, soon after arriving in L.A., discovers that she is being stalked.\n\"Eyes of Laura Mars\", a 1978 thriller featuring Faye Dunaway and Tommy Lee Jones and directed by Irvin Kershner, was adapted (in collaboration with David Zelag Goodman) from a spec script titled \"Eyes\", written by Carpenter, and would become Carpenter's first major studio film of his career.\n\"Halloween\" (1978) was a commercial success and helped develop the slasher genre. Originally an idea suggested by producer Irwin Yablans (titled \"The Babysitter Murders\"), who thought of a film about babysitters being menaced by a stalker, Carpenter took the idea and another suggestion from Yablans that it occur during Halloween and developed a story. Carpenter said of the basic concept: \"Halloween night. It has never been the theme in a film. My idea was to do an old haunted house film.\"\nFilm director Bob Clark suggested in an interview released in 2005 that Carpenter had asked him for his own ideas for a sequel to his 1974 film \"Black Christmas\" (written by Roy Moore) that featured an unseen and motiveless killer murdering students in a university sorority house. As also stated in the 2009 documentary \"Clarkworld\" (written and directed by Clark's former production designer Deren Abram after Clark's tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in \" Black Christmas\": \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...I did a film about three years later, started a film with John Carpenter, it was his first film for Warner Bros. (which picked up 'Black Christmas'), he asked me if I was ever gonna do a sequel, and I said no. I was through with horror, I didn't come into the business to do just horror. He said, \"Well, what would you do if you did do a sequel?\" I said it would be the next year, and the guy would have actually been caught, escape from a mental institution, go back to the house, and they would start all over again. And I would call it 'Halloween'. The truth is John didn't copy 'Black Christmas', he wrote a script, directed the script, did the casting. 'Halloween' is his movie, and besides, the script came to him already titled anyway. He liked 'Black Christmas' and may have been influenced by it, but John Carpenter did not copy the idea. Fifteen other people had thought to do a movie called 'Halloween,' but the script came to John with that title on it.\u2014\u200a \nThe film was written by Carpenter and Debra Hill with Carpenter stating that the music was inspired by both Dario Argento's \"Suspiria\" (which also influenced the film's slightly surreal color scheme) and William Friedkin's \"The Exorcist\".\nCarpenter again worked with a relatively small budget, $300,000. The budget was so small the actors provided their own costumes. The film grossed more than $65 million initially, making it one of the most successful independent films of all time.\nCarpenter has described \"Halloween\" as \"true crass exploitation. I decided to make a film I would love to have seen as a kid, full of cheap tricks like a haunted house at a fair where you walk down the corridor and things jump out at you\". The film has often been cited as an allegory on the virtue of sexual purity and the danger of casual sex, although Carpenter has explained that this was not his intent: \"It has been suggested that I was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I'm not. In \"Halloween\", I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers.\"\nIn addition to the film's critical and commercial success, Carpenter's self-composed \"Halloween Theme\" became recognizable apart from the film.\nIn 1979, Carpenter began what was to be the first of several collaborations with actor Kurt Russell when he directed the television film \"Elvis\".\nCommercial successes: 1980s.\nCarpenter followed up the success of \"Halloween\" with \"The Fog\" (1980), a ghostly revenge tale (co-written by Hill) inspired by horror comics such as \"Tales from the Crypt\" and by \"The Crawling Eye\", a 1958 film about monsters hiding in clouds.\nCompleting \"The Fog\" was an unusually difficult process for Carpenter. After viewing a rough cut of the film, he was dissatisfied with the result. For the only time in his filmmaking career, Carpenter had to devise a way to salvage a nearly finished film that did not meet his standards. In order to make the film more coherent and frightening, Carpenter filmed additional footage that included new scenes.\nDespite production problems and mostly negative critical reception, \"The Fog\" was another commercial success for Carpenter. The film was made on a budget of $1,000,000, but it grossed over $21,000,000 in the United States alone. Carpenter has said that \"The Fog\" is not his favorite film, although he considers it a \"minor horror classic\".\nCarpenter immediately followed \"The Fog\" with the science-fiction adventure \"Escape from New York\" (1981). Featuring several actors that Carpenter had collaborated with (Kurt Russell, Donald Pleasence, Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Charles Cyphers, and Frank Doubleday) or would collaborate with again (Harry Dean Stanton), and other actors (Lee Van Cleef and Ernest Borgnine), it became both commercially successful (grossing more than $25 million) and critically acclaimed (with an 85% on Rotten Tomatoes).\nHis next film, \"The Thing\" (1982), has high production values, including innovative special effects by Rob Bottin, special visual effects by matte artist Albert Whitlock, a score by Ennio Morricone and a cast including Russell and respected character actors such as Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Keith David, and Richard Masur. \"The Thing\" was distributed by Universal Pictures. Although Carpenter's film used the same source material as the 1951 Howard Hawks film, \"The Thing from Another World\", it is more faithful to the John W. Campbell Jr. novella \"Who Goes There?\", upon which both films were based. Moreover, unlike the Hawks film, \"The Thing\" was part of what Carpenter later called his \"Apocalypse Trilogy\", a trio of films (\"The Thing\", \"Prince of Darkness\", and \"In the Mouth of Madness\") with bleak endings for the film's characters.\n\"The Thing\" is a graphic, sinister horror film; in a 1999 interview, Carpenter said audiences rejected it for its nihilistic, depressing viewpoint at a time when the United States was in the midst of a recession. When it opened, it was competing against the critically and commercially successful \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" ($619million), a family-friendly film released two weeks earlier that offered a more optimistic take on alien visitation.\nThe impact on Carpenter was immediate\u00a0\u2013 he lost the job of directing the 1984 science fiction horror film \"Firestarter\" because of \"The Thing\"'s poor performance. His previous success had gained him a multiple-film contract at Universal, but the studio opted to buy him out of it instead. He continued making films afterward but lost confidence, and did not openly talk about \"The Thing\"'s failure until a 1985 interview with \"Starlog\", where he said, \"I was called 'a pornographer of violence'... I had no idea it would be received that way... \"The Thing\" was just too strong for that time. I knew it was going to be strong, but I didn't think it would be too strong... I didn't take the public's taste into consideration.\"\nWhile \"The Thing\" was not initially successful, it was able to find new audiences and appreciation on home video, and later on television.\nIn the years following its release, critics and fans have reevaluated \"The Thing\" as a milestone of the horror genre. A prescient review by Peter Nicholls in 1992, called \"The Thing\" \"a black, memorable film [that] may yet be seen as a classic\". It has been called one of the best films directed by Carpenter. John Kenneth Muir called it \"Carpenter's most accomplished and underrated directorial effort\", and critic Matt Zoller Seitz said it \"is one of the greatest and most elegantly constructed B-movies ever made\".Trace Thurman described it as one of the best films ever, and in 2008, \"Empire\" magazine selected it as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, at number 289, calling it \"a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina-wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror\". It is now considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made.\nCarpenter's next film, \"Christine\", was the 1983 adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name. The story concerns a high-school nerd named Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who buys a junked 1958 Plymouth Fury which turns out to have supernatural powers. As Cunningham restores and rebuilds the car, he becomes unnaturally obsessed with it, with deadly consequences. \"Christine\" did respectable business upon its release and was received well by critics. He said he directed it because it was the only thing offered to him at the time.\n\"Starman\" (1984) was produced by Michael Douglas; the script was well received by Columbia Pictures, which chose it in preference to the script for \"E.T.\" and prompted Steven Spielberg to go to Universal Pictures. Douglas chose Carpenter to be the director because of his reputation as an action director who could also convey strong emotion. \"Starman\" was reviewed favorably by the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"New York Times\", and \"LA Weekly\", and described by Carpenter as a film he envisioned as a romantic comedy similar to \"It Happened One Night\" only with a space alien. The film received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Jeff Bridges' portrayal of Starman and received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Musical Score for Jack Nitzsche.\nAfter the commercial disappointment of action\u2013comedy \"Big Trouble in Little China\" (1986), Carpenter struggled to secure high-profile film offers and resumed making lower budget films such as \"Prince of Darkness\" (1987). Some of these films, including \"They Live\" (1988), later developed cult followings, but Carpenter did not regain the same level of mainstream industry attention.\nLater career: 1990s - 2000s.\nCarpenter's 1990s films, including \"Memoirs of an Invisible Man\" (1992) and \"Village of the Damned\" (1995), did not achieve the same initial commercial success of his earlier work. Carpenter made \"Body Bags\", a television horror anthology film in collaboration with Tobe Hooper and \"In the Mouth of Madness\" (1995), a Lovecraftian homage that was not successful commercially or with critics, but now has a cult following. \"Escape from L.A.\" (1996), the sequel of the cult classic \"Escape from New York\", received mixed reviews but has also gained a cult following since its release. \"Vampires\" (1998) featured James Woods as the leader of a band of vampire hunters in league with the Catholic Church.\nIn 1998, Carpenter composed the soundtrack (titled \"Earth/Air\") for the video game \"Sentinel Returns\", published for PC and PlayStation.\nIn 2001, his film \"Ghosts of Mars\" was released but was not successful. During 2005, there were remakes of \"Assault on Precinct 13\" and \"The Fog\", the latter being produced by Carpenter himself, though in an interview he defined his involvement as, \"I come in and say hello to everybody. Go home.\"\nCarpenter served as director for a 2005 episode of Showtime's \"Masters of Horror\" television series, one of the 13 filmmakers involved in the first season. His episode, \"Cigarette Burns\", received generally positive reviews from critics and praise from Carpenter's fans. He later directed another original episode for the show's second season in 2006 titled \"Pro-Life\".\n2010s: \"The Ward\", focus on music and return to \"Halloween\".\n\"The Ward\", Carpenter's first film since \"Ghosts of Mars\", premiered at Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2010, before a limited release in the United States in July 2011. It received generally poor reviews from critics and grossed only $5.3 million worldwide against an estimated $10 million budget. As of 2025, it is the most recent film he directed.\nCarpenter narrated the video game \"F.E.A.R. 3\", while also consulting on its storyline. On October 10, 2010, Carpenter received the Lifetime Award from the Freak Show Horror Film Festival.\nOn February 3, 2015, the indie label Sacred Bones Records released his album \"Lost Themes\". On October 19, 2015, All Tomorrow's Parties announced that Carpenter will be performing old and new compositions in London and Manchester, England. In February 2016, Carpenter announced a sequel to \"Lost Themes\" titled \"Lost Themes II\", which was released on April 15 that year. He released his third studio album, titled \"\", on October 20, 2017.\nCarpenter returned, as executive producer, co-composer, and creative consultant, on the 11th entry of the \"Halloween\" film series, titled \"Halloween\", released in October 2018. The film is a direct sequel to Carpenter's original film, breaking the continuity of earlier sequels. It was his first direct involvement with the franchise since 1982's \"\".\n2020s: \"Halloween\" sequels, \"Toxic Commando\", \"Suburban Screams\", and Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nCarpenter worked as a composer and executive producer on the 2021 sequel \"Halloween Kills\" and 2022's follow-up \"Halloween Ends\".\nDuring Summer Game Fest in June 2023, it was announced that Carpenter was collaborating with Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive on the zombie first-person shooter video game \"Toxic Commando\". The game is scheduled to be released in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows via Steam and the Epic Games Store. Carpenter worked on the game's story and also composed its musical score.\nIn October 2023, he directed an episode of the Peacock streaming series \"Suburban Screams\" while also composing the series theme music and serving as an executive producer.\nOn December 8, 2024, Carpenter received a Career Achievement Award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. On April 3, 2025, Carpenter received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nIn October 2025, Carpenter served as an executive producer on the horror anthology series \"John Carpenter Presents\".\nStyle and influences.\nCarpenter's films are characterized by minimalist lighting and photography, panoramic shots, use of steadicam, and scores he usually composes himself. With a few exceptions, he has scored all of his films (some of which he co-scored), most famously the themes from \"Halloween\" and \"Assault on Precinct 13\". His music is generally synthesized with accompaniment from piano and atmospherics.\nCarpenter is known for his widescreen shot compositions and is an outspoken proponent of Panavision anamorphic cinematography. With some exceptions, all of his films were shot in Panavision anamorphic format with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, generally favoring wider focal lengths. \"The Ward\" was filmed in Super 35, the first time Carpenter has ever used that system. He has stated that he feels the 35 mm Panavision anamorphic format is \"the best movie system there is\" and prefers it to both digital and 3D.\nFilm music and solo records.\nIn a 2016 interview, Carpenter stated that it was his father's work as a music teacher that first sparked an interest in him to make music. This interest was to play a major role in his later career: he composed the music to most of his films, and the soundtrack to many of those became \"cult\" items for record collectors. A 21st-Century revival of his music is due in no small amount to the Death Waltz record company, which reissued several of his soundtracks, including \"Escape from New York\", \"Halloween II\", \"\", \"Assault on Precinct 13\", \"They Live\", \"Prince of Darkness\", and \"The Fog\".\nCarpenter was an early adopter of synthesizers, since his film debut \"Dark Star\", when he used an EMS VCS3 synth. His soundtracks went on to influence electronic artists who followed, but Carpenter himself admitted he had no particular interest in synthesizers other than that they provided a means to \"sound big with just a keyboard\". For many years he worked in partnership with musician Alan Howarth, who would realize his vision by working on the more technical aspects of recording, allowing Carpenter to focus on writing the music.\nThe renewed interest in John Carpenter's music thanks to the Death Waltz reissues and \"Lost Themes\" albums prompted him to, for the first time ever, tour as a musician. As of 2016[ [update]], Carpenter was more focused on his music career than filmmaking, although he was involved in 2018's \"Halloween\" reboot, and its sequels.\nCarpenter narrates the documentary film \"The Rise of the Synths\", which explores the origins and growth of the synthwave genre, and features numerous interviews with synthwave artists who cite him and other electronic pioneers such as Vangelis, Giorgio Moroder and Tangerine Dream as significant influences. The retro-1980s synthwave band Gunship are featured in the film; Carpenter narrated the opening to their track entitled \"Tech Noir\".\nCarpenter is featured on the track \"Destructive Field\" on his godson Daniel Davies' album \"Signals\", released February 28, 2020.\nHis third solo album ' was launched on February 2, 2021. A new (digital) single was released on October 27, 2020, titled \"Weeping Ghost\", followed in December 2020 by another new track from the forthcoming album, titled \"The Dead Walk\". Two tracks that also appear on the album, \"Skeleton\" and \"Unclear Spirit\", were released in July 2020. On the album, Carpenter collaborated again with his son Cody and his godson Daniel Davies. In August 2023, a fifth collaboration with Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies was announced for Sacred Bones Records, titled ', and was released on October 6, 2023.\nA fourth \"Lost Themes\" album was announced in March 2024, subtitled \"Noir\". It was again recorded in collaboration with Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies. It was released on May 3 on Sacred Bones Records. The album was preceded by the single and official video \"My Name is Death\".\nPersonal life.\nCarpenter met actress Adrienne Barbeau on the set of his television film \"Someone's Watching Me!\" (1978). They married on January 1, 1979, and divorced in 1984. During their marriage, she appeared in his films \"The Fog\" and \"Escape from New York\". They have one son, Cody Carpenter (born May 7, 1984), who became a musician and composer. Cody's godfather is English-American musician Daniel Davies, whose own godfather is Carpenter.\nCarpenter married film producer Sandy King in 1990. She produced his films \"In the Mouth of Madness\", \"Village of the Damned\", \"Vampires\", and \"Ghosts of Mars\". She was earlier the script supervisor for \"Starman\", \"Big Trouble in Little China\", \"Prince of Darkness\", and \"They Live\", as well as an associate producer of the latter. She co-created (with Thomas Ian Griffith) the comic book series \"Asylum\", with which Carpenter is involved.\nIn an episode of Animal Planet's \"Animal Icons\" titled \"It Came from Japan\", Carpenter discussed his admiration for the original \"Godzilla\" film. He also appreciates video games as art, and particularly likes the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" games \"Sonic Unleashed\" and \"Sonic Mania\", as well as the \"F.E.A.R.\" series. He offered to narrate and help direct the cinematics for \"F.E.A.R. 3\", ultimately serving as the game's narrator and consulting on its storyline. He has also praised video games such as \"\" and \"Fallout 76\". He has also expressed an interest in making a film based on \"Dead Space\".\nCarpenter has called his political views \"inconsistent\" and has said that he is against authority figures while also in favor of big government, admitting that this set of views \"doesn't make any sense\". When asked if he considered himself a libertarian-liberal, he simply responded \"kinda\". He has been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump and has blamed modern problems in the United States on unrestrained capitalism.\nCarpenter holds a commercial pilot's license and flies helicopters. He has included helicopters in his films, many of which feature him in a cameo role as a pilot.\nLegacy.\nMany of Carpenter's films have been re-released on DVD as special editions with numerous bonus features. Examples of such are: the collector's editions of \"Halloween\", \"Escape from New York\", \"Christine\", \"The Thing\", \"Assault on Precinct 13\", \"Big Trouble In Little China\", and \"The Fog\". Some were re-issued with a new anamorphic widescreen transfer. In the UK, several of Carpenter's films have been released as DVD with audio commentary by Carpenter and his actors (\"They Live\", with actor/wrestler Roddy Piper, \"Starman\" with actor Jeff Bridges, and \"Prince of Darkness\" with actor Peter Jason).\nCarpenter is the subject of the documentary film \"John Carpenter: The Man and His Movies\", and American Cinematheque's 2002 retrospective of his films. Moreover, during 2006, the United States Library of Congress deemed \"Halloween\" to be \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nDuring 2010, writer and actor Mark Gatiss interviewed Carpenter about his career and films for his BBC documentary series \"A History of Horror\". Carpenter appears in all three episodes of the series. He was also interviewed by Robert Rodriguez for his \"The Director's Chair\" series on El Rey Network.\nFilmmakers that have been influenced by Carpenter include: James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, Robert Rodriguez, James Wan, Edgar Wright, Danny Boyle, Nicolas Winding Refn, Adam Wingard, Neil Marshall, Michael Dougherty, Ben Wheatley, Jeff Nichols, Bong Joon-ho, James Gunn, Mike Flanagan, David Robert Mitchell, The Duffer Brothers, Jeremy Saulnier, Trey Edward Shults, Drew Goddard, David F. Sandberg, James DeMonaco, Adam Green, Ted Geoghegan, Keith Gordon, Brian Patrick Butler, Jack Thomas Smith, and Marvin Kren. The video game \"Dead Space 3\" is said to be influenced by Carpenter's \"The Thing\", \"The Fog\", and \"Halloween\", and Carpenter has stated that he would be enthusiastic to adapt that series into a feature film. Specific films influenced by Carpenter's include Sean S. Cunningham's \"Friday the 13th\", which was inspired by the success of \"Halloween\", Tarantino's \"The Hateful Eight\", which was heavily influenced by \"The Thing\", Wingard's \"The Guest\", which was inspired by Michael Myers and influenced by \"\"'s music, Nichols' \"Midnight Special\", which is said to have used \"Starman\" as a reference point, and Kren's \"Blood Glacier\", which is said to be a homage to or recreation of \"The Thing\".\nHans Zimmer cited Carpenter as an influence on his compositions. The 2016 film \"The Void\" is considered by many critics and fans to be heavily influenced by several of Carpenter's films.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the indoor season, she swam at the Danvers YMCA from ages 8 to 10, and then at the Andover-North Andover YMCA from the ages of 10 to 12. At age 12 she began swimming for Seacoast Swimming Association under coaches Amy and Mike Parratto, and moved to Dover at age 13.\nShe first appeared on the international scene as a 14-year-old in 1987, when she won the 50-meter freestyle and placed third in the 100-meter freestyle at the Pan American Games. She won her first world championship in 1991, as part of the USA's winning 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay team, and held the world record in the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle when she participated in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.\nThompson attended Stanford University, and swam for the Stanford Cardinal swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Pacific-10 Conference competition. She was the recipient of the 1994\u201395 Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year.\nIn 2006, Thompson received a medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, completed a residency in anesthesiology at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and then a fellowship in pediatric anesthesiology at Children's Hospital of Boston.\nWorld competitions and records.\n1992 Olympics.\nThought to be at the height of her competitive career at the time, Thompson was expected to win up to five gold medals at those Olympics. However, she failed to qualify for the final in the 200-meter freestyle, finished a disappointing fifth in the 50-meter, and finished second in the 100-meter, where she was beaten by Zhuang Yong of China. Thompson won two gold medals as part of the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle and 4\u00d7100-meter medley teams. Considerable controversy was raised after the 100-meter freestyle when the U.S. team speculated on the loose doping policy standards in Barcelona\u2014at that time the event winner did not have a mandatory doping test\u2014only the second and fourth-place finishers were tested, based on a random draw. Thompson and her teammates believed that the Olympic champion should be tested and that rule was changed a few months later when nine members of the Chinese swimming team tested positive for steroid use.\nUniversity years.\nThompson continued her career as a member of the U.S. national team and a member of the Stanford University swimming team, and continued to rank among the world's best swimmers for the next four years. During Thompson's four years at Stanford, she was a member of four NCAA championship teams, considered to be some of the most dominant collegiate teams in NCAA history. During that time, Thompson amassed nineteen individual and relay NCAA titles. She competed as a member of the USA Finswimming Team at the 8th World Championship held in Hungary during August 1996. Thompson had a poor performance at the 1996 Olympic Trials which kept her from qualifying in her individual events.\n1996 Olympics.\nThompson won Gold medals on three relay teams at the Olympics; the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle, 4\u00d7100-meter medley, and 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle.\nBetween 1997 and 1999, Thompson won eight more world championship titles, including three in a row in the 100-meter freestyle.\n2000 Olympics.\nAt the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia she won a bronze in the 100-meter freestyle and was fifth in the 100-meter butterfly. But in the relay events, she swam the anchor leg in helping the USA defend its titles in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle and the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relays. She also swam the butterfly leg in the winning 4\u00d7100-meter relays. The 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle and medley teams set new world records in the process.\n2000 through 2004.\nAt the World Championships that year, she broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly for the fourth time, winning a qualifying heat in a time of 56.56 en route to a gold medal in the event.\nThompson seemingly retired from competition after the 2000 season with 10 Olympic medals, eight gold, one silver and one bronze, and 12 gold medals at World Championships. In 2001, Thompson moved to New York City to begin studying at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. However, while attending medical school, she made a return to competition at the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan. Thompson won five medals in two days, setting a career-best time in winning the 50-meter freestyle. At the 2003 World Championships, she would win five medals, including two gold medals.\n2004 Olympics.\nAt age 31, Thompson was the oldest member of the 2004 U.S. Swimming and Diving team, competing in her fourth Olympics in Athens, Greece. She was the anchor member of the 400-meter freestyle relay, where she contributed to a national record of 3:36.39 and a silver medal. She earned another silver medal as a member of the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay. During her Olympic career, Thompson won twelve medals, eight of which were relay gold; the most for any female Olympic swimmer in history.\nRecent life and work.\nIn 2006, Thompson received a medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She did her internship at the New York City Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and residency anesthesiologist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. In June 2010, she was assaulted when two men attempted to steal her scooter, but she was able to fight off both of her attackers.\nThompson married Daniel Richard Cumpelik on September 5, 2010.\nThompson has volunteered as a celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises money for cancer research, since 1995.\nAccolades and other recognition.\nShe was the 1993 and 1998 USA Swimming Swimmer of the Year, and ranked as the 62nd greatest female athlete of all time in a 1999 poll conducted by \"Sports Illustrated\".

{"id": "52263", "revid": "48887646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52263", "title": "Cliff Richard", "text": "British singer and actor (born 1940) \nSir Cliff Richard (born Harry Rodger Webb; 14 October 1940) is a British singer and actor. He has total sales of over 21.5\u00a0million singles in the United Kingdom and, as of 2012, was the third-top-selling artist in UK singles chart history, behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley. \nRichard was originally marketed as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the style of Presley and Little Richard. With his backing group, the Shadows, he dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s to early 1960s. His 1958 hit single \"Move It\" is often described as Britain's first authentic rock and roll song. He had a successful screen career with films including \"Expresso Bongo\" (1959), \"The Young Ones\" (1961), \"Summer Holiday\" (1963) and \"Wonderful Life\" (1964), and his own show on BBC Television. Increased focus on his Christian faith and subsequent softening of his music led to a more middle-of-the-road image, and he sometimes ventured into contemporary Christian music.\nIn a career spanning over 65 years, Richard has amassed several gold and platinum discs and awards, including two Ivor Novello Awards and three Brit Awards. More than 130 of his singles, albums, and EPs have reached the UK Top 20, more than any other artist. Richard has had 67 UK top ten singles, the second highest total for an artist (behind Presley). He holds the record, with Presley, as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950s\u20132000s). He has achieved 14 UK No. 1 singles, and is the only singer to have had a No. 1 single in the UK in each of five consecutive decades. He also had four UK Christmas No. 1 singles, two of which were as a solo artist; \"Mistletoe and Wine\" and \"Saviour's Day\".\nBy the late-1990s, Richard had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has never achieved the same popularity in the United States despite eight US Top 40 singles, including the million-selling \"Devil Woman\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore\". In Canada, he had a successful period in the early 1960s, the late 1970s and early 1980s, with some releases certified gold and platinum. He has remained a popular music, film, and television personality at home in the UK as well as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Northern Europe and Asia, and retains a following in other countries. When not touring, he divides his time between Barbados and Portugal. In 2019, he relocated to New York.\nLife and career.\n1940\u20131958: Childhood and adolescence.\nCliff Richard was born Harry Rodger Webb on 14 October 1940 at King George's Hospital (now King George's Medical University), Victoria Street, in Lucknow, which was then part of British India. His parents were Rodger Oscar Webb, a manager for a catering contractor that serviced the Indian Railways, and the former Dorothy Marie Dazely. His parents also spent some years in Howrah, West Bengal. After the violence of Direct Action Day, they decided to relocate to Britain permanently. Richard is primarily of English heritage, but he had one great-grandmother who was of half Welsh and half Spanish descent, born of a Spanish great-great-grandmother named Emiline Joseph Rebeiro.\nThe Webb family lived in a modest home in Maqbara, near the main shopping centre of Hazratganj in Lucknow. Dorothy's mother served as the dormitory matron at the La Martiniere Girls' School. Richard had three sisters, Joan, Jacqui and Donna (1942\u20132016).\nIn 1948, following Indian independence, the family embarked on a three-week sea voyage to Tilbury, Essex, England, aboard the . The Webbs moved from comparative wealth in India, where they lived in a company-supplied flat at Howrah near Calcutta, to a semi-detached house in Carshalton, north Surrey. Harry Webb attended a local primary school, Stanley Park Juniors, in Carshalton. \nIn 1949, his father obtained employment in the credit control office of Thorn Electrical Industries, Enfield, and the family moved in with other relatives in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, where he attended Kings Road Junior Mixed Infants School, until a three-bedroom council house in nearby Cheshunt was allocated to them in 1950, at 12 Hargreaves Close.\nHe then attended Cheshunt Secondary Modern School from 1952 to 1957. As a member of the top stream, he stayed on beyond the minimum leaving age to take GCE Ordinary Level examinations and gained a pass in English literature. He then started work as a filing clerk for Atlas Lamps. A development of retirement flats, Cliff Richard Court, has been named after him in Cheshunt.\nHarry Webb became interested in skiffle. When he was 16, his father bought him a guitar, and in 1957, he formed the school vocal harmony group The Quintones, before singing in the Dick Teague Skiffle Group.\n1958\u20131963: Success and stardom.\nHarry Webb became lead singer of a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name). The 1950s entrepreneur Harry Greatorex wanted the up-and-coming rock 'n' roll singer to change his name. The name \"Cliff\" was adopted as it sounded like \"cliff face\", which suggested \"Rock\". It was \"Move It\" writer Ian Samwell who suggested the surname \"Richard\" as a tribute to Webb's musical hero Little Richard.\nBefore their first large-scale appearance, at the Regal Ballroom in Ripley, Derbyshire in 1958, they adopted the name \"Cliff Richard and the Drifters\". The four members were Harry Webb (by then going under the stage name \"Cliff Richard\"), Ian Samwell on guitar, Terry Smart on drums and Norman Mitham on guitar. None of the other three played with the later and better known Shadows, although Samwell wrote songs for Richard's later career. Agent George Ganjou saw the group perform in London, and recommended them to Norrie Paramor for an audition.\nFor Richard's debut session, Paramor provided him with \"Schoolboy Crush\", a song previously recorded by American Bobby Helms. Richard was permitted to record one of his own songs for the B-side; this was \"Move It\", written and composed by the Drifters' Samwell while he was on board a number 715 Green Line bus on the way to Richard's house for a rehearsal. For the \"Move It\" session, Paramor used the session guitarist Ernie Shears on lead guitar and Frank Clark on bass.\nThere are various stories about why the A-side was replaced by the intended B-side. One is that Norrie Paramor's young daughter raved about the B-side; another was that influential TV producer Jack Good, who used the act for his TV show \"Oh Boy!\", wanted the only song on his show to be \"Move It\" as opposed to \"Schoolboy Crush\". Richard was quoted as saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's wonderful to be going on TV for the first time, but I feel so nervous that I don't know what to do. I shaved my sideburns off last night... Jack Good said it would make me look more original.\u2014\u200aThe single went to No. 2 on the UK singles chart. John Lennon credited \"Move It\" as being the first British rock record.\nIn the early days, Richard was marketed as the British equivalent of Elvis. Like previous British rockers such as Tommy Steele and Marty Wilde, Richard adopted Elvis-like dress and hairstyle. In performance he struck a pose of rock attitude, rarely smiling or looking at the audience or camera. His late 1958 and early 1959 follow-up singles, \"High Class Baby\" and \"Livin' Lovin' Doll\", were followed by \"Mean Streak\", which carried a rocker's sense of speed and passion, and Lionel Bart's \"Living Doll\".\nIt was on \"Living Doll\" that the Drifters began to back Richard on record. It was his fifth record and became his first No. 1 single. By that time, the group's line-up had changed with the arrival of Jet Harris, Tony Meehan, Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch. The group was obliged to change its name to \"The Shadows\" after legal complications with the American group the Drifters as \"Living Doll\" entered the American top 40, licensed by ABC-Paramount. \"Living Doll\" was used in Richard's d\u00e9but film \"Serious Charge\", but it was arranged as a country standard, rather than a rock and roll standard.\nThe Shadows were not a typical backing group. They became contractually separate from Richard, and the group received no royalties for records backing Richard. In 1959, the Shadows (then still the Drifters) landed an EMI recording contract of their own, for independent recordings. That year, they released three singles, two of which featured double-sided vocals and one of which had instrumental A and B sides. They thereafter had several major hits, including five UK No. 1s. The band also continued to appear and record with Richard and wrote many of his hits. On more than one occasion, a Shadows instrumental replaced a Richard song at the top of the British charts.\nRichard's fifth single \"Living Doll\" triggered a softer, more relaxed, sound. Subsequent hits, the No. 1s \"Travellin' Light\" and \"I Love You\" and also \"A Voice in the Wilderness\", lifted from his film \"Expresso Bongo\", and \"Theme for a Dream\" cemented Richard's status as a mainstream pop entertainer along with contemporaries such as Adam Faith and Billy Fury. Throughout the early 1960s, his hits were consistently in the top five.\nIn 1961, EMI records organised Richard's 21st birthday party at its London headquarters in Manchester Square led by his producer Norrie Paramor. Photographs of the celebrations were incorporated into Richard's next album, \"21 Today\", in which Tony Meehan joined in despite having very recently left the Shadows to be replaced by Brian Bennett.\nTypically, the Shadows closed the first half of the show with a 30-minute set of their own, then backed Richard on his show-closing 45-minute stint, as exemplified by the retrospective CD album release of \"Live at the ABC Kingston 1962\". Tony Meehan and Jet Harris left the group in 1961 and 1962 respectively, and later had their own chart successes for Decca. The Shadows added bass players Brian Locking (1962\u201363) and then John Rostill (1963\u201368) and took on Brian Bennett permanently on drums.\nIn the early years, particularly on album and EP releases, Richard also recorded ballads backed by the Norrie Paramor Orchestra with Tony Meehan (and later Brian Bennett) as a session drummer. His first such single without the Shadows was \"When the Girl in Your Arms Is the Girl in Your Heart\" in 1961, and he continued to release one or two per year, including covers of \"It's All in the Game\" in 1963 and \"Constantly\" in 1964, a revival of the popular Italian hit \"L'edera\". In 1965, sessions under the direction of Billy Sherrill in Nashville, Tennessee were particularly successful, yielding \"The Minute You're Gone\", which topped the UK singles chart, and \"Wind Me Up (Let Me Go)\", which made No. 2.\nRichard, and the Shadows in particular, however, never achieved star status in the United States. In 1960 they toured the United States and were well-received, but lacklustre support and distribution from a revolving door of American record labels proved an obstacle to long-term success there, despite several chart records by Richard, including the aforementioned \"It's All in the Game\" on Epic, via a renewed linking of the worldwide Columbia labels after Philips ended its distribution deal with CBS. To the Shadows' chagrin, \"Apache\" reached No. 2 in the US through a cover version by Danish guitarist Jorgen Ingmann which was almost unchanged from their worldwide hit. Richard and the band appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", which was crucial for the Beatles, but these performances did not help them gain sustained success in North America.\nRichard and the Shadows appeared in six feature films, including a debut in the 1959 film \"Serious Charge\" but most notably in \"The Young Ones\", \"Summer Holiday\", \"Wonderful Life\", and \"Finders Keepers\". These films created their own genre, known as the \"Cliff Richard musical\", and led to Richard's being named the No. 1 cinema box office attraction in Britain for both 1962 and 1963, even beating the \"James Bond\" films. The title song of \"The Young Ones\" became his biggest-selling single in the United Kingdom, selling over one million copies in the UK. The irreverent 1980s TV sitcom \"The Young Ones\" took its name from Richard's 1962 film. In mid-1963, Cliff and the Shadows appeared for a season in Blackpool, where Richard had his portrait modelled by Victor Heyfron.\n1964\u20131975: Changing circumstances.\nAs with the other contemporary rock acts in Britain, Richard's career was affected by the advent of the Beatles and the Mersey sound in 1963 and 1964. He continued to be popular and have hits in the charts throughout the 1960s, though not at the level that he had enjoyed before. Nor did doors open to him in the US market; he was not considered part of the British Invasion, and despite four Hot 100 hits (including the top 25 \"It's All in the Game\") between August 1963 and August 1964, the American public had little awareness of him.\nAlthough baptised as an Anglican, Richard did not practise the faith in his early years. In 1964, he became an active evangelical Christian and his faith is an important aspect of his life. Standing up publicly as an evangelical affected his career in several ways. Initially, he believed that he should quit rock 'n' roll, feeling he could no longer be the rocker who had been called a \"crude exhibitionist\" and \"too sexy for TV\". Richard intended at first to \"reform his ways\" and become a teacher, but evangelical Christian friends advised him not to abandon his career. Soon after, Richard re-emerged, performing with Christian groups and recording some overtly Christian material. He still recorded secular songs with the Shadows but devoted a lot of his time to Christian-based work, including appearances with the Billy Graham crusades. Over time, Richard balanced his faith and work, enabling him to remain one of the most popular singers in Britain as well as one of its best-known evangelical Christians.\nRichard's 1965 UK No. 12 hit \"On My Word\" ended a run of 23 consecutive top ten UK hits between \"A Voice in the Wilderness\" in 1960 to \"The Minute You're Gone\" in 1965, which, to date, is still a record number of consecutive top ten UK hits for a male artist. Richard continued having international hits, including 1967's \"The Day I Met Marie\", which reached No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 5 in the Australian charts.\nRichard acted in the 1967 film \"Two a Penny\", released by Billy Graham's World Wide Pictures, in which he played Jamie Hopkins, a young man who gets involved in drug dealing while questioning his life after his girlfriend changes her attitude. He released the live album \"Cliff in Japan\" in 1967.\nIn 1968, Richard sang the UK's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest, \"Congratulations\", written and composed by Bill Martin and Phil Coulter; it finished second, however, by one point to Spain's \"La La La\" by Massiel. According to John Kennedy O'Connor's \"The Eurovision Song Contest\u2014The Official History\", this was the closest result yet in the contest, and Richard locked himself in the toilet to avoid the nerves of the voting. Nevertheless, \"Congratulations\" was a big hit throughout Europe and in Australia and another UK No. 1 in April 1968.\nAfter the Shadows disbanded in 1968, Richard continued to record. During the 1970s, he took part in several television shows and fronted his own show, \"It's Cliff Richard\", from 1970 to 1976. It starred Olivia Newton-John, Hank Marvin and Una Stubbs and included \"A Song for Europe\". He began 1970 by appearing live on the BBC's review of the sixties music scene, \"Pop Go The Sixties\", which was broadcast across Britain and Europe on 31 December 1969. He performed \"Bachelor Boy\" with the Shadows and \"Congratulations\" solo. In 1972, he made a short BBC television comedy film called \"The Case\" with appearances from comedians and his first ever duets with a woman \u2014 Olivia Newton-John. He went on to release a double live album, \"Cliff Live in Japan 1972\", which featured Newton-John.\nHis final film acting role was in the 1973 British film \"Take Me High\".\nIn 1973, he sang the British Eurovision entry \"Power to All Our Friends\", the song finished third close behind Luxembourg's \" by Anne-Marie David and Spain's \" by Mocedades. This time, Richard took Valium to overcome his nerves and his manager was almost unable to wake him for the performance. Richard also hosted the BBC's qualifying heat for the Eurovision Song Contest, \"A Song for Europe,\" in 1970, 1971, and 1972 as part of his BBCTV variety series. He also presented the Eurovision Song Contest Previews for the BBC in 1971 and 1972.\nIn 1975, he released the single \"Honky Tonk Angel\", produced by Hank Marvin and John Farrar, oblivious to its connotations or hidden meanings. As soon as he was notified that a \"honky-tonk angel\" was southern US slang for a prostitute, the horrified Richard ordered EMI to withdraw it and refused to promote it despite having made a video for it. EMI agreed to his demand despite the fact that the single was expected to sell well. About 1,000 copies are known to exist on vinyl.\n1976\u20131994: Renaissance.\nIn 1976, the decision was made to repackage Richard as a rock artist. That year, Bruce Welch relaunched Cliff's career and produced the landmark album \"I'm Nearly Famous\", which included the successful but controversial guitar-driven track \"Devil Woman\", which became Richard's first true hit in the United States, and the ballad \"Miss You Nights\". In reviewing the new album in \"Melody Maker\", Geoff Brown heralded it the renaissance of Richard. Richard's fans were excited about this revival of a performer who had been a part of British rock from its early days. Many big names in music such as Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and Elton John were seen sporting \"I'm Nearly Famous\" badges, pleased that their boyhood idol was getting back into the heavier rock in which he had begun his career.\nNotwithstanding this, Richard continued to release albums with contemporary Christian music content in parallel with his rock and pop albums, for example: \"Small Corners\" from 1978 contained the single \"Yes He Lives\". On 31 December 1976, he performed his latest single, \"Hey, Mr. Dream Maker\", on BBC1's \"A Jubilee of Music\", celebrating British pop music for Queen Elizabeth II's impending Silver Jubilee.\nIn 1979, Richard teamed up again with producer Bruce Welch for the pop single \"We Don't Talk Anymore\", written and composed by Alan Tarney, which hit No. 1 in the UK and No. 7 in the US. Bryan Ferry added hummed backing vocals to the song. The record made Richard the first act to reach the Hot 100's top 40 in the 1980s who had also been there in each of the three previous decades. The song was quickly added onto the end of his latest album \"Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile,\" which was re-titled \"We Don't Talk Anymore\" for its release in the United States. It was his first time at the top of the UK singles chart in over ten years, and the song would become his biggest-selling single worldwide, selling almost five million copies throughout the world. Later in 1979, Richard performed with Kate Bush at the London Symphony Orchestra's 75th anniversary celebration at the Royal Albert Hall.\nWith \"We Don't Talk Anymore\" in 1979, Richard finally began to receive some extended success in the United States to follow on from the success of \"Devil Woman\" in 1976. In 1980, \"Carrie\" broke into the US top 40, followed by \"Dreamin'\", which reached No. 10. His 1980 duet \"Suddenly\" with Olivia Newton-John, from the film \"Xanadu\", peaked at No. 20, followed by \"A Little in Love\" (No. 17) and \"Daddy's Home\" (No. 23) in 1981. After many years of limited success in the US, three of his singles simultaneously charted on the last Hot 100 of 1980 (\"A Little in Love\", \"Dreamin'\", and \"Suddenly\").\nIn the UK, meanwhile, \"Carrie\" reached No. 4 and \"Dreamin'\" peaked at No. 8. In a retrospective review of \"Carrie\", AllMusic journalist Dave Thompson praised \"Carrie\" as being \"an enthrallingly atmospheric number. One of the most electrifying of all Cliff Richard's recordings.\"\nIn 1980, Richard officially changed his name, by deed poll, from Harry Rodger Webb to Cliff Richard. At the same time, he received, from the Queen, the award of Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to music and charity.\nIn 1981, the single \"Wired for Sound\" reached No. 4 in the UK and also became Richard's biggest hit in Australia since the early 1960s. To finish the year, \"Daddy's Home\" reached No. 2 in the UK. On the singles chart, Richard was having his most consistent period of top twenty hits since the mid-1960s. He also was amassing a string of top ten albums, including \"I'm No Hero\", \"Wired for Sound\", \"Now You See Me, Now You Don't\", a live album he recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra titled \"Dressed for the Occasion\", and \"Silver\", marking his 25th year in show business in 1983.\nIn 1986, Richard reached No. 1 by teaming up with the cast of the comedy series \"The Young Ones\" to re-record \"Living Doll\" for the charity Comic Relief. Along with the song, the recording contained comedy dialogue between Richard and the Young Ones. That same year, Richard opened in the West End as a rock musician called upon to defend Earth in a trial set in the Andromeda Galaxy in the multi-media Dave Clark musical \"Time\". Three Richard singles, \"She's So Beautiful\", which reached No. 17 in the UK, \"It's in Every One of Us\" and \"Born To Rock 'n Roll\", were released over 1985 and 1986 from the concept album recorded for \"Time\".\nIn August 1986, Richard was involved in a five-car crash in torrential rain on the M4 motorway in West London. Richard's car was a write-off,as another car swerved and braked hard. Richard hurt his back in the accident, but was not seriously injured. Police called for a cab from the accident scene so that he was able to perform that night in the \"Time\" musical. After the show, Richard said: \"I'm lucky to be here\". He said that his seatbelt had prevented him from flying through the windscreen.\nIn October 1986, \"All I Ask of You\", a duet that Richard recorded with Sarah Brightman from the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical version of The Phantom of the Opera reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart. 1987 saw the release of his \"Always Guaranteed\" album, which became his best-selling album of all-new material, and included the two top-10 hit singles \"My Pretty One\" and \"Some People\".\nRichard concluded his thirtieth year in music by achieving a UK Christmas No. 1 single in 1988 with \"Mistletoe and Wine\", while simultaneously holding the No. 1 positions on the album and video charts with the compilation \"\", which collected his biggest hits from 1979 to 1988. \"Mistletoe and Wine\" was Richard's 99th UK single and spent four weeks at the top of the chart. It was the best-selling UK single of 1988, shifting 750,000 copies. The album was certified quadruple platinum, becoming Richard's first to be certified multi-platinum by the BPI since it had introduced multi-platinum awards in February 1987.\nIn May 1989, Richard released his 100th single, \"The Best of Me\", becoming the first British artist to achieve the feat. The single peaked at No. 2 in the UK. It was also the lead single from the UK top ten album \"Stronger\". Released along with the singles \"I Just Don't Have the Heart\" (UK No. 3), \"Lean On You\" (No. 17) and \"Stronger Than That\" (No. 14), the album become Richard's first studio album to amass four UK top twenty hits.\nIn 1989, Richard received the Brits Awards honour for \"Outstanding Contribution\". In June that year, he played London's Wembley Stadium for two nights with a spectacular titled The Event in front of a combined audience of 144,000 people.\nOn 30 June 1990, Richard performed to an estimated 120,000 people at England's Knebworth Park as part of an all-star concert line-up that also included Paul McCartney, Phil Collins, Elton John and Tears for Fears. The concert in aid of charity was televised around the world and helped to raise $10.5\u00a0million for disabled children and young musicians.\nLater in 1990, a live album titled \"\" was released. It compiled highlights of the previous year's The Event show, and provided two live tracks as singles, \"Silhouettes\" (UK No. 10) and \"From a Distance\" (No. 11). However, it was with the Christmas single \"Saviour's Day\" that Richard scored his 13th UK No. 1 single and his 100th top 40 hit. The album itself reached No. 3 over the Christmas period and was certified double platinum by the BPI.\nFollowing the success of the recent Christmas singles, Richard released his first Christmas album, \"Together with Cliff Richard\", in 1991, but his bid for the UK Christmas No. 1 spot again with \"We Should Be Together\" was unsuccessful (making No. 10). 1992 saw \"I Still Believe in You\" (No. 7) released as his Christmas single, while 1993 saw Richard's first new music studio album for over three years released. Simply titled \"The Album\", it debuted at No. 1 on the UK album chart. \"Peace in Our Time\" (No. 8) was the second lead single, followed by \"Human Work of Art\" (No. 24) and \"Healing Love\" (No. 19) for Christmas. In 1994, the compilation \"The Hit List\" was released; meanwhile in the background, Richard was concentrating on bringing the musical \"Heathcliff\" to the stage.\nWith Richard's succession of hit songs and albums from the late 1970s into the early 1980s, followed by another strong run in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a strong fan base had been reestablished and Richard remained one of the best-known music artists in the country. Over the course of the 1980s, he recorded with Olivia Newton-John, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Phil Everly, Janet Jackson, Sheila Walsh and Van Morrison. Meanwhile, the Shadows later re-formed (and again split). They recorded on their own, but also reunited with Richard in 1978, 1984 and 1989\u201390.\n1995\u20132007: Knighthood.\nOn 17 June 1995, Richard was appointed a Knight Bachelor (invested on 25 October 1995), becoming the first rock star to be so honoured. In 1996, he led the Wimbledon Centre Court crowd in singing during a rain delay when asked by Wimbledon officials to entertain the crowd. In the late 1990s, Richard and former EMI UK managing director Clive Black established the record label Blacknight. In 1998, Richard demonstrated that radio stations were refusing to play his music when he released a dance remix of his forthcoming single \"Can't Keep This Feeling In\" on a white label record using the alias Blacknight. The single was featured on playlists until the artist's identity was revealed. Richard then released the single under his own name as the lead single for his album \"Real as I Wanna Be\", with each reaching No. 10 in the UK on their respective charts.\nIn 1999, controversy again arose regarding radio stations refusing to play his releases when EMI, Richard's label since 1958, refused to release his song, \"The Millennium Prayer\", having judged that the song did not have commercial potential. Richard took it to an independent label, Papillon, which released the charity recording (in aid of Children's Promise). The single went on to top the UK chart for three weeks, becoming his fourteenth and, as of December 2022, most recent No. 1 single.\nRichard's next album, in 2001, was a covers project, \"Wanted,\" followed by another top ten album, \"Cliff at Christmas\". The holiday album contained both new and older recordings, including the single \"Santa's List\", which reached No. 5 in 2003. Richard went to Nashville, Tennessee for his next album project in 2004, employing a writers' conclave to give him the pick of all new songs for the album \"Something's Goin' On\". It was another top 10 album, and produced three UK top 20 singles: \"Something's Goin' On\", \"I Cannot Give You My Love\", with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees, and \"What Car\".\nOn 14 June 2004, Richard joined the Shadows on-stage at the London Palladium. The Shadows had decided to re-form for another tour of the UK. It was not to be their last tour together, however, as they would re-form once again for a final tour five years later, in 2009.\n\"Two's Company\", an album of duets released in 2006, was another top 10 success for Richard and included newly recorded material with Brian May, Dionne Warwick, Anne Murray, Barry Gibb and Daniel O'Donnell, plus some previously recorded duets with artists such as Phil Everly, Elton John and Olivia Newton-John. \"Two's Company\" was released to coincide with the UK leg of his latest world tour, Here and Now, which included lesser known songs such as \"My Kinda Life\", \"How Did She Get Here\", \"Hey Mr. Dream Maker\", \"For Life\", \"A Matter of Moments\", \"When The Girl in Your Arms\" and the Christmas single \"21st Century Christmas\", which debuted at No. 2 on the UK singles chart.\nAnother compilation album, \"Love... The Album\" was released on 12 November 2007. Like \"Two's Company\" before it, this album includes both previously released material and newly recorded songs, namely \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\", \"When You Say Nothing at All\", \"All Out of Love\", \"If You're Not the One\" and \"When I Need You\" (the last was released as a single, reaching No. 38; the album peaked at No. 13).\n2008\u2013present: 50th anniversary and Shadows reunion.\nIn 2008, Richard's 51st year in the music business, the eight-CD box set \"And They Said It Wouldn't Last (My 50 Years in Music)\" was released. In September, a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music, \"Thank You for a Lifetime\", was released. On 14 September 2008 it reached No. 3 on the UK music charts.\nOn 11 November 2008, Richard's official website announced that he and the Shadows would reunite to celebrate their 50th anniversary in the music business. A month later they performed at the Royal Variety Performance. In 2009, they brought their partnership to an end with the golden anniversary concert tour of the UK.\nA new album, titled \"Reunited\", by Richard and the Shadows, was released in September 2009. It was their first studio project in 40 years. The 28 tracks recorded comprise 25 re-recordings of their earlier work, with three \"new\" tracks, originally from that era (and earlier), the single \"Singing the Blues\", along with Eddie Cochran's \"C'mon Everybody\" and the Frankie Ford hit \"Sea Cruise\". The album charted at No. 6 in the UK charts in its opening week and peaked at No. 4. The reunion tour continued into Europe in 2010. In June 2009, it was reported by Sound Kitchen Studios in Nashville that Richard was to return there shortly to record a new album of original recordings of jazz songs. He was to record fourteen tracks in a week.\nRichard performed \"Congratulations\" at the 70th birthday celebrations of Queen Margrethe II in Denmark on 13 April 2010. On 14 October 2010, Richard celebrated his 70th birthday, and to mark the occasion, he performed a series of six concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, London. To accompany the concerts, a new album of cover versions of swing standards, \"Bold as Brass\", was released on 11 October. The official party celebrating Richard's 70th birthday was held on 23 October 2010, with guests including Cilla Black, Elaine Paige and Daniel O'Donnell.\nAfter a week of promotion, Richard flew out to rehearse for the German Night of the Proms concerts in Belgium at the end of October. He made a surprise appearance at the Antwerp concert of the Night of the Proms on Thursday, 28 October 2010 and sang \"We Don't Talk Anymore\" to a great reaction from the surprised 20,000 fans at Sportpaleis Antwerp. In all, he toured 12 German cities in November and December 2010, during the Night of the Proms concerts, as the headline act. The total of 18 concerts were attended by over 300,000 fans. Richard performed a selection of hits and tracks from the \"Bold As Brass\" album. In November 2010, he achieved his third consecutive UK No. 1 music DVD in three years with the DVD release of \"Bold as Brass\".\nIn October 2011, Richard released his \"Soulicious\" album, containing duets with American soul singers including Percy Sledge, Ashford and Simpson, Roberta Flack, Freda Payne and Candi Staton. The album was produced by Lamont Dozier and was supported by a short UK arena tour. \"Soulicious\" became Richard's 41st top 10 UK hit album.\nHe was among the performers at the Diamond Jubilee concert held outside Buckingham Palace in June 2012. On 30 June 2012, Richard helped to carry the Olympic torch from Derby to Birmingham as part of the torch relay for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Richard said that his run with the Olympic torch would be one of his top 10 memories.\nRichard was involved in a campaign to extend copyright on sound recordings in the UK from 50 to 95 years, and extend the number of years on which a musician can receive royalties. The campaign was initially unsuccessful, and the UK copyright on many of Richard's early recordings expired in 2008. In 2013, following another campaign, copyright on sound recordings was extended to 70 years after first publication to the public for works still in copyright at that point. This means Richard's recordings between 1958 and 1962 are out of copyright in the UK, but those from 1963 will be in copyright until 2034. In November 2013, Richard released the 100th album of his career, \"The Fabulous Rock 'n' Roll Songbook\". By that point, Richard had released 47 studio albums, 35 compilations, 11 live albums and 7 film soundtracks.\nRichard was scheduled to open for Morrissey at a live concert at New York's 19,000-capacity Barclays Center on 21 June 2014. Morrissey said that he was \"honoured and thrilled\" to have Richard on the bill. It was reported on 16 June 2014 that Morrissey had cancelled the concert after collapsing with an \"acute fever\". Richard announced that he would stage a free show for fans in New York on the same night the cancelled concert was due to take place.\nIn October 2015, Richard performed on tour to mark his 75th birthday. He took to the stage across seven cities in the UK, including six nights at London's Royal Albert Hall, where he has performed on over 100 occasions during his career. Richard's 2015 tour received a positive review from \"The Guardian\"'s rock music critic Dave Simpson.\nIn August 2018, Richard announced the release of the album \"Rise Up\", which includes new material. The first single of the album, \"Rise Up\", was released in vinyl format and reached No. 1 on the UK Vinyl Singles Chart in October 2018. He performed a duet with Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler on \"Taking Control\", which appeared on her 2019 studio album, \"Between the Earth and the Stars\". In 2020 Richard released the album \"Music... The Air That I Breathe\". On 4 July 2022, Richard sang his 1963 hit \"Summer Holiday\" at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, as part of the Centenary Celebration.\nCriticism of the music industry and commercial support.\nRichard has openly complained about the lack of commercial support he receives from radio stations and record labels. He spoke about this on \"The Alan Titchmarsh Show\" on ITV in December 2007, pointing out that while new bands needed airplay for promotion and sales, long-established artists such as himself also relied upon airplay for the same reasons. He also noted that 1980s radio stations did play his records and that this went some way to help sales and maintain his media presence. In the BBC Radio 2 documentary \"Cliff \u2013 Take Another Look\", he pointed out that many documentaries charting the history of British music (e.g. \"I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band!\") fail to mention him (or the Shadows).\nIn 1998, Chris Evans, the then breakfast show host on Virgin Radio, vowed he would never again play a record by Richard, stating that he was \"too old\". In June 2004, British disc jockey Tony Blackburn was suspended from his radio job at Classic Gold Digital for playing records by Richard against station policy. The head of programmes, Paul Baker, sent an e-mail to Blackburn stating that Richard \"doesn't match our brand values. He's not on the playlist, and you must stop playing him.\" On Blackburn's next morning breakfast show, he read a print-out of the e-mail live on air to the show's 400,000 listeners and went on to play two songs by Richard. Classic Gold managing director John Baish later confirmed Blackburn's suspension from the show.\nIn 2011, digital station Absolute Radio '60s, dedicated to playing popular music from the 1960s, announced they would not be playing any of Richard's records because they said they did not fit \"the cool sound... we're trying to create\". DJ Pete Mitchell said: \"Timeless acts of the decade that remain relevant today are the Beatles, the Stones, the Doors and the Who, not Sir Cliff.\" Richard responded to this by saying: \"They're lying to themselves, and more importantly they're lying to the public.\"\nRichard has spoken of his irritation about other stars who are praised after taking drugs. In 2009, Richard said he was the \"most radical rock-and-roll singer Britain has ever seen\" as he did not indulge in drugs or sexual promiscuity. Richard said he is proud that he never adopted the hedonistic lifestyle of a typical rock star. He said: \"I've never wanted to trash a hotel room.\"\nRichard has criticised the music industry for encouraging artists to court controversy. In November 2013, he said: \"The music industry has changed drastically and that damages young artists. This industry can be very destructive.\" Richard expressed concern about the sexually explicit public image of singer Miley Cyrus, following controversy surrounding a semi-naked video for her song \"Wrecking Ball\". In the 1970s, Richard said that he was disturbed by the visual imagery and mock horror of singer Alice Cooper. In 1997, Richard said of the rock band Oasis: \"It's just a shame that part of what gives them their kick is their self-destructive impulse.\"\nIn an article for \"The Guardian\" in 2011, the journalist Sam Leith wrote of Richard's lack of commercial support among radio stations: \"His uncompromising Christianity, his clean-living ways, and his connoisseurship of the fruits of his Portuguese winery have made him an object of incomprehension, even ridicule, for the uncultured, alcopop-drinking younger generation.\" Also writing in \"The Guardian\", John Robb opined that because Richard has rebelled against the drink and drugs culture of typical rock stars, this \"rebelling against rebellion\" has made Richard something of a countercultural icon.\nIn December 2013, Richard said that he felt two of his singles, \"Mistletoe and Wine\" and \"The Millennium Prayer\", had created a negative reaction against him. He said: \"Airplay is vital for single hits. The only way I can have a fair competition is if your records are on the radio. There is an ageism in the radio industry. If you ask me to record a new song, I'm not sure it would get the support it needs.\"\nAuthor and rock music critic Tony Parsons said: \"If you don't like at least some Cliff Richard, then you don't like pop music\". Sting also defended Richard, stating: \"Cliff Richard is in my opinion one of Britain's finest singers technically and emotionally.\"\nPersonal life.\nRichard's father, Rodger Webb, died in 1961, aged 56, which greatly affected Richard. He later said: \"My father died very young. He missed the best parts of my career. When my father was sick, we became very close.\" Richard's mother, Dorothy, died in October 2007, aged 87, after a decade with Alzheimer's disease. In a 2006 interview, he spoke about the difficulties he and his sisters had in dealing with their mother's condition.\nRichard is a lifelong bachelor. In a three-page letter written in October 1961 to \"his first serious girlfriend\", Australian dancer Delia Wicks, which was made public in April 2010 after her death from cancer, Richard wrote, \"Being a pop singer I have to give up one priceless thing \u2013 the right to any lasting relationship with any special girl. I've just had to make, probably, one of the biggest decisions I'm ever going to make and I'm hoping that it won't hurt you too much.\" The couple had been dating for 18 months. In the letter he goes on to say, \"I couldn't give up my career, besides the fact that my mother and sisters, since my father's death, rely on me completely. I have showbiz in my blood now and I would be lost without it.\" Richard urged her to \"find someone who is free to love you as you deserve to be loved\" and who \"is able to marry you\".\nAfter Delia Wicks died in 2010, aged 71, her brother Graham Wicks said that she had been \"devastated\" by Richard's decision to end their relationship, describing Richard as \"a very pleasant man\".\nAt the age of 22, a year after his relationship with Delia Wicks ended, Richard had a brief romance with the actress Una Stubbs. Later in the 1960s, Richard considered marriage to the dancer Jackie Irving. Richard described Irving as \"utterly beautiful\" and says for a time they were \"inseparable\". Irving went on to marry Adam Faith.\nIn his autobiography, Richard stressed that \"sex is not one of the things that drives me\", but he also wrote of his seduction by Carol Costa, who at the time was the estranged wife of Jet Harris.\nIn the 1980s, Richard considered asking Sue Barker, a former French Open tennis champion and Wimbledon semi-finalist, if she would agree to marry him. In 2008, Richard said of his relationship with Barker: \"I seriously contemplated asking her to marry me, but in the end I realised that I didn't love her quite enough to commit the rest of my life to her.\"\nRichard first met Barker in 1982, when she was aged 25. Their romance attracted considerable media attention after Richard flew to Denmark to watch her play in a tennis match and they were later photographed cuddling and holding hands at Wimbledon. In an interview in February 1983, Richard spoke of the possibility of marriage with her. He said: \"I'm seeing Sue, the only girl I want to see at the moment and if marriage comes on the horizon, I shall relish it.\" In September 1983, Richard said that he had no immediate plans to marry Barker. He said: \"It's not vital to get married and it's not vital to be a father. But I would like to settle down and have a family one day.\" In July 1984, Barker said of her romance with Richard: \"I love him, he's great and I'm sure we love each other.\"\nIn 1986, after Richard's romance with Barker had ended and she began dating tennis player Stephen Shaw, Richard said that he was still a friend of Barker. He said: \"We have a mutual respect for each other and that means a lot to me.\"\nWhen later asked why he has never married, Richard said: \"I've had a few false alarms. I've been in love, but marriage is a big commitment and being an artist consumes a great deal of time.\" He said that in the early 1970s he was in love with the singer and actress Olivia Newton-John. Richard said: \"At the time when I and many of us were in love with Olivia she was engaged to someone else. I'm afraid I lost the chance.\"\nIn 1988, Richard's nephew, Philip Harrison, spent the first four months of his life in a children's hospital suffering from serious breathing problems. Richard later helped to raise money for the hospital in east London and said that his nephew \"had a terrible time but the hospital saved his life\".\nAlthough he has never married, Richard has rarely lived alone. For many years, he shared his main home with his charity and promotion schedules manager, Bill Latham, and Latham's mother. In 1982, Richard described them as his \"second family\". Latham's girlfriend, Jill, also lived at the house in Weybridge, Surrey, with them for a time. In 1993, Bill Latham said of Richard's bachelor status: \"His freedom has meant that he has been able to do much more than if he had a family. He always goes the extra mile. If he was to have a relationship, he would give it everything. So because his commitments have been his career, his faith, and more latterly, tennis, he has given himself wholeheartedly to those three activities.\"\nRichard often declines discussion about close relationships, and when asked about suggestions that he may be homosexual has stated categorically that he is not. When the suggestions were first put to him in the late 1970s, Richard responded by saying: \"It's untrue. People are very unfair with their criticism and their judgements. I've had girlfriends. But people seem to think that if a bloke doesn't sleep around he must be gay. Marriage is a very special thing to me. I'm certainly not going to do it just to make other people feel satisfied.\" In 1986, Richard said that rumours about his being homosexual had previously been \"very painful\" to him.\nWhen asked in 1992 if he had ever considered the possibility that he might be gay, he responded: \"No\". Richard said: \"Even if I got married tomorrow there would be a group of people who would believe what they wanted to believe. All that counts is what your family and friends know and they all trust and respect me. What the people outside think, I have no control over.\" Later in 1996, Richard said: \"I'm aware of the rumours, but I am not gay.\" In 1997, he said: \"People who are single shouldn't have to be second-class citizens \u2013 we needn't be embarrassed or feel guilty about it, we all have a role to play.\"\nRichard said that his faith in God was tested in 1999 after the murder of his close friend, the British television presenter Jill Dando. He said: \"I was really angry with God. It shook me rigid that someone as beautiful, talented and harmless could have been killed.\" Richard said that Dando had many likeable qualities and described her as \"a very genuine person\". He said of Dando's murder: \"It is very difficult to understand and I find it all very confusing.\" He attended her funeral in May 1999 in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.\nRichard has spoken of his friendship with John McElynn, an American former missionary whom he met in 2001 on a visit to New York City. In 2008, Richard said: \"John now spends most of his time looking after my properties, which means I don't have to. John and I have over time struck up a close friendship. He has also become a companion, which is great because I don't like living alone, even now.\"\nIn an interview with David Frost in 2002, Richard said that his many good friends have prevented him from feeling lonely and he has always has someone he can talk to. Richard has been a family friend of the Northern Irish broadcaster Gloria Hunniford for over 50 years. When Hunniford's daughter Caron Keating was diagnosed with breast cancer and chose to keep her illness private from the public, Richard was among a small close circle of friends who knew of Keating's condition. When Keating died in April 2004, Richard attended her funeral in Kent and performed his song \"Miss You Nights\" in tribute to her.\nIn 2006, Richard received a Portuguese order, in which he was appointed Commander of the Order of Prince Henry (ComIH), in recognition of his 40 years of personal and business involvement in the country, which included investments in winemaking and a house in the Algarve where he has spent part of the year throughout the decades. Richard finished No. 56 in the 2002 100 Greatest Britons list, sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the public.\nIn his 2008 autobiography, Richard wrote that his views on certain issues are less judgemental than when he was younger. He called on the Church of England to affirm people's commitment in same-sex marriage. He wrote: \"In the end, I believe, people are going to be judged for what they are. It seems to me that commitment is the issue, and if anyone comes to me and says: 'This is my partner \u2013 we are committed to each other,' then I don't care what their sexuality is. I'm not going to judge \u2013 I'll leave that to God.\"\nIn 2009, the British media reported on a growing friendship between Richard and Cilla Black. \"The Daily Telegraph\" said that Richard and Black looked at properties together in Miami and were regularly seen together in Barbados, where they both owned villas. Richard and Black reportedly enjoyed each other's company dining together in Marbella and watching tennis in the Royal Box at Wimbledon. After Black died in August 2015, Richard described her as \"incredibly gifted\" and \"full of heart\". He said: \"She was a very special person, and I have lost a very wonderful friend. I will miss her dearly.\" Richard performed the song \"Faithful One\" in tribute to Black at her funeral in Liverpool.\nIn 2010, Richard confirmed that he is no longer a resident of the United Kingdom and had been granted citizenship by Barbados. He said: \"I'm officially a non-resident [of the UK], although I will always be British and proud of it.\" He currently divides his time between living in Barbados and Portugal. When asked in February 2013 if he had regrets about not starting a family, Richard said that if he had been married with children he could not have devoted so much time to his career. He said: \"My three sisters have children, and it's been wonderful to watch them grow up, get married and start families of their own. I've made sure I've always played a part in their lives. So while I think I would have been a good father, I've given myself to my family and I wouldn't have it any other way. My 'freedom' allows me to continue my career. Had I been married, with children, I wouldn't be able to do what I do now.\"\nNationwide Festival of Light.\nIn 1971, Richard was a leading supporter of the Nationwide Festival of Light, a movement formed by British Christians who were concerned about the development of the permissive society. Richard joined public figures such as Malcolm Muggeridge, Mary Whitehouse and Bishop Trevor Huddleston to demonstrate in London \"for love and family life, against pornography and moral pollution\". Muggeridge criticised the media as being \"largely in the hands of those who for one reason or another favour the present Gadarene slide into decadence and Godlessness\".\nOne of the targets for the Festival of Light's campaign was the growth of sexually explicit films. Richard was one of approximately 30,000 people who gathered at London's Trafalgar Square for a demonstration. One focus of their protest was against the Swedish sex education film \"Language of Love\", which was showing at a nearby cinema.\nPhilanthropy.\nSince March 1966, Richard has followed the practice of tithing, giving away at least one-tenth of his income to charity. Richard has stated that two biblical principles have guided him in how to use his money. He said: \"Firstly, it was the love of money (not money itself) that was the root of all evil. Secondly, to be good and responsible stewards of what was entrusted to us.\" In 1990, Richard said: \"Those of us who have something to offer have to be prepared to give all the time.\"\nFor over forty years, Richard has been a supporter of Tearfund, a Christian charity that aims to tackle poverty in many countries across the world. He has made overseas visits to see their work in Uganda, Bangladesh and Brazil. Richard has said: \"Playing a part in relieving poverty is, as I see it, the responsibility of us all.\"\nRichard has donated to the dementia research charity, Alzheimer's Research UK. He has helped to raise funds and awareness of the disease by speaking publicly about his mother's condition.\nRichard has also supported numerous UK charities over many years through the Cliff Richard Charitable Trust, both through donations and by making personal visits to schools, churches, hospitals, and homes for special needs children. Richard's passion for tennis, which was encouraged by his former girlfriend, Sue Barker, also led him in 1991 to establish the Cliff Richard Tennis Foundation. The charity has encouraged thousands of primary schools in the UK to introduce the sport, with over 200,000 children taking part in the tennis sessions which tour the country. The foundation has since become part of the charitable wing of the Lawn Tennis Association.\nScottish independence referendum.\nIn August 2014, Richard was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to \"The Guardian\" expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue.\nProperty search, investigation and BBC litigation.\nIn August 2014, Richard's apartment in Berkshire was searched after a complaint to the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, which investigated sexual misconduct allegations in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Richard was not arrested, and strongly denied the allegations. The BBC was criticised for its coverage of the search. The former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, QC, criticised the police force for its \"completely disreputable conduct\" and said its action could make the warrant unlawful. Richard pulled out of a visit to the US Open tennis championships, turned down the freedom of his adopted Portuguese home city of Albufeira, and cancelled a scheduled appearance at Canterbury Cathedral because he did not want the event to be \"overshadowed by the false allegation\". He returned to the UK and was interviewed voluntarily by members of South Yorkshire Police. He was never arrested or criminally charged. David Crompton, chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, was criticised for his interactions with the BBC, and publicly apologised to Richard.\nIn February 2015, South Yorkshire Police announced that the inquiry into the alleged offences had increased and would be continuing. Richard released a statement maintaining that the allegations were \"absurd and untrue\". The development came a day after an independent report had concluded that South Yorkshire Police had \"interfered with the singer's privacy\" by telling the BBC about the August 2014 property search. A review by former chief constable Andy Trotter said South Yorkshire Police had breached police guidance on protecting the identity of those under investigation and the handling of the search had dented the force's reputation. The BBC's tip-off regarding the search reportedly came from within Operation Yewtree, although Crompton said he could not be certain that the leak originated from there.\nIn May 2016, South Yorkshire Police sent a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. The following month, the CPS announced that after reviewing \"evidence relating to claims of non-recent sexual offences dating between 1958 and 1983 made by four men\", there was \"insufficient evidence\" to charge Richard with an offence and that no further action against him would be taken. Richard said he was \"obviously thrilled that the vile accusations and the resulting investigation have finally been brought to a close\". He said his naming by the media, despite not being charged, meant he had been \"hung out like live bait\". South Yorkshire Police later \"apologised wholeheartedly\" to Richard after its investigation into the singer was dropped on 16 June 2016. Richard commented, \"My reputation will not be fully vindicated because the CPS's policy is to only say something general about there being 'insufficient' evidence. How can there be evidence for something that never took place?\" It was reported that during the 22-month police investigation a man was arrested over a plot to blackmail Richard. The unnamed man in his forties contacted Richard's aides and threatened to spread \"false stories\" unless he received a sum of money.\nOn 21 June 2016, the BBC apologised publicly to Richard for causing distress after the controversial broadcast. On 27 September 2016, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that the decision not to prosecute Richard over claims of historical sex offences had been upheld. The CPS reviewed the evidence following applications by two of his accusers and concluded that the decision not to charge Richard was correct. In October 2016, it was reported that Richard was suing the BBC and South Yorkshire Police. Legal papers were filed at the High Court in London on 6 October 2016. South Yorkshire Police later agreed to pay Richard \u00a3400,000 after settling a claim he brought against the force.\nOn 12 April 2018, the case against the BBC opened in the High Court. It was reported that Richard was seeking \"very substantial\" damages. On 13 April, Richard gave evidence for more than an hour, describing the television coverage as \"shocking and upsetting\". His written statement was made available online by his lawyers, Simkins LLP. On 18 July 2018, Richard won his High Court case against the BBC and was awarded \u00a3210,000 in damages. On 15 August 2018, the BBC stated they would not appeal against the judgement. The BBC repeated an apology for the distress that Richard had been through. \"The Guardian\" estimated that the BBC's costs for legal fees and damages had reached \u00a31.9\u00a0million after losing the case.\nCultural significance and impact.\nCliff Richard's 1958 hit \"Move It\" is widely regarded as the first authentic British rock and roll record, and \"laid the foundations\" for the Beatles and Merseybeat music. John Lennon reportedly said of Richard that before Cliff and the Shadows, there had been nothing worth listening to in British music. His successful performing and recording career in the UK has extended over six decades. In 2004, he was named by Channel 4 as the UK's \"ultimate pop star\", for having sold almost 21\u00a0million singles in the nation, which, at that point, was more than any other artist.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has also managed the Belgium national under-21 football team and several Belgian club sides. He played for clubs in Belgium, France and Italy, where he won several domestic titles. At international level, he was a member of the Belgium national team, for which he appeared in four FIFA World Cups, being one of three Belgian players ever to do so.\nEarly life.\nScifo was born in La Louvi\u00e8re, Wallonia, to Italian parents from Sicily. He proved himself a highly promising talent in youth football and was nicknamed \"Little Pel\u00e9\" at his local team, where he scored 432 goals in only four seasons as a junior. Scifo joined his local club R.A.A. Louvi\u00e9roise as a seven-year-old in 1973. He transferred to what used to be Belgium's most successful club, R.S.C. Anderlecht, in 1982.\nClub career.\nScifo made his first team debut with R.S.C. Anderlecht in 1983, at the age of 17. After winning three Belgian First Division championships with the club, and helping the team to the 1984 UEFA Cup Final, only to lose out to Tottenham on penalties, Scifo earned a reputation as one of the most promising young stars of his generation, and moved to his ancestral country for Internazionale in 1987 for a fee of 7.5 billion Lire. At the time, this was the record amount for a football transfer. After an unsuccessful spell in Inter Milan, which saw him manage only four league goals in 28 appearances, he moved to French club Bordeaux in 1988 where he again disappointed, and faced injuries and conflict with senior squad members. His career was revived by a successful move to Auxerre in 1989, at the age of 23, under manager Guy Roux, which led to a return to Italy with Torino in 1991; his second spell in Serie A was more successful, as he reached the 1992 UEFA Cup Final in his first season with Torino, and won the Coppa Italia the following season. Scifo then moved to AS Monaco in 1993, where he enjoyed a similar level of success and won the French championship in 1997. He returned to Anderlecht later that year and won his fourth Belgian league title in the 1999\u20132000 season. He joined Charleroi in 2000, but retired later in the same season, at the age of 36, after being diagnosed with chronic arthritis. In total, Scifo scored 121 league goals in 478 official matches.\nInternational career.\nScifo made his senior international debut on 6 June 1984 for Belgium, in a 2\u20132 friendly draw against Hungary. In Belgium's opening group match of UEFA Euro 1984, on 13 June, he attracted much publicity when he helped his team to a 2\u20130 victory over Yugoslavia; at the age of 18 years and 115 days, he was the youngest player ever to appear in the finals at the time. Scifo featured in all three of Belgium's group matches in the tournament, as they placed third in their group and suffered a first round elimination.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"\u201cHe\u2019s the only European footballer who can genuinely be considered my successor.\"\n Michel Platini on 18-year old Scifo in 1984 \nHe appeared for Belgium in the 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998 World Cups, playing sixteen games in total; he is one of only 14 players to have participated in four World Cups, and one of only three Belgian players ever to do so. Scifo helped his nation to the semi-finals of the 1986 edition of the tournament in Mexico, playing in all seven of his team's matches and scoring two goals as Belgium finished the tournament in fourth place; he was named the best young player of the tournament for his performances throughout the competition. In the 1990 edition of the tournament, held in Italy, Scifo scored a notable goal from long range in Belgium's 3-1 first round victory over Uruguay, on 17 June, held in Verona; the goal was later elected as the tenth greatest FIFA World Cup goal of the Century in a 2002 poll, with 2,935 votes. Belgium were eventually eliminated in the second round against England; four years later, at U.S.A. '94, the Belgian side were once again eliminated in the second round. Scifo retired from international football after Belgium's first round elimination in the 1998 World Cup held in France; in total he gained eighty-four international caps and scored eighteen goals.\nStyle of play.\nA highly creative midfielder with an eye for goal, Scifo was a classic number 10 playmaker who usually played as an attacking midfielder behind the strikers; he was also capable of playing as a central midfielder, where he functioned as a deep-lying playmaker, or as a wide midfielder along the right flank. Considered one of Belgium's greatest ever players, his primary traits as a footballer were his excellent vision, tactical intelligence, and technical skills, which allowed him to orchestrate his team's attacking moves from midfield; he was also highly regarded for his balance on the ball, and his ability to dribble with his head up, as well as his accurate shooting and passing ability with his right foot, which enabled him both to score goals or create chances for his teammates. However, despite his talent, he was also criticised by his managers at times for his poor defensive work-rate off the ball, his introverted character, and for being selfish and inefficient at times, in particular in his youth, as he attempted too many individual dribbling runs, rather than looking to provide a simpler pass to an open teammate. Throughout his career, his unique playing style drew comparisons with Gianni Rivera, Giancarlo Antognoni, and his idol Michel Platini.\nAfter retirement.\nScifo tried his hand at coaching with R. Charleroi S.C., joining them for the 2000\u201301 season. Indifferent results led to his resignation in June 2002. He later coached Tubize between 2004 and 2006, and later became head trainer of R.E. Mouscron, another Belgian League team, in 2007. On 6 June 2009, Scifo quit Mouscron due to the club's difficult financial situation.\nScifo returned to club football with Mons between 2012 and 2013. Between 2015 and 2016, he served as the manager of the Belgium U21 national team. Scifo was appointed manager of Mouscron in 2021, but was dismissed from his position after a poor start to the season. In 2024, Enzo Scifo was appointed talent manager of RAAL La Louvi\u00e8re, the successor club to Louvi\u00e9roise where he started as a youth player.\nCareer statistics.\nClub.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Scores and results list Belgium's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Scifo goal\".\nHonours.\nAnderlecht\nMonaco\nTorino\nBelgium\nIndividual\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52266", "revid": "5844064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52266", "title": "War of the Austrian Succession", "text": "1740\u20131748 war between European powers\nThe War of the Austrian Succession, 1740 to 1748, was a conflict between the European great powers, fought primarily in Europe, the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Related conflicts include King George's War, the War of Jenkins' Ear, the First Carnatic War, and the First and Second Silesian Wars.\nIts immediate pretext was the succession of Maria Theresa as ruler of the Habsburg monarchy, which was challenged by France, Prussia, and Bavaria. Maria Theresa was backed by Britain, the Dutch Republic, and Hanover, which were collectively known as the Pragmatic Allies. As the conflict widened, it drew in other participants such as Spain, Savoy, Saxony, Sweden, and Russia.\nThe war began when Prussia occupied the Austrian province of Silesia in 1740. By early 1748, France held most of the Austrian Netherlands, but was close to bankruptcy due to the cost of the war and a crippling British naval blockade. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle confirmed Maria Theresa in her titles but failed to resolve underlying tensions between the signatories, many of whom were unhappy with the terms. France achieved minimal gains for vast expenditure, and the Spanish gained the Duchies of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, as well as repelling a British invasion of South America.\nBritish insistence that Maria Theresa cede Silesia to make peace was deeply resented and undermined the long-standing Anglo-Austrian Alliance, while the British felt they received little benefit from the enormous subsidies paid to Austria during the war. The result was the realignment known as the Diplomatic Revolution, which ultimately led to the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in 1756.\nBackground.\nThe immediate cause of the war was the death of Emperor Charles VI in 1740 and the inheritance of the Habsburg monarchy, often collectively referred to as Austria. The 1703 Mutual Pact of Succession provided that if the Habsburgs became extinct in the male line, these possessions would go first to Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia, daughters of Emperor Joseph I, then to those of Charles, his younger brother. Since Salic law excluded women from the inheritance, this agreement required approval by the various Habsburg territories and the Imperial Diet.\nCharles had succeeded Joseph in 1711 and two years later issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, which confirmed the principle of female inheritance. However, it also modified the 1703 agreement by placing the rights of his own children first. After his first child, Maria Theresa, was born in 1717, Charles' internal and external policy was dominated by ensuring her succession ahead of his two nieces. Prior to their respective marriages to Frederick Augustus of Saxony and Charles Albert of Bavaria in 1719, both nieces were obliged to formally renounce their rights to the inheritance. Charles assumed the rivalry between Saxony and Bavaria would secure his daughter's throne, since neither would be prepared to allow the other to inherit, but instead he gave his two greatest rivals a claim to the Habsburg lands.\nCharles was also seeking to ensure the succession of Maria Theresa to not just her family lands but also to the titles and powers of the Holy Roman Emperor. Although held by a Habsburg for over 300 years, it was an elective position and could not be held by a woman. The problem was exacerbated by tensions within the Empire, caused by dramatic increases in the size and power of Bavaria, Prussia, and Saxony, mirrored by the post-1683 expansion of Habsburg power into lands previously held by the Ottoman Empire. These geopolitical tensions led to a war that reshaped the traditional European balance of power; the various legal claims were largely pretexts and seen as such.\nBavaria and Saxony refused to be bound by the decision of the Imperial Diet, while in 1738 France agreed to back Bavaria's 'just claims' despite previously accepting the Pragmatic Sanction in 1735. Attempts to offset this involved Austria in the 1733\u20131735 War of the Polish Succession and the Russo-Turkish War (1735\u20131739), and it was weakened by the losses incurred. The situation was compounded by a failure to prepare Maria Theresa for her new role, and many European statesmen were skeptical Austria could survive the contest that would follow Charles' death, which finally came in October 1740.\nStrategies.\nOn land, the fighting focused on three main theatres; Central Europe, Italy, and the Austrian Netherlands, along with a wider naval conflict. The war itself can be divided into three separate but connected conflicts, the first being the Silesian Wars between Prussia and Austria. In the second, Austria and Sardinia defeated Spanish attacks in Northern Italy, while the third featured an increasingly global contest between Britain and France. In the end, French conquest of the Austrian Netherlands gave them clear dominance on land, while Britain's victories at sea cemented its place as the dominant naval power.\nFor much of the 18th century, French military strategy focused on potential threats on its eastern and northern borders, which required a strong land army. Its colonies were left to fend for themselves, or given minimal resources, anticipating they would likely be lost anyway. This strategy was driven by a combination of geography and the superiority of the British navy, which made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to French colonies. The expectation was military victory in Europe would compensate for any colonial losses; in 1748, France recovered possessions like Louisbourg, in return for withdrawing from the Austrian Netherlands.\nThe British, as a matter of policy, tried to avoid large-scale commitments of troops on the Continent. They sought to offset the disadvantage this created in Europe by allying themselves with one or more Continental powers whose interests were antithetical to those of their enemies, particularly France. In the War of the Austrian Succession, the British were allied with Austria; by the time of the Seven Years' War, they were allied with its enemy, Prussia. In contrast to France, once Britain became engaged in the war, it took advantage of the Royal Navy to expand it into the colonies. The British pursued a dual strategy of naval blockade and bombardment of enemy ports, and also utilized their ability to move troops by sea to the utmost. They would harass enemy shipping and attack enemy outposts, frequently using colonists from nearby British colonies in the effort. This plan worked better in North America than in Europe, but set the stage for the Seven Years' War.\nCampaign of 1740.\nFrederick II succeeded his father Frederick William as king of Prussia on 31 May 1740 at the age of 28. Although Prussia had increased in importance over the prior few decades, its disparate and scattered territories limited its power, a reality Frederick intended to change. The death of Emperor Charles VI on 20 October 1740 provided him with an ideal opportunity to acquire resource-rich land in Silesia, but he needed to do so before Augustus of Saxony and Poland could pre-empt him.\nWith a population of 16\u00a0million, Austria had an authorised standing army of 157,000, although financial restraints meant its true size was considerably less than that in 1740. Since they had a much greater area to defend, their army was more of \"a sieve\" than a shield against foreign invasion. In contrast, the Prussian Army was better trained and led than its opponents, while its standing army of 80,000 was disproportionately large, at around 4% of its 2.2\u00a0million population. To add to these advantages, in April 1739 Frederick ensured Austria faced war on two fronts when Louis XV of France agreed to attack from the west, while Prussia did so from the north.\nIn early December 1740, the Prussian army assembled along the river Oder and on 16 December invaded Silesia without a formal declaration of war. Since Austrian military resources were concentrated in Hungary and Italy, they had fewer than 3,000 troops in Silesia, although this increased to 7,000 shortly before the invasion. They held on to the fortresses of Glogau, Breslau, and Brieg, but abandoned the rest of the province and withdrew into Moravia, with both sides taking up winter quarters. In under two weeks Prussia had occupied one of the richest provinces in the Holy Roman Empire, containing a population of over one million, and the commercial centre of Breslau along with mining, weaving and dyeing industries. However, Frederick underestimated Maria Theresa's determination to reverse her loss, while the retention of Austrian fortresses in Southern Silesia meant a quick victory could not be achieved.\nCampaign of 1741.\nEarly in the year, an Austrian army under von Neipperg relieved Neisse, and marched on Brzeg, and on 10 April, the two armies met at Mollwitz. Frederick made a series of mistakes in his first battle, and came so close to defeat, he left the battlefield to avoid capture. His deputy von Schwerin managed to drag out a narrow Prussian victory, both sides losing nearly 5,000 men each.\nOn 5 June, Frederick signed an alliance against Austria with France, and in August a combined Franco-Bavarian force marched along the Danube towards Vienna, capturing Linz on 14 September. Joined by a Saxon force of 20,000, they advanced on Prague from three different points, initially meeting little resistance. A hastily assembled Austrian army concentrated near T\u00e1bor, while Neipperg was recalled from Silesia to defend Vienna. \nApparently close to defeat, on 21 September Maria Theresa made an emotional speech to the Diet of Hungary, who approved the raising of additional troops, an assertion of loyalty long remembered. Her position soon improved due to deep divisions among her opponents and Frederick's own duplicity. Hoping to weaken Saxony, on 9 October he signed the Klein\u2013Schnellendorf agreement with Neipperg. In a memorable act of diplomatic subterfuge, the Austrians promptly surrendered Neisse, which under the prevailing rules of war gave the garrison unimpeded passage to the nearest friendly territory, allowing them to be used against Prussia's allies elsewhere. \nKhevenh\u00fcller incorporated these men into an army for a winter offensive to retake Upper Austria, and attack Bavaria. While Frederick completed his conquest of Silesia, the French under Maurice de Saxe took Prague on 26 November 1741, allowing the Bavarian elector, Charles Albert, to be crowned King of Bohemia, a title usually held by the emperor. The year ended with Khevenh\u00fcller advancing up the Danube towards Linz, while a second column under Johann B\u00e4renklau moved through the Tyrol, towards Munich.\nCampaign of 1742.\nOn 17 January, von Khevenh\u00fcller defeated a Bavarian army at Sch\u00e4rding while seven days later 10,000 French soldiers surrendered at Linz. On 12 February, Charles Albert of Bavaria was crowned Emperor Charles VII, the first non-Habsburg to hold the position in 300 years, although B\u00e4renklau captured Munich the same day. Although technically all allies, Prussia, Saxony and Bavaria had no desire to see France established in the Empire, nor to see one another gain relative ground. Maria Theresa ended Austria's secret truce with Frederick, first releasing the details. The Austrians assembled a second army of 28,000 to retake Prague, under Charles of Lorraine.\nNews of the secret truce badly damaged the relationship between Frederick and his allies, but Emperor Charles asked him to relieve the pressure by invading Moravia. Frederick had used the interval to reorganise his cavalry, previously neglected in favour of the infantry, and who performed poorly at Mollwitz; they would prove more effective in the 1742 campaign.\nIn December 1741, von Schwerin had captured Olm\u00fctz; Frederick took Glatz, before moving onto Gro\u00df Seelowitz in March 1742. This allowed him to threaten Vienna; a few Prussian patrols even appeared in the suburbs, before withdrawing. In early May, he took the offensive, and moved into north-east Bohemia; by 16 May, he had 10,000 infantry at Kuttenberg, and another 18,000 men under Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau a day's march behind.\nOn the afternoon of 16 May, Charles of Lorraine's cavalry ran into Leopold's rearguard. Leopold recognized he was in contact with the Austrian main force and so accelerated his march ahead to close the gap with Frederick. At 2:00\u00a0am on 17 May, his exhausted troops stopped at the small village of Chotusitz, still three hours from Kutn\u00e1 Hora. Fought later the same day, the Battle of Chotusitz was inconclusive, but technically a Prussian victory, since the Austrians withdrew. On 24 May, French Field Marshal de Broglie won a minor action at Sahay. The two victories left the strategic situation unchanged, since Charles was still able to move against Prague, while the Prussian presence in Moravia remained a threat to Vienna.\nHowever, Habsburg policy was generally to avoid fighting on too many fronts at the same time; Prussia was the most dangerous, and most difficult to defeat. Although recovering Silesia remained a priority for decades, Maria Theresa was willing to agree a temporary truce with Prussia to improve her position elsewhere. This suited Frederick, who was short of money and men and also suspected France was preparing a separate peace. In June, the Treaty of Breslau ended the First Silesian War; Prussian troops withdrew from Bohemia, and Austria recaptured Prague in December.\nCampaign of 1743.\nAt the beginning of the year, Louis XV insisted Broglie be given command of the Franco-Bavarian forces, creating tension with the Bavarians, and their general von Seckendorff. With most of his lands occupied by the Austrians, Charles VII fled to Augsburg, from where he initiated talks with Vienna and London, feeling he had been abandoned by his French allies. Divided at the top, and their troops weakened by disease, the Franco-Bavarian forces offered limited resistance to the Austrian advance; on 9 May, the Bavarians were defeated outside Simbach, by Charles of Lorraine.\nIn mid-June, the Pragmatic Army arrived at Aschaffenburg, on the north bank of the river Main. Here they were joined by George II, who was attending the enthronement of a new Elector of Mainz in Wiesbaden. By late June, the Allies were running short of supplies and withdrew towards the nearest supply depot at Hanau, the road to which ran through Dettingen, now a part of Karlstein am Main, where 23,000 French troops blocked the road. Despite a strong position, mistakes made by their commander Gramont, allowed the Allies to win a narrow victory. This was the last time a British monarch would personally lead troops in battle. \nWhile the Pragmatic Army were able to continue their retreat, they had to abandon their wounded, and although reinforced by Charles of Lorraine were unable to agree what to do next. Charles later described Allied headquarters as a 'republic', while Adrien Maurice de Noailles told Louis XV he was 'heavily indebted to the irresolutions of George II.' They ended by doing nothing, and in October, took up winter quarters in the Netherlands.\nFrederick had responded to Dettingen by renewing his search for allies, and building up his army once again. In July, the Russian court discovered an alleged plot to overthrow Empress Elizabeth, and restore three-year old Ivan VI, with his mother Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna as his regent. Whether this amounted to anything more than drunken gossip is disputed; one suggestion is that it was a fabrication by Frederick, designed to remove anti-Prussian opponents, chiefly Chancellor Bestuzhev-Ryumin.\nAnna Bestuzhev, wife of his brother Mikhail, and her friend Natalia Lopukhina, confessed to the plot after 25 days of torture; they were publicly flogged, and had their tongues removed before being exiled to Siberia. Fredrick's supporters referred to it as the \"Botta Conspiracy\", alleging the involvement of Austrian envoy Antoniotto Botta Adorno. When Tsarina Elizabeth demanded Botta be punished, Maria Theresa refused, and the episode poisoned the relationship between Austria and Russia. Frederick managed to divide his two main opponents, but Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin remained in place, leaving the overall position unchanged.\nOn 13 September, Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, Maria Theresa and Britain agreed the Treaty of Worms, intended to expel Spain from Italy. In return for Sardinian support in Lombardy, the Austrians ceded all their territories west of the river Ticino and Lake Maggiore, along with lands south of the Po. In return, Charles Emmanuel renounced his claim to the strategic Duchy of Milan, guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction, and provided 40,000 troops, paid for by Britain.\nFrance and Spain responded with the Second Pacte de Famille in October, and Louis XV began plans to invade the Austrian Netherlands. The year ended with Saxony agreeing a pact of mutual defence with Austria, leaving Prussia isolated, and facing a renewed offensive as Maria Theresa sought to regain Silesia.\nCampaign of 1744.\nUnder the 1743 Treaty of Fontainebleau, Louis XV and his uncle, Philip V of Spain agreed on joint action against Britain. This included a proposed invasion of Britain, aimed at restoring the exiled Stuarts. Over the winter, 12,000 French troops and transports were assembled at Dunkirk.\nIn the February of 1744, the Battle of Toulon, a combined Franco-Spanish fleet fought an indecisive action with a Royal Navy squadron commanded by Thomas Mathews. Although Mathews prevented them exiting the Mediterranean and supporting the invasion attempt, he was forced to retreat, which led to his dismissal. Success allowed Spain to land troops in Northern Italy, and in April they captured the important port of Villefranche-sur-Mer, then part of Savoy.\nHowever, storms sank or severely damaged many French ships, while most of Louis' ministers opposed what they considered an expensive and futile diversion of resources. The invasion was cancelled on 11 March, Louis formally declared war on Britain, and in May, a French army invaded the Austrian Netherlands. As in 1744, they were greatly helped by divisions between the Pragmatic Allies, which made it very difficult to formulate a consistent strategy. The British and Hanoverians detested each other, Austrian resources were focused on Alsace, while the Dutch were reluctant to declare war, and tried to negotiate a French withdrawal. \nWhen the latter refused, Isaac Cronstr\u00f6m argued seeking battle was the only way to protect the Barrier fortresses. However, George Wade, overall commander of Allied forces in Flanders, had strict orders from the British government not to jeopardise his connection to Ostend, or risk British or Hanoverians troops becoming prisoners of war. This was because they feared another French-backed Jacobite uprising and wanted to be able to recall their troops if needed.\nAs a result, the French made rapid progress, quickly capturing most of the Dutch-held Barrier fortresses along the border, including Menen and Ypres. When an Austrian army under Prince Charles of Lorraine invaded Alsace in early June, Louis went on the defensive in the Southern Netherlands, and travelled to Metz to meet this threat. In early August, he fell dangerously ill with smallpox, and although he later recovered, his absence temporarily paralysed the French command system.\nWith the bulk of the Austrian army occupied in Eastern France, Frederick launched the Second Silesian War on 15 August, and by the end of the month, all 80,000 of his troops were in Bohemia. Although Maria Theresa's main objective was to regain Silesia, the speed of the Prussian advance took the Austrians by surprise. On 23 August, Prince Charles withdrew from Alsace to defend Bohemia, with little interference from the French due to Louis' illness.\nBy mid-September, Frederick had captured Prague, T\u00e1bor, Budweis and Frauenberg; he now advanced up the river Moldau, hoping to catch the Austrians between his forces, and the Franco-Bavarian army he assumed was in pursuit. However, the Bavarians contented themselves with re-occupying Munich, while the French settled down to besiege Freiburg im Breisgau, a town of far less importance to Maria Theresa than Bohemia.\nFrederick was left dangerously exposed, a situation worsened in early October when Saxony joined the coalition against him as an active belligerent. Under pressure from Charles of Lorraine and a combined Austro-Saxon force under Count Traun, the Prussians were forced to retreat; by the time they entered Silesia in late November, Frederick's army was reduced to 36,000, half of whom then died of dysentery.\nDespite the surrender of Freiburg, and French advances in the Southern Netherlands, Austria seemed well-positioned at the end of 1744. Frederick's retreat damaged his reputation and weakened his army, but the most significant impact was on Franco-Prussian relations, with Louis accused of failing to support Prussia.\nIn Italy, an Austrian attack on the Kingdom of Naples was unsuccessful, largely due to the incompetence of their commanders. In the north, arguments over strategy, and Spanish accusations of French cowardice at Toulon prevented them from taking full advantage of their victories earlier in the year. This was offset by similar divisions among their opponents; Charles Emmanuel was reluctant to see the Bourbons expelled from Italy, leaving the Habsburgs as the dominant power, while his territorial ambitions could only be achieved at Austrian expense. As a result, neither side could make significant progress in this area.\nCampaign of 1745.\nFrederick's position continued to deteriorate, when on 8 January 1745, Austria, Britain, the Dutch Republic and Saxony signed the Treaty of Warsaw, which was clearly aimed at Prussia. This was accompanied by signs of Russian military activity in Livonia, followed by the death of Emperor Charles VII on 20 January. Since Maria Theresa's husband, Grand Duke Francis, was the best-supported candidate to replace him, this was a major setback for the Franco-Prussian alliance.\nCharles' son and heir, Maximilian III Joseph made one last effort to drive the Austrians out of Bavaria, but his demoralised and ill-equipped army was out-manoeuvered by Count Batthy\u00e1ny, while a Franco-Bavarian army was defeated at Pfaffenhofen on 15 April. With most of his electorate once again occupied, on 22 April he signed the Treaty of F\u00fcssen, in which he agreed to vote for Francis Stephen as Emperor, and made peace with Austria. Prussia was now isolated; attempts by Frederick to divide his opponents by supporting Frederick Augustus of Saxony for Emperor were unsuccessful, while neither Britain or Russia was willing to mediate for him with Austria.\nBavaria's exit allowed France to focus on the Low Countries, which Saxe persuaded Louis XV provided the best opportunity of defeating Britain, whose financial backing was crucial to the Pragmatic Alliance. He proposed to attack Tournai, a vital link in the trading network for Northern Europe, and strongest of the Dutch Barrier Forts, this forcing the Allies to fight on ground of his own choosing. On 11 May, he won a hard-fought victory at Fontenoy, a success that established French dominance in the Netherlands, and caused bitter disputes between the British and Dutch.\nOn 4 June, Frederick won a major victory at Hohenfriedberg, but despite this, Austria and Saxony continued the war. Prussian requests for French support were ignored; Louis had been warned by his ministers state finances were increasingly strained, making it important to focus their efforts. One area was the Netherlands, particularly after British troops were recalled to deal with the Jacobite rising of 1745. The other was Italy, where a Franco-Spanish army under Maillebois and Infante Philip defeated the Sardinians at Bassignano on 27 September, then captured Alessandria, Valenza and Casale Monferrato.\nAs a result, France made no effort to block the election of Duke Francis, who was proclaimed Emperor Francis I on 13 September. Bolstered by this significant political victory, Maria Theresa continued her attempts to regain Silesia, only to be defeated once again at the Battle of Soor on 30 September. On 15 December, Prussian victory at Kesseldorf led to the Treaty of Dresden on 25th. Under these terms, Austria accepted the loss of Silesia, Saxony paid an indemnity of one million crowns, while in return, Frederick accepted the Pragmatic Sanction, acknowledged Francis as Emperor, and evacuated Saxony.\nGermany ceased to be an active military theatre, since although Frederick knew Maria Theresa still intended to regain Silesia, both sides needed time to re-organise. French objectives were less clear; for centuries, the central plank of its foreign policy was weakening the Habsburgs, but it began the war due to concern at British commercial growth post-1713. Since the war in Italy was largely fought on behalf of Spain, this left the Netherlands as the only theatre where France could achieve strategic victory.\nAnother significant development was the start of the realignment of alliances that became the Diplomatic Revolution in 1756. Under the August 'Convention of Hanover', Frederick and George II mutually guaranteed the borders of Hanover and Prussia, and British diplomats tried to persuade Austria to end the Second Silesian War. Franco-Prussian relationships were marked by mutual distrust, while Maria Theresa resented British attempts to persuade her to accept the loss of Silesia.\nItalian Campaigns, 1741\u20131747.\nSupported by the Duke of Modena, in 1741 the Spanish and their Neapolitan allies assembled 40,000 men to capture Milan, a Spanish possession from 1556 to 1707. However, their commander Jos\u00e9 Montemar was out-manoeuvered by his Austrian counterpart von Traun, and Modena forced to make peace. \nDespite its failure, the threatened offensive led Maria Theresa to ally with Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy in the February 1742 Convention of Turin. The arrival of a British naval squadron outside Naples in August forced Montemar to detach 10,000 troops to help defend the city. This left him too weak to conduct offensive operations, and at the end of the year, he was replaced by Count Gages. On 8 February 1743, the Spanish and Austrians fought an indecisive battle at Campo Santo, the only other incident of note during the year being a skirmish outside Castelfondo in October.\nIn 1744, Spanish and French forces, usually referred to as the Gallispan army, planned an ambitious offensive aimed at conquering northern Italy, although this was hampered by personal conflicts between the respective commanders, Conti and La Mina. They crossed the Alps in June, hoping to unite with Gages on the lower Po. However, under pressure from Austrian troops led by Prince Lobkowitz, the latter withdrew towards the Neapolitan frontier, before winning the Battle of Velletri on 16/17 June.\nElsewhere, fighting continued in the north, where Gallispan troops under Conti captured Villefranche in April 1744, then entered Piedmont on 5 July. Over the next few months, Conti fought a series of battles, culminating in a major victory outside Cuneo on 30 September. However, he was unable to link up with Gages, and crossed the Alps into the Dauphin\u00e9 for the winter, leaving the Austro-Savoyard army between them. Lobkowitz was subsequently replaced by Schulenburg, while Conti switched with Maillebois. \nConcerned by the prospect of diplomatic isolation, Genoa secretly allied with France and Spain, and on 26 June 1745, declared war on Savoy. This enabled Maillebois to connect with Gages in mid-July near Tanaro, and on 27 September their combined force of around 80,000 defeated the Sardinians at Bassignano. However, Maillebois was again unable to exploit his victory, and in early 1746 Austrian troops captured Genoa, then Milan in March.. \nWith much of northern Italy under Austrian control, Maillebois retreated into Liguria, before once again linking up with his Spanish allies. Although their combined force was narrowly defeated at Piacenza on 16 June, Maillebois managed to extricate his army, then won a minor victory at Rottofreddo on 12 August. \nExhausted and short of supplies, the Austrians were driven out of Genoa in December 1746, while an attempt to retake it was abandoned in August. For different reasons, neither side was anxious to continue fighting, and last significant military action was a French defeat at Assietta in July 1747.\nThe Low Countries, 1745\u20131748.\nThe Dutch, British and Austrians withdrew from Fontenoy in good order but Tournai was lost, while Ghent, Oudenaarde, Bruges, and Dendermonde soon followed. By the end of July, the French stood on the threshold of Dutch Flanders, the south-western corner of the Dutch Republic. In August, the French-backed Jacobite rising forced the British to transfer troops from Flanders allowing the French to seize Ostend and Nieuwpoort, threatening Britain's links to mainland Europe.\nDuring 1746, the French continued their advance into the Austrian Netherlands, taking Antwerp and then clearing Dutch and Austrian forces from the area between Brussels and the Meuse. After defeating the Jacobite Rebellion at Culloden in April, the British launched a diversionary raid on Lorient in an unsuccessful attempt to divert French forces, while the new Austrian commander, Prince Charles of Lorraine, was defeated by Saxe at the Battle of Rocoux in October.\nThe Dutch Republic itself was now in danger. In April 1747, the French began reducing the Barrier Fortresses along the border with the Austrian Netherlands and invaded Dutch Flanders, which they swiftly captured. This prompted an Orangist revolution, which resulted in the appointment of William IV, Prince of Orange as stadtholder and head of the Dutch military. The strategic situation, however, failed to change and at Lauffeld on 2 July 1747, Saxe won another victory over a British and Dutch army under the Prince of Waldeck and Cumberland; the French then besieged Maastricht and Bergen op Zoom, which fell in September. Although the Dutch States Navy was in the poorest condition it had ever been in, its positioning in the estuaries and rivers of Zeeland and Holland, however, prevented French incursions into those provinces.\nThe French advance lent greater urgency to ongoing peace talks at the Congress of Breda, which took place to the sound of French artillery firing on Maastricht. Following their 1746 alliance with Austria, an army of 30,000 Russians marched from Livonia to the Rhine, but arrived too late to be of use. Maastricht surrendered on 7 May and on 18 October 1748, the war ended with the signing of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle.\nThe Peace of 1748.\nNegotiations between Britain and France had been taking place at Breda since June 1746; the terms they agreed were then imposed on the other parties at Aix-la-Chapelle. Despite their victories in Flanders, French Finance Minister Machault repeatedly warned of the impending collapse of their financial system. The British naval blockade led to the collapse of French customs receipts and caused severe food shortages, especially among the poor; after Cape Finisterre in October, the French Navy could no longer protect their colonies or trade routes.This was followed in November by a convention between Britain and Russia; in February 1748, a Russian corps of 37,000 arrived in the Rhineland. Although the Dutch city of Maastricht surrendered to French forces in May 1748, ending the war was increasingly urgent. Louis XV therefore agreed to return the Austrian Netherlands, whose acquisition had cost so much. Few of his countrymen understood this decision; combined with the lack of tangible benefits for helping Prussia, it led to the phrase \"as stupid as the Peace\".\nA commission to negotiate competing territorial claims in North America was set up, but made very little progress. Britain regained Madras, in return for restoring Louisbourg, in Nova Scotia, much to the fury of British colonists. Neither of the two main protagonists appeared to have gained much for their investment and both viewed the Treaty as an armistice, not a peace.\nIn Austria, reactions were mixed; Maria Theresa was determined to regain Silesia and resented British support for Prussia's occupation. On the other hand, the Treaty confirmed her right to the Monarchy, while the Habsburgs had survived a potentially disastrous crisis, regained the Austrian Netherlands without fighting and made only minor concessions in Italy. Administrative and financial reforms made it stronger in 1750 than 1740, while its strategic position was strengthened through installing Habsburg allies as rulers of key territories in Northwest Germany, the Rhineland and Northern Italy.\nOf the other combatants, Spain retained its predominance in Spanish America and made minor gains in Northern Italy, gaining the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza for Infante Philip. With French support, Prussia doubled in size with the acquisition of Silesia but twice made peace without informing their ally; Louis XV already disliked Frederick and now viewed him as untrustworthy. In the Dutch Republic the signing of the peace terms, the elevation of the Prince of Orange and the birth of his son caused great joy, but dissatisfaction towards the ruling regime remained. William IV had changed little, did not reckon with his political opponents and, like them, was accused of French sympathies. Many began to think that improvements would not be obtained unless they were violently demanded; and so riots arose. The war confirmed the decline of the Dutch Republic, and the dismantlement of the Barrier fortresses marked the end of its period as a great power; combined with a sense they received little value for the subsidies paid to Maria Theresa, Britain moved to align itself with Prussia, rather than Austria, in order to protect Hanover from French aggression.\nThese factors led to the realignment known as the 1756 Diplomatic Revolution and the 1756 to 1763 Seven Years' War, which was even grander in scale than its predecessor.\nNorth America.\nThe war was also conducted in North America and India. In North America the conflict was known in the British colonies as King George's War, and did not begin until after formal war declarations of France and Britain reached the colonies in May 1744. The frontiers between New France and the British colonies of New England, New York, and Nova Scotia were the site of frequent small scale raids, primarily by French colonial troops and their Indian allies against British targets, although several attempts were made by British colonists to organise expeditions against New France. The most significant incident was the capture of the French Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island (\u00cele Royale) by an expedition (29 April\u00a0\u2013 16 June 1745) of colonial militia organised by Massachusetts Governor William Shirley, commanded by William Pepperrell of Maine (then part of Massachusetts), and assisted by a Royal Navy fleet. A French expedition to recover Louisbourg in 1746 failed due to bad weather, disease, and the death of its commander. Louisbourg was returned to France in exchange for Madras, generating much anger among the British colonists, who felt they had eliminated a nest of privateers with its capture.\nIndia.\nThe war marked the beginning of a powerful struggle between Britain and France in India and of European military ascendancy and political intervention in the subcontinent. Major hostilities began with the arrival of a naval squadron under Mah\u00e9 de la Bourdonnais, carrying troops from France. In September 1746 Bourdonnais landed his troops near Madras and laid siege to the port. Although it was the main British settlement in the Carnatic, Madras was weakly fortified and had only a small garrison, reflecting the thoroughly commercial nature of the European presence in India hitherto. On 20 September, only six days after the arrival of the French force, Madras surrendered after a brief bombardment. The terms of the surrender agreed by Bourdonnais provided for the settlement to be ransomed back for a cash payment by the British East India Company. However, this concession was opposed by Dupleix, the governor general of the Indian possessions of the Compagnie des Indes. When Bourdonnais was forced to leave India in October after the devastation of his squadron by a cyclone Dupleix reneged on the agreement. The Nawab of the Carnatic Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan intervened in support of the British and advanced to retake Madras, but despite vast superiority in numbers his army was defeated by the French at the Battle of Adyar, one of the earliest demonstrations in the gap in quality that had opened up between European and Indian armies.\nThe French now turned to the remaining British settlement in the Carnatic, Fort St. David at Cuddalore, which was dangerously close to the main French settlement of Pondich\u00e9ry. The first French force sent against Cuddalore was surprised and defeated nearby by the forces of the Nawab and the British garrison in December 1746. Early in 1747 a second expedition laid siege to Fort St David but withdrew on the arrival of a British naval squadron in March. A final attempt in June 1748 avoided the fort and attacked the weakly fortified town of Cuddalore itself, but was routed by the British garrison.\nWith the arrival of a naval squadron under Admiral Edward Boscawen, carrying troops and artillery, the British went on the offensive, laying siege to Pondich\u00e9ry. They enjoyed a considerable superiority in numbers over the defenders, but the settlement had been heavily fortified by Dupleix and after two months the siege was abandoned.\nThe peace settlement brought the return of Madras to the British company, exchanged for Louisbourg in Canada. However, the conflict between the two companies continued by proxy during the interval before the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, with British and French forces fighting on behalf of rival claimants to the thrones of Hyderabad and the Carnatic.\nNaval operations.\nThe naval operations of this war were entangled with the War of Jenkins' Ear, which broke out in 1739 in consequence of the long disputes between Britain and Spain over their conflicting claims in America. The war was remarkable for the prominence of privateering on both sides. It was carried on by the Spaniards in the West Indies with great success, and actively at home. The French were no less active in all seas. Mah\u00e9 de la Bourdonnais's attack on Madras partook largely of the nature of a privateering venture. The British retaliated with vigour. The total number of captures by French and Spanish corsairs was in all probability larger than the list of British\u2014as the French wit Voltaire drolly put it upon hearing his government's boast, namely, that more British merchants were taken because there were many more British merchant ships to take; but partly also because the British government had not yet begun to enforce the use of convoy so strictly as it did in later times.\nWest Indies.\nWar on Spain was declared by Great Britain on 23 October 1739, which has become known as the War of Jenkins' Ear. A plan was laid for combined operations against the Spanish colonies from east and west. One force, military and naval, was to assault them from the West Indies under Admiral Edward Vernon. Another, to be commanded by Commodore George Anson, afterwards Lord Anson, was to round Cape Horn and to fall upon the Pacific coast of Latin America. Delays, bad preparations, dockyard corruption, and the squabbles of the naval and military officers concerned caused the failure of a hopeful scheme. On 21 November 1739, Admiral Vernon did, however, succeed in capturing the ill-defended Spanish harbour of Porto Bello in present-day Panama. When Vernon had been joined by Sir Chaloner Ogle with massive naval reinforcements and a strong body of troops, an attack was made on Cartagena de Indias in what is now Colombia (9 March\u00a0\u2013 24 April 1741). The delay had given the Spanish under Sebasti\u00e1n de Eslava and Blas de Lezo time to prepare. After two months of skilful defence by the Spanish, the British attack finally succumbed to a massive outbreak of disease and withdrew having suffered a dreadful loss of lives and ships.\nThe war in the West Indies, after two other unsuccessful attacks had been made on Spanish territory, died down and did not revive until 1748. The expedition under Anson sailed late, was very ill-provided, and less strong than had been intended. It consisted of six ships and left Britain on 18 September 1740. Anson returned alone with his flagship the \"Centurion\" on 15 June 1744. The other vessels had either failed to round the Horn or had been lost. But Anson had harried the coast of Chile and Peru and had captured a Spanish galleon of immense value near the Philippines, completing a circumnavigation of the world. His cruise was a great feat of resolution and endurance.\nAfter the failure of the British invasions and a Spanish counter invasion of Georgia in 1742, belligerent naval actions in the Caribbean were left to the privateers of both sides. Fearing great financial and economic losses should a treasure fleet be captured, the Spanish reduced the risk by increasing the number of convoys, thereby reducing their value. They also increased the number of ports they visited and reduced the predictability of their voyages.\nIn 1744, a British force of 300 men accompanied by two privateers from Saint Kitts successfully captured the French half of neighbouring Saint Martin, occupying it until the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In late May 1745 two French royal frigates of 36 and 30 guns respectively under Commodore La Touch\u00e9, plus three privateers in retaliation sailed from Martinique to invade and capture the British colony of Anguilla but were repelled with heavy loss in the Battle of Anguilla.\nThe last year of the war saw two significant actions in the Caribbean. A second British assault on Santiago de Cuba which also ended in failure and a naval action which arose from an accidental encounter between two convoys. The action unfolded in a confused way with each side at once anxious to cover its own trade and to intercept that of the other. Capture was rendered particularly desirable for the British by the fact that the Spanish homeward-bound fleet would be laden with bullion from the American mines. The advantage lay with the British when one Spanish warship ran aground and another was captured but the British commander failed to capitalise and the Spanish fleet took shelter in Havana.\nMediterranean.\nWhile Anson was pursuing his voyage round the world, Spain was mainly intent on the Italian policy of the king. A squadron was fitted out at C\u00e1diz to convey troops to Italy. It was watched by the British admiral Nicholas Haddock. When the blockading squadron was forced off by want of provisions, the Spanish admiral Don Juan Jos\u00e9 Navarro put to sea. He was followed, but when the British force came in sight of him Navarro had been joined by a French squadron under Claude-\u00c9lis\u00e9e de Court de La Bruy\u00e8re (December 1741). The French admiral told Haddock that he would support the Spaniards if they were attacked and Haddock retired. France and Great Britain were not yet openly at war, but both were engaged in the struggle in Germany\u2014Great Britain as the ally of the Queen of Hungary, Maria Theresa; France as the supporter of the Bavarian claimant of the empire. Navarro and de Court went on to Toulon, where they remained until February 1744. A British fleet watched them, under the command of Admiral Richard Lestock, until Sir Thomas Mathews was sent out as commander-in-chief and as Minister to the Court of Turin.\nSporadic manifestations of hostility between the French and British took place in different seas, but avowed war did not begin until the French government issued its declaration of 30 March, to which Great Britain replied on 31 March. This formality had been preceded by French preparations for the invasion of England, and by the Battle of Toulon between the British and a Franco-Spanish fleet. On 11 February, a most confused battle was fought, in which the van and centre of the British fleet was engaged with the Spanish rear and centre of the allies. Lestock, who was on the worst possible terms with his superior, took no part in the action. Mathews fought with spirit but in a disorderly way, breaking the formation of his fleet, and showing no power of direction, while Navarro's smaller fleet retained cohesion and fought off the energetic but confused attacks of its larger enemy until the arrival of the French fleet forced the heavily damaged British fleet to withdraw. The Spanish fleet then sailed to Italy where it delivered a fresh army and supplies that had a decisive impact upon the war. The mismanagement of the British fleet in the battle, by arousing deep anger among the people, led to a drastic reform of the British navy.\nNorthern waters.\nThe French scheme to invade Britain was arranged in combination with the Jacobite leaders, and soldiers were to be transported from Dunkirk. In February 1744, a French fleet of twenty sail of the line entered the English Channel under Jacques Aymar, comte de Roquefeuil, before the British force under Admiral John Norris was ready to oppose him. But the French force was ill-equipped, the admiral was nervous, his mind dwelt on all the misfortunes which might possibly happen, and the weather was bad. De Roquefeuil came up almost as far as The Downs, where he learnt that Sir John Norris was at hand with twenty-five sail of the line, and thereupon precipitately retreated. The military expedition prepared at Dunkirk to cross under cover of De Roquefeuil's fleet naturally did not start. The utter weakness of the French at sea, due to long neglect of the fleet and the bankrupt state of the treasury, was shown during the Jacobite rising of 1745, when France made no attempt to profit by the distress of the British government.\nThe Dutch, having by this time joined Great Britain, made a serious addition to the naval power opposed to France, though the Dutch Republic was compelled by the necessity for maintaining an army in Flanders to play a very subordinate part at sea. Not being stimulated by formidable attack, and having immediate interests both at home and in Germany, the British government was slow to make use of its latest naval strength. Spain, which could do nothing of an offensive character, was almost neglected. During 1745 the New England expedition which took Louisburg (30 April\u00a0\u2013 16 June) was covered by a British naval force, but little else was accomplished by the naval efforts of any of the belligerents.\nIn 1746, a British combined naval and military expedition to the coast of France\u2014the first of a long series of similar ventures which in the end were derided as \"breaking windows with guineas\"\u2014was carried out during August and October. The aim was the capture of the French East India Company's dockyard at Lorient, but it was not attained.\nFrom 1747 until the close of the war in October 1748, the naval policy of the British government, without reaching a high level, was more energetic and coherent. A closer watch was kept on the French coast, and effectual means were taken to intercept communication between France and her American possessions. In the spring information was obtained that an important convoy for the East and West Indies was to sail from Lorient. The convoy was intercepted by Anson on 3 May, and in the First Battle of Cape Finisterre, British admiral George Anson's fourteen ships of the line wiped out the French escort of six ships of the line and three armed Indiamen, although in the meantime the merchant ships escaped.\nOn 14 October, another French convoy, protected by a strong squadron, was intercepted by a well-appointed and well-directed squadron of superior numbers\u2014the squadrons were respectively eight French and fourteen British\u2014in the Bay of Biscay. In the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre which followed, the French admiral, Henri-Fran\u00e7ois des Herbiers, Marquis de l'Estendu\u00e8re, succeeded in covering the escape of most of the merchant ships, but Hawke's British squadron took six of his warships. Most of the merchantmen were later intercepted and captured in the West Indies. This disaster convinced the French government of its helplessness at sea, and it made no further effort.\nIndian Ocean.\nIn the East Indies, attacks on French commerce by a British squadron under Curtis Barnett in 1745 led to the despatch of a French squadron commanded by Mah\u00e9 de la Bourdonnais. After an inconclusive clash off Negapatnam in July 1746, Edward Peyton, Barnett's successor, withdrew to Bengal, leaving Bourdonnais unopposed on the Coromandel Coast. He landed troops near Madras and besieged the port by land and sea, forcing it to surrender on 10 September 1746. In October the French squadron was devastated by a cyclone, losing four ships of the line and suffering heavy damage to four more, and the surviving ships withdrew. French land forces went on to make several attacks on the British settlement at Cuddalore, but the eventual replacement of the negligent Peyton by Thomas Griffin resulted in a return to British naval supremacy which put the French on the defensive. Despite the appearance of another French squadron, the arrival of large-scale British reinforcements under Edward Boscawen (who considered but did not make an attack on \u00cele de France on the way) gave the British overwhelming dominance on land and sea, but the ensuing siege of Pondich\u00e9ry organised by Boscawen was unsuccessful.\nMilitary methods and technologies.\nEuropean warfare in the early modern period was characterised by the widespread adoption of firearms in combination with more traditional bladed weapons. Eighteenth-century European armies were built around units of massed infantry armed with smoothbore flintlock muskets and bayonets. Cavalrymen were equipped with sabres and pistols or carbines; light cavalry were used principally for reconnaissance, screening and tactical communications, while heavy cavalry were used as tactical reserves and deployed for shock attacks. Smoothbore artillery provided fire support and played the leading role in siege warfare. Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key fortifications positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict. Decisive field battles were relatively rare, though they played a larger part in Frederick's theory of warfare than was typical among his contemporary rivals.\nThe War of the Austrian Succession, like most European wars of the eighteenth century, was fought as a so-called cabinet war in which disciplined regular armies were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign's interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century. Military logistics was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised magazines and distributed by baggage trains that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids. Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established winter quarters in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52268", "revid": "18367523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52268", "title": "Sabra and Shatila massacre", "text": "1982 mass murder of civilians in Beirut, Lebanon\nThe Sabra and Shatila massacre was the 16\u201318 September 1982 killing of between 1,300 and 3,500 civilians\u2014mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shias\u2014in the city of Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War. It was perpetrated by the Lebanese Forces, one of the main Christian militias in Lebanon, and supported by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that had surrounded Beirut's Sabra neighbourhood and the adjacent Shatila refugee camp.\nIn June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon with the intention of rooting out the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). By 30 August 1982, under the supervision of the Multinational Force, the PLO withdrew from Lebanon following weeks of battles in West Beirut and shortly before the massacre took place. The Lebanese president Bashir Gemayel banned the Lebanese Forces from operating in Beirut, replacing their positions with the Lebanese army. On 11 September 1982, the multinational force withdrew from Lebanon, and the Lebanese army entered parts of West Beirut to restore civil order but did not enter the Palestinian camps. Various forces\u2014Israeli, Lebanese Forces and possibly also the South Lebanon Army (SLA)\u2014were in the vicinity of Sabra and Shatila at the time of the slaughter, taking advantage of the fact that the Multinational Force had removed barracks and mines that had encircled Beirut's predominantly Muslim neighborhoods and kept the Israelis at bay during the siege of Beirut. On the 14th of September, Bashir was assassinated by an SSNP militant under the orders of the Syrian regime, and taking advantage of the power vacuum Israel occupied west Beirut the following day. The Israeli advance over West Beirut in the wake of the PLO withdrawal, which enabled the Lebanese Forces raid, was in violation of the ceasefire agreement between the various forces.\nThe killings are widely believed to have taken place under the command of Lebanese politician Elie Hobeika, whose family and fianc\u00e9e had been murdered by Palestinian militants and left-wing Lebanese militias during the Damour massacre in 1976, itself a response to the Karantina massacre of Palestinians and Lebanese Shias at the hands of Christian militias. In total, between 300 and 400 militiamen were involved in the massacre, including some from the South Lebanon Army. As the massacre unfolded, the IDF received reports of atrocities being committed, but did not take any action to stop it. Instead, Israeli troops were stationed at the exits of the area to prevent the camp's residents from leaving and, at the request of the Lebanese Forces, shot flares to illuminate Sabra and Shatila through the night during the massacre.\nIn February 1983, an independent commission chaired by Irish diplomat Se\u00e1n MacBride, assistant to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, concluded that the IDF, as the then occupying power over Sabra and Shatila, bore responsibility for the militia's massacre. The commission also stated that the massacre was a form of genocide. And in February 1983, the Israeli Kahan Commission found that Israeli military personnel had failed to take serious steps to stop the killings despite being aware of the militia's actions, and deemed that the IDF was indirectly responsible for the events, and forced erstwhile Israeli defense minister Ariel Sharon to resign from his position \"for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge\" during the massacre.\nBackground.\nLebanese Civil War and Israeli-PLO skirmishes.\nFrom 1975 to 1990, groups in competing alliances with neighboring countries fought against each other in the Lebanese Civil War. Infighting and massacres between these groups claimed several thousand victims. Examples: the Syrian-backed Karantina massacre (January 1976) by the Kataeb and its allies against Kurds, Syrians and Palestinians in the predominantly Muslim slum district of Beirut; the Damour massacre (January 1976) by the PLO against Christian Maronites, including the family and fianc\u00e9e of the Lebanese Forces intelligence chief Elie Hobeika; and the Tel al-Zaatar massacre (August 1976) by Phalangists and their allies against Palestinian refugees living in a camp administered by UNRWA. The total death toll in Lebanon for the whole civil war period was around 150,000 victims.\nAs the civil war unfolded, Israel and the PLO had been exchanging attacks since the early 1970s until early 1980s.\nThe casus belli cited by the Israeli side to declare war, however, was an assassination attempt, on 3 June 1982, made upon Israeli Ambassador to Britain Shlomo Argov. The attempt was the work of the Iraq-based Abu Nidal, possibly with Syrian or Iraqi involvement. Historians and observers such as David Hirst and Benny Morris have commented that the PLO could not have been involved in the assault, or even approved of it, as Abu Nidal's group was a bitter rival to Arafat's PLO and even murdered some of its members. The PLO issued a condemnation of the attempted assassination of the Israeli ambassador. Nonetheless, Israel used the event as a justification to break the ceasefire with the PLO, and as a casus belli for a full-scale invasion of Lebanon.\nPost-war assessment.\nAfter the war, Israel presented its actions as a response to terrorism being carried out by the PLO from several fronts, including the border with Lebanon. However, these historians have argued that the PLO was respecting the ceasefire agreement then in force with Israel and keeping the border between the Jewish state and Lebanon more stable than it had been for over a decade. During that ceasefire, which lasted eight months, the UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon UNIFIL reported that the PLO had launched not a single act of provocation against Israel. The Israeli government tried out several justifications to ditch the ceasefire and attack the PLO, even eliciting accusations from the Israeli opposition that \"demagogy\" from the government threatened to pull Israel into war. Before the attempted assassination of the ambassador, all such justifications had been shot down by its ally, the United States, as an insufficient reason to launch a war against the PLO.\nOn 6 June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon moving northwards to surround the capital, Beirut. Following an extended siege of the city, the fighting was brought to an end with a U.S.-brokered agreement between the parties on 21 August 1982, which allowed for safe evacuation of the Palestinian fighters from the city under the supervision of Western nations and guaranteed the protection of refugees and the civilian residents of the refugee camps.\nOn 15 June 1982, 10 days after the start of the invasion, the Israeli Cabinet passed a proposal put forward by the Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, that the IDF should not enter West Beirut but this should be done by Lebanese Forces. Chief of Staff, Rafael Eitan, had already issued orders that the Lebanese predominantly Christian, right-wing militias should not take part in the fighting and the proposal was to counter public complaints that the IDF were suffering casualties whilst their allies were standing by. The subsequent Israeli inquiry estimated the strength of militias in West Beirut, excluding Palestinians, to be around 7,000. They estimated the Lebanese Forces to be 5,000 when fully mobilized of whom 2,000 were full-time.\nOn 23 August 1982, Bachir Gemayel, leader of the right-wing Lebanese Forces, was elected President of Lebanon by the National Assembly. Israel had relied on Gemayel and his forces as a counterbalance to the PLO, and as a result, ties between Israel and Maronite groups, from which hailed many of the supporters of the Lebanese Forces, had grown stronger.\nBy 1 September, the PLO fighters had been evacuated from Beirut under the supervision of Multinational Force. The evacuation was conditional on the continuation of the presence of the Multinational Force in Lebanon (MNF) to provide security for the community of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Two days later the Israeli Premier Menachem Begin met Gemayel in Nahariya and strongly urged him to sign a peace treaty with Israel. Begin also wanted the continuing presence of the SLA in southern Lebanon (Haddad supported peaceful relations with Israel) in order to control attacks and violence, and action from Gemayel to move on the PLO fighters which Israel believed remained a hidden threat in Lebanon. However, the Phalangists, who were previously united as reliable Israeli allies, were now split because of developing alliances with Syria, which remained militarily hostile to Israel. As such, Gemayel rejected signing a peace treaty with Israel and did not authorize operations to root out the remaining PLO militants.\nOn 11 September 1982, the international forces that were guaranteeing the safety of Palestinian refugees left Beirut. Then on 14 September, Gemayel was assassinated in a massive explosion which demolished his headquarters. Eventually, the culprit, Habib Tanious Shartouni, a Lebanese Christian, confessed to the crime. He turned out to be a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party and an agent of Syrian intelligence. Palestinian and Lebanese Muslim leaders denied any connection to him.\nOn the evening of 14 September, following the news that Bachir Gemayel had been assassinated, Prime Minister Begin, Defense Minister Sharon and Chief of Staff Eitan agreed that the Israeli army should invade West Beirut. The public reason given was to be that they were there to prevent chaos. In a separate conversation, at 20:30 that evening, Sharon and Eitan agreed that the IDF should not enter the Palestinian refugee camps but that the Phalange should be used. The only other member of the cabinet who was consulted was Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Shortly after 6.00\u00a0am 15 September, the Israeli army entered West Beirut, This Israeli action breached its agreement with the United States not to occupy West Beirut and was in violation of the ceasefire.\nFawwaz Traboulsi writes that while the massacre was presented as a reaction to the assassination of Bachir, it represented the posthumous achievement of his \"radical solution\" to Palestinians in Lebanon, who he thought of as \"people too many\" in the region. Later, the Israeli army's monthly journal \"Skira Hodechith\" wrote that the Lebanese Forces hoped to provoke \"the general exodus of the Palestinian population\" and aimed to create a new demographic balance in Lebanon favouring the Christians.\nAttack.\nLead-up events.\nOn the night of 14/15 September 1982 the IDF chief of staff Raphael Eitan flew to Beirut where he went straight to the Phalangists' headquarters and instructed their leadership to order a general mobilisation of their forces and prepare to take part in the forthcoming Israeli attack on West Beirut. He also ordered them to impose a general curfew on all areas under their control and appoint a liaison officer to be stationed at the IDF forward command post. He told them that the IDF would not enter the refugee camps but that this would be done by the Phalangist forces. The militia leaders responded that the mobilisation would take them 24 hours to organise.\nOn morning of Wednesday 15 September Israeli Defence Minister, Sharon, who had also travelled to Beirut, held a meeting with Eitan at the IDF's forward command post, on the roof of a five-storey building 200 metres southwest of Shatila camp. Also in attendance were Sharon's aide Avi Duda'i, the Director of Military Intelligence -Yehoshua Saguy, a senior Mossad officer, General Amir Drori, General Amos Yaron, an Intelligence officer, the Head of GSS\u2014Avraham Shalom, the Deputy Chief of Staff\u2014General Moshe Levi and other senior officers. It was agreed that the Phalange should go into the camps. According to the Kahan Commission report throughout Wednesday, R.P.G. and light-weapons fire from the Sabra and Shatila camps was directed at this forward command post, and continued to a lesser degree on Thursday and Friday (16\u201317 September). It also added that by Thursday morning, the fighting had ended and all was 'calm and quiet'.\nFollowing the assassination of Lebanese Christian President Bachir Gemayel, the Phalangists sought revenge. By noon on 15 September, Sabra and Shatila had been surrounded by the IDF, which set up checkpoints at the exits and entrances, and used several multi-story buildings as observation posts. Amongst them was the seven-story Kuwaiti embassy which, according to \"Time\" magazine, had \"an unobstructed and panoramic view\" of Sabra and Shatila. Hours later, IDF tanks began shelling Sabra and Shatila.\nThe following morning, 16 September, the sixth IDF order relating to the attack on West Beirut was issued. It specified: \"The refugee camps are not to be entered. Searching and mopping up the camps will be done by the Phalangists/Lebanese Army\".\nAccording to Linda Malone of the Jerusalem Fund, Ariel Sharon and Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan met with Phalangist militia units and invited them to enter Sabra and Shatila, claiming that the PLO was responsible for Gemayel's assassination. The meeting concluded at 15:00 on 16 September.\nShatila had previously been one of the PLO's three main training camps for foreign fighters and the main training camp for European fighters. The Israelis maintained that 2,000 to 3,000 terrorists remained in the camps, but were unwilling to risk the lives of more of their soldiers after the Lebanese army repeatedly refused to \"clear them out.\" No evidence was offered for this claim. There were only a small number of forces sent into the camps and they suffered minimal casualties. Two Phalangists were wounded, one in the leg and another in the hand. Investigations after the massacre found few weapons in the camps. Thomas Friedman, who entered the camps on Saturday, mostly found groups of young men with their hands and feet bound, who had been then lined up and machine-gunned down gang-land style, not typical he thought of the kind of deaths the reported 2,000 terrorists in the camp would have put up with.\nMassacre.\nAn hour later, 1,500 militiamen assembled at Beirut International Airport, then occupied by Israel. Under the command of Elie Hobeika, they began moving towards the area in IDF-supplied jeeps, some bearing weapons provided by Israel, following Israeli guidance on how to enter it. The forces were mostly Phalangist, though there were some men from Saad Haddad's \"Free Lebanon forces\". According to Ariel Sharon and Elie Hobeika's bodyguard, the Phalangists were given \"harsh and clear\" warnings about harming civilians. However, it was by then known that the Phalangists presented a special security risk for Palestinians. It was published in the edition of 1 September of \"Bamahane\", the IDF newspaper, that a Phalangist told an Israeli official: \"[T]he question we are putting to ourselves is\u2014how to begin, by raping or killing?\" A US envoy to the Middle East expressed horror after being told of Sharon's plans to send the Phalangists inside the camps, and Israeli officials themselves acknowledged the situation could trigger \"relentless slaughter\".\nThe first unit of 150 Phalangists entered Sabra and Shatila at sunset on Thursday, 16 September. They entered the homes of the camp residents and began shooting and raping them, often taking groups outside and lining them up for execution. During the night, the Israeli forces fired illuminating flares over the area. According to a Dutch nurse, the camp was as bright as \"a sports stadium during a football game\".\nAt 19:30, the Israeli Cabinet convened and was informed that the Phalangist commanders had been informed that their men must participate in the operation and fight, and enter the extremity of Sabra, while the IDF would guarantee the success of their operation though not participate in it. The Phalangists were to go in there \"with their own methods\". After Gemayel's assassination there were two possibilities, either the Phalange would collapse or they would undertake revenge, having killed Druze for that reason earlier that day. With regard to this second possibility, it was noted, 'it will be an eruption the likes of which has never been seen; I can already see in their eyes what they are waiting for.' 'Revenge' was what Bachir Gemayel's brother had called for at the funeral earlier. Levy commented: 'the Phalangists are already entering a certain neighborhood\u2014and I know what the meaning of revenge is for them, what kind of slaughter. Then no one will believe we went in to create order there, and we will bear the blame. Therefore, I think that we are liable here to get into a situation in which we will be blamed, and our explanations will not stand up ...\" The press release that followed reads:\nIn the wake of the assassination of the President-elect Bashir Jemayel, the I.D.F. has seized positions in West Beirut in order to forestall the danger of violence, bloodshed and chaos, as some 2,000 terrorists, equipped with modern and heavy weapons, have remained in Beirut, in flagrant violation of the evacuation agreement.\nAn Israeli intelligence officer present in the forward post, wishing to obtain information about the Phalangists' activities, ordered two distinct actions to find out what was happening. The first failed to turn up anything. The second resulted in a report at 20:00 from the roof, stated that the Phalangists' liaison officer had heard from an operative inside the camp that he held 45 people and asked what he should do with him. The liaison officer told him to more or less \"Do the will of God.\" The Intelligence Officer received this report at approximately 20:00 from the person on the roof who heard the conversation. He did not pass on the report.\nAt roughly the same time or a little earlier at 19:00, Lieutenant Elul testified that he had overheard a radio conversation between one of the militia men in the camp and his commander Hobeika in which the former asking what he was to do with 50 women and children who had been taken prisoner. Hobeika's reply was: \"This is the last time you're going to ask me a question like that; you know exactly what to do.\" Other Phalangists on the roof started laughing. Amongst the Israelis there was Brigadier General Yaron, Divisional Commander, who asked Lieutenant Elul, his Chef de Bureau, what the laughter was about; Elul translated what Hobeika had said. Yaron then had a five-minute conversation, in English, with Hobeika. What was said is unknown.\nThe Kahan Commission determined that the evidence pointed to 'two different and separate reports', noting that Yaron maintained that he thought they referred to the same incident, and that it concerned 45 \"dead terrorists\". At the same time, 20:00, a third report came in from liaison officer G. of the Phalangists who in the presence of numerous Israeli officers, including general Yaron, in the dining room, stated that within 2 hours the Phalangists had killed 300 people, including civilians. He returned sometime later and changed the number from 300 to 120.\nAt 20:40, General Yaron held a briefing, and after it the Divisional Intelligence Officer stated that it appeared no terrorists were in the Shatila camp, and that the Phalangists were in two minds as to what to do with the women, children and old people they had massed together, either to lead them somewhere else or that they were told, as the liaison officer was overheard saying, to 'do what your heart tells you, because everything comes from God.' Yaron interrupted the officer and said he'd checked and that 'they have no problems at all,' and that with regard to the people, 'It will not, will not harm them.' Yaron later testified he had been sceptical of the reports and had in any case told the Phalangists not to harm civilians. At 21:00 Maj. Amos Gilad predicted during a discussion at Northern Command that, rather than a cleansing of terrorists, what would take place was a massacre, informing higher commanders that already between 120 and 300 had already been killed by that time.\nAt 23:00 the same evening, a report was sent to the IDF headquarters in East Beirut, reporting the killings of 300 people, including civilians. The report was forwarded to headquarters in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and to the office of the Bureau Chief of the director of Military Intelligence, Lt. Col. Hevroni, at 05:30 the following day where it was seen by more than 20 senior Israeli officers. It was then forwarded to his home by 06:15. That same morning an IDF historian copied down a note, which later disappeared, which he had found in the Northern Command situation room in Aley.\nDuring the night the Phalangists entered the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps. Even though it was agreed that they would not harm civilians, they 'butchered.' They did not operate in orderly fashion but dispersed. They had casualties, including two killed. They will organize to operate in a more orderly manner\u2014we will see to it that they are moved into the area.\"\nEarly on that morning, between 08:00 and 09:00, several IDF soldiers stationed nearby noted killings were being conducted against the camp refugees. A deputy tank commander some away, Lieutenant Grabowski, saw two Phalangists beating two young men, who were then taken back into the camp, after which shots rang out, and the soldiers left. Sometime later, he saw the Phalangists had killed a group of five women and children. When he expressed a desire to make report, the tank crew said they had already heard a communication informing the battalion commander that civilians had been killed, and that the latter had replied, \"We know, it's not to our liking, and don't interfere.\"\nAt around 08:00, military correspondent Ze'ev Schiff received a tip-off a source in the General Staff in Tel Aviv that there had been a slaughter in the camps. Checking round for some hours, he got no confirmation other than that there \"there's something.\" At 11:00 he met with Mordechai Tzipori, Minister of Communications and conveyed his information. Unable to reach Military Intelligence by phone, he got in touch with Yitzhak Shamir at 11:19 asking him to check reports of a Phalangist slaughter in the camps. Shamir testified that from his recollection the main thing Tzipori had told him of was that 3/4 IDF soldiers killed, no mention of a massacre or slaughter, as opposed to a \"rampage\" had been made. He made no check because his impression was that the point of the information was to keep him updated on IDF losses. At a meeting with American diplomats at 12:30 Shamir made no mention of what Tzipori told him, saying he expected that he would hear from Ariel Sharon, the Military Intelligence chief and the American Morris Draper about the situation in West Beirut, At that noontime meeting Sharon insisted that \"terrorists\" needed \"mopping up.\" Americans pressed for the intervention of the Lebanese National Army, and for an IDF withdrawal immediately. Sharon replied:\nI just don't understand, what are you looking for? Do you want the terrorists to stay? Are you afraid that somebody will think that you were in collusion with us? Deny it. We denied it,\nadding that nothing would happen except perhaps for a few more terrorists being killed, which would be a benefit to all. Shamir and Sharon finally agreed to a gradual withdrawal, at the end of Rosh Hashana, two days later. Draper then warned them:\nSure, the I.D.F. is going to stay in West Beirut and they will let the Lebanese go and kill the Palestinians in the camps.\nSharon replied:\nSo, we'll kill them. They will not be left there. You are not going to save them. You are not going to save these groups of the international terrorism.. . If you don't want the Lebanese to kill them, we will kill them.\nIn the afternoon, before 16:00, Lieutenant Grabowski had one of his men ask a Phalangist why they were killing civilians, and was told that pregnant women will give birth to children who will grow up to be terrorists.\nAt Beirut airport at 16:00 journalist Ron Ben-Yishai heard from several Israeli officers that they had heard that killings had taken place in the camps. At 11:30 he telephoned Ariel Sharon to report on the rumours, and was told by Sharon that he had already heard of the stories from the Chief of Staff.\nAt 16:00 in a meeting with the Phalangist staff, with Mossad present, the Israeli Chief of Staff said he had a \"positive impression\" of their behavior in the field and from what the Phalangists reported, and asked them to continue 'mopping up the empty camps' until 5\u00a0am, whereupon they must desist due to American pressure. According to the Kahan Commission investigation, neither side explicitly mentioned to each other reports or rumours about the way civilians were being treated in the camp. Between 18:00 and 20:00, Israeli Foreign Ministry personnel in Beirut and in Israel began receiving various reports from U.S. representatives that the Phalangists had been observed in the camps and that their presence was likely to cause problems. On returning to Israel, the Chief of Staff spoke to Ariel Sharon between 20:00 and 21:00, and according to Sharon, informed him that the \"Lebanese had gone too far\", and that \"the Christians had harmed the civilian population more than was expected.\" This, he testified, was the first he had ever heard of Phalangist irregularities in the camps. The Chief of Staff denied they had discussed any killings \"beyond what had been expected\".\nLater in the afternoon, a meeting was held between the Israeli Chief of Staff and the Phalangist staff.\nOn the morning of Friday, 17 September, the Israeli Army surrounding Sabra and Shatila ordered the Phalange to halt their operation, concerned about reports of a massacre.\nForeign reporters' testimonies.\nOn 17 September, while Sabra and Shatila still were sealed off, a few independent observers managed to enter. Among them were a Norwegian journalist and diplomat Gunnar Flakstad, who observed Phalangists during their cleanup operations, removing dead bodies from destroyed houses in the Shatila camp.\nMany of the bodies found had been severely mutilated. Young men had been castrated, some were scalped, and some had the Christian cross carved into their bodies.\nJanet Lee Stevens, an American journalist, later wrote to her husband, Dr. Franklin Lamb, \"I saw dead women in their houses with their skirts up to their waists and their legs spread apart; dozens of young men shot after being lined up against an alley wall; children with their throats slit, a pregnant woman with her stomach chopped open, her eyes still wide open, her blackened face silently screaming in horror; countless babies and toddlers who had been stabbed or ripped apart and who had been thrown into garbage piles.\"\nBefore the massacre, it was reported that the leader of the PLO, Yasir Arafat, had requested the return of international forces, from Italy, France and the United States, to Beirut to protect civilians. Those forces had just supervised the departure of Arafat and his PLO fighters from Beirut. Italy expressed 'deep concerns' about 'the new Israeli advance', but no action was taken to return the forces to Beirut. \"The New York Times\" reported in September 1982:\nYasir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, demanded today that the United States, France and Italy send their troops back to Beirut to protect its inhabitants against Israel...\"The dignity of three armies and the honor of their countries is involved\", Mr. Arafat said at his news conference. \"I ask Italy, France and the United States: What of your promise to protect the inhabitants of Beirut?\"\nIn interviews with film director Lokman Slim in 2005, some of the Lebanese Christian militia fighters reported that, prior to the massacre, the IDF took them to training camps in Israel and showed them documentaries about the Holocaust. The Israelis told the Lebanese fighters that the same would happen to them too, as a minority in Lebanon, if the fighters did not take action against the Palestinians. The film was called \"Massaker\", it featured six perpetrators of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and it was awarded the \"Fipresci Prize\" at the 2005 Berlinale.\nRole of various parties.\nThe primary responsibility for the massacre is generally attributed to Elie Hobeika. Robert Maroun Hatem, Elie Hobeika's bodyguard, stated in his book \"From Israel to Damascus\" that Hobeika ordered the massacre of civilians in defiance of Israeli instructions to behave like a \"dignified\" army.\nHobeika was assassinated by a car bomb in Beirut on 24 January 2002. Lebanese and Arab commentators blamed Israel for the murder of Hobeika, with alleged Israeli motive that Hobeika would be \"apparently poised to testify before the Belgian court about Sharon's role in the massacre\" (see section above). Prior to his assassination, Elie Hobeika had stated \"I am very interested that the [Belgian] trial starts because my innocence is a core issue.\"\nAccording to Alain Menargues, on 15 September, an Israeli special operations group of Sayeret Matkal entered the camp to liquidate a number of Palestinian cadres, and left the same day. It was followed the next day, by \"killers\" from the Sa'ad Haddad's South Lebanon Army, before the Lebanese Forces units of Elie Hobeika entered the camps.\nThe US responsibility was considerable; indeed the Arab states and the PLO blamed the US. The negotiations under the mediation of US diplomat Philip Habib, which oversaw the withdrawal of the PLO from Beirut, had assigned responsibility to the American-led Multinational Force for guaranteeing the safety of those non-combatant Palestinians who remained. The US administration was criticized for the early withdrawal of the Multinational Force, a criticism which George Shultz accepted later. Shultz recounted in his memoirs that \"The brutal fact is that we are partially responsible. We took the Israelis and Lebanese at their word\". On 20 September the Multinational Force was redeployed to Beirut.\nAftermath.\nU.N. condemnation.\nOn 16 December 1982, the United Nations General Assembly condemned the massacre and declared it to be an act of genocide.\nThe voting record on section D of Resolution 37/123 was: yes: 123; no: 0; abstentions: 22; non-voting: 12.\nThe delegate for Canada stated: \"The term genocide cannot, in our view, be applied to this particular inhuman act\". The delegate of Singapore \u2013 voting 'yes' \u2013 added: \"My delegation regrets the use of the term 'an act of genocide'\u00a0... [as] the term 'genocide' is used to mean acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\" Canada and Singapore questioned whether the General Assembly was competent to determine whether such an event would constitute genocide. The Soviet Union, by contrast, asserted that: \"The word for what Israel is doing on Lebanese soil is genocide. Its purpose is to destroy the Palestinians as a nation.\" The Nicaragua delegate asserted: \"It is difficult to believe that a people that suffered so much from the Nazi policy of extermination in the middle of the twentieth century would use the same fascist, genocidal arguments and methods against other peoples.\"\nThe United States commented that \"While the criminality of the massacre was beyond question, it was a serious and reckless misuse of language to label this tragedy genocide as defined in the 1948 Convention\".\nWilliam Schabas, director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland, stated that \"there was little discussion of the scope of the term genocide, which had obviously been chosen to embarrass Israel rather than out of any concern with legal precision\".\nIrish Commission (MacBride).\nThe independent commission headed by Se\u00e1n MacBride looking into reported violations of International Law by Israel, however, did find that the concept of genocide applied to the case as the intention of those behind the massacre was \"the deliberate destruction of the national and cultural rights and identity of the Palestinian people\". Individual Jews throughout the world also denounced the massacre as genocide.\nThe MacBride Commission's report, \"Israel in Lebanon\", concluded that the Israeli authorities or forces were responsible in the massacres and other killings that have been reported to have been carried out by Lebanese militiamen in Sabra and Shatila in the Beirut area between 16 and 18 September. Unlike the Israeli commission, the McBride Commission did not work with the idea of separate degrees of responsibility, viz., direct and indirect.\nKahan Commission (Israel).\nIsrael's own Kahan commission found that only \"indirect\" responsibility befitted Israel's involvement. For British journalist David Hirst, Israel crafted the concept of indirect responsibility so as to make its involvement and responsibility seem smaller. He said of the commission's verdict that it was only by means of errors and omissions in the analysis of the massacre that the commission was able to reach the conclusion of indirect responsibility.\nThe Kahan Commission concluded Israeli Defense minister Sharon bore personal responsibility \"for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge\" and \"not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed\". Sharon's negligence in protecting the civilian population of Beirut, which had come under Israeli control, amounted to a non-fulfilment of a duty with which the Defense Minister was charged, and it was recommended that Sharon be dismissed as Defense Minister.\nAt first, Sharon refused to resign, and Begin refused to fire him. It was only after the death of Emil Grunzweig after a grenade was tossed by a right-wing Israeli into the dispersing crowd of a Peace Now protest march, which also injured ten others, that a compromise was reached: Sharon would resign as Defense Minister, but remain in the Cabinet as a minister without portfolio. Notwithstanding the dissuading conclusions of the Kahan report, Sharon would later become Prime Minister of Israel.\nThe Kahan commission also recommended the dismissal of Director of Military Intelligence Yehoshua Saguy, and the effective promotion freeze of Division Commander Brig. Gen. Amos Yaron for at least three years.\nOn 25 September 1982, Peace Now, which had been established 4 years previously, organised in Tel Aviv a protest\u00a0demonstration which brought to the streets some 10% of Israel's population, an estimated 400,000 participants. They expressed their anger and demanded an investigation into Israel's part and responsibility in the massacre. It would remain Israel's largest street protest until the 2023 Israeli judicial reform protests and 7 September 2024 rally for the liberation of hostages in exchange for a cease-fire deal with Hamas.\nAn opinion poll indicated that 51.7% of the Israeli public thought the commission was too harsh, and only 2.17% too lenient.\nPost-war testimonies by Lebanese Forces operatives.\nLokhman Slim and Monika Borgman's \"Massaker\", based on 90 hours of interviews with the LF soldiers who participated in the massacre, gives the participants' memories of how they were drawn into the militia, trained with the Israeli army and unleashed on the camps to take revenge for the murder of Bachir Gemayel. The motivations are varied, from blaming beatings from their fathers in childhood, the effects of the brutalization of war, obedience to one's leaders, a belief that the camp women would breed future terrorists, and the idea three-quarters of the residents were terrorists. Others spoke of their violence without traces of repentance.\nLawsuits against Sharon.\nSharon's libel suit.\nAriel Sharon sued \"Time\" magazine for libel in American and Israeli courts in a $50\u00a0million suit, after \"Time\" published a story in its 21 February 1983, issue, implying that Sharon had \"reportedly discussed with the Gemayels the need for the Phalangists to take revenge\" for Bachir's assassination. The jury found the article false and defamatory, although \"Time\" won the suit in the U.S. court because Sharon's defense failed to establish that the magazine's editors and writers had \"acted out of malice\", as required under U.S. libel law.\nRelatives of victims sue Sharon.\nAfter Sharon's 2001 election as Israeli Prime Minister, relatives of the victims of the massacre filed a lawsuit in the Belgian courts. Following diplomatic pressure from the United States, Belgium tightened its jurisdictional requirements, which led to the case's dismissal on 24 September 2003 since none of the plaintiffs had Belgian nationality at the start of the case.\nReprisal attacks.\nAccording to Robert Fisk, Osama bin Laden cited the Sabra and Shatila massacre as one of the motivations for the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, in which al-Qaeda attacked an American Air Force housing complex in Saudi Arabia.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52269", "revid": "36281927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52269", "title": "Edward Heath", "text": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1970 to 1974\nSir Edward Richard George Heath (9 July 1916 \u2013 17 July 2005) was a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1970 to 1974 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1965 to 1975. Heath also served for 51 years as a Member of Parliament from 1950 to 2001. Outside politics, Heath was a yachtsman, a musician, and an author.\nBorn in Broadstairs, Kent, Heath was the son of a chambermaid and carpenter. He attended Chatham House Grammar School in Ramsgate, Kent, and became a leader within student politics while studying at Balliol College at the University of Oxford. During World War II, Heath served as an officer in the Royal Artillery. He worked briefly in the Civil Service, but resigned in order to stand for Parliament, and was elected for Bexley at the 1950 election. He was promoted to become Chief Whip by Anthony Eden in 1955, and in 1959 was appointed to the Cabinet by Harold Macmillan as Minister of Labour. He later held the role of Lord Privy Seal and in 1963, was made President of the Board of Trade by Alec Douglas-Home. After the Conservatives were defeated at the 1964 election, Heath was elected as Leader of the Conservative Party in 1965, becoming Leader of the Opposition. Although he led the Conservatives to a landslide defeat at the 1966 election, he remained in the leadership, and at the 1970 election led his party to an unexpected victory.\nDuring his time as prime minister, Heath oversaw the decimalisation of British coinage in 1971, and in 1972 he led the reformation of local government, significantly reducing the number of local authorities and creating several new metropolitan counties, much of which remains to this day. A strong supporter of British membership of the European Economic Community (EEC), Heath's \"finest hour\" came in 1973, when he led the United Kingdom into membership of what would later become the European Union. However, his premiership also coincided with the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, with his approval of internment without trial and subsequent suspension of the Stormont Parliament seeing the imposition of direct British rule. Unofficial talks with Provisional Irish Republican Army delegates were unsuccessful, as was the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973, which led the MPs of the Ulster Unionist Party to withdraw from the Conservative whip. Heath also tried to reform British trade unionism with the Industrial Relations Act, and hoped to deregulate the economy and make a transfer from direct to indirect taxation, such as with the introduction of value-added tax in 1973. However, a miners' strike at the start of 1974 severely damaged the Government, causing the implementation of the Three-Day Week to conserve energy. Attempting to resolve the situation, Heath called an election for February 1974, attempting to obtain a mandate to face down the miners' wage demands, but this instead resulted in a hung parliament, with the Conservatives losing their majority. Despite gaining fewer votes, the Labour Party won four more seats, and Heath resigned as Prime Minister on 4 March after talks with the Liberal Party to form a coalition government were unsuccessful.\nAfter losing a second successive election in October 1974, Heath's leadership was challenged by Margaret Thatcher and, on 4 February, she narrowly outpolled him in the first round. Heath chose to resign the leadership rather than contest the second round, returning to the backbenches, where he would remain until 2001. In 1975, he played a major role in the referendum on British membership of the EEC, campaigning for the eventually successful \"remain\" vote. Heath would later become an embittered critic of Thatcher during her time as prime minister, speaking and writing against the policies of Thatcherism. Following the 1992 election, he became Father of the House, until his retirement from the Commons in 2001. He died in 2005, aged 89. Heath has been described by the BBC as \"the first working-class meritocrat\" to become Conservative leader in \"the party's modern history\" and \"a One Nation Tory in the Disraeli tradition who rejected the \"laissez-faire\" capitalism that Thatcher would enthusiastically endorse.\"\nEarly life.\nEdward Richard George Heath was born at 54 Albion Road, Broadstairs, Kent, on 9 July 1916, the son of William George Heath (1888\u20131976), a carpenter who built airframes for Vickers during the First World War, and was subsequently employed as a builder and Edith Anne Heath (\"n\u00e9e\" Pantony; 1888\u20131951), a lady's maid. His father was later a successful small businessman after taking over a building and decorating firm. Heath's paternal grandfather had run a small dairy business, and when that failed worked as a porter at Broadstairs Station on the Southern Railway. Edward was four years old when his younger brother, John, was born; there was no question that Edward was the \"favoured brother\". Heath was known as \"Teddy\" as a young man. He was educated at Chatham House Grammar School in Ramsgate, and in 1935 with the aid of a county scholarship he went up to study at Balliol College, Oxford.\nIn later years, Heath's peculiar accent, with its \"strangulated\" vowel sounds, combined with his non-Standard pronunciation of \"l\" as \"w\" and \"out\" as \"eout\", was satirised by Monty Python in the audio sketch \"Teach Yourself Heath\" (released on a 7\" flexi-disc single included with initial copies of their 1972 LP \"Monty Python's Previous Record\"). Heath's biographer John Campbell speculates that his speech, unlike that of his father and younger brother, who both spoke with Kent accents, must have undergone \"drastic alteration on encountering Oxford\", although retaining elements of Kent speech.\nOxford.\nA talented musician, Heath won the college's organ scholarship in his first term (he had previously tried for the organ scholarships at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, and Keble College, Oxford) which enabled him to stay at the university for a fourth year; he eventually graduated with a Second Class Honours BA in Philosophy, politics and economics in 1939.\nWhile at university Heath became active in Conservative Party politics. On the key political issue of the day, foreign policy, he opposed the Conservative-dominated government of the day ever more openly. His first Paper Speech (i.e. a major speech listed on the Order Paper along with the visiting guest speakers) at the Oxford Union, in 1936, was in opposition to the appeasement of Germany by returning her colonies, confiscated during the First World War.\nIn June 1937 Heath was elected President of the Oxford University Conservative Association as a pro-Spanish Republic candidate, in opposition to the pro-Franco John Stokes (himself later a Conservative MP). In 1937\u201338 Heath was chairman of the national Federation of University Conservative Associations, and in the same year (his third at university) he was Secretary and then Librarian of the Oxford Union. At the end of the year he was defeated for the Presidency of the Oxford Union by another Balliol candidate, Alan Wood, on the issue of whether the Chamberlain government should give way to a left-wing Popular Front. On that occasion, Heath supported the government.\nIn his final year Heath was the president of Balliol College's Junior Common Room, an office held in subsequent years by his near-contemporaries Denis Healey, who would become a lifelong friend and political rival and Roy Jenkins, and as such was invited to support the Master of Balliol Alexander Lindsay, who stood as an anti-appeasement 'Independent Progressive' candidate against the official Conservative candidate, Quintin Hogg, in the 1938 Oxford by-election.\nHeath, who had himself applied to be the Conservative candidate for the by-election, accused the government in an October Union Debate of \"turning all four cheeks\" to Adolf Hitler, and was elected as President of the Oxford Union in November 1938, sponsored by Balliol, after winning the Presidential Debate that \"This House has No Confidence in the National Government as presently constituted\". He was thus President in Hilary term 1939; the visiting Leo Amery described him in his diaries as \"a pleasant youth\".\nAs an undergraduate, Heath travelled widely in Europe. His opposition to appeasement was nourished by his witnessing first-hand a Nuremberg rally in 1937, where he met leading Nazis Hermann G\u00f6ring, Joseph Goebbels, and Heinrich Himmler at an SS cocktail party. He later described Himmler as \"the most evil man I have ever met\". He was in Germany for two months to learn German but did not keep up any fluency in the language in later life. In 1938 he visited Barcelona, then under attack from Spanish Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War. On one occasion a car in which he was travelling came under machine-gun fire, while on another a bomb hit his hotel whilst he was observing an air raid from outside. In the summer of 1939, accompanied by his Jewish friend Madron Seligman, he travelled to Danzig and Poland. They made the return journey by hitchhiking and rail across Germany through mobilising troops, returning to Britain just before the declaration of war.\nSecond World War.\nHeath spent late 1939 and early 1940 on a debating tour of the United States before being called up. On 22 March 1941, he received an emergency commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. During the war he initially served with heavy anti-aircraft guns around Liverpool (which suffered heavy German bombing raids in May 1941) and by early 1942 was regimental adjutant, with the substantive rank of captain.\nHeath participated as an adjutant in the Normandy landings, where he met Maurice Schumann, French Foreign Minister under Pompidou. As a temporary major commanding a battery of his own, he provided artillery support during the Allied campaigns in France and Germany in 1944\u201345, for which he received a mention in despatches on 8 November 1945.\nHeath later remarked that \"[it's] one thing to be in the war, and you see the enemy on the other side and so you bombard them, and then later on when you pass over their ground, you see dead bodies lying around\". In September 1945 he commanded a firing squad that executed a Polish soldier convicted of rape and murder. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division (MBE) on 24 January 1946. He was demobilised in August 1946 and promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel on 1 May 1947.\nHeath joined the Honourable Artillery Company as a lieutenant-colonel on 1 September 1951, in which he remained active throughout the 1950s, rising to commanding officer of the Second Battalion; a portrait of him in full dress uniform still hangs in the Queens Room of the HAC's Armoury House. In April 1971, as prime minister, he wore his lieutenant-colonel's insignia to inspect troops.\nPost-war, 1945\u20131950.\nBefore the war, Heath had won a scholarship to Gray's Inn and had begun making preparations for a career at the Bar, but after the war he was placed in joint top position in the civil service examinations. He then became a civil servant in the Ministry of Civil Aviation (he was disappointed not to be posted to the Treasury, but declined an offer to join the Foreign Office, fearing that foreign postings might prevent him from entering politics).\nHeath joined a team under Alison Munro tasked with drawing up a scheme for British airports using some of the many Second World War RAF bases, and was specifically charged with planning the home counties. Years later she attributed his evident enthusiasm for Maplin Airport to this work. Then much to the surprise of civil service colleagues, he sought adoption as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Bexley and resigned in November 1947.\nAfter working as news editor of the \"Church Times\" from February 1948 to September 1949, Heath worked as a management trainee at the merchant bankers Brown, Shipley &amp; Co. until his election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bexley in the February 1950 general election. In the election he defeated an old contemporary from the Oxford Union, Ashley Bramall, by a margin of 133 votes.\nEarly political career (1950\u20131965).\nMember of Parliament.\nHeath made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 26 June 1950, in which he appealed to the Labour government to participate in the Schuman Plan. As MP for Bexley, he gave enthusiastic speeches in support of the young candidate for neighbouring Dartford, Margaret Roberts, later Margaret Thatcher.\nHe was appointed as an opposition whip by Winston Churchill in February 1951. He remained in the whip's office after the Conservatives won the 1951 general election, rising rapidly to Joint Deputy Chief Whip, Deputy Chief Whip and, in December 1955, Government Chief Whip under Anthony Eden. Journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft has observed that \"Of all government jobs, this requires firmness and fairness allied to tact and patience and Heath's ascent seems baffling in hindsight\".\nIn office.\nDue to the convention that whips did not speak in Parliament, Heath managed to keep out of the controversy over the Suez Crisis. On the announcement of Eden's resignation, Heath submitted a report on the opinions of the Conservative MPs regarding Eden's possible successors. This report favoured Harold Macmillan and helped to secure Macmillan the premiership in January 1957. Macmillan later appointed Heath Minister of Labour, a Cabinet Minister\u2014as Chief Whip Heath had attended Cabinet, but had not been formally a member\u2014after winning the October 1959 election.\nIn 1960 Macmillan appointed Heath Lord Privy Seal with responsibility for the negotiations to secure the UK's first attempt to join the European Communities (or Common Market, as it was then more widely known). After extensive negotiations, involving detailed agreements about the UK's agricultural trade with Commonwealth countries such as New Zealand, British entry was vetoed by the French President, Charles de Gaulle, at a press conference in January 1963 \u2013 much to the disappointment of Heath, who was a firm supporter of European common market membership for the United Kingdom. He oversaw a successful application when serving as prime minister a decade later.\nAfter this setback, a major humiliation for Macmillan's foreign policy, Heath was not a contender for the party leadership on Macmillan's retirement in October 1963. Under prime minister Alec Douglas-Home he was President of the Board of Trade and Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development, and oversaw the abolition of retail price maintenance, as well as the move of the August Bank Holiday to extend the holiday season and reduce congestion.\nLeader of the Opposition (1965\u20131970).\nParty leadership.\nAfter the Conservative Party lost the general election of 1964, the defeated Home changed the party leadership rules to allow for a ballot by MPs and then, in July 1965, he resigned. Heath\u2014who was Shadow Chancellor at the time, and had recently won favourable publicity for leading the fight against Labour's Finance Bill\u2014unexpectedly won the party's leadership contest, gaining 150 votes to Reginald Maudling's 133 and Enoch Powell's 15. Heath became the Conservatives' youngest leader and retained office following the party's defeat in the general election of 1966.\nIn April 1968 Enoch Powell made his controversial \"Rivers of Blood\" speech, which criticised immigration to the United Kingdom. Soon afterwards Heath telephoned Margaret Thatcher to inform her that he was going to sack Powell from the Shadow cabinet; she recalled that she \"really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis\". The next day Heath sacked Powell. Several Conservatives on the right protested against Powell's sacking. According to Heath, he never spoke to Powell again.\n1970 election.\nWith another general election approaching in 1970 a Conservative policy document emerged from the Selsdon Park Hotel that offered free-market\u2013oriented policies as solutions to the country's unemployment and inflation problems. Heath stated that the Selsdon weekend only reaffirmed policies that had actually been evolving since he became leader of the Conservative Party. The Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, thought the document a vote-loser and dubbed it the product of \"Selsdon Man\" \u2013 after the supposedly prehistoric \"Piltdown Man\" \u2013 to portray it as reactionary. Heath's Conservative Party won the general election of 1970 with 330 seats to Labour's 287. The new cabinet included the future prime minister Margaret Thatcher (Education and Science), William Whitelaw (Leader of the House of Commons) and the former prime minister Alec Douglas-Home (Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs).\nPremiership (1970\u20131974).\nWelfare state.\nDuring Heath's first year in office, higher charges were introduced for benefits of the welfare state such as school meals, spectacles, dentistry, and prescriptions. Entitlement to State Sickness Benefit was also changed so that it would only be paid after the first three days of sickness. In 1971 a series of measures was introduced designed to limit the availability of supplementary benefit. In particular, as noted by one study, \"tax rebates and strike pay were treated as resources, subject to a \u00a34 disregard.\" The Social Security Act of 1971 increased the financial penalty for leaving work or refusing a job without good cause, and also withdrew benefit for the first three days of unemployment and industrial injury. The same Act imposed a 40% reduction for voluntary unemployment. The 1971 Social Security Act also made provision for supplementary benefit to be automatically reduced for claimants disqualified for unemployment benefits and also (as noted by one study) \u201cof all those claimants whose unemployment benefits are suspended while insurance officers \" \" \" investigate \" the circumstances of their leaving their jobs or being sacked.\u201d In 1972, a procedure was introduced under which claimants from outside an area who had moved to that area in search of work had one week to find a job before being cut off. From April 1972 a man returning from work after being on strike had to pay back any supplementary benefit received to tide him over during the first 15 days at work before he got his pay. In February 1973, the rules about help in urgent cases were made more stringent. Also in regards to strikers, the Social Security Act of 1971 reduced the disregards (the normal sums, the principal strike payments and the tax refunds) that were disregarded in calculating the entitlement of a family to benefit. Also, from 3 April 1972 onwards, as noted by one MP\n\u201cany payment for supplementary benefit made in the fortnight following a return to work is recoverable, normally by means of a deduction from pay by the employer. Further, supplementary benefit will not normally be paid in the first fortnight of a dispute when employees have their first week's wages and a week's \"wages in hand\" available to them. Nor is benefit paid to meet commitments incurred before a strike began, such as hire-purchase instalments, rent arrears or outstanding gas or electricity bills.\u201d\nNoting the impact of the 1971 Social Security Act, one MP argued that\n\u201cThe Social Security Act, 1971, causes a great deal of misery and hardship within my area. It affects people who have been disqualified from benefit because they have left their job for no good reason, and other unfortunate people who have been charged with industrial misconduct. Industrial misconduct is hard to define but the unfortunate people who are charged with it find it extremely difficult to survive on the payments they receive under Section 1(2) of the Act. They now receive 40 per cent. less than do the people who are on supplementary benefit. Under the previous legislation there was a discount of 75p, but perhaps that amount was not considered by this Government to be a sufficient deterrent to people leaving their jobs. The application of a 40 per cent. reduction in the allowance given to these persons who have been refused unemployment benefit causes a great deal of hardship and misery.\u201d\nAs a result of the squeeze in the education budget, the provision of free school milk was ended for 8- to 11-year-olds (it had already been ended for older children by Harold Wilson); the tabloid press christened Margaret Thatcher, the then Education Secretary as \"Margaret Thatcher: Milk Snatcher\". \nDespite these measures, the Heath government encouraged a significant increase in welfare spending, and Thatcher blocked Macleod's other posthumous education policy: the abolition of the Open University, which had recently been founded by the preceding Labour government. In addition, despite the end of cheap milk provision, 700,000 school children remained entitled to free milk. The Legal Advice and Assistance Act 1972 provided for better facilities for advice and assistance at an early stage in a dispute. The Social Needs (Grants) Act 9NI) 1970 \"made provision for the authorisation of the payment of grants towards expenditure incurred due to special social need in urban areas.\" From 1971 onwards, in regards to supplementary benefit, the requirements of a striker (his normal requirements) were disregarded in full. In January 1973, the Criminal Justice Act 1972 came into effect in England and Wales. It extended the court's power \"to order an offender to pay compensation for personal injury, loss, or damage.\" In June 1973 a new lower rate of attendance allowance was introduced for those aged 16 to 64, while lower rates \"for the aged under 15 and those over 65 were introduced on 1 October and 3 December respectively.\" Another change allowed for small claims of less than \u00a375 to be dealt with in a less formal manner within the County Court system. Rules of evidence and requirements of legal representation were relaxed to make it viable to claim such small sums under the County Court Act 1959 as amended by the Administration of Justice Act (E&amp;W) 1973. The Land Compensation Act of 1973 \u201cincreased compensation for persons displaced by public development projects.\u201d\nProvision was made under the National Insurance (Old Persons' and Widows' Pensions and Attendances Allowances) Act 1970 for pensions to be paid to old people who had been excluded from the pre-1948 pension schemes and were accordingly excluded from the comprehensive scheme that was introduced in 1948. About 100,000 people were affected by this change, half of whom were receiving Supplementary Benefit under the social security scheme. The Act also made improvements to the Widow's Pension scheme by introducing a scale that started at 30 shillings a week for women widowed at the age of 40 and rose to the full rate of \u00a35 at the age of 50.\nConsiderable support was provided for nursery school building, and a long-term capital investment programme in school building was launched. A Family Fund was set up to assist families with children who had congenital conditions, while new benefits were introduced benefiting hundreds of thousands of disabled persons whose disabilities had been caused neither by war nor by industrial injury. An Attendance Allowance was introduced for those needing care at home, together with Invalidity Benefit for the long-term sick, while a higher Child Allowance was made available where invalidity allowance was paid. Widow's Benefits were introduced for those aged between forty and fifty years of age, improved subsidies for slum clearance were made available, while Rent Allowances were introduced for private tenants. In April 1971, the right to education was given to all children with Down's syndrome for the first time. The National Insurance (Married Women) Amendment Regulations 1971 extended the provisions of the National Insurance (Married Women) Regulations 1948. The Pneumoconiosis, Byssinosis and Miscellaneous Diseases Benefit (Amendment) Scheme of 1971 made various improvements to the previous Pneumoconiosis, Byssinosis and Miscellaneous Diseases Benefit scheme introduced in 1966. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation (Supplementation) Amendment Scheme 1971 increased the weekly rate of lesser incapacity allowance that was payable under certain circumstances. Provision was also made (in regards to interest on compensation for injurious affection where no land is taken) for interest to payable on injurious affection, for the injurious affection claim, on farm loss payments, and on disturbance payments.\nThe school leaving age was raised to 16, while Family Income Supplement was introduced to boost the incomes of low-income earners. Families who received this benefit were exempted from NHS charges while the children in such families were eligible for free school meals. Non-contributory pensions were also introduced for all persons aged eighty and above, while the Social Security Act 1973 was passed which introduced benefit indexation in the United Kingdom for the first time by index-linking benefits to prices to maintain their real value. An amendment to the Social Security Act of 1973 required the secretary of state to publicize benefits for the disabled. The National Insurance Act of 1971 introduced a special addition with no means test for all pensioners over 80, while in 1972 a \u00a310 Christmas bonus was introduced. Annual upratings for all pensioners was also introduced. The Conservatives had previously promised in 1970 to review pensions every two years, but instead instituted an annual review. From October 1973 onwards a higher ' long \u2013 term rate ' of supplementary benefit \"was paid to those who had received supplementary benefit for a continuous period.\" A decision was also made (from October 1973 onwards) to uprate long-term benefits by a larger amount than short-term benefits. That same year, a basic short-term rates were introduced for everyone else; the short-term sick and unemployed in the main. From 1972 onwards, \"while there is no statutory commitment to this effect, the same cash increases have been made in the leading supplementary benefit scale rates as in their national insurance counterparts.\" In 1973, a statutory commitment to uprate national insurance benefits in line with prices was introduced in 1973. The Industrial Relations Act of 1971 gave employees \"the right, depending on a minimum qualifying period, to appeal to an industrial tribunal, where compensation for unfair dismissal could be awarded based on length of service,\" and in 1972 preservation of accrued pension benefits after 5 or more years' service was introduced. The Legal Advice and Assistance Act 1972 set up a Green Form scheme under which advice of up to two hours, free of charge to the poorest or at reduced rates to those of modest means, became available. The Housing Finance Act 1972 \"introduced a national formula for rent increases in the public sector and a mandatory system of local rent and rate rebates that survived subsequent legislation.\" The Supplementary Benefit (Determination of Requirements) Regulations 1972 increased the rent addition for non-householders and removed the present age qualification. The Students' Dependents' Allowances Regulations 1973 enabled the Secretary of State \"to pay allowances to students attending first degree university etc. courses and courses for the training of teachers.\" A social security amendment of 1973 provided for allowing the Supplementary Benefits Commission \"to make payments to cover funeral expenses without having regard to the powers of local authorities, so that the commission will not be inhibited by the fact that local authorities have certain powers concerning the disposal of bodies.\" Subsequently, the Commission \"revised its policy on payments towards funeral expenses . Claimants are no longer advised to ask the Local Authority to make funeral arrangements, and the Commission will consider paying towards the costs of a private funeral under its powers to meet exceptional needs.\"\nThe Redundant Mineworkers and Concessionary Coal (Payments Schemes) Order 1973 provided for three new types of benefits, including \"lump sums based on length of service for men redundant between age 35 and 55, and for men over 55 who due to lack of service in the industry do not qualify for basic benefit; a new benefit equivalent to the current rate of unemployment benefit to be paid to men when they have exhausted their 156 weeks of basic benefit until they reach age 65; and concessionary coal benefits for men made redundant between age 55 and 60, and certain men redundant over age 60. (Most men redundant over age 60 already receive concessionary coal under existing arrangements.) In addition, \"The amount of benefit which a beneficiary may retain if he obtains other employment has also been increased.\" The Employment and Training Act 1973 included various provisions. For instance, as specified in the text of the Act, \"The Secretary of State may\u2014 pay to any person appointed in pursuance of the preceding paragraph such subsistence and travelling allowances and such compensation for loss of remunerative time as the Secretary of State may determine with the approval of the Minister for the Civil Service.\" In addition, \"An industrial training board may\u2014 pay maintenance and travelling allowances to persons attending courses provided or approved by the board; make grants or loans to persons providing courses or other facilities approved by the board, to persons who make studies for the purpose of providing such courses or facilities and to persons who maintain arrangements to provide such courses or facilities which are not for the time being in use; pay fees to persons providing further education in respect of persons who receive it in association with their training in courses provided or approved by the board; make payments to persons in connection with arrangements under which they or employees of theirs make use of courses or other facilities provided or approved by the board.\"\nThe Redundant Mineworkers (Payments Scheme) Order 1972 was intended to be available for 3 years \"to any miner who is made redundant after he has reached 55 to help him to adjust to the new situation and to the difficulties which confront him.\" It included a number of provisions for miners and their dependents including the addition of cost of living increments, a basic scheme benefit, an increase from \u00a33 to \u00a36 a week to the benefit \"which can be kept if a redundant mineworker finds a new job and enters new employment, because if he did he would probably incur income tax, perhaps National Insurance contributions, travelling expenses and other expenses which might well have exceeded the \u00a33 which he would have been able to draw if he had continued to draw that from the redundant mineworkers payment scheme.\" The rent allowance which is payable to a redundant mineworker was made transferable to a new house if he were to move his home, the rules regarding the offsetting of State and other coal industry benefits against the total of the mineworkers' redundancy payment benefit were eased, and the scheme was changed \"so that in the event of a second redundancy\u2014if a miner is made redundant a second time\u2014his earnings are computed on the wages paid in the year immediately before the second redundancy as opposed to his previous level of earnings.\" Also, \"these last three concessions will apply to men who are in the existing scheme, not only to miners who might be made redundant in future, but to all those who are part of the existing scheme at the present time.\" The scheme also provided that the general increases in benefits, such as the special hardship allowance and workmen's compensation supplementation would not be offset as at present, and also provided for increases in benefits paid to men on workmen's compensation as a result of becoming total or major incapacity cases, award of special hardship allowance in respect of an accident or disease sustained after redundancies. In addition, \"any general increase in unemployment benefit between 6th April, 1972, and 6th April, 1973, will be offset against the benefit of men made redundant after 6th April, 1973.\" Also, \"the maximum amount of benefit that can be kept by those who get a job is increased from \u00a33 to \u00a36\" weekly, and \"the table of basic benefit appropriate to the various ranges of pre-redundancy earnings set out in Appendix 4 has been recalculated so that the basic benefit, plus the 1971 rate of unemployment benefit for a man and one adult dependant, equals, after tax and on average over the three years, 90 per cent. of previous take-home pay.\" Other provisions included service in the coal industry \"before nationalisation can now count towards the 10 qualifying years\" and that women \"who are not paying the full National Insurance stamp will be able to get some benefit despite not being eligible for unemployment benefit.\" In addition, \"days of absence from home which disqualify a person from unemployment benefit, and also from 72 scheme benefit, will be counted as days rather than one day in a week resulting in a whole week's disqualification as at present.\" Also, \"a man made redundant within the terms of the scheme and reemployed in the coal industry for more than a year and then made redundant a second time can choose on which of the two pre-redundancy earnings he wishes his benefit to be calculated.\" In addition, \"the requirement that in order to continue getting the rent allowance a person must continue to live in the same house in which he was living when he was made redundant, and that this house must continue to be owned by the board, is removed.\" Also, \"the relevant tax year on which pre-redundancy earnings are based will now be the previous tax year for everybody, instead of being two years ago for those made redundant during April.\" Also, as noted by one MP, \"Following the introduction of the first redundant mineworkers payments scheme in 1968, which provided benefits for men aged 55 or over on redundancy who otherwise satisfied the requirements of the scheme, there was pressure to enhance the terms available to enable such men to receive concessionary coal as though they had reached normal retirement age. The Government responded to this pressure in the Coal Industry Act 1973, amending the power to make schemes benefiting redundant mineworkers in the 1967 Act.\" Also in 1973, the first concessionary coal payments scheme was introduced by order, which provided for reimbursement to the National Coal Board \"of the full cost of concessionary coal to men aged 55 to 59 who qualified for benefits under the redundant mineworkers payments scheme from 14 December 1969, and half the cost of providing concessionary coal to such men age 60 to 65.\"\nA number of new superannuation provisions were introduced for various categories of workers. For those in the NHS, this included years and days used in benefit calculations instead of years and half years, the introduction of practitioner dynamising introduced i.e. 1.4% pensions, best of the last 3 years Total Superannuable Remuneration introduced instead of average of last 3 years, 3 x lump sum introduced for post 24 March 1972 service (married men), the introduction of a half rate widow's pension (was previously 1/3), a new rate of Child Allowance, a reduction in the qualifying period for pensions from 10 years to 5 years, the abolition of the qualifying period for Death Gratuities (DG), the introduction of double incapacity build up for service between 5 years and 9 years 364 days (or to age 65 if less), the introduction of 3 months initial widows pension, the introduction of widows limited pension (for 3, 4.5 or 6 months) for those widows who do not have title to continuing widows pensions, the introduction of a Limited Child Allowance, the introduction of automatic payment of benefits at age 70, the introduction of Added Years purchase, \"Pensions Increase Supplement may apply\" from January 1973 to October 1975, the extension of service to take account of untaken annual leave introduced for ancillary staff, and \"Part time service may be superannuable provided half or more of the w/t basic is worked.\" The Pensions (Increase) Act of 1971 provided for regular increases in public service pensions by statutory instrument. The Act was later amended in 1972 and 1974 \"to lower the minimum qualifying age for pensions increase from 60 to 55 and to provide for all pensions paid to widows of scheme members to be increased.\"\nThe Superannuation Act of 1972 provided for new arrangements for premature retirement on grounds of limited efficiency, granted civil servants rights to their pensions and established the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme, the Civil Service Additional Voluntary Contribution Scheme (CSAVCS), the Civil Service Compensation Scheme (CSCS) and the Civil Service Injury Benefits Scheme (CSIBS). The Local Government (Retirement of Chief Officers) Regulations 1973 provided \"for persons identified as chief officers and deputy chief officers of local authorities, and certain other persons affected by local government reorganisation, to elect for early retirement on enhanced pension terms and thereby forgo any right to claim compensation which might otherwise have been exercised under section 259 of the Local Government Act 1972.\" Section 27 of the Water Act 1973 empowered water authorities to establish and administer pension schemes and funds. The Social Security Act of 1973 made further provisions \"for occupational pensions, established the Occupational Pensions Board and the contributory reserve pension scheme under a Reserve Pension Board for not recognised pensionable employment.\" The Legal Aid Act 1974 raised the upper disposable income limit for eligibility for civil legal aid.\nScottish nationalism.\nScottish nationalism grew as a political force, while the decimalisation of British coinage, begun under the previous Labour government, was completed eight months after Heath came to power. The Central Policy Review Staff was established by Heath in February 1971, while the Local Government Act 1972 changed the boundaries of the counties of England and Wales and created Metropolitan Counties around the major cities (e.g. Merseyside around Liverpool): this caused significant public anger. Heath did not divide England into regions, choosing instead to await the report of the Crowther Commission on the constitution; the 10 Government Office Regions were eventually set up by the Major government in 1994.\nEconomic policy.\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, Iain Macleod, died and was replaced on 20 July 1970 by Anthony Barber. Heath's planned economic policy changes (including a significant shift from direct to indirect taxation) remained largely unimplemented: the Selsdon policy document was more or less abandoned as unemployment increased considerably by 1972. By January that year, the number of unemployed reached a million, the highest level for more than two decades. Opposed to unemployment on moral grounds, Heath encouraged a famous \"U-Turn\" in economic policy that precipitated what became known as the \"Barber Boom\". This was a two-range process involving the budgets of 1972 and 1973, the former of which pumped \u00a32.5\u00a0billion into the economy in increased pensions and benefits and tax reductions. By early 1974, as a result of this Keynesian economic strategy, unemployment had fallen to under 550,000. The economic boom did not last, and the Heath government implemented various cuts that led to the abandonment of policy goals such as a planned expansion of nursery education.\nTrade unions.\nMuch of the government's attention, as well as the media and public opinion, focused on deteriorating labour relations, as the government sought to weaken the economic power of the trade unions, which had grown steadily since 1945. The Industrial Relations Act 1971 set up a special court under the judge Lord Donaldson. Its imprisonment of striking dockworkers was a public relations disaster and became an object lesson for the Thatcher government of the 1980s. Thatcher relied instead on confiscating the assets of unions that courts found to have violated anti-strike laws.\nThe trade unions responded with a full-scale counterattack on a government hobbled by inflation and high unemployment. Especially damaging to the government's credibility were the two miners' strikes of 1972 and 1974, the latter of which resulted in much of the country's industry working a Three-Day Week in an attempt to conserve energy. The National Union of Mineworkers won its case but the energy shortages and the resulting breakdown of domestic consensus contributed to the eventual downfall of his government.\nUnemployment.\nThere was a steep rise in unemployment for the first two years of the Heath ministry, but it was then reversed. Labour in 1964 had inherited an unemployment count of around 400,000 but saw unemployment peak at 631,000 in early 1967. At election time in June 1970, the unemployment numbers were still high at 582,000. Heath and the Conservatives were pledged to \"full employment\" but within a year it became clear that they were losing that battle, as the official unemployment count crept towards 1,000,000 and some newspapers suggested that it was even higher. In January 1972 it was officially confirmed that unemployment had risen above 1,000,000 \u2013 a level not seen for more than 30 years. Various other reports around this time suggested that unemployment was higher still, with \"The Times\" newspaper claiming that \"nearly 3,000,000\" people were jobless by March of that year.\nForeign policy.\nUpon entering office in June 1970, Heath immediately set about trying to reverse Wilson's policy of ending Britain's military presence East of Suez. Heath took the United Kingdom into Europe on 1 January 1973, following passage in Parliament of the European Communities Act 1972 in October.\nHe publicly supported the massive U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong in December 1972.\nAccording to John McEvoy and Mark Curtis of Declassified UK, his government quickly recognised the military regime of Augusto Pinochet in Chile and maintained good relations with it, despite the illegal nature of the Pinochet regime's coup d'\u00e9tat.\nIn October 1973 he placed a British arms embargo on all combatants in the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War, which mostly affected the Israelis by preventing them obtaining spares for their Centurion tanks. Heath refused to allow US intelligence gathering from British bases in Cyprus, resulting in a temporary halt in the US signals intelligence tap.\nHe favoured links with the People's Republic of China, visiting Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1974 and 1975 and remaining an honoured guest in China on frequent visits thereafter and forming a close relationship with Mao's successor Deng Xiaoping. Heath realised that to become closer to Europe he needed to be further from the United States, so he downplayed the Special Relationship that had long knitted the two nations together. The two nations differed on such major crises as Britain's EC membership, the Nixon economic \"shocks\" of 1971, the Bangladesh Liberation War, d\u00e9tente with Soviet Union, Kissinger's Year of Europe and the Middle East crisis of 1973.\nNorthern Ireland.\nHeath served as Prime Minister during an especially violent period of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Events such as the Falls Curfew, Operation Motorman and Bloody Sunday led to the near-collapse in relations between the Irish Catholic community and British security forces. In 1971, Heath sent MI6 officer Frank Steele to hold talks with the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and find common ground to begin official negotiations. In July 1972, Heath permitted the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw, to hold unofficial talks in London with an IRA delegation led by Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in. In the aftermath of these unsuccessful talks, Heath pushed for a peaceful settlement with Northern Irish political parties exclusively committed to nonviolence.\nThe 1973 Sunningdale Agreement, which proposed a power-sharing deal, was strongly repudiated by many Unionists, including the Ulster Unionist Party, which withdrew its MPs at Westminster from the Conservative whip. The proposal was finally brought down by the Unionist Ulster Workers' Council strike in 1974, by which time Heath was no longer in office.\nHeath was targeted by the IRA for introducing internment without trial in Northern Ireland. In December 1974, an IRA active service unit threw a bomb onto the first-floor balcony of his home in Wilton Street, Belgravia where it exploded. Heath had been conducting a Christmas carol concert at Broadstairs and arrived home 10 minutes after the bomb exploded. No one was injured in the attack, but a landscape painted by Winston Churchill \u2013 given to Heath as a present \u2013 was damaged. In January 2003, Heath gave evidence to the Saville Inquiry and stated that he had never sanctioned unlawful lethal force in Northern Ireland.\nFall from power.\n1974 general elections.\nHeath tried to bolster his government by calling a general election for 28 February 1974, using the election slogan \"Who governs Britain?\". The result of the election was inconclusive with no party gaining an overall majority in the House of Commons; the Conservatives had the most votes but Labour had slightly more seats. Heath began negotiations with Jeremy Thorpe, leader of the Liberal Party, but when these failed, he resigned as prime minister on 4 March 1974, and was replaced by Wilson's minority Labour government, eventually confirmed, though with a tiny majority, in a second election in October. To date, Heath is the last British Prime Minister to have both assumed and lost their term of office by means of a general election.\nRise of Thatcher.\nHeath came to be seen as a liability by many Conservative MPs, party activists and newspaper editors. His personality was considered cold and aloof, annoying even to his friends. Alan Watkins observed in 1991 that his \"brusqueness, his gaucherie, his lack of small or indeed any talk, his sheer bad manners\" were among the factors costing him the support of Conservative backbenchers in the subsequent Conservative leadership election.\nHe resolved to remain Conservative leader, even after losing the October 1974 general election, and at first it appeared that by calling on the loyalty of his front-bench colleagues he might prevail. In the weeks following the second election defeat, Heath came under tremendous pressure to concede a review of the rules and agreed to establish a commission to propose changes and to seek re-election. There was no clear challenger after Enoch Powell had left the party and Keith Joseph had ruled himself out after controversial statements implying that the working classes should be encouraged to use more birth control. Joseph's close friend and ally Margaret Thatcher, who believed that an adherent to the philosophy of the Centre for Policy Studies should stand, joined the leadership contest in his place alongside the outsider Hugh Fraser. Aided by Airey Neave's campaigning among backbench MPs \u2014 whose earlier approach to William Whitelaw had been rebuffed, out of loyalty to Heath \u2014 she emerged as the only serious challenger.\nThe new rules permitted new candidates to enter the ballot in a second round of voting should the first be inconclusive, so Thatcher's challenge was considered by some to be that of a stalking horse. Neave deliberately understated Thatcher's support to attract wavering votes from MPs who were keen to see Heath replaced even though they did not necessarily want Thatcher to replace him.\nOn 4 February 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the first ballot by 130 votes to 119, with Fraser coming in a distant third with 16 votes. This was not a big enough margin to give Thatcher the 15% majority necessary to win on the first ballot, but having finished in second place Heath immediately resigned and did not contest the next ballot. His favoured candidate, William Whitelaw, lost to Thatcher in the second vote one week later (Thatcher 146, Whitelaw 79, Howe 19, Prior 19, Peyton 11). The vote polarised along right-left lines, with in addition the region, experience and education of the MP having their effects. Heath and Whitelaw were stronger on the left, among Oxbridge and public school graduates, and in MPs from Northern England or Scotland.\nThatcher had promised Heath a seat in the Shadow Cabinet and planned to offer him whatever post he wanted. His advisors agreed he should wait at least six months, so he declined. He never relented and his refusal was called \"the incredible sulk\". Thatcher visited Heath at his home shortly after her election as leader and had to stay for coffee with his PPS Timothy Kitson so the waiting press would not realise how brief the visit had been. Heath claimed that he had simply declined her request for advice about how to handle the press, whilst Thatcher claimed that she offered him any Shadow Cabinet position he wanted and asked him to lead the Conservative campaign in the imminent EEC referendum, only to be rudely rebuffed.\nLater career (1975\u20132001).\nFor many years, Heath persisted in criticism of the party's new ideological direction. At the time of his defeat, he was still popular with rank-and-file Conservative members and was warmly applauded at the 1975 Conservative Party Conference. He played a leading role in the 1975 referendum campaign in which the UK voted to remain part of the EEC, and he remained active on the international stage, serving on the Brandt Commission investigation into developmental issues, particularly on North\u2013South projects (Brandt Report).\nHis relations with Thatcher remained poor, and in 1979\u201380, he turned down her offers of the positions of Ambassador to the United States and Secretary General of NATO. He continued as a central figure on the left of the party and, at the 1981 Conservative Party conference, openly criticised the government's economic policy of monetarism, which had seen inflation rise from 13% in 1979 to 18% in 1980 then fall to 4% by 1983, but had seen unemployment double from around 1.5\u00a0million to a postwar high of 3.3\u00a0million during that time.\nIn 1990, he flew to Baghdad to attempt to negotiate the release of aircraft passengers on British Airways Flight 149 and other British nationals taken hostage when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. After the events of Black Wednesday in 1992, he stated in the House of Commons that government should build a fund of reserves to counter currency speculators.\nIn 1987, he was nominated in the election for the Chancellorship of the University of Oxford but lost to Roy Jenkins as a result of splitting the Conservative vote with Lord Blake.\nHeath continued to serve as a backbench MP for the London constituency of Old Bexley and Sidcup and was, from 1992, the longest-serving MP (\"Father of the House\") and the oldest British MP. As Father of the House, he oversaw the election of two Speakers of the Commons, Betty Boothroyd and Michael Martin. Heath was created a Knight Companion of the Garter on 23 April 1992. He retired from Parliament at the 2001 general election. Heath and Tony Benn were the last two serving MPs to have been elected during the reign of George\u00a0VI, with Heath serving continuously since 1950.\nHeath maintained business links with several companies including a Saudi think tank, two investment funds and a Chinese freight operator, mainly as an adviser on China or a member of the governing board. According to Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong, his commercial interests in China could have been one of the reasons why he denounced the democratic reforms introduced in the run-up to the handover of Hong Kong.\nParliament broke with precedent by commissioning a bust of Heath while he was still alive. Commentators have noted how the statue of Margaret Thatcher appears to overshadow Heath's bust. The 1993 bronze work, by Martin Jennings, was moved to the Members' Lobby in 2002. On 29 April 2002, in his eighty-sixth year, he made a public appearance at Downing Street alongside the then\u2013prime minister Tony Blair and the three other surviving former prime ministers at the time (James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major), as well as relatives of deceased prime ministers, for a dinner which was part of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II. This was to be one of his last public appearances, as the following year saw a decline in his health.\nPersonal life.\nPrivate residence.\nIn the 1960s, Heath had lived in Albany, off Piccadilly; at the unexpected end of his premiership, the French couple living there refused his demand that they move out so that he could have his flat back (\"So much for European Unity!\" Heath later wrote in his memoirs). For four months, Heath took the flat of Conservative MP Timothy Kitson; Kitson declined his offer to pay rent but later recalled an occasion when his own watch broke, and Heath in response invited him to take one of a large collection that he had been given on his travels. In July 1974, the Duke of Westminster, a major London landowner and ardent Europhile, allowed Heath to rent a property in Wilton Street, Belgravia, for an annual rent of \u00a31,250 (\u00a3 at 2023 prices), a tenth of the market value. The house had three storeys and a basement flat for Heath's housekeeper, and he continued to use it as his London home until old age prevented him from climbing the stairs.\nIn February 1985, Heath acquired a Wiltshire home, Arundells, in the Cathedral close at Salisbury, where he resided until his death twenty years later. In January 2006, it was announced that Heath had placed his house and contents, valued at \u00a35\u00a0million in his will, in a charitable foundation, the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, to conserve the house as a museum to his career. The house is open to the public for guided tours from March to October; displayed therein is a large collection of personal effects as well as Heath's personal library, photo collections, and paintings by Winston Churchill.\nIn his will, Heath, who had no descendants, left only two legacies: \u00a320,000 to his brother's widow, and \u00a32,500 to his housekeeper.\nYachting.\nHeath was a keen yachtsman. He bought his first yacht \"Morning Cloud\" in 1969 and won the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race that year. He captained Britain's winning team for the Admiral's Cup in 1971 \u2013 while prime minister \u2013 and also captained the team in the 1979 Fastnet Race. He was a member of the Broadstairs Sailing Club, where he learnt to sail on a Snipe and a Fireball before moving on to success in larger boats.\nClassical music.\nHeath maintained an interest in classical music as a pianist, organist and orchestral conductor, famously installing a Steinway grand in 10\u00a0Downing Street \u2013 bought with his \u00a3450 Charlemagne Prize money, awarded for his unsuccessful efforts to bring Britain into the EEC in 1963, and chosen on the advice of his friend, the pianist Moura Lympany \u2013 and conducting Christmas carol concerts in Broadstairs every year from his teens until old age.\nHeath conducted the London Symphony Orchestra, notably at a gala concert at the Royal Festival Hall in November 1971, at which he conducted Sir Edward Elgar's overture \"Cockaigne (In London Town)\". He also conducted the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra, as well as orchestras in Germany and the United States. During his premiership, Heath invited musician friends, such as Isaac Stern, Yehudi Menuhin, Clifford Curzon and the Amadeus Quartet, to perform either at Chequers or 10 Downing Street. Heath was the founding President of the European Community Youth Orchestra (in 1976), now the European Union Youth Orchestra.\nIn 1988, Heath recorded Beethoven's Triple Concerto, Op.\u00a056 (with members of the Trio Zingara as soloists) and Boccherini's Cello Concerto in G major, G480.\nFootball.\nHeath was a supporter of the Lancashire football club Burnley, and just after the end of his term as prime minister in 1974 he opened the \u00a3450,000 Bob Lord Stand at the club's Turf Moor stadium.\nAuthor.\nHeath wrote several books in the second half of the 1970s: \"Sailing\", \"Music\", and \"Travels\". He also compiled a collection of carols called \"The Joy of Christmas\", published in 1978 by Oxford University Press, which contained the music and lyrics to a wide variety of Christmas carols, each accompanied by a reproduction of a piece of religious art and a short introduction by Heath.\nHeath's autobiography, \"The Course of My Life\", appeared in 1998. According to his obituary in \"The Daily Telegraph\", this \"had involved dozens of researchers and writers (some of whom he never paid) over many years\".\n\"Grocer Heath\".\nIn 1964, despite substantial opposition from many Conservative MPs and independent grocers and shopkeepers, Heath led a successful fight to abolish resale price maintenance.\n\"Private Eye\", a satirical current affairs magazine, thereupon persistently ridiculed him as \"Grocer Heath\". The magazine also parodied him as the managing director of a struggling small company, \"Heathco\". The nickname was coined as a parody of Keith West's 1967 hit single \"Excerpt from A Teenage Opera\", which features the phrase \"Grocer Jack\" sung during its refrain.\nSexuality.\nHeath never married. He had been expected to marry childhood friend Kay Raven, who was reportedly tired of waiting and married an RAF officer whom she met on holiday in 1950. In a four-sentence paragraph of his memoirs, Heath claimed that he had been too busy establishing a career after the war and had \"perhaps\u00a0... taken too much for granted\". In a 1998 TV interview with Michael Cockerell, Heath said that he had kept her photograph in his flat for many years afterwards.\nHis interest in music kept him on friendly terms with female musicians, including pianist Moura Lympany. When Heath was prime minister she was approached by the Conservative MP Tufton Beamish, who said: \"Moura, Ted must get married. Will you marry him?\" She said she would have done but was in love with someone else. She later said the most intimate thing Heath had done was to put his arm around her shoulder.\nBernard Levin wrote at the time in \"The Observer\" that the UK had to wait until the emergence of the permissive society for a prime minister who was a virgin. In later life, according to his official biographer Philip Ziegler, at dinner parties Heath was \"apt to relapse into morose silence or completely ignore the woman next to him and talk across her to the nearest man\"; others at the time claimed Heath was just not talkative at parties.\nThere were many innuendos in \"Private Eye\" about it and chants insinuating he was homosexual could be heard outside Downing Street during protests by trade unionists against his Industrial Relations Bill.\nJohn Campbell, who published a biography of Heath in 1993, devoted four pages to a discussion of the evidence concerning Heath's sexuality. While acknowledging that Heath was often assumed by the public to be gay, not least because it is \"nowadays\u00a0... whispered of any bachelor\", he found \"no positive evidence\" that this was so \"except for the faintest unsubstantiated rumour\" (the footnote refers to a mention of a \"disturbing incident\" at the beginning of the Second World War in a 1972 biography by Andrew Roth). Campbell ultimately concluded that the most significant aspect of Heath's sexuality was his complete repression of it.\nBrian Coleman, the Conservative Party London Assembly member for Barnet and Camden, claimed in 2007 that Heath, to protect his career, had stopped cottaging in the 1950s. Coleman said it was \"common knowledge\" among Conservatives that Heath had been given a stern warning by police when he underwent background checks for the post of privy counsellor. Heath's biographer Philip Ziegler wrote in 2010 that Coleman was able to provide \"little or no information\" to back up this statement, that no man had ever claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Heath, nor was any trace of homosexuality to be found in his papers, and that \"those who knew him well\" insist that he had no such inclination. He believes Heath to have been asexual, although he does mention a letter from one \"Freddy\", who seems hurt that \"Teddie\" had spurned his advances (chapter 2 of his book).\nLord Armstrong of Ilminster, who was Heath's friend and former private secretary, stated his belief that Heath was asexual, saying that he \"never detected a whiff of sexuality in relation to men, women or children.\" Another friend and confidant, Sara Morrison, former vice-chairman of the Conservative Party, said Heath had \"effectively\" told her \"that he was sexless\". Charles Moore, in his authorised biography of Margaret Thatcher, said that Bill Deedes believed that Thatcher \"seem[ed] convinced\" Heath was gay, whilst Moore believed it is \"possible\" that Thatcher's reference, in interview in 1974, to Heath not having a family, was a deliberate hint that he was gay, in order to discredit him. Thatcher certainly seems to have disliked Heath. \"When I look at him and he looks at me,\" she once remarked, according to Ziegler (Chapter 4), \"it doesn't feel like a man looking at a woman, more like a woman looking at another woman.\"\nWhen he moved to Arundells in 1985, Heath hired Derek Frost, life partner of Jeremy Norman, to modernise and redecorate the house in Salisbury. He became friends with the couple, though never close. When they asked Heath why he had not supported homosexual law reform (he was either absent from the debates in the 1960s or voted against Lord Arran's first Bill in May 1965), he replied that he had always been in favour but that \"the rank and file of the party would never have stood for it.\" Norman's view is that Heath was \"a deeply closeted gay man\" who \"decided early in life to sublimate his sexuality to his political ambitions.\" In later life, Heath voted for the lowering of the age of same-sex consent to eighteen and then sixteen.\nSimilarly, Michael McManus, who was Heath's private secretary in the 1990s and helped with his memoirs, writes in his book on gay conservative politicians that he \"was left in no doubt whatsoever that Heath was a gay man who had sacrificed his personal life to his political career, exercising iron self-control and living a celibate existence as he climbed the 'greasy pole' of preferment.\"\nAllegations of child sexual abuse.\nIn April 2015, a rape claim against Heath was investigated by the Metropolitan Police but was dropped. In August 2015, several police forces were investigating allegations of child sexual abuse by Heath. Hampshire, Jersey, Kent, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Thames Valley constabularies and London's Metropolitan Police investigated such claims. It was reported that a man had claimed that at the age of 12 years he had been raped by Heath in a Mayfair flat in 1961, after he had run away from home. Allegations about Heath were investigated as part of Operation Midland, the Metropolitan Police inquiry into claims of historic child abuse and related homicides. A witness called \"Nick\" was introduced to the police by the former \"Exaro\" website, who had asked him about alleged child sexual abuse by prominent figures at the Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico, London; Heath was reported to be one of the figures. In 2018 \"Nick\", whose real name is Carl Beech, was arrested and charged over child pornography offences and in January 2019 he pleaded guilty. Beech, who had fabricated allegations against Heath and other prominent politicians and civil servants, was sentenced in July 2019 to eighteen years in prison.\nAlso in August 2015, Sky News reported that Jersey police were investigating allegations against Heath as part of Operation Whistle, and a similar investigation, Operation Conifer, was launched by Wiltshire Police at the same time. The Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, which operates the museum at Arundells, his home in Salisbury, said it welcomed the investigation. In November 2016, criminologist Richard Hoskins said that the evidence used against Heath in Operation Conifer, including discredited allegations of satanic ritual abuse, was \"preposterous\", \"fantastical\" and gained through the \"controversial\" practice of recovered-memory therapy. Operation Conifer was closed in March 2017, having cost a reported \u00a31.5\u00a0million over two years, as no corroborating evidence had been found in any of the 42 allegations by 40 individuals (including three different names used by one person).\nIn September 2017, it was announced that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse would review the police investigation into Heath. Police said that if Heath were still alive they would have interviewed him under caution in relation to seven out of the 42 allegations, but nothing should be inferred about his guilt or innocence. In his summary report, Chief Constable Mike Veale confirmed that \"no further corroborative evidence was found\" to support the satanic abuse claims.\nIllness and death.\nIn August 2003, at the age of 87, Heath suffered a pulmonary embolism while on holiday in Salzburg, Austria. He never fully recovered, and owing to his declining health and mobility made very few public appearances in the last two years of his life. His last appearance was at the unveiling of a set of gates at St Paul's Cathedral dedicated to Churchill on 30 November 2004.\nIn his final public statement, Heath paid tribute to James Callaghan, who died on 26 March 2005, saying \"James Callaghan was a major fixture in the political life of this country during his long and varied career. When in opposition he never hesitated to put firmly his party's case. When in office he took a smoother approach towards his supporters and opponents alike. Although he left the House of Commons in 1987 he continued to follow political life and it was always a pleasure to meet with him. We have lost a major figure from our political landscape.\"\nJust under four months later, Heath died at his home from pneumonia at 7.30\u00a0pm on 17 July 2005, at the age of 89, the day after his spokesman said he was \"nearing the end of his life\". He was cremated on 25 July 2005 at a funeral service attended by 1,500 people. On the day after his death, the BBC Parliament channel showed the BBC results coverage of the 1970 election. A memorial service was held for Heath in Westminster Abbey on 8 November 2005, which was attended by 2,000 people. Three days later his ashes were interred in Salisbury Cathedral. In a tribute to him, the then-prime minister Tony Blair stated \"He was a man of great integrity and beliefs he held firmly from which he never wavered\".\nHonours.\nHeath received several accolades and honours.\nHonorary degrees and fellowships.\nHeath was awarded a number of honorary degrees:\nAwards.\nIncluding the year of award.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was Leader of the Labour Party from 1963 to 1976, Leader of the Opposition twice from 1963 to 1964 and again from 1970 to 1974, and a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1945 to 1983. Wilson is the only Labour leader to have formed governments following four general elections.\nBorn in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, to a politically active lower middle-class family, Wilson studied philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford. He was later an Economic History lecturer at New College, Oxford, and a research fellow at University College, Oxford. Elected to Parliament in 1945, Wilson was appointed to the Attlee government as a Parliamentary secretary; he became Secretary for Overseas Trade in 1947, and was elevated to the Cabinet shortly thereafter as President of the Board of Trade. Following Labour's defeat at the 1955 election, Wilson joined the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Chancellor, and was moved to the role of Shadow Foreign Secretary in 1961. When Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell died in January 1963, Wilson won the leadership election to replace him, becoming Leader of the Opposition.\nWilson led Labour to a narrow victory at the 1964 election. His first period as prime minister saw a period of low unemployment and economic prosperity; this was however hindered by significant problems with Britain's external balance of payments. His government oversaw significant societal changes, abolishing both capital punishment and theatre censorship, partially decriminalising male homosexuality in England and Wales, relaxing the divorce laws, limiting immigration, outlawing racial discrimination, and liberalising birth control and abortion law. In the midst of this programme, Wilson called a snap election in 1966, which Labour won with a much increased majority. His government armed Nigeria during the Biafran War. In 1969, he sent British troops to Northern Ireland. After unexpectedly losing the 1970 election to Edward Heath's Conservatives, Wilson chose to remain in the Labour leadership, and resumed the role of Leader of the Opposition for four years before leading Labour through the February 1974 election, which resulted in a hung parliament. Wilson was appointed prime minister for a second time; he called a snap election in October 1974, which gave Labour a small majority. During his second term as prime minister, Wilson oversaw the referendum that confirmed the UK's membership of the European Communities. In 1975, his government set up the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention as an attempt to deal with constitutional issues surrounding the status of Northern Ireland. While out of office in late 1971, Wilson had formulated a 15-year programme that was designed to pave the way for the unification of Ireland.\nIn March 1976, Wilson suddenly resigned as prime minister. He remained in the House of Commons until retiring in 1983 when he was elevated to the House of Lords as Lord Wilson of Rievaulx. While seen by admirers as leading the Labour Party through difficult political issues with considerable skill, Wilson's reputation was low when he left office and is still disputed in historiography. Some scholars praise his unprecedented electoral success for a Labour prime minister and holistic approach to governance, while others criticise his political style and handling of economic issues. Several key issues which he faced while prime minister included the role of public ownership, whether Britain should seek the membership of the European Communities, and British involvement in the Vietnam War. His stated ambitions of substantially improving Britain's long-term economic performance, applying technology more democratically, and reducing inequality were to some extent unfulfilled.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nJames Harold Wilson was born at Warneford Road, Cowlersley, in the western suburbs of the mill town of Huddersfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, on 11 March 1916. He came from a political family: his father James Herbert Wilson was a works chemist who had been active in the Liberal Party, serving as Winston Churchill's deputy election agent in a 1908 by-election, but later joined the Labour Party. His mother Ethel (\"n\u00e9e\" Seddon) was a schoolteacher before her marriage; in 1901 her brother Harold Seddon settled in Western Australia and became the 8th President of the Western Australian Legislative Council in 1946. When Wilson was eight, he visited London and a much-reproduced photograph was taken of him standing on the doorstep of 10 Downing Street. At the age of ten, he went with his family to Australia, where he became fascinated with the pomp and glamour of politics. On the way home, he told his mother, \"I am going to be prime minister.\"\nEducation.\nWilson won a scholarship to attend Royds Hall Grammar School in Huddersfield, Yorkshire. His father, working as an industrial chemist, was made redundant in December 1930, and it took him nearly two years to find work; he moved to Spital, on the Wirral Peninsula, to do so. Wilson continued his education in the Sixth Form at the Wirral Grammar School for Boys, where he became Head Boy.\nWilson did well at school and, although he missed getting a scholarship, he obtained an exhibition; this, when topped up by a county grant, enabled him to study at Jesus College, Oxford, from 1934. At Oxford, Wilson was moderately active in politics as a member of the Liberal Party but was strongly influenced by G. D. H. Cole. His politics tutor, R. B. McCallum, considered Wilson to be the best student he ever had. He graduated in PPE (philosophy, politics and economics) with \"an outstanding first class Bachelor of Arts degree, with alphas on every paper\" in the final examinations, and a series of major academic awards. Biographer Roy Jenkins wrote:\nAcademically his results put him among prime ministers in the category of Peel, Gladstone, Asquith, and no one else. But...he lacked originality. What he was superb at was the quick assimilation of knowledge, combined with an ability to keep it ordered in his mind and to present it lucidly in a form welcome to his examiners.\nHe continued in academia, becoming a research assistant to William Beveridge in the late-1930s, he also found work lecturing part-time at University College from 1938.\nWar service.\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War, Wilson volunteered for military service, but was classed as a specialist and moved into the civil service instead. For much of this time, he was a research assistant to William Beveridge, the Master of University College, working on the issues of unemployment and the trade cycle. Wilson later became a statistician and economist for the coal industry. He was Director of Economics and Statistics at the Ministry of Fuel and Power in 1943\u201344 and was made an OBE for his services.\nHe was to remain passionately interested in statistics, becoming a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in 1943. As President of the Board of Trade, he was the driving force behind the Statistics of Trade Act 1947, which is still the authority governing most economic statistics in Britain. He was instrumental as prime minister in appointing Claus Moser as head of the Central Statistical Office, and was president of the Royal Statistical Society between 1972 and 1973.\nMember of Parliament (1945\u20131947).\nAs the war drew to an end, he searched for a seat to contest at the impending general election. He was selected for the constituency of Ormskirk, then held by Stephen King-Hall. Wilson agreed to be adopted as the candidate immediately rather than delay until the election was called, and was therefore compelled to resign from his position in the Civil Service. He served as Praelector in Economics at University College between his resignation and his election to the House of Commons. He also used this time to write \"A New Deal for Coal\", which used his wartime experience to argue for the nationalisation of the coal mines on the grounds of the improved efficiency he predicted would ensue.\nIn the 1945 general election, Wilson won his seat in the Labour landslide. To his surprise, he was immediately appointed to the government by Prime Minister Clement Attlee as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works. Two years later, he became Secretary for Overseas Trade, in which capacity he made several official trips to the Soviet Union to negotiate supply contracts.\nThe boundaries of his Ormskirk constituency were significantly altered before the general election of 1950. He stood instead for the new seat of Huyton near Liverpool, and was narrowly elected; he served there for 33 years until 1983.\nCabinet minister, 1947\u20131951.\nBonfire of controls.\nWilson was appointed President of the Board of Trade on 29 September 1947, becoming, at the age of 31, the youngest member of a British Cabinet in the 20th century. Initially Wilson favoured a more interventionist policy, seeking requirements for government officials to be seated on private boards of directors, further price controls, and nationalisations of private industries which opposed government policy. However, he abandoned these plans after his colleagues disagreed. He made it a priority to reduce wartime rationing, which he referred to as a \"bonfire of controls\". Wilson decided that the massive number of wartime controls was slowing the conversion to peacetime prosperity and he was committed to removing them as fast as possible. He ended rationing of potatoes, bread and jam, as well as shoes and some other clothing controls.\nIn November 1948 Wilson's Board of Trade removed the need for over 200,000 licences and permits. By March 1949 he promised to remove the need for another 900,000, although meat remained in short supply and was still rationed, as was petrol. Henry Irvine argues that Wilson's success with the bonfire of controls established his reputation as a modernizing specialist, with both the general public and the political elite. Irving also argues that the selection timing and especially the publicity Wilson devoted to the bonfire represented the emerging skills of a brilliant young politician. While each major bonfire was justified in terms of technical economic advantages, it was selected and publicised widely to reach the largest possible audience so that everybody could understand that their bread and jam became free again.\nThree ambitious young men.\nIn mid-1949, with Chancellor of the Exchequer Stafford Cripps having gone to Switzerland in an attempt to recover his health, Wilson was one of a group of three young ministers, all of them former economics dons and wartime civil servants, convened to advise Prime Minister Attlee on financial matters. The others were Douglas Jay (Economic Secretary to the Treasury) and Hugh Gaitskell (Minister of Fuel and Power), both of whom soon grew to distrust him. Jay wrote of Wilson's role in the debates over whether or not to devalue sterling that \"he changed sides three times within eight days and finished up facing both ways\". Wilson was given the task during his Swiss holiday of taking a letter to Cripps informing him of the decision to devalue, to which Cripps had been opposed. Wilson had tarnished his reputation in both political and official circles. Although a successful minister, he was regarded as self-important. He was not seriously considered for the job of Chancellor when Cripps stepped down in October 1950\u2014it was given to Gaitskell\u2014possibly in part because of his cautious role during devaluation.\nWilson was becoming known in the Labour Party as a left-winger, and joined Aneurin Bevan and John Freeman in resigning from the government in April 1951 in protest at the introduction of National Health Service (NHS) medical charges to meet the financial demands imposed by the Korean War. At this time, Wilson was not yet regarded as a heavyweight politician: Hugh Dalton referred to him scornfully as \"Nye [Bevan]'s dog\".\nAfter Labour lost the 1951 election, he became the Chairman of Keep Left, Bevan's political group. At the bitter Morecambe Conference in late 1952, Wilson was one of the Bevanites elected as constituency representatives to Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC), whilst senior right-wingers such as Dalton and Herbert Morrison were voted off.\nIn Opposition (1951\u20131964).\nShadow Cabinet, 1954\u20131963.\nWilson had never made much secret that his support of the left-wing Aneurin Bevan was opportunistic. In early 1954, Bevan resigned from the Shadow Cabinet (elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) over Labour's support for the setting-up of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Wilson, who had been runner-up in the elections, stepped up to fill the vacant place. He was supported in this by Richard Crossman, but his actions angered Bevan and the other Bevanites.\nWilson's course in intra-party matters in the 1950s and early 1960s left him neither fully accepted nor trusted by the left or the right in the Labour Party. Despite his earlier association with Bevan, in 1955 he backed Hugh Gaitskell, the right-wing candidate in internal Labour Party terms, against Bevan for the party leadership election. Gaitskell appointed him Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1955, and he proved to be very effective. One of his procedural moves caused a substantial delay to the progress of the Government's Finance Bill in 1955, and his speeches as Shadow Chancellor from 1956 were widely praised for their clarity and wit. He coined the term \"Gnomes of Zurich\" to ridicule Swiss bankers for selling Britain short and pushing the pound sterling down by speculation. He conducted an inquiry into the Labour Party's organisation following its defeat in the 1955 general election; its report compared Labour's organisation to an antiquated penny-farthing bicycle, and made various recommendations for improvements. Unusually, Wilson combined the job of Chairman of the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee with that of Shadow Chancellor from 1959, holding that position until 1963.\nGaitskell's leadership was weakened following the Labour Party's 1959 defeat, his controversial attempt to ditch Labour's commitment to nationalisation by scrapping Clause IV, and his defeat at the 1960 Party Conference over a motion supporting unilateral nuclear disarmament. Bevan had died in July 1960, so Wilson established himself as a leader of the Labour left by launching an opportunistic but unsuccessful challenge to Gaitskell's leadership in November 1960. Wilson would later be moved to the position of Shadow Foreign Secretary in 1961, before he challenged for the deputy leadership in 1962 but was defeated by George Brown.\nOpposition Leader, 1963\u201364.\nGaitskell died in January 1963, just as the Labour Party had begun to unite and appeared to have a very good chance of winning the next election, with the Macmillan Government running into trouble. Timothy Heppell has explored how Wilson won the Labour Party leadership election. Wilson had alienated the right wing of the party by his angry attempts to defeat Gaitskell in 1960 for the leadership, and George Brown in 1962 for the deputy leadership. These misadventures gave Wilson a reputation for disloyalty and divisiveness. Heppell identifies three factors whereby Wilson overcame these disadvantages. Firstly, he had united the party's left wing behind him and they showed no willingness to compromise. Secondly, the right wing, although more numerous, was deeply split between Brown and James Callaghan. Wilson took the lead on the first ballot and gained momentum on the second. Finally, Brown proved a poor campaigner, emphasizing divisive factors rather than his own credentials, allowing Wilson to emerge, surprisingly, as the unity candidate, thus becoming the Leader of the Labour Party and the Leader of the Opposition.\nAt the party's 1963 annual conference, Wilson made his best-remembered speech, on the implications of scientific and technological change. He argued that \"the Britain that is going to be forged in the white heat of this revolution will be no place for restrictive practices or for outdated measures on either side of industry\". This speech did much to set Wilson's reputation as a technocrat not tied to the prevailing class system.\nLabour's 1964 election campaign was aided by the Profumo affair, a ministerial sex scandal that had mortally wounded Harold Macmillan and hurt the Conservatives. Wilson made capital without getting involved in the less salubrious aspects. (Asked for a statement on the scandal, he reportedly said \"No comment\u00a0... in glorious Technicolor!\"). Sir Alec Douglas-Home was an aristocrat who had given up his peerage to sit in the House of Commons and become prime minister upon Macmillan's resignation. To Wilson's comment that he was out of touch with ordinary people since he was the 14th Earl of Home, Home retorted, \"I suppose Mr. Wilson is the fourteenth Mr. Wilson\".\nFirst premiership (1964\u20131970).\nAppointment.\nLabour won the 1964 general election with a narrow majority of four seats, and Wilson became prime minister, at 48 the youngest person to hold that office since Lord Rosebery 70 years earlier. During 1965, by-election losses reduced the government's majority to a single seat; but in March 1966 Wilson took the gamble of calling another general election. The gamble paid off, because this time Labour achieved a 96-seat majority over the Conservatives, who the previous year had made Edward Heath their leader.\nDomestic affairs.\nThe 1964\u20131970 Labour government carried out a broad range of reforms during its time in office, in such areas as social security, civil liberties, housing, health, education, and worker's rights.\nEconomic policies.\nWilson's government put faith in economic planning as a way to solve Britain's economic problems. The government's strategy involved setting up a Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) which would draw up a National Plan which was intended to promote growth and investment. Wilson believed that scientific progress was the key to economic and social advancement, as such he famously referred to the \"white heat of technology\", in reference to the modernisation of British industry. This was to be achieved through a new Ministry of Technology (shortened to \"Mintech\") which would coordinate research and development and support the swift adoption of new technology by industry, aided by government-funded infrastructure improvements.\nIn practice, however, events derailed much of the initial optimism. Upon coming to power, the government was informed that they had inherited an exceptionally large deficit of \u00a3800 million on Britain's balance of trade. This partly reflected the preceding government's expansive fiscal policy in the run-up to the 1964 election. Immediately the pound came under enormous pressure, and many economists advocated devaluation of the pound in response, but Wilson resisted, reportedly in part out of concern that Labour, which had previously devalued sterling in 1949, would become tagged as \"the party of devaluation\". Wilson also believed that a devaluation would disproportionately harm low-income Britons with savings and poorer Commonwealth of Nations countries in the sterling area. The government instead opted to deal with the problem by imposing a temporary surcharge on imports, and a series of deflationary measures designed to reduce demand and therefore the inflow of imports. In the latter half of 1967, an attempt was made to prevent the recession in activity from going too far in the form of a stimulus to consumer durable spending through an easing of credit, which in turn prevented a rise in unemployment.\nFollowing a costly battle, market pressures forced the government to devalue the pound by 14% from $2.80 to $2.40 in November 1967. Wilson was much criticised for a broadcast soon after in which he assured listeners that the \"pound in your pocket\" had not lost its value. Economic performance did show some improvement after the devaluation, as economists had predicted. The devaluation, with accompanying austerity measures which ensured resources went into exports rather than domestic consumption, successfully restored the trade balance to surplus by 1970. In retrospect Wilson has been widely criticised for not devaluing earlier, however, he believed there were strong arguments against it, including the fear that it would set off a round of competitive devaluations, and concern about the impact price rises following a devaluation would have on people on low incomes.\nThe government's decision over its first three years to defend sterling's parity with traditional deflationary measures ran counter to hopes for an expansionist push for growth. The National Plan produced by the DEA in 1965 targeted an annual growth rate of 3.8%, however, under the restrained circumstances the actual average rate of growth between 1964 and 1970 was a far more modest 2.2%. The DEA itself was wound up in 1969. The government's other main initiative Mintech did have some success at switching research and development spending from military to civilian purposes, and of achieving increases in industrial productivity, although persuading industry to adopt new technology proved more difficult than had been hoped.\nThe continued relevance of industrial nationalisation (a centrepiece of the post-War Labour government's programme) had been a key point of contention in Labour's internal struggles of the 1950s and early 1960s. Wilson's predecessor as leader, Hugh Gaitskell, had tried in 1960 to tackle the controversy head-on, with a proposal to expunge Clause Four (the public ownership clause) from the party's constitution, but had been forced to climb down. Wilson took a characteristically more subtle approach: No significant expansion of public ownership took place under Wilson's government, however, he placated the party's left-wing by renationalising the steel industry under the Iron and Steel Act 1967 (which had been denationalised by the Conservatives in the 1950s) creating the British Steel Corporation.\nWilson's government presided over a rate of unemployment which was low by historic (and later) standards but did rise during his period in office. Between 1964 and 1966 the average rate of unemployment was 1.6%, while between 1966 and 1970 the average stood at 2.5%. He had entered power at a time when unemployment stood at around 400,000. It still stood at 371,000 by early 1966 after a steady fall during 1965, but by March 1967 it stood at 631,000. It fell again towards the end of the decade, standing at 582,000 by the time of the general election in June 1970.\nSocial reforms.\nWilson's government is perhaps best remembered for its liberal social reforms, notable amongst these was the Race Relations Act 1965 which was the first piece of legislation to address race relations and racial discrimination, the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 which abolished capital punishment (except for a small number of offences\u00a0\u2014 notably high treason) the Sexual Offences Act 1967, which partially decriminalised male homosexuality and the Abortion Act 1967, which legalised abortion, the abolition of theatre censorship by the Theatres Act 1968, and the liberalisation of divorce law by the Divorce Reform Act 1969. While many of these measures were introduced as private member's bills, and given a free vote, the government effectively supported them by giving them parliamentary time, this was especially true during Roy Jenkins' tenure as Home Secretary (1965\u20131967), with whom the liberal reform agenda is particularly associated. Wilson personally, coming culturally from a provincial non-conformist background, showed no particular enthusiasm for much of this agenda.\nEducation.\nHigher education held special significance for a Labourite of Wilson's generation, given its role in both opening up opportunities for ambitious youth from working-class backgrounds and enabling Britain to seize the potential benefits of scientific advances. Under the first Wilson government, for the first time in British history, more money was allocated to education than to defence. Wilson continued the rapid creation of new universities, in line with the recommendations of the Robbins Report, a bipartisan policy already in train when Labour took power.\nWilson's government created the Open University, to give adults who had missed out on tertiary education a second chance through part-time study and distance learning. \nWilson's record on secondary education was motivated by growing pressure for the abolition of the selective principle underlying the \"eleven-plus\", and replacement with comprehensive schools which would serve the full range of children (see the article 'grammar schools debate'). Comprehensive education became Labour Party policy. From 1966 to 1970, the proportion of children in comprehensive schools increased from about 10% to over 30%.\nIn 1968, Wilson's first government reluctantly decided it could not fulfil its long-held promise to raise the school leaving age to 16, because budget cuts left it unable to fulfil the investment required in infrastructure, such as tens of thousands of new classrooms and teachers.\nOverall, public expenditure on education rose as a proportion of GNP from 4.8% in 1964 to 5.9% in 1968, and the number of teachers in training increased by more than a third between 1964 and 1967. The percentage of students staying on at school after the age of sixteen increased similarly, and the student population increased by over 10% each year. Pupil-teacher ratios were also steadily reduced. As a result of the first Wilson government's educational policies, opportunities for the working-class were improved; overall access to education in 1970 was broader than in 1964.\nHousing.\nHousing was a major policy area under the first Wilson government. During Wilson's time in office from 1964 to 1970, more new houses were built than in the last six years of the previous Conservative government. The proportion of council housing rose from 42% to 50% of the total, while the number of council homes built increased steadily, from 119,000 in 1964 to 133,000 in 1965 and 142,000 in 1966. Allowing for demolitions, 1.3\u00a0million new homes were built between 1965 and 1970, although concerns were raised about the quality of much of the new housing, which was often cheaply built high-rise stock (the latter came in for particular criticism following the Ronan Point collapse in 1968).\nTo encourage homeownership, the government introduced the Option Mortgage Scheme (1968), which made low-income housebuyers eligible for subsidies (equivalent to tax relief on mortgage interest payments). This scheme had the effect of reducing housing costs for buyers on low incomes and enabling more people to become owner-occupiers. In addition, house owners were exempted from capital gains tax. Together with the Option Mortgage Scheme, this measure stimulated the private housing market. Wilson in a 1967 speech said: \"..the grime and muddle and decay of our Victorian heritage is being replaced. The new city centres with their university precincts, their light, clean and well-spaced civic buildings, will not merely brighten the physical environment of our people, they will change the very quality of urban life in Britain.\"\nSignificant emphasis was also placed on town planning, with new conservation areas introduced and a new generation of new towns built, notably Milton Keynes. The New Towns Acts of 1965 and 1968 together gave the government the authority (through its ministries) to designate any area of land as a site for a new town.\nSocial Services and welfare.\nWilson's government carried out a merger between the National Assistance Board and the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance to create the Ministry of Social Security. Wilson's government carried out increases in a number of benefits; family allowances were more than doubled in money terms, whilst redundancy payments were introduced in 1965.\nPrescription charges for medicines were abolished immediately following Labour's 1964 election victory, while pensions were raised to a record 21% of average male industrial wages. Before the 1966 election, the widow's pension was tripled. Due to austerity measures following an economic crisis, prescription charges were re-introduced in 1968 as an alternative to cutting the hospital building programme, although those sections of the population who were most in need (including supplementary benefit claimants, the long-term sick, children, and pensioners) were exempted from charges.\nIn the five years from 1964 up until the last increases made by the First Wilson Government, pensions went up by 23% in real terms, supplementary benefits by 26% in real terms, and sickness and unemployment benefits by 153% in real terms (largely as a result of the introduction of earnings-related benefits in 1967).\nNorthern Ireland.\nWilson's first premiership was marked by the emerging conflict in Northern Ireland: like all British governments since the partition of Ireland in 1921, Harold Wilson's Labour government preferred not to intervene in the affairs of Northern Ireland. However in August 1969, escalating sectarian violence between the province's Protestant and Catholic communities, gave the Government of Northern Ireland little choice but to ask the British government to intervene directly and send in troops, and it was the Home Secretary, James Callaghan, who took the decision to deploy British Army troops in the province. In return Wilson and Callaghan demanded that various reforms be implemented in the province, such as the phasing out of the Protestant paramilitary B-Specials, and their replacement by the Ulster Defence Regiment, which was open to Catholic recruits, and various reforms to reduce discrimination against Catholics, such as reforms to the voting franchise, and a reform of local government boundaries and housing allocations. Although the troops were initially welcomed by Northern Ireland's Catholics, by early 1970 this had soured, and the Provisional IRA emerged, and embarked on what became a decades long violent campaign during what became known as the Troubles.\nInternational development.\nA new Ministry of Overseas Development was established, with its greatest success at the time being the introduction of interest-free loans for the poorest countries. The Minister of Overseas Development, Barbara Castle, set a standard in interest relief on loans to developing nations which resulted in changes to the loan policies of many donor countries, \"a significant shift in the conduct of rich white nations to poor brown ones.\" Loans were introduced to developing countries on terms that were more favourable to them than those given by governments of all other developed countries at that time. In addition, Castle was instrumental in setting up an Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex to devise ways of tackling global socio-economic inequalities. Overseas aid suffered from the austerity measures introduced by the first Wilson government in its last few years in office, with British aid as a percentage of GNP falling from 0.53% in 1964 to 0.39% in 1969.\nTaxation.\nWilson's government made a variety of changes to the tax system. Largely under the influence of the Hungarian-born economists Nicholas Kaldor and Thomas Balogh, an idiosyncratic Selective Employment Tax (SET) was introduced that was designed to tax employment in the service sectors while subsidising employment in manufacturing. (The rationale proposed by its economist authors derived largely from claims about potential economies of scale and technological progress, but Wilson in his memoirs stressed the tax's revenue-raising potential.) The SET did not long survive the return of a Conservative government. Of longer-term significance, capital gains tax (CGT) was introduced across the UK on 6 April 1965.\nVarious changes were also made to the tax system which benefited workers on low and middle incomes. Married couples with low incomes benefited from the increases in the single personal allowance and marriage allowance. In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single personal allowance, marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased. These allowances were further increased in the tax years 1969\u201370 and 1970\u201371. Increases in the age exemption and dependant relative's income limits benefited the low-income elderly. In 1967, new tax concessions were introduced for widows.\nIncreases were made in some of the minor allowances in the 1969 Finance Act, notably the additional personal allowance, the age exemption and age relief and the dependent relative limit. Apart from the age relief, further adjustments in these concessions were implemented in 1970.\n1968 saw the introduction of aggregation of the investment income of unmarried minors with the income of their parents. According to Michael Meacher, this change put an end to a previous inequity whereby two families, in otherwise identical circumstances, paid differing amounts of tax \"simply because in one case the child possessed property transferred to it by a grandparent, while in the other case the grandparent's identical property was inherited by the parent.\"\nIn the 1969 budget, income tax was abolished for about 1 million of the lowest-paid and reduced for a further 600,000 people, while in the government's last budget (introduced in 1970), two million small taxpayers were exempted from paying any income tax altogether.\nIndustrial relations.\nWilson made periodic attempts to mitigate inflation, largely through wage-price controls\u2014better known in Britain as \"prices and incomes policy\". (As with indicative planning, such controls\u2014though now generally out of favour\u2014were widely adopted at that time by governments of different ideological complexions, including the Nixon administration in the United States.) Partly as a result of this reliance, the government tended to find itself repeatedly injected into major industrial disputes, with late-night \"beer and sandwiches at Number Ten\" an almost routine culmination to such episodes. Among the most damaging of the numerous strikes during Wilson's periods in office was a six-week stoppage by the National Union of Seamen, beginning shortly after Wilson's re-election in 1966, and conducted, he claimed, by \"politically motivated men\".\nWith public frustration over strikes mounting, Wilson's government in 1969 proposed a series of changes to the legal basis for industrial relations (labour law), which were outlined in a White Paper \"In Place of Strife\" put forward by the Employment Secretary Barbara Castle. Following a confrontation with the Trades Union Congress, which strongly opposed the proposals, and internal dissent from Home Secretary James Callaghan, the government substantially backed-down from its intentions. The Heath government (1970\u20131974) introduced the Industrial Relations Act 1971 with many of the same ideas, but this was largely repealed by the post-1974 Labour government. Some elements of these changes were subsequently to be enacted (in modified form) during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher.\nForeign affairs.\nUnited States.\nWilson believed in a strong \"Special Relationship\" with the United States and wanted to highlight his dealings with the White House to strengthen his prestige as a statesman. President Lyndon B. Johnson disliked Wilson and ignored any \"special\" relationship. The Vietnam War was a sore point. Johnson needed and asked for help to maintain American prestige. Wilson offered lukewarm verbal support and no military aid. Wilson's policy angered the left-wing of his Labour Party, who opposed the Vietnam War. Wilson and Johnson also differed sharply on British economic weakness and its declining status as a world power. Historian Jonathan Colman concludes it made for the most unsatisfactory \"special\" relationship in the 20th century. The only point of total agreement was that both Johnson and Wilson emphatically supported Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.\nEurope.\nAmong the more challenging political dilemmas Wilson faced was the issue of British membership of the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the present European Union. An entry attempt was vetoed in 1963 by French President Charles de Gaulle. The Labour Party in Opposition had been divided on the issue, with Hugh Gaitskell having come out in 1962 in opposition to Britain joining the European Economic Community. After initial hesitation, Wilson's Government in May 1967 lodged the UK's second application to join the European Economic Community. It was vetoed by de Gaulle in November 1967. After De Gaulle lost power, Conservative prime minister Edward Heath negotiated Britain's admission to the EEC in 1973.\nWilson in opposition showed political ingenuity in devising a position that both sides of the party could agree on, opposing the terms negotiated by Heath but not membership in principle. Labour's 1974 manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then hold a referendum on whether to stay in the EEC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history.\nFollowing Wilson's return to power, the renegotiations with Britain's fellow EC members were carried out by Wilson himself in tandem with Foreign Secretary James Callaghan, and they toured the capital cities of Europe meeting their European counterparts. The discussions focused primarily on Britain's net budgetary contribution to the EEC. As a small agricultural producer heavily dependent on imports, Britain suffered doubly from the dominance of:\n(i) agricultural spending in the EEC budget,\n(ii) agricultural import taxes as a source of EEC revenues.\nDuring the renegotiations, other EEC members conceded, as a partial offset, the establishment of a significant European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), from which it was agreed that Britain would be a major net beneficiary.\nIn the subsequent referendum campaign, rather than the normal British tradition of \"collective responsibility\", under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly, members of the Government were free to present their views on either side of the question. The electorate voted on 5 June 1975 to continue membership, by a substantial majority.\nAsia.\nAmerican military involvement in Vietnam escalated continuously from 1964 to 1968 and President Lyndon B. Johnson brought pressure to bear for at least a token involvement of British military units. Wilson consistently avoided any commitment of British forces, giving as reasons British military commitments to the Malayan Emergency and British co-chairmanship of the 1954 Geneva Conference.\nHis government offered some rhetorical support for the US position (most prominently in the defence offered by the Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart in a much-publicised \"teach-in\" or debate on Vietnam). On at least one occasion the British government made an unsuccessful effort to mediate in the conflict, with Wilson discussing peace proposals with Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers. On 28 June 1966 Wilson 'dissociated' his Government from American bombing of the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. In his memoirs, Wilson writes of \"selling LBJ a bum steer\", a reference to Johnson's Texas roots, which conjured up images of cattle and cowboys in British minds.\nPart of the price paid by Wilson after talks with President Johnson in June 1967 for US assistance with the UK economy was his agreement to maintain a military presence East of Suez. In July 1967 Defence Secretary Denis Healey announced that Britain would abandon her mainland bases East of Suez by 1977, although airmobile forces would be retained which could if necessary be deployed in the region. Shortly afterwards, in January 1968, Wilson announced that the proposed timetable for this withdrawal was to be accelerated and that British forces were to be withdrawn from Singapore, Malaysia, and the Persian Gulf by the end of 1971.\nWilson was known for his strongly pro-Israel views. He was a particular friend of Israeli Premier Golda Meir, though her tenure largely coincided with Wilson's 1970\u20131974 hiatus. Another associate was West German Chancellor Willy Brandt; all three were members of the Socialist International.\nAfrica.\nThe British \"retreat from Empire\" had made headway by 1964 and was to continue during Wilson's administration. Southern Rhodesia was not granted independence, principally because Wilson refused to grant independence to the white minority government headed by Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith which was not willing to extend unqualified voting rights to the native African population. Smith's defiant response was a Unilateral Declaration of Independence, on 11 November 1965. Wilson's immediate recourse was to the United Nations, and in 1965, the Security Council imposed sanctions, which were to last until official independence in 1979. This involved British warships blockading the port of Beira to try to cause economic collapse in Rhodesia. Wilson was applauded by most nations for taking a firm stand on the issue (and none extended diplomatic recognition to the Smith r\u00e9gime). A number of nations did not join in with sanctions, undermining their efficiency. Certain sections of public opinion started to question their efficacy, and to demand the toppling of the r\u00e9gime by force. Wilson declined to intervene in Rhodesia with military force, believing the British population would not support such action against their \"kith and kin\". The two leaders met for discussions aboard British warships, in 1966 and in 1968. Smith subsequently attacked Wilson in his memoirs, accusing him of delaying tactics during negotiations and alleging duplicity; Wilson responded in kind, questioning Smith's good faith and suggesting that Smith had moved the goal-posts whenever a settlement appeared in sight. The matter was still unresolved at the time of Wilson's resignation in 1976. Wilson had a good relationship with Siaka Stevens of Sierra Leone; the two leaders attempted to work together to find a solution to the question of Biafra in Nigeria. But despite this, the British government was actively sending arms, munitions and other equipment to the Nigerian military junta, and consistently denied any wrongdoing by the government of Nigeria: Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe wrote that this may have cost him his position.\nElectoral defeat and resignation.\nBy 1969, the Labour Party was suffering serious electoral reverses, and by the turn of 1970 had lost a total of 16 seats in by-elections since the previous general election.\nBy 1970, the economy was showing signs of improvement, and by May that year, Labour had overtaken the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Wilson responded to this apparent recovery in his government's popularity by calling a general election, but, to the surprise of most observers, was defeated at the polls by the Conservatives under Heath. Most opinion polls had predicted a Labour win, with a poll six days before the election showing a 12.4% Labour lead. Writing in the aftermath of the election, \"The Times\" journalist George Clark wrote that the 1970 contest would be \"remembered as the occasion when the people of the United Kingdom hurled the findings of the opinion polls back into the faces of the pollsters and at the voting booths proved them wrong\u2014most of them badly wrong\". Heath and the Conservatives had attacked Wilson over the economy. Towards the end of the campaign, bad trade figures for May added weight to Heath's campaign and he claimed that a Labour victory would result in a further devaluation. Wilson considered Heath's claims \"irresponsible\" and \"damaging to the nation\". Ultimately, however, the election saw Labour's vote share fall to its lowest since 1935. Several prominent Labour figures lost their seats, notably George Brown who was still Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.\nReturn to opposition (1970\u20131974).\nFollowing the elections and Labour's subsequent defeat, Wilson survived as leader of the Labour Party in opposition. In August 1973, holidaying on the Isles of Scilly, he tried to board a motorboat from a dinghy and stepped into the sea. He was unable to get into the boat and was left in the cold water for more than half an hour, hanging on to the fenders of the motorboat. He was close to death before he was saved by Paul Wolff, the father of novelist Isabel Wolff. When word of the incident became public the following month, Wilson downplayed its severity; it was taken up by the press and resulted in some embarrassment. His press secretary, Joe Haines, tried to deflect some of the comment by blaming Wilson's dog Paddy for the problem.\nEarly in 1974, Wilson became the victim of a personation fraud. A Staffordshire property developer, Ronald Milhench, forged a letter purporting to be from the former Prime Minister. Milhench was involved in negotiations for a property deal; unable to provide finance, he met a journalist, claiming that Wilson was involved with the deal. Milhench further claimed he wanted to deal \"a body blow\" to Labour's election chances and that he could sell the letter for \u00a325000. In November 1974, Milhench was convicted of forgery, theft and firearms charges.\nEconomic conditions during the 1970s were becoming more difficult for Britain and many other western economies as a result of the Nixon shock and the 1973 oil crisis, and the Heath government in its turn was buffeted by economic adversity and industrial unrest (notably including confrontation with the coalminers which led to the Three-Day Week) towards the end of 1973, and on 7 February 1974 (with the crisis still ongoing) Heath called a snap election for 28 February.\nSecond premiership (1974\u20131976).\nLabour won more seats (though fewer votes) than the Conservative Party in the general election in February 1974, which resulted in a hung parliament. As Heath was unable to persuade the Liberals to form a coalition, Wilson returned to 10 Downing Street on 4 March 1974 as prime minister of a minority Labour Government. He gained a three-seat majority in another election later that year, on 10 October 1974.\n1975 European referendum.\nOne of the key issues addressed during his second period in office was the referendum on British membership of the European Community (EC) which took place in June 1975: Labour had pledged in its February 1974 manifesto to renegotiate the terms of British accession to the EC, and then to consult the public in a referendum on whether Britain should stay in on the new terms. Although the government recommended a vote in favour of continued membership, the cabinet was split on the issue, and Ministers were allowed to campaign on different sides of the question. The referendum resulted in a near two-to-one majority in favour of Britain remaining in the EC.\nDomestic social and economic affairs.\nThe Second Wilson Government made a major commitment to the expansion of the British welfare state, with increased spending on education, health, and housing rents. To pay for it, it imposed controls and raised taxes on the rich. Wilson's new chancellor Denis Healey partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top rate of tax from 90% to 75%, increasing it to 83% in his first budget, which came into law in April 1974. This applied to incomes over \u00a320,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023), and combined with a 15% surcharge on 'unearned' income (investments and dividends) could add up to a 98% marginal rate of personal income tax. In 1974, as many as 750,000 people were liable to pay the top rate of income tax.\nCircular 4/74 (1974) renewed pressure for moves towards comprehensive education (progress of which had stalled under the Heath ministry), while the industrial relations legislation passed under Edward Heath was repealed. The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 set up a Health and Safety Commission and a Health and Safety Executive; it gave a legal framework for health and safety at work. while the Child Benefits Act 1975 introduced an extra payment for single parents. In June 1975, the government issued the first series of National Savings Retirement Certificates.\nThe Social Security Act 1975 introduced a maternity allowance fund, while the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 set up an Equal Opportunities Commission and outlawed gender discrimination (both indirect and direct), with women given the right in principle to equal access to jobs and equal treatment at work with men. \nDespite its achievements in social policy, Wilson's government came under scrutiny in 1975 for the rise in the unemployment rate, with the total number of Britons out of work passing one million by that April.\nEconomic affairs.\nWilson's second government came into office at a troubled time for the British economy, due to a global recession and stagflation, caused in large part by the 1973 oil crisis and the preceding government's inflationary attempt to boost growth. In order to deal with inflation (which peaked at 26% in 1975) the government negotiated a 'social contract' with the Trades Union Congress to implement a voluntary incomes policy, in which pay rises were held down to limits set by the government. This policy operated with reasonable success for the next few years, and inflation fell to single figures by 1978. By 1976 the recession had ended and economic recovery began, by 1978/79 living standards recovered to the level they had been in 1973/74. The Labour governments of the 1970s did, however, manage to protect the living standards of many people from the worst effects of the recession and high inflation, with pensions increasing by 20% in real terms between 1974 and 1979, while measures such as rent and price controls and food and transport subsidies mitigated the adverse impact on the living standards of many more people.\nThe government's industrial policy was greatly influenced by the economist Stuart Holland and the Secretary of State for Industry Tony Benn. The centrepiece of the policy was the National Enterprise Board (NEB) which was established in 1975 and was intended to channel public investment into industry, in return for taking a holding of equity in private companies. The NEB was intended to extend public ownership of the economy as well as investing in the regeneration of industry, although it had some successes in that aim, in practice one of its main activities became that of propping up failing companies such as British Leyland. The government also continued its policy of encouraging regional development by increasing Regional Employment Premiums, which had first been established in 1967.\nNorthern Ireland.\nWilson's earlier government had witnessed the outbreak of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In response to a request from the Government of Northern Ireland, Wilson agreed to deploy the British Army in August 1969 to restore the peace.\nWhile out of office in late 1971, Wilson had formulated a 16-point, 15-year programme that was designed to pave the way for the unification of Ireland. The proposal was not adopted by the then Heath government.\nIn May 1974, when back in office as leader of a minority government, Wilson condemned the Unionist-controlled Ulster Workers' Council strike as a \"sectarian strike\". He refused to pressure a reluctant British Army to face down the Ulster loyalist paramilitaries who were intimidating utility workers. In a televised speech later, he referred to the loyalist strikers and their supporters as \"spongers\" who expected Britain to pay for their lifestyles. The strike was eventually successful in breaking the power-sharing Northern Ireland executive.\nIn May 1975, his government set up the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention as an attempt to deal with constitutional issues surrounding the status of Northern Ireland. The body, as established in the Northern Ireland Act 1974, was elected; the Act dissolved the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Constitutional Convention ultimately failed to achieve cross-community consensus on new constitutional arrangements, before it was permanently dissolved in 1976. The Northern Ireland Assembly was only re-established in 1982.\nOn 11 September 2008, BBC Radio 4's \"Document\" programme claimed to have unearthed a secret plan\u2014codenamed \"Doomsday\"\u2014which proposed to cut all of the United Kingdom's constitutional ties with Northern Ireland and transform the province into an independent dominion. \"Document\" went on to claim that the Doomsday plan was devised mainly by Wilson and was kept a closely guarded secret. The plan then allegedly lost momentum, due in part, it was claimed, to warnings made by the Foreign Secretary, James Callaghan, and the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Garret FitzGerald who admitted the 12,000-strong Irish Army would be unable to deal with a civil war. Later, Callaghan spoke and wrote despondently about the prospect for a British-derived solution to the Northern Ireland issue, supporting a similar plan to push Northern Ireland towards independent status.\nIn 1975, Wilson secretly offered Libya's dictator Muammar Gaddafi \u00a314 million to stop arming the Provisional Irish Republican Army, but Gaddafi demanded a far greater sum of money. This offer did not become publicly known until 2009.\nResignation.\nWhen Wilson entered office for the second time, he had privately admitted that he had lost his enthusiasm for the role, telling a close adviser in 1974 that \"I have been around this racetrack so often that I cannot generate any more enthusiasm for jumping any more hurdles.\" On 16 March 1976, Wilson resigned as prime minister, taking effect on 5 April. He claimed that he had always planned on resigning at the age of 60 and that he was physically and mentally exhausted. As early as the late 1960s he had been telling intimates, like his doctor Sir Joseph Stone (later Lord Stone of Hendon), that he did not intend to serve more than eight or nine years as prime minister.\nRoy Jenkins has suggested that Wilson may have been motivated partly by the distaste for politics felt by his loyal and long-suffering wife, Mary. His doctor had detected problems which would later be diagnosed as colon cancer, and Wilson had begun drinking brandy during the day to cope with stress. By 1976 he might already have been aware of the first stages of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which was to cause his formerly excellent memory and his powers of concentration to fail dramatically.\nWilson's Resignation Honours included many businessmen and celebrities, along with his political supporters. His choice of appointments caused lasting damage to his reputation, worsened by the suggestion that the first draft of the list had been written by his political secretary Marcia Williams on lavender notepaper (it became known as the \"Lavender List\"). Roy Jenkins noted that Wilson's retirement \"was disfigured by his, at best, eccentric resignation honours list, which gave peerages or knighthoods to some adventurous business gentlemen, several of whom were close neither to him nor to the Labour Party.\" Some of those whom Wilson honoured included Lord Kagan, the inventor of Gannex (Wilson's preferred raincoat), who was eventually imprisoned for fraud, and Sir Eric Miller, who later committed suicide while under police investigation for corruption.\nThe Labour Party held an election to replace Wilson as leader of the Party, and thus prime minister. Six candidates stood in the first ballot; in order of votes they were: Michael Foot, James Callaghan, Roy Jenkins, Tony Benn, Denis Healey and Anthony Crosland. In the third ballot, on 5 April, Callaghan defeated Foot in a parliamentary vote of 176 to 137, and served as prime minister until May 1979.\nAs Wilson wished to remain an MP after leaving office, he was not immediately given the peerage customarily offered to retired prime ministers, but instead was created a Knight Companion of the Garter. He fought one last election in 1979 in which he was returned as a backbench MP for Huyton. Following his departure from the House of Commons before the 1983 general election, after 38 years of service, he was granted a life peerage as Baron Wilson of Rievaulx, of \"Kirklees in the County of West Yorkshire\", after Rievaulx Abbey, in the north of his native Yorkshire; the Kirklees refers to his home address of Huddersfield, and is not part of his title.\nPost-premiership (1976\u20131995).\nRetirement.\nHe was appointed in 1976 to chair the Committee to Review the Functioning of Financial Institutions (the Wilson Committee) which reported in June 1980.\nShortly after resigning as prime minister, Wilson was signed by David Frost to host a series of interview/chat show programmes. The pilot episode proved to be a flop as Wilson appeared uncomfortable with the informality of the format. Wilson also hosted two editions of the BBC chat show \"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\". He famously floundered in the role, and in 2000, Channel 4 chose one of his appearances as one of the \"100 Moments of TV Hell\".\nA lifelong Gilbert and Sullivan fan, in 1975, Wilson joined the Board of Trustees of the D'Oyly Carte Trust at the invitation of Sir Hugh Wontner, who was then the Lord Mayor of London. At Christmas 1978, Wilson appeared on the \"Morecambe and Wise\" Christmas Special. Eric Morecambe's habit of appearing not to recognise the guest stars was repaid by Wilson, who referred to him throughout as 'Morry-camby' (the mispronunciation of Morecambe's name made by Ed Sullivan when the pair appeared on his famous American television show). Wilson appeared on the show again in 1980.\nWilson was not especially active in the House of Lords, although he did initiate a debate on unemployment in May 1984. His last speech was in a debate on marine pilotage in 1986, when he commented as an elder brother of Trinity House. In the same year he played himself as prime minister in an Anglia Television drama, \"Inside Story\".\nWilson suffered from advancing Alzheimer's-related dementia in his retirement years, making it difficult for him to earn an income capitalising on his experience as a former prime minister by writing books and giving speeches. According to his former press secretary Joe Haines: \"He never had much money of his own. Because of his mental condition he couldn't write articles or make speeches, and his income would have been his pension as an ex-prime minister,\" which Haines said was a \"comparatively small sum\" as Conservative and Liberal former prime ministers were usually aristocrats who had their own wealth or would benefit from wealthy benefactors and by being appointed to corporate boards, and thus did not need to rely on their parliamentary pensions to support themselves. One of Wilson's successors as Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, told \"The Guardian\": \"I heard stories that he was trying to make speeches for money but was unsuccessful because he had lost his fluency.\" Eventually, Wilson attempted to sell his personal papers to McMaster University in Canada for \u00a3212,500 in order to fund costs of his health care. This arrangement was considered unsuitable by the government and instead, it was arranged in 1991 that anonymous donors would provide funds so that the Bodleian Library at Oxford could buy Wilson's papers in order to keep them in the United Kingdom while also allowing the proceeds to set up a trust fund for Wilson and his wife.\nDeath.\nWilson continued regularly attending the House of Lords until just over a year before his death; the last sitting he attended was on 27 April 1994. He had a picture taken with other Labour Lords on 15 June 1994, just under a year before his death. He died of colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease on 23 May 1995, aged 79.\nMany in the House of Commons made tributes. Prime Minister John Major called him a \"formidable political opponent\" and ended his speech with the following words: \"What was Harold Wilson really like? I have formed my judgment. He was a complex man, certainly, a clever man, a sensitive man, a man who could be bruised and hurt and who never wore the armadillo skin of the fictional politician. He was a man of many achievements and, perhaps above all, a very human man who served his country well and honourably and who has earned, by that, a secure place in its history. In the ledger of life, his credit balance is very high. It is a privilege for me, as one, nominally, of his political opponents, to pay him this tribute and I do so unreservedly.\"\nWilson's memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 13 July 1995. It was attended by Charles, Prince of Wales, the former prime ministers Edward Heath, James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher, the incumbent prime minister John Major, and Tony Blair, then Leader of the Opposition and later prime minister. Wilson was buried at St Mary's Old Church, St Mary's, Isles of Scilly, on 6 June. His epitaph is \"\" (\"Time the Commander of Things\").\nPersonal life.\nOn New Year's Day 1940, in the chapel of Mansfield College, Oxford, he married Mary Baldwin, whom he remained married to until his death. Mary Wilson became a published poet, and outlived her husband by 23 years. She died on 6 June 2018 at the age of 102. They had two sons, Robin and Giles (named after Giles Alington); Robin became a professor of mathematics, and Giles became a teacher and later a train driver. In their twenties, his sons were under a kidnap threat from the IRA because of their father's prominence.\nIn April 2024 Joe Haines, who had served as Wilson's press secretary during his time as prime minister, revealed that Wilson had had an affair with Haines' deputy Janet Hewlett-Davies during his final two years in office. Hewlett-Davies died aged 85 in October 2023. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" programme, Wilson's former adviser Bernard Donoughue said the affair had provided \"a little sunshine at sunset\" for Wilson, who was becoming \"increasingly paranoid about the security services\", was dealing with political difficulties, and was possibly in the early stages of dementia.\nLegacy.\nPolitical style.\nWilson regarded himself as a \"man of the people\" and did much to promote this image, contrasting himself with the stereotypical aristocratic conservatives and other statesmen who had preceded him, as an example of social mobility. He largely retained his Yorkshire accent. Other features of this persona included his working man's Gannex raincoat, his pipe (the British Pipesmokers' Council voted him Pipe Smoker of the Year in 1965 and Pipeman of the Decade in 1976, though in private he preferred cigars), his love of simple cooking and fondness for the popular British relish HP Sauce, and his support for his home town's football team, Huddersfield Town. His first general election victory relied heavily on associating these down-to-earth attributes with a sense that the UK urgently needed to modernise after \"thirteen years of Tory mis-rule\".\nWilson exhibited his populist touch in June 1965 when he had the Beatles honoured with the award of MBE. The award was popular with young people and contributed to a sense that the prime minister was \"in touch\" with the younger generation. There were some protests by conservatives and elderly members of the military who were earlier recipients of the award, but such protesters were in the minority. Critics claimed that Wilson acted to solicit votes for the next general election (which took place less than a year later), but defenders noted that, since the minimum voting age at that time was 21, this was hardly likely to impact many of the Beatles' fans who at that time were predominantly teenagers. It cemented Wilson's image as a modernistic leader and linked him to the burgeoning pride in the 'New Britain' typified by the Beatles. The Beatles mentioned Wilson rather negatively, naming both him and his opponent Edward Heath in George Harrison's song \"Taxman\", the opener to 1966's \"Revolver\"\u2014recorded and released after the MBEs.\nIn 1967 Wilson had a different interaction with a musical ensemble. He sued the pop group the Move for libel after the band's manager Tony Secunda published a promotional postcard for the single \"Flowers in the Rain\", featuring a caricature depicting Wilson in bed with his female assistant, Marcia Williams. Gossip had hinted at an improper relationship, though these rumours were never substantiated. Wilson won the case, and all royalties from the song (composed by Move leader Roy Wood) were assigned in perpetuity to a charity of Wilson's choosing.\nWilson coined the term 'Selsdon Man' to refer to the free market policies of the Conservative leader Edward Heath, developed at a policy retreat held at the Selsdon Park Hotel in early 1970. This phrase, intended to evoke the 'primitive throwback' qualities of anthropological discoveries such as Piltdown Man and Swanscombe Man, was part of a British political tradition of referring to political trends by suffixing 'man'. Other memorable phrases attributed to Wilson include \"the white heat of the [technological] revolution\", and \"a week is a long time in politics\", meaning that political fortunes can change extremely rapidly. In his broadcast after the 1967 devaluation of the pound, Wilson said: \"This does not mean that the pound here in Britain\u2014in your pocket or purse\u2014is worth any less\" and the phrase \"the pound in your pocket\" subsequently took on a life of its own.\nReputation.\nDespite his successes, Wilson's reputation took a long time to recover from the low ebb reached after his second premiership. The reinvention of the Labour Party would take the better part of two decades at the hands of Neil Kinnock, John Smith and, electorally and most conclusively, Tony Blair. Disillusion with Britain's weak economic performance and troubled industrial relations, combined with campaigning by figures such as Sir Keith Joseph, had helped to make a radical market programme politically feasible for Margaret Thatcher (which was, in turn, to influence the subsequent Labour leadership, especially under Blair). An opinion poll in September 2011 found that Wilson came in third place when respondents were asked to name the best post-war Labour Party leader. He was beaten only by John Smith and Tony Blair.\nAccording to Glen O'Hara in 2006:\nMuch of the disillusionment with Harold Wilson as Labour's leader and prime minister was due to his perceived failure on the economic front. He pledged not to devalue sterling, but did exactly that in 1967; he promised to keep unemployment low, but had by 1970 accepted a higher rate of joblessness than the Conservatives had managed. Some of the elements in Labour's programme \u2013 the emphasis on steadier growth, for instance \u2013 were probably misguided. These problems and defeats have, however, obscured some of the real achievements of the period. Science and education spending grew very quickly; industrial investment rose; government was increasingly well informed and better advised about the performance of the economy. In an increasingly unstable and rapidly changing economic environment, this government's economic record is here shown to be, if not hugely impressive, then at least relatively creditable.\nPossible plots and conspiracy theories.\nIn 1963, Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn is said to have secretly claimed that Wilson was a KGB agent. The majority of intelligence officers did not believe that Golitsyn was credible in this and various other claims, but a significant number did (most prominently James Jesus Angleton, Deputy Director of Operations for Counterintelligence at the US Central Intelligence Agency) and factional strife broke out between the two groups. Former MI5 officer Peter Wright claimed in his memoirs, \"Spycatcher\", that 30 MI5 agents then collaborated in an attempt to undermine Wilson. He later retracted that claim, saying that there was only one man.\nIn March 1987, James Miller, a former agent, claimed that the Ulster Workers' Council strike of 1974 had been promoted by MI5 to help destabilise Wilson's government. In July 1987, Labour MP Ken Livingstone used his maiden speech to raise the 1975 allegations of a former Army Press officer in Northern Ireland, Colin Wallace, who also alleged a plot to destabilise Wilson. Chris Mullin MP, speaking on 23 November 1988, argued that sources other than Peter Wright supported claims of a long-standing attempt by MI5 to undermine Wilson's government.\nOn the BBC television programme \"The Plot Against Harold Wilson\", broadcast on 16 March 2006 on BBC Two, it was claimed there were threats of a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" against the Wilson government, which were corroborated by leading figures of the time on both the left and the right. Wilson told two BBC journalists, Barrie Penrose and Roger Courtiour, who recorded the meetings on a cassette tape recorder, that he feared he was being undermined by MI5. The first time was in the late 1960s after the Wilson government devalued the pound sterling but the threat faded after Conservative leader Edward Heath won the election of 1970. However, following the 1972 British miners' strike Heath decided to hold an election to renew his mandate to govern in February 1974 but lost narrowly to Wilson. There was again talk of a military coup, with rumours of Lord Mountbatten as head of an interim administration after Wilson had been deposed. In 1974, the British Army occupied Heathrow Airport on the grounds of training for possible IRA terrorist action at the airport. Although the military stated that this was a planned military exercise, 10 Downing Street was not informed in advance, and Wilson himself interpreted it as a show of strength, or warning, being made by the army.\nHistorian Christopher Andrew's official history of MI5, \"\", included a chapter (section E part 4) specifically alluding to a conspiracy instead of a plot against Wilson in the 1970s:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The characterisation of Harold Wilson as paranoid does not take account of the political context of the time, which was characterised by a paranoid political style generally which applied to both left and right (including MI5 itself). The suspicion of Wilson and others towards the unlawful activities of the security services and other right-wing figures resulted from concrete domestic and international developments discussed in more detail below. Andrew is correct to be sceptical, and there remains limited evidence of a 'plot' if a plot is defined as a tightly organised high-level conspiracy with a detailed plan. However, there is evidence of a conspiracy: a loosely connected series of unlawful manoeuvres against an elected government by a group of like-minded figures.\nThe Director-General of the Security Service assured Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and she told the House of Commons on 6 May 1987:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He has found no evidence of any truth in the allegations. He has given me his personal assurance that the stories are false. In particular, he has advised me that all the Security Service officers who have been interviewed have categorically denied that they were involved in, or were aware of, any activities or plans to undermine or discredit Lord Wilson and his Government when he was prime minister.\nIn 2009, \"The Defence of the Realm\" held that while MI5 kept a file on Wilson from 1945 when he became an MP\u2014because communist civil servants claimed that he had similar political sympathies\u2014there was no bugging of his home or office, and no conspiracy against him. In 2010 newspaper reports made detailed allegations that the Cabinet Office had required that the section on bugging of 10 Downing Street be omitted from the history for \"wider public interest reasons\". In 1963, on Macmillan's orders following the Profumo affair, MI5 bugged the Cabinet room, the waiting room, and the prime minister's study until the devices were removed in 1977 on Callaghan's orders. From the records, it is unclear if Wilson or Heath knew of the bugging, and no recorded conversations were retained by MI5 so possibly the bugs were never activated. Professor Andrew had previously recorded in the preface of the history that \"One significant excision as a result of these [Cabinet Office] requirements (in the chapter on The Wilson Plot) is, I believe, hard to justify\", giving credence to these new allegations.\nAs a result of his concerns about the danger to British parliamentary democracy, Wilson issued instructions that no agency should ever bug the telephones of any members of Parliament, a policy (still in place) which came to be known as the Wilson Doctrine.\nHonours.\nStatues and other tributes.\nA portrait of Harold Wilson, painted by the Scottish portrait artist Cowan Dobson, hangs today at University College, Oxford. Two statues of Harold Wilson stand in prominent places. The first, unveiled by the then prime minister Tony Blair in July 1999, stands outside Huddersfield railway station in St George's Square, Huddersfield. Costing \u00a370,000, the statue, designed by sculptor Ian Walters, is based on photographs taken in 1964 and depicts Wilson in walking pose at the start of his first term as prime minister. His widow, Mary requested that the eight-foot-tall monument not show Wilson holding his famous pipe as she feared it would make the representation a caricature.\nA block of high-rise flats in Huddersfield is named after Wilson.\nIn September 2006, Tony Blair unveiled a second bronze statue of Wilson in the latter's former constituency of Huyton, near Liverpool. The statue was created by Liverpool sculptor, Tom Murphy, and Blair paid tribute to Wilson's legacy at the unveiling, including the Open University. He added: \"He also brought in a whole new culture, a whole new country. He made the country very, very different\".\nAlso in 2006, a street on a new housing development in Tividale, West Midlands, was named Wilson Drive in honour of Wilson. Along with neighbouring new development Callaghan Drive (named after James Callaghan), it formed part of a large housing estate developed since the 1960s where all streets were named after former prime ministers or senior parliamentary figures.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Creative Commons has been credited with contributing to a re-thinking of the role of the \"commons\" in the Information Age. Their frameworks help individuals and groups distribute content more freely while still protecting themselves and their intellectual property rights legally.\nAccording to its founder Lawrence Lessig, Creative Commons' goal is to counter the dominant and increasingly restrictive permission culture that limits artistic creation to existing or powerful creators. Lessig maintains that modern culture is dominated by traditional content distributors in order to maintain and strengthen their monopolies on cultural products such as popular music and popular cinema, and that Creative Commons can provide alternatives to these restrictions.\nIn mid\u2011December 2020, Creative Commons released its strategy for the upcoming five years, which will focus more on three core of goals including advocacy, infrastructure innovation, and capacity building.\nCreative Commons network.\nUntil April 2018, Creative Commons had over 100 affiliates working in over 75 jurisdictions to support and promote CC activities around the world. In 2018 this affiliate network has been restructured into a network organisation. The network no longer relies on affiliate organisation but on individual membership organised in Chapter.\nHungary.\nCreative Commons Hungary was the affiliated network of Creative Commons in Hungary. The non-profit organization was founded in Budapest, Hungary in 2008 and was deleted from the official registry on February 6, 2017.\nJapan.\nCreative Commons Japan (CC Japan/CCJP) is the affiliated network of Creative Commons in Japan.\nIn 2003, the International University GLOCOM held a meeting for the CC Japan preparation.\nIn March 2004, CC Japan was launched by GLOCOM University. CC Japan is the world's second CC affiliated network (the first is in America).\nIn March 2006, CC Japan become the NPO and be in motion. In the same month, the CC founder Lawrence Lessig came to Japan to be one of the main holders of the open ceremony.\nWithin the same year, between May and June, different international events were held in Japan, including iSummit 06 and the first through third rounds of CCJP.\nIn February 2007, the ICC x ClipLife 15 second CM competition was held. In June, iSummit 07 was held. In July, the fourth CCJP was held. On July 25, Tokyo approved to become the NGO chairman of CCJP.\nIn 2008, Taipie ACIA joined CCJP. The main theme music which was chosen by CCJP was announced.\nIn 2009, INTO INFINITY shown in Tokyo and Sapporo. iPhone held the shows with Audio Visual Mixer for INTO INFINITY. (Apple joint research and development with CCJP)\nIn 2012, the 10th anniversary ceremony was held in Japan.\nIn 2015, Creative Commons 4.0 and Creative Commons 0 were released in Japanese language.\nSouth Korea.\nCreative Commons Korea (CC Korea) is the affiliated network of Creative Commons in South Korea. In March 2005, CC Korea was initiated by Jongsoo Yoon (in Korean: \uc724\uc885\uc218), former Presiding Judge of Incheon District Court, as a project of Korea Association for Infomedia Law (KAFIL). The major Korean portal sites, including Daum and Naver, have been participating in the use of Creative Commons licences. In January 2009, the Creative Commons Korea Association was consequently founded as a non-profit incorporated association. Since then, CC Korea has been actively promoting the liberal and open culture of creation as well as leading the diffusion of Creative Common in the country.\nBassel Khartabil.\nBassel Khartabil was a Palestinian Syrian open source software developer who served as a project lead and public affiliate for Creative Commons Syria. On March 15, 2012, he was detained by the Syrian government in Damascus at Adra Prison for no crime. On October 17, 2015, the Creative Commons Board of Directors passed a resolution calling for Bassel Khartabil's release. In 2017, Bassel's wife received confirmation that Bassel had been killed shortly after she lost contact with him in 2015.\nEvolution of CC licenses.\nAll current CC licenses (except the CC0 Public Domain Dedication tool) require attribution (attributing the authors of the original creative works), which can be inconvenient for works based on multiple other works. Critics feared that Creative Commons could erode the copyright system over time, or allow \"some of our most precious resources \u2013 the creativity of individuals \u2013 to be simply tossed into the commons to be exploited by whomever has spare time and a magic marker.\"\nCritics also worried that the lack of rewards for content producers would dissuade artists from publishing their work, and questioned whether Creative Commons would enable the commons that it aimed to create.\nCreative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig countered that copyright laws have not always offered the strong and seemingly indefinite protection that today's law provides. Rather, the duration of copyright used to be limited to much shorter terms of years, and some works never gained protection because they did not follow the now-abandoned compulsory format.\nThe maintainers of Debian, a Linux distribution known for its strict adherence to a particular definition of software freedom, rejected the Creative Commons Attribution License prior to version 3 as incompatible with the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) due to the license's anti-DRM provisions (which might, due to ambiguity, be covering more than DRM) and its requirement that downstream users remove an author's credit upon request from the author. Version 3.0 of the Creative Commons licenses addressed these concerns and, except for the non commercial and no-derivative variants, are considered to be compatible with the DFSG.\nKent Anderson, writing for The Scholarly Kitchen, a blog of the Society for Scholarly Publishing, criticized CC as being grounded on copyright principles and not really departing from it, and as being more complex and complicating than the latter \u2013 thus the public does not scrutinize CC, reflexively accepting it as one would a software license \u2013 while at the same time weakening the rights provided by copyright. Anderson ends up concluding that this is the point, and that \"Creative Commons receives significant funding from large information companies like Google, Nature Publishing Group, and RedHat\", and that Google money is especially linked to CC's history; for him, CC is \"an organization designed to promulgate the interests of technology companies and Silicon Valley generally\".\nCC license proliferation.\nAccording to Mako Hill, Creative Commons has established a range of licenses tailored to meet the different protection interests of authors of creative works, rather than forcing a single forced standard as a \"base level of freedom\" that all Creative Commons licenses must meet, and with which all licensors and users must comply. \"By failing to take any firm ethical position and draw any line in the sand, CC is a missed opportunity. ...CC has replaced what could have been a call for a world where 'essential rights are unreservable' with the relatively hollow call for 'some rights reserved.'\" He also argued that Creative Commons enables license proliferation, by providing multiple licenses that are incompatible.\nThe Creative Commons website states, \"Since each of the six CC licenses functions differently, resources placed under different licenses may not necessarily be combined with one another without violating the license terms.\" Works licensed under incompatible licenses may not be recombined in a derivative work without obtaining permission from the copyright owner.\nRichard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation stated in 2005 that he could not support Creative Commons as an activity because \"it adopted some additional licenses which do not give everyone that minimum freedom\", that freedom being \"the freedom to share, noncommercially, any published work\". Those licenses have since been retired by Creative Commons.\nLicense uses.\nCreative Commons is only a service provider for standardized license text, not a party in any agreement. No central database of Creative Commons works is controlling all licensed works and the responsibility of the Creative Commons system rests entirely with those using the licences. This situation is, however, not specific to Creative Commons. All copyright owners must individually defend their rights and no central database of copyrighted works or existing license agreements exists. The United States Copyright Office does keep a database of all works registered with it, but absence of registration does not imply absence of copyright, and CC licensed works can be registered on the same terms as unlicensed works or works licensed under any other licences.\nAlthough Creative Commons offers multiple licenses for different uses, some critics suggested that the licenses still do not address the differences among the media or among the various concerns that different authors have.\nLessig wrote that the point of Creative Commons is to provide a middle ground between two extreme views of copyright protection \u2013 one demanding that all rights be controlled, and the other arguing that none should be controlled. Creative Commons provides a third option that allows authors to pick and choose which rights they want to control and which they want to grant to others. The multitude of licenses reflects the multitude of rights that can be passed on to subsequent creators.\nNon-commercial use licenses.\nVarious commentators have reported confusion in understanding what \"noncommercial\" use means. Creative Commons issued a report in 2009, \"Defining noncommercial\", which presented research and various perspectives. The report claimed that noncommercial to many people means \"no exchange of money or any commerce\". Beyond that simple statement, many people disagree on whether noncommercial use permits publishing on websites supported with advertising, sharing noncommercial media through nonprofit publishing for a fee, and many other practices in contemporary media distribution. Creative Commons has not sought to resolve the confusion, in part because of high consumer demand for the noncommercial license as is with its ambiguity.\nPersonality rights.\nIn 2007, Virgin Mobile Australia launched a bus stop advertising campaign which promoted its mobile phone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to the photo-sharing site Flickr using a Creative Commons by Attribution license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation being required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL, leading to the photographer's Flickr page, on each of their ads. However, one picture depicted 15-year-old Alison Chang posing for a photo at her church's fund-raising carwash, with the superimposed, mocking slogan \"Dump Your Pen Friend\". Chang sued Virgin Mobile and Creative Commons. The photo was taken by Chang's church youth counsellor, Justin Ho-Wee Wong, who uploaded the image to Flickr under the Creative Commons license.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The case hinges on privacy, the right of people not to have their likeness used in an ad without permission. So, while Mr. Wong may have given away his rights as a photographer, he did not, and could not, give away Alison's rights. In the lawsuit, which Mr. Wong is also a party to, there is an argument that Virgin did not honor all the terms of the nonrestrictive license.\nOn November 27, 2007, Chang voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit against Creative Commons, focusing the lawsuit only against Virgin Mobile. The case was dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction and subsequently Virgin Mobile did not incur any damages towards the plaintiff.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Today, the Crow people have a federally recognized tribe, the Crow Tribe of Montana, with an Indian reservation, the Crow Indian Reservation, located in the south-central part of the state.\nCrow Native Americans are a Plains tribe, who speak the Crow language, part of the Missouri River Valley branch of Siouan languages. Of the 14,000 enrolled tribal citizens, an estimated 3,000 spoke the Crow language in 2007.\nIn historical times, the Crow lived in the Yellowstone River valley, which extends from present-day Wyoming, through Montana, and into North Dakota, where it joins the Missouri River. During the United States' expansion into the West, the Crow allied with the Americans against their neighbors and rivals, the Dakota, Lakota, and Cheyenne.\nSince the 19th century, Crow people have been concentrated on their reservation established south of Billings, Montana. Today, many also live in major Western cities. Their tribal headquarters are located at Crow Agency, Montana. The tribe operates the Little Big Horn College.\nName.\nThe autonym of the tribe, Aps\u00e1alooke or Absaroka, means \"children of the large-beaked bird\" and was given to them by the Hidatsa, a neighboring and related Siouan-speaking tribe. French interpreters translated the name as \"gens du corbeau\" (\"people of the crow\"), and they became known in English as the Crow. Other tribes also refer to the Aps\u00e1alooke as \"crow\" or \"raven\" in their own languages. The identity of the bird this name was meant to refer to originally is lost to time, but many Aps\u00e1alook\u00e9 people believe it references the mythical Thunderbird.\nHistory.\nInto the Northern Plains.\nThe Crow and related Hidatsa originated in the Ohio Country, south of Lake Erie. They migrated west through Illinois, Minnesota, and settled south of Lake Winnipeg in the 12th or 13th centuries. They grew crops and hunted bison in settled villages, until the mid-16th century when the Ojibwe and Cree drove them further west to the Upper Missouri River.\nLater the Crow moved to the Devil's Lake region of North Dakota before the Crow split from the Hidatsa and moved westward in the late 17th century. The Crow were largely pushed westward due to intrusion and influx of the Cheyenne and subsequently the Sioux, also known as the Lakota.\nTo acquire control of their new territory, the Crow fought against Shoshone bands, such as the Bikkaashe, or \"People of the Grass Lodges\", and drove them westward. The Crow allied with local Kiowa and Plains Apache bands. The Kiowa and Plains Apache bands later migrated southward, and the Crow remained dominant in their established area through the 18th and 19th centuries, the era of the fur trade.\nTheir historical territory stretched from what is now Yellowstone National Park and the headwaters of the Yellowstone River (E-chee-dick-karsh-ah-shay in Crow, translating to \"Elk River\") to the west, north to the Musselshell River, then northeast to the Yellowstone's mouth at the Missouri River, then southeast to the confluence of the Yellowstone and Powder rivers (Bilap Chashee, or \"Powder River\" or \"Ash River\"), south along the South Fork of the Powder River, confined in the SE by the Rattlesnake Mountains and westwards in the SW by the Wind River Range. Their tribal area included the river valleys of the Judith River (Buluhpa'ashe, or \"Plum River\"), Powder River, Tongue River, Big Horn River and Wind River as well as the Bighorn Mountains (Iisiaxp\u00faatachee Isawaxaaw\u00faua), Pryor Mountains (Baahpuuo Isawaxaaw\u00faua), Wolf Mountains (Cheetiish, or \"Wolf Teeth Mountains\") and Absaroka Range (also called Absalaga Mountains).\nOnce established in the Valley of the Yellowstone River and its tributaries on the Northern Plains in Montana and Wyoming, the Crow divided into four groups: the Mountain Crow, River Crow, Kicked in the Bellies, and Beaver Dries its Fur. Formerly semi-nomad hunters and farmers in the northeastern woodland, they adapted to the nomadic lifestyle of the Plains Indians as hunters and gatherers, and hunted bison. Before 1700, they were using dog travois for carrying goods.\nEnemies and allies.\nFrom about 1730, the Plains tribes rapidly adopted the horse, which allowed them to move out on to the Plains and hunt buffalo more effectively. However, the severe winters in the North kept their herds smaller than those of Plains tribes in the South. The Crow, Hidatsa, Eastern Shoshone, and Northern Shoshone soon became noted as horse breeders and dealers and developed relatively large horse herds. At the time, other eastern and northern tribes were also moving on to the Plains, in search of game for the fur trade, bison, and more horses. The Crow were subject to raids and horse thefts by horse-poor tribes, including the powerful Blackfoot, Gros Ventre, Assiniboine, Pawnee, and Ute. Later they had to face the Lakota and their allies, the Arapaho and Cheyenne, who also stole horses from their enemies. Their greatest enemies became the tribes of the Blackfoot Confederacy and the Lakota-Cheyenne-Arapaho alliance.\nIn the 18th century, pressured by the Saulteaux and Cree peoples (the Iron Confederacy), who had earlier and better access to guns through the fur trade, the Crow had migrated to this area from the Ohio Eastern Woodland area of present-day Ohio, settling south of Lake Winnipeg. From there, they were pushed to the west by the Cheyenne. Both the Crow and the Cheyenne were pushed farther west by the Lakota, who took over the territory west of the Missouri River, reaching past the Black Hills of South Dakota to the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming and Montana. The Cheyenne eventually became allies of the Lakota, as they sought to expel European Americans from the area. The Crow remained bitter enemies of both the Sioux and Cheyenne. They managed to retain a large reservation of more than 9300\u00a0km2 despite territorial losses, due in part to their cooperation with the federal government against their traditional enemies, the Sioux and Blackfoot. Many other tribes were forced onto much smaller reservations far from their traditional lands.\nThe Crow were generally friendly with the northern Plains tribes of the Flathead (although sometimes they had conflicts); Nez Perce, Kutenai, Shoshone, Kiowa, and Plains Apache. The powerful Iron Confederacy (Nehiyaw-Pwat), an alliance of northern plains Indian nations based around the fur trade, developed as enemies of the Crow. It was named after the dominating Plains Cree and Assiniboine peoples, and later included the Stoney, Saulteaux, and M\u00e9tis.\nHistorical subgroups.\nBy the early 19th century, the Aps\u00e1alooke fell into three independent groupings, who came together only for common defense:\nApsaalooke oral history describes a fourth group, the Bilapiluutche (\"Beaver Dries its Fur\"), who may have merged with the Kiowa in the second half of the 17th century.\nGradual displacement from tribal lands.\nWhen European Americans arrived in numbers, the Crows were resisting pressure from enemies who greatly outnumbered them. In the 1850s, a vision by Plenty Coups, then a boy, but who later became their greatest chief, was interpreted by tribal elders as meaning that the whites would become dominant over the entire country, and that the Crow, if they were to retain any of their land, would need to remain on good terms with the whites.\nBy 1851, the more numerous Lakota and Cheyenne were established just to the south and east of Crow territory in Montana. These enemy tribes coveted the hunting lands of the Crow and warred against them. By right of conquest, they took over the eastern hunting lands of the Crow, including the Powder and Tongue River valleys, and pushed the less numerous Crow to the west and northwest upriver on the Yellowstone. After about 1860, the Lakota Sioux claimed all the former Crow lands from the Black Hills of South Dakota to the Big Horn Mountains of Montana. They demanded that the Americans deal with them regarding any intrusion into these areas.\nThe Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1851 with the United States confirmed as Crow lands a large area centered on the Big Horn Mountains: the area ran from the Big Horn Basin on the west, to the Musselshell River on the north, and east to the Powder River; it included the Tongue River basin. But for two centuries the Cheyenne and many bands of Lakota Sioux had been steadily migrating westward across the plains, and were still pressing hard on the Crows.\nRed Cloud's War (1866\u20131868) was a challenge by the Lakota Sioux to the United States military presence on the Bozeman Trail, a route along the eastern edge of the Big Horn Mountains to the Montana gold fields. Red Cloud's War ended with victory for the Lakota. The Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 with the United States confirmed the Lakota control over all the high plains from the Black Hills of the Dakotas westward across the Powder River Basin to the crest of the Big Horn Mountains. Thereafter bands of Lakota Sioux led by Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Gall, and others, along with their Northern Cheyenne allies, hunted and raided throughout the length and breadth of eastern Montana and northeastern Wyoming, which had been for a time ancestral Crow territory.\nOn 25 June 1876, the Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne achieved a major victory over army forces under Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in the Crow Indian Reservation, but the Great Sioux War (1876\u20131877) ended in the defeat of the Sioux and their Cheyenne allies. Crow warriors enlisted with the U.S. Army for this war. The Sioux and allies were forced from eastern Montana and Wyoming: some bands fled to Canada, while others suffered forced removal to distant reservations, primarily in present-day Montana and Nebraska west of the Missouri River.\nIn 1918, the Crow organized a gathering to display their culture, and they invited members of other tribes. The Crow Fair is now celebrated yearly on the third weekend of August, with wide participation from other tribes.\nCrow Tribe history: a chronological record.\n1600\u20131699.\nA group of Crow went west after leaving the Hidatsa villages of earth lodges in the Knife River and Heart River area (present North Dakota) around 1675\u20131700. They selected a site for a single earth lodge on the lower Yellowstone River. Most families lived in tipis or other perishable kinds of homes at the new place. These Indians had left the Hidatsa villages and adjacent cornfields for good, but they had yet to become \"real\" buffalo hunting Crow following the herds on the open plains. Archaeologists know this \"proto-Crow\" site in present Montana as the Hagen site.\n1700\u20131799.\nSome time before 1765, the Crow held a Sun Dance, attended by a poor Arapaho. A Crow with power gave him a medicine doll, and he quickly earned status and owned horses as no one else. During the next Sun Dance, some Crow stole back the figure to keep it in the tribe. Eventually the Arapaho made a duplicate. Later in life, he married a Kiowa woman and brought the doll with him. The Kiowas use it during the Sun Dance and recognize it as one of the most powerful tribal medicines. They still credit the Crow tribe for the origin of their sacred Tai-may figure.\n1800\u20131824.\nThe enmity between the Crow and the Lakota was reasserted from the start of the 19th century. The Crow killed a minimum of thirty Lakota in 1800\u20131801 according to two Lakota winter counts. The next year, the Lakota and their Cheyenne allies killed all the men in a Crow camp with thirty tipis.\nIn the summer of 1805, a Crow camp traded at the Hidatsa villages on Knife River in present North Dakota. Chiefs Red Calf and Spotted Crow allowed the fur trader Francois-Antoine Larocque to join it on its way across the plains to the Yellowstone area. He traveled with it to a point west of the place where Billings, Montana, is today. The camp crossed Little Missouri River and Bighorn River on the way.\nThe next year, some Crow discovered a group of whites with horses on the Yellowstone River. By stealth, they captured the mounts before morning. The Lewis and Clark Expedition did not see the Crow.\nThe first trading post in Crow country was constructed in 1807, known as both Fort Raymond and Fort Lisa (1807\u2013ca. 1813). Like the succeeding forts, Fort Benton (ca. 1821\u20131824) and Fort Cass (1832\u20131838), it was built near the confluence of the Yellowstone and the Bighorn.\nThe Blood Blackfoot Bad Head's winter count tells about the early and persistent hostility between the Crow and the Blackfoot. In 1813, a force of Blood warriors set off for a raid on the Crow in the Bighorn area. Next year, Crows near Little Bighorn River killed Blackfoot Top Knot.\nA Crow camp neutralized thirty Cheyenne bent on capturing horses in 1819. The Cheyenne and warriors from a Lakota camp destroyed a whole Crow camp at Tongue River the following year. This was likely the most severe attack on a Crow camp in historic time.\n1825\u20131849.\nThe Crows put up 300 tipis near a Mandan village on the Missouri in 1825. The representatives of the US government waited for them. Mountain Crow chief Long Hair (Red Plume at Forehead) and fifteen other Crows signed the first treaty of friendship and trade between the Crows and the United States on 4 August. With the signing of the document, the Crows also recognized the supremacy of the United States, if they actually understood the word. River Crow chief Arapooish had left the treaty area in disgust. By help of the thunderbird he had to send a farewell shower down on the whites and the Mountain Crows.\nIn 1829, seven Crow warriors were neutralized by Blood Blackfoot Indians led by Spotted Bear, who captured a pipe-hatchet during the fight just west of Chinook, Montana.\nIn the summer of 1834, the Crow (maybe led by chief Arapooish) tried to shut down Fort McKenzie at the Missouri in Blackfeet country. The apparent motive was to stop the trading post's sale to their Indian enemies. Although later described as a month long siege of the fort, it lasted only two days. The opponents exchanged a few shots and the men in the fort fired a cannon, but no real harm came to anyone. The Crows left four days before the arrival of a Blackfeet band. The episode seems to be the worst armed conflict between the Crows and a group of whites until the Sword Bearer uprising in 1887.\nThe death of chief Arapooish was recorded on 17 September 1834. The news reached Fort Clark at the Mandan village Mitutanka. Manager F.A. Chardon wrote he \"was Killed by Black feet\".\nThe smallpox epidemic of 1837 spread along the Missouri and \"had little impact\" on the tribe according to one source. The River Crows grew in number, when a group of Hidatsas joined them permanently to escape the scourge sweeping through the Hidatsa villages.\nFort Van Buren was a short-lived trading post in existence from 1839 to 1842. It was built on the bank of the Yellowstone near the mouth of Tongue River.\nIn the summer of 1840, a Crow camp in the Bighorn valley greeted the Jesuit missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet.\nFrom 1842 to around 1852, the Crow traded in Fort Alexander opposite the mouth of the Rosebud.\nThe River Crows charged a moving Blackfeet camp near Judith Gap in 1845. Father Pierre-Jean De Smet mourned the destructive attack on the \"petite Robe\" band. The Blackfeet chief Small Robe had been mortally wounded and many killed. De Smet worked out the number of women and children taken captive to 160. By and by and with a fur trader as an intermediary, the Crows agreed to let 50 women return to their tribe.\n1850\u20131874.\nFort Sarpy (I) near Rosebud River carried out trade with the Crow after the closing of Fort Alexander. River Crow went some times to the bigger Fort Union at the confluence of the Yellowstone and the Missouri. Both the \"famous Absaroka amazon\" Woman Chief and River Crow chief Twines His Tail (Rotten Tail) visited the fort in 1851.\nIn 1851, the Crow, the Sioux, and six other Indian nations signed the Fort Laramie treaty along with the U.S. It should ensure peace forever between all nine partakers. Further, the treaty described the different tribal territories. The U.S. was allowed to construct roads and forts. A weak point in the treaty was the absence of rules to uphold the tribal borders.\nThe Crow and various bands of Sioux attacked each other again from the mid-1850s. Soon, the Sioux took no notice of the 1851 borders and expanded into Crow territory west of the Powder. The Crows engaged in \"\u2026 large-scale battles with invading Sioux \u2026\" near present-day Wyola, Montana. Around 1860, the western Powder area was lost.\nFrom 1857 to 1860, many Crow traded their surplus robes and skin at Fort Sarpy (II) near the mouth of the Bighorn River.\nDuring the mid-1860s, the Sioux resented the emigrant route Bozeman Trail through the Powder River bison habitat, although it mainly \"crossed land guaranteed to the Crows\". When the Army built forts to protect the trail, the Crow cooperated with the garrisons. On 21 December 1866, the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho defeated Captain William J. Fetterman and his men from Fort Phil Kearny. Evidently, the U.S. could not enforce respect for the treaty borders agreed upon 15 years before.\nThe River Crow north of the Yellowstone developed a friendship with their former Gros Ventre enemies in the 1860s. A joint large-scale attack on a large Blackfoot camp at the Cypress Hills in 1866 resulted in a chaotic withdrawal of the Gros Ventres and Crow. The Blackfoot pursued the warriors for hours and killed allegedly more than 300.\nIn 1868, a new Fort Laramie treaty between the Sioux and the U.S. turned 1851 Crow Powder River area into \"unceded Indian territory\" of the Sioux. \"The Government had in effect betrayed the Crows\u2026\". On 7 May, the same year, the Crow ceded vast ranges to the US due to pressure from white settlements north of Upper Yellowstone River and loss of eastern territories to the Sioux. They accepted a smaller reservation south of the Yellowstone.\nThe Sioux and their Indian allies, now formally at peace with the U.S., focused on intertribal wars at once. Raids against the Crows were \"frequent, both by the Northern Cheyennes and by the Arapahos, as well as the Sioux, and by parties made up from all three tribes\". Crow chief Plenty Coups recalled, \"The three worst enemies our people had were combined against us \u2026\".\nIn April 1870, the Sioux overpowered a barricaded war group of 30 Crow in the Big Dry area. The Crow were killed to either last or last but one man. Later, mourning Crow with \"their hair cut off, their fingers and faces cut\" brought the dead bodies back to camp. The drawing from the Sioux winter count of Lone Dog shows the Crow in the circle (the breastwork), while the Sioux close in on them. The many lines indicates flying bullets. The Sioux lost 14 warriors. Sioux chief Sitting Bull took part in this battle.\nIn the summer of 1870, some Sioux attacked a Crow reservation camp in the Bighorn/Little Bighorn area. The Crows reported Sioux Indians in the same area again in 1871. During the next years, this eastern part of the Crow reservation was taken over by the Sioux in search of buffalo. In August 1873, visiting Nez Perc\u00e9 and a Crow reservation camp at Pryor Creek further west faced a force of Sioux warriors in a long confrontation. Crow chief Blackfoot objected to this incursion and called for resolute U.S. military actions against the Indian trespassers. Due to Sioux attacks on both civilians and soldiers north of the Yellowstone in newly established U.S. territory (Battle of Pease Bottom, Battle of Honsinger Bluff), the Commissioner of Indian Affairs advocated the use of troops to force the Sioux back to South Dakota in his 1873 report. Nothing happened.\n1875\u20131899.\nTwo years later, in early July 1875, Crow chief Long Horse was killed in a suicidal attack on some Sioux, who previously had killed three soldiers from Camp Lewis on the upper Judith River (near Lewistown). George Bird Grinnell was a member of the exploring party in the Yellowstone National Park that year, and he saw the bringing in of the dead chief. A mule carried the body, which was wrapped in a green blanket. The chief was placed in a tipi \"not far from the Crow camp, reclining on his bed covered with robes, his face handsomely painted\". Crow woman Pretty Shield remembered the sadness in camp. \"We fasted, nearly starved in our sorrow for the loss of Long-Horse.\"\nExposed to Sioux attacks, the Crows sided with the U.S. during the Great Sioux War in 1876\u20131877. On 10 April 1876, 23 Crow enlisted as Army scouts. They enlisted against a traditional Indian enemy, \"... who were now in the old Crow country, menacing and often raiding the Crows in their reservation camps.\" Charles Varnum, leader of Custer's scouts, understood how valuable the enrolment of scouts from the local Indian tribe was. \"These Crows were in their own country and knew it thoroughly.\"\nNotable Crows like Medicine Crow and Plenty Coups participated in the Rosebud Battle along with more than 160 other Crows.\nThe Battle of the Little Bighorn stood on the Crow reservation. As most battles between the US and the Sioux in the 1860s and 1870s, \"It was a clash of two expanding empires, with the most dramatic battles occurring on lands only recently taken by the Sioux from other tribes.\" When the Crow camp with Pretty Shield learned about the defeat of George A. Custer, it cried for the assumed dead Crow scouts \"\u2026 and for Son-of-the-morning-star [Custer] and his blue soldiers \u2026\".\nOn 8 January 1877, three Crow participated in the last battle of the Great Sioux War in the Wolf Mountains.\nIn the spring of 1878, 700 Crow tipis were pitched at the confluence of Bighorn River and Yellowstone River. Together with Colonel Nelson A. Miles, an Army leader in the Great Sioux War, the large camp celebrated the victory over the Sioux.\nIn 1882, during the cattle boom, the US government responded to ranchers' demands for more land and pressured the Crow to cede the Western part of their reservation.\nCulture.\nSubsistence.\nThe main food source for the Crow was the American bison which was hunted in a variety of ways. Before the use of horses the bison were hunted on foot and required hunters to stalk close to the bison, often with a wolf-pelt disguise, then pursue the animals quickly on foot before killing them with arrows or lances. The horse allowed the Crow to hunt bison more easily as well as hunt more at one time. Riders would panic the herd into a stampede and shoot the targeted animals with arrows or bullets from horseback or lance them through the heart. In addition to bison the Crow also hunted bighorn sheep, mountain goats, deer, elk, bear, and other game. Buffalo meat was often roasted or boiled in a stew with prairie turnips. The rump, tongue, liver, heart, and kidneys all were considered delicacies. Dried bison meat was ground with fat and berries to make \"pemmican\". In addition to meat, wild edibles were gathered and eaten such as elderberries, wild turnip, and Saskatoon berries.\nThe Crow often hunted bison by utilizing buffalo jumps. \"Where Buffaloes are Driven Over Cliffs at Long Ridge\" was a favorite spot for meat procurement by the Crow Indians for over a century, from 1700 to around 1870 when modern weapons were introduced. The Crow used this place annually in the autumn, a place of multiple cliffs along a ridge that eventually sloped to the creek. Early in the morning the day of the jump a medicine man would stand on the edge of the upper cliff, facing up the ridge. He would take a pair of bison hindquarters and pointing the feet along the lines of stones he would sing his sacred songs and call upon the Great Spirit to make the operation a success. After this invocation the medicine man would give the two head drivers a pouch of incense. As the two head drivers and their helpers headed up the ridge and the long line of stones they would stop and burn incense on the ground repeating this process four times. The ritual was intended to make the animals come to the line where the incense was burned, then bolt back to the ridge area.\nHabitation and transportation.\nThe traditional Crow shelter is the tipi or skin lodge made with bison hides stretched over wooden poles. The Crow are historically known to construct some of the largest tipis. Tipi poles were harvested from the lodgepole pine which acquired its name from its use as support for tipis. Inside the tipi, mattresses and buffalo-hide seats were arranged around the edge, with a fireplace in the center. The smoke from the fire escaped through a hole or smoke-flap in the top of the tipi. At least one entrance hole with collapsible flap allowed entry into the tipi. Often hide paintings adorned the outside and inside of tipis with specific meanings attached to the images. Often specific tipi designs were unique to the individual owner, family, or society that resided in the tipi. Tipis are easily raised and collapsed and are lightweight, which is ideal for nomadic people like the Crow who move frequently and quickly. Once collapsed, the tipi poles are used to create a travois. Travois are a horse-pulled frame structure used by plains Indians to carry and pull belongings as well as small children. Many Crow families still own and use the tipi, especially when traveling. The annual Crow Fair has been described as the largest gathering of tipis in the world.\nThe most widely used form of transportation used by the Crow was the horse. Horses were acquired through raiding and trading with other Plains nations. People of the northern plains like the Crow mostly got their horses from people from the southern plains such as the Comanche and Kiowa who originally got their horses from the Spanish and southwestern Indians such as the various Pueblo people. The Crow had large horse herds which were among the largest owned by Plains Indians; in 1914 they had approximately thirty to forty thousand head. By 1921 the number of mounts had dwindled to just one thousand. Like other plains people the horse was central to the Crow economy and were a highly valuable trade item and were frequently stolen from other tribes to gain wealth and prestige as a warrior. The horse allowed the Crow to become powerful and skilled mounted warriors, being able to perform daring maneuvers during battle including hanging underneath a galloping horse and shooting arrows by holding onto its mane. They also had many dogs; one source counted five to six hundred. Dogs were used as guards and pack animals to carry belongings and pull travois. The introduction of horses into Crow society allowed them to pull heavier loads faster, greatly reducing the number of dogs used as pack animals.\nAttire.\nThe Crow wore clothing distinguished by gender. Women wore dresses made of deer and buffalo hide, decorated with elk teeth or shells. They covered their legs with leggings during winter and their feet with moccasins. Crow women wore their hair in two braids. Male clothing usually consisted of a shirt, trimmed leggings with a belt, a long breechcloth, and moccasins. Robes made from the furred hide of a bison were often worn in winter. Leggings were either made of animal hide which the Crow made for themselves or made of wool which were highly valued trade items made specifically for Indians in Europe. Their hair was worn long, in some cases reaching the ground. The Crow are famous for often wearing their hair in a pompadour which was often colored with white paint. Crow men were notable for wearing two hair pipes made from beads on both sides of their hair. Men often wore their hair in two braids wrapped in the fur of beavers or otters. Bear grease was used to give shine to hair. Stuffed birds were often worn in the hair of warriors and medicine men. Like other plains Indians the Crow wore feathers from eagles, crows, owls, and other birds in their hair for symbolic reasons. The Crow wore a variety of headdresses including the famous eagle feather headdress, bison scalp headdress with horns and beaded rim, and split horn headdress. The split horn headdress is made from a single bison horn split in half and polished into two nearly identical horns which were attached to a leather cap and decorated with feathers and beadwork. Traditional clothing worn by the Crow is still worn today with varying degrees of regularity.\nThe Crow are well known for their intercut beadwork. They adorned basically every aspect of their lives with these beads, giving special attention to ceremonial and ornamental items. Their clothing, horses, cradles, ornamental and ceremonial gear, in addition to leather cases of all shapes, sizes and uses were decorated in beadwork. They gave reverence to the animals they ate by using as much of it as they could. The leather for their clothing, robes and pouches were created from the skin of buffalo, deer and elk. The work was done by the tribeswomen, with some being considered experts and were often sought by the younger, less experienced women for design and symbolic advice. The Crow are an innovative people and are credited with developing their own style of stitch-work for adhering beads. This stitch, which is now called the overlay, is still also known as the \"Crow Stitch\". In their beadwork, geometric shapes were primarily used with triangles, diamonds and hour-glass structures being the most prevalent. A wide range of colors were utilized by the Crow, but blues and various shades of pink were the most dominantly used. To intensify or to draw out a certain color or shape, they would surround that figure or color in a white outline.\nThe colors chosen were not just merely used to be aesthetically pleasing, but rather had a deeper symbolic meaning. Pinks represented the various shades of the rising sun with yellow being the East the origin of the sun's arrival. Blues are symbolic of the sky; red represented the setting sun or the West; green symbolizing mother earth, black the slaying of an enemy and white representing clouds, rain or sleet. Although most colors had a common symbolism, each piece's symbolic significance was fairly subjective to its creator, especially when in reference to the individual shapes. One person's triangle might symbolize a teepee, a spear head to a different individual or a range of mountains to yet another. Regardless of the individual significance of each piece, the Crow People give reverence to the land and sky with the symbolic references found in the various colors and shapes found on their ornamental gear and even clothing.\nSome of the clothing that the Crow decorated with beads included robes, vests, pants, shirts, moccasins and various forms of celebratory and ceremonial gear. In addition to creating a connection with the land, from which they are a part, the various shapes and colors reflected one's standing and achievements. For example, if a warrior were to slay, wound or disarm an enemy, he would return with a blackened face. The black color would then be incorporated in the clothing of that man, most likely in his war attire. A beaded robe, which was often given to a bride to be, could take over a year to produce and was usually created by the bride's mother-in-law or another female relative-in-law. These robes were often characterized by a series of parallel horizontal lines, usually consisting of light blue. The lines represented the young women's new role as a wife and mother; also the new bride was encouraged to wear the robe at the next ceremonial gathering to symbolize her addition and welcoming to a new family. In modern times, the Crow still often decorate their clothing with intricate bead designs for powwow and everyday clothing.\nGender and kinship system.\nThe Crow had a matrilineal system. After marriage, the couple was matrilocal (the husband moved to the wife's mother's house upon marriage). Women hold a significant role within the tribe.\nCrow kinship is a system used to describe and define family members. Identified by Lewis Henry Morgan in his 1871 work \"Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family\", the Crow system is one of the six major types which he described: Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese.\nThe Crow historically had a status for male-bodied two-spirits, termed \"bat\u00e9\"/\"bad\u00e9\", such as Osh-Tisch.\n21st Century.\nGeography.\nThe Crow Indian Reservation in south-central Montana is a large reservation covering approximately of land area, the fifth-largest Indian reservation in the United States. The reservation is primarily in Big Horn and Yellowstone counties with ceded lands in Rosebud, Carbon, and Treasure counties. The Crow Indian Reservation's eastern border is the 107th meridian line, except along the border line of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.\nThe southern border is from the 107th meridian line west to the east bank of the Big Horn River. The line travels downstream to Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area and west to the Pryor Mountains and north-easterly to Billings. The northern border travels east and through Hardin, Montana, to the 107th meridian line. The 2000 census reported a total population of 6,894 on reservation lands. Its largest community is Crow Agency.\nGovernment.\nPrior to the 2001 Constitution, the Crow Tribe of Montana was governed by its 1948 constitution. The former constitution organized the tribe as a general council (tribal council). The general council held the executive, legislative, and judicial powers of the government and included all enrolled, adult members of the Crow Tribe, provided that women were 18 years or older and men were 21 or older. The general council was a direct democracy, comparable to that the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.\nThe Crow Tribe of Montana established a three-branch government at a 2001 council meeting with its 2001 constitution. The general council remains the governing body of the tribe; however, the powers were distributed to three separate branches within the government. In theory, the general council is still the governing body of the Crow Tribe, yet in reality the general council has not convened since the establishment of the 2001 constitution.\nThe executive branch has four officials. These officials are known as the chairperson, Vice-chairperson, Secretary, and Vice-Secretary. The Executive Branch officials are also the officials within the Crow Tribal General Council, which has not met since 15 July 2001.\nThe current administration of the Crow Tribe Executive Branch is as follows:\nThe Legislative Branch consists of three members from each district on the Crow Indian Reservation. The Crow Indian Reservation is divided into six districts known as The Valley of the Chiefs, Reno, Black Lodge, Mighty Few, Big Horn, and Pryor Districts. The Valley of the Chiefs District is the largest district by population.\nThe Judicial Branch consists of all courts established by the Crow Law and Order Code and in accordance with the 2001 Constitution. The Judicial Branch has jurisdiction over all matters defined in the Crow Law and Order Code. The Judicial Branch attempts to be a separate and distinct branch of government from the Legislative and Executive Branches of Crow Tribal Government. The Judicial Branch consists of an elected Chief Judge and two Associate Judges. The Crow Court of Appeals, similar to State Court of Appeals, receives all appeals from the lower courts. The Chief Judge of the Crow Tribe is Julie Yarlott.\nConstitution controversy.\nAccording to the 1948 Constitution, Resolution 63-01 (Please note: in a letter of communication from Phileo Nash, then Commissioner of Indian Affairs, to the B.I.A. Area Director, as stated in the letter and confirmed that 63-01 is an Ordinance in said letter) all constitutional amendments must be voted on by secret ballot or referendum vote. In 2001, major actions were taken by the former Chairperson Birdinground without complying with those requirements. The quarterly council meeting on 15 July 2001 passed all resolutions by voice vote, including the measure to repeal the current constitution and approve a new constitution.\nCritics contend the new constitution is contrary to the spirit of the Crow Tribe, as it provides authority for the US Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to approve Crow legislation and decisions. The Crow people have guarded their sovereignty and Treaty Rights. The alleged New Constitution was not voted on to add it to the agenda of the Tribal Council. The former constitution mandated that constitutional changes be conducted by referendum vote, using the secret ballot election method and criteria. In addition, a constitutional change can only be conducted in a specially called election, which was never approved by council action for the 2001 Constitution. The agenda was not voted on or accepted at the council.\nThe only vote taken at the council was whether to conduct the voting by voice vote or walking through the line. Critics say the chairman ignored and suppressed attempts to discuss the Constitution. This council and constitutional change was never ratified by any subsequent council action. The Tribal Secretary, who was removed from office by the Birdinground Administration, was the leader of the opposition. All activity occurred without his signature.\nWhen the opposition challenged, citing the violation of the Constitutional Process and the Right to Vote, the Birdinground Administration sought the approval of the United States Department of the Interior (USDOI), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The latter stated it could not interfere in an internal tribal affair The federal court also ruled that the constitutional change was an internal tribal matter.\nLeadership.\nThe seat of government and capital of the Crow Indian Reservation is Crow Agency, Montana.\nThe Crow Tribe historically elected a chairperson of tribal council biennially; however, in 2001, the term of office was extended to four years. The previous chairperson was Carl Venne. The chairperson serves as chief executive officer, speaker of the council, and majority leader of the Crow Tribal Council. The constitutional changes of 2001 created a three-branch government. The chairperson serves as the head of the executive branch, which includes the offices of vice-chairperson, secretary, vice-secretary, and the tribal offices and departments of the Crow Tribal Administration. Notable chairs include Clara Nomee, Edison Real Bird, and Robert \"Robie\" Yellowtail.\nOn 19 May 2008, Hartford and Mary Black Eagle of the Crow Tribe adopted U.S. Senator (later President) Barack Obama into the tribe on the date of the first visit of a U.S. presidential candidate to the nation. Crow representatives also took part in President Obama's inaugural parade. In 2009, Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow was one of 16 people awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nDuring the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, the Crow Tribe furloughed 316 employees and suspended programs providing health care, bus services and improvements to irrigation.\nIn 2020, the Tribal Chairman AJ Not Afraid Jr. endorsed President Donald Trump's reelection, along with endorsing Republicans Steve Daines for the Senate, Greg Gianforte for Governor and Matt Rosendale for the U.S. House.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With 43 Broadway musicals and over 900 songs to his credit, Rodgers was one of the best-known American composers of the 20th century, and his compositions had a significant influence on popular music.\nRodgers is known for his songwriting partnerships, first with lyricist Lorenz Hart and then with Oscar Hammerstein II. With Hart he wrote musicals throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including \"Pal Joey\", \"A Connecticut Yankee\", \"On Your Toes\" and \"Babes in Arms.\" With Hammerstein he wrote musicals through the 1940s and 1950s, such as \"Oklahoma!\", \"Flower Drum Song\", \"Carousel\", \"South Pacific\", \"The King and I\", and \"The Sound of Music\". His collaborations with Hammerstein, in particular, are celebrated for bringing the Broadway musical to a new maturity by telling stories that were focused on characters and drama rather than the earlier light-hearted entertainment of the genre.\nRodgers was the first person to win all four of the top American entertainment awards in theater, film, recording, and television\u00a0\u2013 an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony\u00a0\u2013 now known collectively as an EGOT. In addition, he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, making him the first ever to receive all five awards (later joined by Marvin Hamlisch). In 1978, Rodgers was in the inaugural group of Kennedy Center Honorees for lifetime achievement in the arts.\nEarly life.\nRodgers was born into a Jewish family in Queens, New York, the son of Dr. William Abrahams Rodgers, a prominent physician who had changed the family name from Rogazinsky, and his wife Mamie (n\u00e9e Levy). Rodgers began playing the piano at the age of six. He attended P.S. 166, Townsend Harris Hall and DeWitt Clinton High School. Rodgers spent his early teenage summers in Camp Wigwam (Waterford, Maine) where he composed some of his first songs.\nRodgers, Lorenz Hart, and later collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II all attended Columbia University. At Columbia, Rodgers joined the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. In 1921, Rodgers shifted his studies to the Institute of Musical Art (now the Juilliard School). Rodgers was influenced by composers such as Victor Herbert and Jerome Kern, as well as by the operettas his parents took him to see on Broadway when he was a child.\nCareer.\nRodgers and Hart.\nIn 1919, Richard met Lorenz Hart, thanks to Phillip Levitt, a friend of Richard's older brother. Rodgers and Hart struggled for years in the field of musical comedy, writing several amateur shows. They made their professional debut with the song \"Any Old Place With You\", featured in the 1919 Broadway musical comedy \"A Lonely Romeo\". Their first professional production was the 1920 \"Poor Little Ritz Girl\", which also had music by Sigmund Romberg. Their next professional show, \"The Melody Man\", did not premiere until 1924.\nWhen he was just out of college Rodgers worked as musical director for Lew Fields. Among the stars he accompanied were Nora Bayes and Fred Allen. Rodgers was considering quitting show business altogether to sell children's underwear, when he and Hart finally broke through in 1925. They wrote the songs for a benefit show presented by the prestigious Theatre Guild, called \"The Garrick Gaieties\", and the critics found the show fresh and delightful. Although it was meant to run only one day, the Guild knew they had a success and allowed it to re-open later. The show's biggest hit\u2014the song that Rodgers believed \"made\" Rodgers and Hart\u2014was \"Manhattan\". The two were now a Broadway songwriting force.\nThroughout the rest of the decade, the duo wrote several hit shows for both Broadway and London, including \"Dearest Enemy\" (1925), \"The Girl Friend\" (1926), \"Peggy-Ann\" (1926), \"A Connecticut Yankee\" (1927), and \"Present Arms\" (1928). Their 1920s shows produced standards such as \"Here in My Arms\", \"Mountain Greenery\", \"Blue Room\", \"My Heart Stood Still\" and \"You Took Advantage of Me\".\nWith the Depression in full swing during the first half of the 1930s, the team sought greener pastures in Hollywood. The hardworking Rodgers later regretted these relatively fallow years, but he and Hart did write some classic songs and film scores while out west, including \"Love Me Tonight\" (1932) (directed by Rouben Mamoulian, who would later direct Rodgers's \"Oklahoma!\" on Broadway), which introduced three standards: \"Lover\", \"Mimi\", and \"Isn't It Romantic?\". Rodgers also wrote a melody for which Hart wrote three consecutive lyrics which were either cut, not recorded or not a hit. The fourth lyric resulted in one of their most famous songs, \"Blue Moon\". Other film work includes the scores to \"The Phantom President\" (1932), starring George M. Cohan, \"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum\" (1933), starring Al Jolson, and, in a quick return after having left Hollywood, \"Mississippi\" (1935), starring Bing Crosby and W. C. Fields.\nIn 1935, they returned to Broadway and wrote an almost unbroken string of hit shows that ended shortly before Hart's death in 1943. Among the most notable are \"Jumbo\" (1935), \"On Your Toes\" (1936, which included the ballet \"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue\", choreographed by George Balanchine), \"Babes in Arms\" (1937), \"I Married an Angel\" (1938), \"The Boys from Syracuse\" (1938), \"Pal Joey\" (1940), and their last original work, \"By Jupiter\" (1942). Rodgers also contributed to the book on several of these shows.\nMany of the songs from these shows are still sung and remembered, including \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\", \"My Romance\", \"Little Girl Blue\", \"I'll Tell the Man in the Street\", \"There's a Small Hotel\", \"Where or When\", \"My Funny Valentine\", \"The Lady Is a Tramp\", \"Falling in Love with Love\", \"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\", and \"Wait till You See Her\".\nIn 1939, Rodgers wrote the ballet \"Ghost Town\" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, with choreography by Marc Platoff.\nRodgers and Hammerstein.\nRodgers' partnership with Hart began having problems because of the lyricist's unreliability and declining health from alcoholism. Rodgers began working with Oscar Hammerstein II, with whom he had previously written songs (before ever working with Lorenz Hart). Their first musical, the groundbreaking hit \"Oklahoma!\" (1943), is a notable example of a \"book musical\", a musical play in which the songs and dances are fully integrated into the plot. What was once a collection of songs, dances and comic turns held together by a tenuous plot became a fully integrated narrative. Even though \"Show Boat\" is considered to be the earliest example of a book musical, \"Oklahoma!\" epitomized the innovations for which \"Show Boat\" had laid the groundwork and is considered the first production in American history to be intentionally marketed as a fully integrated musical.\nIn 1943, Richard Rodgers became the ninth president of the Dramatists Guild of America. In November that year he and Hart mounted a revival of \"A Connecticut Yankee\"; Hart died from alcoholism and pneumonia just days after its opening.\nRodgers and Hammerstein went on to create four more hits that are among the most popular in musical history. Each was made into a successful film: \"Carousel\" (1945), \"South Pacific\" (1949, winner of the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for Drama), \"The King and I\" (1951), and \"The Sound of Music\" (1959). Other shows include the minor hit \"Flower Drum Song\" (1958), as well as relative failures \"Allegro\" (1947), \"Me and Juliet\" (1953), and \"Pipe Dream\" (1955). They also wrote the score to the film \"State Fair\" (1945) (which was remade in 1962 with Pat Boone) and a special TV musical of \"Cinderella\" (1957).\nTheir collaboration produced many well-known songs, including \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\", \"People Will Say We're in Love\", \"Oklahoma\" (which also became the state song of Oklahoma), \"It's A Grand Night For Singing\", \"If I Loved You\", \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", \"It Might as Well Be Spring\", \"Some Enchanted Evening\", \"Younger Than Springtime\", \"Bali Hai\", \"Getting to Know You\", \"My Favorite Things\", \"The Sound of Music\", \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\", \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\", \"Do-Re-Mi\", and \"Edelweiss\", Hammerstein's last song.\nMuch of Rodgers' work with both Hart and Hammerstein was orchestrated by Robert Russell Bennett. Rodgers composed twelve themes, which Bennett used in preparing the orchestra score for the 26-episode World War II television documentary \"Victory at Sea\" (1952\u201353). This NBC production pioneered the \"compilation documentary\"\u2014programming based on pre-existing footage\u2014and was eventually broadcast in dozens of countries. The melody of the popular song \"No Other Love\" was later taken from the \"Victory at Sea\" theme entitled \"Beneath the Southern Cross\". Rodgers won an Emmy for the music for the ABC documentary \"Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years\", scored by Eddie Sauter, Hershy Kay, and Robert Emmett Dolan. Rodgers composed the theme music, \"March of the Clowns\", for the 1963\u201364 television series \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", which ran for 30 episodes. He also contributed the main title theme for the 1963\u201364 historical anthology television series \"The Great Adventure\".\nIn 1950, Rodgers and Hammerstein received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\" Rodgers, Hammerstein, and Joshua Logan won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for \"South Pacific\". Rodgers and Hammerstein had won a special Pulitzer Prize in 1944 for \"Oklahoma!\".\nIn 1954, Rodgers conducted the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in excerpts from \"Victory at Sea\", \"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue\" and the \"Carousel Waltz\" for a special LP released by Columbia Records.\nRodgers and Hammerstein musicals earned a total of 37 Tony Awards, 15 Academy Awards, two Pulitzer Prizes, two Grammy Awards, and two Emmy Awards.\nAfter Hammerstein.\nRodgers composed five new musicals between Hammerstein's death in 1960 and his own in 1979. In chronological order, they are: \"No Strings\" (1962), \"Do I Hear a Waltz?\" (1965), \"Two by Two\" (1970), \"Rex\" (1976), and \"I Remember Mama\" (1979).\nRodgers wrote both words and music for his first new Broadway project \"No Strings\", which earned two Tony Awards and played 580 shows. The show was a minor hit and featured the song, \"The Sweetest Sounds\".\nRodgers also wrote both the words and music for two new songs used in the film version of \"The Sound of Music\". (Other songs in that film were from Rodgers and Hammerstein.)\nEach of his final Broadway musicals faced a declining level of success as Rodgers was overshadowed by up-and-coming composers and lyricists. This was evident by the steady drop in run times and critic reviews. \"Do I Hear a Waltz?\" ran 220 performances; \"Two by Two,\" 343 performances; \"Rex\" only 49 performances; and \"I Remember Mama,\" 108 performances.\nWhile Rodgers went on to work with lyricists: Stephen Sondheim (\"Do I Hear a Waltz?\"), who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hammerstein, Martin Charnin (\"Two by Two,\" \"I Remember Mama\") and Sheldon Harnick (\"Rex\"), he never found another permanent partner. These partnerships proved to be unsuccessful as a result of issues of collaboration. Sondheim's reluctance to participate in \"Do I Hear a Waltz?\" led to tension between the two. In addition, Charnin and Rodgers were met with opposing ideas when creating \"Two by Two\".\nNevertheless, his overall successful lifetime career did not go unrecognized. At its 1978 commencement ceremonies, Barnard College awarded Rodgers its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction.\nRodgers was an honoree at the first Kennedy Center Honors in 1978. At the 1979 Tony Awards ceremony\u2014six months before his death\u2014Rodgers was presented the Lawrence Langner Memorial Award for Distinguished Lifetime Achievement in the American Theatre.\nOne of Rodger's final works was a revival of \"Fly With Me\" for the 1980 Varsity Show, to which he added several new songs. He died less than four months before its premiere in April 1980.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1930, Rodgers married Dorothy Belle Feiner (1909\u201392). Their daughter, Mary (1931\u20132014), was the composer of \"Once Upon a Mattress\" and an author of children's books. The Rodgers later lost a daughter at birth. Another daughter, Linda (1935\u20132015), also had a brief career as a songwriter. Mary's son and Richard Rodgers's grandson, Adam Guettel (b. 1964), also a musical theater composer, won Tony Awards for Best Score and Best Orchestrations for \"The Light in the Piazza\" in 2005. Peter Melnick (b. 1958), Linda Rodgers's son, is the composer of \"Adrift In Macao,\" which debuted at the Philadelphia Theatre Company in 2005 and was produced Off-Broadway in 2007. Mary Rodgers' book \"Shy: The Alarmingly Outspoken Memoirs of Mary Rodgers\" was published posthumously in 2022, and included her frank revelations and assessments of her father, family and herself.\nRodgers was an atheist. He was prone to depression and alcohol abuse and was at one time hospitalized.\nRodgers was portrayed by Tom Drake in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film \"Words and Music\", a semi-fictionalized depiction of the partnership of Rodgers and Hart. In Richard Linklater's 2025 film \"Blue Moon\", he is played by Andrew Scott, who won the Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance at the 75th Berlin International Film Festival.\nDeath.\nRodgers died in 1979, aged 77, after surviving cancer of the jaw, a heart attack, and a laryngectomy. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.\nLegacy.\nIn 1990, the 46th Street Theatre was renamed the Richard Rodgers Theatre in his memory. In 1999, Rodgers and Hart were each commemorated on United States postage stamps. In 2002, the centennial year of Rodgers' birth was celebrated worldwide with books, retrospectives, performances, new recordings of his music, and a Broadway revival of \"Oklahoma!\". The BBC Proms that year devoted an entire evening to Rodgers' music, including a concert performance of \"Oklahoma!\" The Boston Pops Orchestra released a new CD that year in tribute to Rodgers, entitled \"My Favorite Things: A Richard Rodgers Celebration\".\nAlec Wilder wrote the following about Rodgers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Of all the writers whose songs are considered and examined in this book, those of Rodgers show the highest degree of consistent excellence, inventiveness, and sophistication ... [A]fter spending weeks playing his songs, I am more than impressed and respectful: I am astonished.\nRodgers is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.\nAlong with the Academy of Arts and Letters, Rodgers also started and endowed an award for non-established musical theater composers to produce new productions either by way of full productions or staged readings. It is the only award for which the Academy of Arts and Letters accepts applications and is presented every year. Below are the previous winners of the award:\nRelationship with performers.\nRosemary Clooney recorded a version of \"Falling in Love with Love\" by Rodgers, using a swing style. After the recording session Richard Rodgers told her pointedly that it should be sung as a waltz. After Doris Day recorded \"I Have Dreamed\" in 1961, he wrote to her and her arranger, Jim Harbert, that theirs was the most beautiful rendition of his song he had ever heard.\nAfter Peggy Lee recorded her version of \"Lover\", a Rodgers song, with a dramatically different arrangement from that originally conceived by him, Rodgers said, \"I don't know why Peggy picked on me, she could have fucked up Silent Night\". Mary Martin said that Richard Rodgers composed songs for her for \"South Pacific\", knowing she had a small vocal range, and the songs generally made her look her best.

They are the largest of three Blackfeet-speaking groups that make up the Blackfeet Confederacy; the Siksika and Kainai are the others. The Piegan dominated much of the northern Great Plains during the nineteenth century.\nAfter their homelands were divided by the nations of Canada and the United States of America making boundaries between them, the Piegan people were forced to sign treaties with one of those two countries, settle in reservations on one side or the other of the border, and be enrolled in one of two government-like bodies sanctioned by North American nation-states. These two successor groups are the Blackfeet Nation, a federally recognized tribe in northwestern Montana, U.S., and the Piikani Nation, a recognized band government in Alberta, Canada.\nToday many Piegan live with the Blackfeet Nation with tribal headquarters in Browning, Montana. There were 32,234 Blackfeet recorded in the 1990 United States census. In 2010 the US Census reported 105,304 persons who identified as Blackfeet (\"alone\" or \"in combination\" with one or more races and/or tribes.)\nTerminology.\nThe \"Piegan\" (also known as the Pikuni, Piikuni, Piikani, and Piik\u00e1ni) are one of the three original tribes of the Blackfeet Confederacy (a \"tribe\" here refers to an ethnic or cultural group with a shared name and identity). The Piegan are closely related to the Kainai Nation (also known as the \"Blood Tribe\"), and the Siksika Nation (also called the \"Blackfeet Nation\"); together they are sometimes collectively referred to as \"the Blackfoot\" or \"the Blackfoot Confederacy\". Ethnographic literature most commonly uses \"Blackfeet people\", and Canadian Blackfeet people use the singular Blackfeet.\nThe tribal governments and the US government use the term \"Blackfeet\", as in Blackfeet Nation, as used on their official tribe website. The term \"Siksik\u00e1\", derived from \"Siksik\u00e1\u00edkoan\" (a Blackfeet person), may also be used as self-identification. In English, an individual may say, \"I am Blackfeet\" or \"I am a member of the Blackfeet tribe.\"\nTraditionally, Plains peoples were divided into \"bands\": groups of families who migrated together for hunting and defence. The bands of the Piegan, as given by Grinnell, are: Ahahpitape, Ahkaiyikokakiniks, Kiyis, Sikutsipmaiks, Sikopoksimaiks, Tsiniksistsoyiks, Kutaiimiks, Ipoksimaiks, Silkokitsimiks, Nitawyiks, Apikaiviks, Miahwahpitsiks, Nitakoskitsipupiks, Nitikskiks, Inuksiks, Miawkinaiyiks, Esksinaitupiks, Inuksikahkopwaiks, Kahmitaiks, Kutaisotsiman, Nitotsiksisstaniks, Motwainaiks, Mokumiks, and Motahtosiks. Hayden gives also Susksoyiks.\nRelations and history.\nBefore 1870s.\nIn 2014, researchers reported on their sequencing of the DNA of a 12,500+-year-old infant skeleton in west-central Montana, found in close association with several Clovis culture artifacts. It showed strong affinities with all existing Native American populations.\nThere is preliminary evidence of human habitation in north central Montana that may date as far back as 5000 years. There was evidence that the people had made substantial use of buffalo jumps from as early as AD 300.\nThe Piegan people may be more recent arrivals in the area, as there is strong evidence that, beginning about 1730, their Algonquian-speaking ancestors migrated southwest from what today is Saskatchewan. Before that, they may have lived further east, as many Algonquian-speaking peoples have historically lived along the Atlantic Coast, and others around the Great Lakes.\nLinguistic studies of the Blackfoot language in comparison to others in the Algonquian-language family indicate that the Blackfoot had long lived in an area west of the Great Lakes. Like others in this language family, the Blackfoot language is agglutinative.\nThe people practiced some agriculture and were partly nomadic. They moved westward after they adopted use of horses and guns, which gave them a larger range for bison hunting. They became part of the Plains Indians cultures in the early 19th century. According to tribal oral histories, humans lived near the Rocky Mountain Front for thousands of years before European contact. The Blackfoot creation story is set near Glacier National Park in an area now known as the Badger-Two Medicine.\nThe introduction of the horse is placed at about 1730, when raids by the Shoshone prompted the Piegan to obtain horses from the Kutenai and other Interior Salish peoples, as well as the Nez Perce. Early accounts of contact with European-descended people date to the late eighteenth century. The fur trader James Gaddy and the Hudson's Bay Company explorer David Thompson, the first Whites recorded as seeing Bow River, camped with a group of Piegan during the 1787\u20131788 winter.\nIn 1858 the Piegan in the United States were estimated to number 3,700. Three years later, Hayden estimated the population at 2,520. The population was at times dramatically lower when the Blackfeet people suffered declines due to infectious disease epidemics. They had no natural immunity to Eurasian diseases, and the 1837 smallpox epidemic on the Plains killed 6,000 Blackfeet, as well as thousands more in other tribes. The Blackfeet also suffered from starvation because of disruption of food supplies and war. When the last buffalo hunt failed in 1882, that year became known as the starvation year. In 1900, there were an estimated 20,000 Blackfoot. In 1906 there were 2,072 under the Blackfeet Agency in Montana, and 493 under the Piegan band in Alberta, Canada. In the early 21st century, there are more than 35,000. In the US 2010 census, 105,304 people identified as Piegan Blackfeet, 27,279 of them full-blooded, the remainder self-identified as being of more than one race or, in some cases, with ancestry from more than one tribe, but they primarily identified as Blackfeet.\nThe Blackfeet had controlled large portions of Alberta and Montana. Today the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana is the size of Delaware, and the three Blackfoot reserves in Alberta have a much smaller area.\nThe Blackfeet hold belief \"in a sacred force that permeates all things, represented symbolically by the sun whose light sustains all things\".\nThe Blackfeet have \"manly-hearted women\". These were recorded as acting in many of the social roles of men. This includes a willingness to sing alone, usually considered \"immodest\", and using a men's singing style.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Jansenists believed that God\u2019s grace was the only way to salvation and that human free will had no role. Jansenists provoked lively debates, particularly in France, where five propositions, including the doctrines of limited atonement and irresistible grace, were extracted from the work and declared heretical by theologians hostile to Jansen.\nIn 1653, Pope Innocent X condemned five ideas from Jansenism in the apostolic constitution \"Cum occasione\". Although Jansenists had some protection under Clement XI, they later became linked to political opposition to the monarchy. This made them a target of King Louis XIV and Clement XI, who took strong actions against them. In 1708, the Abbey of Port-Royal, a center of Jansenist thought, was closed. In 1713, Clement XI issued the bull \"Unigenitus\", which further condemned Jansenist teachings.\nIn the 18th century, Jansenists joined forces with Enlightenment thinkers in opposing the Jesuits, and they also played a role in persuading Louis XV to launch the suppression of the Jesuits. Many priests who supported the Civil Constitution of the Clergy during the French Revolution were influenced by Jansenism. However, Jansenism declined in the 19th century. The First Vatican Council's decision to declare papal infallibility ended the main debates that had supported Jansenism, leading to its disappearance.\nDefinition.\n\"A historical enigma\" according to certain historians, \"an adaptation to changing circumstances\" according to others, Jansenism had an evolution parallel to that of the Catholic Church until the 19th century, without any incontestable unity to be found in it.\nThe term 'Jansenism' was rejected by those called 'Jansenists', who throughout history consistently proclaimed their unity with the Catholic Church. Abbot Victor Carri\u00e8re, precursor of contemporary studies of Jansenism, says the following.There is perhaps no question more complicated than that of Jansenism. From the beginning, many of those who were rightly considered to be its legitimate representatives asserted that it does not exist [...]. Moreover, in order to escape the condemnations of the Church, to disarm certain attackers and win new adherents, it has, depending on the circumstances, attenuated or even modified its fundamental theses. Thus, despite the countless works devoted to it, the history of Jansenism in its entirety still remains to be written today, since the spirit of polemic has prevailed for two centuries.Jansenism was first of all a defence of Augustinian theology in a debate initiated by the Protestant Reformation and the Council of Trent,10 then a concrete implementation of this Augustinianism. The struggle against ultramontanism and papal authority gave it a Gallican character, which became an essential component of the movement. In the absolutist France of the 17th and 18th centuries, the fear of a transition from religious opposition to a general opposition justified monarchical repression of Jansenism, and consequently, transformed the movement by giving it a political aspect marked by resistance to power and a defence of the \"parlements\". In the 18th century, a diversity of 'Jansenisms' became more evident. In France, the participation of secular society in the movement revealed a popular and miraculous component involving figurism and the phenomenon of the \"convulsionnaires\". In northern Italy, the influence of the Austrian Enlightenment brought Jansenism closer to modernity. However in the 19th century, Jansenism was primarily a defence of the past and a struggle against modern developments in the Catholic Church.\nAugustin Gazier, historian of Jansenism and convinced Port-Royalist, attempts a minimal definition of the movement, removing the particularities to attribute a few common traits to all Jansenists: the subjection of one's whole life to a demanding form of Christianity, which gave a particular view of dogmatic theology, religious history and the Christian world. They harshly criticised developments in the church, but at the same time maintained an unshakeable loyalty to it.chapter 29\nTaking a broader view, the estimation of Marie-Jos\u00e9 Michel is that the Jansenists occupied an empty space between the ultramontane project of [Rome and the construction of Bourbon absolutism.French Jansenism is a creation of \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" society [...]. Developed from an Augustinian background very firmly anchored in France, it unfolds in parallel with the two great projects of French absolutism and the Catholic reformation [the Counter-Reformation]. Its development by part of the French religious and secular elites gives it an immediate audience never reached by the other two systems. It is thus rooted in French mentalities, and it truly survived as long as its two enemies, that is to say until the French Revolution for one, and until the First Vatican Council for the other.453Therefore Jansenism cannot be wholly encapsulated as a fixed theological doctrine defended by easily identifiable supporters claiming a system of thought, but rather, it represented the variable and diverse developments of part of French and European Catholicism in the early modern period.\nThe heresy of 'Jansenism', as stated by subsequent Roman Catholic doctrine, lies in the denial of the role of free will in the acceptance and use of grace. Jansenism asserts that God's role in the infusion of grace cannot be resisted and does not require human assent. The \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" states the Catholic position that \"God's free initiative demands man's free response\", that is, humans are said to freely assent or refuse God's gift of grace.\nOrigins.\nThe question of grace in the post-Tridentine period.\nJansenism originated from a theological school of thought within the framework of the Counter-Reformation, and appeared in the years following the Council of Trent, but drew from debates older than the council. Although Jansenism takes its name from Cornelius Jansen, it is attached to a long tradition of Augustinian thought.\nMost of the debates contributing to Jansenism concern the relationship between divine grace (which God grants to man) and human freedom in the process of salvation. In the 5th century, the North African bishop Augustine of Hippo opposed the British monk Pelagius who maintained that man has, within himself, the strength to will the good and to practice virtue, and thus to carry out salvation; a position that reduces the importance of divine grace. Augustine rejected this and declared that God alone decides to whom he grants or withholds grace, which causes man to be saved. The good or evil actions of man (and thus, his will and his virtue) do not affect this process, since man's free will was lost as a result of the original sin of Adam. God acts upon man through efficacious grace, in such a way that he infallibly regenerates him, without destroying his will.8 Man thus receives an irresistible and dominant desire for the good, which is infused into him by the action of efficacious grace.\nMedieval theology, dominated by Augustinian thought, left little room for human freedom on the subject of grace. Thomas Aquinas, however, attempted to organise a system of thought around Augustinianism in order to reconcile grace and human freedom. He both affirmed the action of the divine in each action of man, but also the freedom of man.8 The Scholastics of the 14th and 15th centuries moved away from Augustinianism towards a more optimistic view of human nature.8\nThe Reformation broke with Scholasticism,8 with Martin Luther and John Calvin both taking Augustine as a reference, but also representing radical views. For some Augustinians, it was only necessary to affirm the omnipotence of God against human freedom (which Pelagianism overly exalted), whereas Luther and Calvin saw grace (freely granted or withheld by God) as causing man to be saved. Man's free will was therefore totally denied.10\nTo counter the Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church in 1547 reaffirmed in the sixth session of the Council of Trent the place of free will, without pronouncing on its relationship with grace.9 Afterwards, the Roman Catholic position was not entirely unified, with the Jesuit priest Diego Laynez defending a position that his detractors described as Pelagian.9 Indeed, the Jesuits restarted the debate, fearing that excessive Augustinianism would weaken the role of the Church in salvation and compromise the rejection of Protestantism.9 In the wake of Renaissance humanism, certain Roman Catholics had a less pessimistic vision of man and sought to establish his place in the process of salvation by relying on Thomistic theology, which appeared to be a reasonable compromise between grace and free will.108 It is in this context that Aquinas was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church in 1567.\nNevertheless, theological conflict increased from 1567, and in Leuven, the theologian Michel de Bay (Baius) was condemned by Pope Pius V for his denial of the reality of free will. In response to Baius, the Spanish Jesuit Luis de Molina, then teaching at the University of \u00c9vora, defended the existence of 'sufficient' grace, which provides man with the means of salvation, but only enters into him by the assent of his free will. This thesis was violently opposed by the Augustinians, which resulted in the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith banning any publications on the problem of grace in 1611.15\nThe controversy was then concentrated in Leuven, where the Augustinian (Old) University of Leuven opposed the Jesuits.11 In 1628, Cornelius Jansen, then a professor at the university, undertook the creation of a theological work aimed at resolving the problem of grace by synthesising Augustine's thought on the matter. This work, a manuscript of nearly 1,300 pages with the title \"Augustinus\", was almost completed when Jansen died suddenly in an epidemic in 1638.31 On his deathbed, he committed a manuscript to his chaplain, ordering him to consult with Libert Froidmont, a theology professor at Leuven, and Henricus Calenus, canon at the metropolitan church, and to publish the manuscript if they agreed it should be published, adding, \"If, however, the Holy See wishes any change, I am an obedient son, and I submit to that Church in which I have lived to my dying hour. This is my last wish.\" Jansen affirmed in \"Augustinus\" that since the Fall of man, the human will is capable only of evil without divine help. Only efficacious grace can make him live according to the Spirit rather than the flesh, that is to say, according to the will of God rather than the will of man. This grace is irresistible and not granted to all men. Here Jansen agreed with Calvin's theory of predestination. The manuscript was published in 1640, expounding Augustine's system and forming the basis for the subsequent Jansenist controversy. The book consisted of three volumes:\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, Jansen had established a fruitful collaboration with one of his classmates at the University of Leuven, the Baianist Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, later the abbot of Saint-Cyran-en-Brenne. Vergier was Jansen's patron for several years and, following the completion of their theological studies, in 1606 obtained for Jansen a position as a tutor in Paris. Two years later, he got Jansen a position teaching at the bishop's college in Vergier's hometown of Bayonne. The two studied the Church Fathers together in Bayonne, with a special focus on the thought of Augustine, until they both left Bayonne in 1617. The question of grace was not central to their works at that time.20 Jansen returned to the University of Leuven, where he completed his doctorate in 1619 and was named professor of exegesis. Jansen and Vergier continued to correspond about Augustine, especially concerning his teachings on grace. Upon the recommendation of King Philip IV of Spain, Jansen was consecrated as Bishop of Ypres in 1636. It was only after the publication of \"Augustinus\" in 1638 that Vergier became the chief proponent of Jansen's theses, initially more out of loyalty to his late friend than out of personal conviction.\nA form of French Augustinianism\u2014Vergier and the Arnaulds.\nUntil then, grace was not frequently debated among French Roman Catholics; the topic was overshadowed by the devastating French Wars of Religion. The Jesuits were also banished from the kingdom between 1595 and 1603, so the Augustinian doctrine had no real opponents.\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, the principal religious movement was the French school of spirituality, mainly represented by the Oratory of Jesus founded in 1611 by Cardinal Pierre de B\u00e9rulle, a close friend of Vergier. The movement sought to put into practice a certain form of Augustinianism without focusing on the question of grace as the Jansenists would later do. Its emphasis was to bring souls to a state of humility before God through the adoration of Christ as Saviour.21 Although B\u00e9rulle interfered little in the debates on grace, the Oratory and the Jesuits still came into conflict, with Vergier taking part by publishing writings against the 'Molinists'.24 Moreover, B\u00e9rulle, after having been the ally of Cardinal Richelieu, became his enemy when he realised Richelieu was not so much seeking the victory of Roman Catholicism in Europe, but rather seeking \"to construct a political synthesis which would ensure the universal supremacy of the French monarchy\"; placing himself in alignment with the royal jurists. When B\u00e9rulle died in 1629, Richelieu transferred his hostility towards Vergier,25 mainly due to a theological debate regarding contrition (which had not been settled by the Council of Trent) that disinclined him to Vergier, making him, at least on this point, an ally of the Jesuits.\nVergier in his writings insisted on the necessity of a true 'inner conversion' (perfect contrition) for the salvation of a Christian; the only way, according to him, to be able to receive the sacraments of penance and the Eucharist. This process of inner conversion, called the practice of 'renewals', is necessarily long and, once the state of conversion has been reached, the penitent must make the graces he has received bear fruit, preferably by leading a life of retreat.26 This notion of an inner conversion is related to the doctrine of contrition in the remission of sins: that is, it was considered necessary to express love for God in order receive the sacraments. In opposition to Vergier, Richelieu, in his book \"Instruction du chr\u00e9tien\" ('Instruction of the Christian', 1619), along with the Jesuits, supported the thesis of attrition (imperfect contrition): that is, for them, the \"regret for sins based solely on the fear of hell\" is sufficient for one to receive the sacraments.29 The idea that the Eucharist should be received very infrequently, and that reception required much more than freedom from mortal sin, remained influential until it was finally condemned in the early 20th century by Pope Pius X, who endorsed frequent communion, as long as the communicant was free of mortal sin.\nIn 1602, Marie Ang\u00e9lique Arnauld, from the noble Arnauld family of Paris, became abbess of Port-Royal-des-Champs, a Cistercian convent in Magny-les-Hameaux. There, she reformed discipline after a conversion experience in 1608. In 1625, most of the nuns moved to Paris, forming the convent of Port-Royal de Paris. In 1634, after coming into contact with the Arnaulds, Vergier became the spiritual advisor of Port-Royal-des-Champs. There he put into practice his Augustinian vision of salvation, becoming in the process a good friend of Ang\u00e9lique Arnauld29 and convincing her of the rightness of Jansen's opinions. In 1637, Antoine Le Maistre, nephew of Ang\u00e9lique Arnaud, retreated to Port-Royal in order to immerse himself fully in the demanding spiritual practices he had learned from Vergier.28 He thus became the first of the \"Solitaires\" of Port-Royal, and his example would be followed by other pious men wishing to live in isolation.\nThe two convents became major strongholds of Jansenism. Under Ang\u00e9lique Arnauld, later with Vergier's support, Port-Royal-des-Champs developed a series of elementary schools, known as the \"Petites \u00e9coles de Port-Royal\" ('Little Schools of Port-Royal'); the most famous product of these schools was the playwright Jean Racine. Through Ang\u00e9lique Arnauld, Vergier had met her brother, Antoine Arnauld, became his protector and brought him to accept Jansen's position in . Following Vergier's death in 1643, Antoine Arnauld, by then a brilliant lawyer, priest and theologian at the Sorbonne (theological college of the University of Paris), became the chief proponent of Jansenism.\nBy allying with the Protestant princes against the Roman Catholic princes in the Thirty Years' War, Richelieu aroused the suspicion of the devout Jansenists, leading Vergier to condemn openly his (\"R.'s\") foreign policy. For this, Vergier was imprisoned in the Bastille in May 1638. The debate on the role of contrition and attrition in salvation was also one of the motives for his imprisonment. Vergier was not released until after Richelieu's death in 1642, and he died shortly thereafter, in 1643.\nFrom 1640, the Jesuits condemned Vergier's practice of renewals, which, according to them, risked discouraging the faithful and therefore distancing them from the sacraments.16 The Jesuits encouraged the faithful, whether or not they were struggling with sin, to receive the Eucharist frequently; arguing that Christ instituted it as a means to holiness for sinners, and that the only requirement for receiving Communion (apart from baptism) was that the communicant be free of mortal sin at the time of reception. Antoine Arnauld responded to them in 1643 with \"De la fr\u00e9quente communion\" ('Of frequent communion'), representing the deeply pessimistic theology of Jansenism, in which he opposed frequent Communion; arguing that a high degree of perfection, including purification from attachment to venial sin, was necessary before approaching the sacrament. Arnaud presented Jansen's ideas to the public in a more accessible form (e.g., his work was written in the vernacular, whereas \"Augustinus\" was written in Latin). His book was approved by fifteen bishops and archbishops, as well as twenty-one theologians of the Sorbonne and was widely distributed except in Jesuit circles.21\nIn 1644, Antoine Arnauld published an \"Apologie pour Jansenius\" ('Apology for Jansenius'), then a \"Seconde apologie\" ('Second apology') in the following year, and finally an \"Apologie pour M. de Saint-Cyran\" ('Apology for Saint-Cyran [i.e., Vergier]'). Arnauld also replied to Jesuit criticism with ('Moral Theology of the Jesuits'). The Jesuits then designated Nicolas Caussin (former confessor of Louis XIII) to write ('Response to the libel titled Moral Theology of the Jesuits') in 1644. Another Jesuit response was ('The impostures and ignorance of the libel titled Moral Theology of the Jesuits') by Fran\u00e7ois Pinthereau, under the pseudonym of \"abb\u00e9 de Boisic\", also in 1644. Pinthereau also wrote a critical history of Jansenism, ('The Birth of Jansenism Revealed to the Chancellor') in 1654. During the 1640s, Vergier's nephew, Martin de Barcos, who was once a theology student under Jansen, wrote several works defending his uncle.\nThe reception of \"Augustinus\" in France.\n\"Augustinus\" was first printed in France in 1641, then a second time in 1643, and was read widely in theological circles, including in Spanish Flanders and the Dutch Republic. The debate regarding Augustinianism in France was mainly introduced by the publication of \"Augustinus\", in which emphasis is placed on the Augustinian theory of grace and predestination.33\nThe Oratorians and Dominicans welcomed the work, along with a large number of theologians at the Sorbonne, ten of which approved the French editions. But the Jesuits immediately opposed it; they were supported by Cardinal Richelieu, and after his death in 1642, by Isaac Habert who attacked Jansen in his sermons at the Notre-Dame de Paris, and by the Feuillant theologian Pierre de Saint-Joseph who published a \"Defensio sancti Augusti\" ('Defence of Saint Augustine') in 1643.\nThese first years were not favourable to the Jansenists. The Archbishop of Paris, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Gondi, forbade the treatment of grace in publications and formally proscribed \"Augustinus\", but it nevertheless continued to circulate. On 1 August 1642, the Holy Office issued a decree condemning and forbidding its reading. The decree was powerless in France since the tribunal was unrecognised by the law. On 6 March 1642, Pope Urban VIII followed up with a papal bull titled , which condemned because it was published in violation of the order that no works concerning grace should be published without the prior permission of the Holy See. He also renewed the censures by Pope Pius V, in in 1567, and by Pope Gregory XIII, of several propositions of Baianism, arguing that they were repeated in .\n\"In eminenti\" was, for a time, treated as invalid because of an alleged ambiguity about the date of its publication. Jansenists attempted to prevent the reception of \"In eminenti\", both in Flanders and in France. They alleged that it could not be genuine, since the document attested to be promulgated at Rome on 6 March 1641, whereas the copy sent to Brussels by the nuncio at Cologne was dated in 1642. In reality, the difference was between the Old Style and New Style dates which were both still in use. Thanks to the agitation of the Jansenists in the \"Parlement\", its publication in France was delayed until January 1643.21 The faculty of the Sorbonne formally accepted the bull in 1644.\nThe five propositions.\nThe opponents of Jansenism wanted \"Augustinus\" to be more thoroughly condemned, since the Jesuits especially considered Jansenism to be heretical in the vein of Calvinism. Isaac Habert, ally of the late Richelieu, who became Bishop of Vabres, published in December 1646 a list of eight propositions taken from the \"Augustinus\" that he considered heretical. A few years later, in 1649, the syndic of the Sorbonne, Nicolas Cornet, frustrated by the continued circulation of \"Augustinus\", drew up a list of five propositions from the work and two from \"De la fr\u00e9quente communion\", then asked the Sorbonne faculty to condemn the propositions. Jansen's name was not explicitly mentioned, but it was obvious to all that he was being condemned.The cunning cyndic was careful not to give precise statements, as loyalty made it a duty; he did not attribute these propositions to anyone, and if anyone were to pronounce the name of Jansen, he would even say that it was not a question of him, \"Non agitur de Jansenio\", [It is not about Jansen], whereas inwardly, it was Jansen and him alone who was in question.81\nBefore the faculty could condemn the propositions, the \"parlement\" of Paris intervened and forbade the faculty to consider the propositions. The faculty then submitted the propositions to the Assembly of the French clergy in 1650. Consequently, Habert wrote to Pope Innocent X the same year, mentioning five of the initial seven propositions. In his letter, he does not directly mention Jansen, but describes the trouble caused in France by the publication of his work. The five propositions were not formally attributed to Jansen.84 The letter provoked controversy; more than ninety French bishops signed it, but it was immediately countered by thirteen Augustinian prelates, who wrote a letter of refutation to Rome. In this letter, the prelates denounced the five propositions as \"composed in ambiguous terms, which could only produce heated arguments\", and requested the pope to be careful not to condemn Augustinianism too hastily, which they considered to be the official doctrine of the Church on the question of grace. Among these bishops were Henri Arnauld, bishop of Angers and brother of Antoine Arnaud, and Nicolas Choart de Buzenval, bishop of Beauvais, who would later show fervent support for Port-Royal.85 At the same time, Antoine Arnaud openly doubted the presence of the five propositions in the work of Jansen, introducing the suspicion of manipulation on the part of the opponents of the Jansenists.\nThe prelates also asked Innocent X to appoint a commission similar to the to resolve the situation. Innocent X agreed to the majority's request, (that is, the request of the ninety bishops) but in an attempt to accommodate the view of the minority, appointed an advisory committee consisting of five cardinals and thirteen consultors to report on the situation. Over the next two years, this commission held 36 meetings including 10 presided by Innocent X. The supporters of Jansenism on the commission drew up a table with three heads: the first listed the Calvinist position (which was condemned as heretical), the second listed the Pelagian/Semipelagian position (as taught by the Molinists), and the third listed the correct Augustinian position (according to the Jansenists). Nevertheless, in 1653, Innocent X sided with the majority and condemned the propositions, promulgating in the form of a papal bull the apostolic constitution \"Cum occasione\". The first four propositions were declared heretical and the fifth false.\nThe bull was received favourably in France. Some Jansenists including Antoine Arnaud admitted that the propositions are heretical, but argued that they could not be found in \"Augustinus\". They maintained that Jansen and his \"Augustinus\" were orthodox, as they espoused only what Augustine himself taught, and they believed it was impossible that the pope could have condemned Augustine's opinion. Arnauld articulated a distinction as to how far the Church could bind the mind of a Roman Catholic. He argued that there is a distinction between matters \"de jure\" and \"de facto\": that a Roman Catholic was obliged to accept the Roman Catholic Church's opinion as to a matter of law (i.e., as to a matter of doctrine), but not as to a matter of fact. Arnauld argued that, while he agreed with the doctrine propounded in , he was not bound to accept the pope's determination of fact as to what doctrines were contained in Jansen's work. The Jansenists were therefore content with the notion that Jansen himself was not openly condemned, and further that Augustine's doctrine was still considered orthodox. This displeased the Jesuits and their supporters, who wanted a thoroughgoing condemnation of Jansenism. While the theological problem was technically resolved by Rome, hostility between the Jansenists and the Jesuits became increasingly pronounced.\nThe controversies between the Jansenists and the Molinists.\nEven before the promulgation of \"Cum occasione\", tensions between Jansenists and Jesuits defending Luis de Molina's thesis, the Molinists, had begun. In August 1649, Antoine Singlin, a priest near Port-Royal, preached on the occasion of the Feast of St. Augustine in Port-Royal. In his sermon, he emphasised efficacious grace, thus violating the order of his bishop who had forbidden the issue to be discussed. The ensuing controversy involved many Jansenists, in particular Henri Arnauld, bishop of Angers.19\nAfter the promulgation of the bull, the Jesuits exploited what was for them a victory, and restarted hostilities. In 1654, the Jesuit Fran\u00e7ois Annat published the \"Chicanes des jans\u00e9nistes\" ('Deceits of the Jansenists'), in which he expressed the idea that the pope had in fact condemned Augustinian doctrine, and that the five propositions were indeed contained in \"Augustinus\". Antoine Arnaud immediately responded, analysing the propositions and trying to show that they were inaccurate summaries of Jansen's views.\nCardinal Mazarin, in order to put an end to the hostilities, convoked the bishops in 1654 and then in 1655, demanding them to sign a declaration condemning the doctrine of Jansen. He recommended the signing of a similar declaration by all the clergy, but the bishops are quite reluctant, so Mazarin's demand remained unfulfilled in the majority of dioceses.20The first consequence of this attempt was the scandal involving the Duke of Liancourt (Roger du Plessis-Liancourt, Duke of La Roche-Guyon, known as the Duke of Liancourt). In January 1655, this ally of the Jansenists (his only granddaughter was a boarder at Port-Royal,)99 was refused absolution by a vicar of the Saint-Sulpice parish in Paris because of his Jansenist connections. Antoine Arnauld responded to this by publishing two pamphlets, \"Lettre \u00e0 une personne de condition\" ('Letter to a person of status', addressed to Liancourt) and \"Seconde lettre \u00e0 un duc et pair\" ('Second letter to a duke and peer', addressed to the Duke of Luyne). He denounced the arbitrariness of the vicar's action and condemned the Jesuits, who were, according to him, adherents to a 'lax morality', in plotting against Augustine's doctrine of grace. Arnauld declared that he assented to the papal condemnation in \"Cum occasione\", but remained silent on whether the condemned propositions could be attributed to Jansen. He openly disputed the concept of 'sufficient grace' defended by the Molinists.\nThe clarity of Arnauld's explication ironically prompted his adversaries to ask the College of Sorbonne to examine his last letter. The professors who were responsible for examining the letter were all openly hostile to Augustinianism. They extracted two propositions from the letter which were then condemned. On 31 January 1656, shockingly, Arnauld was barred from the Sorbonne, despite sixty professors having come to his defence. This event pushed Arnauld to retreat to Port-Royal, where he devoted himself to writing with a promising young theologian, Pierre Nicole. At the same time, Blaise Pascal undertook to defend him before public opinion, initiating the campaign with his \"Lettres Provinciales\".\nLater that year, the French Assembly of the Bishops voted to condemn Arnauld's distinction regarding the pope's ability to bind the mind of believers in matters of doctrine (\"de jure\") but not in matters of fact (\"de facto\"). They asked Pope Alexander VII to condemn Arnauld's proposition as heretical. Alexander VII responded, in the apostolic constitution \"Ad sanctam beati Petri sedem\" promulgated in 1656, that \"We declare and define that the five propositions have been drawn from the book of Jansenius entitled Augustinus, and that they have been condemned in the sense of the same Jansenius and we once more condemn them as such.\"\nBlaise Pascal and the campaign of the \"Provinciales\".\nWhen the censure of the \"Second letter to a duke and peer\" and the condemnation of Antoine Arnauld were certain, Blaise Pascal entered the controversy on the side of the Jansenists. He decided to devote himself to religion a little over a year before.8 His sister Jacqueline Pascal was one of the major figures at Port-Royal, and he himself had numerous dialogues with the Solitaires (notably the famous ).102\nPascal was invited by Arnauld to bring the matter before public opinion. On 23 January 1656, nine days before the first official condemnation of Arnauld, a fictional letter titled \"Lettre \u00e9crite \u00e0 un provincial par un de ses amis, sur le sujet des disputes pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 la Sorbonne\" (\"Letter written to a provincial by one of his friends, on the subject of the present disputes at the Sorbonne\"), was published secretively and anonymously. Seventeen other \"Provinciales\" followed, and on 24 March 1657, Pascal made a contribution to a work titled \"\u00c9crits des cur\u00e9s de Paris\" (\"Writings of Parisian priests\"),106 in which the moral laxity of the Jesuits was condemned.\nIn his \"Provinciales\", Pascal denies the existence of a 'Jansenist party'. According to Augustin Gazier, \"for the author of the \"Little Letters\", it was a matter of disabusing an overly credulous public, and of bringing out in all its light the perfect orthodoxy of those whom slander represented as heretics. Pascal did not hesitate to say that so-called 'Jansenism' was a chimera, a crude and abominable invention of the Jesuits, bitter enemies of Saint Augustine and of grace effective in itself.\"28\nThe \"Provinciales\" were a comprehensive defence of Augustinanism and an apology for Port-Royal, but they are best known for their ironical attacks made against the Jesuits, echoing Arnauld's (although unlike Arnauld, Pascal did not accede to but believed that the condemned doctrines were orthodox. Nevertheless, he emphasised Arnauld's distinction about matters \"de jure\" and \"de facto\"). They achieved great success among the cultured who formed public opinion at that time, as they appreciated Pascals' ridicule of the Jesuits, casuists and Molinists. If the first three letters are directly linked to the convictions of Antoine Arnauld, the following ones have a different purpose, since Pascal saw his convictions justified and so went on the counterattack. He violently attacked the Jesuits accused of advocating moral laxity. These letters, described as 'divine' by Marquess of S\u00e9vign\u00e9, were a campaign to change public opinion, turning the public away from theological questions towards the denigration of the supposed moral laxity of the Jesuits. This was not received well by certain Jansenists, who saw in the attacks contained in the letters a breach of Christian charity.\nThe placement of the letters in the Index of Prohibited Books by Rome represents a context in which Jansenism was moving away from a theological quarrel to a movement increasingly known and established in the secular world. According to Gazier, the main reason for this prohibition was not the theology (which was 'unassailable'), nor even the attacks against the Jesuits, but rather the fact that religious debates were raised in public, \"the doctrinal part of the \"Provinciales\" is unassailable; they could not be censored by the Sorbonne or condemned by the popes, and if they were put in the Index, like the \"Discourse on the Method\" [of Ren\u00e9 Descartes], it was because they were disapproved of for having treated, in French, for the people of the world and for women, contentious questions of which only scholars should have been aware.\"\nThe 'miracle of Saint-\u00c9pine', which occurred on 24 March 1656, was effective in reducing the attacks against Jansenism and popularising it among the public. The niece of Pascal, Marguerite P\u00e9rier, a boarder at Port-Royal, was cured of a lacrimal fistula that disfigured her, after having interacted with a relic of Saint-\u00c9pine. The Jansenists saw this as divine approval, and, with the Roman Catholic Church officially recognising the healing as a miracle, they were at peace for the moment.\nWhile the Church in France had left the quarrel aside, it was on the political front that the Jansenists became seriously worried.\nPolitical opposition to Jansenism.\nThough initially religious, the opposition to Jansenism quickly gained a political aspect. Upon the death of Louis XIII in 1643, Cardinal Mazarin took the same positions as his predecessor Richelieu in combatting the 'Jansenist party'. The 'Jansenist party' tended to attract former Frondeurs after the failure of their revolt in 1653. Although the Jansenists were not involved in the Fronde, they were quickly associated with the revolt because of the support they received from nobles such as Anne Genevi\u00e8ve de Bourbon, Duchess of Longueville (who had a house built in Port-Royal-des-Champs) and her brother Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti. The Arnauld family was suspected of being linked to the parliamentary Fronde. In addition, the actions of certain Solitaires to abandon worldly life and to withdraw completely from the Court worried Mazarin, who saw it as a possible source of political dissent.17\nIn 1657, the Assembly of the French clergy, relying on \"Ad sanctam beati Petri sedem\", drew up a formula of faith condemning Jansenism. The Assembly declared that signing the formula was compulsory for all French clergy. Many Jansenists remained firmly committed to Arnauld's distinction between matters \"de jure\" and \"de facto\", and refused to sign. The \"Petites \u00e9coles de Port-Royal\" (the 'Little Schools of Port-Royal') were thus dissolved. The archbishop of Paris, Hardouin de P\u00e9r\u00e9fixe de Beaumont, went several times to the monastery of Port-Royal to urge the nuns to sign the formula, but in vain. He therefore interdicted them from receiving the sacraments on 21 August 1664. This was a severe condemnation of Jansenism. A few days later, the leaders of the Jansenists were forced outside the monastery, then all the nuns who refused to sign were kept together at Port-Royal-des-Champs, while the nuns who did sign were gathered at the monastery in Paris.\nMazarin did not manage to fight effectively against Jansenism; rather it would be Louis XIV who achieved the near-total suppression of the movement. Early in his reign he was haunted by the memory of the Fronde, which proved to be his strongest opponent upon his true assumption of power in March 1660. In December 1660, he brought Mazarin together with the presidents of the Assembly asked them to proceed with coercing the clergy to sign the formula. The signing of the formula, which reiterated the condemnation of the five propositions by Innocent X in \"Cum occasione\", was, according to Jean-Pierre Chantin, \"a true test of orthodoxy imposed upon the entire clergy\".48 The Jansenists and the nuns of Port-Royal were divided as to what attitude to adopt. Antoine Arnauld applied the distinction between matters \"de jure\" and \"de facto\"; he agreed to condemn the propositions, but maintained reservations about their presence within \"Augustinus\". However, the ecclesiastical authorities rejected this distinction. Many priests and nuns refused to sign the formula.\nAs soon as Mazarin died, on 9 March 1661, Louis XIV ordered the dispersion of the novices and residents of the monasteries of Port-Royal-des-Champs and Port-Royal de Paris. The convent was also forbidden to accept new novices, which guaranteed that it would eventually die out. Affairs were further complicated by several bishops who also desired to maintain the distinction between matters \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" regarding the formula. This was the case with four noteworthy bishops, who were condemned by Rome and Louis XIV: Fran\u00e7ois-\u00c9tienne Caulet, bishop of Pamiers, Nicolas Pavillon, bishop of Al\u00e8s, Nicolas Choart de Buzenval, bishop of Beauvais and Henri Arnauld, Bishop of Angers.\nFormulary controversy: 1664\u20131669.\nAt the urging of several bishops, and at the personal insistence of King Louis XIV, Pope Alexander VII sent to France the apostolic constitution \"Regiminis Apostolici\" in 1664, which required, according to the , \"all ecclesiastical personnel and teachers\" to subscribe to an included formulary, the \"Formula of Submission for the Jansenists\".n. 2020\nThe formula was the basis of the Formulary Controversy. Many Jansenists refused to sign it; while some did sign, they made it known that they were agreeing only to the doctrine (matters \"de jure\"), not the allegations asserted by the bull (matters \"de facto\"). The latter category included the four Jansenist-leaning bishops, who communicated the bull to their flocks along with messages that maintained the distinction between doctrine and fact. This angered both Louis XIV and Alexander VII, who commissioned nine French bishops to investigate the situation.\nAlexander VII died in 1667 before the commission concluded its investigation and his successor, Pope Clement IX, initially appeared willing to continue the investigation of the nine Jansenist-leaning bishops. However, in France, Jansenists conducted a campaign arguing that allowing a papal commission of this sort would constitute a renouncement of the traditional liberties of the Gallican Church, thus playing on traditional French opposition to ultramontanism. They convinced one member of the cabinet (Lyonne) and nineteen bishops of their position. These bishops argued, in a letter to Clement IX, that the infallibility of the Church applied only to matters of revelation, and not to matters of fact. They asserted that this was the position of Caesar Baronius and Robert Bellarmine. They also argued in a letter to Louis XIV that allowing the investigation to continue would result in political discord.\nUnder these circumstances, the papal nuncio to France recommended that Clement IX accommodate the Jansenists. Clement agreed, and appointed C\u00e9sar d'Estr\u00e9es, Bishop of Laon, as a mediator in the matter. Two bishops who had signed the letter to the pope, Louis Henri de Pardaillan de Gondrin, Archbishop of Sens, and F\u00e9lix Vialart de Herse, Bishop of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne, assisted d'Estr\u00e9es. D'Estr\u00e9es convinced the four bishops, Arnauld, Choart de Buzenval, Caulet and Pavillon, to sign the \"Formula of Submission for the Jansenists\" (though it seems they may have believed that signing the formulary did not mean assent to the matters \"de facto\" that it contained). The pope, initially happy that the four bishops had signed, became angry when he was informed that they had done so with reservations. Clement IX ordered his nuncio to conduct a new investigation. Reporting back, the nuncio declared: \"they have condemned and caused to be condemned the five propositions with all manner of sincerity, without any exception or restriction whatever, in every sense in which the Church has condemned them\". However, he reported that the four bishops continued to be evasive as to whether they agreed with the pope as to the matter \"de facto\". In response, Clement IX appointed a commission of twelve cardinals to further investigate the matter. This commission determined that the four bishops had signed the formula in a less than entirely sincere manner, but recommended that the matter should be dropped to forestall further divisions in the Church. Foreign wars also pressured Louis XIV to avoid internal conflict. The pope agreed and thus issued four briefs, declaring the four bishops' agreement to the formula was acceptable, thus instituting the \"Paix cl\u00e9mentine\" ('Clementine Peace') which lasted from 1669 to 1679.\nThe Clementine Peace.\nAlthough the peace of Clement IX was a lull in the public theological controversy, several clergymen remained attracted to Jansenism. Three major groups were:\nDuring the Clementine Peace, the Jansenists tried to avoid unnecessary controversy, especially since the growing absolutism of Louis XIV made the attraction of former Frondeurs to Port-Royal and Jansenism suspect. This is why Blaise Pascal's \"Pens\u00e9es\" (published posthumously in 1670) and Pierre Nicole's \"Essais de morale et d'instruction th\u00e9ologiques\" ('Essays on moral and theological instruction') are devoid of any theological or political controversy.\nThe Jansenists at this time distinguished themselves by the quality of their intellectual work and by their desire to communicate matters of religion to the faithful. Louis-Isaac Lemaistre de Sacy thus published a French New Testament in 1667. Published secretively in Mons (in the Spanish Netherlands), it was condemned by the pope in 1668 because it translated the sacred text into the vernacular and with allegedly Jansenising edits.28 He then undertook a translation of the Vulgate, starting in 1672, which was not completed until 1695. These thirty volumes are considered an essential text in Biblical scholarship. The \"Bible de Sacy\" ('Sacy Bible'), like Pascal's \"Pens\u00e9es\", is considered to be a reputable example of the classical French language of the 17th century.\nDespite this intense intellectual activity, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, in his work \"Port-Royal\", rightly says that it was only a period of respite before further troubles.The ten years which followed the Clementine Peace were for Port-Royal ten years of glory, fundamentally of decline, but of a veiled, embellished decline; these were the beautiful hours of a sweet autumn, of a rich and warm sunset. In an instant, solitude bloomed again and became commonplace, more enamelled than ever. The old spirit within continued and adapted again without much struggle.\nRenewed persecution after the Clementine Peace.\nThe death of the Duchess of Longueville, protector of Port-Royal and the Jansenists, in 1679, as well as the signing of the Treaties of Nijmegen and of Saint-Germain the same year, left Louis XIV with a free hand to resume his persecution of Jansenism.\nIn agreement with the king, the new archbishop of Paris, Fran\u00e7ois de Harlay de Champvallon, expelled the novices and confessors (seventy people) from the monastery of Port-Royal-des-Champs and banned recruitment. Following this measure, the main Jansenist theologians went into exile: Pierre Nicole settled in Spanish Flanders until 1683, Antoine Arnauld took refuge in Brussels in 1680 and was joined by Jacques Joseph Duguet in 1685, an Augustinian Oratorian.28\nIn 1696, the work of Martin de Barcos (nephew of Jean du Vergier de Hauranne), \"Expression de la foi catholique touchant la gr\u00e2ce et la pr\u00e9destination\" ('Expression of the Catholic faith, touching on grace and predestination'), was published by the Benedictine Gabriel Gerberon, then in exile in Holland. This work was immediately condemned by the archbishop of Paris, Louis Antoine de Noailles, although he was very deferential towards Augustine's writings. Notably, he approved Pasquier Quesnel's \"R\u00e9flexions morales\" in 1694, due its markedly Augustinian character. The Jansenists reacted strongly to the condemnation of Barcos' book, and criticised Noailles.\nPasquier Quesnel and his \"R\u00e9flexions morales\": 1692\u20131710.\nQuesnel was also a member of the Oratory of Jesus in Paris from 1657 until 1681, when he was expelled on account of his Jansenism. He sought the protection of Pierre du Cambout de Coislin, bishop of Orl\u00e9ans, who harbored Quesnel for four years, until Quesnel joined Antoine Arnauld in Brussels in 1689. In 1692, Quesnel published the \"Nouveau Testament en fran\u00e7ais avec des r\u00e9flexions morales sur chaque verset\" ('New Testament in French with moral reflections on each verse'), a devotional guide to the New Testament that laid out the Jansenist position in strong terms. This work, consistently republished because of its success, was classically Augustinian. Quesnel remained measured on questions of grace, but on the other hand was fiercely Gallican in the vein of Edmond Richer. Indeed, Quesnel was seen as the functional successor of Antoine Arnauld upon his death in 1694, and therefore as the leader of the 'Jansenist party'.\nThe \"R\u00e9flexions morales\" did not initially arouse controversy; not only was it recommended by Noailles but it was also approved for publication by F\u00e9lix Vialart de Herse, bishop of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne. However, in the years that followed, several bishops became aware of the book's Jansenist tendencies and issued condemnations: Joseph-Ignace de Foresta, bishop of Apt, in 1703; Charles-B\u00e9ningne Herv\u00e9, bishop of Gap, in 1704; and both Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph de Grammont, bishop of Besan\u00e7on, and \u00c9douard Barged\u00e9, bishop of Nevers, in 1707. When the Holy Office drew the to the attention of Clement XI, he issued the papal brief (1708), proscribing the book for \"savouring of the Jansenist heresy\". As a result, in 1710, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de l'Escure de Valderil, bishop of Lu\u00e7on, and \u00c9tienne de Champflour, bishop of La Rochelle, forbade the reading of the book in their dioceses.\n\"Case of Conscience\": 1701\u20131709.\nThe tensions generated by the continuing presence of these elements in the French Roman Catholic Church came to a head in the Case of Conscience of 1701, which was initiated by a priest from Clermont-Ferrand. The case involved the question of whether or not absolution should be given to a cleric who refused to affirm the infallibility of the Church in matters \"de facto\" (even if he did not preach against it but merely maintained a 'respectful silence'). A provincial conference, consisting of forty theology professors from the Sorbonne, headed by No\u00ebl Alexandre, declared that the cleric should receive absolution.\nThe publication of this 'Case of Conscience' provoked outrage among the anti-Jansenist elements in the Roman Catholic Church. The decision given by the scholars was condemned by several French bishops; by Cardinal Louis Antoine de Noailles, archbishop of Paris; by the theological faculties at Leuven, Douai and eventually Paris; and, finally, in 1703, by Pope Clement XI. The scholars who had signed the Case of Conscience then backed away, all of the signatories withdrew their signatures and the theologian who had championed the result of the Case of Conscience, Nicolas Petitpied, was expelled from the Sorbonne.\nLouis XIV and his grandson, Philip V of Spain, then asked the pope to issue a papal bull condemning the practice of maintaining a 'respectful silence' as to the issue of the infallibility of the Church in matters \"de facto\".\nThe pope obliged, issuing the apostolic constitution , on 16 July 1705. At the subsequent Assembly of the French Clergy, all those present, except P.-Jean-Fr. de Percin de Montgaillard, bishop of Saint-Pons, voted to accept and Louis XIV promulgated it as binding law in France.\nDissolution of Port-Royal and promulgation of \"Unigenitus\": 1708\u20131713.\nLouis XIV also sought the dissolution of Port-Royal-des-Champs, the stronghold of Jansenist thought, and this was achieved in 1708 when the pope issued a bull enacting this. The remaining nuns were forcibly removed in 1709 and dispersed among various other French convents and the buildings were razed in 1709. The convent of Port-Royal de Paris remained in existence until it was closed in the general dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution.All these condemnations allowed Louis XIV to make arguments to definitively reduce the movement to a 'republican sect', that is to say, a sect opposed to the royal absolutist regime. Taking advantage of the War of the Spanish Succession, he had Quesnel imprisoned by Humbertus Guilielmus de Precipiano, archbishop of Mechelen in the Spanish Netherlands in 1703, and had all his papers seized, although he escaped and fled to Amsterdam, where he lived for the remainder of his life. This was followed by the arrest of the entire network of correspondents woven by Quesnel over fifteen years throughout France. The centres of the secret publication of Jansenist writings were discovered, forcing Jansenists to flee abroad, most often to the Spanish Netherlands or the Dutch Republic, passing through monasteries such as the abbey of Hautefontaine, on the border between Champagne and independent Lorraine.\nLouis XIV asked the pope for a final condemnation, specifically for the \"R\u00e9flexions morales\" of Quesnel. Clement XI sent a papal brief in 1708, but it was not received by the \"parlement\" of Paris. The Jesuit priest Michel Le Tellier, the king's confessor, tried to convince the bishops to ask for a formal condemnation of the work, but unsuccessfully. The king therefore asked the pope for a papal bull condemning the book. In response, Clement XI promulgated the bull \"Unigenitus Dei Filius\" on 8 September 1713. It was written with the contribution of Gregorio Selleri, a lector at the College of Saint Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\", and later Master of the Sacred Palace, fostered the condemnation of Jansenism by condemning one hundred and one propositions from the of Quesnel as heretical, and as identical with propositions already condemned in the writings of Jansen. These propositions as well as the work itself are seen as a summary of Jansenist doctrine.\nThe reception of the papal bull \"Unigenitus\".\nBy condemning the one hundred and one propositions taken from Quesnel's \"R\u00e9flexions morales\", the papal bull \"Unigenitus\" marks a significant turning point in the history of Jansenism. Those Jansenists who accepted the bull became known as \"acceptants\".\nThe bull saw in the propositions listed a summary of Jansenism, but, in addition to questions relating to the problem of grace, traditional positions on Gallicanism and the theology of Edmond Richer are condemned, which brought even more theologians to oppose the Jansenists, who in turn felt threatened.\nThe atmosphere of the final years of the reign of the aging Louis XIV was characterised by opposition to the bull. To actually be applied, the bull had to be registered with the \"parlement\" of Paris. However, the \"parlement\" refused to ratify the bull until the French bishops had taken a position on it, believing that they had no authority over religious matters deriving from their political power.241 Several bishops, and with them many theologians, publicly proposed the calling (\"appellation\") of a general council to resolve the question; they were thus called the \"appelants\". Between 1713 and 1731, more than a thousand pamphlets were published on this subject.\nIn the midst of this dispute, Louis XIV died in 1715, and the government of France was taken over by Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, regent for the five-year-old Louis XV. Unlike Louis XIV, who had stood solidly behind \"Unigenitus\", Philippe II expressed ambivalence during the \"R\u00e9gence\" period. With the change in political mood, three theological faculties that had previously voted to accept \"Unigenitus\" (Paris, Nantes and Reims) voted to rescind their acceptance. The Duke of Orl\u00e9ans was not a friend of the Jesuits; he hastened to dismiss Michel Le Tellier, the former confessor of Louis XIV, who he replaced with Abbot Claude Fleury, a Gallican suspected of Jansenism, as confessor and tutor of the young Louis. At the demand of the bishops to refuse the bull, he wrote to Clement XI to request clarifications and rectifications for \"Unigenitus\". The pope refused, appealing to his infallibility (although papal infallibility was not a dogma until its proclamation at the First Vatican Council, it was more and more often put forward and accepted during the disputes of this era). Aspiring to continuity with the reign of Louis XIV, the Regent considered himself bound to fulfill the promise of his predecessor, which was to seek a compromise that offended neither the pope nor the Gallican clergy. Augustin Gazier describes this as a fundamentally political rather than religious settlement.\n[The] Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, who was not a believer, subordinated religion to politics. He was imbued with the idea that royalty never dies, and that consequently kings are destined to make the same mistakes as their predecessors; they are in continuity with each other. [... Louis XIV] had promised the pope to receive the bull \"Unigenitus\", and the pope insisted that the promise be strictly kept; Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans therefore saw the need to satisfy Clement XI and consequently to bring the recalcitrant prelates to a compromise, if it were not absolutely impossible.\nHowever the discussions between the different parties were a failure, and in 1717, opposition to the bull became more direct. In March, four bishops filed a notarial deed at the Sorbonne, demanding a general council to appeal \"Unigenitus\". They were joined by hundreds of French priests, monks and nuns and were supported by the \"parlements\". For this they relied on the \"Declaration of the Clergy of France\" of 1682, which was approved by the Assembly of the French clergy and by Louis XIV. This important expression of Gallicanism placed the authority of a general council over the pope. The four bishops were Jean Soanen, bishop of Senez, Charles Joachim Colbert, bishop of Montpellier, Pierre de La Broue, bishop of Mirepoix and Pierre de Langle, bishop of Boulogne. The Inquisition condemned this appeal in 1718 and the pope excommunicated the bishops and the \"appelants\" through the letters \"Pastoralis officii\". Far from disarming the French clergy, many of whom were then advocating conciliarism, the clergy who had appealed \"Unigenitus\" to a general council, then appealed \"Pastoralis officii\" to a general council as well. They renewed their appeal in 1719, accompanied by the archbishop of Paris Louis Antoine de Noailles, then again in 1720. After examining propositions condemned by \"Unigenitus,\" Noailles determined that as set out in the bull and apart from their context in the , some of the propositions condemned by the pope were in fact orthodox. He therefore refused to accept the bull and joined the party of the \"appelants\". In total, one cardinal, 18 bishops, and 3,000 clergy of France supported an appeal to a general council. However, the majority of clergy in France (four cardinals, 100 bishops, 100,000 clergymen) stood by the pope.\nThe Regent decided to put an end to this dispute. In 1722, he reinstated the obligation to sign the \"Formula of Submission for the Jansenists\" in order to obtain benefits or university degrees. This policy was maintained until the end of the regency and many \"appelants\" received \"lettres de cachet\" ('letters of the signet') which announced their arrest without trial on the king's authority, from 1724 to 1725. In 1727, Jean Soanen, who had been the \"de facto\" leader of Jansenism since the death of Quesnel, was condemned by the Synod of Embrun led by the future Cardinal de Tencin. He was exiled to La Chaise-Dieu by a \"lettre de cachet\", where he died in 1740. In 1728, Noailles finally submitted to the Pope and assented to \"Unigenitus\".\nThe conviction of Soanen, which the Jansenists described in their writings as the 'brigandage of Embrun', caused discontent among the \"appelants\", but Noailles' successor in Paris wanted to silence the resistance. The new archbishop Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume de Vintimille du Luc banished nearly three hundred Jansenist priests from his diocese, and closed the main sanctuaries of the movement, the Saint-Magloire seminary, the College of Sainte Barbe and the House of Sainte-Agathe, all three in Paris.35 In 1730, the bull became state law. Clergy who had not signed the formula could no longer retain their ecclesiastical offices, which were considered vacant.\nThe \"appelants\" consisted of, between 1717 and 1728, more than seven thousand clerics and around thirty prelates (with one hundred thousand members of the laity under their authority). Not all were Jansenists, but the Gallican fringe of the clergy was still shaken by the intransigence of Clement XI. The territorial distribution of the Jansenists and Gallicans in France at the beginning of the 18th century is known.32 At its peak in 1718, the convocation movement affected forty-five dioceses, but it was mainly the dioceses of Paris, Ch\u00e2lons, Tours, Senez and Auxerre that were prominent as well as the archdiocese of Lyon.\nThe popularisation of Jansenism.\nJansenists, from the 17th century onwards, tended to rely on miracle stories to justify their cause. One of the first and most notable was the healing of Marguerite P\u00e9rier in 1656 by the relic of Sainte-\u00c9pine, which occurred when Jansenism was beginning to be seriously attacked, and was followed in that century by numerous reports of other miracles. Certain Jansenists thus gained a reputation as thaumaturges and their relics were in high demand. For example, the abbot of Pontch\u00e2teau, \"Solitaire\" and 'gardener' of Port-Royal, had his coffin forced open in 1690 after a little girl was healed during his funeral.46 Increasingly, Jansenism was becoming a public affair involving the miraculous. The democratisation of the conflict among parish priests caused by the bull \"Unigenitus\" and monarchical oppression only strengthened this trend. There were several miracles linked directly or indirectly to Jansenism between 1710 and 1730. They were not directly instigated by the \"appelant\" priests, but very often took place in their parishes, such as a miracle of 1725, in which Madame Lafosse, the wife of a cabinetmaker, was healed during a Eucharistic procession in the parish of Sainte-Marguerite in Paris, in which the parish priest (and bearer of the monstrance) was a notorious \"appelant\". The miracle was recognised, processions were made and the stories were popularised by brochures and engravings.46\nThe struggle of the \"appelants\" was supported by numerous brochures explaining the points of dispute plainly and for a general reading public. The faithful were invited to form their own opinion of the controversy, by the exhortation of priests such as the Oratorian Vivien de La Borde. The press, whether public or underground, also involved itself in religious matters. The Jansenists began a public debate with the pamphlet \"Suppl\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Gazette d'Hollande\" ('Supplement to the Gazette of Holland'). The Jansenists responded with \"Nouvelles eccl\u00e9siastiques ou M\u00e9moires pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la constitution \u00abUnigenitus\u00bb\" ('Ecclesiastical news or Memoirs to serve as a basis for a history of the constitution \"Unigenitus\"').73\nThis weekly paper was already circulating in handwritten form, but it was printed secretively from 1728. With a circulation of six thousand copies a week, it reached a very wide audience, in all social classes. The \"Nouvelles \u00e9cclesiastiques\" served to popularise the debate and to establish links between different Jansenist groups. The Jansenists also published anti-Jesuit propaganda and played a central role in plotting and promoting the expulsion of the Jesuits from France in 1762\u201364. The paper ceased to exist in 1803.\nThe Jansenist clergy developed a unique interpretation of the time of persecution they were experiencing; a hermeneutic of the Bible known as \"figurism\", which almost certainly originates from the teaching of the Oratorian Jacques Joseph Duguet in around 1710. For Duguet, just as the Old Testament prefigured the coming of Christ, so the stories and prophecies of the Scriptures, especially the Book of Revelation, prefigure (or are \"figures\" of) current or future events. Thus the bull \"Unigenitus\", considered an error of the pope and the Church, was the beginning of great upheavals that would announce the return of the Prophet Elijah. Following his return, Christ will reign for a thousand years with the elect and the 'Friends of the Truth' who believe in efficacious grace, also converting the Jews. This vision of time and events, mainly taught at the seminary of Saint-Magloire in Paris by Abbot d'\u00c9temare, spread among the clergy and the public. For the Jansenists, it was a way of interpreting their persecution and status as a dwindling minority. They saw themselves as defending the cause of divine truth alone, against a church and secular authority who betrayed it.\nThe popularisation of Jansenism can also be attributed to their pastoral theology which led to popular education and assistance.\nThe phenomenon of the \"Convulsionnaires\" of Saint-M\u00e9dard.\nFrom 1731, the dramatic popularisation of Jansenism gave rise to the phenomenon of the \"convulsionnaires\". Initially a series of miracles linked to the tomb of the Jansenist deacon Fran\u00e7ois de P\u00e2ris in the Saint-M\u00e9dard Cemetery in Paris, including religious ecstasy, the phenomenon transformed into an expression of opposition to papal and royal authority. The convulsions spread among the Parisian people including the bourgeoisie during the 1730s. The connection between the larger French Jansenist movement and the smaller, more radical phenomenon is difficult to state with precision. Brian Strayer noted, in \"Suffering Saints\", almost all were Jansenists, but very few Jansenists embraced the phenomenon.236 Nevertheless, the phenomenon persisted until the 19th century.\n\"The format of their seances changed perceptibly after 1732,\" according to Strayer. \"Instead of emphasizing prayer, singing, and healing miracles, believers now participated in 'spiritual marriages' (which occasionally bore earthly children), encouraged violent convulsions [...] and indulged in the \"secours\" (erotic and violent forms of torture), all of which reveals how neurotic the movement was becoming.\" The movement descended into brutal cruelties that \"clearly had sexual overtones\" in their practices of penance and mortification of the flesh. In 1735, the \"parlements\" regained jurisdiction over the \"convulsionnaires\", which changed into an underground movement of clandestine sects. The next year \"an alleged plot\" by \"convulsionnaire\" revolutionaries to overthrow the and assassinate Louis XV was thwarted. The \"Augustinian \" were then absconded from Paris to avoid police surveillance. This \"further split the Jansenist movement.\"\nAccording to Strayer, by 1741 the leadership was \"dead, exiled, or imprisoned,\" and the movement was divided. The police's role increased and the \"parlements\"' role decreased \"in the social control of Jansenism\" but cells continued engaging in seances, torture, and apocalyptic and treasonous rhetoric. Strayer related a case of torture documented in 1757 where a woman was \"beat [...] with garden spades, iron chains, hammers, and brooms [...] jabbed [...] with swords, pelted [...] with stones, buried [...] alive, [...] crucified.\" In another case documented in 1757, a woman \"was cut with a knife numerous times\" causing gangrene. By 1755 there were fewer than eight hundred \"convulsionnaires\" in France. In 1762 the criminalized some of their practices \"as 'potentially dangerous' to human life.\" The last crucifixion was documented in 1788.282\nJansenism in the \"parlements\".\nThe conjunction of Jansenism and parlementarism.\nThe \"parlements\" of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\", and in particular the \"parlement\" of Paris, had long been defenders of Gallicanism against Rome. From the beginning of the Jansenist controversy, the \"parlements\" tended to sympathise with Jansenists, reluctant to register the papal bulls condemning the movement.\nThis happened upon the promulgation of the bull \"Unigenitus\". The Attorney General, Henri Fran\u00e7ois d'Aguesseau, considered the promulgation of the bull to be proof of the fallibility of the Pope. He encouraged parlementarians not to accept the bull and to wait for a reaction from the bishops. It was necessary for Louis XIV to use letters patent to force registration of the bull. Despite this, the letters \"Pastoralis officii\" were not received in 1718, which alleviated the fears of the \"appelants\" in the short term.In fact, a \"lit de justice\" was required for the bull to be registered as state law in 1730, so great was the resistance by the \"parlements\".\nRen\u00e9 Taveneaux, in his \"Jansenism and Politics\", underlines the importance of Jansenist recruitment among the parlementarians of the 18th century. According to him, Jansenism had a \"bourgeois base\", which dated back to the 17th century, with the Arnauld, Lemaistre, Pascal and other families who were considered Nobles of the Robe. Marie-Jos\u00e9 Michel also underlines the attraction of entire elite families to Port-Royal and Jansenism from the beginning of the movement, and writes of a \"proliferating Jansenisation of elites\".\nLucien Goldmann's thesis is that this was an expression of a class spirit that had taken root during the Fronde, along with a discontent regarding the centralising absolutist monarchy. Faced with the growing power of the royal commissioners, to the detriment of the officials (of bourgeois recruitment), the latter practiced an increasingly anti-establishment \"critical retreat from the world\". Taveneaux moderates this interpretation with a Marxist analysis of a \"meeting ground\" between Jansenism and the bourgeoisie, arguing that the bourgeois noble was free under the Ancien R\u00e9gime, detached from the seigneurial hierarchy, and that this individualistic situation, was, by some, easily associated with Jansenist morality, which preferred the development of the interior life in contrast to the splendour of Tridentine liturgy, and a demanding moral rigorism rather than the easily accessible sacraments characteristic of Jesuit theology. The essentially urban basis of Jansenism also allowed this 'meeting ground' between it and the parliamentary bourgeoisie.\nThe Jansenist cause and the revolt of the \"parlements\".\nThe \"parlements\", especially that of Paris, were in constant rebellion against monarchical power during the 18th century. Jansenists and \"appelants\" therefore found the parliamentarians to be a close ally. Moreover, the weapon of the Jansenists to resist both the king and the pope was legal; the 'appeal as from an abuse', in order to protest an injustice and deny the pope's or a bishop's right to exercise their authority on a specific point. The \"appelants\" brought their demands before the \"parlement\", an organ of justice in which the Jansenist magistrates would employ their rhetoric and legal arsenal to combine the Jansenist cause with a defence of the independence of the \"parlements\", thus winning the support of parliamentarians who were Gallicans or resistant to royal power. However, \"most often, Jansenist magistrates carefully avoided any reference to religious convictions, aware that a theological discourse would have been inadmissible in an assembly of judges.\"155 Jansenism was therefore readily confused with the incessant parliamentary struggles of the 18th century, while its theological nature faded. Numerically speaking, the presence of Jansenists was modest. For Paris, about a quarter of magistrates in the 1730s were Jansenists, including a group of lawyers influential enough to initiate two general strikes of their order in 1732 with the aim of bolstering the independence of the \"parlement\".\nOne of these influential lawyers was Louis Adrien Le Paige. Bailiff of the Tour du Temple, which bore the right of asylum and was therefore one of the most important hubs of the Jansenist network, taking advantage of the right to harbour numerous banned publications. The Temple also housed the famous 'Perrette box', which contained the Jansenists' financing fund; an object of curiosity and fantasy among anti-Jansenists. Another of these lawyers was Gabriel-Nicolas Maultrot, nicknamed the 'second-class lawyer' because of the many \"appelant\" priests he defended.\nThe most significant conflict involving the parliamentarians and Jansenism was the affair of the 'confession notes'. In 1746, the archbishop of Paris Christophe de Beaumont proposed that the faithful must be able to provide a proof of a 'confession note' signed by a priest who approved \"Unigenitus\" in order to receive extreme unction. The measure encountered major opposition, and many legal appeals were filed which were quashed by the king's council. In 1749, a large demonstration occurred after the burial of a Jansenist college principal who died without being granted confession. Among the four thousand people who comprised the procession, there were many parliamentarians.\nAn important religious event of the second half of the 18th century was the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1764, which united Jansenism and the monarchy for a time. However, Jansenism joined the side of the magistrates in their revolt against the policies of Chancellor de Maupeou and his Triumvirate to destroy the parliamentary system. The most radical members of the revolt joined what was called the 'patriot party', the spearhead of pre-Revolutionary protest. The synthesis of their struggles and demands with the theses of Jean-Jacques Rousseau was to give substance to the ideological beginnings of the French Revolution.\nJansenism and the French Revolution.\nThe role of the Jansenists in the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.\nAmong the early defenders of the French Revolution were personalities known for their Gallicanism, sympathy for Jansenism and more or less marked adherence to the theology of Edmond Richer. The role of the Jansenists in the Revolution was essentially a product of the ecclesiological character of late Jansenism, which was tinged with Gallicanism.\nThe role of Jansenising priests was noted from the beginning of the Revolution. Indeed, without the addition of a few priests to the Third Estate during the assembly of the Estates General of 1789, it would not have been able to declare itself a National Assembly on 17 June 1789. These priests were led by Abbot Henri Gr\u00e9goire, whose attachment to Port-Royal and Jansenism was known. Gr\u00e9goire shared with the Jansenists a figurist vision of history, which underlay his statement that the Revolution was part of the fulfilment of God's will. Around Gr\u00e9goire and the priests favourable to the Revolution mainly Gallicans and other Jansenists from the \"parlements\" gathered together. Louis Adrien Le Paige was generally favourable to the Revolution. Likewise, Armand-Gaston Camus and Jean-Denis Lanjuinais, renowned parliamentarians, were heavily involved in Revolutionary events while remanining attached to the Jansenist cause. Lanjuinais was notably a member of the ecclesiastical committee which prepared the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The importance of Jansenists in the drafting of this constitution, so favourable to their demands on many points, meant that the Abbot Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s attacked those who \"seem to have seen in the Revolution merely a superb opportunity to lift up the theological importance of Port-Royal and to establish the apotheosis of Jansenius over the tomb of his enemies\". The Civil Constitution of the Clergy satisfied the Jansenists on many points; it put an end to practices that were widely criticised, for example the residence of bishops outside of their dioceses or non-canonical benefices. The Constitution reinstated diocesan synods, considerably reduced the influence of the pope and reproved formulas such as that of Alexander VII. Furthermore, it satisfied the wealthy fringe of the clergy by establishing election within the Gallican Church and by promoting cooperation between parish priests and prelates, rather than a relationship of subordination.\nFor these Jansenists, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and all the ecclesiastical constitution that resulted from it were nothing other than the culmination of all the religious and parliamentary struggles of the 18th century. Dale K. Van Kley lists five points which brought together the interests of Gallican Jansenists and those of France in the early Revolution, and which Camus in particular developed.\nThe Jansenist and Gallican influence in the Civil Constitution of the Clergy explains why so many of the new constitutional bishops were classified as Jansenists or at least as Jansenist sympathisers. Thus, in addition to Abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire, bishop of Blois and \"de facto\" head of the Constitutional Church, were Claude Debertier, Jean-Baptiste Pierre Saurine, Louis Charrier de La Roche and about fifteen others who, without necessarily being \"appelants\", nevertheless identified themselves strongly with Jansenism and Richer.\nLaypeople and clerics joined the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de philosophie chr\u00e9tienne\" ('Society of Christian philosophy'), which pursued religious studies during the Revolution in a strongly Jansenist spirit. In the final years of the Revolution, the Society published the \"Annales de la religion\" ('Annals of religion'), a Gallican and Jansenist journal, which published the first version of Abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire's \"Ruines de Port-Royal des Champs en 1801\" ('Ruins of Port-Royal-des-Champs in 1801'). Members of the Society frequently took residences for reflection at Port-Royal-des-Champs, and were in close contact with the Italian Jansenists Eustache Degola and Scipione de' Ricci.\nThere were, however, a significant number of Jansenists who completely rejected the Revolution. As for clergymen, the best known were Henri Jabineau and Dom Deforis. But others, like Abbots Mey, Dall\u00e9as and the Oratorian clergy of Lyon, were also very much in opposition to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. They were supported by canonists like Gabriel-Nicolas Maultrot, and by pious laypeople such as Nicolas Bergasse in Lyon or Louis Silvy in Paris. Some, like Augustin-Jean-Charles Cl\u00e9ment, a notable Jansenist, swore the oath of loyalty to the Constitution, but only with great hesitation.\nAnalysis of the Jansenist involvement in the Revolution.\nLet the Constituent Assembly, once it has emerged from the stormy discussions that mark its beginning and the votes of its major state laws, address the civil constitution of the clergy; Jansenist inspiration will preside over the organisation of the new Church. Camus will triumph over Louis XIV; the ecclesiastical committee will avenge the ashes of Port-Royal, and the Jansenist legislators who spoke so much about returning to the organisation of the Early Church will in fact return it to martyrdom. (Abb\u00e9 Sicard, \"The Old Clergy of France\", 1893)Jansenism is often cited, if not as one of the causes of the Revolution, at least as having shaped the state of mind necessary for its outbreak. This accusation was first made by counter-revolutionaries, who saw the Jansenists as allies of Protestants and Freemasons; others supposedly responsible for the fall of the French monarchy. Even if the reasons for this accusation are erroneous, there was a strong link between Jansenism and the Revolution.\nFor the counter-revolutionaries and ultramontanists of the 19th century, Jansenism was accused of having prepared and accompanied the Revolution for the following reasons.\nAmong 19th-century republicans, who were quite favourable to Port-Royal and Jansenism as movements which fought against absolute monarchy and royal authority, there were also defenders of the theory according to which the Jansenists were largely responsible for the outbreak of the Revolution. Thus Jules Michelet, Louis Blanc, Henri Martin and Charles-Louis Chassin argued for a partly Jansenist origin of the Revolution.\nIf it is possible to associate Jansenism and the Revolution outside the religious domain, it is because there was a tradition of protest among Jansenists and because socially, those who drove the Revolution (bourgeoisie of the legal and parliamentary worlds) were the same as those who embraced the \"appelant\" cause in the 18th century.\nSome (mainly among the Jesuits) were convinced of the existence of a Jansenist plot aimed at overthrowing monarchical power. At the beginning of the 20th century, historians such as Louis Madelin and Albert Mathiez refuted this Jansenist conspiracy thesis and emphasised a conjunction of forces and demands as responsible for both the outbreak of the Revolution and the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The theory that the explanation of the Revolution must appeal to several causes, of which Jansenism is only one among others, is now the consensus among historians.\nJansenism outside France.\nThe problem of grace concerned all Roman Catholic countries in the 17th century, and Jansenism, born outside of the Kingdom of France, did not remain confined to France. However, during the early period of Jansenism, that is the 17th century, most of the history of Jansenism took place within the kingdom. It was with the bull \"Unigenitus\" that Jansenism truly expanded outside of France.\nThe Spanish Netherlands\u2014Leuven.\nAs noted by Jonathan Israel Jansenism initially had strong support in the Spanish Netherlands, where Jansen himself had been active, supported by such major figures of the church hierarchy as Jacobus Boon, archbishop of Mechelen and Antonie Triest, bishop of Ghent. Though the Church in the Spanish Netherlands eventually took up the persecution of Jansenism, with Jansenist clergy being replaced by their opponents and the monument to Jansen in the Cathedral of Ypres being symbolically demolished in 1656. Nevertheless the Spanish authorities were less zealous in this persecution than the French.\nThe (Old) University of Leuven, which published \"Augustinus\", remained Augustinian in orientation since the time of Jansen. The popes were less demanding to the university, undoubtedly because they did not have a close political relationship with it as they did with Louis XIV in France. In 1677, a Baianist faction from the theological faculty submitted 116 propositions of moral laxity for censure to Pope Innocent XI. They were textually drawn from the letter of accusation of the professors of Leuven, and thus the Roman authorities suppressed dissertations dealing with the question of the true origin of the propositions, which was regarded as ambiguous. Innocent XI selected 65 propositions from the submission and \"limited himself to condemning the deviations of moral doctrine\",p. 466 avoiding a revival of the controversy on grace. The 65 propositions were described as \"at the very least scandalous and pernicious in practice\", leading the Pope to censure them through a decree of the Inquisition in March 1679,nn. 2101\u20132167 yet \"without naming the probabilism prevalent in Jesuit circles.\" The Holy Office previously censured 45 propositions of moral doctrine between two decrees dated to 24 September 1665, and 18 March 1666. According to Denzinger, the propositions submitted, by both the University of Leuven and the University of Paris, were \"frequently taken out of context and sometimes expanded by elements that are not found in the original, so that most often one must speak of fictitious authors.\"\nUntil the 1690s, it was possible to sign Formula of Pope Alexander VII without specifying one's interpretation of it regarding matters \"de jure\" and \"de facto\". Twice the archbishop of Mechelen, Humbertus Guilielmus de Precipiano, tried to toughen the signing conditions, but he lost a lawsuit against the university. It was not until 1710 that the absolute and unqualified signing of the Formula was made compulsory.\n\"Unigenitus\" was accepted without question from 1715, but the letters \"Pastoralis officii\" of Pope Clement XI provoked fierce conflict between the archbishop of Mechelen and the university. After legal proceedings, episodes of refusal of the sacraments similar to what occurred in France in the 1740s and an exile of professors to the Dutch Republic, the university appeared to submit to the bull and its papal interpretation in 1730.\nThe University of Leuven was, due to its alumni Baius and Jansen, the cradle of Jansenism and remained, during the 17th and 18th centuries until its suppression, the bastion and the hub of Jansenist Augustinian theology in Europe, with professors such as Jansen, Petrus Stockmans, Johannes van Neercassel, Josse Le Plat and especially the famous Zeger Bernhard van Espen and his students Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim or Charles Joseph Mathieu Lambrechts, professor of canon law, rector of the university in 1786, Freemason, and Minister of Justice in the French Directory under Napoleon. As Henri Francotte says, \"Jansenism reigned supreme at the University of Leuven\".\nAs late as 1818, Charles Lambrechts, former rector of the university, ex-senator and minister of Napoleon, recalled the 'vexations' of the Roman Catholic Church against his predecessor van Espen.The encroachments of the Catholic clergy and their pretentions were so vexatious, that, in a time when their religion was dominant, no other remedy had been found for their abuse of power, other than the appeals in question. This is what prompted the famous van Espen to write, at the age of eighty, his treatise \"De recursu ad Principem\", in order to put a barrier up against the ever-resurgent abuses of clerical jurisdictions; but this virtuous clergyman, who distributed to the poor all the income from the chair of canon law which he occupied at the University of Leuven, was soon obliged to resort to appeal for himself as from an abuse; still, this remedy could not entirely save him from persecution by intolerant priests. Burdened with years, glory and infirmities, he was forced to seek in Holland shelter from their vexations; he soon died in Amsterdam amid feelings of piety and resignation, after having spent his life defending the discipline and customs of the Early Church, of which he was the most zealous.\nIn the Dutch Republic.\nThe Dutch Republic was the place of exile for many French Jansenists. They gathered first in Amsterdam, then increasingly in Utrecht. Since the 16th century, this small town had been the seat of the Dutch Mission aimed at the conversion of the Dutch who had become largely Reformed. Jansenist refugees from France and the Spanish Netherlands were made welcome, increasing the Jansenist influence among Dutch Roman Catholics. As a result, the Dutch Mission gained a strong Jansenist element in both theology and morality.650 Politically, the Dutch Jansenists were more inclined than other Roman Catholics to reach accommodation with the Protestant authorities and sought to make themselves independent of papal control. Moreover, theologically the Jansenist doctrines were considered to be closer to the dominant Dutch Reformed Protestantism. Dutch Jansenism (sometimes called 'Quesnelism' after Pasquier Quesnel) was accused by its opponents of being 'crypto-Calvinism within the Church'.653 The controversy between Jansenists and anti-Jansenists (the latter naturally led by the Jesuits) increasingly tore up the Dutch Roman Catholic Church in the late 17th and early 18th century, with the authorities of the Dutch Republic actively involved on the one side and the papacy and kings of France, Spain, Portugal, and Poland on the other. Moreover, some Dutch Roman Catholics seeking greater independence from papal control were identified as being 'Jansenists', even if not necessarily adhering to the theological doctrines of Jansenism.1034\nThe opposition towards the Jesuits and Roman Catholic clergy in general in the Republic of the 1680s prompted a more 'national attitude' among Dutch Roman Catholics, who began to stray from papal authority and adjust to their environment within their local hierarchies.649 The minority status of Roman Catholicism paradoxically allowed greater freedom for the local churches, which elected its bishop and had him confirmed by the pope, even if he only bore the title of 'vicar apostolic' so as not to irritate the government. Relations between Utrecht and French Jansenism had developed early on, since vicar apostolic Johannes van Neercassel, friend of Antoine Arnauld and Pasquier Quesnel, and in 1673 published an 'uncompromisingly Jansenist work', \"Amor Poenitens\", which was frequently criticised by the Jesuits.652 His successor, Petrus Codde, who was influenced by Arnauld and Quesnel, and did much to promote Jansenism in the Dutch Mission including harbouring French Jansenist refugees, was suspended by Clement XI in 1702, despite his popularity with the local population.1034 He appointed a successor who was unpopular with the local Roman Catholics. In August 1702, the States of Holland forbade Dutch Roman Catholics from recognising a vicar general who was not approved by its representatives. This meant that Dutch Roman Catholics were split between submitting to the authority of the Pope at the expense of the States or vice versa.1035\nIn April 1723, tensions culminated when the 'refractory' clergy appointed Cornelius van Steenoven as 'Archbishop of Utrecht', who the majority of the Roman Catholic laity supported, in opposition to papal authority, thus establishing a formal schism between the ultramontane and Jansenist-leaning Roman Catholics.1036 The canons of Utrecht remained without a bishop for almost fifteen years, during which it was ministered mainly by exiled French Jansenists. French bishops also ordained Dutch priests to ensure the survival of this small church.1036\nIn 1724, Utrecht once again had bishops. It was the \"appelant\" Dominique Marie Varlet, coadjutor bishop of the diocese \"in partibus\" of Babylon, who settled in the Dutch Republic after fierce disputes with the Holy See. He agreed to successively ordain four bishops elected by the chapter of Utrecht. This is when the 'Little Church of Utrecht', now called the Old Catholic Church, was founded. With each new ordination of a bishop, the Church sent a request for canonical institution to the pope, who invariably condemned it as a schismatic body. Throughout the 18th century, these two rival Catholic Churches were active in competition. The question of whether, and to what degree, this breakaway church was Jansenist was highly controversial; the Jesuits having a clear polemical interest in emphasising its identification as such.\nThe links between the Old Catholic Church and the French Jansenists are numerous and lasting. From a place of refuge in the 18th century, Utrecht has become a place of conservation of Jansenist history and traditions. There are numerous French Jansenist archives in Utrecht and Amersfoort (where the seminary was located). The funds from the Perrette box were regularly used to partially finance this church. The French Jansenists hoped, until the middle of the 19th century, to have priests ordained by Utrecht to found a church of the same kind in France, although this project never came to fruition.\nItaly.\nThe influence of Jansenism in Italy can be explained with reference to the political fragmentation of the peninsula into numerous states that were traditionally hostile to the papacy. Relations with French Jansenists were established in the 17th century due to contacts established with religious orders, especially Benedictines and Dominicans. The Republic of Venice played an important role in the translation (into Latin or Italian) and dissemination of French Jansenist texts.55 However, Jansenist ideas only had an impact in northern Italy and did not pass south of Rome.\nIn the 18th century, it was the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in particular that were influenced by Jansenism. By its proximity to France, and the fact that it is partly French-speaking, Piedmont constituted an ideal refuge for Jansenists. Thus, Jacques Joseph Duguet took refuge for a time at Tami\u00e9 Abbey, while others found refuge in Chamb\u00e9ry. Joining the opposition to \"Unigenitus\", Victor Amadeus II of Savoy expelled the Jesuits and replaced them with exiled Port-Royalists. In 1761, the bishop of Asti encouraged the priests to take a stand in favour of the Church in Utrecht. The Jansenists in exile therefore had significant influence in this part of Italy.\nIn the Italian territories under Habsburg Austrian domination, the situation was more complex. There, Jansenism encountered Josephinism, which guided Austrian policy at that time. Both systems worked to counter the influence of the pope and the Jesuits by applying the principle of the superiority of the state over religious affairs, which was characteristic of Gallicanism. Jansenism was therefore, in a sense, more moderate religiously but harsher politically, because it was mixed with the Gallican theology of Edmond Richer. In 1761, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria opened a seminary in Vienna in the Port-Royalist spirit, calling on professors from Leuven and Holland, and had as a confessor an influential Jansenist, the Abbot of Terme. He also established the \"Nouvelles eccl\u00e9siastiques\" in Vienna in 1784.\nIn Lombardy, a territory administered directly by Vienna, the theologians Pietro Tamburini, professor of the seminary at Brescia then at the University of Pavia, and Giuseppe Zola propagated the theology of Richer which was deeply imbued with Jansenism. They published works on grace in the same spirit as the Port-Royalist theologians. Their works influenced many clergymen, such as Scipione de' Ricci, bishop of Pistoia and Prato. He was previously vicar general of Florence, where he helped Grand Duke Peter Leopold carry out his religious reforms. De' Ricci was also interested in the \"Convulsionnaires\", and sought to transform his diocese according to his convictions. Thus he introduced into his diocese the \"Catechism of Montpellier\", which was particularly appreciated by Jansenists, distributed to his priests the \"R\u00e9flexions morales\" of Pasquier Quesnel, and finally convened a synod in Pistoia in 1786 to have his Jansenist orientation approved, along with a radical reform of the Latin liturgy. The synod and De' Ricci were firmly disavowed by Rome and he was forced to resign in 1791, while his positions were condemned by the papal bull \"Auctorem fidei\" in 1794.\nThe Republic of Genoa was also affected by Jansenism, where Port-Royalist writings were widely distributed. A Genoese priest, Eustache Degola, made contact with the French Jansenists at the end of the 18th century, and in particular with Henri Gr\u00e9goire. At the time of the Concordat of 1801, he travelled with Gr\u00e9goire throughout Europe and then settled between 1801 and 1810 at Port-Royal-des-Champs. He also had a significant influence upon the Francophile Italian elites. Thus, he converted Countess Manzoni, raised in the Reformed faith, who was the mother of the great Italian poet Alessandro Manzoni, during one of her visits to Paris. The influence of Italian Jansenism upon the founding fathers of the Risorgimento is well-known, since Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, father of Italian unity, and Giuseppe Mazzini, Italian revolutionary, were immersed in the education of Jansenist priests.\nJansenism in the 19th century and beyond.\nThe 19th century was the last century in which Jansenism, real or supposed, was still a force that could count in the Roman Catholic Church. Under this term the spiritual and material descendants of the 17th- and 18th-century Jansenists are amalgamated: those who formed the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Port-Royal\" ('Society of Port-Royal'), and the supporters of Gallicanism who attempted one last time to establish themselves before their disappearance following the First Vatican Council. The debates over grace and the authority of the pope were ended during this council, which proclaimed papal infallibility and established ultramontanism, causing Jansenism to gradually disappear from theological discourse.\nJansenism then became a way of being, a qualifier synonymous with austerity and moral rigour, rather than a theological doctrine. In 1891, L\u00e9on S\u00e9ch\u00e9 described Jansenism and Jansenists in this way.The old quarrel of Jansenism has had its day, and the name 'Jansenist', far from harming those it names, is rather designed to win them esteem and respect. [...] Because there is a Jansenist state of mind, just as there is an Orl\u00e9anist state of mind. It's quite difficult to define, but so it is. [...] In private life, if this man is even the slightest part Jansenist, he will be mysterious and withdrawn, rigid and severe in morals. Simple and straight, sober and hard on his body, he will pass nothing on to others in terms of conduct. Gullible to the point of superstition, he will draw all kinds of horoscopes from the Scriptures and see the finger of God everywhere. In politics, he can be a monarchist as well as a republican, the form of government being, in short, indifferent to him, but he will always be constitutional and liberal. Of religion, he may not practice, nor ever approach the sacraments, but believes himself to be a very good Christian.However, some wars were still being waged against ultramontanism and in defence of the memory of Port-Royal and Jansenism. Thus, newspapers appeared throughout the 19th century, defending the Gallican and Jansenist tradition of the Church in France. After the disappearance of the \"Annales de la religion\" in 1803, Henri Gr\u00e9goire and a few survivors of the Constitutional Church including Claude Debertier published between 1818 and 1821 the \"Chronique religieuse\" ('Religious chronicle'), described by Augustin Gazier as a 'combat magazine'.190 It defended the constitutional priests who refused to submit to the Concordat of 1801 and who were deprived of absolution and sometimes of the sacraments by their bishops (such as Gr\u00e9goire himself). The tone was openly Gallican and defended Jansenism while denying that it was anything other than the traditional doctrine of the Church, \"Jansenism is the doctrine of grace effective in itself, that is to say the necessity, for every good work, of a grace by which God produces in us will and action. Now this is the doctrine of the Church; therefore those who are attached to it are pure and good Catholics.\" The tone was less forceful than in the \"Nouvelles eccl\u00e9siastiques\" or the \"Annales de la religion\".\nA few years later, a defensive journal was reborn, designed with the same principle; the \"Revue eccl\u00e9siastique\" ('Ecclesiastical magazine'). This monthly review appeared from 1838 to 1848. It was designed, financed and distributed by the men of the Parisian Jansenist society grouped within the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Port-Royal\". The organisation was very hierarchical and was based on a core of full members who delegated the writing of articles to provincial correspondants. The \"Revue eccl\u00e9siastique\" became known above all for the harsh debates it had with ultramontane publications. But it always remained within the limit of written debate, despite the widespread practice of pseudonymy for the editors of the articles. The authors based their arguments on their reading of numerous canonical, historical and theological works contained in the Parisian Jansenst libraries. The magazine did not at all approve of the publication of \"Port-Royal\" by Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve.Two reasons have prevented us until now from talking about the work of Mr. Sainte-Beuve. 1) the scant real value of a book in which the author poses as a man of the world and a philosopher to judge the actions, doctrines and feelings of men who are essentially and above all Christians; 2) the extent and difficulty of the work to be done to identify all the errors and blunders into which Mr. Sainte-Beuve must necessarily have fallen by placing himself in the point of view he has chosen.The last magazine intended to defend Jansenism in the 19th century was ('The Catholic Observer'), which appeared from 1855 to 1864. It was first led by the former editors of the \"Revue eccl\u00e9siastique\", and quickly joined by a priest with an assertive character; a defender of Gallicanism and critic of the Jesuits, Wladimir Guett\u00e9e. was a magazine with a strong polemical tone, which detailed in its columns what it considered to be the errors of the Church in France. Its exchanges with \"L'Univers\" of Louis Veuillot were coarse. The magazine also caused a scandal in 1856 by commenting at length and harshly on each of the courses on Port-Royal and Jansenism given to the faculty of theology by the young abbot Charles Lavigerie, until he abandoned his courses after two years.The publication of the magazine ceased in 1861 in the midst of some confusion, when Abb\u00e9 Guett\u00e9e converted to Eastern Orthodoxy.\nDuring the 19th century, Jansenists were part of the abolition societies in France. The Jansenists had criticised Jesuit missions in the New World and advocated for liberation.\nIn \"Dilexit nos\", Pope Francis argued that new forms of Jansenist dualism could still be identified within the life of the Roman Catholic Church:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a baneful Jansenist dualism has re-emerged in new forms. This has gained renewed strength in recent decades, but it is a recrudescence of that Gnosticism which proved so great a spiritual threat in the early centuries of Christianity because it refused to acknowledge the reality of \"the salvation of the flesh\". For this reason, I turn my gaze to the heart of Christ and I\ninvite all of us to renew our devotion to it. I hope this will also appeal to today\u2019s sensitivities and thus help us to confront the dualisms, old and new, to which this devotion offers an effective response.\nAs a stereotype.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Jansenism: we don't know what it is, but it's fashionable to talk about it.\"\nGustave Flaubert, \"Dictionary of Received Ideas\"\nJansenism in the 19th century was also a stance, a qualifier allocated to certain politicians or intellectuals representing moral rigorism and an attachment to Gallican principles. This was how a certain number of politicians of the Bourbon Restoration, the July Monarchy or the French Third Republic were frequently associated with Jansenism, such as Pierre Paul Royer-Collard, Victor Cousin or Jules Armand Dufaure.\nBy the 20th century, the term 'Jansenist' was most often associated with personalities having no other trait in common with the Jansenists of the 17th century than a noticeable moral rigour and austerity. Lionel Jospin was thus described as representing \"Jansenist, demanding, rigorous democracy\", while the bullfighter Jos\u00e9 Tomas was described as \"the Jansenist of the arena, the incorruptible of the \"muleta\"\" by \"T\u00e9l\u00e9rama\". In the 21st century, one researcher has remarked that 'Jansenism' is still commonly used as a pejorative by Catholics, especially in reference to a stereotype of a \"Catholic Calvinism\" with a \"morbid preoccupation with Hell, sexual purity, moral rigor, and clerical authority.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Callaghan is the only person to have held all four Great Offices of State, having also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1964 to 1967, Home Secretary from 1967 to 1970 and Foreign Secretary from 1974 to 1976. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1945 to 1987.\nBorn into a working-class family in Portsmouth, Callaghan left school early and began his career as a tax inspector, before becoming a trade union official in the 1930s. He served as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy during the Second World War. He was elected to Parliament at the 1945 election, and was then regarded as being on the left wing of the Labour Party. He was appointed to the Attlee government as a parliamentary secretary in 1947, and began to move increasingly towards the right wing of the Labour Party, while maintaining his reputation as a \"Keeper of the Cloth Cap\"\u00a0\u2013 that is, seen as maintaining close ties between Labour and the trade unions. Following Labour's defeat at the 1951 election, Callaghan increasingly became regarded as a leader of the right wing of the Labour Party, and stood for the positions of deputy leader in 1960 and for leader in 1963, but was defeated by George Brown for the former and Harold Wilson for the latter.\nFollowing Labour's victory at the 1964 election, Wilson appointed Callaghan as chancellor of the exchequer; this appointment coincided with a turbulent period for the British economy, during which Callaghan had to tackle both a chronic balance of payments deficit and various speculative attacks on the pound sterling, with its exchange rate to other currencies being fixed by the Bretton Woods system. On 18 November 1967, having initially denied that it would do so, the Government devalued the pound sterling. In the wake of the decision, Wilson moved Callaghan to the role of home secretary. During this time, Callaghan was responsible for overseeing the operations of the British Army to support the police in Northern Ireland, following a request from the Northern Ireland government. Callaghan remained in the Shadow Cabinet during Labour's period in Opposition from 1970 to 1974; upon Labour's victory at the 1974 election, Wilson appointed Callaghan as foreign secretary. Callaghan was responsible for renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the European Communities (EC), and strongly supported the successful \"Yes\" vote campaign in the 1975 referendum, which confirmed the UK's membership of the EC.\nWhen Wilson suddenly announced his retirement in March 1976, Callaghan defeated five other candidates to be elected Leader of the Labour Party; he was appointed prime minister on 5 April 1976. Labour had won a narrow majority in the House of Commons at the October 1974 election but, through by-election defeats, had lost this by the time Callaghan became prime minister; and several by-election defeats and defections in his early months of power forced him to strike a confidence and supply agreement with the Liberal Party. This had ended by the time of significant industrial disputes and widespread strikes in the 1978\u201379 \"Winter of Discontent\" \u2013 which, followed by the defeat of the referendum on devolution for Scotland, led to minor parties joining with the Conservative Party to pass a motion of no-confidence in Callaghan on 28 March 1979. Although remaining personally popular in opinion polls, he led Labour to defeat at the 1979 election and was replaced by Conservative Margaret Thatcher. The 1979 defeat marked the beginning of 18 years in opposition for the Labour Party, the longest in its history.\nCallaghan served as Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition until November 1980. He attempted to reform the process by which Labour elected its leader. After leaving the leadership he returned to the backbenches, and between 1983 and 1987 was Father of the House of Commons. On retiring from the Commons in 1987, he was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Callaghan of Cardiff. He died in 2005 at the age of 92, and remains to date the UK's longest-lived former prime minister. He is the most recent prime minister to have served in the British Armed Forces and the only prime minister to have served in the Royal Navy.\nEarly life and career, 1912\u20131945.\nLeonard James Callaghan was born at 38 Funtington Road, Copnor, Portsmouth, England, on 27 March 1912. He took his middle name from his father, James (1877\u20131921), the son of an Irish Catholic father (who had fled to England during the Great Irish Famine) and a Jewish mother. Callaghan's father ran away from home in the 1890s to join the Royal Navy; as he was a year too young to enlist, he gave a false date of birth and changed his surname from Garogher to Callaghan so that his true identity could not be traced. He rose to the rate of Chief Petty Officer.\nHis mother was Charlotte Callaghan (\"n\u00e9e\" Cundy, 1879\u20131961) an English Baptist. As the Catholic Church at the time refused to marry Catholics to members of other denominations, James Callaghan senior abandoned Catholicism and married Charlotte in a Baptist chapel. Their first child was Dorothy Gertrude Callaghan (1904\u201382).\nJames Callaghan senior served in the First World War on board the battleship HMS \"Agincourt\". After he was demobbed in 1919, he joined the Coastguard and the family moved to the town of Brixham in Devon, but he died only two years later of a heart attack in 1921 at the age of 44, leaving the family without an income and forced to rely on charity to survive. Their financial situation was improved in 1924 when the first Labour government was elected, and introduced changes allowing Mrs Callaghan to be granted a widow's pension of ten shillings a week, on the basis that her husband's death was partly due to his war service.\nEarly career.\nIn his early years, Callaghan was known by his first name Leonard. When he entered politics in 1945 he decided to be known by his middle name James, and from then on he was referred to as James or Jim. He attended Portsmouth Northern Secondary School. He gained the Senior Oxford Certificate in 1929, but could not afford entrance to university and instead sat the Civil Service entrance exam. At the age of 17, Callaghan left to work as a clerk for the Inland Revenue at Maidstone in Kent. While working at the Inland Revenue, Callaghan joined the Maidstone branch of the Labour Party and the Association of the Officers of Taxes (AOT), a trade union for this branch of the civil service; within a year of joining he became the office secretary of the union. In 1932 he passed a Civil Service exam that enabled him to become a senior tax officer, and in the same year he became the Kent branch secretary of the AOT. The following year he was elected to the AOT's national executive council. In 1934, he was transferred to Inland Revenue offices in London. Following a merger of unions in 1936, Callaghan was appointed a full-time union official and to the post of assistant secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation (IRSF), and resigned from his Civil Service duties.\nDuring his time working in the Inland Revenue in the early 1930s, Callaghan met his future wife Audrey Moulton, and they were married in July 1938 at Maidstone.\nHis union position at the IRSF brought Callaghan into contact with Harold Laski, the Chairman of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee and an academic at the London School of Economics. Laski encouraged him to stand for Parliament, although later he requested several times that Callaghan study and lecture at the LSE.\nWar service.\nIn 1940, following the outbreak of the Second World War, Callaghan applied to join the Royal Navy, but was initially turned down on the basis that a trade union official was deemed to be a reserved occupation. He was finally allowed to join the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve as an Ordinary Seaman in 1942. While he trained for his promotion, his medical examination revealed that he was suffering from tuberculosis, so he was admitted to the Royal Naval Hospital Haslar in Gosport near Portsmouth. After he recovered, he was discharged and assigned to duties with the Admiralty in Whitehall. He was assigned to the Japanese section, and wrote a service manual for the Royal Navy \"The Enemy: Japan\". He then served in the East Indies Fleet on board the escort carrier HMS \"Activity\", and was promoted to the rank of sub-lieutenant in April 1944. As of 2025, Callaghan remains the last British prime minister to be an armed forces veteran and the only one ever to have served in the Royal Navy.\nWhile on leave from the Navy, Callaghan was selected as a Parliamentary candidate for Cardiff South: he narrowly won the local party ballot with twelve votes, against the next highest candidate George Thomas, who received eleven. Callaghan had been encouraged to put his name forward for the Cardiff South seat by his friend Dai Kneath, a member of the IRSF National executive from Swansea, who was in turn an associate and friend of the local Labour Party secretary, Bill Headon.\nBy 1945, he was serving on in the Indian Ocean. After VE Day, he returned, along with other prospective candidates, to the United Kingdom to stand in the general election.\nAttlee government, 1945\u20131951.\nMember of Parliament.\nThe Labour Party won the overdue general election in a landslide victory on 26 July 1945, bringing Clement Attlee to power, in charge of the first-ever majority Labour government. Callaghan won his Cardiff South seat at the 1945 general election (and would hold a Cardiff-area seat continuously until his retirement in 1987). He defeated the sitting Conservative MP, Sir Arthur Evans, by 17,489 votes to 11,545. He campaigned on such issues as the rapid demobilisation of the armed forces and for a new housing construction programme. He stood on the left wing of the party, and was a vocal critic of the United States in 1945, joining 22 other rebels in voting against accepting the Anglo-American loan. Callaghan did not join the Keep Left group of left-wing Labour MPs, but he did sign a letter in 1947 with 20 other MPs from the group calling for a 'socialist foreign policy' which would create an alternative to the capitalism of the United States and the totalitarianism of the USSR.\nJunior minister.\nIn October 1947, at the age of 35, Callaghan got his first junior ministerial job, when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport under Alfred Barnes. Callaghan was given responsibility for improving road safety, and most notably he persuaded the government to introduce zebra crossings, and to extend the use of cat's eyes on trunk roads. Callaghan did not oppose the government's use of emergency powers to break dockers' strikes in both 1948 and 1949, however, he sympathised with the feelings of ordinary dockers and wrote to Attlee to protest over how the Dock Labour Scheme was operated.\nIn February 1950 he was appointed as Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty. He was a delegate to the Council of Europe, where he supported plans for economic co-operation but resisted plans for a European army. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, Callaghan was given responsibility for deciding how the money allocated to the Royal Navy for rearmament was spent.\nIn opposition, 1951\u20131964.\nAfter Labour lost power in the 1951 general election, Callaghan, who was popular with Labour MPs, was elected to the Shadow Cabinet, and he would serve on the party's front bench for the next 29 years, either in opposition or in government. He was now associated with the Gaitskellite wing of the party on the Labour right, although he avoided joining any faction. He served as the Labour spokesman on Transport (1951\u201353); Fuel and Power (1953\u201355); Colonial Affairs (1956\u201361) and Shadow Chancellor (1961\u201364). He ran unsuccessfully for the Deputy Leadership of the party in 1960. When Hugh Gaitskell died in January 1963, Callaghan ran to succeed him, but came third in the leadership contest, which was won by Harold Wilson.\nWilson government, 1964\u20131970.\nChancellor of the Exchequer, 1964\u20131967.\nIn October 1964, Conservative Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home (who had only been in power for twelve months since the resignation of Harold Macmillan) was forced to call a general election, the parliament being about to expire. Labour won a narrow majority, gaining 56 seats for a total of 317 to the Conservatives' 304. The new Labour government under Harold Wilson immediately faced economic problems; Wilson acted within his first hours to appoint Callaghan as the new chancellor of the Exchequer. Callaghan's time as chancellor was characterised by an ultimately doomed effort to stave off devaluation of the pound. The previous chancellor, Reginald Maudling, had initiated fiscally expansionary measures that had helped create a pre-election economic boom. By greatly increasing domestic demand, this had caused imports to grow much faster than exports; thus, when Labour entered government it faced a balance of payments deficit of \u00a3800,000,000 (), and sterling came under immediate speculative attack. Both Wilson and Callaghan took a strong stance against devaluation of sterling, partly due to the perception that the devaluation carried out by the previous Labour government in 1949 had contributed to that government's downfall. The alternative to devaluation, however, was a series of austerity measures designed to reduce demand in the economy in order to reduce imports, and to stabilise the balance of payments and the value of sterling.\nJust ten days after taking up his post, Callaghan immediately introduced a 15% surcharge on imports, with the exception of foodstuffs and raw materials. This measure was intended to tackle the balance of payments deficit; however, it caused an uproar amongst Britain's international trading partners. The outcry was so intense that it caused the government to announce that the surcharge was a temporary measure. Callaghan later admitted in his autobiography that he could have handled the matter better, and in his haste to tackle the balance of payments problem, had failed to consult foreign governments.\nOn 11 November, Callaghan gave his first budget and announced increases in income tax, petrol tax and the introduction of a new capital gains tax, actions which most economists deemed necessary to take the heat out of the balance and sterling deficit. In line with Labour's manifesto commitments, the budget also contained social measures to increase the state pension and the widows pension; measures which were disliked by the City and speculators, causing a run on the pound. On 23 November, it was decided to increase the bank rate from 2% to 7%, which generated a large amount of criticism. Handling the situation was made more difficult by the attitude of Lord Cromer, the governor of the Bank of England, who argued against the fiscal policies of the new Labour government. When Callaghan and Wilson threatened to call a new general election, the governor soon raised a \u00a33,000,000,000 loan to stabilise the reserves and the deficit.\nHis second budget came on 6 April 1965, in which he announced efforts to deflate the economy and reduce home import demand by \u00a3250,000,000. Shortly afterwards, the bank rate was reduced from 7% down to 6%. For a brief time, the economy and British financial market stabilised, allowing in June for Callaghan to visit the United States and to discuss the state of the British economy with President Lyndon B. Johnson and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nIn July the pound came under extreme pressure, and Callaghan was forced to create harsh temporary measures to demonstrate control of the economy. These included delaying all current government building projects and postponing new pension plans. The alternative was to devalue the pound (or, which would at first have amounted to the same thing, to allow it to float). Callaghan and Wilson, however, were again adamant that a devaluation of the pound would create new social and economic problems and continued to take a firm stance against it. The government continued to struggle both with the economy and with the slender majority which, by 1966, had been reduced to one. On 28 February, Harold Wilson formally announced an election for 31 March 1966. On 1 March, Callaghan gave a 'little budget' to the Commons and announced the historic decision that the UK would adopt decimal currency. (Not until 1971, under a Conservative government, did the United Kingdom move from the system of pounds, shillings and pence to a decimal system of 100 pence to the pound.) He also announced a short-term mortgage scheme which allowed low-wage earners to maintain mortgage schemes in the face of economic difficulties. Soon afterwards, at the 1966 general election, Labour won 363 seats compared to 252 seats against the Conservatives, giving the Labour government an increased majority of 97 seats.\nCallaghan introduced his next Budget on 4 May. He had informed the house that he would bring a full Budget to the House when he made his 'little budget' speech prior to the election. The main point of his budget was the introduction of a Selective Employment Tax, penalising the service industry and favouring the manufacturing industry. Twelve days after the budget, the National Union of Seamen called a national strike and the problems facing Sterling were multiplied. Additional strikes caused the balance of payments deficit to increase. However, a \u00a33,300,000,000 loan from Swiss banks was due by the end of the year. On 14 July the bank rate was increased again to seven percent, and on 20 July Callaghan announced a ten-point emergency package to deal with the crisis which included further tax rises and a six-month freeze on wage increases. By early 1967, the economy had begun to stabilise once again with the balance of payments moving into equilibrium, the bank rate was reduced to 6% in March and 5.5% in May.\nIt was under these conditions that Callaghan beat Michael Foot in a vote to become Treasurer of the Labour Party.\nThe economy was soon in turmoil again by June, with the Six-Day War in the Middle East. Several Arab countries, such as Kuwait and Iraq, announced an oil embargo against Britain, accusing it of intervening on the Israeli side in the conflict, resulting in a rise in oil prices which had a disastrous effect on the balance of payments. Furthermore, the economy was hit in mid-September when a national dock strike lasted for eight weeks. The final straw, however, was an EEC report which suggested that the pound could not be sustained as a reserve currency and it was suggested again that the pound should be devalued. Callaghan responded by pointing out that, had it not been for the Middle East crisis, Britain would have been heading for a balance of payments surplus in 1967. However, rumours that devaluation was on the cards led to heavy selling of Sterling on world markets.\nCallaghan now privately confided in Wilson that he doubted that the pound could be saved; this was reinforced after a meeting with Alec Cairncross, head of the Government Economic Service, who told him in no uncertain terms that the value of Sterling could not be maintained, and in his view it should be devalued as soon as possible. The IMF offered a contingency fund of $3 billion, but Wilson and Callaghan refused this because of several conditions attached, which they believed would allow the IMF to interfere with economic policy. On Wednesday 15 November, the historic decision was taken to commit the government to a 14.3% devaluation from the existing fixed exchange rate of $2.80 to the pound, to $2.40 to the pound. They intended to announce the decision publicly on 18 November. However, in the run-up to the public announcement, Callaghan found himself in a tricky situation when answering questions in the House of Commons: one backbencher, Robert Sheldon, tabled a motion concerning a rumour that Britain would be receiving a loan from banks. Callaghan did not wish to lie to the Commons, but at the same time going public about the devaluation decision before the 18th would be financially disastrous for the country. He answered the initial question by stating that he did not comment on rumours. However, a follow-up question was made by Stan Orme suggesting that devaluation was preferable to deflation, which caused a major problem. Callaghan replied that he had \"nothing to add or subtract from, anything I have said on previous occasions on the subject of devaluation\"... Speculators seized on the fact that he had not denied there would be a devaluation and started selling Sterling. Over the next 24 hours, the flight from Sterling cost the country \u00a31,500 million. The situation was a great political controversy at the time. As Denis Healey in his autobiography notes:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nowadays exchange rates can swing to and fro continually by an amount greater than that, without attracting much attention outside the City columns of the newspapers. It may be difficult to understand how great a political humiliation this devaluation appeared at the time\u2014above all to Wilson and his Chancellor, Jim Callaghan, who felt he must resign over it. Callaghan's personal distress was increased by a careless answer he gave to a backbencher's question two days before the formal devaluation. This cost Britain several hundred million pounds.\nBefore the devaluation, Jim Callaghan had announced publicly to the Press and the House of Commons that he would not devalue, something he later said was necessary to maintain confidence in the pound and avoid creating jitters in the financial markets. Callaghan immediately offered his resignation as chancellor, and increasing political opposition forced Wilson to accept it. Wilson then moved Roy Jenkins, the home secretary, to be chancellor; Callaghan became the new home secretary on 30 November 1967.\nHome secretary, 1967\u20131970.\nCallaghan was responsible for the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968, a controversial piece of legislation prompted by Conservative assertions that an influx of Kenyan Asians would soon inundate the country. It passed through the Commons in a week and placed entry controls on holders of British passports who had \"no substantial connection\" with Britain by setting up a new system. In his memoirs \"Time and Chance\", Callaghan wrote that introducing the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill had been an unwelcome task but that he did not regret it. He said the Asians had \"discovered a loophole\", and he told a BBC interviewer: \"Public opinion in this country was extremely agitated, and the consideration that was in my mind was how we could preserve a proper sense of order in this country and, at the same time, do justice to these people\u00a0\u2013 I had to balance both considerations\". An opponent of the Act, Conservative MP Ian Gilmour, said that it was \"brought in to keep the blacks out. If it had been the case that it was 5,000 white settlers who were coming in, the newspapers and politicians, Callaghan included, who were making all the fuss would have been quite pleased\".\nAlso significant was the passing of the Race Relations Act in the same year, making it illegal to refuse employment, housing or education on the basis of ethnic background. The Act extended the powers of the Race Relations Board at the time, to deal with complaints of discrimination and unfair attitudes. It also set up a new supervisory body, the Community Relations Commission, to promote \"harmonious community relations\". Presenting the Bill to Parliament, Callaghan said: \"The House has rarely faced an issue of greater social significance for our country and our children.\"\nAnother significant development was the Representation of the People Act 1969, which made Britain the first major democratic nation to lower the voting age from 21 to 18. This came into effect in time for the 1970 general election. \nNorthern Ireland.\nCallaghan's tenure as home secretary was marked by the emerging conflict in Northern Ireland: Like all British governments since the partition of Ireland in 1921, Harold Wilson's Labour government preferred not to intervene in the affairs of Northern Ireland. However in August 1969, escalating sectarian violence between the province's Protestant and Catholic communities, gave the Government of Northern Ireland little choice but to ask the British government to intervene directly and send in troops, and it was as home secretary that Callaghan took the decision to deploy British Army troops in the province. In return Callaghan and Wilson demanded that various reforms be implemented in the province, such as the phasing out of the Protestant paramilitary B-Specials, and their replacement by the Ulster Defence Regiment, which was open to Catholic recruits, and various reforms to reduce discrimination against Catholics, such as reforms to the voting franchise, and a reform of local government boundaries and housing allocations. Although the troops were initially welcomed by Northern Ireland's Catholics, by early 1970 this had soured, and the Provisional IRA emerged, and embarked on what became a decades long violent campaign during what became known as The Troubles.\nIn Place of Strife.\nIn 1969, Callaghan, a strong defender of the Labour\u2013trade union link, led the successful opposition in a divided cabinet to Barbara Castle's White Paper \"In Place of Strife\" which sought to modify trade union law. Amongst its numerous proposals were plans to force unions to call a ballot before a strike was held and the establishment of an Industrial Board to enforce settlements in industrial disputes. Ten years later, Callaghan's actions in opposing trade union reform would come back to haunt him during the Winter of Discontent.\nIn opposition, 1970\u20131974.\nWilson's government went on to be unexpectedly defeated by Edward Heath at the 1970 general election.\nCallaghan initially became Shadow Home Secretary, later becoming Shadow Foreign Secretary. In 1973, after an approach from the Conservative Chancellor Anthony Barber he agreed to have his name go forward for the job of Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), however, this was vetoed by the French government.\nWilson government, 1974\u20131976.\nForeign secretary, 1974\u20131976.\nWhen Wilson won the next general election and returned as prime minister in March 1974, he appointed Callaghan as Foreign Secretary.\nIn July 1974 a crisis erupted in Cyprus, when there was a coup d'etat on the island, sponsored by the Greek military junta, which installed the pro-Greek puppet leader Nikos Sampson as the President, who threatened to unify the island with Greece. Turkey responded by launching an invasion of the island to protect the island's Turkish community. Britain was involved in the dispute as a signatory of the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee. Britain sent troops alongside the UN to prevent further advancement of Turkish troops. Callaghan led diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire, and called on both sides to attend tripartite meetings on the crisis with Britain. On 22 July a ceasefire was called. The tripartite talks got underway, and in August an agreement was reached to make the ceasefire permanent, with a buffer zone patrolled by the UN between the Greek and Turkish controlled parts of the island. As of 2025 the island remains partitioned.\nLabour had entered office with the policy of renegotiating the terms of the United Kingdom's membership of the European Community, and then holding a referendum on remaining in the EC on these terms. Callaghan was put in charge of these negotiations. When the talks concluded, Callaghan led the Cabinet in declaring the new terms acceptable and he supported a successful \"Yes\" vote in the 1975 European Community referendum. Callaghan had formerly been on the eurosceptic wing of the Labour Party, however, during the negotiations and referendum he converted to be a pro-European. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of Cardiff on 16 March 1975.\nIn 1975, Callaghan flew out to Uganda in order to bring home the British lecturer Denis Hills, who had been sentenced to death by Uganda's dictator Idi Amin for writing a book critical of him. After an appeal for clemency by both the Queen and the prime minister, Amin agreed to release Hills on the condition that Callaghan appeared in person to take him back to the UK.\nAlso in 1975, Argentina made territorial claims on the Falkland Islands. In response, Callaghan sent HMS \"Endurance\" to the islands, in order to send a message to Argentina that Britain would defend them. Seven years later, in 1982, Callaghan criticised the government of Margaret Thatcher for its decision to withdraw \"Endurance\" from the islands; a decision which contributed to the Argentine invasion that year.\n1976 leadership election.\nBarely two years after beginning his second spell as prime minister, Wilson announced his resignation on 16 March 1976. Although this came as a surprise to most people, Callaghan had been tipped off by Wilson several days in advance. Callaghan was the favourite to win the subsequent leadership election; although he was the oldest candidate, at 64 years old, he was also the most experienced and least divisive, being seen as in the centre ground of the Labour Party. Popularity with all parts of the Labour movement saw him through the ballot of Labour MPs to win the leadership vote. On 5 April 1976, Callaghan became prime minister.\nPrime Minister of the United Kingdom: 1976\u20131979.\nCallaghan was the only prime minister to have held all three leading Cabinet positions\u00a0\u2013 chancellor of the exchequer, home secretary and foreign secretary\u00a0\u2013 prior to becoming prime minister.\nOn becoming prime minister, Callaghan immediately reshuffled the Cabinet: Anthony Crosland was given Callaghan's previous job as foreign secretary, while Merlyn Rees became home secretary, replacing Roy Jenkins who Callaghan nominated to become president of the European Commission. Callaghan removed Barbara Castle, with whom he had a poor relationship, from the Cabinet, and gave her job at social security to David Ennals. \nIMF loan.\nCallaghan came to office at a troubled time for the British economy, which was still recovering from the 1973\u201375 global recession, and was beset by double-digit inflation, and rising unemployment (i.e. stagflation). Within months of entering office, his government was faced with a financial crisis, which caused the Chancellor Denis Healey to ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a large loan of $3900 million to maintain the value of sterling. The IMF demanded large cuts in public spending in return for the loan, which caused consternation among Labour's supporters. The Cabinet was split on the issue, and the left of the party led by Tony Benn put forward an Alternative Economic Strategy as a proposed alternative to the loan, which involved protectionism, but this option was ultimately rejected. After tough negotiations, the government was able to negotiate a reduction in the proposed public spending cuts from \u00a35000 million to \u00a31,500 million in the first year, and then \u00a31000 million a year over the next two years. In the event, it turned out that the loan had not been necessary, as it was based on an overestimation of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement by the Treasury: The government only had to draw on half of the loan, and it was paid back in full by May 1979. By 1978, the economic situation showed signs of improvement, with unemployment falling, and inflation falling to single digits. Healey was able to introduce an expansionary budget in April 1978.\nCallaghan was widely judged to have handled the IMF crisis skilfully, avoiding any resignations from the Cabinet, and negotiating much lower spending cuts than had been originally demanded.\nMinority government.\nCallaghan's time as prime minister was dominated by the troubles in running a government with a minority in the House of Commons: Labour had won a narrow majority of three seats at the October 1974 election, however by April 1976, their overall majority had disappeared, due to by-election losses and the defection of two MPs to the breakaway Scottish Labour Party, which left Callaghan heading a minority government, forced to do deals with smaller parties in order to govern. An arrangement negotiated in March 1977 with Liberal Party leader David Steel, known as the Lib\u2013Lab pact, lasted until August the following year. Deals were then forged with various small parties including the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Welsh nationalist Plaid Cymru, prolonging the life of the government. The nationalist parties, in turn, demanded devolution to their respective constituent countries in return for their supporting the government. When referendums for Scottish and Welsh devolution were held in March 1979 the Welsh devolution referendum saw a large majority vote against, while the Scottish referendum returned a narrow majority in favour, but failed to reach the required threshold of 40% of the electorate in support. When the Labour government duly refused to push ahead with setting up the proposed Scottish Assembly, the SNP withdrew its support for the government: this finally brought the government down as the Conservatives triggered a vote of no confidence in Callaghan's government that was lost by a single vote on 28 March 1979, necessitating a general election.\nPolicies.\nEconomic policies.\nCallaghan's time as prime minister saw broad continuation of the policies which Labour had adopted since it had been elected in 1974 under Wilson. Callaghan continued the policies of the \"social contract\" which sought to control inflation through a voluntary wage restraint agreement with the trade unions. Although the public spending cuts after 1976 made it more difficult for the government to deliver the increased benefits which had been promised as part of the package. Another policy continuation was the National Enterprise Board (NEB) which formed the centrepiece of the government's industrial policy. In practice, the NEB's main activity became one of rescuing failing companies.\nAt the 1976 Labour Party Conference, at the height of the stagflation crisis, Callaghan made the following statement in his speech:\n \"We used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting government spending. I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists, and in so far as it ever did exist, it only worked on each occasion since the war by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy, followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step.\" \nThis has been seen as the repudiation of Keynesian economics, which had formed the bedrock of the post-war consensus, and a precursor to Monetarism, with the fight against inflation being pursued ahead of the aim of full employment, which had been the policy of every post-war government. Although Callaghan was never a full-blown Monetarist, as he had rejected larger cuts in public expenditure which would have resulted in higher unemployment.\nOther policies.\nDespite its lack of Parliamentary majority, Callaghan's government was able to carry out a number of reforms in many areas (see Labour government, 1974\u20131979#Major contributions). Callaghan relied heavily on Michael Foot, who was made Leader of the House of Commons and given the task of steering through the government's legislative programme. Among the measures introduced was the Race Relations Act 1976, which established the Commission for Racial Equality to promote racial equality, increases in pension and benefit rates, the creation of the Police Complaints Board, the expansion of comprehensive education, the establishment of a statutory responsibility to provide housing for the homeless, universal Child Benefit, the phasing out of pay beds in NHS hospitals, housing security for agricultural workers, grants to inner cities, and legislation to improve consumer safety.\nIn February 1977, an easing of the conditions under which unemployment benefit can be paid to people who are unemployed as a result of a trade dispute was carried out. As a result of this change (one that had been recommended by a Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations back in 1968) \u201conly those participating in or directly interested in the trade dispute are disqualified from benefit,\u201d as noted by one study. In August 1977 a new rule was made (Statutory Instrument No 1037/1977 dated the 18th of June 1977) \u201cunder Section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, restricting the circumstances in which a court may remand a person aged under 17 to a Prison Department establishment in England and Wales.\u201d In Scotland, the Community Service by Offenders Act 1978 introduced provisions whereby offenders might, under certain circumstances, be ordered by courts to undertake community work as an alternative to a prison sentence. This legislation brought Scotland in line with England and Wales where similar provisions already apply. The Protection from Eviction Act 1977 \u201cmade it an offence unlawfully to evict (or to attempt to do so) any resident occupant, or to enforce the right to repossession other than through the courts. It laid down restrictions on the validity of notices to quit.\u201d The Rent Act 1977, which applied to England and Wales, \u201claid down the means of fixing rents for controlled or regulated tenancies, and also for tenancies of housing associations or housing trusts.\u201d\nThe Home Purchase Assistance and Housing Corporation Guarantee Act 1978 gave help to first-time home buyers. The Inner Urban Areas Act 1978 allowed local authorities to assist declining industrial areas and central government provided new subsidies to those inner city areas with the most problems, while the 1978 Finance Act introduced profit-sharing schemes. The Consumer Safety Act 1978 protected consumers from purchasing potentially harmful goods, On the 3rd of April 1979 the number of hours that lone parents had to work to qualify for Family Income Supplement was reduced from 30 to 24 per week.\nIn 1977, Callaghan's government also nationalised the shipbuilding industry, creating British Shipbuilders, and the aircraft industry, creating British Aerospace.\nDuring his first year in office, Callaghan started what has since become known as 'The Great Debate', when he spoke at Ruskin College, Oxford, about the 'legitimate concerns' of the public about the quality of education in the nation's maintained schools. This discussion led to greater involvement of the government, through its ministries, in the curriculum and administration of state education, leading to the eventual introduction of the National curriculum some ten years later. In 1977 he caused controversy with the appointment of Peter Jay, his then son-in-law as the British Ambassador to the United States.\nProposed 1978 election.\nOver the summer of 1978, most opinion polls showed Labour with a lead of up to five points, and the expectation grew that Callaghan would call an autumn snap election, which would have given him a second term in office until autumn 1983. The economy had started to improve by this time: 1978 was a year of economic recovery for Britain, with inflation falling to single digits, unemployment declining during the year from a peak of 1.5 million in the third quarter of 1977, to 1.3 million a year later, and general living standards going up by more than 8%. Famously, he strung along the opposition and was expected to make his declaration of election in a broadcast on 7 September 1978. Instead he announced that the election would be delayed until the following year, which was met with almost universal surprise. His decision not to call an election was seen by many as a sign of his dominance of the political scene and he ridiculed his opponents by singing old-time music hall star Vesta Victoria's song \"Waiting at the Church\" at that month's Trades Union Congress meeting. This was celebrated by the TUC but has since been interpreted as a moment of hubris. Callaghan intended to convey the message that he had not promised an election.\nCallaghan's failure to call an election during 1978 was later widely seen as a political miscalculation; indeed, he himself later admitted that not calling an election was an error of judgement. However, private polling by the Labour Party in the autumn of 1978 had shown the two main parties with about the same level of support.\nWinter of Discontent.\nCallaghan's method of dealing with the long-term economic difficulties involved wage restraint, which had been operating for four years with reasonable success. He gambled that a fifth year would further improve the economy and allow him to be re-elected in 1979, and so he attempted to hold pay rises to 5% or less. The trade unions rejected continued wage restraint and in a wave of widespread strikes over the winter of 1978\u201379 (known as the Winter of Discontent) secured higher pay. The industrial unrest made his government unpopular, and Callaghan's response to one interview question only made it worse. Returning to the United Kingdom from the Guadeloupe Conference in January 1979, Callaghan was asked, \"What is your general approach, in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment?\" Callaghan replied, \"Well, that's a judgement that you are making. I promise you that if you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.\" This reply was reported in \"The Sun\" under the headline \"Crisis? What Crisis?\". Callaghan also later admitted in regard to the Winter of Discontent that he had \"let the country down\".\n1979 general election.\nThe Winter of Discontent saw Labour's performance slump dramatically in the opinion polls. They had topped most of the pre-winter opinion polls by several points, but in February 1979 at least one opinion poll was showing the Conservatives 20 points ahead of Labour and it appeared inevitable that Labour would lose the forthcoming election.\nIn the buildup to the election, the \"Daily Mirror\" and \"The Guardian\" supported Labour, while \"The Sun\", the \"Daily Mail\", the \"Daily Express\", and \"The Daily Telegraph\" supported the Conservatives.\nOn 28 March 1979, the House of Commons passed a motion of no-confidence by one vote, 311\u2013310, which forced Callaghan to call a general election which was held on 3 May. The Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher ran a campaign on the slogan \"Labour Isn't Working\". Although Callaghan remained personally more popular with the electorate than Thatcher, the Conservatives won the election with an overall majority of 43 seats. The Labour vote held up, with the party winning a similar number of votes to 1974, however the Conservatives benefited from a surge in turnout.\nDuring the 1979 election campaign, Callaghan detected a sea-change in public opinion, which he privately opined:\n \"You know there are times, perhaps once every thirty years, when there is a sea-change in politics. It then does not matter what you say or what you do. There is a shift in what the public wants and what it approves of. I suspect there is now such a sea change and it is for Mrs Thatcher.\" \nAfter losing power in 1979, Labour spent the next 18 years in opposition, pejoratively described as the period in wilderness for the party.\nLeader of the opposition, 1979\u20131980.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the election defeat, Callaghan wanted to resign as leader, but was persuaded to stay on in the hope that he would provide some stability, and ease the way for Denis Healey to be elected as his successor. During Callaghan's 17-month stint as opposition leader, the Labour Party was torn apart by factional struggles between the left and right of the party. In the event, the left succeeded in electing Michael Foot as his successor following the November 1980 leadership election, and he returned to the backbenches.\nBackbenches and retirement, 1980\u20132005.\nIn 1982, along with his friend Gerald Ford, he co-founded the annual AEI World Forum.\nIn 1983, he attacked Labour's plans to reduce defence, and the same year became Father of the House as the longest continually-serving member of the Commons.\nIn 1987, he was made a Knight Companion of the Garter and stood down at the 1987 general election after 42 years as an MP. He was one of the last remaining MPs elected in the Labour landslide of 1945. Shortly afterwards, he was elevated to the House of Lords on 5 November 1987 as a life peer with the title Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, \"of the City of Cardiff in the County of South Glamorgan\". In 1987, his autobiography, \"Time and Chance\", was published. He also served as a non-executive director of the Bank of Wales.\nHis wife Audrey, a former chairman (1969\u201382) of Great Ormond Street Hospital, spotted a letter to a newspaper which pointed out that the copyright of \"Peter Pan\", which had been assigned by J. M. Barrie to the hospital, was going to expire at the end of that year, 1987 (50 years after Barrie's death, the then-current copyright term). In 1988, Callaghan moved an amendment to the Copyright Designs &amp; Patents Act, then under consideration in the House of Lords, to grant the hospital a right to royalty in perpetuity despite the lapse of copyright, and it was passed by the government.\nDuring the 1980s, Lord Callaghan supported the work of the https:// (JCF), a registered educational charity. He gave the foundation's inaugural memorial lecture in 1981 and took the Chair for a JCF symposium in 1990, being the final event of that ten-year lecture series.\nTony Benn recorded in his diary entry of 3 April 1997 that during the 1997 general election campaign, Callaghan was telephoned by a volunteer at Labour headquarters asking him if he would be willing to become more active in the party. According to Benn:One young woman in her mid-twenties rang up Jim Callaghan and said to him on the phone, \"Have you ever thought of being a bit more active in politics?\" So Callaghan said, \"Well I was a Labour Prime Minister\u00a0\u2013 what more could I do?\"\nDuring an interview broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 programme \"The Human Button\", Callaghan became the only prime minister to go on record with his opinion on ordering a retaliation in the event of a nuclear attack on the United Kingdom:\"If it were to become necessary or vital, it would have meant the deterrent had failed, because the value of the nuclear weapon is frankly only as a deterrent\", he said. \"But if we had got to that point, where it was, I felt, necessary to do it, then I would have done it. I've had terrible doubts, of course, about this. I say to you, if I had lived after having pressed that button, I could never, ever have forgiven myself.\"\nIn October 1999, Callaghan told \"The Oldie Magazine\" that he would not be surprised to be considered as Britain's worst prime minister in 200 years. He also said in this interview that he \"must carry the can\" for the Winter of Discontent.\nOne of his final public appearances came on 29 April 2002, when shortly after his 90th birthday, he sat alongside the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and three other surviving former prime ministers at the time\u00a0\u2013 Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher and John Major at Buckingham Palace for a dinner which formed part of the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, alongside his daughter Margaret, Baroness Jay, who had served as leader of the House of Lords from 1998 until 2001.\nPersonal life.\nCallaghan's interests included rugby (he played lock for Streatham RFC before the Second World War), tennis and agriculture. He married Audrey Elizabeth Moulton, whom he had met when they both worked as Sunday School teachers at the local Baptist church, in July 1938 and had three children\u00a0\u2013 one son and two daughters.\nIn 1968, Callaghan purchased a farm in Ringmer, East Sussex, and in his retirement he and his wife commenced full time farming there.\nAlthough there is much doubt about how much belief Callaghan retained into adult life, the Baptist nonconformist ethic was a profound influence throughout all of his public and private life. It is claimed that Callaghan was an atheist, who lost his belief in God while he was working as a trade union official. His son Michael Callaghan disagrees: \"My father, Jim Callaghan, was brought up as a practising Baptist and as a young man was a Sunday school teacher. As a young man embracing socialism, he had difficulties reconciling his new beliefs with the teachings of his church, but he was persuaded to stay in his Baptist chapel. [...] Incidentally, the title of his autobiography is 'Time and Chance', a quote from Ecclesiastes 9:11.\"\nDeath.\nCallaghan died from lobar pneumonia, cardiac failure and kidney failure, on 26 March 2005. He died just one day before his 93rd birthday and 11 days after his wife of 67 years, who had spent the last four years of her life in a nursing home due to Alzheimer's disease. After her death, Callaghan moved into her former room at the nursing home in Burgess Hill, Sussex, and spent his final days there. He died as Britain's longest-lived former prime minister, having surpassed Harold Macmillan's record 39 days earlier. Callaghan died four months before former prime minister Edward Heath.\nLord Callaghan was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in a flowerbed around the base of the \"Peter Pan\" statue near the entrance of London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, where his wife had formerly been chair of the board of governors.\nHis Order of the Garter Banner was transferred from St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle to Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff following his death.\nHistoriography.\nHis contribution and legacy are still contested. The left-wing of the Labour Party considers him a traitor whose betrayals of true socialism laid the foundations for Thatcherism. They point to his decision in 1976 to allow the IMF to control the government budget. They accuse him of abandoning the traditional Labour commitment to full employment. They blame his rigorous pursuit of a policy of controlling income growth for the Winter of Discontent. Writers on the right of the Labour Party complained that he was a weak leader who was unable to stand up to the left. New Labour writers who admire Tony Blair identify Callaghan with the old-style partisanship that was a dead end, and which a new generation of modernisers had to repudiate.\nPractically all commentators agree that Callaghan made a serious mistake by not calling an election in the autumn of 1978. Bernard Donoughue, a senior official in his government, depicts Callaghan as a strong and efficient administrator who stood heads above [\"sic\"] his predecessor Harold Wilson. The standard scholarly biography by Kenneth O. Morgan is generally favourable\u00a0\u2013 at least for the middle of his premiership\u00a0\u2013 while admitting failures at the beginning, at the end, and in his leadership role following Margaret Thatcher's victory. The treatment found in most textbooks and surveys of the period remains largely negative.\nHistorians Alan Sked and Chris Cook have summarised the general consensus of historians regarding Labour in power in the 1970s:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If Wilson's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callaghan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular \"modus vivendi\" with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country at the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that Mrs Thatcher resoundingly defeated it in 1979.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has written and produced for television, radio, films, novels, theatre and musicals, and has performed as a stand-up comedian and on screen. One of the major figures in the alternative comedy movement of the 1980s, he used a style of left-wing political satire in his early stand-up comedy. \nHe co-wrote the TV sitcoms \"The Young Ones\", \"Blackadder\" and \"Mr. Bean\", and was the sole writer for other sitcoms such as \"Filthy, Rich &amp; Catflap\", \"The Thin Blue Line\" and \"Upstart Crow\". As of 2025, he has published sixteen novels in dystopian, comedy, and crime genres, and an autobiography. He wrote the stage musicals \"The Beautiful Game\" (2000), \"We Will Rock You\" (2002), \"Tonight's the Night\" (2003), and \"Love Never Dies\" (2010).\nEarly life and education.\nBenjamin Charles Elton was born at University College Hospital in Fitzrovia, London, the son of Mary (n\u00e9e Foster), an English teacher from Cheshire, and physicist and educational researcher Lewis Elton. He is a nephew of the historian Sir Geoffrey Elton and a third cousin of singer Olivia Newton-John. Elton's father is from a German-Jewish family and Elton's mother, who was raised in the Church of England, is of British background.\nElton grew up in Catford, South London, before moving with his family to Guildford, Surrey in 1968, where he became involved in amateur dramatics groups. Reflecting on those times at an event in Guildford in 2013, Elton said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I started with the Curtain Raisers in Onslow Village. Yes, we did Peter Pan in 1969 and mum persuaded me to go along to the audition. For me it was literally an Epiphany. My road to Damascus was Friar's Gate. I had an absolute revelation. I loved the theatre and I knew I wanted to be involved in story telling and the public arts. From that moment onwards I was completely hooked.Raised in a loving non-religious home, he is an atheist. Elton studied at Stillness Junior School and Godalming Grammar School in Surrey, before leaving home at age 16 to study theatre at South Warwickshire College in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he took and passed A-levels in English, History and Theatre Studies. In 1977 he went to study drama at the University of Manchester, where he met Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, and in 1980 he graduated with upper second-class honours.\nCareer.\nTelevision.\nUpon university graduation in 1980, Elton joined the BBC and became their youngest ever scriptwriter.\nHis first television appearance came in 1981 as a stand-up performer on the BBC1 youth and music programme \"Oxford Road Show\". His first TV success, at 23, came as co-writer of the television sitcom \"The Young Ones\", in which he occasionally appeared.\nIn 1983/84 he wrote and appeared in Granada Television's sketch show \"Alfresco\", which was also notable for early appearances by Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson and Robbie Coltrane. In 1985, Elton produced his first solo script for the BBC with his comedy-drama series \"Happy Families\", starring Jennifer Saunders and Adrian Edmondson. Elton appeared in the fifth episode as a liberal prison governor. Shortly afterwards, he reunited Rik Mayall and Edmondson with their \"Young Ones\" co-star Nigel Planer for the showbiz send-up sitcom \"Filthy, Rich &amp; Catflap\".\nIn 1985 Elton began his writing partnership with Richard Curtis. Together they wrote \"Blackadder II\", \"Blackadder the Third\", \"Blackadder Goes Forth\", and a failed sitcom pilot for Madness. \"Blackadder\", starring Rowan Atkinson, was a worldwide hit, winning four BAFTAs and an Emmy.\nElton and Curtis were inspired to write \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" upon finding World War I to be apt for a situation comedy. This series, which dealt with greater, darker themes than prior \"Blackadder\" episodes, was praised for Curtis's and Elton's scripts, in particular the final episode. Before writing the series, the pair read about the war and found that: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All the lead up to the first World War was very funny. All the people coming from communities where they'd never bumped into posh people and all being so gung ho and optimistic. The first hundred pages of any book about the world war are hilarious, then of course everybody dies.\nElton and Curtis also wrote Atkinson's 1986 stage show \"The New Revue\", and Mr. Bean's \"exam\" episode.\nElton became a stand-up comedian primarily to showcase his own writing, but became one of Britain's biggest live comedy acts. After a regular slot on \"Saturday Live\" \u2013 later moved and renamed \"Friday Night Live \" \u2013 which was seen as a UK version of the US's \"Saturday Night Live\", he became the host of the programme.\nIn 1990 he starred in his own stand-up comedy and sketch series, \"\", which had a second series in 1994. (The title plays on \"The Man from UNCLE\": \"Auntie\" is a nickname for the BBC.) In 1989 Elton won the Royal Television Society Writers' Award.\nElton wrote and produced \"The Thin Blue Line\", a studio-based sitcom set in a police station, also starring Rowan Atkinson, which ran for two series in 1995 and 1996. A prime-time family show with traditional format and characters, it won the 1995 British Comedy Award and both the public and professional Jury Awards at Reims.\n\"The Ben Elton Show\" (1998) followed a format similar to \"The Man from Auntie\" and featured Ronnie Corbett, a comedian of the old guard that the \"alternative comedians\" of the 1980s were the direct alternative to, as a regular guest. It was Elton's last high-profile network programme in the UK as a stand-up comedian.\nElton wrote the six-part sitcom \"Blessed\", starring Ardal O'Hanlon as a record producer, first broadcast on BBC1 in 2005. No further series was commissioned.\nIn April 2007, \"Get a Grip\", a new show, began on ITV1. Featuring comic sketches similar to those on \"The Ben Elton Show\" and staged studio discussion between Elton and 23-year-old Alexa Chung, the show's aim was to \"contrast Elton's middle-aged viewpoint with Chung's younger perspective\" (although Elton was responsible for the scripts).\nIn 2008, Elton accused the BBC of allowing jokes about vicars but not imams. \"And I believe that part of it is due to the genuine fear that the authorities and the communities have about provoking the radical elements of Islam\".\nOn 10 October 2010, Elton headlined the first episode of \"Dave's One Night Stand\".\nElton worked on \"Ben Elton Live From Planet Earth\", a live one-hour comedy show which debuted on 8 February 2011 on the Nine Network in Australia. Live from Planet Earth was axed by the Nine Network on Wednesday 23 February 2011 after three episodes, despite having six commissioned. The show's final airing rated 200,000 viewers.\nIn 2012, \"The Wright Way\", a new sitcom for BBC1 was commissioned, written and produced by Elton and starring David Haig. Filming for a full six-part series of the sitcom (earlier titled \"Slings and Arrows\") was completed in late February 2013. It debuted in April 2013 to negative reviews.\nIn 2016 Elton wrote the sitcom \"Upstart Crow\", parodying the writing and family life of William Shakespeare, and starring David Mitchell as Shakespeare. This programme ran for a second series in 2017, and a third series in 2018. A Christmas Special was aired on 21 December 2020.\nIn June 2023, Elton presented \"Ben Elton: The Great Railway Disaster\", a Channel 4 documentary about rail privatisation.\nElton returned to live British television on Channel 4 on 21 October 2022 as \"Ringmaster\"/host of a revival of \"Friday Night Live\", celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of Channel 4 and as part of their \"Truth and Dare\" season. On the day of the broadcast, Elton admitted that because of the fluid British political situation, \"I honestly haven't written the first five minutes yet!\"\nRadio.\nElton starred with Adrian Edmondson in a sitcom based on the song \"Teenage Kicks\" for BBC Radio 2. A television version of \"Teenage Kicks\" for ITV has been made; Elton appeared in the pilot but was replaced by Mark Arden when it went to series production.\nFilms.\nElton appeared in amateur dramatic productions as a youth, notably as The Artful Dodger in the musical \"Oliver!\"\nWhile in bit parts in his own TV series, he began professional film acting as CD in \"Stark\", the Australian/BBC TV series adaptation of his novel, in 1993.

He subsequently distanced himself from the party under Tony Blair, although in April 2015, he stated he was \"back with Labour\" for the general election.\nResponding to criticism for writing a musical with Conservative Party supporter Andrew Lloyd Webber, Elton said, \"If I were to refuse to talk to Tories, I would narrow my social and professional scope considerably. If you judge all your relationships on a person's voting intentions, I think you miss out on the varieties of life.\" He added, \"I would have loved a honeymoon period, but I've been irritating journos from the beginning. Originally I was knocked for being too left-wing, and now apparently I've sold out and I'm too right-wing, but all the time I've been being me, and that certainly isn't the person I recognise in anything that's written about me.\" He has denied being anti-establishment. He also said he was a socialist at a time when \"the media was on the whole slavishly worshipping of Thatcher\". He said, \"I believe in the politics of Clement Attlee. I'm a welfare state Labour voter.\"\nElton parodied himself in the sketch \"Benny Elton\" for \"Harry Enfield and Chums\" in 1994, using the style of Benny Hill to send up Elton's \"right on\" socialist image as a politically correct spoilsport, chasing Page 3 models around a park to chastise them and tricking heterosexual couples into becoming homosexual.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Geographically it extends from Strathmore in the east, to the Pass of Drumochter in the north, Rannoch Moor and Ben Lui in the west, and Aberfoyle in the south; it borders the counties of Inverness-shire and Aberdeenshire to the north, Angus to the east, Fife, Kinross-shire, Clackmannanshire, Stirlingshire and Dunbartonshire to the south and Argyllshire to the west.\nPerthshire is known as the \"big county\", or \"the Shire\", due to its roundness and status as the fourth largest historic county in Scotland. It has a wide variety of landscapes, from the rich agricultural straths in the east, to the high mountains of the southern Highlands.\nHistory.\nAdministrative history.\nPerthshire's origins as a shire (the area administered by a sheriff) are obscure, but it seems to have been created during the reign of David I (reigned 1124\u20131153).\nThe Sheriff of Perth had authority over several provinces, including Atholl, Breadalbane, Gowrie, Menteith and Strathearn. Over time, Scotland's shires became more significant than the old provinces, with more administrative functions being given to the sheriffs. In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were established for each shire, which would serve as the main administrative body for the area until the creation of county councils in 1890. Following the Acts of Union in 1707, the English term \"county\" came to be used interchangeably with the older term \"shire\".\nElected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). The burgh of Perth was deemed capable of managing its own affairs and so was excluded from the administrative area of the county council, although the county council still chose to base itself there. Perthshire County Council held its first official meeting on 22 May 1890 at Perth Sheriff Court, then also known as County Buildings, the courthouse (built 1819) which also served as the meeting place for the commissioners.\nThe 1889 Act also led to a review of boundaries, with exclaves being transferred to a county they actually bordered, and parishes which straddled more than one county being adjusted such that each parish was entirely in a single county. There were several such changes affecting the boundaries of Perthshire, notably including the exclaves of Culross and Tulliallan being transferred to Fife.\nReforms in 1930 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 saw the burgh of Perth brought within the administrative area of the county council, and merged the county councils of Perthshire and the neighbouring small county of Kinross-shire for most purposes. The two county councils continued to be elected as separate bodies, but operated together as the \"Perth and Kinross Joint County Council\", serving the combined area of the two counties.\nAs part of the same reforms, the county council took over the functions of the abolished Perthshire Education Authority. The education authority had bought the former County and City Infirmary on York Place in Perth (completed 1838) in 1920 to serve as its headquarters; after 1930 it served as the headquarters of the joint county council, and was renamed County Offices.\nPerthshire was abolished as an administrative area in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. It was split between the Central and Tayside Regions:\nThe two-tier system introduced in 1975 was superseded by a system of unitary authorities in 1996. The districts of Tayside and Central Scotland all became unitary authorities, with Longforgan being transferred from Dundee to Perth and Kinross. The majority of historic Perthshire lies in Perth and Kinross. The exceptions are the southwestern part that is now in the Stirling council area and a few parishes that are now in Clackmannanshire. Perth and Kinross also contains some areas that were not historically in Perthshire, such as Kinross-shire. The lieutenancy areas in the area of historic Perthshire are mostly coterminous with the council areas, the exception being that the Stirling council area forms part of a larger Stirling and Falkirk lieutenancy. The boundaries of the historic county of Perthshire are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.\nCoat of arms.\nThe coat of arms of the County of Perth appears to have been granted for use on the colours and standards of the volunteer and militia units of the county raised at the end of the eighteenth century. The Earl of Kinnoull, a native of Perthshire, and commanding officer of the Perthshire Gentlemen and Yeomanry Cavalry, was also Lord Lyon King of Arms at the time, and he presented the arms to the county in 1800. The grant document was discovered in the Lyon Office in 1890, and forwarded to the newly formed Perth County Council.\nThe shield is very similar to the Scottish royal arms, reflecting that Perthshire was the home county of the House of Dunkeld and contains the former royal capital, Scone. Further royal references are made on the canton, which shows Scone Palace surmounted by the Crown of Scotland. The crest is a Highland soldier, reflecting that the famous Black Watch were formed in the county. The supporters are an eagle and a warhorse, the former from the arms of the city of Perth.\nBurghs.\nBy the 1890s the county contained the following burghs, which were largely outside the county council's jurisdiction:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 divided burghs into two classes from 1930: large burghs, which were to gain extra powers from the county council, and small burghs which lost many of their responsibilities.\nOf the twelve burghs in Perthshire, only Perth was made a large burgh. There were ten small burghs: Blairgowrie and Rattray being united into a single burgh. In 1947 Pitlochry was created a small burgh.\nCivil parishes.\nIn 1894 parish councils were established for the civil parishes, replacing the previous parochial boards. \nThe parish councils were in turn replaced by district councils in 1930.\nFollowing the boundary changes caused by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, the county contained the following civil parishes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDistricts.\nIn 1930 the \"landward\" area of the Local Government councils (the part outside of burgh boundaries) was divided into five districts, replacing the parish councils established in 1894:\nLanguage.\nPerthshire historically straddled the \"Highland line\" separating the English-speaking and Gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland. Until the 19th century it was linguistically divided between the \"mountainous, sparsely-populated and largely Gaelic-speaking parishes to the north and west and predominantly arable, densely-settled, and chiefly English-speaking parishes to the south and east\".\nLinguistic data for Perthshire is limited before the 17th century. Based on James Kirkwood's assessment of Highland parishes for his Scottish Gaelic Bible project, it has been estimated that around 45 percent of Perthshire spoke Gaelic in 1698. The decline in the use of Gaelic accelerated rapidly in the early 19th century. In the 1881 United Kingdom census, the first to count Scottish Gaelic speakers, Gaelic was recorded as spoken \"habitually\" by 12.1 percent of Perthshire residents. This had declined to 1.7 percent by the 1971 census.\nPerthshire Gaelic has existed as a distinct dialect since at least the 16th century, when the \"Book of the Dean of Lismore\" was published. Lady Evelyn Stewart Murray compiled Perthshire Gaelic folk tales and songs in the late 19th century, a collection now held by the School of Scottish Studies. Alexandra Stewart of Glen Lyon, a reputed direct descendant of Allan Breck Stewart was obituarised in 1991 as the \"last surviving native speaker of Perthshire Gaelic\", although this status was uncertain. In the 20th century, a revival of Scottish Gaelic in Perthshire was led by Elizabeth McDiarmid.\nGeography.\nThe county forms part of the Highland geographic area; it consists of predominantly mountainous and hilly land within the Grampian Mountains, interspersed with numerous lochs and glens. The highest point is Ben Lawers at 1,214\u00a0m (3,983\u00a0ft), making it the 10th highest peak in Scotland. Most towns are fairly small, with the larger ones being clustered in the flatter south-east of the county. In the far south along the borders with Clackmannanshhire and Kinross-shire lie the Ochil Hills, and in the south-east part of the Sidlaw Hills lie within the county, continuing on into Angus. Perthshire borders the Firth of Tay in the south-east, which provides access to the North Sea; along the north shore lies the Carse of Gowrie, an extremely flat area of land given over to agriculture. Within the Forth can be found the small island of Mugdrum.\nLochs and Reservoirs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGlens and straths.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSettlements.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTransport.\nThe Highland Main Line railway line connects Perth to Inverness, and in the far west the West Highland Line criss-crosses the Perthshire-Argyllshire boundary. Other lines in the south-east link Perth to the towns of Fife and Stirlingshire.\nParliamentary constituencies.\nFollowing the Act of Union, Perthshire returned members to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1708.\n1885\u20131918.\nIn 1885 seats in the House of Commons were redistributed: Perthshire received three seats.\n1918\u20131975.\nIn 1918 there was a further redistribution. Perthshire was combined with Kinross-shire to form a parliamentary county, divided into two constituencies:\nThese boundaries continued in use until 1983, when new constituencies were formed based on the Local Government regions and districts created in 1975.\n1975\u20132005.\nPerthshire was represented in House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1975 to 2005.\n2005-2024.\nPerthshire had two constituencies and two Members of Parliament.\n2024-present.\nPerthshire is now represented by the parliamentary constituencies of: \nNotable places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSchools.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52281", "revid": "45925219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52281", "title": "Clackmannanshire", "text": "Historic county and council area of Scotland\nClackmannanshire (; ; ), or the County of Clackmannan, is a historic county, council area, registration county and lieutenancy area in Scotland, bordering the council areas of Stirling, Fife, and Perth and Kinross. To the south, it is separated from Falkirk by the Firth of Forth. In terms of historic counties it borders Perthshire, Stirlingshire and Fife.\nThe name consists of elements from three languages. The first element is from meaning \"Stone\". Mannan is a derivative of the Brythonic name of the Manaw, the Iron Age tribe who inhabited the area. The final element is the English word shire. As Britain's smallest historic county, it is often nicknamed \"The Wee County\". When written, Clackmannanshire is commonly abbreviated to Clacks.\nHistory.\nClackmannanshire takes its name from the original county town of Clackmannan, which is named after a stone anciently associated with the pre-Christian deity Manau or Mannan. The stone now rests on a larger stone beside the surviving tower of Clackmannan Tolbooth and the Mercat Cross at the top of Main street, Clackmannan.\nClackmannanshire became known for the weaving mills powered by the Hillfoots burns. Other industries included brewing, glass manufacture, mining and ship building. Now capitalising on its central position and transport links, Clackmannanshire attracts service industries and tourism.\nThe motto of Clackmannanshire is \"Look Aboot Ye\" (\"Circumspice\" in Latin). In 2007 a re-branding exercise led to the area adopting the slogan \"More Than You Imagine\".\nAdministrative history.\nClackmannanshire's origins as a shire (the area controlled by a sheriff) are unclear; it had certainly become a shire by 1305, with some suggestion that it may have already existed in the early 1200s.\nThe county town was originally Clackmannan, where the tolbooth was built in 1592 to serve as the sheriff court for the county. Commissioners of Supply were established in 1667 to act as the main administrative body for the shire. In 1822 the sheriff court and meeting place of the commissioners was moved from Clackmannan to Alloa, which had grown to become the more significant town. County Buildings was built in 1865 at the corner of Mar Street and Drysdale Street in Alloa to serve as the courthouse and meeting place for the commissioners.\nElected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). Clackmannanshire County Council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the County Buildings in Alloa, which would serve as the county council's headquarters until its abolition in 1975.\nThe 1889 act also led to a review of boundaries, with several exclaves being transferred to a county they actually bordered, and parishes which straddled more than one county being adjusted such that each parish was entirely in a single county. These changes saw Clackmannanshire cede Cambuskenneth to Stirlingshire, whilst it gained Alva from Stirlingshire and parts of Alloa parish which had been in Perthshire.\nClackmannanshire County Council was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced Scotland's counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier structure of upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Clackmannanshire became part of the Central region and a Clackmannan district was created covering the pre-1975 county plus the parish of Muckhart, which had been in Perthshire prior to 1975.\nFurther local government reforms in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 saw the regions and districts created in 1975 abolished and replaced with council areas providing all local government services. Clackmannan district became one of the new council areas, taking on the functions of the abolished Central Regional Council. The 1994 act originally named the new council area \"Clackmannan\", but the shadow authority elected in 1995 requested a change of name to \"Clackmannanshire\", which was agreed by the government before the new council area came into force on 1 April 1996.\nGovernance.\nPolitical control.\nThe council has been under no overall control since 2007. It has been run by a Scottish National Party minority administration since 2017.\nThe first election to Clackmannan District Council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 16 May 1975. A shadow authority was again elected in 1995 ahead of the change to council areas which came into force on 1 April 1996. Political control since 1975 has been as follows:\nLeadership.\nThe role of convener is largely ceremonial in Clackmannanshire. They chair full council meetings and act as the council's civic figurehead. Political leadership is provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1996 have been:\nComposition.\nFollowing the 2022 election and a subsequent change of allegiance in December 2022, the composition of the council was:\nThe next election is due in 2027.\nPremises.\nSince 2014, the council has been based at Kilncraigs, on Greenside Street in Alloa.\nAfter the 1975 local government reorganisation, the old meeting place of Clackmannanshire County Council at the County Buildings reverted to being solely a courthouse, and the old county council's offices in converted houses along nearby Marshill passed to the Central Regional Council. Clackmannan District Council acquired a modern office building called The Whins on Whins Road to serve as its headquarters, and also took over the former Alloa Town Council building at Greenfield House on Mar Place.\nGreenfield House had been built as a house in 1894 and had been bought by the old town council in 1952, with its gardens becoming a public park. In 1987 Greenfield House was extended, allowing it to become the district council's headquarters, with The Whins subsequently being turned into the Alloa Business Centre. Greenfield House then served as the council's headquarters until 2014.\nIn 2014 the council moved to Kilncraigs, which had been built in 1904 as the offices, factory and warehouse of John Paton, Son and Co, manufacturers of knitting yarn. After the factory closed the whole building had been converted to offices in 2004.\nElections.\nSince 2007 elections have been held every five years under the single transferable vote system, introduced by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004. Election results since 1995 have been as follows:\nWards.\nSince 2007, the council area has been divided into five multi-member wards:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCommunities.\nThe council area is divided into nine community council areas, eight of which have community councils as at 2023, being those marked with an asterisk below.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTown twinning.\nSince 2006, Clackmannanshire has been twinned with Vendargues, in southern France, and with Espartinas, in Andalusia, Spain.\nCoat of arms.\nClackmannanshire's coat of arms is blazoned:\n\"Or, a saltire gules; upon a chief vert, between two gauntlets proper, a pale argent charged with a pallet sable.\"\nThe red saltire on gold is taken from the arms of the Clan Bruce. According to legend, Robert Bruce mislaid his gauntlets while visiting the county, and upon asking where he could find them was told to \"look aboot ye\" (hence the motto). The green chief represents the county's agriculture, while the black and white pale is taken from the arms of the Clan Erskine whose chief the Earl of Mar lives at Alloa Tower. Sir Thomas Bruce 1st Baron of Clackmannan was a member of the House of Bruce and received lands in Clackmannan from his cousin Robert II.\nWider politics.\nIn the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Clackmannanshire was the first council area to declare its result. Though some predictions had seen the area as being favourable towards the \"Yes\" side, the \"No\" vote took 53.8% of the area's vote. This was seen as an early sign that Scotland would vote against independence.\nIn the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Clackmannanshire voted by 58% to remain.\nDemographics.\nLanguages.\nThe 2022 Scottish Census reported that out of 50,401 residents aged three and over, 18,802 (37.3%) considered themselves able to speak or read the Scots language. This puts Clackmannanshire as the council area with the ninth highest proficiency in Scots.\nThe 2022 Scottish Census reported that out of 50,402 residents aged three and over, 520 (1%) considered themselves able to speak or read Gaelic. \nGeography.\nIn terms of population, Clackmannanshire is the smallest council area in mainland Scotland. Its population was 52,110 in 2024, around half of whom live in the main town and administrative centre, Alloa.\nThe Ochil Hills dominate the northern third of the county, where Ben Cleuch, Clackmannanshire's highest point, can be found. The northernmost salient of the county lies along the Upper Glendevon Reservoir. Strathdevon is immediately to the south of the steep escarpment formed by the Ochil Fault, along which the Hillfoots Villages are located. Strathdevon mostly comprises a lowland plain a few hundred metres either side of the River Devon, which joins the Forth near Cambus. There is also the Black Devon river that flows past the town of Clackmannan to join the Forth near Alloa. This confluence once had a small pier, for portage to Dunmore pier on the south shore, and anchorage of smaller sailing ships, while others of greater tonnage could be accepted at Dunmore pier on the opposite banks of the Forth. Roughly in the centre of the county lies the Gartmorn Dam County Park, and there are small patches of forest in the south-east of the county. Two unnamed peninsulas are formed by meanders in the river Forth along Clackmannanshire's southern boundary; the easternmost of these has two small islands - Tullibody Inch and Alloa Inch - either side of it.\nEconomy.\nThe main industries are agriculture, brewing, and formerly coal mining. In 2006, permission was given for a waterfront development of the Docks area of Alloa, which has been in decline since the 1960s. There is a large glass works at Alloa.\nTransport.\nAlloa railway station reopened in May 2008; prior to this the county had no active railway stations. A new railway line was completed which connected Kincardine and Stirling, and thus reconnecting Alloa to the national rail network for the first time since 1968, was opened to the public. Scheduled passenger services operate only between Alloa and Stirling and onwards to Glasgow and Edinburgh; the line to Kincardine is normally used by freight trains only but some special excursion trains are run by charter operators. An opening ceremony was held on Thursday 15 May 2008, with the first fully functioning passenger service commencing in the new summer timetable on 19 May 2008. The service provides an hourly connection between Alloa, Stirling and Glasgow Queen Street.\nThe Clackmannanshire Bridge, a new road crossing of the Forth intended to ease congestion and pressure on the older Kincardine Bridge, opened in 2008 (technically the span of the new bridge is not within the county, instead falling just outside it and administratively divided between Falkirk and Fife).\nMajor roads in the area are the A91 between Bannockburn and St Andrews which is the main thoroughfare through the Hillfoots Villages, the A907 between Stirling and Dunfermline which passes through Alloa and Clackmannan, the A908 connecting Alloa and Tillicountry, and the A977 (fed by the A876) between Kincardine and Kinross which runs east of Clackmannan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He also served earlier in the British Army during the Seven Years War. He sold his commission after the Seven Years War and served for a time in the Polish army of King Stanislaus II Augustus.\nLee moved to North America in 1773 and bought an estate in western Virginia. When the fighting broke out in the American Revolutionary War in 1775, he volunteered to serve with rebel forces. Lee's ambitions to become Commander in Chief of the Continental Army were thwarted by the appointment of George Washington to that post.\nIn 1776, forces under his command repulsed a British attempt to capture Charleston, which boosted his standing with the army and Congress. Later that year, he was captured by British cavalry under Banastre Tarleton; he was held by the British as a prisoner until exchanged in 1778. During the Battle of Monmouth later that year, Lee led an assault on the British that miscarried. He was subsequently court-martialed and his military service brought to an end. He died in Philadelphia in 1782.\nEarly and personal life.\nLee was born on 6 February 1732 [O.S. 26 January 1731] in Darnhall, Cheshire, England, Great Britain, the son of Major General John Lee and his wife Isabella Bunbury (daughter of Sir Henry Bunbury, 3rd Baronet). His mother's family were landed gentry with national stature\u2014his maternal grandfather had been an MP for Cheshire, and a cousin, Sir Thomas Charles Bunbury, was an MP for Suffolk. Five of Lee's six older siblings had died \u2013 only his sister Sidney Lee, four years older, survived to adulthood. Sidney never married.\nLike his mother, with whom he did not get along well, Lee would have a temperamental personality and poor physical health (suffering rheumatism and chronic attacks of gout), which caused him to travel often to medicinal spas. He received a private education from tutors, then was sent to a grammar school near Chester and a private academy in Switzerland before being sent to King Edward VI School, Bury St Edmunds, a free grammar school near the home of his uncle, Rev. William Bunbury. Lee became proficient in several languages, including Latin, Greek, and French. His father was colonel of the 55th Foot (later renumbered the 44th) when he purchased a commission on 9 April 1747, for Charles as an ensign in the same regiment.\nDespite inheriting money upon his mother's death, Lee became known for a peripatetic and extravagant lifestyle, which led to financial difficulties several times in his life, including after liquidating land grants in East Florida and Prince Edward Island in the late 1760s (which he received because of his service in the French and Indian War). By 1770, Lee had acquired the services of Giuseppe Minghini, who would remain his servant until the end of his life and received a bequest. Lee owned at least six slaves shortly before his death, and his will divided ownership of all his slaves (three mentioned by name) between Minghini and Elizabeth Dunne, Lee's housekeeper. After paying his debts and a number of specific bequests, some involving horses and others money (usually to purchase mourning rings), Lee directed his executors (future congressman Alexander White and former Rev. Charles Mynn Thurston), to pay the remainder of his estate (worth about $700 according to the filed inventory) to his sister Sidney.\nSeven Years' War and after.\nNorth America.\nAfter completing his schooling, Lee reported for duty with his regiment in Ireland. Shortly after his father's death, on 2 May 1751, he received (or purchased) a lieutenant's commission in the 44th. He was sent with the regiment to North America in 1754 for service in the French and Indian War under Major General Edward Braddock, in what was a front for the Seven Years War between Britain and France. He was with Braddock at his defeat at the Battle of the Monongahela in 1755. During this time in America, Lee married the daughter of a Mohawk \nchief. His wife (name unknown) gave birth to twins. Lee was known to the Mohawk, who were allies of the English, as \"Ounewaterika\" or \"Boiling Water\".\nOn 11 June 1756, Lee purchased a Captain's commission in the 44th for the sum of \u00a3900. The following year he took part in an expedition against the French fortress of Louisbourg, and on 1 July 1758, he was wounded in a failed assault on Fort Ticonderoga. He was sent to Long Island to recuperate. A surgeon whom he had earlier rebuked and thrashed attacked him. After recovering, Lee took part in the capture of Fort Niagara in 1759 and Montreal in 1760. This brought the war in the North American theater to an end by completing the Conquest of Canada.\nPortugal.\nLee went back to Europe, transferred to the 103rd Foot as a major, and served as a lieutenant colonel in the Portuguese army. He fought against the Spanish during their unsuccessful invasion of the country, and distinguished himself under John Burgoyne at the Battle of Vila Velha.\nPoland.\nLee returned to England in 1763 following the Peace of Paris, which ended the Seven Years' War. His regiment was disbanded and he was retired on half pay as a major. On 26 May 1772, although still inactive, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.\nIn 1765, Lee served as an aide-de-camp under Stanislaus II, King of Poland. After many adventures he came home to England. Unable to secure promotion in the British Army, in 1769 he returned to Poland and then saw action in the Russo-Turkish War. In a duel in Italy, he lost two fingers, but in a second duel with the same Italian officer, he killed his opponent.\nReturn to England and North America.\nReturning to England again, he found that he was sympathetic to the North American colonists in their quarrel with Great Britain. He moved to the colonies in 1773 and in 1775 purchased an estate worth \u00a33,000 in Berkeley County, near the home of his friend Horatio Gates, with whom he had served in the French and Indian War and who had moved back to the colony in 1772. This area is now part of West Virginia. He spent ten months travelling through the colonies and acquainting himself with patriots.\nAmerican Revolution.\nContinental Army.\nAlthough Lee was generally acknowledged at the Second Continental Congress to be the most capable candidate for the command of the Continental Army, the role was given to George Washington. Lee recognized the sense of giving the position to a native-born North American, but expected to be given the role of second-in-command. He was disappointed when that role went to Artemas Ward, whom Lee considered too inexperienced for the job. Lee was appointed major-general and third in line, but succeeded to second-in-command in 1776 when Ward resigned due to ill health.\nSouthern command.\nLee also received various other titles: in 1776, he was named commander of the so-called Canadian Department, although he never got to serve in this capacity. He was appointed as the first commander of the Southern Department. He served in this post for six months, until he was recalled to the main army. During his time in the South, the British sent an expedition under Henry Clinton to recover Charleston, South Carolina. Lee oversaw the fortification of the city. Fort Sullivan was a fortification built out of palmetto logs, later named for commander Col. William Moultrie. Lee ordered the army to evacuate the fort because as he said it would only last thirty minutes and all soldiers would be killed. Governor John Rutledge forbade Moultrie to evacuate and the fort held. The spongy palmetto logs repelled the cannonball from the British ships. The assault on Sullivan's Island was driven off, and Clinton abandoned his attempts to capture the city. Lee was acclaimed as the \"hero of Charleston\", although according to some American accounts the credit for the defense was not his.\nNew York and capture.\nThe British capture of Fort Washington and its near 3,000-strong garrison on 16 November 1776, prompted Lee's first overt criticism of Washington. Believing the commander-in-chief's hesitation to evacuate the fort to be responsible for the loss, Lee wrote to Joseph Reed lamenting Washington's indecision, a criticism Washington read when he opened the letter believing it to be official business. As Washington retreated across New Jersey after the defeat at New York, he urged Lee, whose troops were north of New York, to join him. Although Lee's orders were at first discretionary, and although there were good tactical reasons for delaying, his slow progress has been characterized as insubordinate. On 12 December 1776, Lee was captured by British troops at White's Tavern in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, while writing a letter to General Horatio Gates complaining about Washington's deficiency.\nBattle of Monmouth.\nLee was released on parole as part of a prisoner exchange in early April 1778 and, while on his way to York, Pennsylvania, was greeted enthusiastically by Washington at Valley Forge. Lee was ignorant of the changes that had occurred during his sixteen-month captivity; he was not aware of what Washington believed to be a conspiracy to install Gates as commander-in-chief or of the reformation of the Continental Army under the tutelage of Baron von Steuben. According to Elias Boudinot, the commissary who had negotiated the prisoner exchange, Lee claimed that \"he found the Army in a worse situation than he expected and that General Washington was not fit to command a sergeant's guard.\" While in York, Lee lobbied Congress for promotion to lieutenant general, and went above Washington's head to submit to it a plan for reorganizing the army in a way that was markedly different from that which Washington had worked long to implement.\nLee's suggestion was for a militia army that avoided competing with a professional enemy in a pitched battle and relied instead on a defensive strategy which would wear down an opposing army with harassing, small-unit actions. After completing his parole, Lee returned to duty with the Continental Army as Washington's second-in-command on 21 May. In June, as the British evacuated Philadelphia and marched through New Jersey en route to New York, Washington twice convened war councils to discuss the best course of action. In both, his generals largely agreed that Washington should avoid a major battle, Lee arguing that such a battle would be criminal, though a minority favored a limited engagement. At the second council, Lee argued the Continental Army was no match for the British Army, and favored allowing the British to proceed unimpeded and waiting until French military intervention following the Franco-American alliance could shift the balance in favor of the Americans.\nWashington agreed with the minority of his generals who favored an aggressive but limited action. He allocated some 4,500 troops, approximately a third of his army, to a vanguard that could land a heavy blow on the British without risking his army in a general engagement. The main body would follow and provide support if circumstances warranted. He offered Lee command of the vanguard, but Lee turned the job down on the basis that the force was too small for a man of his rank and position. Washington gave the position to Major General the Marquis de Lafayette. In his haste to catch the British, Lafayette pushed the vanguard to exhaustion and outran his supplies, prompting Washington to send Lee, who had in the meantime changed his mind, to replace him.\nLee took over on 27 June at Englishtown. The British were at Monmouth Courthouse (modern-day Freehold), from Englishtown. Washington was with the main body of just over 7,800 troops and the bulk of the artillery at Manalapan Bridge, behind Lee. Believing action to be imminent, Washington conferred with the vanguard's senior officers at Englishtown that afternoon but did not offer a battle plan. Lee believed he had full discretion on whether and how to attack and called his own war council after Washington left. He intended to advance as soon as he knew the British were on the move, in the hope of catching their rearguard when it was most vulnerable. In the absence of any intelligence about British intentions or the terrain, Lee believed it would be useless to form a precise plan of his own.\nLee's battle.\nWhen news arrived at 05:00 on 28 June that the British were moving, Lee led the vanguard towards Monmouth Court House, where he discovered the British rearguard, which he estimated at 2,000 troops. He ordered Brigadier General Anthony Wayne with some 550 men to fix the rearguard in place while he led the remainder of the vanguard on a left hook with the intention of outflanking the British, but he neglected to inform his subordinates, Brigadier General Charles Scott and Brigadier General William Maxwell, of his plan. Lee's confidence crept into reports back to Washington that implied \"the certainty of success.\"\nAs soon as the British commander, General Sir Henry Clinton, received news that his rearguard was being probed, he ordered his main combat division to march back towards Monmouth Court House. Lee became concerned that his right flank would be vulnerable and moved with Lafayette's detachment to secure it. To his left, Scott and Maxwell were not in communication with Lee and not privy to his plan. They became concerned that the arriving British troops would isolate them, and decided to withdraw. To their left, Wayne's isolated troops, having witnessed the British marching back, were also withdrawing. Lee witnessed one of Lafayette's units pulling back after a failed attempt to silence some British artillery around the same time as one of his staff officers returned with the news that Scott had withdrawn. With his troops withdrawing without orders, it became clear to Lee that he was losing control of the vanguard, and with his immediate command now only 2,500 strong, he realized his plan to envelop the British rearguard was finished. His priority became the safety of his troops in the face of superior numbers, and he ordered a general retreat.\nLee had significant difficulties communicating with his subordinates and could exercise only limited command and control of the vanguard, but at unit level, the retreat was generally conducted with a discipline that did credit to Steuben's training, and the Americans suffered few casualties. Lee believed he had conducted a model \"retrograde manoeuver in the face and under fire of an enemy\" and claimed his troops moved with \"order and precision.\" He had remained calm during the retreat but began to unravel at Ker's house. When two of General Washington's aides informed Lee that the main body was still some away and asked him what to report back, Lee replied \"that he really did not know what to say.\" Crucially, he failed to keep Washington informed of the retreat.\nWithout any recent news from Lee, Washington had no reason to be concerned as he approached the battlefield with the main body shortly after midday. In the space of some ten minutes, his confidence gave way to alarm as he encountered a straggler bearing the first news of Lee's retreat and then whole units in retreat. None of the officers Washington met could tell him where they were supposed to be going or what they were supposed to be doing. As the commander-in-chief rode on ahead, he saw the vanguard in full retreat but no sign of the British. At around 12:45, Washington found Lee marshalling the last of his command across the middle morass, marshy ground southeast of a bridge over the Spotswood Middle Brook.\nExpecting praise for a retreat he believed had been generally conducted in good order, Lee was uncharacteristically lost for words when Washington asked without pleasantries, \"I desire to know, sir, what is the reason\u00a0\u2013 whence arises this disorder and confusion?\" When he regained his composure, Lee attempted to explain his actions. He blamed faulty intelligence and his officers, especially Scott, for pulling back without orders, leaving him no choice but to retreat in the face of a superior force, and reminded Washington that he had opposed the attack in the first place. Washington was not convinced; \"All this may be very true, sir,\" he replied, \"but you ought not to have undertaken it unless you intended to go through with it.\" Washington made it clear he was disappointed with Lee and rode off to organize the battle he felt his subordinate should have given. Lee followed at a distance, bewildered and believing he had been relieved of command.\nWith the main body still arriving and the British no more than away, Washington began to rally the vanguard to set up the very defenses Lee had been attempting to organize. He then offered Lee a choice: remain and command the rearguard, or fall back across the bridge and organize the main defenses on Perrine's Hill. Lee opted for the former while Washington departed to take care of the latter. Lee fought the counter-attacking British in a rearguard action that lasted no more than thirty minutes, enough time for Washington to complete the deployment of the main body, and at 13:30, he was one of the last American officers to withdraw across the bridge. When Lee reached Perrine's Hill, Washington sent him with part of the former vanguard to form a reserve at Englishtown. At 15:00, Steuben arrived at Englishtown and relieved Lee of command.\nGeneral Lee regarded John Skey Eustace as his adopted son and declared him as his heir, but Eustace decided to desert the unpredictable Lee.\nCourt martial.\nEven before the day was out, Lee was cast in the role of villain, and his vilification became an integral part of after-battle reports written by Washington's officers. Lee continued in his post as second-in-command immediately after the battle, and it is likely that the issue would have simply subsided if he had let it go. On 30 June, after protesting his innocence to all who would listen, Lee wrote an insolent letter to Washington in which he blamed \"dirty earwigs\" for turning Washington against him, claimed his decision to retreat had saved the day, and pronounced Washington to be \"guilty of an act of cruel injustice\" towards him. Instead of the apology Lee was tactlessly seeking, Washington replied that the tone of Lee's letter was \"highly improper\" and that he would initiate an official inquiry into Lee's conduct. Lee's response demanding a court martial was again insolent, and Washington ordered his arrest and set about obliging him.\nThe court convened on 4 July 1778, and three charges were laid before Lee: disobeying orders in not attacking on the morning of the battle, contrary to \"repeated instructions;\" conducting an \"unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat;\" and disrespect towards the commander-in-chief. The trial concluded on 12 August 1778, and the accusations and counter-accusations continued to fly until the verdict was confirmed by Congress on 5 December 1778. Lee's defense was articulate but fatally flawed by his efforts to turn it into a personality contest between himself and Washington. He denigrated the commander-in-chief's role in the battle, calling Washington's official account \"from beginning to end a most abominable, damn'd lie,\" and disingenuously cast his own decision to retreat as a \"masterful maneuver\" designed to lure the British onto the main body. Washington remained aloof from the controversy, but his allies portrayed Lee as a traitor who had allowed the British to escape and linked him to the previous winter's alleged conspiracy against Washington.\nAlthough the first two charges proved to be dubious, Lee was undeniably guilty of disrespect, and Washington was too powerful to cross. As the historian John Shy noted, \"Under the circumstances, an acquittal on the first two charges would have been a vote of no-confidence in Washington.\" Lee was found guilty on all three counts, but the court deleted \"shameful\" from the second and noted the retreat was \"disorderly\" only \"in some few instances.\" Lee was suspended from the army for a year, a sentence so lenient that some interpreted it as a vindication of all but the charge of disrespect. Lee continued to argue his case and rage against Washington to anyone who would listen, prompting both Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens, one of Washington's aides, and Steuben to challenge him to a duel. Only the duel with Laurens actually transpired on 23 December 1778, during which Lee was wounded in the side. Laurens, believing the wound was more serious than it seemed, went to help the general. However, Lee said it was fine and proposed to shoot a second time. The men's seconds, Alexander Hamilton and Evan Edwards, opposed this idea and had the duel end there, despite Lee's protests to fire again and Laurens's agreeance. In 1780, Lee sent such a poorly received letter to Congress that it terminated his service with the army.\nLater life and death.\nLee retired to his Prato Rio property, where he bred horses and dogs. However, debts had again accumulated, and his advisors recommended liquidating the property. By the spring of 1780, in addition to more frequent gout attacks, Lee had acquired a chronic cough which with other symptoms might have indicated tuberculosis. He made a final tour of Baltimore, Williamsburg, and Fredericksburg, Virginia; Frederick, Maryland; and western Pennsylvania. While visiting Philadelphia to complete the property's sale (that to Maryland buyers having fallen through), he was stricken with fever and died in an inn on 2 October 1782. Despite a provision of his will that denounced organized religion and specifically forbade burial near a church or religious meeting house, his remains were taken to the City Tavern for friends and dignitaries to pay their respects, then a military escort took his remains to Christ Church, where after a brief Anglican service, Lee was buried in the churchyard in an unmarked grave. Lee left his property to his sister, Sidney Lee, who died unmarried in 1788.\nLegacy.\nLee considered Native Americans as fitting the model of the noble savage, as did others of his time, including his friend Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet. Describing them as \"hospitable, friendly and civil to an immense degree\", Lee wrote letters home to his family and friends, urging them to educate themselves on the truth against the media's false reports on the Natives: \"I can assure you that they are a much better sort of people than commonly represented\".\nLee's last home, Prato Rio, still exists, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A historical marker indicates General Lee's service. Much of the adjoining property, which has many natural springs, has been federally owned since 1931, and is currently operated by the U.S. Geological Survey as the Leetown Science Center (formerly the National Fish Hatchery and Research Station), as well as the federal agency's eastern regional office.\nFort Lee, New Jersey, on the west side of the Hudson River (across the water from Fort Washington, New York), was named for him during his life. Lee, Massachusetts; Lee, New Hampshire; and Leetown, West Virginia were also named for him.\nLee's place in history was further tarnished in the 1850s when George H. Moore, the librarian at the New-York Historical Society, discovered a manuscript dated 29 March 1777, written by Lee while he was a British prisoner of war. It was addressed to the \"Royal Commissioners\", i.e., Richard Howe, later 1st Earl Howe, and Richard's brother, Sir William Howe, later 5th Viscount Howe, respectively the British naval and army commanders in North America at the time, and detailed a plan by which the British might defeat the rebellion. Moore's discovery, presented in a paper titled \"The Treason of Charles Lee\" in 1858, influenced perceptions of Lee for decades. Lee's infamy became orthodoxy in such 19th-century works as Washington Irving's \"Life of George Washington\" (1855\u20131859), George Washington Parke Custis's \"Recollections and Private Memoirs of Washington\" (1861) and George Bancroft's \"History of the United States of America, from the Discovery of the American Continent\" (1854\u20131878). Although most modern scholars reject the idea that Lee was guilty of treason, it is given credence in some accounts, examples being Willard Sterne Randall's account of the Battle of Monmouth in \"George Washington: A Life\" (1997), and Dominick Mazzagetti's \"Charles Lee: Self Before Country\" (2013).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "52293", "revid": "47844293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52293", "title": "Origami", "text": "Japanese art of paper folding\n is the Japanese art of paper folding. In modern usage, the word \"origami\" is often used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word \"\" to refer to designs which use cuts.\nIn the detailed Japanese classification, origami is divided into stylized ceremonial origami (\u5100\u793c\u6298\u308a\u7d19, \"girei origami\") and recreational origami (\u904a\u622f\u6298\u308a\u7d19, \"y\u016bgi origami\"), and only recreational origami is generally recognized as origami. In Japan, ceremonial origami is generally called \"origata\" () to distinguish it from recreational origami. The term \"origata\" is one of the old terms for origami.\nThe small number of basic origami folds can be combined in a variety of ways to make intricate designs. The best-known origami model is the Japanese paper crane. In general, these designs begin with a square sheet of paper whose sides may be of different colors, prints, or patterns. Traditional Japanese origami, which has been practiced since the Edo period (1603\u20131868), has often been less strict about these conventions, sometimes cutting the paper or using nonsquare shapes to start with. The principles of origami are also used in stents, packaging, and other engineering applications.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"origami\" is a compound of two smaller words: \"ori\" (root verb \"oru\"), meaning to fold, and \"kami\", meaning paper. Until recently, not all forms of paper folding were grouped under the word origami. Before that, paper folding for play was known by a variety of names, including \"orikata\" or \"origata\" (\u6298\u5f62), \"orisue\" (\u6298\u636e), \"orimono\" (\u6298\u7269), \"tatamigami\" (\u7573\u7d19) and others.\nHistory.\nDistinct paperfolding traditions arose in Europe, China, and Japan which have been well-documented by historians. These seem to have been mostly separate traditions, until the 20th century.\nCeremonial origami (origata).\nBy the 7th century, paper had been introduced to Japan from China via the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese developed \"washi\" by improving the method of making paper in the Heian period. The papermaking technique developed in Japan around 805 to 809 was called \"nagashi-suki (\u6d41\u3057\u6f09\u304d)\", a method of adding mucilage to the process of the conventional \"tame-suki (\u6e9c\u3081\u6f09\u304d)\" technique to form a stronger layer of paper fibers. With the development of Japanese papermaking technology and the widespread use of paper, folded paper began to be used for decorations and tools for religious ceremonies such as \"gohei\", \"\u014dnusa\" () and \"shide\" at Shinto shrines. Religious decorations made of paper and the way gifts were wrapped in folded paper gradually became stylized and established as ceremonial origami. During the Heian period, the Imperial court established a code of etiquette for wrapping money and goods used in ceremonies with folded paper, and a code of etiquette for wrapping gifts.\nIn the Muromachi period from the 1300s to the 1400s, various forms of decorum were developed by the Ogasawara clan and Ise clans (), completing the prototype of Japanese folded-paper decorum that continues to this day. The Ise clan presided over the decorum of the inside of the palace of the Ashikaga Shogunate, and in particular, Ise Sadachika () during the reign of the eighth Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshimasa (\u8db3\u5229\u7fa9\u653f), greatly influenced the development of the decorum of the daimyo and samurai classes, leading to the development of various stylized forms of ceremonial origami. The shapes of ceremonial origami created in this period were geometric, and the shapes of \"noshi\" to be attached to gifts at feasts and weddings, and origami that imitated butterflies to be displayed on sake vessels, were quite different from those of later generations of recreational origami whose shapes captured the characteristics of real objects and living things. The \"noshi\" wrapping, and the folding of female and male butterflies, which are still used for weddings and celebrations, are a continuation and development of a tradition that began in the Muromachi period. A reference in a poem by Ihara Saikaku from 1680 describes the origami butterflies used during Shinto weddings to represent the bride and groom.\nRecreational origami.\n1500s\uff0d1800s.\nIt is not certain when play-made paper models, now commonly known as origami, began in Japan. However, the \"kozuka\" of a Japanese sword made by Got\u014d Eij\u014d (\u5f8c\u85e4\u6804\u4e57) between the end of the 1500s and the beginning of the 1600s was decorated with a picture of a crane made of origami, and it is believed that origami for play existed by the Sengoku period or the early Edo period.\nIn 1747, during the Edo period, a book titled \"Ranma zushiki\" (\u6b04\u9593\u56f3\u5f0f) was published, which contained various designs of the \"ranma\" (), a decoration of Japanese architecture. This included origami of various designs, including paper models of cranes, which are still well known today. It is thought that by this time, many people were familiar with origami for play, which modern people recognize as origami. During this period, origami was commonly called \"orikata\" (\u6298\u5f62) or \"orisue\" (\u6298\u636e) and was often used as a pattern on kimonos and decorations.\n\"Hiden senbazuru orikata ()\", published in 1797, is the oldest known technical book on origami for play. The book contains 49 origami pieces created by a Buddhist monk named Gid\u014d () in Ise Province, whose works were named and accompanied by \"ky\u014dka\" (\u72c2\u6b4c, comic \"tanka\") by author Akisato Rit\u014d (\u79cb\u91cc\u7c6c\u5cf6). These pieces were far more technically advanced than their predecessors, suggesting that origami culture had become more sophisticated. Gido continued to produce origami after the publication of his book, leaving at least 158 highly skilled masterpieces for posterity. In 1976, Kuwana City in Mie Prefecture, Gido's hometown, designated 49 of the methods described in the \"Hiden senbazuru orikata\" as Intangible Cultural Properties of Kuwana City. Kuwana City has also certified qualified persons who are able to correctly produce these works and have in-depth knowledge of the art. Kuwana City has published some of the origami production methods on YouTube.\nFrom the late Edo period to the Bakumatu period, origami that imitated the six legendary Japanese poets, \"rokkasen\" (\u516d\u6b4c\u4ed9) listed in the \"Kokin Wakash\u016b\" (\u53e4\u4eca\u548c\u6b4c\u96c6) compiled in the 900s and the characters in \"Ch\u016bshingura\" became popular, but today they are rarely used as subjects for origami.\nIn Europe, there was a well-developed genre of napkin folding, which flourished during the 17th and 18th centuries. After this period, this genre declined and was mostly forgotten; historian Joan Sallas attributes this to the introduction of porcelain, which replaced complex napkin folds as a dinner-table status symbol among nobility. However, some of the techniques and bases associated with this tradition continued to be a part of European culture; folding was a significant part of Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel's \"Kindergarten\" method, and the designs published in connection with his curriculum are stylistically similar to the napkin fold repertoire. Another example of early origami in Europe is the \"pajarita,\" a stylized bird whose origins date from at least the nineteenth century.\nSince 1800s.\nWhen Japan opened its borders in the 1860s, as part of a modernization strategy, they imported Fr\u00f6bel's Kindergarten system\u2014and with it, German ideas about paperfolding. This included the ban on cuts, and the starting shape of a bicolored square. These ideas, and some of the European folding repertoire, were integrated into the Japanese tradition. Before this, traditional Japanese sources use a variety of starting shapes, often had cuts, and if they had color or markings, these were added after the model was folded. In Japan, the first kindergarten was established in 1875, and origami was promoted as part of early childhood education. The kindergarten's 1877 regulations listed 25 activities, including origami subjects. \"Sh\u014dkokumin\" (\u5c0f\u56fd\u6c11), a magazine for boys, frequently published articles on origami. \"Origami Zusetsu\" (\u6298\u7d19\u56f3\u8aac), published in 1908, clearly distinguished ceremonial origami from recreational origami. These books and magazines carried both the traditional Japanese style of origami and the style inspired by Fr\u00f6bel.\nIn the early 1900s, Akira Yoshizawa, Kosho Uchiyama, and others began creating and recording original origami works. Akira Yoshizawa in particular was responsible for a number of innovations, such as wet-folding and the Yoshizawa\u2013Randlett diagramming system, and his work inspired a renaissance of the art form.\nIn 1974, origami was offered in the USSR as an additional activity for elementary school children.\nDuring the 1980s a number of folders started systematically studying the mathematical properties of folded forms, which led to a rapid increase in the complexity of origami models.\nStarting in the late 20th century, there has been a renewed interest in understanding the behavior of folding matter, both artistically and scientifically. The \"new origami,\" which distinguishes it from old craft practices, has had a rapid evolution due to the contribution of computational mathematics and the development of techniques such as \"box-pleating\", \"tessellations\" and \"wet-folding\". Artists like Robert J. Lang, Erik Demaine, Sipho Mabona, https://, http://, and others, are frequently cited for advancing new applications of the art. The computational facet and the interchanges through social networks, where new techniques and designs are introduced, have raised the profile of origami in the 21st century.\nTechniques and materials.\nTechniques.\nMany origami books begin with a description of basic origami techniques which are used to construct the models. This includes simple diagrams of basic folds like valley and mountain folds, pleats, reverse folds, squash folds, and sinks. There are also standard named bases which are used in a wide variety of models, for instance the bird base is an intermediate stage in the construction of the flapping bird. Additional bases are the preliminary base (square base), fish base, waterbomb base, and the frog base.\nOrigami paper.\nAlmost any laminar (flat) material can be used for folding; the only requirement is that it should hold a crease.\nOrigami paper, often referred to as \"kami\" (Japanese for paper), is sold in prepackaged squares of various sizes ranging from 2.5\u00a0cm (1\u00a0in) to 25\u00a0cm (10\u00a0in) or more. It is commonly colored on one side and white on the other; however, dual coloured and patterned versions exist and can be used effectively for color-changed models. Origami paper weighs slightly less than copy paper, making it suitable for a wider range of models.\nNormal copy paper with weights of 70\u201390 g/m2 (19\u201324\u00a0lb) can be used for simple folds, such as the crane and waterbomb. Heavier weight papers of\n100 g/m2 (approx. 25\u00a0lb) or more can be wet-folded. This technique allows for a more rounded sculpting of the model, which becomes rigid and sturdy when it is dry.\nFoil-backed paper, as its name implies, is a sheet of thin foil glued to a sheet of thin paper. Related to this is tissue foil, which is made by gluing a thin piece of tissue paper to kitchen aluminium foil. A second piece of tissue can be glued onto the reverse side to produce a tissue/foil/tissue sandwich. Foil-backed paper is available commercially, but not tissue foil; it must be handmade. Both types of foil materials are suitable for complex models.\n is the traditional origami paper used in Japan. Washi is generally tougher than ordinary paper made from wood pulp, and is used in many traditional arts. Washi is commonly made using fibres from the bark of the gampi tree, the mitsumata shrub (\"Edgeworthia papyrifera\"), or the paper mulberry but can also be made using bamboo, hemp, rice, and wheat.\nArtisan papers such as unryu, lokta, hanji, gampi, kozo, saa, and abaca have long fibers and are often extremely strong. As these papers are floppy to start with, they are often backcoated or resized with methylcellulose or wheat paste before folding. Also, these papers are extremely thin and compressible, allowing for thin, narrowed limbs as in the case of insect models.\nPaper money from various countries is also popular to create origami with; this is known variously as Dollar Origami, Orikane, and Money Origami.\nTools.\nIt is common to fold using a flat surface, but some folders like doing it in the air with no tools, especially when displaying the folding. Some folders believe that no tool should be used when folding. However a couple of tools can help especially with the more complex models. For instance a bone folder allows sharp creases to be made in the paper easily, paper clips can act as extra pairs of fingers, and tweezers can be used to make small folds. When making complex models from origami crease patterns, it can help to use a ruler and ballpoint embosser to score the creases. Completed models can be sprayed so that they keep their shape better, and a spray is needed when wet folding.\nTypes.\nAction origami.\nIn addition to the more common still-life origami, there are also moving object designs; origami can move. Action origami includes origami that flies, requires inflation to complete, or, when complete, uses the kinetic energy of a person's hands, applied at a certain region on the model, to move another flap or limb. Some argue that, strictly speaking, only the latter is really \"recognized\" as action origami. Action origami, first appearing with the traditional Japanese flapping bird, is quite common. One example is Robert Lang's instrumentalists; when the figures' heads are pulled away from their bodies, their hands will move, resembling the playing of music.\nModular origami.\nModular origami consists of putting a number of identical pieces together to form a complete model. Often the individual pieces are simple, but the final assembly may be more difficult. Many modular origami models are decorative folding balls such as kusudama, which differ from classical origami in that the pieces may be held together using thread or glue.\nChinese paper folding, a cousin of origami, includes a similar style called golden venture folding where large numbers of pieces are put together to create elaborate models. This style is most commonly known as \"3D origami\". However, that name did not appear until Joie Staff published a series of books titled \"3D Origami\", \"More 3D Origami\", and \"More and More 3D Origami\". This style originated from some Chinese refugees while they were detained in America and is also called Golden Venture folding from the ship they came on.\nWet-folding.\nWet-folding is an origami technique for producing models with gentle curves rather than geometric straight folds and flat surfaces. The paper is dampened so it can be moulded easily, and the final model keeps its shape when it dries. It can be used, for instance, to produce very natural looking animal models. Size, an adhesive that is crisp and hard when dry, but dissolves in water when wet and becoming soft and flexible, is often applied to the paper either at the pulp stage while the paper is being formed, or on the surface of a ready sheet of paper. The latter method is called external sizing and most commonly uses Methylcellulose, or MC, paste, or various plant starches.\nPureland origami.\nPureland origami adds the restrictions that only simple mountain/valley folds may be used, and all folds must have straightforward locations. It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills. Some designers also like the challenge of creating within the very strict constraints.\nOrigami tessellations.\nOrigami tessellation is a branch that has grown in popularity after 2000. A tessellation is a collection of figures filling a plane with no gaps or overlaps. In origami tessellations, pleats are used to connect molecules such as twist folds together in a repeating fashion. During the 1960s, Shuzo Fujimoto was the first to explore twist fold tessellations in any systematic way, coming up with dozens of patterns and establishing the genre in the origami mainstream. Around the same time period, Ron Resch patented some tessellation patterns as part of his explorations into kinetic sculpture and developable surfaces, although his work was not known by the origami community until the 1980s. Chris Palmer is an artist who has extensively explored tessellations after seeing the Zilij patterns in the Alhambra, and has found ways to create detailed origami tessellations out of silk. Robert Lang and Alex Bateman are two designers who use computer programs to create origami tessellations. The first international convention devoted to origami tessellations was hosted in Bras\u00edlia (Brazil) in 2006, and the first instruction book on tessellation folding patterns was published by Eric Gjerde in 2008. Since then, the field has grown very quickly. Tessellation artists include Polly Verity (Scotland); Joel Cooper, Christine Edison, Ray Schamp and Goran Konjevod from the US; Roberto Gretter (Italy); Christiane Bettens (Switzerland); Carlos Natan L\u00f3pez (Mexico); and Jorge C. Lucero (Brazil).\nKirigami.\nKirigami is a Japanese term for paper cutting. Cutting was often used in traditional Japanese origami, but modern innovations in technique have made the use of cuts unnecessary. Most origami designers no longer consider models with cuts to be origami, instead using the term Kirigami to describe them. This change in attitude occurred during the 1960s and 70s, so early origami books often use cuts, but for the most part they have disappeared from the modern origami repertoire, and most modern books do not even mention cutting.\nStrip folding.\nStrip folding is a combination of paper folding and paper weaving. A common example of strip folding is called the Lucky Star, also called Chinese lucky star, dream star, wishing star, or simply origami star. Another common fold is the Moravian star which is made by strip folding in a 3-dimensional design to include 16 spikes.\nTeabag folding.\nTeabag folding is credited to Dutch artist Tiny van der Plas, who developed the technique in 1992 as a papercraft art for embellishing greeting cards. It uses small square pieces of paper (e.g., a tea bag wrapper) bearing symmetrical designs that are folded in such a way that they interlock and produce a three-dimensional version of the underlying design. The basic kite fold is used to produce rosettes that are a 3 dimensional version of the 2D design.\nThe basic rosette design requires eight matching squares to be folded into the 'kite' design. Mathematics teachers find the designs very useful as a practical way of demonstrating some basic properties of symmetry.\nMathematics and technical origami.\nMathematics and practical applications.\nThe practice and study of origami encapsulates several subjects of mathematical interest. For instance, the problem of \"flat-foldability\" (whether a crease pattern can be folded into a 2-dimensional model) has been a topic of considerable mathematical study.\nA number of technological advances have come from insights obtained through paper folding. For example, techniques have been developed for the deployment of car airbags and stent implants from a folded position.\nThe problem of rigid origami (\"if we replaced the paper with sheet metal and had hinges in place of the crease lines, could we still fold the model?\") has great practical importance. For example, the Miura map fold is a rigid fold that has been used to deploy large solar panel arrays for space satellites.\nOrigami can be used to construct various geometrical designs not possible with compass and straightedge constructions. For instance paper folding may be used for angle trisection and doubling the cube.\nTechnical origami.\nTechnical origami, known in Japanese as , is an origami design approach in which the model is conceived as an engineered crease pattern, rather than developed through trial-and-error. With advances in origami mathematics, the basic structure of a new origami model can be theoretically plotted out on paper before any actual folding even occurs. This method of origami design was developed by Robert Lang, Meguro Toshiyuki and others, and allows for the creation of extremely complex multi-limbed models such as many-legged centipedes, human figures with a full complement of fingers and toes, and the like.\nThe crease pattern is a layout of the creases required to form the structure of the model. Paradoxically enough, when origami designers come up with a crease pattern for a new design, the majority of the smaller creases are relatively unimportant and added only towards the completion of the model. What is more important is the allocation of regions of the paper and how these are mapped to the structure of the object being designed. By opening up a folded model, you can observe the structures that comprise it; the study of these structures led to a number of crease-pattern-oriented design approaches\nThe pattern of allocations is referred to as the 'circle-packing' or 'polygon-packing'. Using optimization algorithms, a circle-packing figure can be computed for any uniaxial base of arbitrary complexity. Once this figure is computed, the creases which are then used to obtain the base structure can be added. This is not a unique mathematical process, hence it is possible for two designs to have the same circle-packing, and yet different crease pattern structures.\nAs a circle encloses the maximum amount of area for a given perimeter, circle packing allows for maximum efficiency in terms of paper usage. However, other polygonal shapes can be used to solve the packing problem as well. The use of polygonal shapes other than circles is often motivated by the desire to find easily locatable creases (such as multiples of 22.5 degrees) and hence an easier folding sequence as well. One popular offshoot of the circle packing method is box-pleating, where squares are used instead of circles. As a result, the crease pattern that arises from this method contains only 45 and 90 degree angles, which often makes for a more direct folding sequence.\nOrigami-related computer programs.\nA number of computer aids to origami such as TreeMaker and Oripa, have been devised. TreeMaker allows new origami bases to be designed for special purposes and Oripa tries to calculate the folded shape from the crease pattern.\nEthics and copyright.\nCopyright in origami designs and the use of models has become an increasingly important issue in the origami community, as the internet has made the sale and distribution of pirated designs very easy. It is considered good etiquette to always credit the original artist and the folder when displaying origami models. It has been claimed that all commercial rights to designs and models are typically reserved by origami artists; however, the degree to which this can be enforced has been disputed. Under such a view, a person who folds a model using a legally obtained design could publicly display the model unless such rights were specifically reserved, whereas folding a design for money or commercial use of a photo for instance would require consent. The http:// group was set up to represent the copyright interests of origami artists and facilitate permissions requests.\nHowever, a court in Japan has asserted that the folding method of an origami model \"comprises an idea and not a creative expression, and thus is not protected under the copyright law\". Further, the court stated that \"the method to folding origami is in the public domain; one cannot avoid using the same folding creases or the same arrows to show the direction in which to fold the paper\". Therefore, it is legal to redraw the folding instructions of a model of another author even if the redrawn instructions share similarities to the original ones, as long as those similarities are \"functional in nature\". The redrawn instructions may be published (and even sold) without necessity of any permission from the original author.\nOrigami in various meanings.\nFrom a global perspective, the term 'origami' refers to the folding of paper to shape objects for entertainment purposes, but it has historically been used in various ways in Japan.\nFor example, the term 'origami' also refers to the certificate of authenticity that accompanies a Japanese sword or tea utensil. The people of the Hon'ami clan, who were the authority on Japanese sword appraisal from the Muromachi period to the Edo period, responded to the requests of the shogun, daimyo and samurai by appraising Japanese swords, determining when and by which school the sword was made, whether the inscription on the \"nakago\" was genuine or not, and what the price was, and then issuing origami with the results written on it. This has led to the Japanese word 'origami tsuki' (\u6298\u308a\u7d19\u4ed8\u304d) meaning 'origami is attached' meaning that the quality of the object or the ability of the person is sufficiently high.\nThe term 'origami' also referred to a specific style of old documents in Japan. The paper folded vertically is called 'tategami' (\u7aea\u7d19), while the paper folded horizontally is called 'origami', and origami has a lower status than tategami. This style of letter began to be used at the end of the Heian period, and in the Kamakura period it was used as a complaint, and origami came to refer to the complaint itself. Furthermore, during the Muromachi period, origami was often used as a command document or a catalog of gifts, and it came to refer to the catalog of gifts itself.\nGallery.\nThese pictures show examples of various types of origami.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Jefferson began designing Monticello after inheriting land from his father at the age of 14. Located just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, in the Piedmont region, the plantation was originally , with Jefferson using the forced labor of enslaved black people for extensive cultivation of tobacco and mixed crops, later shifting from tobacco cultivation to wheat in response to changing markets. Due to its architectural and historic significance, the property has been designated a National Historic Landmark. In 1987, Monticello and the nearby University of Virginia, also designed by Jefferson, were together designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The United States nickel has featured a depiction of Monticello on its reverse every year since 1938 with the exception of 2004-05.\nJefferson designed the main house using neoclassical design principles pioneered by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio and reworking the design through much of his presidency to include design elements popular in late 18th-century Europe and integrating numerous ideas of his own. Situated on the summit of an peak in the Southwest Mountains south of the Rivanna Gap, the name Monticello derives from Italian meaning \"little mountain\". Along a prominent lane adjacent to the house, Mulberry Row, the plantation came to include numerous outbuildings for specialized functions, e.g., a nailery; quarters for slaves who worked in the home; gardens for flowers, produce, and Jefferson's experiments in plant breeding\u2014along with tobacco fields and mixed crops. Cabins for slaves who worked in the fields were farther from the mansion.\nAt Jefferson's direction, he was buried on the grounds, in an area now designated as the Monticello Cemetery. The cemetery is owned by the Monticello Association, a society of his descendants through Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson. After Jefferson's death, his daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph, apart from the small family graveyard, sold Monticello for $7,500. In 1834, it was bought and saved from ruin by Uriah P. Levy, a commodore in the U.S. Navy, for $2,500, (~$ in 2024) who admired Jefferson and spent significant funds to preserve the property. His nephew Jefferson Monroe Levy took over the property in 1879; he also invested considerable funds to restore and preserve it. In 1923, Monroe Levy sold it for $500,000 (~$ in 2024) to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (TJF), which operates it as a house museum and educational institution.\nDesign and building.\nJefferson's home was built to serve as a plantation house, which ultimately took on the architectural form of a villa. Work began on what historians would subsequently refer to as \"the first Monticello\" in 1768, on a plantation of . Jefferson moved into the South Pavilion (an outbuilding) in 1770, where his new wife Martha Wayles Skelton joined him in 1772. Jefferson continued work on his original design, but how much was completed is of some dispute. In constructing and later reconstructing his home, Jefferson used a combination of free workers, indentured servants, and enslaved people.\nAfter his wife's death in 1782, Jefferson left Monticello in 1784 to serve as Minister of the United States to France. During his several years in Europe, he had an opportunity to see some of the classical buildings with which he had become acquainted from his reading, as well as to discover the \"modern\" trends in French architecture that were then fashionable in Paris. His decision to extensively remodel and rebuild his own home may date from this period. In 1794, following his tenure as the first U.S. Secretary of State (1790\u20131793), Jefferson began rebuilding his house based on the ideas he had acquired in Europe. The remodeling continued throughout most of his presidency (1801\u20131809). Although generally completed by 1809, Jefferson continued work on Monticello until his death in 1826.\nJefferson added a center hallway and a parallel set of rooms to the structure, more than doubling its area. He removed the second full-height story from the original house and replaced it with a mezzanine bedroom floor. The interior is centered on two large rooms, which served as an entrance-hall-museum, where Jefferson displayed his scientific interests, and a music-sitting room. The most dramatic element of the new design was an octagonal dome, which he placed above the west front of the building in place of a second-story portico. The room inside the dome was described by a visitor as \"a noble and beautiful apartment,\" but it was rarely used\u2014perhaps because it was hot in summer and cold in winter, or because it could be reached only by climbing a steep and very narrow flight of stairs. The dome room has now been restored to its appearance during Jefferson's lifetime, with \"Mars yellow\" walls and a painted green and black checkered floor.\nSummertime temperatures are high in the region, with indoor temperatures of around . Jefferson himself is known to have been interested in Roman and Renaissance texts about ancient temperature-control techniques such as ground-cooled air and heated floors. Monticello's large central hall and aligned windows were designed to allow a cooling air-current to pass through the house, and the octagonal cupola draws hot air up and out. In the late twentieth century, moderate air conditioning, designed to avoid the harm to the house and its contents that would be caused by major modifications and large temperature differentials, was installed in the house, a tourist attraction.\nBefore Jefferson's death, Monticello had begun to show signs of disrepair. The attention Jefferson's university project in Charlottesville demanded, and family problems, diverted his focus. The most important reason for the mansion's deterioration was his accumulating debts. In the last few years of Jefferson's life, much went without repair in Monticello. A witness, Samuel Whitcomb Jr., who visited Jefferson in 1824, thought it run down. He said, \"His house is rather old and going to decay; appearances about his yard and hill are rather slovenly. It commands an extensive prospect but it being a misty cloudy day, I could see but little of the surrounding scenery.\"\nPreservation.\nAfter Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, his only official surviving daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, inherited Monticello. The estate was encumbered with debt and Martha Randolph had financial problems in her own family because of her husband's mental illness. In 1831, she sold Monticello to James Turner Barclay, a local apothecary, for $7,500 (~$ in 2024). Barclay sold it in 1834 to Uriah P. Levy for $2,500, (~$ in 2024) the first Jewish commodore (equivalent to today's rear admiral) in the United States Navy. A fifth-generation American whose family first settled in Savannah, Georgia, Levy greatly admired Jefferson and used private funds to repair, restore and preserve the house. The Confederate government seized the house as enemy property at the outset of the American Civil War and sold it to Confederate officer Benjamin Franklin Ficklin. Levy's estate recovered the property after the war.\nLevy's heirs argued over his estate, but their lawsuits were settled in 1879, when Uriah Levy's nephew, Jefferson Monroe Levy, a prominent New York lawyer, real estate speculator, and stock speculator (and later member of Congress), bought out the other heirs for $10,050, (~$ in 2024) and took control of Monticello. Like his uncle, Jefferson Levy commissioned repairs, restoration and preservation of the grounds and house, which had been deteriorating seriously while the lawsuits wound their way through the courts in New York and Virginia. Together, the Levys preserved Monticello for nearly 100 years.\nIn 1909, Maud Littleton, the wife of Martin W. Littleton, visited Monticello. Following her visit, Littleton launched a nationwide antisemitic campaign to have Monticello expropriated from Jefferson Levy. Littleton took her campaign to the press as well as to Congress, with two bills to expropriate Monticello from Levy failing to pass. Littleton used veiled antisemitic remarks to disparage Levy, such as calling him an \"alien\", \"oriental\", and a \"rank outsider\" who had allegedly altered the character of \"the house that Jefferson built and made sacred.\" Littleton also made attempts to purchase Monticello. Angered by Littleton's antisemitism, Levy refused to sell his property. However, due to strained finances, Levy reluctantly sold Monticello to a foundation. Maud Littleton became the organization's first executive director. For the next 60 years, mention of the Levy family was erased by the foundation, despite the fact that Levy's mother Rachel is buried at Monticello. Neglected for decades, Rachel's grave was refurbished in 1985, under the foundation's new executive director Daniel Jordan.\nIn 1923, a private non-profit organization, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, purchased the house from Jefferson Levy for $500,000 (~$ in 2024) with funds raised by Theodore Fred Kuper and others. They managed additional restoration under architects including Fiske Kimball and Milton L. Grigg. Since that time, other restoration has been performed at Monticello.\nThe Jefferson Foundation operates Monticello and its grounds as a house museum and educational institution. Visitors can wander the grounds, as well as tour rooms in the cellar and ground floor. More expensive tour pass options include sunset hours, as well as tours of the second floor and the third floor, including the iconic dome.\nMonticello is a National Historic Landmark. It is the only private home in the United States to be designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Included in that designation are the original grounds and buildings of Jefferson's University of Virginia. From 1989 to 1992, a team of architects from the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) created a collection of measured drawings of Monticello. These drawings are held by the Library of Congress.\nAmong Jefferson's other designs are Poplar Forest, his private retreat near Lynchburg (which he intended for his daughter Maria, who died at age 25), the \"academic village\" of the University of Virginia, and the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond.\nDecoration and furnishings.\nMuch of Monticello's interior decoration reflects the personal ideas and ideals of Jefferson.\nThe original main entrance is through the portico on the east front. The ceiling of this portico incorporates a wind plate connected to a weather vane, showing the direction of the wind. A large clock face on the external east-facing wall has only an hour hand since Jefferson thought this was accurate enough for those he enslaved. The clock reflects the time shown on the \"Great Clock\", designed by Jefferson, in the entrance hall. The entrance hall contains recreations of items collected by Lewis and Clark on the cross-country expedition commissioned by Jefferson to explore the Louisiana Purchase. Jefferson had the floorcloth painted a \"true grass green\" upon the recommendation of artist Gilbert Stuart, so that Jefferson's \"essay in architecture\" could invite the spirit of the outdoors into the house.\nThe south wing includes Jefferson's private suite of rooms. The library holds many books from his third library collection. His first library was burned in an accidental plantation fire, and he 'ceded' (or sold) his second library in 1815 to the United States Congress to replace the books lost in the 1814 burning of Washington during the War of 1812. This second library formed the nucleus of the Library of Congress.\nAs \"larger than life\" as Monticello seems, the house has approximately of living space. Jefferson considered much furniture to be a waste of space, so the dining room table was erected only at mealtimes, and beds were built into alcoves cut into thick walls that contain storage space. Jefferson's bed opens to two sides: to his cabinet (study) and to his bedroom (dressing room).\nIn 2017, a room identified as Sally Hemings' quarters at Monticello, adjacent to Jefferson's bedroom, was discovered in an archeological excavation. It will be restored and refurbished. This is part of the Mountaintop Project, which includes restorations in order to give a fuller account of the lives of both enslaved and free families at Monticello.\nThe west front gives the impression of a villa of modest proportions, with a lower floor disguised in the hillside.\nThe north wing includes two guest bedrooms and the dining room. It has a dumbwaiter incorporated into the fireplace, as well as dumbwaiters (shelved tables on casters) and a pivoting serving door with shelves.\nFood and cuisine.\nMonticello is known as the birthplace of macaroni and cheese in the United States. While it is a myth that Monticello is its American birthplace, it is true that it was made popular there. Jefferson's enslaved cook James Hemings, brother of Sally Hemings, Jefferson's enslaved mistress, perfected the dish and made it similar to the way it is prepared today.\nQuarters for slaves on Mulberry Row.\nJefferson located one set of his quarters for enslaved people on Mulberry Row, a road of slave, service, and industrial structures. Mulberry Row was situated south of Monticello, with the quarters facing the Jefferson mansion. These cabins were occupied by the black slaves who worked in the mansion or in Jefferson's manufacturing ventures, and not by those who labored in the fields. At one point, \"Jefferson sketched out plans for a row of substantial, dignified neoclassical houses\" for Mulberry Row, for enslaved blacks and white workers, \"having in mind an integrated row of residences.\"\nArchaeology of the site shows that the rooms of the cabins were much larger in the 1770s than in the 1790s. Researchers disagree as to whether this indicates that more enslaved people were crowded into smaller spaces, or that fewer people lived in the smaller spaces. Earlier quarters for enslaved people had a two-room plan, one family per room, with a single, shared doorway to the outside. But from the 1790s on, all rooms/families had independent doorways. Most of the cabins are free-standing, single-room structures.\nBy the time of Jefferson's death, some enslaved families had labored and lived for four generations at Monticello. Thomas Jefferson recorded his strategy for child labor in his Farm Book. Until the age of 10, children served as nurses. When the plantation grew tobacco, children were at a good height to remove and kill tobacco worms from the crops. Once he began growing wheat, fewer people were needed to maintain the crops, so Jefferson established manual trades. He stated that children \"go into the ground or learn trades\". When girls were 16, they began spinning and weaving textiles. Boys made nails from age 10 to 16. In 1794, Jefferson had a dozen boys working at the nailery. While working at the nailery, boys received more food (during this period, cornmeal and salted fish were common rations for the enslaved) and may have received new clothes if they did a good job. After the nailery, boys became blacksmiths, coopers, carpenters, or house servants.\nSix families and their descendants were featured in the exhibit, \"Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: Paradox of Liberty\" (January to October 2012) at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, which also examined Jefferson as an enslaver. Developed as a collaboration between the National Museum of African American History and Culture and Monticello, it is the first exhibit on the national mall to address such issues.\nIn February 2012, Monticello opened a new outdoor exhibit on its grounds: \"Landscape of Slavery: Mulberry Row at Monticello,\" to convey more about the lives of the hundreds of slaves who lived and worked at the plantation.\nOutbuildings and plantation.\nThe main house was augmented by small outlying pavilions to the north and south. A row of outbuildings (dairy, a washhouse, store houses, a small nail factory, a joinery, etc.) and quarters for slaves (log cabins), known as Mulberry Row, lay nearby to the south. A stone weaver's cottage survives, as does the tall chimney of the joinery, and the foundations of other buildings. A cabin on Mulberry Row was, for a time, the home of Sally Hemings, Jefferson's sister-in-law and a slave woman who worked in the household. Hemings is widely believed to have had a 38-year relationship with the widower Jefferson and to have borne six children by him, four of whom survived to adulthood. The genealogist Helen F.M. Leary concluded that \"the chain of evidence securely fastens Sally Hemings's children to their father, Thomas Jefferson.\" Later Hemings lived in a room in the \"south dependency\" below the main house.\nOn the slope below Mulberry Row, African slaves maintained an extensive vegetable garden for the main house. In addition to growing flowers for display and producing crops for eating, Jefferson used the gardens of Monticello for experimenting with different species. The house was the center of a plantation of tended by some 150 slaves. There are also two houses included in the whole.\nProgramming.\nIn recent decades, the TJF has created programs to more fully interpret the lives of slaves at Monticello. Beginning in 1993, researchers interviewed descendants of Monticello slaves for the \"Getting Word Project\", a collection of oral history that provided much new insight into the lives of slaves at Monticello and their descendants. (Among findings were that no slaves adopted Jefferson as a surname, but many had their own surnames as early as the 18th century.)\nSome of Mulberry Row has been designated as archeological sites, where excavations and analysis are revealing much about the life of slaves at the plantation. In the winter of 2000\u20132001, the African slave burial ground at Monticello was discovered. In the fall of 2001, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation held a commemoration of the burial ground, in which the names of known slaves of Monticello were read aloud. Additional archeological work is providing information about African American burial practices.\nIn 2003, Monticello welcomed a reunion of descendants of Jefferson from both the Wayles's and Hemings's sides of the family. It was organized by the descendants, who have created a new group called the Monticello Community. Additional and larger reunions have since been held.\nLand purchase.\nIn 2004, the trustees of TJF acquired Mountaintop Farm (also known locally as Patterson's or Brown's Mountain), the only property that overlooks Monticello. Jefferson had called the taller mountain Montalto. To prevent development of new homes on the site, the trustees spent $15 million to purchase the property. Jefferson had owned it as part of his plantation, but it was sold off after his death. In the 20th century, its farmhouses were divided into apartments for many University of Virginia students. TJF officials had long considered the property an eyesore, and planned to acquire it when it became available.\nArchitecture.\nIn 1784, Thomas Jefferson left America to travel and explore the streets of France, which influenced his taste in architecture. He was mainly influenced by the neoclassical style commonly seen in French architecture, which is the reason Monticello is designed in a classical revival style.\nJefferson had also been interested in the Pantheon, even though he was never able to make the trip to Rome to see it in person. Not only did the temple's facade influence Monticello, but also the Rotunda, which is a library found at the University of Virginia. Both buildings have a temple like front replicating the Pantheon facade with large structural columns. This building front is also similar to the Palladian. The back side of the buildings also pays tribute to the Roman temple. Jefferson did this by including a dome shape behind the temple front. After Jefferson resigned from Washington's cabinet, he chose to remodel portions of Monticello. This time he was greatly influenced by the H\u00f4tel de Salm in Paris.\nThe house is similar in appearance to Chiswick House, a Neoclassical house inspired by the architect Andrea Palladio built in 1726\u20131729 in London.\nRepresentation in other media.\nMonticello was featured in Bob Vila's A&amp;E Network production, \"Guide to Historic Homes of America,\" in a tour which included Honeymoon Cottage and the Dome Room, which is open to the public during a limited number of tours each year.\nReplicas.\nIn 2014, S. Prestley Blake constructed a replica of Monticello in Somers, Connecticut. It can be seen on Route 186 also known as Hall Hill Road. In 2019, Blake donated the house to Hillsdale College to serve as a satellite campus for its Blake Center for Faith and Freedom.\nThe entrance pavilion of the Naval Academy Jewish Chapel at Annapolis is modeled on Monticello.\nChamberlin Hall at Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, built in 1962 and modeled on Monticello, serves as the location of the Academy's Middle School.\nCompleted in August 2015, Dallas Baptist University built one of the largest replicas of Monticello, including its entry halls and a dome room. Approximately , it is the home of the Gary Cook School of Leadership, as well as the University Chancellor's offices.\nSaint Paul's Baptist Church located at the corner of East Belt Boulevard and Hull Street Road in Richmond is modeled after Monticello. Originally built by Weatherford Memorial Baptist Church, the building was donated to St Paul's when Weatherford Memorial disbanded in the early 2000s.\nPi Kappa Alpha's Memorial Headquarters, opened in 1988, is located in the TPC Southwind development in Memphis, Tennessee and was inspired by the architecture of Monticello.\nPerrot Library (1931), Old Greenwich, Connecticut, was inspired by Jeffersonian architecture and Monticello.\nThe exterior of University of the Cumberlands' Ward and Regina Correll Science Complex is also a replica of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello mansion. The $1 million expansion of the Science Complex was started in May 2007 and classes began in January 2009.\nLegacy.\nMonticello's image has appeared on U.S. currency and postage stamps. An image of the west front of Monticello by Felix Schlag has been featured on the reverse of the nickel minted since 1938 (with a brief interruption in 2004 and 2005, when designs of the Westward Journey series appeared instead). It was also used as the title for the 2015 play \"Jefferson's Garden\", which centered on his life.\nMonticello also appeared on the reverse of the two-dollar bill from 1928 to 1966, when the bill was discontinued. The bill was reintroduced in 1976 and retains Jefferson's portrait on the obverse but replaced Monticello on the reverse with an engraved modified reproduction of John Trumbull's 1818 painting \"Declaration of Independence\". The gift shop tour ticket booths at Monticello hands out two-dollar bills as change.\nThe 1994 commemorative Thomas Jefferson 250th Anniversary silver dollar features Monticello on the reverse.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The multi-day holiday involves family and friends gathering to pay respects and remember friends and family members who have died. These celebrations can take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember amusing events and anecdotes about the departed. It is widely observed in Mexico, where it largely developed, and is also observed in other places, especially by people of Mexican heritage. The observance falls during the Christian period of Allhallowtide. Some argue that there are Indigenous Mexican or ancient Aztec influences that account for the custom, though others see it as a local expression of the Allhallowtide season that was brought to the region by the Spanish; the Day of the Dead has become a way to remember those forebears of Mexican culture. The Day of the Dead is largely seen as having a festive characteristic. \nTraditions connected with the holiday include honoring the deceased using calaveras and marigold flowers known as , building home altars called with the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these items as gifts for the deceased. The celebration is not solely focused on the dead, as it is also common to give gifts to friends such as candy sugar skulls, to share traditional pan de muerto with family and friends, and to write light-hearted and often irreverent verses in the form of mock epitaphs dedicated to living friends and acquaintances, a literary form known as .\nIn 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.\nOrigins, history, and similarities to other festivities.\nMexican academics are divided on whether the festivity has genuine indigenous pre-Hispanic roots or whether it is a 20th-century rebranded version of a Spanish tradition developed during the presidency of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas to encourage Mexican nationalism through an \"Aztec\" identity. The festivity has become a national symbol in recent decades and it is taught in the nation's school system asserting a native origin. In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.\nViews differ on whether the festivity has indigenous pre-Hispanic roots, whether it is a more modern adaptation of an existing European tradition, or a combination of both as a manifestation of syncretism. The beginning of the Christian observance of Allhallowtide, including All Saints' Day and its vigil, as well as All Souls' Day, is observed on the same days in places like Spain and Southern Europe, and elsewhere in Christendom. Critics of the Native American origin claim that even though pre-Columbian Mexico had traditions that honored the dead, current depictions of the festivity have more in common with European traditions of Danse macabre and their allegories of life and death personified in the human skeleton to remind of the ephemeral nature of life. Over the past decades, however, Mexican academia has increasingly questioned the validity of this assumption, even going as far as calling it a politically motivated fabrication. Historian Elsa Malvido, researcher for the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia (INAH, or National Institute of Anthropology and History) and founder of the institute's Taller de Estudios sobre la Muerte (Workshop of Studies on Death), was the first to do so in the context of her wider research into Mexican attitudes to death and disease across the centuries. Malvido completely discards a native or even syncretic origin arguing that the tradition can be fully traced to Medieval Europe. She highlights the existence of similar traditions on the same day, not just in Spain, but in the rest of Catholic Southern Europe and Latin America such as altars for the dead, sweets in the shape of skulls and bread in the shape of bones.\nAgustin Sanchez Gonzalez has a similar view in his article published in the INAH's bi-monthly journal \"Arqueolog\u00eda Mexicana\". Gonzalez states that, even though the \"indigenous\" narrative became hegemonic, the spirit of the festivity has far more in common with European traditions of Danse macabre and their allegories of life and death personified in the human skeleton to remind us the ephemeral nature of life. He also highlights that in the 19th-century press there was little mention of the Day of the Dead in the sense that we know it today. All there was were long processions to cemeteries, sometimes ending with drunkenness. Elsa Malvido also points to the recent origin of the tradition of \"velar\" or staying up all night with the dead. It resulted from the Reform Laws under the presidency of Benito Juarez which forced family pantheons out of Churches and into civil cemeteries, requiring rich families to have servants guard family possessions displayed at altars.\nThe historian Ricardo P\u00e9rez Montfort has further demonstrated how the ideology known as became more and more closely linked to post-revolutionary official projects whereas Hispanismo was identified with conservative political stances. This exclusive nationalism began to displace all other cultural perspectives, to the point that in the 1930s the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl was officially promoted by the government as a substitute for the Spanish Three Kings tradition, with a person dressed up as the deity offering gifts to poor children.\nIn this context, the Day of the Dead began to be officially isolated from the Catholic Church by the leftist government of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas motivated both by \"indigenismo\" and left-leaning anti-clericalism. Malvido herself goes as far as calling the festivity a \"Cardenist invention\" whereby the Catholic elements are removed and emphasis is laid on indigenous iconography, the focus on death and what Malvido considers to be the cultural invention according to which Mexicans venerate death. Gonzalez explains that Mexican nationalism developed diverse cultural expressions with a seal of tradition but which are essentially social constructs which eventually developed ancestral tones. One of these would be the Catholic D\u00eda de Muertos which, during the 20th century, appropriated the elements of an ancient pagan rite.\nOne key element of the re-developed festivity which appears during this time is \"La Calavera Catrina\" by Mexican lithographer Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada. According to Gonzalez, while Posada is portrayed in current times as the \"restorer\" of Mexico's pre-Hispanic tradition, he was never interested in Native American culture or history. Posada was predominantly interested in drawing scary images which are far closer to those of the European renaissance or the horrors painted by Francisco de Goya in the Spanish War of Independence against Napoleon than to the Mexica tzompantli. The recent trans-Atlantic connection can also be observed in the pervasive use of couplet in allegories of death and the play \"Don Juan Tenorio\" by 19th-century Spanish writer Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla which is represented on this date both in Spain and in Mexico since the early 19th century due to its ghostly apparitions and cemetery scenes.\nOpposing views assert that despite the obvious European influence and clear adoption of symbols and traditions as well as co-option of dates and seasons, there exists some proof of pre-Columbian festivities that were similar in spirit if not substance, with the Aztec people having at least six celebrations during the year that were similar to Day of the Dead, the closest one being Quecholli, a celebration that honored Mixc\u00f3atl (the god of war) and was celebrated between October 20 and November 8. This celebration included elements such as the placement of altars with food (tamales) near the burying grounds of warriors to help them in their journey to the afterlife. Influential Mexican poet and Nobel prize laureate Octavio Paz strongly supported the syncretic view of the D\u00eda de Muertos tradition being a continuity of ancient Aztec festivals celebrating death, as is most evident in the chapter \"All Saints, Day of the Dead\" of his 1950 book-length essay \"The Labyrinth of Solitude\".\nRuben C. Cordova emphasizes the zeal with which the Spanish attempted to extinguish indigenous religious beliefs and practices, such that it is often difficult to reconstruct their main features. Over time, indigenous converts became extremely devout Catholics. As Mexico modernized, the traditional practices that the Spanish had brought to the Americas survived most robustly in rural and less affluent communities, which had high concentrations of indigenous and mestizo populations. Thus archaic Spanish religious practices in marginal areas came to be mistakenly regarded as the \"pure\" core of primarily \"indigenous\" Day of the Dead festivities.\nThe Aztecs devoted two twenty-day months in their ritual calendar to the dead: the ninth and tenth months, which were for children and adults, respectively. Cordova argues that some recollection of these festivals \"was compressed down to two days and cryptically celebrated within the Catholic liturgical calendar\", which is why, in Mexico, \"unlike other Latin American countries with Day of the Dead traditions \u2014 All Saints' Day is dedicated to children, and All Souls' Day is dedicated to adults.\"\u00a0\nHe also\u00a0notes that the same object, such as a stone skull carved by the Aztecs, would have different meanings in different religious contexts. For the Aztecs, bones\u2014and skulls in particular\u2014were reservoirs of enormous sacred power. A stone skull could evoke sacrifice, and the skull racks where the skulls of sacrificed captives were displayed. The Spanish could take an Aztec skull and repurpose it by placing it on a holy water font, or under a cross in a cemetery, whereby it would be transformed into a memento mori.\nRegardless of its origin, the festivity has become a national symbol in Mexico and as such is taught in the nation's school system, typically asserting a native origin. It is also a school holiday nationwide.\nObservance in Mexico.\nAltars and installations in Mexico City museums and public spaces.\nIn the 2015 James Bond film \"Spectre\", the opening sequence features a Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City. At the time, no such parade took place in Mexico City; one year later, due to the interest in the film and the government desire to promote the Mexican culture, the federal and local authorities decided to organize an actual parade through Paseo de la Reforma and Centro Historico on October 29, 2016, which was attended by 250,000 people. This could be seen as an example of the pizza effect. The idea of a massive celebration was also popularized in the Disney Pixar movie \"Coco\".\nA number of Mexico City's museums and public spaces have played an important part in developing and promoting urban Day of the Dead traditions through altars and installations. These notable organizations include: Anahuacalli, The Frida Kahlo Museum, The Museum of Popular Cultures, The Dolores Olmedo Museum, The Museum of the First Printing Press, and The Cloister of Sor Juana. From turn of the millennium until the imposition of the James Bond-inspired parade, remarkable large-scale installations were created on the Zocalo, Mexico City's central square.\nAltars ().\nDuring D\u00eda de Muertos, the tradition is to build private altars (\"ofrendas\") containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so the souls will hear the prayers and the words of the living directed to them. These altars are often placed at home or in public spaces such as schools and libraries, but it is also common for people to go to cemeteries to place these altars next to the tombs of the departed.\nPlans for the day are made throughout the year, including gathering the goods to be offered to the dead. During the three-day period families usually clean and decorate graves; most visit the cemeteries where their loved ones are buried and decorate their graves with (altars), which often include orange Mexican marigolds (\"Tagetes erecta\") called (originally named , N\u0101huatl for 'twenty flowers'). In modern Mexico the marigold is sometimes called ('Flower of Dead'). These flowers are thought to attract souls of the dead to the offerings. It is also believed the bright petals with a strong scent can guide the souls from cemeteries to their family homes. The common name in English, marigold, is derived from \"Mary's gold\", a name first applied to a similar plant native to Europe, \"Calendula officinalis\".\nToys are brought for dead children (, or 'the little angels'), and bottles of tequila, mezcal or pulque or jars of for adults. Families will also offer trinkets or the deceased's favorite candies on the grave. Some families have in homes, usually with foods such as candied pumpkin, ('bread of dead'), and sugar skulls; and beverages such as . The are left out in the homes as a welcoming gesture for the deceased. Some people believe the spirits of the dead eat the \"spiritual essence\" of the ' food, so though the celebrators eat the food after the festivities, they believe it lacks nutritional value. Pillows and blankets are left out so the deceased can rest after their long journey. In some parts of Mexico, such as the towns of Mixquic, P\u00e1tzcuaro and Janitzio, people spend all night beside the graves of their relatives. In many places, people have picnics at the grave site, as well.\nSome families build altars or small shrines in their homes; these sometimes feature a Christian cross, statues or pictures of the Blessed Virgin Mary, pictures of deceased relatives and other people, scores of candles, and an . Traditionally, families spend some time around the altar, praying and telling anecdotes about the deceased. In some locations, celebrants wear shells on their clothing, so when they dance, the noise will wake up the dead; some will also dress up as the deceased.\nFood.\nDuring Day of the Dead festivities, food is both eaten by living people and given to the spirits of their departed ancestors as ('offerings'). are one of the most common dishes prepared for this day for both purposes.\n and are associated specifically with Day of the Dead. is a type of sweet roll shaped like a bun, topped with sugar, and often decorated with bone-shaped pieces of the same pastry. , or sugar skulls, display colorful designs to represent the vitality and individual personality of the departed.\nIn addition to food, drinks are also important to the tradition of Day of the Dead. Historically, the main alcoholic drink was pulque; today families will commonly drink the favorite beverage of their deceased ancestors. Other drinks associated with the holiday are and , warm, thick, non-alcoholic masa drinks.\n (water of hibiscus) is a popular herbal tea made of the flowers and leaves of the Jamaican hibiscus plant (\"Hibiscus sabdariffa\"), known as in Mexico. It is served cold and quite sweet with a lot of ice. The ruby-red beverage is also known as hibiscus tea in English-speaking countries.\nIn the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, mukbil pollo (p\u00edib chicken) is traditionally prepared on October 31 or November 1, and eaten by the family throughout the following days. It is similar to a big tamale, composed of masa and pork lard, and stuffed with pork, chicken, tomato, garlic, peppers, onions, epazote, achiote, and spices. Once stuffed, the mukbil pollo is bathed in kool sauce, made with meat broth, habanero chili, and corn masa. It is then covered in banana leaves and steamed in an underground oven over the course of several hours. Once cooked, it is dug up and opened to eat.\n\"Calaveras\".\nA common symbol of the holiday is the skull (in Spanish ), which celebrants represent in masks, called (colloquial term for skeleton), and foods such as chocolate or sugar skulls, which are inscribed with the name of the recipient on the forehead. Sugar skulls can be given as gifts to both the living and the dead. Other holiday foods include , a sweet egg bread made in various shapes from plain rounds to skulls, often decorated with white frosting to look like twisted bones.\nIn some parts of the country, especially the larger cities, children in costumes roam the streets, knocking on people's doors for a , a small gift of candies or money; they also ask passersby for it. This custom is similar to that of Halloween's trick-or-treating in the United States, but without the component of mischief to homeowners if no treat is given.\nA distinctive literary form exists within this holiday where people write short poems in traditional rhyming verse, called (lit.\u2009'literary skulls'), which are mocking, light-hearted epitaphs mostly dedicated to friends, classmates, co-workers, or family members (living or dead) but also to public or historical figures, describing interesting habits and attitudes, as well as comedic or absurd anecdotes that use death-related imagery which includes but is not limited to cemeteries, skulls, or the grim reaper, all of this in situations where the dedicatee has an encounter with death itself. This custom originated in the 18th or 19th century after a newspaper published a poem narrating a dream of a cemetery in the future which included the words \"and all of us were dead\", and then proceeding to read the tombstones. Current newspapers dedicate to public figures, with cartoons of skeletons in the style of the famous of Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada, a Mexican illustrator. In modern Mexico, are a staple of the holiday in many institutions and organizations, for example, in public schools, students are encouraged or required to write them as part of the language class.\nPosada's most famous print, (\"The Elegant Skull\"), was likely intended as a criticism of Mexican upper-class women who imitated European fashions. It was first published posthumously in a broadside with a text (not by Posada) that mocked working-class vendors of chickpeas.\nPosada's image of a skeletal figure with a big hat decorated with two ostrich feathers and flowers was elaborated into a full scale figure by Mexican Muralist Diego Rivera in a fresco painted in 1946\u201347. Rivera's Catrina has a simple Tehuana dress and a feather boa, as well as other features that make allusions to the indigenous peoples of Mexico. Through the addition of these indigenous features, Rivera rehabilitated Catrina into a nationalist emblem.\nThe Catrina character has become deeply associated with the Day of the Dead. Catrina figures made of a wide range of materials, as well as people with Catrina costumes, have come to play a prominent role in modern Day of the Dead observances in Mexico and elsewhere. The Catrina phenomenon has in fact gone beyond Day of the Dead, resulting in non-seasonal and even permanent \"Catrinas\", including COVID-19 masks, tattoos, permanently decorated cars, and Catrina-themed artworks. Some artists have even developed a sub-specialization in Catrina imagery.\nTheatrical presentations of \"Don Juan Tenorio\" by Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla (1817\u20131893) are also traditional on this day.\nLocal traditions.\nThe traditions and activities that take place in celebration of the Day of the Dead are not universal, often varying from town to town. For example, in the town of P\u00e1tzcuaro on the Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro in Michoac\u00e1n, the tradition is very different if the deceased is a child rather than an adult. On November 1 of the year after a child's death, the godparents set a table in the parents' home with sweets, fruits, , a cross, a rosary (used to ask the Virgin Mary to pray for them), and candles. This is meant to celebrate the child's life, in respect and appreciation for the parents. There is also dancing with colorful costumes, often with skull-shaped masks and devil masks in the plaza or garden of the town. At midnight on November 2, the people light candles and ride winged boats called (butterflies) to Janitzio, an island in the middle of the lake where there is a cemetery, to honor and celebrate the lives of the dead there.\nIn contrast, the town of Ocotepec, north of Cuernavaca in the State of Morelos, opens its doors to visitors in exchange for (small wax candles) to show respect for the recently deceased. In return, the visitors receive tamales and . This is done only by the owners of the house where someone in the household has died in the previous year. Many people of the surrounding areas arrive early to eat for free and enjoy the elaborate altars set up to receive the visitors.\nAnother unique tradition involving children is (the Dance of the Old Men), where boys and young men dressed like grandfathers crouch and jump in an energetic dance.\nObservances outside of Mexico.\nNorth America.\nUnited States.\nIn many communities in the United States with Mexican residents, Day of the Dead celebrations are very similar to those held in Mexico. In some of these communities, in states such as Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, the celebrations tend to be mostly traditional. The All Souls' Procession has been an annual event since 1990 in Tucson, Arizona. The event combines elements of traditional Day of the Dead celebrations with those of pagan harvest festivals. People wearing masks carry signs honoring the dead and an urn in which people can place slips of paper with prayers on them to be burned. Likewise, Old Town San Diego, California, annually hosts a traditional two-day celebration culminating in a candlelight procession to the historic El Campo Santo Cemetery.\nThe festival also was held annually at historic Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. Sponsored by Forest Hills Educational Trust and the folkloric performance group La Pi\u00f1ata, the Day of the Dead festivities celebrated the cycle of life and death. People brought offerings of flowers, photos, mementos, and food for their departed loved ones, which they placed at an elaborately and colorfully decorated altar. A program of traditional music and dance also accompanied the community event. The Jamaica Plain celebration was discontinued in 2011.\nThe Smithsonian Institution, in collaboration with the University of Texas at El Paso and Second Life, have created a Smithsonian Latino Virtual Museum and accompanying multimedia e-book: \"D\u00eda de los Muertos: Day of the Dead\". The project's website contains some of the text and images which explain the origins of some of the customary core practices related to the Day of the Dead, such as the background beliefs and the (the special altar commemorating one's deceased loved one). The Made For iTunes multimedia e-book version provides additional content, such as further details; additional photo galleries; pop-up profiles of influential Latino artists and cultural figures over the decades; and video clips of interviews with artists who make -themed artwork, explanations and performances of Aztec and other traditional dances, an animation short that explains the customs to children, virtual poetry readings in English and Spanish.\nIn 2021, the Biden-Harris administration celebrated the .\nCalifornia.\nThe celebration of the Day of the Dead in Santa Ana, California has grown to two large events with the creation of an event held at the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center for the first time on November 1, 2015. The city also holds the largest annual in southern California, which began in 2002. \nIn other communities, interactions between Mexican traditions and American culture are resulting in celebrations in which Mexican traditions are being extended to make artistic or sometimes political statements. For example, in Los Angeles, California, the Self Help Graphics &amp; Art Mexican-American cultural center presents an annual Day of the Dead celebration that includes both traditional and political elements, such as altars to honor the victims of the Iraq War, highlighting the high casualty rate among Latino soldiers. An updated, intercultural version of the Day of the Dead is also evolving at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. There, in a mixture of Native Californian art, Mexican traditions and Hollywood hip, conventional altars are set up side by side with altars to Jayne Mansfield and Johnny Ramone. Colorful native dancers and music intermix with performance artists, while others play on traditional themes.\nSimilar traditional and intercultural updating of Mexican celebrations are held in San Francisco. For example, the Galer\u00eda de la Raza, SomArts Cultural Center, Mission Cultural Center, de Young Museum and altars at Garfield Square by the Marigold Project. Oakland is home to in the Fruitvale district. has a shop offering handcrafted Mexican gifts and a museum devoted to Day of the Dead artifacts and serves as the hub of the annual festival which occurs the last weekend of October. Here, a mix of several Mexican traditions come together with traditional Aztec dancers, regional Mexican music, and other Mexican artisans to celebrate the day.\nIn San Diego, a city that borders Mexico, the celebrations range across the entire county. All the way up at the most northern part of the county, Oceanside celebrates their annual event which includes community and family altars built around the Oceanside Civic Center and Pier View Way, as well as events at the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia. In the more central area of San Diego, City Heights celebrates through a public festival in Jeremy Henwood Memorial Park that includes at least 35 altars, lowriders, and entertainment, all for free. Down in Chula Vista, they celebrate the tradition through a movie night at Third and Davidson streets where they will be screening \"Coco\". This movie night also consists of a community altar, an altar contest, a contest, as well as lots of music, food, and vendors.\nEurope.\nCzech Republic.\nAs part of a promotion by the Mexican embassy in Prague, since the late 20th century, some local citizens join in a Mexican-style Day of the Dead. A theater group conducts events involving candles, masks, and make-up using luminous paint in the form of sugar skulls.\nItaly.\nIn Italy, November 2 is All Souls' Day and is colloquially known as Day of the Dead or . While many regional nuances exist, celebrations generally consist of placing flowers at cemeteries and family burial sites and speaking to deceased relatives. Some traditions also include lighting a red candle or on the window sills at sunset and laying out a table of food for deceased relatives who will come to visit. Like other Day of the Dead traditions around the world, Giorno dei Morti is a day dedicated to honoring the lives of those who have died. Additionally, it is a tradition that teaches children not to be afraid of death.\nIn Sicily, families celebrate a long-held Day of the Dead tradition called The Festival of the Dead or . On the eve of November 1, , or All Saints' Day, older family members act as the , or spirits of deceased family members, who sneak into the home and hide sweets and gifts for their young descendants to awake to. On the morning of November 2, children begin the day by hunting to find the gifts in shoes or a special wicker basket of the dead called or , which typically consist of various sweets, small toys, boned-shaped almond flavored cookies called , sugar dolls called , and fruit, vegetable, and ghoul-shaped marzipan treats called . The , thought to be an Arabic cultural import, are often found in the shapes of folkloric characters who represent humanized versions of the souls of the dead. Eating the sugar dolls reflects the idea of the individual absorbing the dead and, in doing so, bringing the dead back to life within themselves on November 2. After gifts are shared and breakfast is enjoyed, the whole family will often visit the cemetery or burial site bearing flowers. They will light candles and play amongst the graves to thank the deceased for the gifts, before enjoying a hearty feast. The tradition holds that the spirits of the deceased will remain with the family to enjoy a day of feasting and merriment.\nSicilian author Andrea Camilleri recounts his experience as boy, as well as the negative cultural impact that WWII era American influence had on the long-held tradition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...Every Sicilian house where there was a little boy was populated with dead familiar to him.\u00a0Not ghosts with white linz\u00f2lo and with the scrunch of chains, mind you, not those that are frightening, but such and as they were seen in the photographs exhibited in the living room, worn, the occasional half smile printed on the face, the good ironed dress in a workmanlike manner, they made no difference with the living.\u00a0We Nicareddri, before going to bed, put a wicker basket under the bed (the size varied according to the money there was in the family) that at night the dear dead would fill with sweets and gifts that we would find on the 2nd morning upon awakening...After a restless sleep we woke up at dawn to go hunting. Because the dead wanted to play with us, to give us fun, and therefore they didn't put the basket back where they had found it, but went to hide it carefully, we had to look for it...The toys were tin trains, wooden toy cars, rag dolls, wooden cubes that formed landscapes...On November 2nd we returned the visit that the dead had paid us the day before: it was not a ritual, but an affectionate custom.\u00a0Then, in 1943, with the American soldiers the Christmas tree arrived and slowly, year after year, the dead lost their way to the houses where they were waiting for them, happy and awake until the end, the children or the children of the children...Pity. We had lost the possibility of touching, materially, that thread that binds our personal history to that of those who had preceded us...\nFood plays an important part of Italy's day of the dead tradition, with various regional treats being used as offerings to the dead on their journey to the afterlife. In Tuscany and Milan the or \"bread of the dead\" is said to be the characteristic offering. In northern Apulia, a wheat growing region, a sweet dish for the Day of the Dead is or \"Grains of the Dead\". or \"fava beans of the dead\" is another dish for the day found widespread through Italy. , suitably elongated and frosted \"bones of the dead\" are sweets found in Apulia and Sicily. In Sicily, families enjoy special day of the dead cakes and cookies that are made into symbolic shapes such as skulls and finger bones. The \"sweets of the dead\" are a marzipan treats called . On the night of November 1, Sicilian parents and grandparents traditionally buy Frutta di Martorana to gift to children on November 2.\nIn addition to visiting their own family members, some people pay respects to those without a family. Some Italians take it upon themselves to adopt centuries-old unclaimed bodies and give them offerings like money or jewelry as a way to ease their pain and ask for favors.\nAsia and Oceania.\nMexican-style Day of the Dead celebrations occur in major cities in Australia, Fiji, and Indonesia, most organized by Mexican communities. Additionally, an independent annual celebration is held in Wellington, New Zealand, complete with altars celebrating the deceased with flowers and gifts.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines and , All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day, are celebrated following with the Catholic tradition. Filipinos traditionally observe these days by visiting the family dead to clean and repair their tombs, just as is done in Mexico. Offerings of prayers, flowers, candles, and food, while Chinese Filipinos additionally burn joss sticks and joss paper (). Many also spend the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the cemetery, having feasts and merriment. Due the cultural connections of the Philippines and Mexico with links going back to the Spanish Empire, they share some of the aspects of the practices done in the celebration.\nSimilar or related festivities.\nAmericas.\nBelize.\nIn Belize, Day of the Dead is practiced by people of the Yucatec Maya ethnicity. The celebration is known as which means 'food for the souls' in their language. Altars are constructed and decorated with food, drinks, candies, and candles put on them.\nBolivia.\n\"D\u00eda de las \u00d1atitas\" (\"Day of the Skulls\") is a festival celebrated in La Paz, Bolivia, at the beginning of November after the celebrations of All Saints. In pre-Columbian times indigenous Andeans had a tradition of sharing a day with the bones of their ancestors on the third year after burial. Today families keep only the skulls for such rituals, known as \u00f1atitas. Traditionally, the skulls of family members are kept at home to watch over the family and protect them during the year. On November 9, the family crowns the skulls with fresh flowers, sometimes also dressing them in various garments, and making offerings of cigarettes, coca leaves, alcohol, and various other items in thanks for the year's protection. The skulls are also sometimes taken to the central cemetery in La Paz for a special Mass and blessing.\nBrazil.\nThe Brazilian public holiday of \"Dia de Finados\", \"Dia dos Mortos\" or \"Dia dos Fi\u00e9is Defuntos\" (Portuguese: \"Day of the Dead\" or \"Day of the Faithful Deceased\") is celebrated on November 2. Similar to other Day of the Dead celebrations, people go to cemeteries and churches with flowers and candles and offer prayers. The celebration is intended as a positive honoring of the dead. Memorializing the dead draws from indigenous and European Catholic origins.\nCosta Rica.\nCosta Rica celebrates D\u00eda De Los Muertos on November 2. The day is also called \"D\u00eda de Todos Santos\" (All Saints Day) and \"D\u00eda de Todos Almas\" (All Souls' Day). Catholic masses are celebrated and people visit their loved ones' graves to decorate them with flowers and candles.\nEcuador.\nIn Ecuador the Day of the Dead is observed to some extent by all parts of society, though it is especially important to the indigenous Kichwa peoples, who make up an estimated quarter of the population. \"Indigena\" families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and lost loved ones. Ceremonial foods include \"colada morada\", a spiced fruit porridge that derives its deep purple color from the Andean blackberry and purple maize. This is typically consumed with \"guaguas de pan\", bread shaped like infants (or, more generally, people), though variations include many pigs\u2014the latter being traditional to the city of Loja. The bread, which is wheat flour-based today, but was made with masa in the Pre-Columbian era, can be made savory with cheese inside or sweet with a filling of guava paste. These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well, where food establishments add both \"colada morada\" and \"guaguas de pan\" to their menus for the season. Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves of the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional foods, too.\nGuatemala.\nGuatemalan celebrations of the Day of the Dead, on November 1, are highlighted by the construction and flying of giant kites. It is customary to fly kites to help the spirits find their way back to Earth. A few kites have notes for the dead attached to the strings of the kites. The kites are used as a kind of telecommunication to heaven. A big event also is the consumption of \"fiambre\", which is made only for this day during the year. In addition to the traditional visits to grave sites of ancestors, the tombs and graves are decorated with flowers, candles, and food for the dead. In a few towns, Guatemalans repair and repaint the cemetery with vibrant colors to bring the cemetery to life. They fix things that have gotten damaged over the years or just simply need a touch-up, such as wooden grave cross markers. They also lay flower wreaths on the graves. Some families have picnics in the cemetery.\nHonduras.\nIn Honduras, November 2nd is widely commemorated as the Day of the Dead, a date on which a special mass is celebrated and families visit cemeteries, decorate graves, and bring flowers, candles, or other objects for their deceased loved ones Some Honduran traditions state that relatives clean and adorn graves, clean cemeteries, and bring wreaths or arrangements. This celebration in the Honduran context is more focused in cemeteries than homes. In some regions of the country during November 1st, white flowers are placed especially for deceased children, as a sign of the purity of their souls. In some cases, music or entertainment is brought to the cemetery as part of the collective or communal visit. Similar to other contexts, these customs have a strong Christian-Catholic component combined with popular elements that may have local pre-Columbian roots.\nPeru.\nIt is common for Peruvians to visit the cemetery, play music and bring flowers to decorate the graves of dead relatives.\nEurope.\nSouthern Italy and Sicily.\nA traditional biscotti-type cookie, \"ossa di morto\" or \"bones of the dead\" are made and placed in shoes once worn by dead relatives.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The species have enormous flowers, the buds rising from the ground or directly from the lower stems of their host plants; one species has the largest flower in the world. Plants of the World Online lists up to 41 species from this genus; all of them are found in Southeast Asia.\nWestern Europeans first learned about plants of this genus from French surgeon and naturalist Louis Deschamps when he was in Java between 1791 and 1794; but his notes and illustrations were seized by the British in 1798 and were not available to Western scientists until 1861. The first British person to see one was Joseph Arnold in 1818, in the Indonesia rainforest in Bengkulu, Sumatra, after a Malay servant working for him discovered a flower and pointed it out to him. The flower, and the genus, was later named after Stamford Raffles, the leader of the expedition and the founder of the British colony of Singapore.\nThe following is from Arnold's account of discovering the flower:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Here I rejoice to tell you I happened to meet with what I consider as the greatest prodigy of the vegetable world. I had ventured some way from the party, when one of the Malay servants came running to me ... To tell you the truth, had I been alone, and had there been no witnesses, I should, I think, have been fearful of mentioning the dimensions of this flower, so much does it exceed every flower I have seen or heard of.\nVivid contemporary accounts documenting some of the most inaccessible species of Rafflesia are described in the popular science book, \"Pathless Forest: The Quest to Save the World's Largest Flowers\", by botanist Chris Thorogood based at the University of Oxford Botanic Garden.\nDescription.\nThe plant has no stems, leaves or roots. It is a holoparasite of vines in the genus \"Tetrastigma\" (a plant in the Vitaceae, the grape vine family), spreading its absorptive organ, the haustorium, inside the tissue of the vine. The only part of the plant that can be seen outside the host vine is the five-petalled flower. In some species, such as \"Rafflesia arnoldii\", the flower may be over in diameter, and weigh up to . A \"Rafflesia\" that bloomed in West Sumatra in January 2020 was measured to be in diameter, the largest flower ever recorded\u2014 wider than the flower reported as the largest in 2017. Even one of the smallest species, \"R. baletei\", has diameter flowers. A team of morphologists and geneticists headed by Prof. Charles Davis of Harvard has discovered an important difference between \"Rafflesia\" spp. and the very similar \"Sapria\" spp. In both genera the petals are now described as sepals (or more correctly as \"petaloid tepals\") instead of vaguely defined \"perigon lobes\". In \"Sapria\", the \"diaphragm\" is a true corona while in \"Rafflesia\" the diaphragm is made up of adnate petals to form a dome, the true corona being greatly reduced and fused with the adnate petals.\nThe flowers look and smell like rotting flesh. The foul odour attracts insects such as carrion flies, which transport pollen from male to female flowers. Most species are dioecious, having separate male and female flowers, but a few (\"R. baletei\" and \"R. verrucosa\") have hermaphroditic flowers. Little is known about seed dispersal. Tree shrews and other forest mammals eat the fruits. The extremely tiny seeds have extremely tiny elaiosomes, and are thus most likely dispersed by ants. The seeds are packed into berries, each of which contains hundreds of thousands of seeds.\nBecause \"Amorphophallus\" has the world's largest unbranched inflorescence, it is sometimes mistakenly credited as having the world's largest flower. Both \"Rafflesia\" and \"Amorphophallus\" are flowering plants, but they are unrelated to each other. \"Rafflesia arnoldii\" has the largest \"single\" flower of any flowering plant, at least in terms of weight. \"Amorphophallus titanum\" has the largest \"unbranched\" inflorescence, while the talipot palm (\"Corypha umbraculifera\") forms the largest \"branched\" inflorescence, containing thousands of flowers; the talipot is monocarpic, meaning the individual plants die after flowering.\n\"Rafflesia\" are also remarkable for showing a large horizontal transfer of genes from their host plants. This is well known among bacteria, but not higher organisms. It occurs in the mitochondria (originally derived from bacteria) found within the cells of \"Rafflesia\"; these appear to have exchanged genes with the mitochondria of the host tissue.\nNames.\nIn Indonesian and Malaysian, it is known as \"padma\". The species \"R. arnoldii\" is known as \"padma raksasa\" (\"giant \"padma\"\"). In Javanese it is called \"patma\". In Malay, the 'normal' \"R. hasseltii\" is vernacularly known as \"pakma\", \"patma\" or \"ambai-ambai\", whereas the goliath \"R. arnoldii\" from Sumatra is called \"krubut\" or \"kerubut\", 'great flower'. The words \"padma\", \"pakma\" or \"patma\" originate etymologically from the word \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e (\"padma\"), Sanskrit for 'lotus'.\nIn English \"Rafflesia\" is known as the stinking corpse lily. It is also known as \"corpse flower\", or \"bunga bangkai\" in Indonesian, a name that more commonly refers to the titan arum (\"Amorphophallus titanum\") of the family Araceae. The type species \"arnoldii\" has been called the \"monster flower\".\nTaxonomy.\nRobert Brown introduced the genus \"Rafflesia\" to the wider scientific world in a presentation before the Linnean Society of London in June 1820, but his scientific paper on the subject was only published in late 1821.\nIn 1999 the British botanical historian David Mabberley pointed out that the genus \"Rafflesia\" was first validated by an anonymous report on the meeting published in the \"Annals of Philosophy\" in September 1820 (the name was technically an unpublished \"nomen nudum\" until this publication). Mabberley claimed the author was Samuel Frederick Gray. However, as that is nowhere stated in the \"Annals\", per Article 46.8 of the code of ICBN, Mabberley was wrong to formally ascribe the validation to Gray. The validation of the name was thus attributed to one Thomas Thomson, the editor of the \"Annals\" in 1820, by the IPNI. Mabberley admitted his error in 2017. This Thomson was not the botanist Thomas Thomson, who was three years old in 1820, but his identically named father, a chemist.\nEvolution and phylogeny.\nComparison of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of \"Rafflesia\" with other angiosperm mtDNA indicated this parasite evolved from photosynthetic plants of the order Malpighiales. Another 2004 study confirmed this result using both mtDNA and nuclear DNA sequences, and showed the three other groups traditionally classified in Rafflesiaceae were unrelated. A 2007 study more specifically found \"Rafflesia\" and its relatives to be embedded within the family Euphorbiaceae as traditionally circumscribed, which was surprising, as members of that family typically have very small flowers. According to their analysis, the rate of flower size evolution was more or less constant throughout the family except at the origin of Rafflesiaceae, where the flowers rapidly evolved to become much larger before reverting to the slower rate of change.\nTo maintain monophyletic families, in 2016 the APG IV system separated the family Peraceae from the Euphorbiaceae. A summary cladogram is shown below, with family placements in the APG IV system.\nA 2010 molecular phylogenetic study of 18 species of \"Rafflesia\" found that they fell into four clear-cut geographically defined groups:\nHowever, the clear monophyly of the four geographical clades does not correspond to any clear difference in appearance. There is no consistency within the clades in the size of flowers, or the presence or absence of white warts; species in different clades resemble one another more than they do some other species within the same clade. Homoplasy \u2013 repeatedly gaining or losing traits \u2013 seems to be the rule within \"Rafflesia\".\nAccepted species.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of October\u00a02020[ [update]], Plants of the World Online accepted the following species:\nLoss of the chloroplast genome.\nResearch published in 2014 revealed that one Philippine \"Rafflesia\" species from the island of Luzon, \"R. lagascae\" (a synonym of \"R. manillana\"), may have lost the genome of its chloroplast and it is speculated that the loss happened due to the parasitic lifestyle of the plant.\nDistribution.\nMalay Peninsula.\nRafflesia can be found along the area of Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand in the Malay Peninsula.\nMalaysia.\nIn Peninsular Malaysia, the flower can be found in few states, such as Kelantan, Pahang, Perak and Terengganu. In Perak, three species of the flower can be found in Royal Belum state park and Gerik forest reserve of which are \"Rafflesia kerrii\", \"Rafflesia cantleyi\" and \"Rafflesia azlanii\". \"Rafflesia azlanii\" was named after the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Azlan Shah. Meanwhile, two species of the flower hosted by \"Tetrastigma Planch\" can be found in three location in Kelantan. The \"Rafflesia cantleyi\" species can be found in Ulut Sat and Chabang Tongkat while \"Rafflesia kerrii\" can be found in Lojing. Furthermore, two locations in Pahang where this flower can be found are Lembah Benum forest reserve and Lata Jarum. For Terengganu, the flower of \"Rafflesia cantleyi\" species can be found in Kuala Berang. A flower has been found in this area hanging on the root of its host three metres above the ground, unlike the common flowers found on the ground roots.\nThe locations of these flowers are turned into tourist attractions for biodiversity lovers and hikers and helps to generate income for the local people.\nThailand.\nIn Thailand \"Rafflesia\" can be observed in Khao Sok National Park where the flowers are numbered and monitored by the park rangers.\nGreater Sunda Islands.\nSumatra.\n\"Rafflesia\" species in Sumatra are mostly found in the Western part of Barisan Mountains, with the exception of \"R. hasseltii\" which can also be found in Bukit Tigapuluh National Park and other parts of Jambi. \"Rafflesia arnoldii\" has the widest geographical distribution, ranging from Mount Leuser National Park in Aceh to the sections of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in Lampung.\nJava.\n\"R. zollingeriana\" is the endemic species of Java, with limited population in Meru Betiri National Park, East Java. In West Java, Gede Pangrango National Park and Mount Salak is a known habitat for \"R.rochussenii\", while the species of \"R. patma\" can be found in Pangandaran and Nusakambangan Nature Reserve.\nBorneo.\nSpecies native to Borneo include \"R. arnoldii\", \"R. cantleyi\", \"R. hasseltii\", \"R. keithii\", \"R. kerrii\", \"R. pricei\", \"R. tengku-adlinii\" and \"R. tuan-mudae\". \"R. arnoldii\" boasts the world's largest single bloom.\n\"R. keithii\" is an endemic species in Sabah and the largest among the three species of Rafflesia found in Sabah. The flower size is between 60\u00a0cm to 80\u00a0cm. Due to its size, the flower is generally found on the forest floor growing on the underground stem or root of \"Tetrastigma lanceolarium\". \"R. keithii\" can be mostly found around the area of Poring, Sabah.\nMindanao species.\nThe Mindanao species is known as \"Rafflesia schadenbergiana\", after the naturalist Alexander Schadenberg, who first discovered the species at the foothills of Mount Apo in 1882. With a flower of nearly a meter, it is close to the size of a seated child. On Mindanao, the species has been seen in Davao del Sur, South Cotabato and Mount Kitanglad in Bukidnon. \"R. mira\" and \"R. magnifica\" are two names for a single species. Both were discovered at Mount Candalaga in Maragusan, Compostela Valley. The two forms differ in size measurements in which the scientific description of \"R. magnifica\" came from measurements of flowers in full bloom while that of \"R. mira\" was from photographs of nearly dead samples. The medium-sized \"R. mira\" flowers measure about half a meter in diameter and they have round or elliptic perigone wart. The third species on Mindanao is the \"R. mixta\" which has only been found so far in the town of Mainit, Surigao del Norte. It shows a combination of three features of Philippine \"Rafflesia\", namely: the shape and size of the conical process in \"R. schadenbergiana\", the floral size and sparsely distributed perigone warts of \"R. speciosa\", and the overall resemblance, floral size, faint scent, diaphragm and ramenta morphology of \"R. mira\". A fourth species is \"Rafflesia verrucosa\" which is found only in Mount Kampalili in Davao Oriental Province.\nEcology.\nSpecies of \"Rafflesia\" are all thought to be holoparasites of lianas of the genus \"Tetrastigma\", vines which belong to the Vitaceae, the family of the grape vines. They are thus, in a way, hyperparasites, because \"Tetrastigma\" are themselves, in a way, structural parasites of the trees they use to climb up to the light. \"Rafflesia\" appear to be species-specific, with each \"Rafflesia\" species naturally only growing on one to three species of \"Tetrastigma\". Of the 57 known species of \"Tetrastigma\", only ten are known to be host plants. Of the 30 odd species of \"Rafflesia\", the host plants are only known from about half of the species. A certain species of \"Tetrastigma\" is very popular among \"Rafflesia\": \"T. tuberculatum\" is a host plant for at least 15 species, and only two Philippine species are not known to infect it. \"T. papillosum\" and \"T. diepenhorstii\" both host at least two species. The flowers may bud from different locations; \"R. cantleyi\" flowers from the vine some two meters from the ground,\n whereas \"R. zollingeriana\" always buds out of the roots and appears out of the ground.\nThe gender ratio may be skewed. In \"R. lobata\" there are approximately nine male flowers for every female flower. Rarely are there flowers of both sexes at one location to ensure pollination and thus sexual reproduction. This may not matter: female flowers usually form fruit anyway and may thus be agamospermous. Flowering is relatively constant, and sites may continue to flower for decades.\nIn \"Rafflesia arnoldii\" the flowers are visited by the flies \"Drosophila colorata\", \"Chrysomya megacephala\" and \"Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis\". Black ants of the genus \"Euprenolepis\" may feed on the developing flower buds, perhaps killing them. Mammals which are known to eat the flowers are the Javan treeshrew \"Tupaia javanica\" and the porcupine \"Hystrix javanica\". Mammals which have been recorded destroying the buds or flowers, often simply by stepping on and crushing them, are: pigs (\"Sus scrofa\"), wild cats (\"Prionailurus bengalensis\"), rusa (\"Cervus timorensis\"), muntjak (\"Muntiacus muntjak\") and banteng (\"Bos javanicus\").\nUses.\nIn Thailand the buds and flowers of \"R. kerrii\" are considered a delicacy. They are also harvested for herbalism, a concoction is believed to act as a sexual stimulant and to help for fever or backache. In the Philippines the plants are also used in folk herbalism, but the flowers are also fed to swine as fodder. On Java the buds of \"R. zollingeriana\" are harvested and dried for use in \"jamu\", the ancient traditional herbalism of the island. It is unknown for what the buds are supposed to be good for; \"jamu\" concoctions are often complex mixtures and often are supposed to help with sexual prowess.\nThese plants also have some economic use in attracting ecotourists.\nResearch in Malaysia and Indonesia has made it possible to propagate the species for use in horticulture, with the famous Bogor Botanical Garden growing the first plants in the 1850s using grafts of infected vines. The Malaysian biologist Jamili Nais was the first to propagate the plants using the seeds around the year 2000.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its aim is to natively integrate mathematical formulae into World Wide Web pages and other documents. It is part of HTML5 and standardised by ISO/IEC since 2015.\nHistory.\nFollowing some experiments in the Arena browser based on proposals for mathematical markup in HTML, MathML\u00a01 was released as a W3C recommendation in April 1998 as the first XML language to be recommended by the W3C. Version 1.01 of the format was released in July 1999 and version 2.0 appeared in February 2001. Implementations of the specification appeared in Amaya 1.1, Mozilla 1.0 and Opera 9.5. In October 2003, the second edition of MathML Version 2.0 was published as the final release by the W3C Math Working Group.\nMathML was originally designed before the finalization of XML namespaces. However, it was assigned a namespace immediately after the Namespace Recommendation was completed, and for XML use, the elements should be in the namespace with namespace URL \"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\". When MathML is used in HTML (as opposed to XML) this namespace is automatically inferred by the HTML parser and need not be specified in the document.\nMathML version 3.\nVersion 3 of the MathML specification was released as a W3C recommendation on 20 October 2010. A recommendation of \"A MathML for CSS Profile\" was later released on 7 June 2011; this is a subset of MathML suitable for CSS formatting. Another subset, \"Strict Content MathML\", provides a subset of content MathML with a uniform structure and is designed to be compatible with OpenMath. Other content elements are defined in terms of a transformation to the strict subset. New content elements include which associates bound variables () to expressions, for example a summation index. The new element allows structure sharing.\nThe development of MathML 3.0 went through a number of stages. In June 2006, the W3C rechartered the MathML Working Group to produce a MathML 3 Recommendation until February 2008, and in November 2008 extended the charter to April 2010. A sixth Working Draft of the MathML 3 revision was published in June 2009. On 10 August 2010 version 3 graduated to become a \"Proposed Recommendation\" rather than a draft. An implementation of MathML 2 landed in WebKit around this same time, with a Chromium implementation following a couple of years later, although that implementation was removed from Chromium after less than a year.\nThe Second Edition of MathML 3.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on 10 April 2014. The specification was approved as an ISO/IEC international standard 40314:2015 on 23 June 2015. Also in 2015, the MathML Association was founded to support the adoption of the MathML standard. At that time, according to a member of the MathJax team, none of the major browser makers paid any of their developers for any MathML-rendering work; whatever support existed was overwhelmingly the result of unpaid volunteer time/work.\nMathML Core.\nIn August 2021, a new specification called \"MathML Core\" was published, described as the \"core subset of Mathematical Markup Language, or MathML, that is suitable for browser implementation.\" MathML Core set itself apart from MathML 3.0 by including detailed rendering rules and integration with CSS, automated browser support testing resources, and focusing on a fundamental subset of MathML. An implementation was added to Chromium at the beginning of 2023.\nPresentation and semantics.\nMathML deals not only with the \"presentation\" but also the \"meaning\" of formula components (the latter part of MathML is known as \"Content MathML\"). Because the meaning of the equation is preserved separate from the presentation, how the content is communicated can be left up to the user. For example, web pages with MathML embedded in them can be viewed as normal web pages with many browsers, but visually impaired users can also have the same MathML read to them through the use of screen readers (e.g. using the VoiceOver in Safari). JAWS from version 16 onward supports MathML voicing as well as braille output.\nThe quality of rendering of MathML in a browser depends on the installed fonts. The STIX Fonts project have released a comprehensive set of mathematical fonts under an open license. The Cambria Math font supplied with Microsoft Windows had slightly more limited support.\nA valid MathML document typically consists of the XML declaration, DOCTYPE declaration, and document element. The document body then contains MathML expressions which appear in &lt;code class=\"nowrap\" style=\"\"&gt;formula_1 from formula_2 in formula_3);\nThe full specification of MathML entities is closely coordinated with the corresponding specifications for use with HTML and XML in general.\nThus, the expression formula_10 requires two layout elements: one to create the overall horizontal row and one for the superscripted exponent. However, the individual tokens also have to be identified as identifiers (), operators (), or numbers (). Adding the token markup, the full form ends up as\n&lt;mrow&gt;\n &lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mo&gt;&amp;InvisibleTimes;&lt;/mo&gt; &lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;\n &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;&amp;InvisibleTimes;&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;\n &lt;mo&gt;+&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;\n&lt;/mrow&gt;\nA complete document that consists of just the MathML example above, is shown here:\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE math PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD MathML 2.0//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/Math/DTD/mathml2/mathml2.dtd\"&gt;\nformula_11\nContent MathML.\nContent MathML focuses on the semantics, or meaning, of the expression rather than its layout. Central to Content MathML is the element that represents function application. The function being applied is the first child element under , and its operands or parameters are the remaining child elements. Content MathML uses only a few attributes.\nTokens such as identifiers and numbers are individually marked up, much as for Presentation MathML, but with elements such as and . Rather than being merely another type of token, operators are represented by specific elements, whose mathematical semantics are known to MathML: , , etc. There are over a hundred different elements for different functions and operators.\nFor example, represents formula_12 and represents formula_13. The elements representing operators and functions are empty elements, because their operands are the other elements under the containing .\nThe expression formula_10 could be represented as\nformula_15\nContent MathML is nearly isomorphic to expressions in a functional language such as Scheme and other dialects of Lisp. amounts to Scheme's , and the many operator and function elements amount to Scheme functions. With this trivial literal transformation, plus un-tagging the individual tokens, the example above becomes:\n(plus\n (times a (power x 2))\n (times b x)\n c)\nThis reflects the long-known close relationship between XML element structures, and LISP or Scheme S-expressions.\nWikidata annotation in Content MathML.\nAccording to the OM Society, OpenMath Content Dictionaries can be employed as collections of symbols and identifiers with declarations of their semantics\u00a0\u2013 names, descriptions and rules. A 2018 paper presented at the SIGIR conference proposed that the semantic knowledge base Wikidata could be used as an OpenMath Content Dictionary to link semantic elements of a mathematical formula to unique and language-independent Wikidata items.\nExample.\nThe well-known quadratic formula could be represented in Presentation MathML as an expression tree made up from layout elements like or :\nformula_16\nThis example uses the element, which can be used to embed a semantic annotation in non-XML format, for example to store the formula in the format used by an equation editor such as StarMath or the markup using LaTeX syntax. The field is usually a MIME type, although most of the equation encodings don't have such a registration; freeform text may be used in such cases.\nAlthough less compact than other formats, the XML structuring of MathML makes its content widely usable and accessible, allows near-instant display in applications such as web browsers, and facilitates an interpretation of its meaning in mathematical software products. MathML is not intended to be written or edited directly by humans.\nEmbedding MathML in HTML/XHTML files.\nMathML, being XML, can be embedded inside other XML files such as XHTML files using XML namespaces.\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN\"\n \"http://www.w3.org/Math/DTD/mathml2/xhtml-math11-f.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xml:lang=\"en\"&gt;\n &lt;head&gt;\n &lt;title&gt;Example of MathML embedded in an XHTML file&lt;/title&gt;\n &lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"Example of MathML embedded in an XHTML file\"/&gt;\n &lt;/head&gt;\n &lt;body&gt;\n &lt;h1&gt;Example of MathML embedded in an XHTML file&lt;/h1&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n The area of a circle is \n formula_17.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nInline MathML is also supported in HTML5 files. There is no need to specify namespaces as there was in XHTML.\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n &lt;head&gt;\n &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n &lt;title&gt;Example of MathML embedded in an HTML5 file&lt;/title&gt;\n &lt;/head&gt;\n &lt;body&gt;\n &lt;h1&gt;Example of MathML embedded in an HTML5 file&lt;/h1&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n The area of a circle is \n formula_18.\n &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nEmbedding MathML in OpenDocument Office Suite files.\nMathML is natively supported within the ISO standardised OpenDocument Format, which is the default office suite file format used in LibreOffice, Collabora Online and others, these have the filename extensions .odt, .ods, and .odp. The specific XML element &lt;math:math&gt; serves as a container for the MathML content, ensuring it is correctly interpreted within the OpenDocument framework.\nMicrosoft Office does not support MathML natively within its default proprietary XML file formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx): instead, it defines a different XML math syntax derived from older Microsoft Office products. When Microsoft Office saves equations in the OpenDocument Format, it may save equations as uneditable images, losing the ability for the equation to be edited in the future and causing loss of information. This is a Microsoft Office issue, workarounds exist, including: Updating Word, ensuring equations are in the latest format, disabling AutoSave and using the \"Save as MathML\" option.\nOther standards.\nAnother standard called OpenMath that has been more specifically designed (largely by the same people who devised Content MathML) for storing formulae semantically can be used to complement MathML. OpenMath data can be embedded in MathML using the element. OpenMath \"content dictionaries\" can be used to define the meaning of elements. The following would define \"P\"1(\"x\") to be the first Legendre polynomial:\n&lt;apply&gt;\n &lt;csymbol encoding=\"OpenMath\" definitionURL=\"http://www.openmath.org/cd/contrib/cd/orthpoly1.xhtml#legendreP\"&gt;\n &lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;P&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;1&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;\n &lt;/csymbol&gt;\n &lt;ci&gt;x&lt;/ci&gt;\n&lt;/apply&gt;\nOpenMath support is part of the OpenDocument office suite specification, which explicitly allows embedding OpenMath objects alongside MathML. Such that MathML renders the equation and an OpenMath is a semantic representation so that software can compute with it. Office suites that default to using the OpenDocument standard, such as LibreOffice and Collabora Online currently stick to the MathML standard for interoperability, comparatively, OpenMath is not defined in Microsoft's proprietary document formats for docx, pptx, and xlsx.\nThe OMDoc format has been created for markup of larger mathematical structures than formulae, from statements like definitions, theorems, proofs, and examples, to complete theories and even entire text books. Formulae in OMDoc documents can either be written in Content MathML or in OpenMath; for presentation, they are converted to Presentation MathML.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "52315", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52315", "title": "Peter Waldo", "text": "French theologian\nPeter Waldo (; also \"Valdo\", \"Valdes\", \"Waldes\"; , \"de Vaux\"; ; c. 1140 \u2013 c. 1205) was the leader of the Waldensians, a Christian spiritual movement of the Middle Ages.\nThe tradition that his first name was \"Peter\" can only be traced back to the fourteenth century. This has caused some historians, such as Jana Schulman, to see it as likely a later invention. He is considered a Proto-Protestant.\nRelationship with Waldenses.\nPeter Waldo is regarded by many historians, including Jana Schulman, as having founded the Waldensians sometime between 1170 and 1177.\nThere were claims that the Waldensians predated Peter Waldo. In his \"A History of the Vaudois Church\" (1859), Antoine Monastier quotes Bernard, Abbott of Foncald, writing at the end of the 12th century, that the Waldensians arose during the papacy of Lucius. Monastier takes him to mean Lucius II, Pope from 1144 to 1145, and concludes that the Waldenses were active before 1145. Bernard also says that the same Pope Lucius condemned them as heretics, but they were condemned by Pope Lucius III in 1184.\nMonastier also says that Eberard de B\u00e9thune, writing in 1210 (although Monastier says 1160), claimed that the name \"Vaudois\" meant \"valley dwellers\" or those who \"dwell in a vale of sorrow and tears\", and was in use before Peter Waldo.\nA claim persisted until the 19th century that Waldo had not begun any new movement but that he had arisen from a pure Christianity established by the Apostles in the Alps soon after Jesus' ascension, and that Waldo was merely perpetuating this pure faith.\nLife and work.\nMost details of Waldo's life are unknown. Extant sources relate that he was a wealthy clothier and merchant from Lyon and a man of some learning. After establishing himself as a successful merchant, Waldo commissioned monks to create a translated copy of the Bible for him. The clerics from Lyon translated the New Testament into the vernacular \"Romance\" (Franco-Proven\u00e7al). This has caused Waldo to be credited with providing to Europe the first translation of the Bible in a 'modern tongue' outside of Latin.\nThrough reading his Bible and writings of the Church Fathers, Waldo became fascinated with the concepts of purity and perfection. He was also influenced by the movement started by Arnold of Brescia.\". In 1173 in pursuit of purity, he embraced poverty after hearing an itinerant singer perform a song about Saint Alexius. Alexius had given up a large inheritance and a beautiful bride in order to live in poverty like Jesus. Waldo sold all he had, forswore his marriage and home, and put his two young daughters into a convent.\nWaldo began traveling around Lombardy begging and preaching about the value of poverty. The region of Lombardy was a hotbed of religious reform movements at the time, many of which would be later deemed heresies by the Catholic Church. These include the Cathars, the Humiliati, the Albigensians, and the Speronists. As Waldo gathered followers and they determined their own doctrines they shared many features with these other reform movements - to the point that it becomes difficult for historians to determine the origins of many of the religious ideas circulating among them. Unlike the leaders of these other groups Waldo had never joined the Catholic Church's priesthood or any of its religious orders.\nOther events, besides hearing of Saint Alexius, may have also contributed to Waldo's decision to take up poverty and preaching including a rejection of transubstantiation when it was considered a capital crime to do it, and the sudden and unexpected death of a friend during an evening meal. From this point onward he began living a radical Christian life, giving his property over to his wife, while the remainder of his belongings he distributed as alms to the poor. At about this time, Waldo began to preach and teach publicly, based on his ideas of simplicity and poverty, notably that \"No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon.\"\nInspired by his example Waldo began to attract followers and they grew into a community of believers. By 1170 Waldo had gathered a large number of followers, referred to as \"the Poor of Lyons,\" \"the Poor of Lombardy,\" or \"the Poor of God.\" They evangelized their teaching while traveling as peddlers. Often referred to as the Waldensians (or Waldenses), they were distinct from the Albigensians or Cathari. The Waldensian movement was characterized from the beginning by lay preaching, voluntary poverty, and strict adherence to the Bible.\nIn January 1179, Waldo and one of his disciples went to Rome, where they were welcomed by Pope Alexander III and the Roman Curia. They had to explain their faith before a panel of three clergymen, including issues which were then debated within the Church, such as the universal priesthood, the gospel in the vulgate or local language, and the issue of voluntary poverty. The results of the meeting were inconclusive. The pope affirmed the Waldensians' vow of poverty, but forbade them to continue preaching due to their status as laypeople. Waldo and his followers revolted against the ban and increased their preaching and missionary efforts. They continued to gather followers and began proclaiming doctrines at odds with Catholicism - such as the right of all worthy members including women to preach the Scriptures without permission from Church authorities. They also began preaching against Purgatory, prayers for the dead, and indulgences. They were excommunicated by the Catholic Church. By the late 1180s, they were being pursued as heretics. This persecution only increased their preaching against the Roman Catholic Church. The Waldensians developed a doctrine that forbids the use of weapons or of oaths, which led them to refuse any participation in Catholic rituals. The Catholic hierarchy accused them of apostasy.\nWaldo condemned what he considered as papal excesses and Catholic dogmas, including purgatory and transubstantiation. He said that these dogmas were \"the harlot\" from the book of Revelation.\nWaldo's ideas, but not the movement itself, were condemned at the Third Lateran Council in March of the same year. The leaders of the Waldensian movement were not yet excommunicated.\nIn 1180, Waldo composed a profession of faith which is still extant.\nDriven away from Lyon, Waldo and his followers settled in the high valleys of Piedmont, and in France, in the Luberon, as they continued in their pursuit of Christianity based on the New Testament. Finally, Waldo was excommunicated by Pope Lucius III during the synod held at Verona in 1184. The doctrine of the Poor of Lyons was again condemned by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, when they mentioned the group by name for the first time, and declared its principles to be heresy. Fearing suppression from the Church, Waldo's followers fled to the mountainous regions of northern Italy in the Waldensian Evangelical Church.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52316", "revid": "21408729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52316", "title": "Mood disorder", "text": "Mental disorder affecting the mood of an individual or person, over a long period of time\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nA mood disorder, also known as an affective disorder, is any of a group of conditions of mental and behavioral disorder where the main underlying characteristic is a disturbance in the person's mood. The classification is in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD).\nMood disorders fall into seven groups, including: 1. abnormally elevated mood, such as mania or hypomania; 2. depressed mood, of which the best-known and most researched is major depressive disorder (MDD) (alternatively known as clinical depression, unipolar depression, or major depression); and 3. moods which cycle between mania and depression, known as bipolar disorder (BD) (formerly known as manic depression). 4. There are several subtypes of depressive disorders or psychiatric syndromes featuring less severe symptoms such as dysthymic disorder (similar to MDD, but longer lasting and more persistent, though often milder) and cyclothymic disorder (similar to but milder than BD).\nIn some cases, more than one mood disorder can be present in an individual, like bipolar disorder and depressive disorder. Mood disorders may also be substance induced, or occur in response to a medical condition.\nEnglish psychiatrist Henry Maudsley proposed an overarching category of \"affective disorder\". The term was then replaced by \"mood disorder\", as the latter refers to the underlying or longitudinal emotional state, whereas the former refers to the external expression observed by others.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIndividuals with a major depressive episode or major depressive disorder are at increased risk for suicide. Seeking help and treatment from a health professional dramatically reduces the individual's risk for suicide. Studies have demonstrated that asking if a depressed friend or family member has thought of committing suicide is an effective way of identifying those at risk, and it does not \"plant\" the idea or increase an individual's risk for suicide in any way. Epidemiological studies carried out in Europe suggest that, at this moment, roughly 8.5 percent of the world's population have a depressive disorder. No age group seems to be exempt from depression, and studies have found that depression appears in infants as young as 6 months old who have been separated from their mothers. However, there may be differences between cultures in prevalence of MDD due to cultural influences that \"challenge the definition and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders\", as seen in a study by Parker et al. that researched MDD in Chinese individuals. Depressive disorder (also known as depression) is a common mental disorder. It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time. Depression is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life. It can affect all aspects of life. Depression can happen to anyone. People who have lived through abuse, severe losses, or other stressful events are more likely to develop depression.\n Diagnosticians recognize several subtypes or course specifiers:\n* \"Atypical depression\" (\"AD\") is characterized by mood reactivity (paradoxical anhedonia) and positivity, significant weight gain or increased appetite (\"comfort eating\"), excessive sleep or somnolence (hypersomnia), a sensation of heaviness in limbs known as leaden paralysis, and significant social impairment as a consequence of hypersensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection. Difficulties in measuring this subtype have led to questions of its validity and prevalence.\n* \"Melancholic depression\" is characterized by a loss of pleasure (anhedonia) in most or all activities, a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of grief or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early-morning waking, psychomotor retardation, excessive weight loss (not to be confused with anorexia nervosa), or excessive guilt.\n* \"Psychotic major depression\" (\"PMD\"), or simply psychotic depression, is the term for a major depressive episode, in particular of melancholic nature, wherein the patient experiences psychotic symptoms such as delusions or, less commonly, hallucinations. These are most commonly mood-congruent (content coincident with depressive themes).\n* \"Catatonic depression\" is a rare and severe form of major depression involving disturbances of motor behavior and other symptoms. Here, the person is mute and almost stuporous, and either is immobile or exhibits purposeless or even bizarre movements. Catatonic symptoms can also occur in schizophrenia or a manic episode, or can be due to neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n* \"Postpartum depression\" (\"PPD\") is listed as a course specifier in DSM-IV-TR; it refers to the intense, sustained and sometimes disabling depression experienced by women after giving birth. Postpartum depression, which affects 10\u201315% of women, typically sets in within three months of labor, and lasts as long as three months. It is quite common for women to experience a short-term feeling of tiredness and sadness in the first few weeks after giving birth; however, postpartum depression is different because it can cause significant hardship and impaired functioning at home, work, or school as well as, possibly, difficulty in relationships with family members, spouses, or friends, or even problems bonding with the newborn. In the treatment of postpartum major depressive disorders and other unipolar depressions in women who are breastfeeding, nortriptyline, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft) are in general considered to be the preferred medications. Women with personal or family histories of mood disorders are at particularly high risk of developing postpartum depression.\n* \"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder\" (\"PMDD\") is a severe and disabling form of premenstrual syndrome affecting 3\u20138% of menstruating women. The disorder consists of a \"cluster of affective, behavioral and somatic symptoms\" that recur monthly during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. PMDD was added to the list of depressive disorders in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" in 2013. The exact pathogenesis of the disorder is still unclear and is an active research topic. Treatment of PMDD relies largely on antidepressants that modulate serotonin levels in the brain via serotonin reuptake inhibitors as well as ovulation suppression using contraception.\n* \"Seasonal affective disorder\" (\"SAD\"), also known as \"winter depression\" or \"winter blues\", is a specifier. Some people have a seasonal pattern, with depressive episodes coming on in the autumn or winter, and resolving in spring. The diagnosis is made if at least two episodes have occurred in colder months with none at other times over a two-year period or longer. It is commonly hypothesised that people who live at higher latitudes tend to have less sunlight exposure in the winter and therefore experience higher rates of SAD, but the epidemiological support for this proposition is not strong (and latitude is not the only determinant of the amount of sunlight reaching the eyes in winter). It is said that this disorder can be treated by light therapy. SAD is also more prevalent in people who are younger and typically affects more females than males.\n* \"Dysthymia\" is a condition related to unipolar depression, where the same physical and cognitive problems are evident, but they are not as severe and tend to last longer (usually at least 2 years). The treatment of dysthymia is largely the same as for major depression, including antidepressant medications and psychotherapy.\n* \"Double depression\" can be defined as a fairly depressed mood (dysthymia) that lasts for at least two years and is punctuated by periods of major depression.\n*Unspecified Depressive Disorder is designated by the code \"311\" for depressive disorders. In the DSM-5, Unspecified Depressive Disorder encompasses symptoms that are characteristic of depressive disorders and cause significant impairment in functioning, but do not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of any specified depressive disorders. In the DSM-IV, this was called Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.\n*\"Depressive personality disorder\" (DPD) is a controversial psychiatric diagnosis that denotes a personality disorder with depressive features. Originally included in the DSM-II, depressive personality disorder was removed from the DSM-III and DSM-III-R. Recently, it has been reconsidered for reinstatement as a diagnosis. Depressive personality disorder is currently described in Appendix B in the DSM-IV-TR as worthy of further study.\n* \"Recurrent brief depression\" (\"RBD\"), distinguished from major depressive disorder primarily by differences in duration. People with RBD have depressive episodes about once per month, with individual episodes lasting less than two weeks and typically less than 2\u20133 days. Diagnosis of RBD requires that the episodes occur over the span of at least one year and, in female patients, independently of the menstrual cycle. People with clinical depression can develop RBD, and vice versa and both illnesses have similar risks.\n* \"Minor depressive disorder\", or simply minor depression, which refers to a depression that does not meet full criteria for major depression but in which at least two symptoms are present for two weeks.\n* \"Bipolar I\" is distinguished by the presence or history of one or more manic episodes or mixed episodes with or without major depressive episodes. A depressive episode is not required for the diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, but depressive episodes are usually part of the course of the illness.\n* \"Bipolar II\" consisting of recurrent intermittent hypomanic and depressive episodes or mixed episodes.\n* \"Cyclothymia\" is a form of bipolar disorder, consisting of recurrent hypomanic and dysthymic episodes, but no full manic episodes or full major depressive episodes.\n* \"Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified\" (\"BD-NOS\"), sometimes called \"sub-threshold\" bipolar, indicates that the patient has some symptoms in the bipolar spectrum (e.g., manic and depressive symptoms) but does not fully qualify for any of the three formal bipolar DSM-IV diagnoses mentioned above.\nIt is estimated that roughly 1% of the adult population has bipolar I, a further 1% has bipolar II or cyclothymia, and somewhere between 2% and 5% percent have \"sub-threshold\" forms of bipolar disorder. Furthermore, the possibility of getting bipolar disorder when one parent is diagnosed with it is 15\u201330%. Risk, when both parents have it, is 50\u201375%. Also, while with bipolar siblings the risk is 15\u201325%, with identical twins it is about 70%.\nClassification.\nSubstance-induced.\nA mood disorder can be classified as substance-induced if its etiology can be traced to the direct physiologic effects of a psychoactive drug or other chemical substance, or if the development of the mood disorder occurred contemporaneously with substance intoxication or withdrawal. Also, an individual may have a mood disorder coexisting with a substance abuse disorder. Substance-induced mood disorders can have features of a manic, hypomanic, mixed, or depressive episode. Most substances can induce a variety of mood disorders. For example, stimulants such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine can cause manic, hypomanic, mixed, and depressive episodes.\nAlcohol-induced.\nHigh rates of major depressive disorder occur in heavy drinkers and those with alcoholism. Controversy has previously surrounded whether those who abused alcohol and developed depression were self-medicating their pre-existing depression. Recent research has concluded that, while this may be true in some cases, alcohol misuse directly causes the development of depression in a significant number of heavy drinkers. Participants studied were also assessed during stressful events in their lives and measured on a \"Feeling Bad Scale.\" Likewise, they were also assessed on their affiliation with \" deviant \" peers, unemployment, and their partner's substance use and criminal offending. High rates of suicide also occur in those who have alcohol-related problems. It is usually possible to differentiate between alcohol-related depression and depression that is not related to alcohol intake by taking a careful history of the patient. Depression and other mental health problems associated with alcohol misuse may be due to distortion of brain chemistry, as they tend to improve on their own after a period of abstinence.\nBenzodiazepine-induced.\nBenzodiazepines, such as alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam and diazepam, can cause both depression and mania.\nBenzodiazepines are a class of medication commonly used to treat anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia, and are also commonly misused and abused. Those with anxiety, panic and sleep problems commonly have negative emotions and thoughts, depression, suicidal ideations, and often have comorbid depressive disorders. While the anxiolytic and hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines may disappear as tolerance develops, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. These symptoms are \"often interpreted as an exacerbation or as a natural evolution of previous disorders and the chronic use of sedatives is overlooked\". Benzodiazepines do not prevent the development of depression, can exacerbate preexisting depression, can cause depression in those with no history of it, and can lead to suicide attempts. Risk factors for suicide and suicide attempts while using benzodiazepines include high dose prescriptions (even in those not misusing the medications), benzodiazepine intoxication, and underlying depression.\nThe long-term use of benzodiazepines may have a similar effect on the brain as alcohol, and are also implicated in depression. As with alcohol, the effects of benzodiazepine on neurochemistry, such as decreased levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, are believed to be responsible for the increased depression. Additionally, benzodiazepines can indirectly worsen mood by worsening sleep (i.e., benzodiazepine-induced sleep disorder). Like alcohol, benzodiazepines can put people to sleep but, while asleep, they disrupt sleep architecture: decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood). Just as some antidepressants can cause or worsen anxiety in some patients due to being activating, benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression due to being a central nervous system depressant\u2014worsening thinking, concentration and problem solving (i.e., benzodiazepine-induced neurocognitive disorder). However, unlike antidepressants, in which the activating effects usually improve with continued treatment, benzodiazepine-induced depression is unlikely to improve until after stopping the medication.\nIn a long-term follow-up study of patients dependent on benzodiazepines, it was found that 10 people (20%) had taken drug overdoses while on chronic benzodiazepine medication despite only two people ever having had any pre-existing depressive disorder. A year after a gradual withdrawal program, no patients had taken any further overdoses.\nJust as with intoxication and chronic use, benzodiazepine withdrawal can also cause depression. While benzodiazepine-induced depressive disorder may be exacerbated immediately after discontinuation of benzodiazepines, evidence suggests that mood significantly improves after the acute withdrawal period to levels better than during use. Depression resulting from withdrawal from benzodiazepines usually subsides after a few months but in some cases may persist for 6\u201312 months.\nDue to another medical condition.\n\"Mood disorder due to a general medical condition\" is used to describe manic or depressive episodes which occur secondary to a medical condition. There are many medical conditions that can trigger mood episodes, including neurological disorders (e.g. dementias), hearing loss and associated disorders (e.g. tinnitus or hyperacusis), metabolic disorders (e.g. electrolyte disturbances), gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. cirrhosis), endocrine disease (e.g. thyroid abnormalities), cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart attack), pulmonary disease (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cancer, autoimmune diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis), and pregnancy.\nNot otherwise specified.\nMood disorder not otherwise specified (MD-NOS) is a mood disorder that is impairing but does not fit in with any of the other officially specified diagnoses. In the DSM-IV MD-NOS is described as \"any mood disorder that does not meet the criteria for a specific disorder.\" MD-NOS is not used as a clinical description but as a statistical concept for filing purposes. The diagnosis of MD-NOS does not exist in the DSM-5, however the diagnoses of unspecified depressive disorder and unspecified bipolar disorder are in the DSM-5.\nMost cases of MD-NOS represent hybrids between mood and anxiety disorders, such as mixed anxiety-depressive disorder or atypical depression. An example of an instance of MD-NOS is being in minor depression frequently during various intervals, such as once every month or once in three days. There is a risk for MD-NOS not to get noticed, and for that reason not to get treated.\nCauses.\nMeta-analyses show that high scores on the personality domain neuroticism are a strong predictor for the development of mood disorders.\nA depressed mood is a predictable response to certain types of life occurrences, such as loss of status, divorce, or death of a child or spouse. These are events that signal a loss of reproductive ability or potential, or that did so in humans' ancestral environment. A depressed mood can be seen as an adaptive response, in the sense that it causes an individual to turn away from the earlier (and reproductively unsuccessful) modes of behavior.\nA depressed mood is common during illnesses, such as influenza. It has been argued that this is an evolved mechanism that assists the individual in recovering by limiting their physical activity. The occurrence of low-level depression during the winter months, or seasonal affective disorder, may have been adaptive in the past, by limiting physical activity at times when food was scarce. It is argued that humans have retained the instinct to experience low mood during the winter months, even if the availability of food is no longer determined by the weather.\nMuch of what is known about the genetic influence of clinical depression is based upon research that has been done with identical twins. Identical twins have exactly the same genetic code. It has been found that when one identical twin becomes depressed the other will also develop clinical depression approximately 76% of the time. When identical twins are raised apart from each other, they will both become depressed about 67% of the time. Because both twins become depressed at such a high rate, the implication is that there is a strong genetic influence. If it happened that when one twin becomes clinically depressed the other always develops depression, then clinical depression would likely be entirely genetic.\nBipolar disorder is also considered a mood disorder and it is hypothesized that it might be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.\nSex differences.\nMood disorders, specifically stress-related mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, have been shown to have differing rates of diagnosis based on sex. In the United States, women are two times more likely than men to be diagnosed with a stress-related mood disorder. Underlying these sex differences, studies have shown a dysregulation of stress-responsive neuroendocrine function causing an increase in the likelihood of developing these affective disorders. Overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis could provide potential insight into how these sex differences arise. Neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is released from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, stimulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release into the blood stream. From here ACTH triggers the release of glucocorticoids such as cortisol from the adrenal cortex. Cortisol, known as the main stress hormone, creates a negative feedback loop back to the hypothalamus to deactivate the stress response. When a constant stressor is present, the HPA axis remains overactivated and cortisol is constantly produced. This chronic stress is associated with sustained CRF release, resulting in the increased production of anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and serving as a potential mechanism for differences in prevalence between men and women.\nDiagnosis.\n\"DSM-5\".\nThe \"DSM-5\", released in May 2013, separates the mood disorder chapter from the \"DSM-IV-TR\" into two sections: Depressive and related disorders and bipolar and related disorders. Bipolar disorders fall in between depressive disorders and schizophrenia spectrum and related disorders \"in recognition of their place as a bridge between the two diagnostic classes in terms of symptomatology, family history and genetics\" (Ref. 1, p 123). Bipolar disorders underwent a few changes in the \"DSM-5\", most notably the addition of more specific symptomology related to hypomanic and mixed manic states. Depressive disorders underwent the most changes, the addition of three new disorders: disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, persistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (previously in appendix B, the section for disorders needing further research). Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is meant as a diagnosis for children and adolescents who would normally be diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a way to limit the bipolar diagnosis in this age cohort. Major depressive disorder (MDD) also underwent a notable change, in that the bereavement clause has been removed. Those previously exempt from a diagnosis of MDD due to bereavement are now candidates for the MDD diagnosis.\nTreatment.\nThere are different types of treatments available for mood disorders, such as therapy and medications. Behaviour therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy and interpersonal therapy have all shown to be potentially beneficial in depression. Major depressive disorder medications usually include antidepressants; a combination of antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy has shown to be more effective than one treatment alone. Bipolar disorder medications can consist of antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants and/or lithium. Lithium specifically has been proven to reduce suicide and all causes of mortality in people with mood disorders. If mitochondrial dysfunction or mitochondrial diseases are the cause of mood disorders like bipolar disorder, then it has been hypothesized that N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR), S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), creatine monohydrate (CM), and melatonin could be potential treatment options. In determining treatment, there are many types of depression scales that are used. One of the depression scales is a self-report scale called Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Another scale is the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). HAMD is a clinical rating scale in which the patient is rated based on clinician observation. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a scale for depression symptoms that applies to the general population. This scale is typically used in research and not for self-reports. The PHQ-9 which stands for Patient-Health Questionnaire-9 questions, is a self-report as well. Finally, the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) evaluates bipolar disorder.\nEpidemiology.\nAccording to a substantial number of epidemiology studies conducted, women are twice as likely to develop certain mood disorders, such as major depression. Although there is an equal number of men and women diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, women have a slightly higher frequency of the disorder.\nIn 2011, mood disorders were the most common reason for hospitalization among children aged 1\u201317 years in the United States, with approximately 112,000 stays. Mood disorders were top principal diagnosis for Medicaid super-utilizers in the United States in 2012. Further, a study of 18 states found that mood disorders accounted for the highest number of hospital readmissions among Medicaid patients and the uninsured, with 41,600 Medicaid patients and 12,200 uninsured patients being readmitted within 30 days of their index stay\u2014a readmission rate of 19.8 per 100 admissions and 12.7 per 100 admissions, respectively. In 2012, mood and other behavioral health disorders were the most common diagnoses for Medicaid-covered and uninsured hospital stays in the United States (6.1% of Medicaid stays and 5.2% of uninsured stays).\nA study conducted in 1988 to 1994 amongst young American adults involved a selection of demographic and health characteristics. A population-based sample of 8,602 men and women ages 17\u201339 years participated. Lifetime prevalence were estimated based on six mood measures:\nResearch.\nKay Redfield Jamison and others have explored the possible links between mood disorders \u2013 especially bipolar disorder \u2013 and creativity. It has been proposed that a \"ruminating personality type may contribute to both [mood disorders] and art.\"\nJane Collingwood notes an Oregon State University study that:looked at the occupational status of a large group of typical patients and found that 'those with bipolar illness appear to be disproportionately concentrated in the most creative occupational category.' They also found that the likelihood of 'engaging in creative activities on the job' is significantly higher for bipolar than nonbipolar workers.In Liz Paterek's article \"Bipolar Disorder and the Creative Mind\" she wrote:Memory and creativity are related to mania. Clinical studies have shown that those in a manic state will rhyme, find synonyms, and use alliteration more than controls. This mental fluidity could contribute to an increase in creativity. Moreover, mania creates increases in productivity and energy. Those in a manic state are more emotionally sensitive and show less inhibition about attitudes, which could create greater expression. Studies performed at Harvard looked into the amount of original thinking in solving creative tasks. Bipolar individuals, whose disorder was not severe, tended to show greater degrees of creativity.The relationship between depression and creativity appears to be especially strong among poets.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic). Unlike liberal democracy, a representative democracy may have \"de facto\" multiparty and free and fair elections, but may not have a fully developed rule of law and additional individual and minority rights beyond the electoral sphere.\nRepresentative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people. Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives). Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy.\nRepresentative democracy can be organized in different ways including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber (unicameral), two chambers (bicameral), or more than two chambers (multicameral). Where two or more chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways.\nPowers of representatives.\nRepresentatives are elected by the public, as in national elections for the national legislature. Elected representatives may hold the power to select other representatives, presidents, or other officers of the government or of the legislature, as the prime minister in the latter case.\nThe power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power:\nSome political theorists, such as Edmund Burke, believe that part of the duty of a representative is not simply to follow the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters. A representative who chooses to execute the wishes of their constituents acts as a delegate. If the representative chooses to use their best judgment and knowledge in making decisions, even when the constituents do not fully agree with the decision, then the representative acts as a trustee.\nHistory.\nThe Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems.\nIn Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nThe American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states.\nIn 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848.\nRepresentative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states where large numbers of citizens evinced interest in politics, but where technology and population figures remained unsuited to direct democracy. Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom.\nGlobally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches.\nResearch on representation \"per se\".\nSeparate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes to the detriment of the population at large.\nCriticisms.\nIn his book \"Political Parties\", written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy.\nRepresentative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book \"Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas\" which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947. Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: \nA drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance. Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized.\nProponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system.\nThe V-Dem Institute classifies electoral democracies as the bare minimum of democracies, describing them as being governments that are \"de-facto accountable to citizens through periodic elections\", but are not liberal democracies and lack further entrenched individual and minority rights beyond the electoral sphere. Basic representative democracies may not possess a fully developed rule of law, legislative and judicial oversight of the executive branch, protections against the \"tyranny of the majority\", and only minimal fulfillment of Robert Dahl's institutional prerequisites for democracy.\nProposed solutions.\nThe system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book \"La Stochocratie\". Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs.\nThe system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "52319", "revid": "48565998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52319", "title": "Livable Netherlands", "text": "Livable Netherlands (, LN) was a Dutch political party. Pim Fortuyn began his political career in the party.\nHistory.\nHistorically there have always been parties in States Provincial (provincial legislatures) and municipal councils that were independent from the national party system. In the predominantly Catholic south of the Netherlands during the 1950s, the Catholic People's Party gained eighty percent of the vote in national elections, local and provincial groups of independents were organised.\nDuring the 1980s, independent parties began to spread to other parts of the Netherlands. Some successful groups like Independent Rijswijk began to move towards a national movement. A congress for this purpose held in 1989 did not result in much progress towards this goal, although independent parties were still very successful in municipal elections especially in Hilversum and Utrecht.\nSome of them chose the name \"Leefbaar\" (\"liveable\"). It became a distinct political movement. It was not a party in itself but consisted of many municipal branches. These branches had no formal ties, and often had radically different programs, sharing only their disdain for the political establishment.\nIn 1999, prominent media personalities Henk Westbroek and Jan Nagel, chairs of the highly successful Leefbaar Utrecht and Leefbaar Hilversum parties respectively, founded Leefbaar Nederland as a spin-off from their local parties. Nagel became the party's chair. Nagel had previously been chair of the VARA, a broadcaster linked to the Labour Party.\nIn 2001, the party's support and visibility began to increase. They came to be seen as an opposition movement against the second Kok cabinet. Nagel approached Pim Fortuyn to join the party. Fortuyn was a former sociology professor and business consultant who had risen to public prominence as a media figure, newspaper columnist and author who had announced his desire to stand for parliament in a 2001 interview, albeit without specifying which party he would seek his candidacy with. Although Fortuyn had considered running for the Christian Democratic Appeal, he decided to join Leefbaar Nederland. In November 2001 Fortuyn was elected as the party's lead candidate and LN saw rapid growth in opinion polls. On 10 February, a few months before the election, he was discharged as leader because of a controversial interview published in the \"Volkskrant\" newspaper concerning immigration and Islam. The LN board asked Fortuyn to retract his statements but Fortuyn refused. Fortuyn subsequently organised his own party, the Pim Fortuyn List, taking several former LN parliamentary candidates and members with him. On 10 March the Amsterdam public prosecutor Fred Teeven was chosen as new lead candidate. In the election of May 2002, the party won only two seats in the House of Representatives while the Pim Fortuyn List polled in second place with 26 seats.\nIn the election of 2003, self-help guru Emile Ratelband was put forward by the party board as their candidate for the lead candidate position. Teeven, who had gained some recognition as MP, withdrew his candidacy for the position when a motion of no confidence was not supported by the party's congress. During a tumultuous congress, the 22-year-old Haitske van der Linde, the daughter of TV personality Wibo van der Linde and candidate of the party's youth movement J@L, was elected lead candidate. She was unable to hold on to the two seats the party held, and the party left parliament. Ratelband, who had formed his own list, was still less successful in the polls. The party tried to dissolve itself, but there were not enough members present at the congress to do that, and the party left the public spotlight. In 2006, the party announced that it would disband itself: it owed a large debt to the Ministry of the Interior, who had lent them money for the 2003 election, and only a handful of paying members were left.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName.\nThe term \"Leefbaar\" was turned into a political brand by the Leefbaar Utrecht and Hilversum parties; the founders tried to reproduce this success by taking over the name.\nIdeology and issues.\nThe party was a populist party, oriented towards democratising society and solving several difficult political issues pragmatically. The party saw itself as a movement against the 'old parties' and especially those cooperating in the second Kok cabinet and sought not to characterize itself on the traditional left-right political spectrum. The core principles of the party included direct democracy, reliable government, downsizing state bureaucracy and law &amp; order policies.\nThey had a ten-point plan which included:\nRepresentation.\nHouse of Representatives.\nThe party were unable to ever obtain any European Parliament or Senate seats. Their support came mostly from independent voters, who no longer felt connected to a particular party.\nMunicipal and Provincial Government.\nThe municipal and local Leefbaar parties were not an official part of the party. Some of these parties, most notably Livable Rotterdam were however founded around the same time hoping to gain from the same momentum. Many of these parties are represented in provincial and municipal councils and cooperated in several municipal executives. They were highly successful in the 2002 municipal elections, but lost much of their support in the 2006 municipal elections.\nOrganisation.\nOrganisational structure.\nThe highest organ of LN was the Congress in which every member could participate. It convened once every year. It appointed the party board and decided the order of the House of Representatives, Senate and European Parliament candidate lists and had the final say over the party program.\nLinked organisations.\nThe party's youth organisation was called Jong@Leefbaar.nl (Young@Livable.nl; J@L). The party published \"De Leefbaar Koerier\" (Livable Courier). The scientific institute of the party was called Foundation Scientific Bureau Livable Netherlands, which published \"De Fundering\" (The Foundation).\nInternational comparison.\nInternationally, Leefbaar Nederland may be compared to Forza Italia, a populist party centered on a prominent media personality."}

{"id": "52321", "revid": "211905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52321", "title": "Freedom House", "text": "American nonprofit organization\nFreedom House is a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. It is best known for political advocacy surrounding issues of democracy, political freedom, and human rights. Freedom House was founded in October 1941, with Wendell Willkie and Eleanor Roosevelt serving as its first honorary chairpersons. Most of the organization's funding comes from the U.S. State Department and other government grants. It also receives funds from various semi-public and private foundations, as well as individual contributions.\nThe organization's annual \"Freedom in the World\" report assesses each country's degree of political freedoms and civil liberties. Another key annual report, \"Freedom on the Net\", is Freedom House's annual survey and analysis of internet freedom around the world. While often cited by political scientists, journalists, and policymakers, the organization's democracy indices have received criticism.\nBetween the 1970s and 2000s, critics predominately alleged that the organization was biased towards American interests due to government funding; others criticized the organization's reliance on democratic indices created near-exclusively by Raymond Gastil. In 2018, the rankings were criticized by \"National Review\", a conservative magazine, for its perceptions of the NGO being \"anti-conservative\".\nHistory.\nFreedom House was incorporated October 31, 1941. Among its founders were Eleanor Roosevelt, Wendell Willkie, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, Elizabeth Cutter Morrow, Dorothy Thompson, George Field, Herbert Agar, Herbert Bayard Swope, Ralph Bunche, Father George B. Ford, Roscoe Drummond and Rex Stout. Thompson and Dr. Frank Kingdon were co-chairs. George Field (1904\u20132006) was executive director of the organization until his retirement in 1967.\nAccording to its website, Freedom House was founded in 1941. Several groups were aggressively supporting U.S. entry into World War II and in early autumn 1941, when various group activities began to overlap, the Fight for Freedom Committee began exploring a mass merger. George Field then conceived the idea of all of the groups maintaining their separate identities under one roof\u2014Freedom House\u2014to promote the concrete application of the principles of freedom.\nFreedom House had physical form in a New York City building that represented the organization's goals. A converted residence at 32 East 51st Street opened January 22, 1942, as a centre \"where all who love liberty may meet, plan their programs and encourage one another\". Furnished as a gift of the Allies, the 19-room building included a broadcasting facility. In January 1944, Freedom House moved to 5 West 54th Street, a former residence that Robert Lehman lent to the organization.\nFreedom House sponsored influential radio programs including \"The Voice of Freedom\" (1942\u201343) and \"Our Secret Weapon\" (1942\u201343), a CBS radio series created to counter Axis shortwave radio propaganda broadcasts. Rex Stout, chairman of the Writers' War Board and representative of Freedom House, would rebut the most entertaining lies of the week. The series was produced by Paul White, founder of CBS News.\nBy November 1944, Freedom House was planning to raise money to acquire a building to be named after the recently deceased Wendell L. Willkie. In 1945 an elegant building at 20 West 40th Street was purchased to house the organization. It was named the Willkie Memorial Building.\nAfter the war, as its website states, \"Freedom House took up the struggle against the other twentieth century totalitarian threat, Communism ... The organization's leadership was convinced that the spread of democracy would be the best weapon against totalitarian ideologies.\" Freedom House supported the Marshall Plan and the establishment of NATO. Freedom House also supported the Johnson Administration's Vietnam War policies.\nFreedom House was highly critical of McCarthyism. During the 1950s and 1960s, it supported the Civil Rights Movement in the United States and its leadership included several prominent civil rights activists\u00a0\u2013 though it was sometimes critical of civil rights leaders for their anti-war activism, Freedom House awarded Martin Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers its annual Freedom Award in 1963. It supported Andrei Sakharov, other Soviet dissidents, and the Solidarity movement in Poland. Freedom House assisted the post-Communist societies in the establishment of independent media, non-governmental think tanks, and the core institutions of electoral politics.\nThe organization describes itself currently as a clear voice for democracy and freedom around the world. Freedom House states that it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;has vigorously opposed dictatorships in Central America and Chile, apartheid in South Africa, the suppression of the Prague Spring, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda, and the brutal violation of human rights in Cuba, Burma, the People's Republic of China, and Iraq. It has championed the rights of democratic activists, religious believers, trade unionists, journalists, and proponents of free markets.\nIn 1967, Freedom House absorbed Books USA, which had been created several years earlier by Edward R. Murrow, as a joint venture between the Peace Corps and the United States Information Service.\nSince 2001, Freedom House has supported citizens involved in challenges to the existing regimes in Serbia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere. The organization states, \"From South Africa to Jordan, Kyrgyzstan to Indonesia, Freedom House has partnered with regional activists in bolstering civil society; worked to support women's rights; sought justice for victims of torture; defended journalists and free expression advocates; and assisted those struggling to promote human rights in challenging political environments.\" However, alternative classifications have produced significantly different results from those of the FH for Latin American countries.\nOrganization.\nFreedom House is a nonprofit organization with approximately 300 staff members worldwide. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., it has field offices in about a dozen countries, including Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Jordan, Mexico, and also countries in Central Asia.\nFreedom House states that its board of trustees is composed of \"business and labor leaders, former senior government officials, scholars, writers, and journalists\". All board members are current residents of the United States. Past members of the organization's board of directors include Kenneth Adelman, Farooq Kathwari, Azar Nafisi, Mark Palmer, P. J. O'Rourke and Lawrence Lessig, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Samuel Huntington, Mara Liasson, Otto Reich, Donald Rumsfeld, Whitney North Seymour, Paul Wolfowitz, Steve Forbes and Bayard Rustin.\nFunding.\nAccording to their 2022 financial statement and independent auditors' report, Freedom House reported $93,705,255 of total revenue:\nFreedom House's total expenses in 2022 were $85,530,680.https://\nReports.\n\"Freedom in the World\".\nSince 1973, Freedom House publishes an annual report, \"Freedom in the World\", which it seeks to assess the current state of civil liberties and political rights in 195 countries and 15 territories.\nFreedom House's methods (around 1990) and other democracy-researchers were mentioned as examples of an expert-based evaluation by sociologist Kenneth A. Bollen, who is also an applied statistician. Bollen writes that expert-based evaluations are prone to statistical bias of an unknown direction, that is, not known either to agree with U.S. policy or to disagree with U.S. policy: \"Regardless of the direction of distortions, it is highly likely that every set of indicators formed by a single author or organization contains systematic measurement error. The origin of this measure lies in the common methodology of forming measures. Selectivity of information and various traits of the judges fuse into a distinct form of bias that is likely to characterize all indicators from a common publication.\"\n\"Freedom of the Press\".\nThe \"Freedom of the Press\" index was an annual survey of media independence, published between 1980 and 2017. It assessed the degree of print, broadcast, and internet freedom throughout the world, classifying nation-states as \"free\", \"partly-free\", and \"not-free\" as a result.\nAn independent review of press freedom studies, commissioned by the Knight Foundation in 2006, found that FOP was the best in its class of Press Freedom Indicators.\n\"Freedom on the Net\".\nThe \"Freedom on the Net\" reports provide analytical reports and numerical ratings regarding the state of Internet freedom for countries worldwide.\nFreedom on the Net's report covers a range of concepts that the other datasets do not, such as new legislation passed, but lacks the country coverage of other datasets.\nExpert surveys on the internet by the likes of Freedom House and V-Dem have been found to be more prone to false positives, while the remote sensing research by Access Now and the OpenNet Initiative are more likely to be prone to false negatives.\nThe Millennium Challenge Corporation used the Key Internet Controls portion of the Freedom on the Net report to inform its country selection process until 2020 when this report was replaced with data on internet shutdowns from Access Now.\nCriticism.\nRelationship with the U.S. government.\nIn 2006, the \"Financial Times\" reported that Freedom House had received funding by the State Department for \"clandestine activities\" inside Iran. According to the \"Financial Times\", \"Some academics, activists and those involved in the growing US business of spreading freedom and democracy are alarmed that such semi-covert activities risk damaging the public and transparent work of other organisations, and will backfire inside Iran.\"\nOn December 7, 2004, former U.S. House Representative and Libertarian politician Ron Paul criticized Freedom House for allegedly administering a U.S.-funded program in Ukraine where \"much of that money was targeted to assist one particular candidate.\" Paul said \"one part that we do know thus far is that the U.S. government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), granted millions of dollars to the Poland-America-Ukraine Cooperation Initiative (PAUCI), which is administered by the U.S.-based Freedom House. PAUCI then sent U.S. Government funds to numerous Ukrainian non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This would be bad enough and would in itself constitute meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation. But, what is worse is that many of these grantee organizations in Ukraine are blatantly in favor of presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko.\"\nNoam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman have criticized the organization for excessively criticizing states opposed to US interests while being unduly sympathetic to regimes supportive of US interests. Most notably, Freedom House described the 1979 Rhodesian general election as \"fair\", but described the 1980 Southern Rhodesian general election as \"dubious\", and found the 1982 Salvadoran presidential election to be \"admirable\".\nAcademic commentary.\nAccording to one study, Freedom House's rankings \"overemphasize the more formal aspects of democracy while failing to capture the informal but real power relations and pathways of influence ... and frequently lead to de facto deviations from democracy.\" States can therefore \"look formally liberal-democratic but might be rather illiberal in their actual workings\"\nAcademic Wenfang Tang observes that Freedom House reports use criteria developed by Western elites.77\nA study comparing Freedom House rankings with the World Values Survey data measuring respondent's perceptions of freedom in their countries found no statistically significant correlation between the Freedom House measures of freedom and subjective feelings of freedom. According to Tang, Freedom House rankings exaggerate the differences between liberal and non-liberal countries, observing for example that Freedom House scores China near zero, but Chinese survey respondents report a higher level of freedom than do survey respondents in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. Tang also observes that Freedom House's rating of China as a near zero for human rights conflicts with the seventh wave (2017-2022) World Values survey data indicating that 72% of Chinese are satisfied with the state of human rights in their country.\nCuban, Sudanese, and Chinese criticism.\nIn May 2001, the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations of the United Nations heard arguments for and against Freedom House. Representatives of Cuba said that the organization is a U.S. foreign policy instrument linked to the CIA and \"submitted proof of the politically motivated, interventionist activities the NGO (Freedom House) carried out against their Government\". They also claimed a lack of criticism of U.S. human rights violations in the annual reports. Cuba also stated that these violations are well documented by other reports, such as those of Human Rights Watch. Other countries such as China and Sudan also gave criticism. The Russian representative inquired \"why this organization, an NGO which defended human rights, was against the creation of the International Criminal Court?\"\nThe U.S. representative stated that alleged links between Freedom House and the CIA were \"simply not true\". The representative said he agreed that the NGO receives funds from the United States Government, but said this is disclosed in its reports. The representative said the funds were from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was not a branch of the CIA. The representative said his country had a law prohibiting the government from engaging in the activities of organizations seeking to change public policy, such as Freedom House. The representative said his country was not immune from criticism from Freedom House, which he said was well documented. The U.S. representative further argued that Freedom House was a human rights organization which sought to represent those who did not have a voice. The representative said he would continue to support NGOs who criticized his government and those of others.\nIn December 2019, Freedom House, together with four other U.S.-based democracy and human rights organizations, was sanctioned by the Chinese government. In August 2020, then Freedom House president Michael Abramowitz, together with the heads of the same four groups and six U.S. Republican lawmakers, were also sanctioned, with the Chinese foreign ministry saying these individuals had \"blatantly intervened in Hong Kong affairs, grossly interfered in China's internal affairs, and seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations\". The leaders of the five organizations saw the sanctioning, whose details were unspecified, as a tit-for-tat measure in response to the earlier sanctioning by the U.S. of 11 Hong Kong officials. The latter step had in turn been a reaction to the enactment of the Hong Kong National Security Law at the end of June.\nRussia.\nRussia, identified by Freedom House as \"Not Free\", called Freedom House biased and accused the group of serving U.S. interests. Sergei Markov, an MP from the ruling United Russia party, called Freedom House a \"Russophobic\" organization, commenting: \"You can listen to everything they say, except when it comes to Russia ... There are many Russophobes there.\" Christopher Walker, director of studies at Freedom House, posited that Freedom House made its evaluations based on objective criteria explained on the organization's website, and denied that it had a pro-U.S. agenda, saying: \"If you look closely at the 193 countries that we evaluate, you'll find that we criticize what are often considered strategic allies of the United States.\"\nUCLA political scientist Daniel Treisman has criticized Freedom House's assessment of Russia. Treisman cited that Freedom House ranks Russia's political rights on the same level as the United Arab Emirates, which is a federation of absolute monarchies with no element of democracy within the system. Freedom House also ranks Russia's civil liberties on the same scale as those of Yemen, where criticism of the president was illegal. Treisman contrasts Freedom House's ranking with the Polity IV scale used by academics, in which Russia has a much better score. In 2018, the Polity IV scale scored the United Arab Emirates at -8, Russia at +4, and the United States at +8.\nIn May 2024, Russian authorities declared Freedom House an \"undesirable organization\".\nAlleged partiality toward Uzbekistan.\nCraig Murray, the British ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2002 to 2004, wrote that the executive director of Freedom House told him in 2003 that the group decided to back off from its efforts to spotlight human rights abuses in Uzbekistan, because some Republican board members (in Murray's words) \"expressed concern that Freedom House was failing to keep in sight the need to promote freedom in the widest sense, by giving full support to U.S. and coalition forces\". Human rights abuses in Uzbekistan at the time included the killing of prisoners by \"immersion in boiling liquid\", and by strapping on a gas mask and blocking the filters, Murray reported. Jennifer Windsor, the executive director of Freedom House in 2003, replied that Murray's \"characterization of our conversation is an inexplicable misrepresentation not only of what was said at that meeting, but of Freedom House's record in Uzbekistan ... Freedom House has been a consistent and harsh critic of the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, as clearly demonstrated in press releases and in our annual assessments of that country\".\nCriticism from American conservatives.\nIn the 2010s, a number of American conservative institutions have accused Freedom House of anti-conservative shift in the organization; the organization has been criticized as being biased against conservative governments and the policies they enact, and has also been accused of favoring progressive and left-wing ideas in its ranking system. It has also been criticized for a perceived shift to an activist mindset; a 2018 article in the \"National Review\" described it as having \"changed dramatically since its anti-Communist days during the Cold War\" and having \"become simply another progressive, anti-conservative (and overwhelmingly government-dependent) NGO\". Another article criticized Freedom House for characterizing differences in policy as anti-democratic and for using what it regarded as partisan rather than objective measures of democracy.\nCriticism from Vietnam.\nAs Vietnam is a one-party socialist state, it is a frequent target for criticism and accusations from Freedom House, resulting in strong responses and criticism made by Vietnamese media against the organization.\nThe section about Vietnam in Freedom on the Net publication is criticized by Vietnamese state media, as Freedom House accuses Vietnam to not have Internet freedom in this publication.\nChronology of systematic evaluations.\nFrom the 1970s until 1990, Raymond Gastil practically produced the reports on his own, though sometimes with help from his wife. Gastil himself described it in 1990 as \"a loose, intuitive rating system for levels of freedom or democracy, as defined by the traditional political rights and civil liberties of the Western democracies.\" Regarding criticisms of his reports, he said: \"generally such criticism is based on opinions about Freedom House rather than detailed examination of survey ratings\".\nIn a 1986 report on the methodology used by Gastil and others to create \"Freedom in the World\" report, Kenneth A. Bollen noted some bias but found that \"no criticisms of which I am aware have demonstrated a systematic bias in all the ratings. Most of the evidence consists of anecdotal evidence of relatively few cases. Whether there is a systematic or sporadic slant in Gastil's ratings is an open question\". In a later report by Bollen and Pamela Paxton in 2000, they concluded that from 1972 to 1988 (a specific period they observed), there was \"unambiguous evidence of judge-specific measurement errors, which are related to traits of the countries.\" They estimated that Gastil's method produced a bias of 0.38\u00a0standard\u00a0deviations (s.d.) against Communist countries and a larger bias, 0.5 s.d., favoring Christian countries.\nIn 2001, a study by Mainwaring, Brink, and Perez-Linanhe found the Freedom Index of \"Freedom in the World\" to have a strong positive correlation (at least 80%) with three other democracy indices. Mainwaring \"et al.\" wrote that Freedom House's index had \"two systematic biases: scores for leftist were tainted by political considerations, and changes in scores are sometimes driven by changes in their criteria rather than changes in real conditions\". Nonetheless, when evaluated on Latin American countries yearly, Freedom House's index was positively correlated with the index of Adam Przeworski and with the index of the authors themselves. However, according to Przeworski in 2003, the definition of freedom in Gastil (1982) and Freedom House (1990) emphasized liberties rather than the exercise of freedom. He gave the following example: In the United States, citizens are free to form political parties and to vote, yet even in presidential elections only half of U.S. citizens vote; in the U.S., \"the same two parties speak in a commercially sponsored unison\".\nA 2014 report by comparative politics researcher Nils D. Steiner found \"strong and consistent evidence of a substantial bias in the FH ratings\" before 1988, with bias being reflected by the relationships between the U.S. and the countries under investigation. He writes that after 1989 the findings were not as strong but still hinted at political bias. In 2017, Sarah Sunn Bush wrote that many critics found the original pre-1990 methodology lacking. While this improved after a team was hired in 1990, she says some criticism remains. As for why the Freedom House index is most often quoted in the United States, she notes that its definition of democracy is closely aligned with US foreign policy. US-allied countries tend to get better scores than in other reports. However, because the report is important to US lawmakers and politicians, weaker states seeking US aid or favor are forced to respond to the reports, giving the Freedom House significant influence in those places.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "52324", "revid": "43574019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52324", "title": "Non-departmental public body", "text": "UK public sector organisation\nIn the United Kingdom, non-departmental public body (NDPB) is a classification applied by the Cabinet Office, Treasury, the Scottish Government, and the Northern Ireland Executive to public sector organisations that have a role in the process of national government but are not part of a government department. NDPBs carry out their work largely independently from ministers and are accountable to the public through Parliament; however, ministers are responsible for the independence, effectiveness, and efficiency of non-departmental public bodies in their portfolio.\nThe term includes the four types of NDPB (executive, advisory, tribunal, and independent monitoring boards) but excludes public corporations and public broadcasters (BBC, Channel 4, and S4C).\nTypes of body.\nThe UK Government classifies bodies into four main types. The Scottish Government also has a fifth category: NHS bodies.\nAdvisory NDPBs.\nThese bodies consist of boards which advise ministers on particular policy areas. They are often supported by a small secretariat from the parent department, and any expenditure is paid for by that department.\nExecutive NDPBs.\nThese bodies usually deliver a particular public service and are overseen by a board rather than ministers. Appointments are made by ministers following the Code of Practice of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. They employ their own staff and allocate their own budgets.\nTribunal NDPBs.\nThese bodies have jurisdiction over an area of the law. They are coordinated by His Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice, and supervised by the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, itself an NDPB sponsored by the Ministry of Justice.\nIndependent monitoring boards.\nThese bodies were formerly known as \"boards of visitors\" and are responsible for the state of prisons, their administration, and the treatment of prisoners. The Home Office is responsible for their costs and has to note all expenses.\nContrast with executive agencies, non-ministerial departments and quangos.\nNDPB differ from executive agencies as they are not created to carry out ministerial orders or policy, instead they are more or less self-determining and enjoy greater independence. They are also not directly part of government like a non-ministerial government department being at a remove from both ministers and any elected assembly or parliament. Typically an NDPB would be established under statute and be accountable to Parliament rather than to His Majesty's Government. This arrangement allows more financial independence since the government is obliged to provide funding to meet statutory obligations.\nNDPBs are sometimes referred to as quangos. However, this term originally referred to quasi-NGOs bodies that are, at least ostensibly, non-government organisations, but nonetheless perform governmental functions. The backronym \"quasi-autonomous national government organization\" is used in this usage which is normally pejorative.\nHistory, numbers and powers.\nIn March 2009 there were nearly 800 public bodies that were sponsored by the UK Government. This total included 198 executive NDPBs, 410 advisory bodies, 33 tribunals, 21 public corporations, the Bank of England, 2 public broadcasting authorities and 23 NHS bodies. However, the classification is conservative and does not include bodies that are the responsibility of devolved government, various lower tier boards (including a considerable number within the NHS), and also other boards operating in the public sector (e.g. school governors and police authorities).\nThese appointed bodies performed a large variety of tasks, for example health trusts, or the Welsh Development Agency, and by 1992 were responsible for some 25% of all government expenditure in the UK. According to the Cabinet Office their total expenditure for the financial year 2005\u201306 was \u00a3167 billion. \nAs of March 2020, there were 237 non-departmental public bodies. \nCriticism.\nCritics argued that the system was open to abuse as most NDPBs had their members directly appointed by government ministers without an election or consultation with the people. The press, critical of what was perceived as the Conservatives' complacency in power in the 1990s, presented much material interpreted as evidence of questionable government practices.\nThis concern led to the formation of a Committee on Standards in Public Life (the Nolan Committee) which first reported in 1995 and recommended the creation of a \"public appointments commissioner\" to make sure that appropriate standards were met in the appointment of members of NDPBs. The Government accepted the recommendation, and the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments was established in November 1995.\nWhile in opposition, the Labour Party promised to reduce the number and power of NDPBs. The use of NDPBs continued under the Labour government in office from 1997 to 2010, though the political controversy associated with NDPBs in the mid-1990s for the most part died away.\nIn 2010 the UK's Conservative-Liberal coalition published a review of NDPBs recommending closure or merger of nearly two hundred bodies, and the transfer of others to the private sector. This process was colloquially termed the \"bonfire of the quangos\".\nClassification in national accounts.\nNDPBs are classified under code S.13112 of the European System of Accounts (ESA.95). However, Statistics UK does not break out the detail for these bodies and they are consolidated into General Government (S.1311).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

That is, it is a set of invertible elements with a single associative binary operation, and it contains an element\u00a0\"g\" such that every other element of the group may be obtained by repeatedly applying the group operation to\u00a0\"g\" or its inverse. Each element can be written as an integer power of\u00a0\"g\" in multiplicative notation, or as an integer multiple of \"g\" in additive notation. This element\u00a0\"g\" is called a \"generator\" of the group.\nEvery infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group of\u00a0Z, the integers. Every finite cyclic group of order\u00a0\"n\" is isomorphic to the additive group of Z/\"n\"Z, the integers modulo\u00a0\"n\". Every cyclic group is an abelian group (meaning that its group operation is commutative), and every finitely generated abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups.\nEvery cyclic group of prime order is a simple group, which cannot be broken down into smaller groups. In the classification of finite simple groups, one of the three infinite classes consists of the cyclic groups of prime order. The cyclic groups of prime order are thus among the building blocks from which all groups can be built.\nDefinition and notation.\nFor any element\u00a0\"g\" in any group\u00a0\"G\", one can form the subgroup that consists of all its integer powers: \u27e8\"g\"\u27e9 = {\"g\"\"k\" | \"k\" \u2208 Z}, called the cyclic subgroup generated by\u00a0\"g\". The order of\u00a0\"g\" is |\u27e8\"g\"\u27e9|, the number of elements in\u00a0\u27e8\"g\"\u27e9, conventionally abbreviated as |\"g\"|, as ord(\"g\"), or as o(\"g\"). That is, the order of an element is equal to the order of the cyclic subgroup that it generates.\nA \"cyclic group\" is a group which is equal to one of its cyclic subgroups: \"G\" = \u27e8\"g\"\u27e9 for some element\u00a0\"g\", called a \"generator\" of \"G\".\nFor a finite cyclic group\u00a0\"G\" of order\u00a0\"n\" we have \"G\" = {\"e\", \"g\", \"g\"2, ... , \"g\"\"n\"\u22121}, where \"e\" is the identity element and \"g\"\"i\" = \"g\"\"j\" whenever \"i\" \u2261 \"j\" (mod\u00a0\"n\"); in particular \"g\"\"n\" = \"g\"0 = \"e\", and \"g\"\u22121 = \"g\"\"n\"\u22121. An abstract group defined by this multiplication is often denoted C\"n\", and we say that \"G\" is isomorphic to the standard cyclic group\u00a0C\"n\". Such a group is also isomorphic to Z/\"n\"Z, the group of integers modulo \"n\" with the addition operation, which is the standard cyclic group in additive notation. Under the isomorphism \"\u03c7\" defined by \"\u03c7\"(\"g\"\"i\") = \"i\" the identity element\u00a0\"e\" corresponds to\u00a00, products correspond to sums, and powers correspond to multiples.\nFor example, the set of complex 6th roots of unity: formula_2 forms a group under multiplication. It is cyclic, since it is generated by the primitive root formula_3 that is, \"G\" = \u27e8\"z\"\u27e9 = { 1, \"z\", \"z\"2, \"z\"3, \"z\"4, \"z\"5 } with \"z\"6 = 1. Under a change of letters, this is isomorphic to (structurally the same as) the standard cyclic group of order 6, defined as C6 = \u27e8\"g\"\u27e9 = {\"e\", \"g\", \"g\"2, \"g\"3, \"g\"4, \"g\"5} with multiplication \"g\"\"j\" \u00b7 \"g\"\"k\" = \"g\"\"j\"+\"k\" (mod 6), so that \"g\"6 = \"g\"0 = \"e\". These groups are also isomorphic to Z/6Z = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with the operation of addition modulo 6, with \"z\"\"k\" and \"g\"\"k\" corresponding to\u00a0\"k\". For example, 1 + 2 \u2261 3 (mod 6) corresponds to \"z\"1 \u00b7 \"z\"2 = \"z\"3, and 2 + 5 \u2261 1 (mod 6) corresponds to \"z\"2 \u00b7 \"z\"5 = \"z\"7 = \"z\"1, and so on. Any element generates its own cyclic subgroup, such as \u27e8\"z\"2\u27e9 = {\"e\", \"z\"2, \"z\"4} of order 3, isomorphic to C3 and Z/3Z; and \u27e8\"z\"5\u27e9 = { \"e\", \"z\"5, \"z\"10 = \"z\"4, \"z\"15 = \"z\"3, \"z\"20 = \"z\"2, \"z\"25 = \"z\" } = \"G\", so that \"z\"5 has order 6 and is an alternative generator of\u00a0\"G\".\nInstead of the quotient notations Z/\"n\"Z, Z/(\"n\"), or Z/\"n\", some authors denote a finite cyclic group as Z\"n\", but this clashes with the notation of number theory, where Z\"p\" denotes a \"p\"-adic number ring, or localization at a prime ideal.\nOn the other hand, in an infinite cyclic group \"G\" = \u27e8\"g\"\u27e9, the powers \"g\"\"k\" give distinct elements for all integers \"k\", so that \"G\" = {... , \"g\"\u22122, \"g\"\u22121, \"e\", \"g\", \"g\"2, ...}, and \"G\" is isomorphic to the standard group C = C\u221e and to Z, the additive group of the integers. An example is the first frieze group. Here there are no finite cycles, and the name \"cyclic\" may be misleading.\nTo avoid this confusion, Bourbaki introduced the term monogenous group for a group with a single generator and restricted \"cyclic group\" to mean a finite monogenous group, avoiding the term \"infinite cyclic group\".\nExamples.\nInteger and modular addition.\nThe set of integers\u00a0Z, with the operation of addition, forms a group. It is an infinite cyclic group, because all integers can be written by repeatedly adding or subtracting the single number\u00a01. In this group, 1 and \u22121 are the only generators. Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to\u00a0Z.\nFor every positive integer\u00a0\"n\", the set of integers modulo\u00a0\"n\", again with the operation of addition, forms a finite cyclic group, denoted Z/\"n\"Z.\nA modular integer\u00a0\"i\" is a generator of this group if \"i\" is relatively prime to\u00a0\"n\", because these elements can generate all other elements of the group through integer addition.\nEvery finite cyclic group \"G\" is isomorphic to Z/\"n\"Z, where \"n\" = |\"G\"| is the order of the group.\nThe addition operations on integers and modular integers, used to define the cyclic groups, are the addition operations of commutative rings, also denoted Z and Z/\"nZ or Z/(\"n\"). If \"p\" is a prime, then Z/\"pZ is a finite field, and is usually denoted F\"p\" or GF(\"p\") for Galois field.\nModular multiplication.\nFor every positive integer\u00a0\"n\", the set of the integers modulo\u00a0\"n\" that are relatively prime to\u00a0\"n\" is written as (Z/\"n\"Z)\u00d7; it forms a group under the operation of multiplication. This group is not always cyclic, but is so whenever \"n\" is 1, 2, 4, a power of an odd prime, or twice a power of an odd prime (sequence in the OEIS).\nThis is the multiplicative group of units of the ring Z/\"nZ; there are \"\u03c6\"(\"n\") of them, where again \"\u03c6\" is the Euler totient function. For example, (Z/6Z)\u00d7 = {1, 5}, and since 6 is twice an odd prime this is a cyclic group. In contrast, (Z/8Z)\u00d7 = {1, 3, 5, 7} is a Klein 4-group and is not cyclic. When (Z/\"nZ)\u00d7 is cyclic, its generators are called primitive roots modulo \"n\".\nFor a prime number\u00a0\"p\", the group (Z/\"p\"Z)\u00d7 is always cyclic, consisting of the non-zero elements of the finite field of order\u00a0\"p\". More generally, every finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of any field is cyclic.\nRotational symmetries.\nThe set of rotational symmetries of a polygon forms a finite cyclic group. If there are \"n\" different ways of moving the polygon to itself by a rotation (including the null rotation) then this symmetry group is isomorphic to Z/\"n\"Z. In three or higher dimensions there exist other finite symmetry groups that are cyclic, but which are not all rotations around an axis, but instead rotoreflections.\nThe group of all rotations of a circle (the circle group, also denoted \"S\"1) is \"not\" cyclic, because there is no single rotation whose integer powers generate all rotations. In fact, the infinite cyclic group C\u221e is countable, while \"S\"1 is not. The group of rotations by rational angles \"is\" countable, but still not cyclic.\nGalois theory.\nAn \"n\"th root of unity is a complex number whose \"n\"th power is\u00a01, a root of the polynomial \"x\"\"n\" \u2212 1. The set of all \"n\"th roots of unity forms a cyclic group of order \"n\" under multiplication. The generators of this cyclic group are the \"n\"th primitive roots of unity; they are the roots of the \"n\"th cyclotomic polynomial.\nFor example, the polynomial \"z\"3 \u2212 1 factors as (\"z\" \u2212 1)(\"z\" \u2212 \"\u03c9\")(\"z\" \u2212 \"\u03c9\"2), where \"\u03c9\" = \"e\"2\"\u03c0i\"/3; the set {1, \"\u03c9\", \"\u03c9\"2} = {\"\u03c9\"0, \"\u03c9\"1, \"\u03c9\"2} forms a cyclic group under multiplication. The Galois group of the field extension of the rational numbers generated by the \"n\"th roots of unity forms a different group, isomorphic to the multiplicative group (Z/nZ)\u00d7 of order \"\u03c6\"(\"n\"), which is cyclic for some but not all\u00a0\"n\" (see above).\nA field extension is called a cyclic extension if its Galois group is cyclic. For fields of characteristic zero, such extensions are the subject of Kummer theory, and are intimately related to solvability by radicals. For an extension of finite fields of characteristic\u00a0\"p\", its Galois group is always finite and cyclic, generated by a power of the Frobenius mapping. Conversely, given a finite field\u00a0\"F\" and a finite cyclic group\u00a0\"G\", there is a finite field extension of\u00a0\"F\" whose Galois group is\u00a0\"G\".\nSubgroups.\nAll subgroups and quotient groups of cyclic groups are cyclic. Specifically, all subgroups of Z are of the form \u27e8\"m\"\u27e9 = \"mZ, with \"m\" a positive integer. All of these subgroups are distinct from each other, and apart from the trivial group {0} = 0Z, they all are isomorphic to\u00a0Z. The lattice of subgroups of Z is isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of natural numbers ordered by divisibility. Thus, since a prime number\u00a0\"p\" has no nontrivial divisors, \"pZ is a maximal proper subgroup, and the quotient group Z/\"p\"Z is simple; in fact, a cyclic group is simple if and only if its order is prime.\nAll quotient groups Z/\"nZ are finite, with the exception Z/0Z = Z/{0}. For every positive divisor\u00a0\"d\" of\u00a0\"n\", the quotient group Z/\"nZ has precisely one subgroup of order\u00a0\"d\", generated by the residue class of\u00a0\"n\"/\"d\". There are no other subgroups.\nAdditional properties.\nEvery cyclic group is abelian. That is, its group operation is commutative: \"gh\" = \"hg\" (for all \"g\" and \"h\" in \"G\"). This is clear for the groups of integer and modular addition since \"r\" + \"s\" \u2261 \"s\" + \"r\" (mod \"n\"), and it follows for all cyclic groups since they are all isomorphic to these standard groups. For a finite cyclic group of order \"n\", \"g\"\"n\" is the identity element for any element\u00a0\"g\". This again follows by using the isomorphism to modular addition, since \"kn\" \u2261 0 (mod \"n\") for every integer\u00a0\"k\". (This is also true for a general group of order \"n\", due to Lagrange's theorem.)\nFor a prime power formula_4, the group formula_5 is called a primary cyclic group. The fundamental theorem of abelian groups states that every finitely generated abelian group is a finite direct product of primary cyclic and infinite cyclic groups.\nBecause a cyclic group is abelian, each of its conjugacy classes consists of a single element. A cyclic group of order\u00a0\"n\" therefore has \"n\" conjugacy classes.\nIf \"d\" is a divisor of\u00a0\"n\", then the number of elements in Z/\"n\"Z which have order \"d\" is \"\u03c6\"(\"d\"), and the number of elements whose order divides \"d\" is exactly\u00a0\"d\".\nIf \"G\" is a finite group in which, for each \"n\" &gt; 0, \"G\" contains at most \"n\" elements of order dividing \"n\", then \"G\" must be cyclic.\nThe order of an element \"m\" in Z/\"n\"Z is \"n\"/gcd(\"n\",\"m\").\nIf \"n\" and \"m\" are coprime, then the direct product of two cyclic groups Z/\"nZ and Z/\"mZ is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z/\"nm\"Z, and the converse also holds: this is one form of the Chinese remainder theorem. For example, Z/12Z is isomorphic to the direct product Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/4Z under the isomorphism (\"k\" mod 12) \u2192 (\"k\" mod 3, \"k\" mod 4); but it is not isomorphic to Z/6Z \u00d7 Z/2Z, in which every element has order at most\u00a06.\nIf \"p\" is a prime number, then any group with \"p\" elements is isomorphic to the simple group Z/\"p\"Z.\nA number \"n\" is called a cyclic number if Z/\"n\"Z is the only group of order\u00a0\"n\", which is true exactly when gcd(\"n\", \"\u03c6\"(\"n\")) = 1. The sequence of cyclic numbers include all primes, but some are composite such as\u00a015. However, all cyclic numbers are odd except\u00a02. The cyclic numbers are:\n1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 41, 43, 47, 51, 53, 59, 61, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 95, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 115, 119, 123, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 141, 143, ... (sequence in the OEIS)\nThe definition immediately implies that cyclic groups have group presentation C\u221e = \u27e8\"x\" | \u27e9 and C\"n\" = \u27e8\"x\" | \"x\"\"n\"\u27e9 for finite\u00a0\"n\".\nAssociated objects.\nRepresentations.\nThe representation theory of the cyclic group is a critical base case for the representation theory of more general finite groups. In the complex case, a representation of a cyclic group decomposes into a direct sum of linear characters, making the connection between character theory and representation theory transparent. In the positive characteristic case, the indecomposable representations of the cyclic group form a model and inductive basis for the representation theory of groups with cyclic Sylow subgroups and more generally the representation theory of blocks of cyclic defect.\nCycle graph.\nA cycle graph illustrates the various cycles of a group and is particularly useful in visualizing the structure of small finite groups. A cycle graph for a cyclic group is simply a circular graph, where the group order is equal to the number of nodes. A single generator defines the group as a directional path on the graph, and the inverse generator defines a backwards path. A trivial path (identity) can be drawn as a loop but is usually suppressed. Z2 is sometimes drawn with two curved edges as a multigraph.\nA cyclic group Z\"n\", with order \"n\", corresponds to a single cycle graphed simply as an \"n\"-sided polygon with the elements at the vertices.\nCayley graph.\nA Cayley graph is a graph defined from a pair (\"G\",\"S\") where \"G\" is a group and \"S\" is a set of generators for the group; it has a vertex for each group element, and an edge for each product of an element with a generator. In the case of a finite cyclic group, with its single generator, the Cayley graph is a cycle graph, and for an infinite cyclic group with its generator the Cayley graph is a doubly infinite path graph. However, Cayley graphs can be defined from other sets of generators as well. The Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with arbitrary generator sets are called circulant graphs. These graphs may be represented geometrically as a set of equally spaced points on a circle or on a line, with each point connected to neighbors with the same set of distances as each other point. They are exactly the vertex-transitive graphs whose symmetry group includes a transitive cyclic group.\nEndomorphisms.\nThe endomorphism ring of the abelian group Z/\"nZ is isomorphic to Z/\"nZ itself as a ring. Under this isomorphism, the number \"r\" corresponds to the endomorphism of Z/\"nZ that maps each element to the sum of \"r\" copies of it. This is a bijection if and only if \"r\" is coprime with \"n\", so the automorphism group of Z/\"nZ is isomorphic to the unit group (Z/\"n\"Z)\u00d7.\nSimilarly, the endomorphism ring of the additive group of\u00a0Z is isomorphic to the ring\u00a0Z. Its automorphism group is isomorphic to the group of units of the ring\u00a0Z, which is ({\u22121, +1}, \u00d7) \u2245 C2.\nTensor product and Hom of cyclic groups.\nThe tensor product Z/\"mZ \u2297 Z/\"nZ can be shown to be isomorphic to Z / gcd(\"m\", \"n\")Z. So we can form the collection of group homomorphisms from Z/\"mZ to Z/\"nZ, denoted hom(Z/\"mZ, Z/\"nZ), which is itself a group.\nFor the tensor product, this is a consequence of the general fact that \"R\"/\"I\" \u2297\"R\" \"R\"/\"J\" \u2245 \"R\"/(\"I\" + \"J\"), where \"R\" is a commutative ring with unit and \"I\" and \"J\" are ideals of the ring. For the Hom group, recall that it is isomorphic to the subgroup of Z / \"n\"Z consisting of the elements of order dividing \"m\". That subgroup is cyclic of order gcd(\"m\", \"n\"), which completes the proof.\nRelated classes of groups.\nSeveral other classes of groups have been defined by their relation to the cyclic groups:\nVirtually cyclic groups.\nA group is called virtually cyclic if it contains a cyclic subgroup of finite index (the number of cosets that the subgroup has). In other words, any element in a virtually cyclic group can be arrived at by multiplying a member of the cyclic subgroup and a member of a certain finite set. Every cyclic group is virtually cyclic, as is every finite group. An infinite group is virtually cyclic if and only if it is finitely generated and has exactly two ends; an example of such a group is the direct product of Z/\"n\"Z and Z, in which the factor Z has finite index\u00a0\"n\". Every abelian subgroup of a Gromov hyperbolic group is virtually cyclic.\nProcyclic groups.\nA profinite group is called procyclic if it can be topologically generated by a single element. Examples of profinite groups include the profinite integers formula_6 or the \"p\"-adic integers formula_7 for a prime number \"p\".\nLocally cyclic groups.\nA locally cyclic group is a group in which each finitely generated subgroup is cyclic. An example is the additive group of the rational numbers: every finite set of rational numbers is a set of integer multiples of a single unit fraction, the inverse of their lowest common denominator, and generates as a subgroup a cyclic group of integer multiples of this unit fraction. A group is locally cyclic if and only if its lattice of subgroups is a distributive lattice.\nCyclically ordered groups.\nA cyclically ordered group is a group together with a cyclic order preserved by the group structure. Every cyclic group can be given a structure as a cyclically ordered group, consistent with the ordering of the integers (or the integers modulo the order of the group).\nEvery finite subgroup of a cyclically ordered group is cyclic.\nMetacyclic and polycyclic groups.\nA metacyclic group is a group containing a cyclic normal subgroup whose quotient is also cyclic. These groups include the cyclic groups, the dicyclic groups, and the direct products of two cyclic groups. The polycyclic groups generalize metacyclic groups by allowing more than one level of group extension. A group is polycyclic if it has a finite descending sequence of subgroups, each of which is normal in the previous subgroup with a cyclic quotient, ending in the trivial group. Every finitely generated abelian group or nilpotent group is polycyclic.\nFootnotes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
