They spoke the Hurrian language, and lived throughout northern Syria, upper Mesopotamia and southeastern Anatolia.\nThe Hurrians were first documented in the city of Urkesh, where they built their first kingdom. The largest and most influential Hurrian kingdom was Mitanni. The population of the Hittite Empire in Anatolia included a large population of Hurrians, and there is significant Hurrian influence in Hittite mythology. By the Early Iron Age, the Hurrians had been assimilated with other peoples. The state of Urartu later covered some of the same area. A related people to the Hurrians are the Urarteans.\nHistory.\nEarly Bronze Age.\nThe Khabur River valley became the heart of the Hurrian lands for a millennium. The first known Hurrian kingdom emerged around the city of Urkesh (modern Tell Mozan) during the third millennium BC. There is evidence that they were initially allied with the Akkadian Empire of Mesopotamia, indicating they had a firm hold on the area by the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2254\u20132218 BC). A king of Urkesh with the Hurrian name Tupkish had a queen with the name Uqnitum, Akkadian for \"girl of lapis lazuli\".\nMiddle Bronze Age.\nHurrian names occur sporadically in northwestern Mesopotamia and the area of Kirkuk in modern Iraq by the Middle Bronze Age. Their presence was attested at Nuzi, Urkesh and other sites. They eventually occupied a broad arc of fertile farmland stretching from the Khabur River valley in the west to the foothills of the Zagros Mountains in the east. By this point, during the Old Babylonian period in the early second millennium BC, the Amorite kingdom of Mari to the south had subdued Urkesh and made it a vassal state. Urkesh later became a Mitanni religious center.\nThe Hurrians also migrated further west in this period. By 1725 BC, they are found also in parts of northern Syria, such as Alalakh. The mixed Amorite\u2013Hurrian kingdom of Yamhad is recorded as struggling for this area with the early Hittite king Hattusilis I around 1600 BC. Hurrians also settled in the coastal region of Adaniya in the country of Kizzuwatna, southern Anatolia. Yamhad eventually weakened vis-a-vis the powerful Hittites, but this also opened Anatolia for Hurrian cultural influences. The Hittites were influenced by both the Hurrian cultures over the course of several centuries.\nThe city of Shibaniba (Tell Billa) may have also played an important role at that time. Possible Hurrian occupation was identified at Tell Billa during the middle of the second millennium BC. In 2022, Tell Billa was proposed as the possible site of the city of \u0160im\u0101num (possibly known as Asim\u0101num during the Akkadian Empire). \u0160im\u0101num was important during the Ur III period (ca 2100 BC).\nLate Bronze Age.\nThe Mitanni Empire was a strong regional power limited by the Hittites to the north, Egyptians to the southwest, Kassites to the southeast and, later, by the Assyrians to the east. At its maximum extent, Mitanni ranged as far as west as Kizzuwatna by the Taurus mountains, Tunip in the south, Arraphe in the east, and north to Lake Van. Their sphere of influence is shown in the spread of Hurrian place names and personal names. Eventually, after an internal succession crisis, Mitanni fell to the Hittites, later to fall under the control of the Assyrians.\nThe Hurrian entity of Mitanni, which first rose to power before 1550 BC, was first mentioned in the records of Egyptian pharaohs Thutmose I (1506\u20131493 BC) and Thutmose III (1479\u20131425 BC), the later most notably associated with the Battle of Megiddo in that pharaoh's 22nd regnal year. Most of the time, Egyptians referred to the kingdom as Naharin. Later, Mitanni and Hanigalbat (the Assyrian name for Mitanni) are mentioned in the Amarna Letters during the time of Pharaoh Akhenaten (1353\u20131336 BC). Domestically, Mitanni records have been found at a number of places in the region, including several Hittite sites as well as Tell Bazi, Alalakh, Nuzi, Mardaman, Kemune, and M\u00fcsl\u00fcmantepe among others.\nAnother major center of Hurrian influence was the kingdom of Arrapha. Excavations at Yorgan Tepe, ancient Nuzi, proved this to be one of the most important sites for our knowledge about the Hurrians. Hurrian kings such as Ithi-Teshup and Ithiya ruled over Arrapha, yet by the mid-fifteenth century BC they had become vassals of the Great King of Mitanni.\nUrartu.\nAt the end of the second millennium BC, the Urartians around Lake Van and Mount Ararat rose in power forming the Kingdom of Urartu. During the 11th and 10th centuries BC, the kingdom eventually encompassed a region stretching from the Caucasus Mountains in the north, to the borders of northern Assyria and northern Ancient Iran in the south, and controlled much of eastern Anatolia. Some scientists consider Urartu to be a re-consolidation of earlier Hurrian populations mainly due to linguistic factors, but this view is not universally held.\nShubaru/Shubria.\nAfter the destruction of Mitanni by the Hittites around 1350-1325 BC, the term \"Shubaru\" was used in Assyrian sources to refer to the remnants of the Mitanni in the upper Tigris valley. The Shubaru people revolted against the Assyrians multiple times in the last centuries of the second millennium BC. The term is related to \"Shubria\", the name of a country located north of the upper Tigris River valley. Shubria was located between Urartu and Assyria and existed as an independent kingdom until its conquest by Assyria in 673\u2013672 BC. The Shubrians worshipped the Hurrian deity Teshub, and several Shubrian names have Hurrian origins. Hurrians formed part of the Shubrian population and may have been the predominant group. Some scholars have suggested that Shubria was the last remnant of Hurrian civilization, or even constituted the original homeland of the Hurrians. Karen Radner writes that Shubria \"can certainly be described as [a] (linguistically and culturally) Hurrian\" state. According to Radner, a letter from the king of Shubria to an Assyrian magnate from the time of Sargon II was composed in the Hurrian language.\nCulture and society.\nKnowledge of Hurrian culture relies on archaeological excavations at sites such as Nuzi and Alalakh as well as on cuneiform tablets, primarily from Hattusa (Boghazk\u00f6y), the capital of the Hittites, whose civilization was greatly influenced by the Hurrians. Tablets from Nuzi, Alalakh, and other cities with Hurrian populations (as shown by personal names) reveal Hurrian cultural features even though they were written in Akkadian. Hurrian cylinder seals were carefully carved and often portrayed mythological motifs. They are a key to the understanding of Hurrian culture and history.\nThe 2nd millennium Hurrians were masterful ceramists. Their pottery is commonly found in Mesopotamia and in the lands west of the Euphrates; it was highly valued in distant Egypt, by the time of the New Kingdom. Archaeologists use the terms Khabur ware and Nuzi ware for two types of wheel-made pottery used by the Hurrians. Khabur ware is characterized by reddish painted lines with a geometric triangular pattern and dots, while Nuzi ware has very distinctive forms, and are painted in brown or black. They were also skilled at glass working.\nThe Hurrians had a reputation in metallurgy. It is proposed that the Sumerian term for \"coppersmith\" \"tabira\"/\"tibira\" was borrowed from Hurrian, which would imply an early presence of the Hurrians way before their first historical mention in Akkadian sources. Copper was traded south to Mesopotamia from the highlands of Anatolia. The Khabur Valley had a central position in the metal trade, and copper, silver and even tin were accessible from the Hurrian-dominated countries Kizzuwatna and Ishuwa situated in the Anatolian highland. Gold was in short supply, and the Amarna letters inform us that it was acquired from Egypt. Not many examples of Hurrian metal work have survived, except from the later Urartu. Some small fine bronze lion foundation pegs were discovered at Urkesh.\nAmong the Hurrian texts from Ugarit are the oldest known instances of written music, dating from c. 1400 BC. Among these fragments are found the names of four Hurrian composers, Tap\u0161i\u1e96uni, Pu\u1e96iya(na), Ur\u1e96iya, and Ammiya.\nReligion.\nThe Hurrian culture made a great impact on the religion of the Hittites. From the Hurrian cult centre at Kummanni in Kizzuwatna, Hurrian religion spread to the Hittite people. Syncretism merged the Old Hittite and Hurrian religions. Hurrian religion spread to Syria, where Baal became the counterpart of Teshub. The Hurrian religion, in different forms, influenced the entire ancient Near East, except ancient Egypt and southern Mesopotamia.\nWhile the Hurrian and Urartian languages are related, there is little similarity between corresponding systems of belief.\nThe main gods in the Hurrian pantheon were:\nHurrian cylinder seals often depict mythological creatures such as winged humans or animals, dragons and other monsters. The interpretation of these depictions of gods and demons remains uncertain. They may have been both protective and evil spirits. Some are reminiscent of the Assyrian shedu.\nThe Hurrian gods do not appear to have had particular home temples, like in the Mesopotamian or Ancient Egyptian religion. Some important cult centres were Kummanni in Kizzuwatna and Hittite Yazilikaya. Harran was at least later a religious centre for the moon god, and Shauskha had an important temple in Nineve, when the city was under Hurrian rule. A temple of Nergal was built in Urkesh in the late third millennium BC. The town of Kahat was a religious centre in the kingdom of Mitanni.\nThe Hurrian myth \"The Songs of Ullikummi\", preserved among the Hittites, is a parallel to Hesiod's \"Theogony\"; the castration of Uranus by Cronus may be derived from the castration of Anu by Kumarbi, while Zeus's overthrow of Cronus and Cronus's regurgitation of the swallowed gods is like the Hurrian myth of Teshub and Kumarbi. It has been argued that the worship of Attis drew on Hurrian myth.\nLanguage.\nThe agglutinating and highly ergative Hurrian language is related to the Urartian language, the language of the ancient kingdom of Urartu. Together they form the Hurro-Urartian language family. The external connections of the Hurro-Urartian languages are disputed. There exist various proposals for a genetic relationship to other language families (e.g., the Northeast Caucasian languages), but none of these are generally accepted.\nThe Hurrians adopted the Akkadian language and Cuneiform script for their own writing about 2000 BC. Texts in the Hurrian language in cuneiform have been found at Hattusa, Ugarit (Ras Shamra), as well as in one of the longest of the Amarna letters (EA 27), written by King Tushratta of Mitanni to Pharaoh Amenhotep III. It was the only long Hurrian text known until a multi-tablet collection of literature in Hurrian with a Hittite translation was discovered at Hattusa in 1983.\nArchaeology.\nHurrian settlements are distributed over three modern countries, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. The heart of the Hurrian world is bisected by the modern border between Syria and Turkey. Several sites are situated within the border zone, making access for excavations problematic. A threat to the ancient sites are the many dam projects in the Euphrates, Tigris and Khabur valleys. Several rescue operations have already been undertaken when the construction of dams put entire river valleys under water.\nThe first major excavations of Hurrian sites in Iraq and Syria began in the 1920s and 1930s. They were led by the American archaeologist Edward Chiera at Yorghan Tepe (Nuzi), and the British archaeologist Max Mallowan at Chagar Bazar and Tell Brak. Recent excavations and surveys in progress are conducted by American, Belgian, Danish, Dutch, French, German and Italian teams of archaeologists, with international participants, in cooperation with the Syrian Department of Antiquities. The tells, or city mounds, often reveal a long occupation beginning in the Neolithic and ending in the Roman period or later. The characteristic Hurrian pottery, the Khabur ware, is helpful in determining the different strata of occupation within the mounds. The Hurrian settlements are usually identified from the Middle Bronze Age to the end of the Late Bronze Age, with Tell Mozan (Urkesh) being the main exception.\nImportant sites.\nThe list includes some important ancient sites from the area dominated by the Hurrians. Excavation reports and images are found at the websites linked. As noted above, important discoveries of Hurrian culture and history were also made at Alalakh, Amarna, Hattusa and Ugarit.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He won three Pulitzer Prizes, for the novel \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\" and for the plays \"Our Town\" and \"The Skin of Our Teeth\", and a U.S. National Book Award for the novel \"The Eighth Day\".\nEarly life and education.\nWilder was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of Amos Parker Wilder, a newspaper editor and later a U.S. diplomat, and Isabella Thornton Niven.\nWilder had four siblings as well as a twin who was stillborn. All of the surviving Wilder children spent part of their childhood in China when their father was stationed in Hong Kong and Shanghai as U.S. Consul General. Thornton's older brother, Amos Niven Wilder, became Hollis Professor of Divinity at the Harvard Divinity School. He was a noted poet and was instrumental in developing the field of theopoetics. Their sister Isabel Wilder was an accomplished writer. They had two more sisters, Charlotte Wilder, a poet, and Janet Wilder Dakin, a zoologist.\nEducation.\nWilder began writing plays while at the Thacher School in Ojai, California, where he did not fit in and was teased by classmates as overly intellectual. According to a classmate, \"We left him alone, just left him alone. And he would retire at the library, his hideaway, learning to distance himself from humiliation and indifference.\" His family lived for a time in China, where his sister Janet was born in 1910. He attended the English China Inland Mission Chefoo School at Yantai, but returned with his mother and siblings to California in 1912 because of the unstable political conditions in China at the time. Thornton graduated from Berkeley High School in 1915.\nWilder served a three-month enlistment in the U.S. Army's Coast Artillery Corps at Fort Adams in Rhode Island during World War I, eventually rising to the rank of corporal. He attended Oberlin College before earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1920 at Yale University, where he refined his writing skills as a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, a literary society. He earned his Master of Arts degree in French literature from Princeton University in 1926.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating, Wilder went to Italy and studied archaeology and Italian (1920\u201321) as part of an eight-month residency at The American Academy in Rome, and then taught French at the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, beginning in 1921. His first novel, https://, was published in 1926. In 1927, \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\" brought him commercial success and his first Pulitzer Prize (1928). He resigned from the Lawrenceville School in 1928. From 1930 to 1937, he taught at the University of Chicago, during which time he published his translation of Andr\u00e9 Obey's own adaptation of the tale \"Le Viol de Lucrece\" (1931) under the title \"Lucrece\" (Longmans Green, 1933). In Chicago, he became famous as a lecturer and was chronicled on the celebrity pages. In 1938, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his play \"Our Town\", and he won the prize again in 1943 for his play \"The Skin of Our Teeth\".\nWorld War II saw Wilder rise to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Air Force Intelligence, first in Africa, then in Italy until 1945. He received several awards for his military service. He went on to be a visiting professor at Harvard University, where he served for a year as the Charles Eliot Norton professor. Though he considered himself a teacher first and a writer second, he continued to write all his life, receiving the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1957 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963. In 1968 he won the National Book Award for his novel \"The Eighth Day\".\nProficient in four languages, Wilder translated plays by Andr\u00e9 Obey and Jean-Paul Sartre. He wrote the libretti of two operas, \"The Long Christmas Dinner\", composed by Paul Hindemith, and \"The Alcestiad\", composed by Louise Talma and based on his own play. Alfred Hitchcock, whom he admired, asked him to write the screenplay of his thriller \"Shadow of a Doubt\", and he completed a first draft for the film.\n\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\" (1927) tells the story of several unrelated people who happen to be on a bridge in Peru when it collapses, killing them. Philosophically, the book explores the question of why unfortunate events occur to people who seem \"innocent\" or \"undeserving\". It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928, and in 1998 it was selected by the editorial board of the American Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of the twentieth century. The book was quoted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair during the memorial service for victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Since then its popularity has grown enormously. The book is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and film-making, where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks to events before the disaster.\nWilder wrote \"Our Town\", a popular play (and later film) set in fictional Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. It was inspired in part by Dante's \"Purgatorio\" and in part by his friend Gertrude Stein's novel \"The Making of Americans\". Wilder suffered from writer's block while writing the final act. \"Our Town\" employs a choric narrator called the Stage Manager and a minimalist set to underscore the human experience. Wilder himself played the Stage Manager on Broadway for two weeks and later in summer stock productions. Following the daily lives of the Gibbs and Webb families, as well as the other inhabitants of Grover's Corners, the play illustrates the importance of the universality of the simple, yet meaningful lives of all people in the world in order to demonstrate the value of appreciating life. The play won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize.\nIn 1938, Max Reinhardt directed a Broadway production of \"The Merchant of Yonkers\", which Wilder had adapted from Austrian playwright Johann Nestroy's \"Einen Jux will er sich machen\" (1842). It was a failure, closing after 39 performances.\nHis play \"The Skin of Our Teeth\" opened in New York on November 18, 1942, featuring Fredric March and Tallulah Bankhead. Again, the themes are familiar \u2013 the timeless human condition; history as progressive, cyclical, or entropic; literature, philosophy, and religion as the touchstones of civilization. Three acts dramatize the travails of the Antrobus family, allegorizing the alternate history of mankind. It was claimed by Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson, authors of \"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\", that much of the play was the result of unacknowledged borrowing from James Joyce's last work.\nIn his novel \"The Ides of March\" (1948), Wilder reconstructed the characters and events leading to, and culminating in, the assassination of Julius Caesar. He had met Jean-Paul Sartre on a U.S. lecture tour after the war, and was under the influence of existentialism, although rejecting its atheist implications.\nIn 1954, Tyrone Guthrie encouraged Wilder to rework \"The Merchant of Yonkers\" into \"The Matchmaker\". This time the play opened in 1955 and enjoyed a healthy Broadway run of 486 performances with Ruth Gordon in the title role, winning a Tony Award for Guthrie, its director. It became the basis for the hit 1964 musical \"Hello, Dolly!\", with a book by Michael Stewart and score by Jerry Herman.\nIn 1960, Wilder was awarded the first ever Edward MacDowell Medal by The MacDowell Colony for outstanding contributions to American culture.\nIn 1962 and 1963, Wilder lived for 20 months in the small town of Douglas, Arizona, apart from family and friends. There he started his longest novel, \"The Eighth Day\", which went on to win the National Book Award. According to Harold Augenbraum in 2009, it \"attack[ed] the big questions head on, ... [embedded] in the story of small-town America\".\nHis last novel, \"Theophilus North\", was published in 1973, and made into the film \"Mr. North\" in 1988.\nThe Library of America republished all of Wilder's plays in 2007, together with some of his writings on the theater and the screenplay of \"Shadow of a Doubt\". In 2009, a second volume was released, containing his first five novels, six early stories, and four essays on fiction. Finally, the third and final volume in the Library of America series on Wilder was released in 2011, containing his last two novels \"The Eighth Day\" and \"Theophilus North\", as well as four autobiographical sketches.\nPersonal life.\nSix years after Wilder's death, Samuel Steward wrote in his autobiography that he had sexual relations with him. In 1937, Gertrude Stein had given Steward, then a college professor, a letter of introduction to Wilder. According to Steward, Alice B. Toklas told him that Wilder liked him and that Wilder had reported he was having trouble starting the third act of \"Our Town\" until he and Steward walked around Z\u00fcrich all night in the rain and the next day wrote the whole act, opening with a crowd in a rainy cemetery. Penelope Niven disputes Steward's claim of a relationship with Wilder and, based on Wilder's correspondence, says Wilder worked on the third act of \"Our Town\" over the course of several months and completed it several months before he first met Steward. Robert Gottlieb, reviewing Penelope Niven's work in \"The New Yorker\" in 2013, claimed Wilder had become infatuated with a man, not identified by Gottlieb, and Wilder's feelings were not reciprocated. Gottlieb asserted that \"Niven ties herself in knots in her discussion of Wilder's confusing sexuality\" and that \"His interest in women was unshakably nonsexual.\" He takes Steward's view that Wilder was a latent homosexual but never comfortable with sex.\nWilder had a wide circle of friends, including writers Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald, Toklas, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Stein; actress Ruth Gordon; fighter Gene Tunney; and socialite Sibyl, Lady Colefax.\nFrom the earnings of \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\", in 1930 Wilder had a house built for his family in Hamden, Connecticut, designed by Alice Trythall Washburn, one of the few female architects working at the time. His sister Isabel lived there for the rest of her life. This became his home base, although he traveled extensively and lived away for significant periods.\nDeath.\nWilder died of heart failure in his Hamden, Connecticut, house on December 7, 1975, at age 78. He is interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hamden.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "51685", "revid": "45397322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51685", "title": "Auxiliary verb", "text": "Verb adding grammatical meaning rather than content meaning\nAn auxiliary verb (abbreviated aux) is a verb that adds functional or grammatical meaning to the clause in which it occurs, so as to express tense, aspect, modality, voice, emphasis, etc. Auxiliary verbs usually accompany an infinitive verb or a participle, which respectively provide the main semantic content of the clause. An example is the verb \"have\" in the sentence \"I have finished my lunch.\" Here, the auxiliary \"have\" helps to express the perfect aspect along with the participle, \"finished\". Some sentences contain a chain of two or more auxiliary verbs. Auxiliary verbs are also called helping verbs, helper verbs, or (verbal) auxiliaries. Research has been conducted into split inflection in auxiliary verbs.\nBasic examples.\nBelow are some sentences that contain representative auxiliary verbs from English, Spanish, German and French, with the auxiliary verb marked in bold:\na. Do you want tea? \nb. She has given her best shot. \nc. He cogido tu l\u00e1piz. \n(I) have grabbed your pencil = 'I have taken your pencil.'\nd. Das wurde mehrmals gesagt. \nThat became many times said = 'That was said many times.'\ne. Sie ist nach Hause gegangen. \nShe is to home gone = 'She went home/She has gone home.'\nf. J'ai vu le soleil. \nI have seen the sun = 'I have seen the sun/I saw the sun.'\ng. Nous sommes h\u00e9berg\u00e9s par un ami. \nWe are hosted by a friend.\nThese auxiliaries help express a question, show tense/aspect, or form passive voice. Auxiliaries like these typically appear with a full verb that carries the main semantic content of the clause.\nTraits across languages.\nAuxiliary verbs typically help express grammatical tense, aspect, mood, and voice. They generally appear together with an infinitive. The auxiliary is said to \"help\" the infinitive. The auxiliary verbs of a language form a closed class, i.e., there is a fixed, relatively small number of them.\nWidely acknowledged verbs that can serve as auxiliaries in English and many related languages are the equivalents of \"be\" to express passive voice, and \"have\" (and sometimes \"be\") to express perfect aspect or past time reference.\nIn some treatments, the copula \"be\" is classed as an auxiliary even though it does not \"help\" another verb, e.g.,\nThe bird is in the tree. \nDefinitions of auxiliary verbs are not always consistent across languages, or even among authors discussing the same language. Modal verbs may or may not be classified as auxiliaries, depending on the language. In the case of English, verbs are often identified as auxiliaries based on their grammatical behavior, as described below. In some cases, verbs that function similarly to auxiliaries, but are not considered full members of that class (perhaps because they carry some independent lexical information), are called \"semi-auxiliaries\". In French, for example, verbs such as \"devoir\" (have to), \"pouvoir\" (be able to), \"aller\" (be going to), \"vouloir\" (want), \"faire\" (make), and \"laisser\" (let), when used together with the infinitive of another verb, can be called semi-auxiliaries. There has also been a study on auxiliary verb constructions in Dravidian languages.\nEnglish.\nThe following sections consider auxiliary verbs in English. They list auxiliary verbs, then present the diagnostics that motivate this special class (subject-auxiliary inversion and negation with \"not\"). The modal verbs are included in this class, due to their behavior with respect to these diagnostics.\nList of auxiliaries in English.\nA list of verbs that (can) function as auxiliaries in English is as follows:\n\"be\", \"can\", \"could\", \"dare\", \"do\", \"have\", \"may\", \"might\", \"mote\", \"must\", \"need\", \"ought\", \"shall\", \"should\", \"will\", \"would\"\nThe status of \"dare (not)\", \"need (not)\", and \"ought (to)\" is debatable and the use of these verbs as auxiliaries can vary across dialects of English. If the negative forms \"can't\", \"don't\", \"won't\", etc. are viewed as separate verbs (and not as contractions), then the number of auxiliaries increases. The verbs \"do\" and \"have\" can also function as full verbs or as light verbs, which can be a source of confusion about their status. The modal verbs (\"can\", \"could\", \"may\", \"might\", \"must\", \"shall\", \"should\", \"will\", \"would\", and \"dare\", \"need\" and \"ought\" when included) form a subclass of auxiliary verbs. Modal verbs are defective insofar as they cannot be inflected, nor do they appear as gerunds, infinitives, or participles.\nThe following table summarizes the auxiliary verbs in standard English and the meaning contribution to the clauses in which they appear. Many auxiliary verbs are listed more than once in the table based upon discernible differences in use.\nDeontic modality expresses an ability, necessity, or obligation that is associated with an agent subject. Epistemic modality expresses the speaker's assessment of reality or likelihood of reality. Distinguishing between the two types of modality can be difficult, since many sentences contain a modal verb that allows both interpretations.\nList of auxiliaries unique to African American Vernacular English.\nAfrican American Vernacular English makes a variety of finer tense/aspect distinctions than other dialects of English by making use of unique variant forms of, in particular: habitual 'be', reduced 'done' (d\u0259n), and stressed 'been' (BIN):\nDiagnostics for identifying auxiliary verbs in English.\nThe verbs listed in the previous section can be classified as auxiliaries based upon two diagnostics: they allow subject\u2013auxiliary inversion (the type of inversion used to form questions etc.) and (equivalently) they can take \"not\" as a postdependent (a dependent that follows its head). The following examples illustrate the extent to which subject\u2013auxiliary inversion can occur with an auxiliary verb but not with a full verb. (The asterisk * is the means commonly used in linguistics to indicate that the example is grammatically unacceptable or that a particular construction has never been attested in use).\na. He was working today.\nb. Was he working today? \na. He worked today.\nb. *Worked he today? \na. She can see it.\nb. Can she see it? \na. She sees it.\nb. *Sees she it? \nThe following examples illustrate that the negation \"not\" can appear as a postdependent of a finite auxiliary verb, but not as a postdependent of a finite full verb:\na. Sam would try that.\nb. Sam would not try that. \na. Sam tried that.\nb. *Sam tried not that. \na. Tom could help.\nb. Tom could not help. \na. Tom helped.\nb. *Tom helped not. \nA third diagnostic that can be used for identifying auxiliary verbs is verb phrase ellipsis. See the article on verb phrase ellipsis for examples.\nThese criteria lead to the copula \"be\" and non-copular use of \"be\" as an existential verb being considered an auxiliary (it undergoes inversion and takes postdependent \"not\", e.g., \"Is she the boss?\", \"She is not the boss\", \"Is there a God?\", \"There is a God\"). However, if one defines \"auxiliary verb\" as a verb that somehow \"helps\" another verb, then the copula \"be\" is not an auxiliary, because it appears without another verb. The literature on auxiliary verbs is somewhat inconsistent in this area.\nThere are also some properties that some but not all auxiliary verbs have. Their presence can be used to conclude that the verb is an auxiliary, but their absence does not guarantee the converse. One such property is to have the same form in the present tense, also for the first and the third person singular. This in particular is typical for \"modal\" auxiliary verbs, such as \"will\" and \"must\". (Examples: \"He will come tomorrow\", \"she must do it at once\", not \"he wills\" or \"she musts\".)\nLight verbs.\nSome syntacticians distinguish between auxiliary verbs and light verbs. The two are similar insofar as both verb types contribute mainly just functional information to the clauses in which they appear. Hence both do not qualify as separate predicates, but rather they form part of a predicate with another expression \u2013 usually with a full verb in the case of auxiliary verbs and usually with a noun in the case of light verbs.\nIn English, light verbs differ from auxiliary verbs in that they cannot undergo inversion and they cannot take \"not\" as a postdependent. The verbs \"have\" and \"do\" can function as auxiliary verbs or as light verbs (or as full verbs). When they are light verbs, they fail the inversion and negation diagnostics for auxiliaries, e.g.\nNote that in some dialects (for example, the West and South West dialects of Hiberno-English), the inversion test may sound correct to native speakers.\na.

Certain verbs (e.g., \"used to\", \"have to\", etc.) may be judged as light verbs by some authors, but as auxiliaries by others.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In his early teens, he studied drums with William Kessler, who was the ghostwriter for Cozy Cole, one of the famous big-band drummers. A few years later, he turned to the guitar.\nTeenage years.\nWhen Lloyd was in his middle teens, he met a fellow guitarist from Brooklyn named Velvert Turner. Turner claimed he knew Jimi Hendrix. Per Turner, Hendrix considered Turner his \"little brother\", and took him on as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, inviting him to various clubs and teaching him guitar from Hendrix's apartment on W 12th St. As Turner and Lloyd were best friends, Turner asked for permission to teach Lloyd what he was learning, and so Lloyd and Turner began practicing together under the teaching auspice of Hendrix. Lloyd frequently attended Hendrix's shows, as well as those of other well-known acts such as Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart, The Allman Brothers Band, and the Grateful Dead.\nAt Stuyvesant High School, during the 11th grade, Lloyd decided he wanted to become a well-known guitarist, so he stopped bringing his textbooks or homework to school and instead brought an electric guitar in a hardshell case. When his teachers would ask him where his schoolbooks were, he would point to the case. Being asked to open the case, the teachers would proclaim, \"I don't see any books in there only an electric guitar\", and Lloyd's retort was, \"That's the book I'm studying.\" He still managed to pass all of his tests but quit in May 1969, before graduation, because he did not believe in diplomas, and he considered that having a high school diploma would not do him any good in his pursuit of the music business. That summer his parents moved to Montclair, New Jersey, and gave him an ultimatum: he could either get a job or repeat the 12th grade in a new high school. He chose the latter, which led to his deep friendship with another guitarist named Al Anderson, who went on to be one of a couple of Americans to play in Bob Marley's touring band, The Wailers, along with Donald Kinsey.\nEarly music career.\nAfter quitting a second high school before graduation, he moved to Boston, where he lived for two years. It was during this time that he enjoyed his first public performance, sitting in with John Lee Hooker at the Jazz workshop on Boylston Street. By this time Lloyd had already met and knew Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Guy, and members of Led Zeppelin, and could be frequently found backstage conversing with his heroes. John Lee Hooker asked him what he did and Lloyd replied that he was a guitarist, whereupon John Lee Hooker called him over and whispered into his ear \"the secret of the electric guitar\" and invited him to sit in with the band. After living in Boston for a period of time, Lloyd moved back to New York, but desired to visit other centers of musical culture. He first decided to hitchhike across Route 66, but after considering how long it might take, he flew directly to Los Angeles instead. He spent the next two years in Los Angeles from 1971, practicing the electric guitar without an amplifier and attending record company parties, which were very ostentatious at that time. He lived as a roommate with Richard Cromelin, the music critic for the \"Los Angeles Times\", so again, he had access to the highest level and echelon of rock 'n roll.\nIn 1973, he heard about the New York Dolls and the beginning of a brand-new New York scene, so he arranged with a friend who owned a Lotus Europa to take him as a passenger across the country. As they made their way through the country, with stops in famous towns like Memphis and New Orleans, he reached New York and heard the unpleasant news that the Mercer Arts Center, known for hosting the first concerts of bands like the Dolls, the Modern Lovers and Suicide, had collapsed. He began frequenting shows at the Diplomat Hotel and other spots, and seeing the possibility of a new scene, began contemplating putting a band together. He met a fellow named Terry Ork at Max's Kansas City, who had a huge loft in Chinatown and needed a roommate, so Lloyd moved into Ork's Chinatown loft, living in the front room, a small room facing East Broadway. Ork worked for Andy Warhol making silkscreen prints at night and working at a theatrical poster shop called Cinemabilia during the daytime. Ork very much wanted to manage or create a band such as Warhol had done with The Velvet Underground. During discussions with Lloyd, Ork mentioned that he knew of another guitarist without a band who was auditioning a couple of songs at Reno Sweeney's audition night. Reno Sweeney's was an off-Broadway-style club on W. 13th St that mostly hosted singers like Peter Allen and Bette Midler.\nTelevision.\nOrk and Lloyd went to Reno Sweeney's one night during the summer of 1973, where Richard saw Tom Miller play three songs. Lloyd leaned over to Ork during the second song and told him that this fellow had something, but was missing something, and what he was missing, Lloyd had. He advised Ork that if Terry could convince Tom, the combination of Lloyd and Miller would make the band Terry Ork was looking for. This was the beginning of the formation of the band Television. Miller would eventually change his last name to Verlaine and Richard Meyers became Richard Hell and promised to learn the bass as they went along. With the addition of Billy Ficca on drums, the quartet was complete. Television rehearsed seven days a week for five or six hours a day during the fall and winter of 1973, and made their first public performance on March 2, 1974, at the Town House Theatre on W. 44th St.\nTelevision were looking for a club where they could develop an audience and play more often as the house band, when Verlaine spotted a guy putting up the awning on a bar on the Bowery which stood under a flophouse for homeless alcoholics. Verlaine and Lloyd went back up and discussed the possibility of playing in this new club, which was to be called CBGB. After Television's manager Ork promised CBGB a large take at the bar, Television was given a gig at the end of March 1974. CBGB was run by Hilly Kristal, who had planned to feature country, bluegrass and blues (CBGB) at the club, but when several original rock bands like Blondie, the Ramones and Talking Heads started to show up after finding out that there was a place to play, Ork became the official booking agent for the club. CBGB started to get noticed after bands like Television and Talking Heads started to fill the place up, and when a young poet named Patti Smith began playing double bills with Television, the club started becoming famous. CBGB closed its doors in New York in 2007.\nAfter recording demos for various record companies, Richard Hell left the band and was replaced by Blondie's bass player at the time, Fred Smith. Fred Smith's solid bass playing allowed for a more transcendent and profound music from the two guitarists and drummer, resulting in their being signed to Elektra Records in 1977.\nTelevision recorded two albums for Elektra: \"Marquee Moon\" and \"Adventure\". As a debut release in 1977, \"Marquee Moon\" remains on lists of greatest albums in rock and roll history, and never has been out of print.\nAfter recording \"Adventure\" in 1978, and finding success elusive in the United States, Television disbanded after a successful series of dates at New York's The Bottom Line. The various members went their separate ways, although all of them continued in the music industry, occasionally to reunite.\nSolo career.\nIn 1978, a single of Lloyd's song, \"I Thought You Wanted to Know,\" was released with guitar and harmony vocal by an uncredited Lloyd and lead vocal, bass, and piano by Chris Stamey. The release was credited to Chris Stamey and the dB's, although Stamey was the only dB to appear on the recording. \nAfter Television first disbanded in 1978, Lloyd released a solo album for Elektra Records, titled \"Alchemy\". His solo career has included work as a guitarist and session musician for various artists including Matthew Sweet, John Doe (of the band X), and Swiss singer-songwriter Stephan Eicher. In 1990, Lloyd recorded a version of the Roky Erickson/13th Floor Elevators song \"Fire Engine\", which was included on the tribute album compilation \"Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye\". In 1991 he contributed guitar parts to Matthew Sweet's critically-acclaimed album \"Girlfriend\".\nHe is known to teach other aspiring guitarists in his studio in New York City, where he frequently produces other acts. He acted as producer, recording engineer and band member on the Rocket from the Tombs album \"Rocket Redux\", released on Smog Veil Records. He has also produced a number of records for other New York bands, including The Blondes, Inc., Christopher Purdy, Miss Mother USA and Kevin Otto; as well as \"Skinny Girls Are Trouble\" (2010), the third album by country-punk songwriter Jim Neversink. His other current projects include a reformation of Rocket from the Tombs. He still owns the famous pinstriped Stratocaster he played with Television.\nIn 1994, he was cast by Cynthia Plaster Caster.\nAs of 2016, Lloyd has released seven solo albums, beginning with \"Alchemy\" in 1979, \"Field of Fire\" in 1986 (reissued in 2007 with an additional disc of music), the live disc \"Real Time\" in 1987 (recorded at CBGB) and \"The Cover Doesn't Matter\" in 2001. \"The Radiant Monkey\" was released on Parasol Records in late 2007. The CD features Lloyd on everything but drums (played by session drummer Chris Purdy, with Television's Billy Ficca on one track). \"The Jamie Neverts Story\", released on Parasol in 2009, was Lloyd's tribute to his hero, Jimi Hendrix; and was dedicated to the memory of his friend Velvert Turner; \"Jamie Neverts\" was the secret name that Velvert and Lloyd came up with to prevent all the kids in the neighborhood from trying to come along when they went to see Hendrix.\nIn 2010, he released \"Lodestones\", sometimes referred to as \"Nuggets From the Vault\". It was issued on vinyl in 2018 for Record Store Day. Of the album, Lloyd said: \"I found a large box of unmarked cassettes going back quite a few years. When I began listening to them, I found a number of finished products \u2013 songs that for some reason I [had] failed to put on records. [I] got a machine to transfer the cassettes to CDs and I transferred [the] CDs to my machine at my studio and mastered them. When finished I had a 10 song record.\". According to Lloyd's website, other players on the record are John Klages and David Leonard on rhythm guitar, and most likely Steve Cohen on bass and Ed Shockley on drums. In 2016, he released \"Rosedale\". While Lloyd plays all the instruments on most of the album, Billy Ficca and Chris Frantz also play on a few tracks, and local musicians bassist Terry Clouse and drummer Jeff Brakebill from his new hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee, are also featured. In 2018, Lloyd published his memoir, \"Everything Is Combustible: Television, CBGB's and Five Decades of Rock and Roll.\"\nPersonal life.\nIn 2015, Lloyd married Sheila O'Keefe. His memoir notes he has a son, Dylan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "51691", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51691", "title": "Stanley Unwin (comedian)", "text": "British comic actor and writer (1911\u20132002)\nStanley Unwin (7 June 1911 \u2013 12 January 2002), sometimes known as Professor Stanley Unwin, was a British comic actor and writer.\nHe invented his own comic language, \"Unwinese\", referred to in the film \"Carry On Regardless\" (1961) as \"gobbledygook\". Unwinese was a corrupted form of English in which many of the words were altered in playful and humorous ways, as in its description of Elvis Presley and his contemporaries as being \"wasp-waist and swivel-hippy\". Unwin claimed that the inspiration came from his mother, who once told him that on the way home she had \"falolloped (fallen) over\" and \"grazed her kneeclabbers\".\nEarly life.\nUnwin's parents, Ivan Oswald Unwin (1880\u20131914) and his wife Jessie Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Brand; 1883\u20131968) emigrated from England to the Union of South Africa in the early 1900s. Their son was born in Pretoria in 1911. Following his father's death in 1914, due to the family's poverty Unwin's mother arranged for the family to return to England. She worked as a cook at Bow Road police station. By 1919, Unwin had been sent to the National Children's Home in Congleton, Cheshire. In the late 1920s, he studied radio, television and languages at Regent Street Polytechnic in London.\nIn 1937, he married Frances, with whom he had two daughters and a son. Unwin later stated that Unwinese had its roots in enlivening the bedtime stories that he used to tell his children. In 1940, he was given a job in transmitter maintenance for the BBC, and was assigned to the Borough Hill transmitting station in Daventry. Unwin, Frances and their nine-month-old daughter, Marion, moved to Long Buckby in Northamptonshire, where Unwin would reside for the rest of his life.\nComedy career.\nUnwin's early career and training introduced him to wireless and radio communication, and this, coupled with work in the BBC's War Reporting Unit from about 1944, ultimately proved to be his passage into the media.\nWhile based in Birmingham from 1947 to 1951, Unwin made his first, accidental, transmission. While testing equipment, he gave the microphone to broadcaster F.R. \"Buck\" Buckley, who ad-libbed a spoof commentary about an imaginary sport called \"Fasche\". Buckley then introduced Unwin as \"Codlington Corthusite\", whereupon Unwin continued the sketch in Unwinese. The recording was broadcast on Pat Dixon's \"Mirror of the Month\" programme and a favourable audience reaction led to the commissioning of another sketch in which Unwin, playing an inhabitant of Atlantis, was interviewed about life in the sunken city. A letter of praise from Joyce Grenfell, whom Unwin admired, gave him confidence and he determined on a career in show business.\nAfter the war, while in Egypt and recording a series of shows by Frankie Howerd, Unwin stood in for the comedian when Howerd fell ill. Unwin's next major breakthrough came when producer Roy Speer introduced him to the comedian Ted Ray. Once Ray had heard Unwin talking, he said simply: \"I want him in the series\"\u00a0\u2013 namely, \"The Spice of Life\", co-starring June Whitfield and Kenneth Connor. During the mid-1950s, Unwin performed in about a dozen shows for Speer and made the acquaintance of Johnnie Riscoe and his daughter, Patsy, who would become his managers for the rest of his career. By the end of the 1950s, Unwin had ventured into the film industry, being given a part in the Cardew Robinson film \"Fun at St. Fanny's\" (1956).\nIn December 1959 Unwin appeared with Steve Race in a Boxing Day edition of the BBC Light Programme's \"Just Jazz\" in an early evening Saturday broadcast of the jazz record programme as \"Professor Stanley Unwin, Professor of Jazz Studies at Brewflade University\".\nIn 1968, Unwin was invited to narrate \"Happiness Stan\", a six song fairy tale about a boy of the same name, taking up the entire side two of the Small Faces' album \"Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake\", which reached number 1 in the UK Albums Chart.\nIn 1969, Unwin appeared in Gerry Anderson's \"Supermarionation\" TV series \"The Secret Service\", both in person and as the voice of the puppet character Father Stanley Unwin, whose appearance was based on him. Episodes typically comprised one or more scenes in which the character of Unwin would attempt to baffle opponents with his gobbledegook. When Lew Grade, Anderson's financial backer and head of distributor ITC, was introduced to the Unwinese dialogue, he cancelled the production on the basis that he believed viewers would not understand what Unwin was saying, despite the fact that such confusion was intentional.\nThough professionally retired in his later decades, Unwin still continued to make occasional appearances. In the 1970s, he appeared on \"The Max Bygraves Show\" on ITV, sometimes speaking normally and sometimes in gobbledegook. In the final episode, Bygraves tested a number of gobbledegook phrases on Unwin, who claimed that he could not understand them. In 1985, Unwin recorded with Suns of Arqa on their album \"Ark of the Arqans\", providing spoken word accompaniment in Unwinese on the first three tracks. In 1987, he recorded again with Suns of Arqa on their track \"Erasmus Meets The Earthling\", featured on their album \"Seven\", and a remixed version of this track was released again in the 1990s. He appeared as himself in a hospital scene of Inside Victor Lewis-Smith. In 1994, Unwin collaborated with British dance music act Wubble-U on their single \"Petal\"; on its re-release in 1998, the track ranked number 55 in the UK Chart. In 1998, Unwin made a cameo appearance in the Aardman Animations series \"Rex the Runt\", as an accountant who speaks largely in fairly standard English, occasionally lapsing inexplicably into Unwinese.\nUnwinese.\nUnwinese, also known as \"Basic Engly Twenty Fido\", was an ornamented and mangled form of English in which many of the words were deliberately corrupted in a playful and humorous manner, but which was still largely comprehensible to the listener. Unwin's performances could be hilarious yet disorientating, where the meaning and context were conveyed in a disguised and picturesque style. For example, in his talk on music, \"Populode of the Musicolly\", Unwin says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They do in fact go back to Ethelrebbers Unready, King Albert's burnt capers where, you know, the toast fell in and the dear lady did get a very cross knit and smote him across the eardrome excallybold. The great sword which riseyhuff and Merlin forevermore was the beginning of the Great Constitution of the Englishspeaking peeploders of these islone, oh yes.\nUnwinese has been compared to Lewis Carroll's nonsense poetry, such as \"Jabberwocky\", where the sentences sound superficially like English when read aloud, but their precise meaning is unclear.\nSelected works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDeath and legacy.\nUnwin died at Danetre Hospital in Daventry on 12 January 2002. He is buried in the churchyard at Long Buckby, with Frances, who predeceased him in 1993. Their gravestone bears the epitaph, \"Reunitey in the heavenly-bode\u00a0\u2013 Deep Joy!\".\nA thanksgiving service was held at St Lawrence's Church in Long Buckby and ended with a rendering of \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" by John Percival and friends. The valediction had been prepared by Unwin's family in his own style: \"Goodly Byelode loyal peeploders! Now all gatherymost to amuse it and have a tilty elbow or a nice cuffle-oteedee\u00a0\u2013 Oh Yes!\"\nSuns of Arqa released a tribute album to Unwin (entitled \"Tributey\") following his death, featuring a selection of his works with the band over the years, as well as various interviews.\nUnwin's work is considered to have been a significant influence on the two books written by John Lennon: \"In His Own Write\" (1964) and \"A Spaniard in the Works\" (1965).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cook scripted a conversation between two men from Dagenham wearing flat caps. This proved to be very popular with television audiences and the partnership was continued during the series \"Not Only... But Also\".\nPete is a know-it-all and would-be intellectual, very much in the spirit of E. L. Wisty, and Dud is a put-upon Herbert in a subservient role, who tries to impress Pete with his knowledge. Neither of them has any real sense.\nThe \"Dagenham Dialogues\" between the two ranged from paintings (Pete finds the Mona Lisa snooty, and the bottoms of Rubens's nudes seem to follow them around the room), reasons why geckos do not live long and being annoyed by film stars (including \"bloody Greta Garbo\" and \"bloody Anna Magnani\") pestering them for romance.\nDuring the 1970s, Cook and Moore used a similar formula for the more adult Derek and Clive recordings.\nThe comic and personal relationship between Cook and Moore is the subject of the play \"\", by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde. In 2010, a group of comedians, Hugh Dennis, Angus Deayton and Alistair McGowan among them, recreated some of the Pete and Dud comic routines on BBC Two in \"Pete and Dud: the Lost Sketches\".\nRecalling his relationship with David Bowie, English musician Brian Eno has stated \"We knew each other for over 40 years, in a friendship that was always tinged by echoes of Pete and Dud.\u201d. Eno has recalled that during the recording sessions for Bowie's \"Heroes\" album, he and Bowie would communicate in Peter Cook and Dudley Moore voices: \"We slipped into Peter Cook and Dudley Moore characters.

In the early part of his reign, his realms and territories were referred to as the Austrian Empire, but in 1867 they were reconstituted as the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. From 1 May 1850 to 24 August 1866, he was also president of the German Confederation.\nIn December 1848, Franz Joseph's uncle Emperor Ferdinand I abdicated the throne at Olomouc, as part of Minister President Felix zu Schwarzenberg's plan to end the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Franz Joseph then acceded to the throne. In 1854, he married his first cousin Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria, with whom he had four children: Sophie, Gisela, Rudolf, and Marie Valerie. Largely considered to be a reactionary, Franz Joseph spent his early reign resisting constitutionalism in his domains. The Austrian Empire was forced to cede its influence over Tuscany and most of its claim to Lombardy\u2013Venetia to the Kingdom of Sardinia, following the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 and the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. Although Franz Joseph ceded no territory to the Kingdom of Prussia after the Austrian defeat in the Austro-Prussian War, the Peace of Prague (23 August 1866) settled the German Question in favour of Prussia, which prevented the unification of Germany from occurring under the House of Habsburg.\nFranz Joseph was troubled by nationalism throughout his reign. He concluded the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which granted greater autonomy to Hungary and created the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. He ruled peacefully for the next 45 years, but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in 1867, the suicide of his son Rudolf in 1889, and the assassinations of his wife Elisabeth in 1898 and his nephew and heir presumptive, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in 1914.\nAfter the Austro-Prussian War, Austria-Hungary turned its attention to the Balkans, which was a hotspot of international tension because of conflicting interests of Austria with not only the Ottoman but also the Russian Empire. The Bosnian Crisis was a result of Franz Joseph's annexation in 1908 of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had already been occupied by his troops since the Congress of Berlin (1878). On 28 June 1914, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo resulted in Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against the Kingdom of Serbia, which was an ally of the Russian Empire. This activated a system of alliances declaring war on each other, which resulted in World War I. Franz Joseph died in 1916, after ruling his domains for almost 68 years. He was succeeded by his grandnephew Charles I &amp; IV.\nEarly life.\nFranz Joseph was born on 18 August 1830 in the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace in Vienna (on the 65th anniversary of the death of Francis of Lorraine) as the eldest son of Archduke Franz Karl (the younger son of Francis I), and Sophie, Princess of Bavaria. Because his uncle, reigning from 1835 as the Emperor Ferdinand, was disabled by seizures, and his father unambitious and retiring, the mother of the young Archduke \"Franzi\" brought him up as a future emperor, with emphasis on devotion, responsibility and diligence.\nFor this reason, Franz Joseph was consistently built up as a potential successor to the imperial throne by his politically ambitious mother from early childhood.\nUp to the age of 7, little \"Franzi\" was brought up in the care of the nanny (\"Aja\") Louise von Sturmfeder. Then the \"state education\" began, the central contents of which were \"sense of duty\", religiosity and dynastic awareness. The theologian Joseph Othmar von Rauscher conveyed to him the inviolable understanding of rulership of divine origin (divine grace), and therefore a belief that no participation of the population in rulership in the form of parliaments was required.\nThe educators Heinrich Franz von Bombelles and Colonel Johann Baptist Coronini-Cronberg ordered Archduke Franz to study an enormous amount of time, which initially comprised 18 hours per week and was expanded to 50 hours per week by the age of 16. One of the main focuses of the lessons was language acquisition: in addition to French, the diplomatic language of the time, Latin and Ancient Greek, Hungarian, Czech, Italian and Polish were the most important national languages of the monarchy. In addition, the archduke received general education that was customary at the time (including mathematics, physics, history, geography), which was later supplemented by law and political science. Various forms of physical education completed the extensive program.\nOn his 13th birthday, Franz Joseph was appointed Colonel-Inhaber of Dragoon Regiment No. 3 and the focus of his training shifted to imparting basic strategic and tactical knowledge. From that point onward, army style dictated his personal fashion\u2014for the rest of his life, he normally wore the uniform of a military officer. Franz Joseph was soon joined by three younger brothers: Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian (born 1832, the future Emperor Maximilian of Mexico); Archduke Karl Ludwig (born 1833, father of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria), and Archduke Ludwig Viktor (born 1842), and a sister, Archduchess Maria Anna (born 1835), who died at the age of 4.\nRevolutions of 1848.\nDuring the Revolutions of 1848, the Austrian Chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich resigned (March\u2013April 1848). The young archduke, who (it was widely expected) would soon succeed his uncle on the throne, was appointed Governor of Bohemia on 6 April 1848, but never took up the post. Sent instead to the front in Italy, he joined Field Marshal Radetzky on campaign on 29 April, receiving his baptism of fire on 5 May at Santa Lucia.\nBy all accounts, he handled his first military experience calmly and with dignity. Around the same time, the imperial family was fleeing revolutionary Vienna for the calmer setting of Innsbruck, in Tyrol. Called back from Italy, the archduke joined the rest of his family at Innsbruck by mid-June. It was here that Franz Joseph first met his cousin and eventual future bride, Elisabeth, then a girl of 10, but apparently the meeting made little impression.\nFollowing Austria's victory over the Italians at Custoza in late July 1848, the court felt it safe to return to Vienna, and Franz Joseph travelled with them. But within a few weeks, Vienna again appeared unsafe, and in September, the court left once more, this time for Olm\u00fctz in Moravia. By now, Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz, an influential military commander in Bohemia, was determined to see the young archduke soon put on the throne. It was thought that a new ruler would not be bound by the oaths to respect constitutional government to which Ferdinand had been forced to agree, and that it was necessary to find a young, energetic emperor to replace the kindly but mentally unfit Ferdinand.\nBy the abdication of his uncle Ferdinand and the renunciation of his father (the mild-mannered Franz Karl), Franz Joseph succeeded as Emperor of Austria at Olm\u00fctz on 2 December 1848. At this time, he first became known by his second as well as his first Christian name. The name \"Franz Joseph\" was chosen to bring back memories of the new Emperor's great-granduncle, Emperor Joseph II (Holy Roman Emperor from 1765 to 1790), remembered as a modernising reformer.\nUnder the guidance of the new prime minister, Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, the new emperor at first pursued a cautious course, granting a constitution in March 1849. At the same time, a military campaign was necessary against the Hungarians, who had rebelled against Habsburg central authority in the name of their ancient constitution. Franz Joseph was also almost immediately faced with a renewal of the fighting in Italy, with King Charles Albert of Sardinia taking advantage of setbacks in Hungary to resume the war in March 1849.\nHowever, the military tide began to turn swiftly in favor of Franz Joseph and the Austrian whitecoats. Almost immediately, Charles Albert was decisively beaten by Radetzky at Novara and forced to sue for peace, as well as to renounce his throne.\nRevolution in Hungary.\nUnlike other Habsburg ruled areas, the Kingdom of Hungary had an old historic constitution, which limited the power of the crown and had greatly increased the authority of the parliament since the 13th century.\nThe Hungarian reform laws (April laws) were based on the 12 points that established the fundaments of modern civil and political rights, economic and societal reforms in the Kingdom of Hungary. The crucial turning point of the Hungarian events were the April laws which was ratified by his uncle King Ferdinand, however the new young Austrian monarch Francis Joseph arbitrarily \"revoked\" the laws without any legal competence. The monarchs had no right to revoke Hungarian parliamentary laws which were already signed. This unconstitutional act irreversibly escalated the conflict between the Hungarian parliament and Francis Joseph. The Austrian Stadion Constitution was accepted by the Imperial Diet of Austria, where Hungary had no representation, and which traditionally had no legislative power in the territory of Kingdom of Hungary; despite this, it also tried to abolish the Diet of Hungary (which existed as the supreme legislative power in Hungary since the late 12th century.)\nThe new Austrian constitution also went against the historical constitution of Hungary, and even tried to nullify it. Even the territorial integrity of the country was in danger: On 7 March 1849, an imperial proclamation was issued in the name of the Emperor Francis Joseph, according to the new proclamation, the territory of Kingdom of Hungary would be carved up and administered by five military districts, while the Principality of Transylvania would be reestablished. These events represented a clear and obvious existential threat for the Hungarian state. The new constrained Stadion Constitution of Austria, the revocation of the April laws and the Austrian military campaign against the Kingdom of Hungary resulted in the fall of the pacifist Batthy\u00e1ny government (which sought agreement with the court) and led to the sudden emergence of Lajos Kossuth's followers in the Hungarian parliament, who demanded the full independence of Hungary. The Austrian military intervention in the Kingdom of Hungary resulted in strong anti-Habsburg sentiment among Hungarians, thus the events in Hungary grew into a war for total independence from the Habsburg dynasty.\nConstitutional and legitimacy problems in Hungary.\nOn 7 December 1848, the Diet of Hungary formally refused to acknowledge the title of the new king, \"as without the knowledge and consent of the diet no one could sit on the Hungarian throne\", and called the nation to arms. While in most Western European countries (like France and the United Kingdom) the monarch's reign began immediately upon the death of their predecessor, in Hungary the coronation was indispensable; if it were not properly executed, the kingdom remained \"orphaned\".\nEven during the long personal union between the Kingdom of Hungary and other Habsburg ruled areas, the Habsburg monarchs had to be crowned as King of Hungary in order to promulgate laws there or exercise royal prerogatives in the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary. From a legal point of view, according to the coronation oath, a crowned Hungarian king could not relinquish the Hungarian throne during his life; if the king was alive and unable to do his duty as ruler, a governor (or regent, as they would be called in English) had to assume the royal duties. Constitutionally, Franz Joseph's uncle Ferdinand was still the legal king of Hungary. If there was no possibility to inherit the throne automatically due to the death of the predecessor king (since King Ferdinand was still alive), but the monarch wanted to relinquish his throne and appoint another king before his death, technically only one legal solution remained: the parliament had the power to dethrone the king and elect a new king. Due to the legal and military tensions, the Hungarian parliament did not grant Franz Joseph that favour. This event gave to the revolt an excuse of legality. Actually, from this time until the collapse of the revolution, Lajos Kossuth (as elected regent-president) became the de facto and de jure ruler of Hungary.\nMilitary difficulties in Hungary.\nWhile the revolutions in the Austrian territories had been suppressed by 1849 in Hungary, the situation was more severe and Austrian defeat seemed imminent. Sensing a need to secure his right to rule, Franz Joseph sought help from Russia, requesting the intervention of Tsar Nicholas I, in order \"to prevent the Hungarian insurrection developing into a European calamity\". For the Russian military support, Franz Joseph kissed the hand of the tsar in Warsaw on 21 May 1849. Tsar Nicholas supported Franz Joseph in the name of the Holy Alliance, and sent a 200,000 strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces led by General Ivan Paskevich. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces. After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under brutal martial law. This led to the death of Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny and executions in Arad. \nWith order now restored throughout his empire, Franz Joseph felt free to renege on the constitutional concessions he had made, especially as the Austrian parliament meeting at Kremsier had behaved\u2014in the young Emperor's eyes\u2014abominably. The 1849 constitution was suspended, and a policy of absolutist centralism was established, guided by the Minister of the Interior, Alexander Bach.\nAssassination attempt in 1853.\nOn 18 February 1853, Franz Joseph survived an assassination attempt by Hungarian nationalist J\u00e1nos Lib\u00e9nyi. The emperor was taking a stroll with one of his officers, Count Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell, on a city bastion, when Lib\u00e9nyi approached him. He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck. Franz Joseph almost always wore a uniform, which had a high collar that almost completely enclosed the neck. The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material, precisely to counter this kind of attack. Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life. Count O'Donnell struck Lib\u00e9nyi down with his sabre.\nO'Donnell, hitherto a Count only by virtue of his Irish nobility, was made a Count of the Habsburg monarchy (\"Reichsgraf\"). Another witness who happened to be nearby, the butcher Joseph Ettenreich, swiftly overpowered Lib\u00e9nyi. For his deed he was later elevated to the nobility by the emperor and became Joseph von Ettenreich. Lib\u00e9nyi was subsequently put on trial and condemned to death for attempted regicide. He was executed on the Simmeringer Heide.\nAfter this unsuccessful attack, the emperor's brother Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian called upon Europe's royal families for donations to construct a new church on the site of the attack. The church was to be a votive offering for the survival of the emperor. It is located on Ringstra\u00dfe in the district of Alsergrund close to the University of Vienna, and is known as the Votivkirche. The survival of Franz Joseph was also commemorated in Prague by erecting a new statue of St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of the emperor, on Charles Bridge. It was donated by Count Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky, the first minister-president of the Austrian Empire.\nConsolidation of domestic policy.\nThe next few years saw the seeming recovery of Austria's position on the international scene following the near disasters of 1848\u20131849. Under Schwarzenberg's guidance, Austria was able to stymie Prussian scheming to create a new German Federation under Prussian leadership, excluding Austria. After Schwarzenberg's premature death in 1852, he could not be replaced by statesmen of equal stature, and the emperor himself effectively took over as prime minister. He established absolutist rule by issuing the March Constitution (Austria) in 1849. This was in turn revoked by the \"\". Seeking to borrow money on foreign markets, he relented and issued the February Patent in 1861 which established the Empire's constitution. \nHe was one of the most prominent Roman Catholic rulers in Europe, and a fierce enemy of Freemasonry.\nAustro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\nThe 1850s witnessed several failures of Austrian external policy: the Crimean War, the dissolution of its alliance with Russia, and defeat in the Second Italian War of Independence. The setbacks continued in the 1860s with defeat in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, which resulted in the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\nThe Hungarian political leaders had two main goals during the negotiations. One was to regain the traditional status (both legal and political) of the Hungarian state, which was lost after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The other was to restore the series of reform laws of the revolutionary parliament of 1848, which were based on the 12 points that established modern civil and political rights, economic and societal reforms in Hungary.\nThe Compromise partially re-established the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hungary, separate from, and no longer subject to the Austrian Empire. Instead, it was regarded as an equal partner with Austria. The compromise put an end to 18 years of absolutist rule and military dictatorship which had been introduced by Francis Joseph after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Franz Joseph was crowned King of Hungary on 8 June, and on 28 July he promulgated the laws that officially turned the Habsburg domains into the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. \nAccording to Emperor Franz Joseph, \"There were three of us who made the agreement: De\u00e1k, Andr\u00e1ssy and myself.\" However, the role of Empress Elisabeth (Sisi) cannot be understated in facilitating this compromise. Fluent in Hungarian and deeply sympathetic to the Hungarian cause, Elisabeth fostered close relationships with Hungarian leaders, including Count Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy, and worked behind the scenes to persuade Francis Joseph to adopt a more conciliatory approach. Her influence helped build the trust necessary for successful negotiations, and her personal popularity in Hungary significantly bolstered the monarchy's legitimacy in the region.\nPolitical difficulties in Austria mounted continuously through the late 19th century and into the 20th century. However, Franz Joseph remained immensely respected; the emperor's patriarchal authority held the Empire together while the politicians squabbled among themselves.\nBohemian question.\nFollowing the accession of Franz Joseph to the throne in 1848, the political representatives of the Kingdom of Bohemia hoped and insisted that account should be taken of their historical state rights in the upcoming constitution. They felt the position of Bohemia within the Habsburg monarchy should have been highlighted by a coronation of the new ruler to the king of Bohemia in Prague (the last coronation took place in 1836). However, before the 19th century the Habsburgs had ruled Bohemia by hereditary right and a separate coronation was not deemed necessary.\nHis new government installed the system of neoabsolutism in Austrian internal affairs to make the Austrian Empire a unitary, centralised and bureaucratically administered state. When Franz Joseph returned to constitutional rule after the debacles in Italy at Magenta and Solferino and summoned the diets of his lands, the question of his coronation as king of Bohemia again returned to the agenda, as it had not since 1848. On 14 April 1861, Emperor Franz Joseph received a delegation from the Bohemian Diet with his words (in Czech):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn contrast to his predecessor Emperor Ferdinand (who spent the rest of his life after his abdication in 1848 in Bohemia and especially in Prague), Franz Joseph was never crowned separately as king of Bohemia. In 1861, the negotiations failed because of unsolved constitutional problems. However, in 1866, a visit of the monarch to Prague following defeat at the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz was a huge success, testified by the considerable numbers of new photographs taken.\nIn 1867, the Austro-Hungarian compromise and the introduction of the dual monarchy left the Czechs and their aristocracy without the recognition of separate Bohemian state rights for which they had hoped. Bohemia remained part of the Austrian Crown Lands. In Bohemia, opposition to dualism took the form of isolated street demonstrations, resolutions from district representations, and even open air mass protest meetings, confined to the biggest cities, such as Prague. The Czech newspaper \"N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy\" complained that the Czechs had not yet been compensated for their wartime losses and sufferings during the Austro-Prussian War, and had just seen their historic state rights tossed aside and their land subsumed into the \"other\" half of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, commonly called \"Cisleithania\".\nThe Czech hopes were revived again in 1870\u20131871. In an Imperial Rescript of 26 September 1870, Franz Joseph referred again to the prestige and glory of the Bohemian Crown and to his intention to hold a coronation. Under Minister-President Karl Hohenwart in 1871, the government of Cisleithania negotiated a series of fundamental articles spelling out the relationship of the Bohemian Crown to the rest of the Habsburg Monarchy. On 12 September 1871, Franz Joseph announced:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Having in mind the constitutional position of the Bohemian Crown and being conscious of the glory and power which that Crown has given us \"and our predecessors\"\u2026 we gladly recognise the rights of the kingdom and are prepared to renew that recognition through our coronation oath.\nFor the planned coronation, the composer Bed\u0159ich Smetana had written the opera \"Libu\u0161e\", but the ceremony did not take place. The creation of the German Empire, domestic opposition from German-speaking liberals (especially German-Bohemians) and from Hungarians doomed the Fundamental Articles. Hohenwart resigned and nothing changed.\nMany Czech people were waiting for political changes in monarchy, including Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk and others. Masaryk served in the \"Reichsrat\" (Upper House) from 1891 to 1893 in the Young Czech Party and again from 1907 to 1914 in the Realist Party (which he had founded in 1900), but he did not campaign for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. In Vienna in 1909 he helped Hinko Hinkovi\u0107's defense in the fabricated trial against prominent Croats and Serbs members of the Serbo-Croatian Coalition (such as Frano Supilo and Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107), and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years and a number of death penalties. The Bohemian question would remain unresolved for the entirety of Franz Joseph's reign.\nForeign policy.\nGerman question.\nThe main foreign policy goal of Franz Joseph had been the unification of Germany under the House of Habsburg. This was justified on grounds of precedence; from 1452 to the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, with only one brief period of interruption under the House of Wittelsbach, the Habsburgs had generally held the German crown. However, Franz Joseph's desire to retain the non-German territories of the Habsburg Austrian Empire in the event of German unification proved problematic.\nTwo factions quickly developed: a party of German intellectuals favouring a Greater Germany (\"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\") under the House of Habsburg; the other favouring a Lesser Germany (\"Kleindeutschland\"). The Greater Germans favoured the inclusion of Austria in a new all-German state on the grounds that Austria had always been a part of Germanic empires, that it was the leading power of the German Confederation, and that it would be absurd to exclude eight million Austrian Germans from an all-German nation state. The champions of a lesser Germany argued against the inclusion of Austria on the grounds that it was a multi-nation state, not a German one, and that its inclusion would bring millions of non-Germans into the German nation state.\nIf Greater Germany were to prevail, the crown would necessarily have to go to Franz Joseph, who had no desire to cede it in the first place to anyone else. On the other hand, if the idea of a smaller Germany won out, the German crown could of course not possibly go to the Emperor of Austria, but would naturally be offered to the head of the largest and most powerful German state outside of Austria\u2014the King of Prussia. The contest between the two ideas, quickly developed into a contest between Austria and Prussia. After Prussia decisively won the Seven Weeks War, this question was solved; Austria lost no territories to Prussia as long as they remained out of German affairs.\nThree Emperors League.\nIn 1873, two years after the unification of Germany, Franz Joseph entered into the League of Three Emperors (\"Dreikaiserbund\") with Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany and Emperor Alexander II of Russia, who was succeeded by Tsar Alexander III in 1881. The league had been designed by the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, as an attempt to maintain the peace of Europe. It would last intermittently until 1887.\nVatican.\nIn 1903, Franz Joseph's veto of Jus exclusivae of Cardinal Mariano Rampolla's election to the papacy was transmitted to the Papal conclave by Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko. It was the last use of such a veto, as the new Pope Pius X prohibited future uses and provided for excommunication for any attempt.\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nDuring the mid-1870s, a series of violent rebellions against Ottoman rule broke out in the Balkans, and the Turks responded with equally violent and oppressive reprisals. Tsar Alexander II of Russia, wanting to intervene against the Ottomans, sought and obtained an agreement with Austria-Hungary.\nIn the Budapest Convention of 1877, the two powers agreed that Russia would annex southern Bessarabia, and Austria-Hungary would observe a benevolent neutrality toward Russia in the pending war with the Turks. As compensation for this support, Russia agreed to Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. A scant 15 months later, the Russians imposed on the Ottomans the Treaty of San Stefano, which reneged on the Budapest accord and declared that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be jointly occupied by Russian and Austrian troops.\nThe treaty was overturned by the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, which allowed sole Austrian occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina but did not specify a final disposition of the provinces. That omission was addressed in the Three Emperors' League agreement of 1881, when both Germany and Russia endorsed Austria-Hungary's right to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, by 1897, under a new tsar, the Russian Imperial government had again withdrawn its support for Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian foreign minister, Count Mikhail Muravyov, stated that an Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina would raise \"an extensive question requiring special scrutiny\".\nIn 1908, the Russian foreign minister, Alexander Izvolsky, offered Russian support, for the third time, for the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, in exchange for Austrian support for the opening of the Bosporus Strait and the Dardanelles to Russian warships. Austria's foreign minister, Alois von Aehrenthal, pursued this offer vigorously, resulting in the quid pro quo understanding with Izvolsky, reached on 16 September 1908 at the Buchlau Conference. However, Izvolsky made this agreement with Aehrenthal without the knowledge of Tsar Nicholas II or his government in St. Petersburg, or any of the other foreign powers including Britain, France and Serbia.\nBased upon the assurances of the Buchlau Conference and the treaties that preceded it, Franz Joseph signed the proclamation announcing the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina into the Empire on 6 October 1908. However a diplomatic crisis erupted, as both the Serbs and the Italians demanded compensation for the annexation, which the Austro-Hungarian government refused to entertain. The incident was not resolved until the revision of the Treaty of Berlin in April 1909, exacerbating tensions between Austria-Hungary and the Serbs.\nOutbreak of World War I.\nOn 28 June 1914, Franz Joseph's nephew and heir presumptive Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his morganatic wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were assassinated by Gavrilo Princip, a Yugoslav nationalist of Serbian ethnicity, during a visit to Sarajevo. Franz Joseph learned about the assassination of Franz Ferdinand from his adjutant, cavalry General Eduard von Paar, who also wrote the emperor's reaction in his diary: \"one has not to defy the Almighty. In this manner a superior power has restored that order which I unfortunately was unable to maintain.\"\nWhile the emperor was shaken, and interrupted his holiday to return to Vienna, he soon resumed his vacation at his Kaiservilla at Bad Ischl. Initial decision-making during the \"July Crisis\" fell to Count Leopold Berchtold, the Imperial foreign minister; Count Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, the chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff and the other ministers. The ultimate resolution of deliberations by the Austro-Hungarian government during the weeks following the assassination of the Archduke was to give Serbia an ultimatum of itemized demands that would reveal the conspirators in assassination of the archduke. However Serbia,despite no involvement in the plot,attempted to cover up the conspirators by either saying one of the conspirators never existed or being vague with the details. For Austria hungary,it was a matter of security as the Black hand had been terrorising bosnia for years and had even attempted to assassinate governor of Bosnia in 1910. The empire had no choice but war to save its prestige,even though Franz joseph was hesitant and now with archduke franz Ferdinand no longer vetoing the Austrian general staff's demands against war,Hotzendorf,always the advocate for war against serbia to destroy black hand as the organisation was based in Serbia,got his way.\nA week after delivery of the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia; on 28 July, war was declared. Within weeks, the Germans, Russians, French and British had all entered the fray which eventually became known as World War I. On 6 August, Franz Joseph signed the declaration of war against Russia.\nDeath.\nFranz Joseph died in the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace on the evening of 21 November 1916, at the age of 86. His final words to his valet were: \u2018Tomorrow morning, at half past three.\u2019 Although sick, he was determined to rise at his usual time. \nHis death was a result of developing pneumonia of the right lung several days after catching a cold while walking in Sch\u00f6nbrunn Park with King Ludwig III of Bavaria. He was succeeded by his grandnephew Charles I &amp; IV, who reigned until the collapse of the empire following its defeat at the end of the First World War in 1918. He is buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.\nFamily.\nIt was generally felt in the court that the emperor should marry and produce heirs as soon as possible. Various potential brides were considered, including Princess Elisabeth of Modena, Princess Anna of Prussia and Princess Sidonia of Saxony. Although in public life Franz Joseph was the unquestioned director of affairs, in his private life his mother still wielded crucial influence. Sophie wanted to strengthen the relationship between the Houses of Habsburg and Wittelsbach\u2014descending from the latter house herself\u2014and hoped to match Franz Joseph with her sister Ludovika's eldest daughter, Helene (\"N\u00e9n\u00e9\"), who was four years the emperor's junior.\nHowever, Franz Joseph fell deeply in love with N\u00e9n\u00e9's younger sister Elisabeth (\"Sisi\"), a beautiful girl of 15, and insisted on marrying her instead. Sophie acquiesced, despite her misgivings about Sisi's appropriateness as an imperial consort, and the young couple were married on 24 April 1854 in St. Augustine's Church, Vienna.\nTheir marriage would eventually prove to be an unhappy one; though Franz Joseph was passionately in love with his wife, the feeling was not mutual. Elisabeth never truly acclimatized to life at court, and was frequently in conflict with the imperial family. Their first daughter Sophie died as an infant, and their only son Rudolf died by suicide in 1889 in the infamous Mayerling Incident.\nIn 1885, Franz Joseph met Katharina Schratt, a leading actress of the Vienna stage, and she became his friend and confidante. This relationship lasted the rest of his life, and was\u2014to a certain degree\u2014tolerated by Elisabeth. Franz Joseph built Villa Schratt in Bad Ischl for her, and also provided her with a small palace in Vienna. Though their relationship lasted for 34 years, it remained platonic.\nThe empress was an inveterate traveller, horsewoman, and fashion maven who was rarely seen in Vienna. Sisi was obsessed about preserving her beauty, carrying out many bizarre routines and strenuous exercise, and as a result suffered from ill health. She was stabbed to death by an Italian anarchist in 1898 while on a visit to Geneva. A few days after the funeral, Robert of Parma wrote in a letter to his friend Tirso de Olaz\u00e1bal that \"It was pitiful to look at the Emperor, he showed a great deal of energy in his immense pain, but at times one could see all the immensity of his grief.\" Franz Joseph never fully recovered from the loss. According to the future empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma he told his relatives: \"You'll never know how important she was to me\" or, according to some sources, \"You will never know how much I loved this woman.\"\nRelationship with Franz Ferdinand.\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand became heir presumptive (\"Thronfolger\") to the throne of Austria-Hungary in 1896 after the deaths of his cousin Rudolf (in 1889) and his father Karl Ludwig (in 1896). The relationship between him and Franz Joseph had always been a fairly contentious one, which was further exacerbated when Franz Ferdinand announced his desire to marry Countess Sophie Chotek. The emperor would not even consider giving his blessing to the union, as Sophie was merely of noble rank, not dynastic rank.\nAlthough the emperor received letters from members of the imperial family throughout the fall and winter of 1899 beseeching him to relent, Franz Joseph stood his ground. He finally gave his consent in 1900. However, the marriage was to be morganatic, and any children of the marriage would be ineligible to succeed to the throne. The couple were married on 1 July 1900 at Reichstadt. The emperor did not attend the wedding, nor did any of the archdukes. After that, the two men disliked and mistrusted each other.\nHis interactions with Franz Ferdinand were strained; the emperor's personal attendant recollected in his memoirs that:&lt;br&gt; \"thunder and lightning always raged when they had their discussions.\" \nFollowing the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and Sophie in 1914, Franz Joseph's daughter, Marie Valerie, noted that her father expressed his greater confidence in the new heir presumptive, his grandnephew Archduke Charles. The emperor admitted to his daughter, regarding the assassination: &lt;br&gt;\"For me, it is a relief from a great worry.\"\nTitles, styles, honours and arms.\nName.\nFranz Joseph's names in the languages of his empire included:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTitles and styles.\nThe full titulature of Francis Joseph after he succeeded his uncle Ferdinand I to the thrones of Empire of Austria and the vast realms of Central and Eastern Europe went as following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"His Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty, Francis Joseph I, by the Grace of God Emperor of Austria, King of Germany, King of Hungary, Bohemia, Lombardy\u2013Venetia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia, Lodomeria, Illyria, Serbia, Cumania, Bulgaria, Italy, Rama, Romania, King of Jerusalem, etc. etc.; Archduke of Austria; Grand Duke of Tuscany; Duke of Lorraine, Salzburg, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola and Bukovina; Grand Prince of Transylvania, Margrave of Moravia; Duke of Upper and Lower Silesia, of Modena, Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, of Auschwitz and Zator, of Teschen, Friaul, Ragusa and Zara and Teck; Princely Count of Habsburg and Tyrol, of Kyburg, Gorizia and Gradisca; Prince of Trento and Brixen; Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia, Istria; Count of Hohenems, Feldkirch, Bregenz, Sonnenberg, etc. etc.; Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro and on the Windic March; Grand Voivode of the Voivodeship of Serbia,\netc. etc.\"\nHonours.\nNational decorations.\nIn addition, he founded the Order of Franz Joseph (\"Franz Joseph-Orden\") on 2 December 1849, and the Order of Elizabeth (\"Elizabeth-Orden\") in 1898.\nLegacy.\nFranz Josef Land in the Russian Arctic was named in his honour in 1873 by the Austro-Hungarian North Pole expedition which first reported finding it. The Franz Josef Glacier in New Zealand's South Island also bears his name.\nFranz Joseph founded in 1872 the \"Franz Joseph University\" (Hungarian: \"Ferenc J\u00f3zsef Tudom\u00e1nyegyetem\", Romanian: \"Universitatea Francisc Iosif\") in the city of Cluj-Napoca (at that time a part of Austria-Hungary under the name of Kolozsv\u00e1r). The university was moved to Szeged after Cluj became a part of Romania, becoming the University of Szeged.\nIn certain areas, celebrations are still being held in remembrance of Franz Joseph's birthday. The Mitteleuropean People's Festival takes place every year around 18 August, and is a \"spontaneous, traditional and brotherly meeting among peoples of the Central-European Countries\". The event includes ceremonies, meetings, music, songs, dances, wine and food tasting, and traditional costumes and folklore from \"Mitteleuropa\".\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At club level, he played football in both France and England with Toulouse, Marseille, Monaco, Manchester United and Nantes. At international level, he played for the France national team, with whom he won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, representing his nation at a total of three editions of both the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship; he also reached the final of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, after which he retired from international football.\nNicknamed \"Le Divin Chauve\" (\"The Divine Bald One\"), due to his trademark shaved head, Barthez was France's most capped player in the FIFA World Cup, with 17 appearances at the finals and shares the record for the most World Cup clean sheets with Peter Shilton, with ten. In club football, he won the UEFA Champions League with Olympique Marseille in 1993 as well as several Ligue 1 and Premier League titles. After retiring from football in 2007, Barthez began a career in motorsport in 2008.\nEarly life.\nBarthez was born in Lavelanet, Ari\u00e8ge.\nClub career.\nMarseille.\nBarthez made his first division debut for Toulouse on 21 September 1991, against Nancy. He joined Marseille in 1992, and won both the French championship and the Champions League at the end of his first season in Marseille, keeping a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over Milan in final of the latter competition. The 1993 victory made him the youngest goalkeeper to win a Champions League title until Iker Casillas did so in 2000.\nMarseille, however, would be stripped of their domestic title, though not of the Champions League crown, due to their involvement in a domestic match fixing scandal, and a year later (1994) would suffer a forced relegation to the second division due to a related financial bankruptcy. He stayed with the club in Division 2 for the 1994\u201395 season, despite many offers from elite French clubs, helping Marseille to the title. This, however, did not earn them a promotion back to Ligue 1 due to their punishment (they were promoted the following season, after finishing second in division 2).\nMonaco.\nIn 1995, Barthez joined Monaco and won Ligue 1 titles in 1997 and 2000. He also played in Jean Tigana's talented Monaco side, which famously put his future club Manchester United out of the Champions League in 1998 on away goals after a 1\u20131 draw at Old Trafford.\nManchester United.\nAs a result of Barthez's success in the World Cup and the Euros, he caught the attention of Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who was searching for a star goalkeeper to replace the recently departed Peter Schmeichel, as Ferguson did not think that the previous season's goalkeeper, Mark Bosnich, was a long-term replacement. Barthez joined United for \u00a37.8\u00a0million in 2000. He was later reunited with national teammate Laurent Blanc, who joined United in 2001. The Barthez\u2013Blanc head-kissing ritual was performed at the start of Champions League matches.\nWell known for being eccentric, Barthez started out well for Manchester United. His first season was a triumph as he answered all the questions about how he would handle rainy Manchester compared to sunny Monaco. Barthez performed brilliantly throughout the season and became a crowd favourite. The fans loved his eccentric behaviour, his taunting dribbles and step-overs past opposing strikers, and most importantly, his remarkable reaction saves. Very often, it was critical saves that kept United from defeat or dropping valuable points, helping United to the 2000\u201301 FA Premier League title, their third in a row.\nA memorable incident happened when Manchester United faced Leeds United in March 2001. After dropping a cross from Robbie Keane, Barthez deliberately kicked out with his foot at Ian Harte, who fell to the ground on the edge of six yard box, and the referee awarded a penalty to Leeds. Harte stepped up but Barthez made a low, one-handed save to his right. The only blemish in his first season was his failed attempt at \"psyching out\" West Ham United's Paolo Di Canio in the FA Cup Fourth Round; Di Canio beat the offside trap, while Barthez stood still with his hand up expecting the referee to blow his whistle, or Di Canio to stop. Di Canio continued and scored the only goal of the game, and later said it was \"better to score and then see whether the goalkeeper is right or wrong\".\nThe 2001\u201302 season was split into two parts for him. The first half was tumultuous. The Frenchman seemed to be taking some unnecessary risks outside his penalty area, and his antics began to have consequences that allowed unneeded goals for opposing teams. He was at fault for two goals in a 3\u20132 home defeat by Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a in October 2001. Ferguson said how \"eventually he will get caught out\" and it wouldn't happen again. But another couple of late errors against Arsenal in a 3\u20131 defeat at Highbury the following month put much pressure on Barthez, with two goals gifted to Thierry Henry, one of which came from a mis-hit clearance. Barthez was at the centre of further controversy when, after already being on a yellow card following an argument with Matthew Upson, he was caught by television cameras raising his middle fingers behind his back towards the Arsenal supporters, who had been taunting him for his errors towards the end of the match; the incident was missed by the referee Peter Jones, however. There was much speculation as to what was the source of Barthez's decline, and critics such as the BBC's Phil McNulty urged him to be dropped. Sir Alex Ferguson, however, had faith in his goalkeeper, and stuck by him. Consequently, in the second half of the season, Barthez repaired his reputation with consistent, solid performances and the spectacular saves that he was famous for. His turn in fortunes was shown in a 2\u20132 draw with Derby County at Pride Park. Derby forward Malcolm Christie looked to have sealed his hat-trick, but referee Steve Dunn controversially disallowed the goal, ruling that Christie kicked the ball out of Barthez's hands.\nHe was also noted for playing mind games before opposition players took a penalty. The first time this occurred was in November 2001 when Leicester City came to Old Trafford. As Muzzy Izzet prepared to take a penalty, Barthez stood aside from the goal, with his hands behind him on the post. Izzet, tired of waiting, slotted the ball in the bottom corner, but referee Andy D'Urso made him retake the penalty, this time with Barthez in goal. Izzet went the same way, but Barthez denied him with a fine save to his right. An almost identical incident happened less than a year later in October 2002, when Barthez was unhappy about the awarding of a penalty to Fulham, and so went from post to post banging his boots, and refused to be in goal for the penalty. This time he was booked for his antics by referee Mike Dean, and so he then took his place between the posts and made it work again by saving Steed Malbranque's spot kick.\nThe 2002\u201303 season ended with another Premier League crown for United. The season was a mixed bag for Barthez. One highlight was a fabulous save to deny Dietmar Hamann's 30-yard rocket at Anfield against Liverpool, as United held on to win 2\u20131. In other games, he let goals go past him that he would have been expected to save, and suffered from a run of poor form towards the end of the season. Barthez was also widely criticized in United's exit to Real Madrid in the Champions League, especially for Ronaldo's opener which beat him at the near post. It would prove to be his last ever game with United as Sir Alex Ferguson's patience had finally run out. Barthez was dropped for the final three games of the season, with Roy Carroll taking his place.\nReturn to Marseille.\nBarthez's poor form at the end of the previous season and the arrival of American newcomer Tim Howard in summer of 2003, saw the Frenchman face competition for a starting spot at United. As Barthez had only returned from international duty in August, Howard played during the club's American tour of the summer, and his performances led Ferguson to choose him to start over Barthez in the Community Shield in August. \nBy October, Howard had won the starting goalkeeper's job from Barthez; as a result, United agreed to release Barthez from his contract at Old Trafford after the 2003\u201304 season, and also agreed to loan Barthez out to his former club Marseille for the remainder of that season. Barthez began training with Marseille, who took on a portion of his wages, but FIFA initially blocked the loan deal on the grounds that it was not agreed upon within the international transfer window. The two clubs agreed on a loan deal after the transfer window reopened on 1 January 2004, and Barthez joined Marseille soon afterwards. On 27 April, Marseille and Barthez agreed to a two-and-a-half-year contract which would keep him at the club until spring 2006.\nBarthez was involved in a controversy during a friendly match between Marseille and Morocco's Wydad Casablanca on 12 February 2005. With ten minutes left, a Marseille player was sent off and a brawl erupted between players on the pitch. Barthez was reported for spitting on the Moroccan referee. On 21 April, Barthez was summoned to a hearing before the disciplinary committee of the French Football Federation (FFF); the following day, he received a six-month suspension, with the last three months being suspended. In an unusual move, the federal council of the FFF appealed the suspension, arguing that the punishment should have been for a minimum of six full months. Eventually, his suspension was extended to six full months due to political pressures.\nRetirement.\nOn 8 August 2006, Barthez announced he was still hoping to play professional football for another two years, insisting he was also looking to continue his career in the French international setup. His ideal scenario would have been a return to first club Toulouse, where he could be close enough to allow him to take care of his sick mother. But he said if he did not have a club by 31 August he would not carry on with football. On 5 October 2006, it was confirmed that he had retired from football, having failed to agree a return to Toulouse. Barthez commented: \"The only club I wanted to go to was not so happy to have me. It happens and you have to live with it.\"\nComeback.\nOn 17 December 2006, Barthez announced his return to football by signing a contract with Ligue 1 side Nantes, who were lacking an experienced goalkeeper following Micka\u00ebl Landreau's move to Paris Saint-Germain the previous summer. Serbian goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovi\u0107, originally recruited to replace Landreau, failed to impress and left Nantes at the winter break following a rift within the squad.\nOn 29 April, Nantes chairman Rudi Roussillon announced that following an altercation with a Nantes fan, Barthez had left the city with his family. The next day, Barthez confirmed that he had quit the team, and the club terminated his contract. Barthez denied that he was planning to retire, and in an article for French daily \"L'\u00c9quipe\", he said that he was looking for another contract for at least two years. Barthez was linked with numerous clubs, but nothing ever materialised and he had to face never playing professional football again.\nLuzenac.\nIn 2012, Barthez became the honorary president of Championnat National team Luzenac, where he personally picked Quentin Westberg and Nicolas Dieuze to sign for the club.\nInternational career.\nEarly international career.\nOn 26 May 1994, Barthez won his first cap for France in a 1\u20130 victory against Australia. Barthez was understudy to Bernard Lama at UEFA Euro 1996 \u2013 at which France reached the semi-finals \u2013 after testing positive for cannabis earlier that year; he was suspended for two months as a result. Following a later suspension to Lama instead, however, Barthez subsequently gained the number one goalkeeping position shortly after the tournament and would not relinquish it for a decade.\n1998 World Cup.\nIn the 1998 FIFA World Cup, which was hosted by his home country, Barthez conceded only two goals in seven games and won the Yashin Award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament, also placing second in the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper award that year, behind Jos\u00e9 Luis Chilavert. Barthez was also well known during the tournament for letting teammate and good friend Laurent Blanc kiss his shaved head before the start of every match, supposedly for good luck. Barthez was an integral part of his national team's inaugural triumph which also made it the first time in 20 years that a host had won the World Cup. He kept five clean sheets throughout the tournament, with the only goals he conceded being a penalty in the group stage against Denmark, and another goal against Croatia in the semi-final. In the quarter-final shootout defeat of rivals Italy, he kept a clean sheet, and also saved Demetrio Albertini's penalty kick. He kept another clean sheet in the final, which ended in a 3\u20130 win over defending champions Brazil. During the game, Barthez was also at the centre of a notable controversial incident when he made a spectacular save while rushing out and attempting to anticipate Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, doing his trademark leap/step-over the attacking striker to grab the ball, which injured Ronaldo in the process; Barthez later commented that he never intended to hurt the striker. Following France's World Cup victory, Barthez was one of the most popular national players in France, after Zinedine Zidane.\nEuro 2000.\nTwo years later, Barthez was again the starter as his country won Euro 2000. It was the first time in 26 years that a national team held both the World Cup and Euro titles, a feat last accomplished by West Germany in 1974. After that triumph, France held the top position in the FIFA World Rankings system from 2001 to 2002.\n2002 World Cup and Euro 2004.\nBarthez played on France's World Cup team again in 2002 in which they exited in the first round without winning a game or scoring a goal; he kept his only clean sheet of the tournament in his nation's second group match, a 0\u20130 draw against Uruguay. He was also his nation's starting keeper throughout their victorious Confederations Cup campaign in 2003, and at Euro 2004; in the latter tournament, he saved David Beckham's penalty shot in the opening round robin match, but France went out in the quarter-finals to eventual winners Greece.\n2006 World Cup.\nHis place as starting goalkeeper in France's 2006 World Cup campaign, in the face of a substantial public campaign in support of Gr\u00e9gory Coupet, was surprising to many, even more so given Coupet's flawless performance in the remainder of the World Cup qualifying campaign after Barthez's suspension. The decision was met with derision in the French press and also led to Coupet's walking out of the national squad before the tournament, though he was to return one day later. The move was viewed by some as a desire to keep the veterans of France's 1998 World Cup victory on the team. \"L'Equipe\" reported after the World Cup that Barthez would have walked out of the squad had he not been named the starter.\nFrance had a slow start in the group stage, drawing their first two games and putting their chances of reaching the knock-out stages at risk. Fortunately, Barthez's team found their form and won their final round robin match 2\u20130 to advance to the next stage, where they upset heavily favoured Spain 3\u20131 in the round of 16.\nIn defeating Brazil, 1\u20130 on 1 July 2006, Barthez, having made only one save in the game (on an injury time shot from Ronaldo), became the first keeper to blank the Brazilian team in consecutive World Cup finals matches, the first being the 1998 final (3\u20130). France is now one of only four nations (along with Italy, Argentina and the Netherlands) to have shut Brazil out twice in the World Cup finals, and the first to have done it in consecutive matches, both times with Barthez in goal.\nBarthez again kept another clean sheet \u2013 his fourth of the tournament \u2013 in the semi-final against Portugal (with Zinedine Zidane's penalty shot the winning goal), though he appeared in questionable form. A few minutes from time, he spectacularly spilled a free-kick which Lu\u00eds Figo recovered, heading over the bar although unchallenged. He did, however, redeem himself in injury time when a French defender fumbled the ball, enabling a Portuguese player to mount a last-moment attack. Barthez scrambled out of the net and blocked the first shot.\nDuring the final against Italy, he briefly captained his team for the remainder of the second period of extra time after Zidane was sent off. During the penalty shootout, neither he nor his Italian counterpart Gianluigi Buffon made a save, and France striker David Trezeguet's missed shot ultimately proved decisive. This proved to be Barthez's 87th and final international appearance, as he retired from international football following the tournament.\nMotorsport career.\nAfter retiring from football in 2007, Barthez began a career in motorsport in 2008. He began competing at selected events in the Porsche Carrera Cup France that year with the team SOFREV Auto Sport Promotion. He also competed at two events in the THP Spider Cup. In 2009, he raced in a number of various motorsport series such as the French GT Championship, Bioracing Series and the Caterham Sigma Cup France as well as the Porsche Carrera Cup France. He continued to race in the FFSA GT Championship in 2010 and picked up his first podium in race 1 at Dijon-Prenois. In the 2012 season, he won his first race in the FFSA series at the Circuito de Navarra in race two and finished seventh in the championship. In 2013, he was crowned French GT Champion alongside Morgan Moullin-Traffort, driving a Ferrari.\nIn 2013, he also competed in the newly re-branded FIA GT Series alongside G\u00e9rard Tonelli in the Gentleman Trophy class with SOFREV ASP, driving a GT3-spec Ferrari 458 Italia.\nIn February 2014, it was announced that Barthez would enter the 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans race, driving Sofrev ASP's Ferrari 458. Barthez and his co-drivers finished 29th overall and ninth in the LMGTE Am class.\nCoaching career.\nOn 2 July 2010, after Laurent Blanc's appointment as the new manager of the France national team, Barthez was named among the team's technical staff as a goalkeeping coach.\nStyle of play.\nRated by pundits as one of the greatest goalkeepers of his generation, in his prime, Barthez was considered to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world, and is regarded as one of the best French players ever in his position, being named the fourth greatest French goalkeeper of all time in IFFHS' Century elections, behind Bernard Lama, Pierre Chayrigu\u00e8s and Julien Darui. Standing at , according to some sources , he was not particularly tall for a goalkeeper, although he was extremely athletic, and was known for his elevation, as well as his decision-making, bravery, ability to read the game and commitment when coming out to collect the ball, which made him effective in the air and enabled him to command his area effectively in spite of his short stature; however, at times, he was still caught out on high balls due to his lack of height and poor handling, and he also came under criticism on occasion for his indecisiveness when struggling to deal with crosses. A flamboyant and instinctive keeper, he was also extremely agile and possessed excellent reflexes, which enabled him to produce spectacular, acrobatic and decisive reaction saves; he also possessed a good positional sense.\nIn addition to his shot-stopping abilities, Barthez was also known to be a passionate, popular, and highly recognisable footballing figure, who stood out for his outgoing personality, self-assurance, and composure under pressure, as well as his leadership from the back and authoritative presence in goal. Furthermore, Barthez was highly regarded for his exceptional skills with the ball at his feet, as well as his accurate distribution with his left foot, which enabled him to play the ball out from the back or launch an attack with his quick throws or long goal kicks; his confidence in possession often led him to be involved in the build-up of plays, and he often operated outside the penalty area, and would even occasionally attempt to dribble with the ball past opposing strikers with feints such as nutmegs or stepovers. He was also very quick off his line, and often acted as a sweeper-keeper, thus contributing to the evolution of the role. While he received plaudits for his goalkeeping ability in the media, throughout his career Barthez also frequently came under criticism from pundits for his stubbornness, and his aggressive, unorthodox and eccentric style of play, as well as for taking unnecessary risks; he was also deemed to be inconsistent, unreliable and prone to errors and lapses in concentration.\nPersonal life.\nThrough his career, Barthez was known for his active romantic life, and dated Canadian model Linda Evangelista. She became pregnant but miscarried, six months into the pregnancy. The couple broke up in 2000, reunited in 2001, and then officially ended their relationship in 2002. Barthez is a smoker. Known for his eccentric and superstitious personality, Barthez often wore red briefs underneath his goalkeeping shorts, and usually cut off the sleeves of his goalkeeping jersey. Although most starting goalkeepers are usually assigned the number 1 shirt, he instead chose to wear the number 16 shirt. He is a practicing Zen Buddhist.\nEndorsements.\nDuring his playing career, Barthez signed advertising deals with McDonald's and Adidas.\nCareer statistics.\nClub.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHonours.\nMarseille\nMonaco\nManchester United\nFrance\nIndividual\nOrders\nRecords\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "51697", "revid": "50625954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51697", "title": "Deposition (law)", "text": "Out-of-court oral testimony of a witness, reduced to writing\nA deposition in the law of the United States, or examination for discovery in the law of Canada, is the taking of sworn, out-of-court oral testimony of a witness that may be reduced to a written transcript for later use in court or for discovery purposes. Depositions are commonly used in litigation in the United States and Canada. They are almost always conducted outside court by the lawyers themselves, with no judge present to supervise the examination.\nHistory.\nDepositions by written interrogatories first appeared around the mid-15th century as a procedure for discovery, factfinding, and evidence preservation in suits in equity in English courts. They differed radically from modern depositions in three ways: (1) the party seeking a witness's testimony merely propounded written interrogatories which were read out loud by a master or court-appointed commissioner to the witness in a closed proceeding without parties or counsel present; (2) the witness's first-person oral answers under oath were not recorded verbatim, but were summarized by the master, commissioner, or a clerk appointed by them into a third-person continuous narrative; and (3) the resulting written product (also called a \"deposition\") was filed with the court under seal and its contents were not revealed or \"published\" to the parties until shortly before trial. \nThe modern deposition by oral examination began to develop in New York in the early 19th century when Chancellor James Kent of the New York Court of Chancery allowed masters to actually examine witnesses (that is, pursue lines of questions in real time based on the witness's preceding answers) rather than read static interrogatories (which tended to be broadly worded and resulted in very inefficient depositions). He also allowed parties and counsel to be present during depositions. This meant depositions were no longer secret and led to counsel insisting on taking over the examinations themselves. These developments gradually spread across the United States and Canada.\nDuring the late 19th century, summary narratives by court-appointed examiners were replaced by verbatim transcripts by court reporters. Finally, the merger of common law and equity procedure led to the adoption of live testimony in open court as the default method of taking trial evidence in all trials (equity had used depositions by written interrogatories in lieu of live testimony), which reduced the deposition to its modern role in American civil procedure as a discovery and evidence preservation device.\nBy country.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, the process is nearly identical to that followed in the United States, but the proceeding is called an examination for discovery (). Typically, the questions for the witness will be a mixture of direct questions and cross-examinations on prior statements. While most of the same objections to form are applicable as in the United States, the witness's lawyer may additionally take certain questions \"under advisement\" as a means of delaying answering the question, without making a formal objection.\nThe process is considered in Canada to be time-consuming and expensive when conducted without limits. As a result, Rule 31.05.1 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure has, since January 1, 2010, limited examinations for discovery to seven hours per party except with consent of the other parties or the leave of the court. British Columbia implemented similar reforms on July 1, 2010, although the new Rule 7-2(2) can be read in two ways, it appears to be that each party can examine each other party for a maximum of seven hours unless the court orders otherwise. The alternative reading is that each party is only to be examined for a maximum of seven hours.\nChina.\nIn mainland China, it is generally illegal to take depositions for use in foreign courts.\nUnited States.\n\"Deposition\" is the preferred term in U.S. federal courts and in the majority of U.S. states. In some unusual situations, depositions can be taken during or even after trial.\nCivil procedure.\nIn almost all cases pending in United States federal courts, depositions are carried out under Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. About 35 states use versions of the FRCP in their state courts. Other states have discovery rules that are set out either in court rules or statutes, and which vary somewhat from one state to another. According to FRCP Rule 30, the number of depositions is limited to ten depositions per side (i.e. plaintiffs and defendants), with deposition of each deponent limited to a single day of no more than seven hours (unless specified otherwise in local rules of the district).\nThe person to be \"deposed\" (questioned) at a deposition, known as the \"deponent\", is usually notified to appear at the appropriate time and place by means of a subpoena. Frequently, the most desired witness (the deponent) is an opposite party to the action. In that instance, legal notice may be given to that person's attorney, and a subpoena is not required. However, if the witness is not a party to the lawsuit (a third party) or is reluctant to testify, then a subpoena must be served on that party. To ensure an accurate record of statements made during a deposition, a court reporter is present and typically transcribes the deposition by digital recording or stenographic means. Depending upon the amount in controversy and the ability of the witness to appear at trial, audio or video recordings of the deposition are sometimes taken as well.\nConduct of depositions.\nDepositions usually take place at the office of the court reporter or in the office of one of the law firms involved in a case. However, depositions are also sometimes taken at a witness's workplace or home, or in a nearby hotel's conference room. Generally, the deposition is attended by the person who is to be deposed, their attorney, court reporter, and other parties in the case who can appear personally or be represented by their counsels. Any party to the action and their attorneys have the right to be present and to ask questions.\nPrior to taking a deposition, the court reporter administers the same oath or affirmation that the deponent would take if the testimony were being given in court in front of a judge and jury. Thereafter, the court reporter makes a verbatim digital or stenographic record of all that is said during the deposition, in the same manner that witness testimony is recorded in court. Some jurisdictions allow stenomask technology in lieu of traditional stenographic equipment, although many jurisdictions still prohibit stenomask because of its disconcerting effect on some lawyers and witnesses.\nAttorneys for the deposing litigant are often present, although this is not required in all jurisdictions. The attorney who has ordered the deposition begins questioning of the deponent (this is referred to as \"direct examination\" or \"direct\" for short). Since nods and gestures cannot be recorded, the witness is instructed to answer all questions aloud. After the direct examination, other attorneys in attendance have an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. The first attorney may ask more questions at the end, in \"re-direct\", which may be followed by \"re-cross\".\nDuring the course of the deposition, one attorney or another may object to questions asked. In most jurisdictions, only two types of objections are allowed: The first is to assert a privilege and the second is to object to the form of the question asked. Objections to form are frequently used to signal the witness to be careful in answering the question. Since the judge is not present, all other objections, in particular those involving the rules of evidence, are generally preserved until trial. They still can be made sometime at the deposition to indicate the serious problem to judge and witness, but the witness must answer the question despite these objections. If the form objection is made, the opposite party still has the right to re-phrase the same question and ask it again. Indeed, in Texas, lawyers were so aggressively using objections to indirectly coach their witnesses on the record that all objections outside four narrow categories are now prohibited and making such prohibited objections waives \"all\" objections to the question or answer at issue. California is the major \"outlier\" on deposition objections; under the California Civil Discovery Act as enacted in 1957 and heavily revised in 1986, most objections must be given on the record at the deposition (and must be specific as to the objectionable nature of the question or response) or they are permanently waived.\nAs with oral examination at trial, depositions can become heated at times, with some attorneys asking harassing questions to provoke witnesses into losing their tempers, some witnesses giving evasive answers, and occasional use of profane language. In extreme situations, one side or the other may ask the reporter to mark the record, then may suspend the deposition, demand a rush transcript, and file an emergency motion to compel a response, for a protective order, or for sanctions. Some courts have magistrates or discovery commissioners who are on call for such contingencies, and the parties are supposed to use them to referee such disputes over the telephone or via email before resorting to filing motions. In extreme circumstances where the relationship between the lawyers, parties, or witnesses has totally broken down, the court may require the use of a discovery referee who will have authority to sit in on depositions and rule immediately on objections as they are presented, may order that all further depositions take place in court in the presence of a judge, or may grant terminating sanctions if the record is already clear as to which party or attorney is responsible for the breakdown in civility.\nParties can bring documents to the deposition and ask document identification questions to build a foundation for making the documents admissible as evidence at trial, as long as the deponent admits their authenticity. The court reporter and all parties in the case are usually provided a copy of the documents during the deposition for review.\nIn recent years, developments in litigation technology has allowed the use of paper documents to be replaced by electronic documents and exhibits in the deposition. In such cases, the examining attorney marks and distributes the official exhibits electronically using a laptop or tablet device. The deponent, court reporter, and all parties receive digital official exhibits or courtesy copies. Combined with live transcript feed technology and legal videography, digital exhibit technology has made participation in remote depositions more functional and popular.\nUnder FRCP 30(d)(1) and its state counterparts, a deposition normally must take place for no longer than seven hours on one day per each deponent, unless otherwise stipulated by the parties or ordered by the court. The deposing party who knows that a deposition will require more than seven hours on one day must either ask the deponent to stipulate to more time, or, if the deponent is uncooperative, promptly file a motion for a longer deposition. For many years, California was the major exception to this rule, in that its Civil Discovery Act had \"no\" default time limit; depositions could theoretically proceed indefinitely, or at least until the deposition became so obviously excessive and burdensome that the deponent was able to move for a protective order. However, in January 2013, the California legislature amended the Civil Discovery Act to fall in line with the federal rule, by requiring that depositions will typically be limited to seven hours of total testimony. This new rule does not apply to \"any case brought by an employee or applicant for employment against an employer for acts or omissions arising out of or relating to the employment relationship.\"\nAfter the deposition, the transcript is then published in the form of a hardcopy booklet, which is provided to the deponent as well as to any party to the suit who wishes to purchase a copy. The booklet will have the case caption (the name of the court, case number, and names of the parties) on the front. Inside, the pages have line numbers along the left margin, so that the parties can precisely cite testimony by page and line in later court documents. Timestamps are inserted into the margin if a video recording is being made; in the event the witness is unavailable for trial, the parties or the court will use the timestamps to identify admissible segments which a video editor will stitch together to present to the jury. A concordance is automatically generated by the stenographic system's software and included in the back of the booklet. Finally, the booklet includes the court reporter's certificate in which they formally certify the truth and accuracy of the transcript. (In some states, the court reporter is also a notary public.) Most court reporters can also provide a digital copy of the transcript in ASCII, RealLegal, and PDF formats.\nThe court reporter also keeps a copy of the documents provided to the deponent during the deposition for document identification questions, unless digital document and exhibit technology is employed, in which case the deponent and all parties receive the official exhibits in real time. The deponent normally has the right to read and sign the deposition transcript before it is filed with the court. The deponent cannot change his testimony as recorded by the court reporter in the deposition transcript, but under rule 30(e) the deponent can correct on an additional \"errata sheet\" any mistakes in the deposition transcript shortly after the transcript has been typed and bound.\nThe errata sheet allows the deponent to make any modifications that make \"changes in form or substance,\" giving the deponent the option to alter their record from the original transcript. Issues may arise where a party attempts to make substantive changes to testimony through errata sheets.\nUse of depositions.\nThe chief values of obtaining a deposition, as with any discovery proceeding, is to give all litigant parties in a contested case a fair preview of the evidence, and to provide support documents for further trials and dispositive motions. The process provides a \"level playing field\" of information among the litigants and avoids surprises at trial (traditionally regarded as an unfair tactic). Another benefit of taking depositions is to preserve a witness's recollection while it is still fresh, since the trial may still be months or years away. When a witness's testimony in open court is inconsistent with that given at deposition, a party can introduce the deposition to impeach (or contradict) the witness. In the event a witness is unavailable for trial (usually because they are deceased, seriously ill, or live hundreds of miles away), their deposition may be read or played before the jury and made part of the record in the case, with the same legal force as live testimony. In some states, stenographic, audio, or video records of depositions can be offered into evidence even if the witness is available. Deposition of the opposite party is often used to produce self-incriminating statements from the deponent, also document identification questions can make exhibits admissible for hearings and summary judgment motions.\nSometimes, after a number of witnesses have been deposed, the parties will have enough information that they can reasonably predict the outcome of a prospective trial, and may decide to arrive at a compromise settlement, thus avoiding trial and preventing additional costs of litigation. Accordingly, while most depositions are not videotaped, opposing counsel may use the opportunity to get an impression of the witness's affect and appearance, because these are telling factors as to how that person will present in front of a jury. Furthermore, deposition transcripts are frequently submitted in support of motions for summary judgment as evidence that there is no triable issue of fact. The moving party may use transcripts to argue that even if all the testimony given at deposition was given again at trial, no reasonable factfinder could find in the opponent's favor on a material issue of fact. The rationale is that generally, a witness must give consistent testimony on all material issues of fact both at deposition \"and\" at trial (unless there is a very good reason for changing one's answers), or else the inconsistencies can and will be used to impeach his credibility.\nCriminal procedure.\nIn some United States jurisdictions, depositions may be taken in criminal cases, for reasons that vary between jurisdictions. In federal criminal cases, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 15 governs the taking of depositions. Each state has its own laws which govern the taking of depositions.\nMost jurisdictions provide that depositions may be taken to perpetuate the testimony of a witness, that is, preserve their testimony for trial. If the person requested to testify (deponent) is a party to the lawsuit or someone who works for an involved party, notice of time and place of the examination before trial can be given to the other side's attorney, but if the witness is an independent third party, a subpoena must be served on this witness if they are recalcitrant. This occurs when a witness may not be able to testify at trial. The deposition of the witness is taken and, if the witness is unable to appear at trial, the deposition may be used to establish the witness' testimony in lieu of the witness actually testifying. Regarding depositions to preserve testimony, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution establishes a constitutional right of the defendant to be present during the deposition and to cross-examine the witness. The defendant may waive this right.\nSome jurisdictions provide that depositions may be taken for purposes of discovery. In these jurisdictions, the defendant does not have a constitutional right to be present, although such a right may be established by statute.\nSome jurisdictions require that because of the sensitive nature of taking a deposition of a minor, it must be videotaped.\nA defendant in a criminal case may not be deposed without their consent because of the Fifth Amendment right to not give testimony against oneself.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This allows for treating the potential infinities of infinitely increasing sequences and infinitely decreasing series as actual infinities. For example, the infinite sequence formula_4 of the natural numbers increases \"infinitively\" and has no upper bound in the real number system (a potential infinity); in the extended real number line, the sequence has formula_2 as its least upper bound and as its limit (an actual infinity). In calculus and mathematical analysis, the use of formula_2 and formula_3 as actual limits extends significantly the possible computations. It is the Dedekind\u2013MacNeille completion of the real numbers.\nThe extended real number system is denoted formula_8, formula_9, or formula_10. When the meaning is clear from context, the symbol formula_2 is often written simply as formula_12.\nThere is also a distinct projectively extended real line where formula_2 and formula_3 are not distinguished, i.e., there is a single actual infinity for both infinitely increasing sequences and infinitely decreasing sequences that is denoted as just formula_12 or as formula_16.\nMotivation.\nLimits.\nThe extended number line is often useful to describe the behavior of a function formula_17 when either the argument formula_18 or the function value formula_17 gets \"infinitely large\" in some sense. For example, consider the function formula_17 defined by\nformula_21.\nThe graph of this function has a horizontal asymptote at formula_22. Geometrically, when moving increasingly farther to the right along the formula_18-axis, the value of formula_24 approaches 0. This limiting behavior is similar to the limit of a function formula_25 in which the real number formula_18 approaches formula_27 except that there is no real number that formula_18 approaches when formula_18 increases infinitely. Adjoining the elements formula_2 and formula_3 to formula_1 enables a definition of \"limits at infinity\" which is very similar to the usual definition of limits, except that formula_33 is replaced by formula_34 (for formula_2) or formula_36 (for formula_3). This allows proving and writing\nformula_38\nMeasure and integration.\nIn measure theory, it is often useful to allow sets that have infinite measure and integrals whose value may be infinite.\nSuch measures arise naturally out of calculus. For example, in assigning a measure to formula_1 that agrees with the usual length of intervals, this measure must be larger than any finite real number. Also, when considering improper integrals, such as\nformula_40\nthe value \"infinity\" arises. Finally, it is often useful to consider the limit of a sequence of functions, such as\nformula_41.\nWithout allowing functions to take on infinite values, such essential results as the monotone convergence theorem and the dominated convergence theorem would not make sense.\nOrder and topological properties.\nThe extended real number system formula_8, defined as formula_9 or formula_10, can be turned into a totally ordered set by defining formula_45 for all formula_46. With this order topology, formula_8 has the desirable property of compactness: Every subset of formula_48 has a supremum and an infimum (the infimum of the empty set is formula_2, and its supremum is formula_3). Moreover, with this topology, formula_48 is homeomorphic to the unit interval formula_52. Thus the topology is metrizable, corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this interval. There is no metric, however, that is an extension of the ordinary metric on formula_1.\nIn this topology, a set formula_54 is a neighborhood of formula_2 if and only if it contains a set formula_56 for some real number formula_57. The notion of the neighborhood of formula_3 can be defined similarly. Using this characterization of extended-real neighborhoods, limits with formula_18 tending to formula_2 or formula_3, and limits \"equal\" to formula_2 and formula_3, reduce to the general topological definition of limits\u2014instead of having a special definition in the real number system.\nArithmetic operations.\nThe arithmetic operations of formula_1 can be partially extended to formula_48 as follows:\nformula_66\nFor exponentiation, see . Here, formula_67 means both formula_68 and formula_69, while formula_70 means both formula_71 and formula_72.\nThe expressions formula_73, formula_74, and formula_75 (called indeterminate forms) are usually left undefined. These rules are modeled on the laws for infinite limits. However, in the context of probability or measure theory, formula_76 is often defined as 0.\nWhen dealing with both positive and negative extended real numbers, the expression formula_77 is usually left undefined, because, although it is true that for every real nonzero sequence formula_17 that converges to 0, the reciprocal sequence formula_79 is eventually contained in every neighborhood of formula_80, it is \"not\" true that the sequence formula_79 must itself converge to either formula_3 or formula_83 Said another way, if a continuous function formula_17 achieves a zero at a certain value formula_27 then it need not be the case that formula_79 tends to either formula_3 or formula_12 in the limit as formula_18 tends to formula_90. This is the case for the limits of the identity function formula_91 when formula_18 tends to 0, and of formula_93 (for the latter function, neither formula_3 nor formula_12 is a limit of formula_96, even if only positive values of formula_18 are considered).\nHowever, in contexts where only non-negative values are considered, it is often convenient to define formula_98. For example, when working with power series, the radius of convergence of a power series with coefficients formula_99 is often defined as the reciprocal of the limit-supremum of the sequence formula_100. Thus, if one allows formula_77 to take the value formula_2, then one can use this formula regardless of whether the limit-supremum is 0 or not.\nAlgebraic properties.\nWith the arithmetic operations defined above, formula_48 is not even a semigroup, let alone a group, a ring or a field as in the case of formula_1. However, it has several convenient properties:\nIn general, all laws of arithmetic are valid in formula_48 as long as all occurring expressions are defined.\nMiscellaneous.\nSeveral functions can be continuously extended to formula_48 by taking limits. For instance, one may define the extremal points of the following functions as:\nformula_126,\nformula_127,\nformula_128,\nformula_129.\nSome singularities may additionally be removed. For example, the function formula_130 can be continuously extended to formula_48 (under \"some\" definitions of continuity), by setting the value to formula_2 for formula_133, and 0 for formula_134 and formula_135. On the other hand, the function formula_136 can\"not\" be continuously extended, because the function approaches formula_3 as formula_18 approaches 0 from below, and formula_2 as formula_18 approaches 0 from above, i.e., the function not converging to the same value as its independent variable approaching to the same domain element from both the positive and negative value sides.\nA similar but different real-line system, the projectively extended real line, does not distinguish between formula_2 and formula_3 (i.e. infinity is unsigned). As a result, a function may have limit formula_12 on the projectively extended real line, while in the extended real number system only the absolute value of the function has a limit, e.g. in the case of the function formula_136 at formula_133. On the other hand, on the projectively extended real line, formula_146 and formula_147 correspond to only a limit from the right and one from the left, respectively, with the full limit only existing when the two are equal. Thus, the functions formula_148 and formula_149 cannot be made continuous at formula_150 on the projectively extended real line.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In contrast to a scalar processor, which can execute at most one single instruction per clock cycle, a superscalar processor can execute or start executing more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions to different execution units on the processor. It therefore allows more throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time which can even be less than 1) than would otherwise be possible at a given clock rate. Each execution unit is not a separate processor (or a core if the processor is a multi-core processor), but an execution resource within a single CPU such as an arithmetic logic unit.\nWhile a superscalar CPU is typically also pipelined, superscalar and pipelining execution are considered different performance enhancement techniques. The former (superscalar) executes multiple instructions in parallel by using multiple execution units, whereas the latter (pipeline) executes multiple instructions in the same execution unit in parallel by dividing the execution unit into different phases. In the \"Simple superscalar pipeline\" figure, fetching two instructions at the same time is superscaling, and fetching the next two before the first pair has been written back is pipelining.\nThe superscalar technique is traditionally associated with several identifying characteristics (within a given CPU):\nHistory.\nSeymour Cray's CDC 6600 from 1964, while not capable of issuing multiple instructions per cycle, is often cited as an early influence to modern superscalar processors for its ability to execute instructions simultaneously through multiple functional units. The 1967 IBM System/360 Model 91, was another early influence that introduced out-of-order execution, pioneering use of Tomasulo's algorithm. The Intel i960CA (1989), the AMD 29000-series 29050 (1990), and the Motorola MC88110 (1991), microprocessors were the first commercial single-chip superscalar microprocessors. RISC microprocessors like these were the first to have superscalar execution, because RISC architectures free transistors and die area which can be used to include multiple execution units and the traditional uniformity of the instruction set favors superscalar dispatch (this was why RISC designs were faster than CISC designs through the 1980s and into the 1990s, and it's far more complicated to do multiple dispatch when instructions have variable bit length).\nExcept for CPUs used in low-power applications, embedded systems, and battery-powered devices, essentially all general-purpose CPUs developed since about 1998 are superscalar.\nThe P5 Pentium was the first superscalar x86 processor; the Nx586, P6 Pentium Pro and AMD K5 were among the first designs which decode x86-instructions asynchronously into dynamic microcode-like \"micro-op\" sequences prior to actual execution on a superscalar microarchitecture; this opened up for dynamic scheduling of buffered \"partial\" instructions and enabled more parallelism to be extracted compared to the more rigid methods used in the simpler P5 Pentium; it also simplified speculative execution and allowed higher clock frequencies compared to designs such as the advanced Cyrix 6x86.\nScalar to superscalar.\nThe simplest processors are scalar processors. Each instruction executed by a scalar processor typically manipulates one or two data items at a time. By contrast, each instruction executed by a vector processor operates simultaneously on many data items. An analogy is the difference between scalar and vector arithmetic. A superscalar processor is a mixture of the two. Each instruction processes one data item, but there are multiple execution units within each CPU thus multiple instructions can be processing separate data items concurrently.\nSuperscalar CPU design emphasizes improving the instruction dispatcher accuracy and allowing it to keep the multiple execution units in use at all times. This has become increasingly important as the number of units has increased. While early superscalar CPUs would have two ALUs and a single FPU, a later design such as the PowerPC 970 includes four ALUs, two FPUs, and two SIMD units. If the dispatcher is ineffective at keeping all of these units fed with instructions, the performance of the system will be no better than that of a simpler, cheaper design.\nA superscalar processor usually sustains an execution rate in excess of one instruction per machine cycle. But merely processing multiple instructions concurrently does not make an architecture superscalar, since pipelined, multiprocessor or multi-core architectures also achieve that, but with different methods.\nIn a superscalar CPU the dispatcher reads instructions from memory and decides which ones can be run in parallel, dispatching each to one of the several execution units contained inside a single CPU. Therefore, a superscalar processor can be envisioned as having multiple parallel pipelines, each of which is processing instructions simultaneously from a single instruction thread.\nMost modern superscalar CPUs also have logic to reorder the instructions to try to avoid pipeline stalls and increase parallel execution.\nLimitations.\nAvailable performance improvement from superscalar techniques is limited by three key areas:\nExisting binary executable programs have varying degrees of intrinsic parallelism. In some cases instructions are not dependent on each other and can be executed simultaneously. In other cases they are inter-dependent: one instruction impacts either resources or results of the other. The instructions codice_1 can be run in parallel because none of the results depend on other calculations. However, the instructions codice_2 might not be runnable in parallel, depending on the order in which the instructions complete while they move through the units.\nAlthough the instruction stream may contain no inter-instruction dependencies, a superscalar CPU must nonetheless check for that possibility, since there is no assurance otherwise and failure to detect a dependency would produce incorrect results.\nNo matter how advanced the semiconductor process or how fast the switching speed, this places a practical limit on how many instructions can be simultaneously dispatched. While process advances will allow ever greater numbers of execution units (e.g. ALUs), the burden of checking instruction dependencies grows rapidly, as does the complexity of register renaming circuitry to mitigate some dependencies. Collectively the power consumption, complexity and gate delay costs limit the achievable superscalar speedup.\nHowever even given infinitely fast dependency checking logic on an otherwise conventional superscalar CPU, if the instruction stream itself has many dependencies, this would also limit the possible speedup. Thus the degree of intrinsic parallelism in the code stream forms a second limitation.\nAlternatives.\nCollectively, these limits drive investigation into alternative architectural changes such as very long instruction word (VLIW), explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC), simultaneous multithreading (SMT), and multi-core computing.\nWith VLIW, the burdensome task of dependency checking by hardware logic at run time is removed and delegated to the compiler. Explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC) is like VLIW with extra cache prefetching instructions.\nSimultaneous multithreading (SMT) is a technique for improving the overall efficiency of superscalar processors. SMT permits multiple independent threads of execution to better utilize the resources provided by modern processor architectures. The fact that they are independent means that we know that the instruction of one thread can be executed out of order and/or in parallel with the instruction of a different one. Also, one independent thread will not produce a pipeline bubble in the code stream of a different one, for example, due to a branch. \nSuperscalar processors differ from multi-core processors in that the several execution units are not entire processors. A single processor is composed of finer-grained execution units such as the ALU, integer multiplier, integer shifter, FPU, etc. There may be multiple versions of each execution unit to enable the execution of many instructions in parallel. This differs from a multi-core processor that concurrently processes instructions from \"multiple\" threads, one thread per processing unit (called \"core\"). It also differs from a pipelined processor, where the multiple instructions can concurrently be in various stages of execution, assembly-line fashion.\nThe various alternative techniques are not mutually exclusive\u2014they can be (and frequently are) combined in a single processor. Thus a multicore CPU is possible where each core is an independent processor containing multiple parallel pipelines, each pipeline being superscalar. Some processors also include vector capability.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "51706", "revid": "892079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51706", "title": "Very long instruction word", "text": "Computer architecture to aid parallelism\nVery Long Instruction Word (VLIW) is a type of instruction set architecture designed to exploit instruction-level parallelism (ILP) by explicitly specifying, in advance, which instructions execute in parallel. \nVLIW architectures contrast with superscalar architectures, the predominant approach for exploiting ILP, where hardware dynamically discovers and schedules parallel execution at runtime. VLIW's primary motivation is achieving higher performance without the hardware complexity of superscalar designs. The circuitry needed to repeatedly analyze instruction streams and schedule parallel execution at runtime increases chip area, cost, and power consumption while potentially reducing clock speeds.\nThe name VLIW derives from the instruction format found in almost all implementations, where the compiler bundles operations intended to execute simultaneously into a single, wide instruction word dispatched to execution units as one unit. These words can be extremely wide\u2014implementations have used instruction words of 1 kilobit or more. But this is only a side effect of the natural way to implement a VLIW. The distinguishing feature of a VLIW is that the exact execution order and parallelism are discovered and specified in advance.\nVLIW shifts the burden of identifying parallelism from hardware to the compiler. This increases compiler complexity substantially, as it must schedule instructions while ensuring correctness, resolving resource conflicts (for execution units, registers, and memory ports), and exploiting the greater parallelism that simpler VLIW hardware exposes.\nHistory.\nThe concept of VLIW architecture, and the term \"VLIW\", were invented by Josh Fisher in his research group at Yale University in the early 1980s. His original development of trace scheduling as a compiling method for VLIW was developed when he was a graduate student at New York University. Before VLIW, the notion of prescheduling execution units and instruction-level parallelism in software was well established in the practice of developing horizontal microcode. \nFisher's innovations involved developing a compiler that could target horizontal microcode from programs written in an ordinary programming language. He realized that to get good performance and target a wide-issue machine, it would be necessary to find parallelism beyond that generally within a basic block. He also developed region scheduling methods to identify parallelism beyond basic blocks. Trace scheduling is such a method, and involves scheduling the most likely path of basic blocks first, inserting compensating code to deal with speculative motions, scheduling the second most likely trace, and so on, until the schedule is complete.\nFisher's second innovation was the notion that the target CPU architecture should be designed to be a reasonable target for a compiler; that the compiler and the architecture for a VLIW processor must be codesigned. This was inspired partly by the difficulty Fisher observed at Yale of compiling for architectures like Floating Point Systems' FPS164, which had a complex instruction set computing (CISC) architecture that separated instruction initiation from the instructions that saved the result, needing very complex scheduling algorithms. Fisher developed a set of principles characterizing a proper VLIW design, such as self-draining pipelines, wide multi-port register files, and memory architectures. These principles made it easier for compilers to emit fast code.\nThe first VLIW compiler was described in a Ph.D. thesis by John Ellis, supervised by Fisher. The compiler was named Bulldog, after Yale's mascot.\nFisher left Yale in 1984 to found a startup company, Multiflow, along with cofounders John O'Donnell and John Ruttenberg. Multiflow produced the TRACE series of VLIW minisupercomputers, shipping their first machines in 1987. Multiflow's VLIW could issue 28 operations in parallel per instruction. The TRACE system was implemented in a mix of medium-scale integration (MSI), large-scale integration (LSI), and very large-scale integration (VLSI), packaged in cabinets, a technology obsoleted as it grew more cost-effective to integrate all of the components of a processor (excluding memory) on one chip.\nMultiflow was too early to catch the following wave, when chip architectures began to allow multiple-issue CPUs. The major semiconductor companies recognized the value of Multiflow technology in this context, so the compiler and architecture were subsequently licensed to most of these firms.\nMotivation.\nA processor that executes every instruction one after the other (i.e., a non-pipelined scalar architecture) may use processor resources inefficiently, yielding potential poor performance. The performance can be improved by executing different substeps of sequential instructions simultaneously (termed \"pipelining\"), or even executing multiple instructions entirely simultaneously as in superscalar architectures. Further improvement can be achieved by executing instructions in an order different from that in which they occur in a program, termed out-of-order execution.\nThese three methods all raise hardware complexity. Before executing any operations in parallel, the processor must verify that the instructions have no interdependencies. For example, if a first instruction's result is used as a second instruction's input, then they cannot execute at the same time and the second instruction cannot execute before the first. Modern out-of-order processors have increased the hardware resources which schedule instructions and determine interdependencies.\nIn contrast, VLIW executes operations in parallel, based on a fixed schedule, determined when programs are compiled. Since determining the order of execution of operations (including which operations can execute simultaneously) is handled by the compiler, the processor does not need the scheduling hardware that the three methods described above require. Thus, VLIW CPUs offer more computing with less hardware complexity (but greater compiler complexity) than do most superscalar CPUs. This is also complementary to the idea that as many computations as possible should be done before the program is executed, at compile time.\nDesign.\nIn superscalar designs, the number of execution units is invisible to the instruction set. Each instruction encodes one operation only. For most superscalar designs, the instruction width is 32 bits or fewer.\nIn contrast, one VLIW instruction encodes multiple operations, at least one operation for each execution unit of a device. For example, if a VLIW device has five execution units, then a VLIW instruction for the device has five operation fields, each field specifying what operation should be done on that corresponding execution unit. To accommodate these operation fields, VLIW instructions are usually at least 64 bits wide, and far wider on some architectures.\nFor example, the following is an instruction for the Super Harvard Architecture Single-Chip Computer (SHARC). In one cycle, it does a floating-point multiply, a floating-point add, and two autoincrement loads. All of this fits in one 48-bit instruction:\ncodice_1\nSince the earliest days of computer architecture, some CPUs have added several arithmetic logic units (ALUs) to run in parallel. Superscalar CPUs use hardware to decide which operations can run in parallel at runtime, while VLIW CPUs use software (the compiler) to decide which operations can run in parallel in advance. Because the complexity of instruction scheduling is moved into the compiler, complexity of hardware can be reduced substantially.\nA similar problem occurs when the result of a parallelizable instruction is used as input for a branch. Most modern CPUs \"guess\" which branch will be taken even before the calculation is complete, so that they can load the instructions for the branch, or (in some architectures) even start to compute them speculatively. If the CPU guesses wrong, all of these instructions and their context need to be \"flushed\" and the correct ones loaded, which takes time.\nThis has led to increasingly complex instruction-dispatch logic that attempts to guess correctly, and the simplicity of the original reduced instruction set computing (RISC) designs has been eroded. VLIW lacks this logic, and thus lacks its energy use, possible design defects, and other negative aspects.\nIn a VLIW, the compiler uses heuristics or profile information to guess the direction of a branch. This allows it to move and preschedule operations speculatively before the branch is taken, favoring the most likely path it expects through the branch. If the branch takes an unexpected way, the compiler has already generated compensating code to discard speculative results to preserve program semantics.\nVector processor cores (designed for large one-dimensional arrays of data called \"vectors\") can be combined with the VLIW architecture such as in the Fujitsu FR-V microprocessor, further increasing throughput and speed.\nImplementations.\nCydrome was a company producing VLIW numeric processors using emitter-coupled logic (ECL) integrated circuits in the same timeframe (late 1980s). This company, like Multiflow, failed after a few years.\nOne of the licensees of the Multiflow technology is Hewlett-Packard, which Josh Fisher joined after Multiflow's demise. Bob Rau, founder of Cydrome, also joined HP after Cydrome failed. These two would lead computer architecture research at Hewlett-Packard during the 1990s.\nAlong with the above systems, during the same time (1989\u20131990), Intel implemented VLIW in the Intel i860, their first 64-bit microprocessor, and the first processor to implement VLIW on one chip. This processor could operate in both simple RISC mode and VLIW mode:\nIn the early 1990s, Intel introduced the i860 RISC microprocessor. This simple chip had two modes of operation: a scalar mode and a VLIW mode. In the VLIW mode, the processor always fetched two instructions and assumed that one was an integer instruction and the other floating-point.\nThe i860's VLIW mode was used extensively in embedded digital signal processor (DSP) applications since the application execution and datasets were simple, well ordered and predictable, allowing designers to fully exploit the parallel execution advantages enabled by VLIW. In VLIW mode, the i860 could maintain floating-point performance in the range of 20-40 double-precision MFLOPS; a very high value for its time and for a processor running at 25-50Mhz.\nIn the 1990s, Hewlett-Packard researched this problem as a side effect of ongoing work on their PA-RISC processor family. They found that the CPU could be greatly simplified by removing the complex dispatch logic from the CPU and placing it in the compiler. Compilers of the day were far more complex than those of the 1980s, so the added complexity in the compiler was considered to be a small cost.\nVLIW CPUs are usually made of multiple RISC-like execution units that operate independently. Contemporary VLIWs usually have four to eight main execution units. Compilers generate initial instruction sequences for the VLIW CPU in roughly the same manner as for traditional CPUs, generating a sequence of RISC-like instructions. The compiler analyzes this code for dependence relationships and resource requirements. It then schedules the instructions according to those constraints. In this process, independent instructions can be scheduled in parallel. Because VLIWs typically represent instructions scheduled in parallel with a longer instruction word that incorporates the individual instructions, this results in a much longer opcode (termed \"very long\") to specify what executes on a given cycle.\nExamples of contemporary VLIW CPUs include the TriMedia media processors by NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors), the Super Harvard Architecture Single-Chip Computer (SHARC) DSP by Analog Devices, the ST200 family by STMicroelectronics based on the Lx architecture (designed in Josh Fisher's HP lab by Paolo Faraboschi), the FR-V from Fujitsu, the BSP15/16 from Pixelworks, the CEVA-X DSP from CEVA, the Jazz DSP from Improv Systems, the HiveFlex series from Silicon Hive, and the MPPA Manycore family by Kalray. The Texas Instruments TMS320 DSP line has evolved, in its C6000 family, to look more like a VLIW, in contrast to the earlier C5000 family. One or more Qualcomm Hexagons can be found in most cell phones today. These contemporary VLIW CPUs are mainly successful as embedded media processors for consumer electronic devices.\nVLIW features have also been added to configurable processor cores for system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. For example, Tensilica's Xtensa LX2 processor incorporates a technology named Flexible Length Instruction eXtensions (FLIX) that allows multi-operation instructions. The Xtensa C/C++ compiler can freely intermix 32- or 64-bit FLIX instructions with the Xtensa processor's one-operation RISC instructions, which are 16 or 24 bits wide. By packing multiple operations into a wide 32- or 64-bit instruction word and allowing these multi-operation instructions to intermix with shorter RISC instructions, FLIX allows SoC designers to realize VLIW's performance advantages while eliminating the code bloat of early VLIW architectures.\nThe Infineon Carmel DSP is another VLIW processor core intended for SoC. It uses a similar code density improvement method called \"configurable long instruction word\" (CLIW).\nOutside embedded processing markets, Intel's Itanium IA-64 explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC) and Elbrus 2000 appear as the only examples of a widely used VLIW CPU architectures. However, EPIC architecture is sometimes distinguished from a pure VLIW architecture, since EPIC advocates full instruction predication, rotating register files, and a very long instruction word that can encode non-parallel instruction groups. VLIWs also gained significant consumer penetration in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, though both Nvidia and AMD have since moved to RISC architectures to improve performance on non-graphics workloads.\nATI Technologies' (ATI) and Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) TeraScale microarchitecture for graphics processing units (GPUs) is a VLIW microarchitecture.\nIn December 2015, the first shipment of PCs based on VLIW CPU Elbrus-4s was made in Russia.\nThe Neo by REX Computing is a processor consisting of a 2D mesh of VLIW cores aimed at power efficiency.\nThe Elbrus 2000 () and its successors are Russian 512-bit wide VLIW microprocessors developed by Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies (MCST) and fabricated by TSMC.\nBackward compatibility.\nWhen silicon technology allowed for wider implementations (with more execution units) to be built, the compiled programs for the earlier generation would not run on the wider implementations, as the encoding of binary instructions depended on the number of execution units of the machine.\nTransmeta addressed this issue by including a binary-to-binary software compiler layer (termed \"code morphing\") in their Crusoe implementation of the x86 architecture. This mechanism was advertised to basically recompile, optimize, and translate x86 opcodes at runtime into the CPU's internal machine code. Thus, the Transmeta chip is \"internally\" a VLIW processor, effectively decoupled from the x86 CISC instruction set that it executes.\nIntel's Itanium architecture (among others) solved the backward-compatibility problem with a more general mechanism. Within each of the multiple-opcode instructions, a bit field is allocated to denote dependency on the prior VLIW instruction within the program instruction stream. These bits are set at compile time, thus relieving the hardware from calculating this dependency information. Having this dependency information encoded in the instruction stream allows wider implementations to issue multiple non-dependent VLIW instructions in parallel per cycle, while narrower implementations would issue a smaller number of VLIW instructions per cycle.\nAnother perceived deficiency of VLIW designs is the code bloat that occurs when one or more execution unit(s) have no useful work to do and thus must execute \"No Operation\" NOP instructions. This occurs when there are dependencies in the code and the instruction pipelines must be allowed to drain before later operations can proceed.\nSince the number of transistors on a chip has grown, the perceived disadvantages of the VLIW have diminished in importance. VLIW architectures are growing in popularity, especially in the embedded system market, where it is possible to customize a processor for an application in a system-on-a-chip.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For a smooth function, the Taylor polynomial is the truncation at the order \"formula_1\" of the Taylor series of the function. The first-order Taylor polynomial is the linear approximation of the function, and the second-order Taylor polynomial is often referred to as the quadratic approximation. There are several versions of Taylor's theorem, some giving explicit estimates of the approximation error of the function by its Taylor polynomial.\nTaylor's theorem is named after Brook Taylor, who stated a version of it in 1715, although an earlier version of the result was already mentioned in 1671 by James Gregory.\nTaylor's theorem is taught in introductory-level calculus courses and is one of the central elementary tools in mathematical analysis. It gives simple arithmetic formulas to accurately compute values of many transcendental functions such as the exponential function and trigonometric functions.\nIt is the starting point of the study of analytic functions, and is fundamental in various areas of mathematics, as well as in numerical analysis and mathematical physics. Taylor's theorem also generalizes to multivariate and vector valued functions. It provided the mathematical basis for some landmark early computing machines: Charles Babbage's difference engine calculated sines, cosines, logarithms, and other transcendental functions by numerically integrating the first 7 terms of their Taylor series.\nMotivation.\nIf a real-valued function formula_5 is differentiable at the point formula_6, then it has a linear approximation near this point. This means that there exists a function \"h\"1(\"x\") such that\nformula_7\nHere\nformula_8\nis the linear approximation of formula_5 for \"x\" near the point \"a\", whose graph formula_10 is the tangent line to the graph formula_11 at \"x\" = \"a\". The error in the approximation is:\nformula_12\nAs \"x\" tends to\u00a0\"a,\" this error goes to zero much faster than formula_13, making formula_14 a useful approximation.\nFor a better approximation to formula_5, we can fit a quadratic polynomial instead of a linear function:\nformula_16\nInstead of just matching one derivative of formula_5 at formula_6, this polynomial has the same first and second derivatives, as is evident upon differentiation.\nTaylor's theorem ensures that the \"quadratic approximation\" is, in a sufficiently small neighborhood of formula_6, more accurate than the linear approximation. Specifically,\nformula_20\nHere the error in the approximation is\nformula_21\nwhich, given the limiting behavior of formula_22, goes to zero faster than formula_23 as \"x\" tends to\u00a0\"a\".\n Similarly, we might get still better approximations to \"f\" if we use polynomials of higher degree, since then we can match even more derivatives with \"f\" at the selected base point.\nIn general, the error in approximating a function by a polynomial of degree \"k\" will go to zero much faster than formula_24 as \"x\" tends to\u00a0\"a\". However, there are functions, even infinitely differentiable ones, for which increasing the degree of the approximating polynomial does not increase the accuracy of approximation: we say such a function fails to be analytic at \"x = a\": it is not (locally) determined by its derivatives at this point.\nTaylor's theorem is of asymptotic nature: it only tells us that the error formula_25 in an approximation by a formula_1-th order Taylor polynomial \"Pk\" tends to zero faster than any nonzero formula_1-th degree polynomial as formula_28. It does not tell us how large the error is in any concrete neighborhood of the center of expansion, but for this purpose there are explicit formulas for the remainder term (given below) which are valid under some additional regularity assumptions on \"f\". These enhanced versions of Taylor's theorem typically lead to uniform estimates for the approximation error in a small neighborhood of the center of expansion, but the estimates do not necessarily hold for neighborhoods which are too large, even if the function \"f\" is analytic. In that situation one may have to select several Taylor polynomials with different centers of expansion to have reliable Taylor-approximations of the original function (see animation on the right.)\nThere are several ways we might use the remainder term:\nTaylor's theorem in one real variable.\nStatement of the theorem.\nThe precise statement of the most basic version of Taylor's theorem is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTaylor's theorem\u2014 Let formula_32 be an integer and let the function formula_33 be formula_34 times differentiable at the point formula_35. Then there exists a function formula_36 such that\nformula_37\nand\nformula_38\nThis is called the Peano form of the remainder.\nThe polynomial appearing in Taylor's theorem is the formula_39-th order Taylor polynomial\nformula_40\nof the function formula_41 at the point formula_42. The Taylor polynomial is the unique \"asymptotic best fit\" polynomial in the sense that if there exists a function formula_36 and a formula_1-th order polynomial \"p\" such that\nformula_45\nthen formula_46. Taylor's theorem describes the asymptotic behavior of the remainder term\nformula_47\nwhich is the approximation error when approximating \"f\" with its Taylor polynomial. Using the little-o notation, the statement in Taylor's theorem reads as\nformula_48\nExplicit formulas for the remainder.\nUnder stronger regularity assumptions on \"f\" there are several precise formulas for the remainder term \"Rk\" of the Taylor polynomial, the most common ones being the following.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMean-value forms of the remainder\u2014 Let \"f\" : R \u2192 R be \"k\"\u00a0+\u00a01 times differentiable on the open interval between formula_49 and formula_50 with \"f\"(\"k\") continuous on the closed interval between formula_49 and formula_50. Then\nformula_53\nfor some real number formula_54 between formula_49 and formula_50. This is the Lagrange form of the remainder.\nSimilarly,\nformula_57\nfor some real number formula_58 between formula_49 and formula_50. This is the Cauchy form of the remainder.\nBoth can be thought of as specific cases of the following result: Consider formula_61\nformula_62\nfor some real number formula_63 between formula_49 and formula_50. This is the Schl\u00f6milch form of the remainder (sometimes called the Schl\u00f6milch-Roche). The choice formula_66 is the Lagrange form, whilst the choice formula_67 is the Cauchy form.\nThese refinements of Taylor's theorem are usually proved using the mean value theorem, whence the name. Additionally, notice that this is precisely the mean value theorem when formula_68. Also other similar expressions can be found. For example, if \"G\"(\"t\") is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable with a non-vanishing derivative on the open interval between formula_69 and formula_70, then\nformula_71\nfor some number formula_72 between formula_69 and formula_70. This version covers the Lagrange and Cauchy forms of the remainder as special cases, and is proved below using Cauchy's mean value theorem. The Lagrange form is obtained by taking formula_75 and the Cauchy form is obtained by taking formula_76.\nThe statement for the integral form of the remainder is more advanced than the previous ones, and requires understanding of Lebesgue integration theory for the full generality. However, it holds also in the sense of Riemann integral provided the (\"k\"\u00a0+\u00a01)th derivative of \"f\" is continuous on the closed interval [\"a\",\"x\"].\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIntegral form of the remainder\u2014Let formula_77 be absolutely continuous on the closed interval between formula_49 and formula_50. Then\nformula_80\nDue to the absolute continuity of \"f\"(\"k\") on the closed interval between formula_49 and formula_50, its derivative \"f\"(\"k\"+1) exists as an \"L\"1-function, and the result can be proven by a formal calculation using the fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts.\nEstimates for the remainder.\nIt is often useful in practice to be able to estimate the remainder term appearing in the Taylor approximation, rather than having an exact formula for it. Suppose that \"f\" is (\"k\" + 1)-times continuously differentiable in an interval \"I\" containing \"a\". Suppose that there are real constants \"q\" and \"Q\" such that\nformula_83\nthroughout \"I\". Then the remainder term satisfies the inequality\nformula_84\nif \"x\" &gt; \"a\", and a similar estimate if \"x\" &lt; \"a\". This is a simple consequence of the Lagrange form of the remainder. In particular, if\nformula_85\non an interval \"I\" = (\"a\" \u2212 \"r\",\"a\" + \"r\") with some formula_86 , then\nformula_87\nExample in two dimensions.\nFor example, the third-order Taylor polynomial of a smooth function formula_88 is, denoting formula_89,\nformula_90\nProofs.\nProof for Taylor's theorem in one real variable.\nLet\nformula_91\nwhere, as in the statement of Taylor's theorem,\nformula_92\nIt is sufficient to show that\nformula_93\nThe proof here is based on repeated application of L'H\u00f4pital's rule. Note that, for each formula_94, formula_95. Hence each of the first formula_96 derivatives of the numerator in formula_97 vanishes at formula_98, and the same is true of the denominator. Also, since the condition that the function formula_99 be formula_1 times differentiable at a point requires differentiability up to order formula_96 in a neighborhood of said point (this is true, because differentiability requires a function to be defined in a whole neighborhood of a point), the numerator and its formula_102 derivatives are differentiable in a neighborhood of formula_69. Clearly, the denominator also satisfies said condition, and additionally, doesn't vanish unless formula_6, therefore all conditions necessary for L'H\u00f4pital's rule are fulfilled, and its use is justified. So\nformula_105\nwhere the second-to-last equality follows by the definition of the derivative at formula_106.\nAlternate proof for Taylor's theorem in one real variable.\nLet formula_107 be any real-valued continuous function to be approximated by the Taylor polynomial.\nStep 1: Let formula_108 and formula_109 be functions. Set formula_108 and formula_109 to be\nformula_112\nformula_113\nStep 2: Properties of formula_108 and formula_109:\nformula_116\nSimilarly, \nformula_117\nformula_118\nStep 3: Use Cauchy Mean Value Theorem\nLet formula_119 and formula_120 be continuous functions on formula_121. Since formula_122 so we can work with the interval formula_123. Let formula_119 and formula_120 be differentiable on formula_126. Assume formula_127 for all formula_128.\nThen there exists formula_129 such that\nformula_130\nNote: formula_131 in formula_132 and formula_133 so\nformula_134\nfor some formula_129.\nThis can also be performed for formula_136:\nformula_137\nfor some formula_138.\nThis can be continued to formula_139.\nThis gives a partition in formula_132:\nformula_141\nwith\nformula_142\nSet formula_143:\nformula_144\nStep 4: Substitute back\nformula_145\nBy the Power Rule, repeated derivatives of formula_146, formula_147, so:\nformula_148\nThis leads to:\nformula_149\nBy rearranging, we get:\nformula_150\nor because formula_151 eventually:\nformula_152\nDerivation for the mean value forms of the remainder.\nLet \"G\" be any real-valued function, continuous on the closed interval between formula_49 and formula_50 and differentiable with a non-vanishing derivative on the open interval between formula_49 and formula_50, and define\nformula_157\nFor formula_158. Then, by Cauchy's mean value theorem,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nfor some formula_72 on the open interval between formula_49 and formula_50. Note that here the numerator formula_162 is exactly the remainder of the Taylor polynomial for formula_11. Compute\nformula_164\nplug it into (\u2605\u2605\u2605) and rearrange terms to find that\nformula_165\nThis is the form of the remainder term mentioned after the actual statement of Taylor's theorem with remainder in the mean value form.\nThe Lagrange form of the remainder is found by choosing formula_166 and the Cauchy form by choosing formula_167.\nRemark. Using this method one can also recover the integral form of the remainder by choosing\nformula_168\nbut the requirements for \"f\" needed for the use of mean value theorem are too strong, if one aims to prove the claim in the case that \"f\"(\"k\") is only absolutely continuous. However, if one uses Riemann integral instead of Lebesgue integral, the assumptions cannot be weakened.\nDerivation for the integral form of the remainder.\nDue to the absolute continuity of formula_169 on the closed interval between formula_49 and formula_50, its derivative formula_172 exists as an formula_173-function, and we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus and integration by parts. This same proof applies for the Riemann integral assuming that formula_169 is continuous on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval between formula_49 and formula_50, and this leads to the same result as using the mean value theorem.\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus states that\nformula_177\nNow we can integrate by parts and use the fundamental theorem of calculus again to see that\nformula_178\nwhich is exactly Taylor's theorem with remainder in the integral form in the case formula_179. The general statement is proved using induction. Suppose that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIntegrating the remainder term by parts we arrive at\nformula_180\nSubstituting this into the formula in (eq1) shows that if it holds for the value formula_34, it must also hold for the value formula_182. Therefore, since it holds for formula_179, it must hold for every positive integer formula_34.\nDerivation for the remainder of multivariate Taylor polynomials.\nWe prove the special case, where formula_185 has continuous partial derivatives up to the order formula_182 in some closed ball formula_187 with center formula_188. The strategy of the proof is to apply the one-variable case of Taylor's theorem to the restriction of formula_41 to the line segment adjoining formula_190 and formula_188. Parametrize the line segment between formula_188 and formula_190 by formula_194 We apply the one-variable version of Taylor's theorem to the function formula_195:\nformula_196\nApplying the chain rule for several variables gives\nformula_197\nwhere formula_198 is the multinomial coefficient. Since formula_199, we get:\nformula_200\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

President Harry S. Truman signed the McMahon/Atomic Energy Act on August 1, 1946, transferring the control of atomic energy from military to civilian hands, effective on January 1, 1947. This shift gave the members of the AEC complete control of the plants, laboratories, equipment, and personnel assembled during the war to produce the atomic bomb.\nAn increasing number of critics during the 1960s charged that the AEC's regulations were insufficiently rigorous in several important areas, including radiation protection standards, nuclear reactor safety, plant siting, and environmental protection.\nBy 1974, the AEC's regulatory programs had come under such strong attack that the U.S. Congress decided to abolish the AEC. The AEC was abolished by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which assigned its functions to two new agencies: the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. On August 4, 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed into law the Department of Energy Organization Act, which created the Department of Energy. The new agency assumed the responsibilities of the Federal Energy Administration (FEA), the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), the Federal Power Commission (FPC), and various other federal agencies.\nHistory.\nIn creating the AEC, Congress declared that atomic energy should be employed not only in the form of nuclear weapons for the nation's defense, but also to promote world peace, improve the public welfare and strengthen free competition in private enterprise. At the same time, the McMahon Act which created the AEC also gave it unprecedented powers of regulation over the entire field of nuclear science and technology. It furthermore explicitly prevented technology transfer between the United States and other countries, and required FBI investigations for all scientists or industrial contractors who wished to have access to any AEC controlled nuclear information. The signing was the culmination of long months of intensive debate among politicians, military planners and atomic scientists over the fate of this new energy source and the means by which it would be regulated. President Truman appointed David Lilienthal as the first Chairman of the AEC. \nCongress gave the new civilian AEC extraordinary power and considerable independence to carry out its mission. To provide the AEC exceptional freedom in hiring its scientists and engineers, AEC employees were exempt from the civil service system. The AEC's first order of business was to inspect the scattered empire of atomic plants and laboratories to be inherited from the U.S. Army.\nBecause of the great need for security, all production facilities and nuclear reactors would be government-owned, while all technical information and research results would be under AEC control. The National Laboratory system was established from the facilities created under the Manhattan Project. Argonne National Laboratory was one of the first laboratories authorized under this legislation as a contractor-operated facility dedicated to fulfilling the new AEC's missions. Argonne was the first of the regional laboratories to involve universities in the Chicago area. Others were the Clinton (CEW) labs and the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the Northeast, although a similar lab in Southern California did not eventuate.\nOn 11 March 1948 Lilienthal and Kenneth Nichols were summoned to the White House where Truman told them \"I know you two hate each other's guts\". He directed that \"the primary objective of the AEC was to develop and produce atomic weapons\", Nichols was appointed a major general and replaced Leslie Groves as chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP); previously Lilienthal had opposed his appointment. Lilienthal was told to \"forgo your desire to place a bottle of milk on every doorstop and get down to the business of producing atomic weapons.\" Nichols became General Manager of the AEC on 2 November 1953.\nThe AEC was in charge of developing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, taking over these responsibilities from the wartime Manhattan Project. In its first decade, the AEC oversaw the operation of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, devoted primarily to weapons development, and in 1952, the creation of new second weapons laboratory in California, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The AEC also carried out the \"crash program\" to develop the hydrogen bomb (H-bomb), and the AEC played a key role in the prosecution of the Rosenbergs for espionage.\nThe AEC also began a program of regular nuclear weapons testing, both in the faraway Pacific Proving Grounds and at the Nevada Test Site in the western United States. While the AEC also supported much basic research, the vast majority of its early budget was devoted to nuclear weapons development and production.\nAfter serving as director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer voiced strong opinions to the AEC, as chairman of its general advisory board of nuclear scientists, against development of the \"super\" or hydrogen bomb along with Lilienthal. Subsequently, Lilienthal left the AEC at the White House's request in 1950 and Oppenheimer's appointment to the board was not renewed in 1952. With them removed, President Truman announced his decision to develop and produce the hydrogen bomb. The first test firing of an experimental H-bomb (\"Ivy Mike\") was carried out in the Central Pacific on November 1, 1952, under President Truman. Furthermore, U.S. Navy Admiral Lewis W. Strauss was appointed in 1953 by the new President Eisenhower as the Chairman of the AEC, to carry out the military development and production of the H-bomb.\nLilienthal wanted to give high priority to peaceful uses, especially with nuclear power plants. However, coal was still cheap, and the electric power industry was not interested. The first experimental nuclear power plant Shippingport began operation in Pennsylvania under President Eisenhower in 1954.\nDomestic uranium procurement program.\nThe AEC developed a program for sourcing uranium domestically. Before 1947, the main sources for the mineral had been Canada and (what was then) the Belgian Congo, though the Manhattan Project also secretly processed uranium from the tailings of vanadium plants in the US West during World War II. The Colorado Plateau was known to contain veins of carnotite ore, which contains both vanadium and uranium. The AEC developed its program in accordance with the principle of free enterprise. Rather than discovering, mining, and processing the ore itself, the federal government provided geological information, built roads, and set a fixed rate for purchasing ore through one of the mills in the area. This prompted individuals to discover and produce the ore, which the government would then buy. The AEC was the only legal buyer of uranium from the beginning of the program in 1947 through 1966. From 1966 to the end of the program in 1970, the AEC continued to buy uranium to support the market until private industry could develop sufficiently.\nBecause the government itself was not producing ore, it claimed that it had no obligation to regulate miner safety. A congressional report published in 1995 concluded that, \"The government failed to act to require the reduction of the hazard by ventilating the mines, and it failed to adequately warn the miners of the hazard to which they were being exposed.\" The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 sought to compensate miners and families who developed cancer as a result of exposure to radon gas in uranium mines.\nRegulations and experiments.\nThe AEC was connected with the U.S. Department of Defense by a \"Military Liaison Committee\"'. The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy exercised congressional oversight over the AEC and had considerable power in influencing AEC decisions and policy.\nThe AEC's far-reaching powers and control over a subject matter which had far-reaching social, public health, and military implications made it an extremely controversial organization. One of the drafters of the McMahon Act, James R. Newman, famously concluded that the bill made \"the field of atomic energy [an] island of socialism in the midst of a free-enterprise economy\".\nBefore the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was created, nuclear regulation was the responsibility of the AEC, which Congress first established in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. Eight years later, Congress replaced that law with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which for the first time made the development of commercial nuclear power possible, and resolved a number of other outstanding problems in implementing the first Atomic Energy Act. The act assigned the AEC the functions of both encouraging the use of nuclear power and regulating its safety. The AEC's regulatory programs sought to ensure public health and safety from the hazards of nuclear power without imposing excessive requirements that would inhibit the growth of the industry. This was a difficult goal to achieve, especially in a new industry, and within a short time the AEC's programs stirred considerable controversy. Stephanie Cooke has written that:\nthe AEC had become an oligarchy controlling all facets of the military and civilian sides of nuclear energy, promoting them and at the same time attempting to regulate them, and it had fallen down on the regulatory side ... a growing legion of critics saw too many inbuilt conflicts of interest.\nThe AEC had a history of involvement in experiments involving radioactive iodine. In a 1949 operation called the \"Green Run\", the AEC released iodine-131 and xenon-133 to the atmosphere which contaminated a area containing three small towns near the Hanford site in Washington. In 1953, the AEC ran several studies on the health effects of radioactive iodine in newborns and pregnant women at the University of Iowa. Also in 1953, the AEC sponsored a study to discover if radioactive iodine affected premature babies differently from full-term babies. In the experiment, researchers from Harper Hospital in Detroit orally administered iodine-131 to 65 premature and full-term infants who weighed from . In another AEC study, researchers at the University of Nebraska College of Medicine fed iodine-131 to 28 healthy infants through a gastric tube to test the concentration of iodine in the infants' thyroid glands.\nPublic opinion and abolition of the AEC.\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, the Atomic Energy Commission came under fire from opposition concerned with more fundamental ecological problems such as the pollution of air and water. Under the Nixon Administration, environmental consciousness grew exponentially and the first Earth Day was held on April 22, 1970. Along with rising environmental awareness came a growing suspicion of the AEC and public hostility for their projects increased. In the public eye, there was a strong association between nuclear power and nuclear weapons, and even though the AEC had made a push in the late 1960s, to portray their efforts as being geared toward peaceful uses of atomic energy, criticism of the agency grew. The AEC was chiefly held responsible for the health problems of people living near atmospheric test sites from the early 1960s, and there was a strong association of nuclear energy with the radioactive fallout from these tests. Around the same time, the AEC was also struggling with opposition to nuclear power plant siting as well as nuclear testing. An organized push was finally made to curb the power held by the AEC, and in 1970 the AEC was forced to prepare an Environmental impact statement (EIS) for a nuclear test in northwestern Colorado as part of the initial preparation for Project Rio Blanco.\nIn 1973, the AEC predicted that, by the turn of the century, one thousand reactors would be needed producing electricity for homes and businesses across the United States. However, after 1973, orders for nuclear reactors declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose. Some partially completed nuclear power plants in the U.S. were stricken, and many planned nuclear plants were canceled.\nBy 1974, the AEC's regulatory programs had come under such strong attack that Congress decided to abolish the agency. Supporters and critics of nuclear power agreed that the promotional and regulatory duties of the AEC should be assigned to different agencies. The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 transferred the regulatory functions of the AEC to the new Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which began operations on January 19, 1975. Promotional functions went to the Energy Research and Development Administration which was later incorporated into the United States Department of Energy.\nLasting through the mid-1970s, the AEC, along with other entities including the Department of Defense, National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Society, the Manhattan Project, and various universities funded or conducted human radiation experiments. The government covered up most of these radiation mishaps until 1993, when President Bill Clinton ordered a change of policy. Nuclear radiation was known to be dangerous and deadly (from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945), and the experiments were designed to ascertain the detailed effect of radiation on human health. In Oregon, 67 prisoners with inadequate consent to vasectomies had their testicles exposed to irradiation. In Chicago, 102 volunteers with unclear consent received injections of strontium and cesium solutions to simulate radioactive fallout.\nRelationship with science.\nEcology.\nFor many years, the AEC provided the most conspicuous example of the benefit of atomic age technologies to biology and medicine.\nShortly after the Atomic Energy Commission was established, its Division of Biology and Medicine began supporting diverse programs of research in the life sciences, mainly the fields of genetics, physiology, and ecology. Specifically concerning the AEC's relationship with the field of ecology, one of the first approved funding grants went to Eugene Odum in 1951. This grant sought to observe and document the effects of radiation emission on the environment from a recently built nuclear facility on the Savannah River in South Carolina. Odum, a professor at the University of Georgia, initially submitted a proposal requesting annual funding of $267,000, but the AEC rejected the proposal and instead offered to fund a $10,000 project to observe local animal populations and the effects of secondary succession on abandoned farmland around the nuclear plant.\nIn 1961, AEC chairman Glenn T. Seaborg established the Technical Analysis Branch (to be directed by Hal Hollister) to study the long-term biological and ecological effects of nuclear war. Throughout the early 1960s, this group of scientists conducted several studies to determine nuclear weapons' ecological consequences and their implications for human life. As a result, during the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. government placed emphasis on the development and potential use of \"clean\" nuclear weapons to mitigate these effects.\nIn later years, the AEC began providing increased research opportunities to scientists by approving funding for ecological studies at various nuclear testing sites, most notably at Eniwetok, which was part of the Marshall Islands. Through their support of nuclear testing, the AEC gave ecologists a unique opportunity to study the effects of radiation on whole populations and entire ecological systems in the field. Prior to 1954, no one had investigated a complete ecosystem with the intent to measure its overall metabolism, but the AEC provided the means as well as the funding to do so. Ecological development was further spurred by environmental concerns about radioactive waste from nuclear energy and postwar atomic weapons production. In the 1950s, such concerns led the AEC to build a large ecology research group at their Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which was instrumental in the development of radioecology. A wide variety of research efforts in biology and medicine took place under the umbrella of the AEC at national laboratories and at some universities with agency sponsorship and funding. As a result of increased funding as well as the increased opportunities given to scientists and the field of ecology in general, a plethora of new techniques were developed which led to rapid growth and expansion of the field as a whole. One of these techniques afforded to ecologists involved the use of radiation, namely in ecological dating and to study the effects of stresses on the environment.\nIn 1969, the AEC's relationship with science and the environment was brought to the forefront of a growing public controversy that had been building since 1965. In search for an ideal location for a large-yield nuclear test, the AEC settled upon the island of Amchitka, part of the Aleutian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The main public concern was about their location choice, as there was a large colony of endangered sea otters in close proximity. To help defuse the issue, the AEC sought a formal agreement with the Department of the Interior and the U.S. state of Alaska to help transplant the colony of sea otters to other former habitats along the West Coast.\nArctic ecology.\nThe AEC played a role in expanding the field of arctic ecology. From 1959 to 1962, the Commission's interest in this type of research peaked. For the first time, extensive effort was placed by a national agency on funding bio-environmental research in the Arctic. Research took place at Cape Thompson on the northwest coast of Alaska, and was tied to an excavation proposal named Project Chariot. The excavation project was to involve a series of underground nuclear detonations that would create an artificial harbor, consisting of a channel and circular terminal basin, which would fill with water. This would have allowed for enhanced ecological research of the area in conjunction with any nuclear testing that might occur, as it essentially would have created a controlled environment where levels and patterns of radioactive fallout resulting from weapons testing could be measured. The proposal never went through, but it evidenced the AEC's interest in Arctic research and development.\nThe simplicity of biotic compositions and ecological processes in the arctic regions of the globe made ideal locations in which to pursue ecological research, especially since at the time there was minimal human modification of the landscape. All investigations conducted by the AEC produced new data from the Arctic, but few or none of them were supported solely on that basis. While the development of ecology and other sciences was not always the primary objective of the AEC, support was often given to research in these fields indirectly as an extension of their efforts for peaceful applications of nuclear energy.\nReports.\nThe AEC issued a large number of technical reports through their technical information service and other channels. These had many numbering schemes, often associated with the lab from which the report was issued. AEC report numbers included AEC-AECU (unclassified), AEC-AECD (declassified), AEC-BNL (Brookhaven National Lab), AEC-HASL (Health and Safety Laboratory), AEC-HW (Hanford Works), AEC-IDO (Idaho Operations Office), AEC-LA (Los Alamos), AEC-MDCC (Manhattan District), AEC-TID (Technical Information Division), and others. Today, these reports can be found in library collections that received government documents, through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), and through public domain digitization projects such as the Technical Report Archive &amp; Image Library, which are available via HathiTrust.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As air transportation reliability improved and cost per ounce of mail decreased, it began to make financial sense to transport larger quantities of mail via intercontinental airlines rather than ship, and interstate via the old airmail routes rather than via train. But this made the sorting of mail by hand the new \"bottleneck\" for mail service. Rather than leisurely hand sorting mail bound for various destinations while passenger trains traveled between town centers, there was a need for machine sorting speed that could match the increased volume traveling between communities by jet and direct trucking.\nRather than being sorted within a city, destined for another city, the structure of delivery had by necessity become sorting at regional sorting centers that were connected by various modes of transport (rail, air and road), with the regional centers responsible for routing mail and packages to each local post office in their region.\nIn 1944, Moon submitted his idea for the while working as a postal inspector in Philadelphia, but no action was taken. Following his third submission of the concept, in 1963 it received the approval of a top-level postal service committee which shares credit for further development of the Zoning Improvement Plan, \"ZIP\". Mr. Moon's system described the routing to general regions of the country using the first three digits of what would eventually become a five-digit and later a nine-digit system. The next two digits of the first five-digit numeric code would be for smaller delivery areas, and were the work of others. The first \"Directory of Post Offices\" using five-digit ZIP code numbers would be published in 1963.\nThe \"Mr. ZIP\" cartoon character that was seen on postal delivery vehicles across the United States was originally developed by ad man Harold Wilcox, whose father was a postman. Wilcox's agency, Cunningham &amp; Walsh, originally displayed the image for a Chase Manhattan bank-by-mail campaign.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The program was released on March 10, 1995, and discontinued in early 1996. Microsoft Bob presented screens showing a house, with rooms that the user could visit containing familiar objects corresponding to computer applications, such as a desk with pen and paper and a checkbook. Clicking on the pen and paper would open the system's word processor. A cartoon dog named Rover and other cartoon characters provided guidance using speech balloons.\nUpon release, Microsoft Bob was criticized in the media and did not gain wide acceptance with users, which resulted in its discontinuation. Its legacy would be observed in future Microsoft products, notably the use of virtual assistants. The Rover character later reappeared as a Windows XP search companion.\nHistory.\nMicrosoft Bob was released in March 1995 (before Windows 95 was released), although it had been widely publicized under the codename Utopia. The project leader for Bob was Karen Fries, a Microsoft researcher. The design was based on research by professors Clifford Nass and Byron Reeves of Stanford University. Melinda Gates, then wife of Bill Gates, was the marketing manager for the product. Microsoft originally purchased the domain name bob.com from Boston-area techie Bob Antia, but later traded it to Bob Kerstein for the windows2000.com domain name.\nApplications.\nMicrosoft Bob includes various office-suite programs such as a finance application and a word processor. The user interface was designed to simplify the navigational experience for novice computer users.\nSimilar to early graphical shells like Jane, the main interface is portrayed as the inside of a house, with different rooms corresponding to common real-world room styles such as a kitchen or family room. Each room contains decorations and furniture, as well as icons that represent applications. The user may also fully customize the entire house and has full control over each room's decoration. The user may add, remove or reposition all objects. The user can also add or remove rooms and change the destinations of each door. The program offers multiple themes for room designs and decorations, such as contemporary and postmodern.\nThe applications built into Microsoft Bob are represented by matching decorations. For example, clicking on a clock opens the calendar, while a pen and paper represent the word processor. The user can also add shortcuts to applications on the computer. These shortcuts display the icon inside various styles of decorations, such as boxes and picture frames.\nBob includes the ability to install new applications, but because of the failure of the product, only a single add-on application package, Microsoft Great Greetings, was released.\nReleased just as the Internet was beginning to become popular, Bob offered an email client with which a user could subscribe to MCI Mail, a dial-up email account. The price was $5.00 per month to send up to 15 emails. Each email was limited to 5,000 characters, and each additional email after the limit was reached was an additional 45 cents. Customers were required to call a toll-free phone number to set up the account.\nBob features \"Assistants\", cartoon characters intended to help the user navigate the virtual house or perform tasks in the main interface or within the built-in applications.\nGateway 2000 edition.\nA special Gateway 2000-branded edition of Microsoft Bob 1.00a was bundled with the Gateway 2000 computer around 1995. This edition contains Gateway branding on the login screen along with additional rooms and backgrounds not seen in the retail version. One additional room is the attic, which contains the image of a Gateway 2000 computer box. In addition to the extra rooms, more icons appear by default in the new rooms.\nReception and legacy.\nAlthough a Consumer Electronics Show demonstration was met with generally positive reactions, reviewers generally derided the software, and Microsoft Bob became one of Microsoft's more visible product failures. \"The New York Times\" found the characters irritating and the home design apparently the work of an \"esthetically challenged sixth-grader,\" criticized the hardware requirements and storage file formats and concluded that the program was not as simple to use as Microsoft had advertised. \"The Washington Post\" called the home environment \"sterile\" and \"lifeless,\" wrote that the characters' cuteness wore thin quickly and criticized the scarce customization and access to Windows components. According to PC Data, the real sales from Bob's release until its discontinuation amounted to about 58,000 copies\u2014far short of Microsoft's estimate that it would sell millions as had Microsoft Works and \"Encarta\". Despite being discontinued just one year after launch, Microsoft Bob continued to be sharply criticized in reviews and popular media. In 2017, Melinda Gates acknowledged that the software \"needed a more powerful computer than most people had back then.\"\nMicrosoft Bob was listed seventh in \"PC World\" magazine's list of the 25 worst tech products of all time and as the number-one worst product of the decade by CNET.com. It was also listed among the 50 worst inventions in \"Time\" magazine, which called Bob \"overly cutesy\" and an \"operating system designed around Clippy.\" Microsoft's Steve Ballmer mentioned Bob as an example in which \"we decided that we have not succeeded and let's stop [now].\"\nMicrosoft employee Raymond Chen disclosed that an encrypted copy of Bob was included on Windows XP installation CDs in order to consume space to prevent piracy. It was thought that by consuming an additional 30 megabytes on the disc (in the era of dial-up internet access), users with 56\u00a0kbit/s modems would be dissuaded from attempting to download the software illegally. Retired Microsoft engineer David Plummer has identified himself as the employee responsible for the encrypted copy. The installer routine would check for the \"blob of Bob\" and if an \"OEM blob\" was detected, only an OEM product key would be accepted. Tech journalist Harry McCracken called the story \"a delightfully urban legend-y tale\" and noted its similarities to an April Fools' Day joke claiming that Bob was hidden in Windows Vista.\nThe use of virtual assistants in Microsoft Bob later inspired Clippit, colloquially called \"Clippy\" the paperclip, the default Office Assistant in Microsoft Office. Rover, the dog mascot character introduced with Bob, became a \"search companion\" for Windows XP's file-search function.\nMicrosoft graphic designer Vincent Connare designed the typeface Comic Sans when he noticed that Rover's speech was displayed in Times New Roman, which he felt was inappropriate for a cartoon dog. Although Connare's font did not appear in the final release of Microsoft Bob because its characters did not fit within any of the typographical grids, it later debuted in Microsoft's 3D Movie Maker and became an additional typeface for Windows 95.\nSee also.\nMicrosoft\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, she was educated at Ursuline Academy of Dallas, Duke University, and Duke's Fuqua School of Business. Shortly after joining Microsoft in 1987 as a multimedia product developer, she began dating the company's co-founder and then-chief executive Bill Gates, whom she married in 1994 and divorced in 2021. They have three children together. \nFrom 2000 to 2024, she and Gates co-chaired the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest private charitable organization. For their philanthropic endeavors, which focused on global health, development, and education, they received numerous awards and honors, including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and the French Legion of Honour. After French Gates resigned as co-chair in May 2024, Gates became sole chair of the renamed Gates Foundation.\nAs part of her divorce settlement, French Gates received $12.5 billion for independent philanthropy, which she has stated will focus on women and families. She has become a prominent megadonor to the Democratic Party, with a focus on abortion rights, and endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election. In April 2025, she published a memoir, \"The Next Day: Transition, Change and Moving Forward\".\nConsistently ranked by \"Forbes\" magazine as one of the world's most powerful women, French Gates was recognized as one of the BBC's 100 women of 2021. As of July 2025, her net worth is estimated at US$30.6 billion, according to \"Forbes\".\nEarly life and education.\nMelinda Ann French was born on August 15, 1964, in Dallas, Texas. She is the second of four children born to Raymond Joseph French Jr., an aerospace engineer, and Elaine Agnes Amerland, a homemaker. She has an older sister and two younger brothers.\nFrench Gates, a Catholic, attended St. Monica Catholic School, where she was the valedictorian of her class. At age 14, French Gates was introduced to the Apple II by her father and Mrs. Bauer, a school teacher who advocated teaching computer science at the all-girls school. It was from this experience she developed her interest in computer games and the BASIC programming language.\nFrench Gates graduated as valedictorian from Ursuline Academy of Dallas in 1982. She earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and economics from Duke University in 1986 and an MBA from Duke's Fuqua School of Business in 1987. At Duke, French Gates was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, Beta Rho Chapter.\nCareer.\nEarly career and Microsoft.\nFrench Gates's first job was tutoring children in mathematics and computer programming. After graduation, she became a marketing manager with Microsoft, being responsible for the development of multimedia products. These included Cinemania, Encarta, Publisher, Microsoft Bob, Money, Works (Macintosh) and Word. She worked on Expedia, which became one of the most popular travel booking websites. In the early 1990s, French Gates was appointed as General Manager of Information Products, a position which she held until 1996. She left Microsoft that year, reportedly, to focus on starting a family.\nCorporate directorship.\nFrench Gates served as a member of Duke University's board of trustees from 1996 to 2003. She attends the annual Bilderberg Group conference and has held a seat on the board of directors of Graham Holdings (formerly The Washington Post Company) since 2004. She was also on the board of directors at Drugstore.com but left in August 2006 to focus on philanthropic projects.\nPhilanthropy.\nSince 2000, French Gates has been in the public eye, stating \"As I thought about strong women of history, I realized that they stepped out in some way.\" This has allowed her work shaping and advancing the goals of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to be publicly recognized. By 2022, Bill and Melinda had given US$59.1 billion of their personal wealth to the foundation. On May 13, 2024, French Gates resigned as co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to be effective June 7. The foundation was subsequently renamed the Gates Foundation, with Bill Gates as its sole chair.\nIn 2015, French Gates founded Pivotal Ventures as a separate, independent organization to identify and implement innovative solutions to problems affecting U.S. women and families. In partnership with Lever for Change, an affiliate of the MacArthur Foundation French Gates announced a 2024-25 grant competition called Action for Women's Health, which aims to provide $250 million in grants to fund women's health initiatives.\nWriting.\nIn 2019, French Gates debuted as an author with the book \"The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World\". Former president Barack Obama starred in a comedy sketch to promote it. The book highlights the failure to acknowledge women's unpaid work, drawing on feminist economist Dame Marilyn Waring's book \"If Women Counted\". In 2025, she published the book \"The Next Day: Transitions, Change, and Moving Forward\".\nWomen in technology.\nFrench Gates's experience of a male-dominated workplace at Microsoft inspired her to encourage more women in the computing field. In September 2016, she announced her desire to increase diversity in the workplace, especially in the technology industry, stating: \"Every company needs technology, and yet we're graduating fewer women technologists. That is not good for society. We have to change it.\" French Gates also spoke about this topic at the 2017 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, an annual series of conferences.\nAwards and recognition.\nIn 1998, Melinda and Bill Gates were each honored with an American Library Association Honorary Membership. In 2002, Melinda and Bill Gates received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out, annually, by Jefferson Awards. In December 2005, Melinda and Bill were named, by \"Time,\" as Persons of the Year, alongside Bono. Melinda and Bill Gates received the Spanish Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation on May 4, 2006, in recognition of their world impact through charitable giving. In November 2006, French Gates was awarded the Insignia of the Order of the Aztec Eagle, together, with Bill, who was awarded the Placard of the same order, both for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program \"Un pa\u00eds de lectores\".\nIn May 2006, in honor of her work to improve the lives of children locally and around the world, Seattle Children's Hospital dedicated the Melinda French Gates Ambulatory Care building at Seattle Children's (formerly Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center). She chaired a campaign for the hospital to fundraise $300 million to expand facilities, fund under-compensated and uncompensated care, and grow the hospital's research program to find cures and treatments.\nIn 2007, French Gates received an honorary doctorate in medicine from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2009, she and her then-husband received honorary degrees from the University of Cambridge. Their benefaction of $210 million in 2000 set up the Gates Cambridge Trust, which funds postgraduate scholars from outside the UK to study at the university. Lastly, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by Duke University, in 2013, in honor of her philanthropic commitment.\nShe has been repeatedly recognized, by Forbes in its annual list of the 100 Most Powerful Women, ranking #3 in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2017, #4 in 2012 and 2016, #5 in 2020 and 2021, and #6 in 2011, 2018, 2019 and 2022, #10 in 2023. She was awarded the UCSF medal in 2013. French Gates was appointed an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 2013, for services to philanthropy and international development. In recognition of the foundation's philanthropic activities in India, Bill and Melinda, jointly, received India's third-highest civilian honor, Padma Bhushan, in 2015. In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded French Gates and her husband with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, for their philanthropic efforts.\nIn 2017, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande awarded France's highest national honor to French Gates and her husband, for their charitable efforts, i.e. as Commander of the Legion of Honour. That year, she was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal 2016 of the United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN), Berlin-Brandenburg, \"for outstanding services to peace and international understanding\" in the historic Berlin Town Hall. That year, French Gates was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 12 in the list of 200 Most Influential Philanthropists and Social Entrepreneurs Worldwide. In June 2024, she delivered the Commencement address at Stanford University.\nPolitical activity.\nAfter divorcing Bill Gates, French Gates became a prominent megadonor to the Democratic Party, with a focus on abortion rights. In the lead-up to the 2024 US presidential election, she donated over $10 million to Democratic causes. In that election, she endorsed Joe Biden and then, after he stepped aside, Kamala Harris, her first presidential endorsements.\nPersonal life.\nMelinda began dating Microsoft chief executive Bill Gates in 1987, after meeting him at a trade fair in New York. In 1994, she married Gates in a private ceremony held in L\u0101na\u02bbi, Hawaii. They have three children. The family maintained a home in an earth-sheltered mansion overlooking Lake Washington in Medina, Washington. The family also owned an oceanfront residence in Del Mar, California.\nIn May 2021, after 27 years of marriage, Bill and Melinda Gates announced their decision to divorce. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", Melinda had been meeting with divorce lawyers since at least October 2019, after Bill's business dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein became public. Although the couple did not have a prenuptial agreement, Melinda (who filed) did not request spousal support. She was allocated over $2 billion worth of shares and stocks from the divorce, although the full details of the financial settlement have not been disclosed. The divorce was finalized on August 2, 2021. She has publicly used the name Melinda French Gates, since the couple separated.\nIn October 2021, Melinda and Bill both attended the wedding of their eldest daughter Jennifer to the Olympic equestrian Nayel Nassar. In March 2022, Melinda said that she and Bill were \"friendly\" but not \"friends\". In November 2022, she was reported to be dating former Fox News correspondent Jon Du Pre. In April 2024, a spokesperson quashed rumors that French Gates and Du Pre had become engaged, confirming that the two were no longer dating. French Gates became a grandmother for the first time in March 2023, when Jennifer gave birth to a daughter.\nFrench Gates is a practicing Catholic.\nIn 2025, French Gates went public with a new relationship with Philip Vaughn, claiming she was very happy. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "51727", "revid": "19248916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51727", "title": "Moped", "text": "Small motorcycle-like motor road vehicle\nA moped ( ) is a type of small and inexpensive motorcycle, generally having a less stringent licensing requirement than full motorcycles or automobiles. Historically, the term exclusively meant a motorcycle with bicycle pedals. Mopeds typically travel only slightly faster than bicycles on public roads.\nTraditional mopeds are distinguishable by their pedals, similar to a bicycle. Some mopeds have a step-through frame design, while others have motorcycle frame designs, including a backbone and a raised fuel tank, mounted directly between the saddle and the head tube. Some resemble motorized bicycles, similar to modern ebikes. Most are similar to a regular motorcycle but with pedals and a crankset that may be used with or instead of motor drive. Although mopeds usually have two wheels, some jurisdictions classify low-powered three- or four-wheeled vehicles (including ATVs and go-karts) as a moped.\nIn some countries, a moped can be any motorcycle with an engine capacity below (most commonly or lower).\nEtymology.\nThe word \"moped\" was coined by the Swedish journalist Harald Nielsen in 1952, as a portmanteau of the Swedish words and . The claimed derivation from the term \"motor-velocipede\" is incorrect. According to Douglas Harper, the Swedish terms originated from \"(\"trampcykel med\") mo(tor och\") ped(aler\")\", which means \"pedal cycle with engine and pedals\" (the earliest versions had auxiliary pedals). Like some of the earliest two wheeled motorcycles, all mopeds were once equipped with bicycle pedals.\nHistory.\nThe term \"moped\" now only applies to low-power (often super-economy) vehicles, but pedals were fitted to some early motorcycles, such as the pictured 1912 Douglas. Pedaling away from stationary was a great improvement over \"run and jump\" and light pedal assistance (LPA) was valuable for climbing hills. Better transmissions with wider ranges, better clutches and much better engine performance made pedals obsolete on most motorcycles by 1918 but the pedals on mopeds remained valuable for their original purposes as late as the 1990s.\nThe earliest mopeds were bicycles with a helper motor in various locations, for example on top of the front wheel; they were also called cyclemotors. An example of that type is the V\u00e9loSoleX brand, which simply has a roller driving the front tire.\nA more innovative design was known in the UK as the Cyclemaster. This had a complete powered rear wheel which was simply substituted for the bicycle rear wheel, which originated from a design by two DKW engineers in Germany. Slightly larger machines, commonly with a engine were known as autocycles. On the other hand, some mopeds, such as the Czech-made Jawa, were derived from motorcycles.\nA further category of low-powered two-wheelers exists today in some jurisdictions for bicycles with helper motors \u2013 these are often defined as power-assisted bicycles or motorized bicycles. Other jurisdictions may categorize the same machines as mopeds, creating a certain amount of confusion. In many countries three-wheelers and microcars are classified as mopeds or variations thereof. This practice is not restricted to the third world; France and Belgium classify microcars such as the Aixam similarly or as \"light quadricycles\". The Ariel 3, a motorised three-wheeler is classed as a moped.\nAs of 1977, the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic considers the moped any two-wheeled or three-wheeled vehicle which is fitted with an internal combustion engine having a cylinder capacity not exceeding 50 cc.\nEmissions.\nMopeds can achieve fuel economy of over . The emissions of mopeds have been the subject of multiple studies. Studies have found that two-stroke 50\u00a0cc mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emit ten to thirty times the hydrocarbons and particulate emissions of the outdated Euro 3 automobile standards. In the same study, four-stroke mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emitted three to eight times the hydrocarbons and particulate emissions of the Euro 3 automobile standards. Approximate parity with automobiles was achieved with NOx emissions in these studies. Emissions performance was tested on a g/km basis and was unaffected by fuel economy. Currently in the United States, the EPA allows motorcycles, scooters, and mopeds with engine displacements less than to emit ten times the NOx and six times the CO as the median Tier II bin 5 automobile regulations. An additional air quality problem can also arise from the use of moped and scooter transportation over automobiles, as a higher density of motorized vehicles can be supported by existing transportation infrastructure.\nSafety.\nSafely riding a moped mostly requires the same considerations as safely riding a motorcycle. However the lower speeds reduce some dangers and increase others. The biggest danger is that other traffic may not notice the presence of a moped; bright clothes and reflective fittings help. Drivers may even see the moped, recognize it as harmless to them and simply forget it is there, pulling out of side-turnings into its path. Similarly, a car approaching a moped from behind will approach it more quickly than the driver expects, and the driver's attention may be more attuned to other automobile traffic rather than the moped, increasing the likelihood of an accident. This is a particular problem for mopeds used on high-speed roads where they may not be intended to travel.\nMopeds are often tuned for higher speeds, powers or engine displacements. For this to be legally allowed in most jurisdictions, such vehicles should be re-registered as motorcycles, and their driver's license requirements, taxes, insurance costs, and minimum driver age may be higher. A tuned vehicle, not designed for higher speeds, is not as safe as a purpose-designed motorcycle. A survey of Finnish high school vocational and gymnasium students found that 80% and 70% of their respective mopeds were tuned. Only 10% of trade school students had a moped that conformed to legislation. The average maximum speed was 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph), far higher than the legally allowable 45\u00a0km/h (28\u00a0mph). Another study reported that of school-age moped owners, 50% of boys and 15% of girls have an illegally tuned moped.\nSports moped.\nIn the United Kingdom during the 1970s, a high-performance derivation of the moped concept was developed, aimed at 16-year-olds. It was created in order to circumvent governmental legislation aimed at forcing young motorcycle riders off the road. These new laws, called the \"Sixteener Law\", were introduced by John Peyton, the then Conservative Party Minister for Transport in 1971. They forbade 16-year-olds from riding motorcycles of up to capacity as they had done before, and limited them to machines until they were 17. The law provoked motorcycle manufacturers to develop new class of motorcycle which were then called \"sports mopeds\" or, colloquially, \"sixteener specials\" and was subject to much criticism. The market for these was primarily young males.\nSports mopeds were ostensibly motorcycles, capable of doing more than in some cases, with bicycle-style pedals added to them which the law required were capable of propelling the vehicle. Models were produced by Japanese manufacturers Honda, Yamaha and Suzuki, and European companies such as Puch, Fantic, Gilera, Gitane and Garelli from 1972 onwards, the most famous of which was the Yamaha FS1-E. They included roadsters, enduro and motocrossers, cafe racers and choppers or scooters, and led to a boom interest in motorcycling similar to the early 1960 rocker period. The government responded again by bringing in even more restrictive legislation in 1977 which limited mopeds to a weight of and a top speed to . The move contributed to the decline of the UK motorcycle market.

Intuitively, a Lipschitz continuous function is limited in how fast it can change: there exists a real number such that, for every pair of points on the graph of this function, the absolute value of the slope of the line connecting them is not greater than this real number; the smallest such bound is called the \"Lipschitz constant\" of the function (and is related to the \"modulus of uniform continuity\"). For instance, every function that is defined on an interval and has a bounded first derivative is Lipschitz continuous.\nIn the theory of differential equations, Lipschitz continuity is the central condition of the Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the solution to an initial value problem. A special type of Lipschitz continuity, called contraction, is used in the Banach fixed-point theorem.\nWe have the following chain of strict inclusions for functions over a closed and bounded non-trivial interval of the real line:\n Continuously differentiable \u2282 Lipschitz continuous \u2282 formula_1-H\u00f6lder continuous,\nwhere formula_2. We also have\n Lipschitz continuous \u2282 absolutely continuous \u2282 uniformly continuous \u2282 continuous.\nDefinitions.\nGiven two metric spaces (\"X\", \"d\"\"X\") and (\"Y\", \"d\"\"Y\"), where \"d\"\"X\" denotes the metric on the set \"X\" and \"d\"\"Y\" is the metric on set \"Y\", a function \"f\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Y\" is called Lipschitz continuous if there exists a real constant \"K\" \u2265 0 such that, for all \"x\"1 and \"x\"2 in \"X\",\nformula_3\nAny such \"K\" is referred to as a Lipschitz constant for the function \"f,\" and \"f\" may also be referred to as K-Lipschitz. The smallest constant is sometimes called the (best) Lipschitz constant of \"f\" or the dilation of \"f\". If \"K\" = 1 the function is called a short map, and if 0 \u2264 \"K\" &lt; 1 and \"f\" maps a metric space to itself, the function is called a contraction.\nIn particular, a real-valued function \"f\" : R \u2192 R is called Lipschitz continuous if there exists a positive real constant K such that, for all real \"x\"1 and \"x\"2,\nformula_4\nIn this case, \"Y\" is the set of real numbers R with the standard metric \"d\"\"Y\"(\"y1\", \"y2\") = |\"y1\" \u2212 \"y2\"|, and \"X\" is a subset of R.\nIn general, the inequality is (trivially) satisfied if \"x\"1 = \"x\"2. Otherwise, one can equivalently define a function to be Lipschitz continuous if and only if there exists a constant \"K\" \u2265 0 such that, for all \"x\"1 \u2260 \"x\"2, \nformula_5\nFor real-valued functions of several real variables, this holds if and only if the absolute value of the slopes of all secant lines are bounded by \"K\". The set of lines of slope \"K\" passing through a point on the graph of the function forms a circular cone, and a function is Lipschitz if and only if the graph of the function everywhere lies completely outside of this cone (see figure).\nA function is called locally Lipschitz continuous if for every \"x\" in \"X\" there exists a neighborhood \"U\" of \"x\" such that \"f\" restricted to \"U\" is Lipschitz continuous. Equivalently, if \"X\" is a locally compact metric space, then \"f\" is locally Lipschitz if and only if it is Lipschitz continuous on every compact subset of \"X\". In spaces that are not locally compact, this is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.\nMore generally, a function \"f\" defined on \"X\" is said to be H\u00f6lder continuous or to satisfy a H\u00f6lder condition of order \u03b1 &gt; 0 on \"X\" if there exists a constant \"M\" \u2265 0 such that\nformula_6 \nfor all \"x\"1 and \"x\"2 in \"X\". Sometimes a H\u00f6lder condition of order \u03b1 is also called a uniform Lipschitz condition of order \u03b1 &gt; 0.\nFor a real number \"K\" \u2265 1, if\nformula_7\nthen \"f\" is called K\"-bilipschitz (also written K\"-bi-Lipschitz). We say \"f\" is bilipschitz or bi-Lipschitz to mean there exists such a \"K\". A bilipschitz mapping is injective, and is in fact a homeomorphism onto its image. A bilipschitz function is the same thing as an injective Lipschitz function whose inverse function is also Lipschitz.\nformula_17 \nwhere \"k\" is a Lipschitz constant for \"f\" on \"U\".\nLipschitz manifolds.\nA Lipschitz structure on a topological manifold is defined using an atlas of charts whose transition maps are bilipschitz; this is possible because bilipschitz maps form a pseudogroup. Such a structure allows one to define locally Lipschitz maps between such manifolds, similarly to how one defines smooth maps between smooth manifolds: if M and N are Lipschitz manifolds, then a function formula_18 is locally Lipschitz if and only if for every pair of coordinate charts formula_19 and formula_20, where U and V are open sets in the corresponding Euclidean spaces, the composition\nformula_21\nis locally Lipschitz. This definition does not rely on defining a metric on M or N.\nThis structure is intermediate between that of a piecewise-linear manifold and a topological manifold: a PL structure gives rise to a unique Lipschitz structure. While Lipschitz manifolds are closely related to topological manifolds, Rademacher's theorem allows one to do analysis, yielding various applications.\nOne-sided Lipschitz.\nLet \"F\"(\"x\") be an upper semi-continuous function of \"x\", and that \"F\"(\"x\") is a closed, convex set for all \"x\". Then \"F\" is one-sided Lipschitz if\nformula_22 \nfor some \"C\" and for all \"x\"1 and \"x\"2.\nIt is possible that the function \"F\" could have a very large Lipschitz constant but a moderately sized, or even negative, one-sided Lipschitz constant. For example, the function\nformula_23\nhas Lipschitz constant \"K\" = 50 and a one-sided Lipschitz constant \"C\" = 0. An example which is one-sided Lipschitz but not Lipschitz continuous is \"F\"(\"x\") = \"e\"\u2212\"x\", with \"C\" = 0.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "51734", "revid": "84755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51734", "title": "Conveyor belt", "text": "Close-loop rubber band used in motorized conveying system\nA conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to a belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with a closed loop of carrying medium\u2014the conveyor belt\u2014that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward. The powered pulley is called the drive pulley, while the unpowered pulley is called the idler pulley. There are two main industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, coal, ore, sand, overburden and more.\nOverview.\nConveyors are durable and reliable components used in automated distribution and warehousing, as well as manufacturing and production facilities. In combination with computer-controlled pallet handling equipment this allows for more efficient retail, wholesale, and manufacturing distribution. It is considered a labor-saving system that allows large volumes to move rapidly through a process, allowing companies to ship or receive higher volumes with smaller storage space and with labor expense.\nBelt conveyors are the most commonly used powered conveyors because they are the most versatile and the least expensive. Products are conveyed directly on the belt so both regular and irregular shaped objects, large or small, light and heavy, can be transported successfully. Belt conveyors are also manufactured with curved sections that use tapered rollers and curved belting to convey products around a corner. These conveyor systems are commonly used in postal sorting offices and airport baggage handling systems.\nBelt conveyors are generally fairly similar in construction consisting of a metal frame with rollers at either end of a flat metal bed. Rubber conveyor belts are commonly used to convey items with irregular bottom surfaces, small items that would fall in between rollers (e.g. a sushi conveyor bar), or bags of product that would sag between rollers. The belt is looped around each of the rollers and when one of the rollers is powered (by an electrical motor) the belting slides across the solid metal frame bed, moving the product. In heavy use applications, the beds in which the belting is pulled over are replaced with rollers. The rollers allow weight to be conveyed as they reduce the amount of friction generated from the heavier loading on the belting. The exception to the standard belt conveyor construction is the sandwich belt conveyor. The sandwich belt conveyor uses two conveyor belts, instead of one. These two conventional conveyor belts are positioned face to face, to firmly contain the items being carried in a \"sandwich-like\" hold.\nBelt conveyors can be used to transport products in a straight line or through changes in elevation or direction. For conveying bulk materials, over gentle slopes or gentle curvatures, a troughed belt conveyor is used. The trough of the belt ensures that the flowable material is contained within the edges of the belt. The trough is achieved by keeping the idler rollers in an angle to the horizontal at the sides of the idler frame. A pipe conveyor is used for material travel paths that require sharper bends and inclines up to 35 degrees. A pipe conveyor features the edges of the belt being rolled together to form a circular section like a pipe. Like a troughed belt conveyor, a pipe conveyor also uses idler rollers. However, in this case, the idler frame completely surrounds the conveyor belt helping it to retain the pipe section while pushing it forward. In the case of travel paths requiring high angles and snake-like curvatures, a sandwich belt is used. The sandwich belt design enables materials carried to travel along a path of high inclines up to 90-degree angles, enabling a vertical path as opposed to a horizontal one. This transport option is also powered by idlers.\nOther important components of the belt conveying system apart from the pulleys and idler rollers include the drive arrangement of reducer gear boxes, drive motors, and associated couplings. scrapers to clean the belt, chutes for controlling the discharge direction, skirts for containing the discharge on the receiving belt, take up assembly for \"tensioning\" the belt, safety switches for personnel safety and technological structures like stringer, short post, drive frames, pulley frames make up the balance items to complete the belt conveying system. In certain applications, belt conveyors can also be used for static accumulation or cartons.\nHistory.\nPrimitive conveyor belts have been in use since the 19th century. In 1868, an English shipwright Joseph Thomas Parlour from Pimlico patented a grain elevator with a conveyor belt while Illinoisan Charles Denton of Ames Plow Co. patented a reaper with a belt \"conveyer\". By the 1880s conveyor belts were used in American elevators, sugarcane mills and sawmills, as well as British maltings.\nIn 1892, Thomas Robins began a series of inventions which led to the development of a conveyor belt used for carrying coal, ores and other products. In 1901, Sandvik invented and started the production of steel conveyor belts. In 1905, Richard Sutcliffe invented the first conveyor belts for use in coal mines, which revolutionized the mining industry. In 1913, Henry Ford introduced conveyor-belt assembly lines at Ford Motor Company's Highland Park, Michigan factory.\nIn 1972, the French society REI created in New Caledonia the longest straight-belt conveyor in the world in that moment, at a length of . Hyacynthe Marcel Bocchetti was the concept designer. The longest conveyor belt is that of the Bou Craa phosphate mine in Western Sahara (1973, 98\u00a0km in 11 sections). The longest single-span conveyor belt is at the Boddington bauxite mine in Western Australia (31\u00a0km).\nIn 1957, the B. F. Goodrich Company patented a M\u00f6bius strip conveyor belt, that it went on to produce as the \"Turnover Conveyor Belt System\". Incorporating a half-twist, it had the advantage over conventional belts of a longer life because it could expose all of its surface area to wear and tear. Such M\u00f6bius strip belts are no longer manufactured because untwisted modern belts can be made more durable by constructing them from several layers of different materials. In 1970, Intralox, a Louisiana-based company, registered the first patent for all plastic, modular belting.\nStructure.\nThe belt consists of one or more layers of material. It is common for belts to have three layers: a top cover, a carcass and a bottom cover. The purpose of the carcass is to provide linear strength and shape. The carcass is often a woven or metal fabric having a warp &amp; weft. The warp refers to longitudinal cords whose characteristics of resistance and elasticity define the running properties of the belt. The weft represents the whole set of transversal cables allowing to the belt specific resistance against cuts, tears and impacts and at the same time high flexibility. The most common carcass materials are steel, polyester, nylon, cotton and aramid (class of heat-resistant and strong synthetic fibers, with Twaron or Kevlar as brand names). The covers are usually various rubber or plastic compounds specified by use of the belt.\nSteel conveyor belts are used when high strength class is required. For example, the highest strength class conveyor belt installed is made of steel cords. This conveyor belt has a strength class of and it operates at Chuquicamata mine, in Chile. Polyester, nylon and cotton are popular with low strength classes. Aramid is used in the range . The advantages of using aramid are energy savings, enhanced lifetimes and improved productivity. As an example, a , underground belt installed at Baodian Coal Mine, part of in Yanzhou Coal Mining Company, China, was reported to provide energy savings of over 15%. Whilst Shenhua Group, has installed several aramid conveyor belts, including a belt with a length of .\nApplications.\nToday there are different types of conveyor belts that have been created for conveying different kinds of material available in PVC and rubber materials. \nMaterial flowing over the belt may be weighed in transit using a beltweigher. Belts with regularly spaced partitions, known as \"elevator belts\", are used for transporting loose materials up steep inclines. Belt Conveyors are used in self-unloading bulk freighters and in live bottom trucks. Belt conveyor technology is also used in conveyor transport such as moving sidewalks or escalators, as well as on many manufacturing assembly lines. Stores often have conveyor belts at the check-out counter to move shopping items, and may use checkout dividers in this process. Ski areas also use conveyor belts to transport skiers up the hill. Industrial and manufacturing applications for belt conveyors include package handling, trough belt conveyors, trash handling, bag handling, coding conveyors, and more. Integration of Human-Machine Interface(HMI) to operate the conveyor system is in the developing stages and will prove to be an efficient innovation.\nLong belt conveyors.\nThe longest belt conveyor system in the world is in Western Sahara. It was built in 1972 by Friedrich Krupp GmbH (now thyssenkrupp) and is long, from the phosphate mines of Bu Craa to the coast south of El-Aaiun.\nThe longest conveyor system in an airport is the Dubai International Airport baggage handling system at . It was installed by Siemens and commissioned in 2008, and has a combination of traditional belt conveyors and tray conveyors.\nBoddington Bauxite Mine in Western Australia is officially recognized as having the world's longest single flight conveyor. Single flight means the load is not transferred, it is a single continuous system for the entire length. This conveyor is a cable belt conveyor system with a conveyor feeding a conveyor. Cable belt conveyors are a variation on the more conventional idler belt system. Instead of running on top of idlers, cable belt conveyors are supported by two endless steel cables (steel wire rope) which are in turn supported by idler pulley wheels. This system feeds bauxite through the difficult terrain of the Darling Ranges to the Worsley Alumina refinery.\nThe second longest single trough belt conveyor is the Impumelelo conveyor near Secunda, South Africa. It was designed by Conveyor Dynamics, Inc. based in Bellingham, Washington, USA and constructed by ELB Engineering based in Johannesburg South Africa. The conveyor transports coal from a mine to a refinery that converts the coal to diesel fuel. The third longest trough belt conveyor in the world is the Curragh conveyor near Westfarmers, QLD, Australia. Conveyor Dynamics, Inc. supplied the basic engineering, control system and commissioning. Detail engineering and Construction was completed by Laing O'Rourke.\nThe longest single-belt international conveyor runs from Meghalaya in India to a cement factory at Chhatak Bangladesh. It is about long and conveys limestone and shale at , from the quarry in India to the cement factory ( long in India and long in Bangladesh). The conveyor was engineered by AUMUND France and Larsen &amp; Toubro. The conveyor is actuated by three synchronized drive units for a total power of about 1.8\u00a0MW supplied by ABB (two drives at the head end in Bangladesh and one drive at the tail end in India). The conveyor belt was manufactured in lengths on the Indian side and lengths on the Bangladesh side. The idlers, or rollers, of the system are unique in that they are designed to accommodate both horizontal and vertical curves along the terrain. Dedicated vehicles were designed for the maintenance of the conveyor, which is always at a minimum height of above the ground to avoid being flooded during monsoon periods.\nBelt conveyor safety system.\nConveyors used in industrial settings include tripping mechanisms such as trip cords along the length of the conveyor. This allows for workers to immediately shut down the conveyor when a problem arises. Warning alarms are included to notify employees that a conveyor is about to turn on. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued regulations for conveyor safety, as OSHA 1926.555.\nSome other systems used to safeguard the conveyor are belt sway switches, speed switches, belt rip switch, and emergency stops. The belt sway switch will stop the conveyor if the belt starts losing its alignment along the structure. The speed switch will stop the belt if the switch is not registering that the belt is running at the required speed. The belt rip switch will stop the belt when there is a cut, or a flap indicating that the belt is in danger of further damage. An emergency stop may be located on the conveyor control box in case of trip chord malfunctions.\nReuse.\nWorn rubber or elastomer belts can be reused in many ways. Applications for the material include toolbox liners, anti-fatigue floor mats, dock bumpers, landscale edging, livestock fencing, and water diversion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The duration of a dark moon varies between 1.5 and 3.5 days, depending on its ecliptic latitude. In current astronomical usage, the new moon occurs in the middle of this dark period, when the Moon and Sun are in conjunction. This definition has entered popular usage, so that calendars will typically indicate the date of the \"new moon\" rather than the \"dark moon\".\nDark moon as the 30th division.\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines the new moon as \"the first visible crescent of the Moon, after conjunction with the Sun\". \"Dark moon\" is a term used for a waning crescent moon. When the Moon's orbit is divided into 30 segments, as the ancient Greeks did in the time of Homer, the Babylonians did, and the Indians still do today (calling them \"tithi\"), the last phase is called the \"dark moon\". In Greek, it was called the \"old moon\" and associated with Hecate. In India, it is called Amavasya and associated with Kali. Both of these goddesses have a dark connotation, hence the term dark moon.\nIn Babylonian, Greek, and Indian culture, the dark moon occurs within the 12\u00b0 of angular distance between the Moon and the Sun before conjunction (a type of syzygy). The new moon occurs within the 12\u00b0 after syzygy. This 12\u00b0 arc is called \"uma\" by the Babylonians and \"tithi\" by the Indians.\nThe Moon takes a mean duration of 23 hours and 37 minutes to cover this length, but this period can vary from 21 to 26 hours because of the Moon's orbital anomaly. This means that the \"dark moon\" actually lasts approximately 23 hours and 37 minutes and includes any time marked as \"new moon\" on a lunar calendar, and not 1.5 to 3.5 days as stated earlier.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Unlike semi-rigid and rigid airships (e.g. Zeppelins), blimps rely on the pressure of their lifting gas (usually helium, rather than flammable hydrogen) and the strength of the envelope to maintain their shape. Blimps are known for their use in advertising, surveillance, and observation due to their maneuverability, slow speeds and steady flight capabilities.\nPrinciple.\nSince blimps keep their shape with internal overpressure, typically the only solid parts are the passenger car (gondola) and the tail fins. A non-rigid airship that uses heated air instead of a light gas (such as helium) as a lifting medium is called a hot-air airship (sometimes there are battens near the bow, which assist with higher forces there from a mooring attachment or from the greater aerodynamic pressures there).\nVolume changes of the lifting gas due to temperature changes or to changes of altitude are compensated for by pumping air into internal ballonets (air bags) to maintain the overpressure. Without sufficient overpressure, the blimp loses its ability to be steered and is slowed due to increased drag and distortion. The propeller air stream can be used to inflate the ballonets and so the hull. In some models, such as the Skyship 600, differential ballonet inflation can provide a measure of pitch trim control.\nThe engines driving the propellers are usually directly attached to the gondola, and in some models are partly steerable.\nBlimps are the most commonly built airships because they are relatively easy to build and easy to transport once deflated. However, because of their unstable hull, their size is limited. A blimp with too long a hull may kink in the middle when the overpressure is insufficient or when maneuvered too fast (this has also happened with semi-rigid airships with weak keels). This led to the development of semi-rigids and rigid airships.\nModern blimps are launched somewhat heavier than air (overweight), in contrast to historic blimps. The missing lift is provided by lifting the nose and using engine power, or by angling the engine thrust. Some types also use steerable propellers or ducted fans. Operating in a state heavier than air avoids the need to dump ballast at lift-off and also avoids the need to lose costly helium lifting gas on landing (most of the Zeppelins achieved lift with very inexpensive hydrogen, which could be vented without concern to decrease altitude).\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the word \"blimp\" has been the subject of some confusion. Lennart Ege notes two possible derivations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA 1943 etymology, published in \"The New York Times\", supports a British origin during the First World War when the British were experimenting with lighter-than-air craft. The initial non-rigid aircraft was called the A-limp; and a second version called the B-limp was deemed more satisfactory.\nYet a third derivation is given by Barnes and James in \"Shorts Aircraft since 1900\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn February 1915 the need for anti-submarine patrol airships became urgent, and the Submarine Scout type was quickly improvised by hanging an obsolete B.E.2c fuselage from a spare Willows envelope; this was done by the R.N.A.S. at Kingsnorth, and on seeing the result for the first time, Horace Short, already noted for his very apt and original vocabulary, named it \"Blimp\", adding, \"What else would you call it?\"\nDr. A. D. Topping researched the origins of the word and concluded that the British had never had a \"Type\u00a0B, limp\" designation, and that Cunningham's coinage appeared to be the correct explanation.\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" notes its use in print in 1916: \"Visited the Blimps\u00a0... this afternoon at Capel\". In 1918, the \"Illustrated London News\" said that it was \"an onomatop\u0153ic name invented by that genius for apposite nomenclature, the late Horace Short\".\nUse.\nThe B-class blimps were patrol airships operated by the United States Navy during and shortly after World War I. The Navy learned a great deal from the DN-1 fiasco. The result was the very successful B-type airships. Dr. Jerome Hunsaker was asked to develop a theory of airship design. This was followed by then-Lieutenant John H. Towers, USN, returning from Europe having inspected British designs, and the U.S. Navy subsequently sought bids for 16 blimps from American manufacturers. On 4 February 1917 the Secretary of the Navy directed that 16 nonrigid airships of Class B be procured. Ultimately Goodyear built 9 envelopes, Goodrich built five and Curtiss built the gondolas for all of those 14 ships. Connecticut Aircraft contracted with U.S. Rubber for its two envelopes and with Pigeon Fraser for its gondolas. The Curtiss-built gondolas were modified JN-4 fuselages and were powered by OX-5 engines. The Connecticut Aircraft blimps were powered by Hall-Scott engines.\nIn 1930, a former German airship officer, Captain Anton Heinen, working in the US for the US Navy on its dirigible fleet, attempted to design and build a four-place blimp called the \"family air yacht\" for private fliers which the inventor claimed would be priced below $10,000 and easier to fly than a fixed-wing aircraft if placed in production. It was unsuccessful.\nIn 2021, \"Reader's Digest\" said that \"consensus is that there are about 25 blimps still in existence and only about half of them are still in use for advertising purposes\". The Airsign Airship Group is the owner and operator of 8 of these active ships, including the Hood Blimp, DirecTV blimp, and the MetLife blimp.\nSurveillance blimp.\nThis blimp is a type of airborne early warning and control aircraft, typically as the active part of a system which includes a mooring platform, communications and information processing. Example systems include the U.S. JLENS and Israeli Aeronautics Defense Skystar 300.\nSurveillance blimps known as aerostats have been used extensively in the Middle East by the United States military, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.\nExamples of non-rigid airships.\nManufacturers in many countries have built blimps in many designs.

The drawing table used to be a frequent companion to a pedestal desk in a study or private library, during the pre-industrial and early industrial era.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, draftsmanship gradually became a specialized trade and drawing tables slowly moved out of the libraries and offices of most gentlemen. They became more utilitarian and were built of steel and plastic instead of fine woods and brass.\nMore recently, engineers and draftsmen use the drawing board for making and modifying drawings on paper with ink or pencil. Different drawing instruments (set square, protractor, etc.) are used on it to draw parallel, perpendicular or oblique lines. There are instruments for drawing circles, arcs, other curves and symbols too (compass, French curve, stencil, etc.). However, with the gradual introduction of computer aided drafting and design (CADD or CAD) in the last decades of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century, the drawing board is becoming less common.\nA drawing table is also sometimes called a mechanical desk because, for several centuries, most mechanical desks were drawing tables. Unlike the gadgety mechanical desks of the second part of the 18th century, however, the mechanical parts of drawing tables were usually limited to notches, ratchets, and perhaps a few simple gears, or levers or cogs to elevate and incline the working surface.\nVery often a drawing table could look like a writing table or even a pedestal desk when the working surface was set at the horizontal and the height adjusted to 29\u00a0inches, in order to use it as a \"normal\" desk. The only giveaway was usually a lip on one of the sides of the desktop. This lip or edge stopped paper or books from sliding when the surface was given an angle. It was also sometimes used to hold writing implements. When the working surface was extended at its full height, a drawing table could be used as a standing desk.\nMany reproductions have been made and are still being produced of drawing tables, copying the period styles they were originally made in during the 18th and 19th centuries.\nHistory.\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, drawing paper was dampened and then its edges glued to the drawing board. After drying the paper would be flat and smooth. The completed drawing was then cut free. Paper could also be secured to the drawing board with drawing pins or even C-clamps. More recent practice is to use self-adhesive drafting tape to secure paper to the board, including the sophisticated use of individualized adhesive dots from a dispensing roll. Some drawing boards are magnetized, allowing paper to be held down by long steel strips. Boards used for overlay drafting or animation may include registration pins or peg bars to ensure alignment of multiple layers of drawing media.\nContemporary drafting tables.\nDespite the prevalence of computer aided drafting, many older architects and even some structural designers still rely on paper and pencil graphics produced on a drafting table.\nModern drafting tables typically rely on a steel frame. Steel provides as much strength as the old oak drafting table frames and much easier portability. Typically the drafting board surface is a thick sheet of compressed fibreboard with sheets of Formica laminated to all its surfaces. The drafting board surface is usually secured to the frame by screws which can easily be removed for drafting table transportation.\nThe steel frame allows mechanical linkages to be installed that control both the height and angle of the drafting board surface. Typically, a single foot pedal is used to control a clutch which clamps the board in the desired position. A heavy counterweight full of lead shot is installed in the steel linkage so that if the pedal is accidentally released, the drafting board will not spring into the upright position and injure the user. Drafting table linkages and clutches have to be maintained to ensure that this safety mechanism counterbalances the weight of the table surface.\nThe drafting table surface is usually covered with a thin vinyl sheet called a board cover. This provides an optimum surface for pen and pencil drafting. It allows compasses and dividers to be used without damaging the wooden surface of the board. A board cover must be frequently cleaned to prevent graphite buildup from making new drawings dirty. At the bottom edge of the table, a single strip of aluminum or steel may serve as a place to rest drafting pencils. More purpose-built trays are also used which hold pencils even while the board is being adjusted.\nVarious types of drafting machine may be attached to the board surface to assist the draftsperson or artist. Parallel rules often span the entire width of the board and are so named because they remain parallel to the top edge of the board as they are moved up and down. Drafting machines use pre-calibrated scales and built in protractors to allow accurate drawing measurement.\nSome drafting tables incorporate electric motors to provide the up and down and angle adjustment of the drafting table surface. These tables are at least as heavy as the original oak and brass drafting tables and so sacrifice portability for the convenience of push button table adjustment.\nModern-day idiom.\nThe expression \"back to the drawing board\" is used when a plan or course of action needs to be changed, often drastically; usually due to a very unsuccessful result; e.g., \"The battle plan, the result of months of conferences, failed because the enemy retreated too far back. It was back to the drawing board for the army captains.\"\nThe phrase was coined in the caption to a Peter Arno cartoon of \"The New Yorker\" of March 1, 1941.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "51744", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51744", "title": "American Pie (song)", "text": "1971 single by Don McLean\n\"American Pie\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Don McLean. Recorded and released in 1971 on the album of the same name, the single was the number-one US hit for four weeks in 1972 starting January 15 after just eight weeks on the US \"Billboard\" charts (where it entered at number 69). The song also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. In the United Kingdom, the single reached number 2, where it stayed for three weeks on its original 1971 release, and a reissue in 1991 reached No.\u00a012. The song was listed as the No.\u00a05 song on the RIAA project Songs of the Century. A truncated version of the song was covered by Madonna in 2000 and reached No. 1 in at least 15 countries, including the UK, Canada, and Australia. At 8 minutes and 42 seconds, McLean's combined version is the sixth longest song to enter the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (at the time of release it was the longest). The song also held the record for almost 50 years for being the longest song to reach number one before Taylor Swift's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" broke the record in 2021. Due to its exceptional length, it was initially released as a two-sided 7-inch single. \"American Pie\" has been described as \"one of the most successful and debated songs of the 20th century\".\nThe repeated phrase \"the day the music died\" refers to a plane crash in 1959 that killed early rock and roll stars Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens, ending the era of early rock and roll; this became the popular nickname for that crash. The theme of the song goes beyond mourning McLean's childhood music heroes, reflecting the deep cultural changes and profound disillusion and loss of innocence of his generation \u2013 the early rock and roll generation \u2013 that took place between the 1959 plane crash and either late 1969 or late 1970. The meaning of the other lyrics, which cryptically allude to many of the jarring events and social changes experienced during that period, has been debated for decades. McLean repeatedly declined to explain the symbolism behind the many characters and events mentioned; he eventually released his songwriting notes to accompany the original manuscript when it was sold in 2015, explaining many of these. McLean further elaborated on the lyrical meaning in a 2022 documentary celebrating the song's 50th anniversary, in which he stated the song was driven by impressionism, and debunked some of the more widely speculated symbols.\nIn 2017, McLean's original recording was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". To mark the 50th anniversary of the song, McLean performed a 35-date tour through Europe, starting in Wales and ending in Austria, in 2022.\nBackground.\nDon McLean drew inspiration for the song from his childhood experience delivering newspapers during the time of the plane crash that killed early rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I first found out about the plane crash because I was a 13-year-old newspaper delivery boy in New Rochelle, New York, and I was carrying the bundle of the local \"Standard-Star\" papers that were bound in twine, and when I cut it open with a knife, there it was on the front page.\u2014\u200a\nMcLean reportedly wrote \"American Pie\" in Saratoga Springs, New York, at Caff\u00e8 Lena, but a 2011 \"New York Times\" article quotes McLean as disputing this claim. Some employees at Caff\u00e8 Lena claim that he started writing the song there, and then continued to write the song in both Cold Spring, New York, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. McLean claims that the song was only written in Cold Spring and Philadelphia. Tin &amp; Lint, a bar on Caroline Street in Saratoga Springs, claims the song was written there, and a plaque marks the table. While a 2022 documentary on the history of the song claims Saint Joseph's University as where the song was first performed, McLean insists that the song made its debut in Philadelphia at Temple University when he opened for Laura Nyro on March 14, 1971.\nThe song was produced by Ed Freeman and recorded with a few session musicians. Freeman did not want McLean to play rhythm guitar on the song but eventually relented. McLean and the session musicians rehearsed for two weeks but failed to get the song right. At the last minute, the pianist Paul Griffin was added, which is when the tune came together. McLean used a 1969 or 1970 Martin D-28 guitar to provide the basic chords throughout \"American Pie\".\nThe song debuted on the album \"American Pie\" in October 1971 and was released as a single in November. The song's eight-and-a-half-minute length meant that it could not fit entirely on one side of the 45 RPM record, so United Artists had the first taking up the A-side of the record and the final the B-side. Radio stations initially played the A-side of the song only, but soon switched to the full album version to satisfy their audiences.\nUpon the single release, \"Cash Box\" called it \"folk-rock's most ambitious and successful epic endeavor since 'Alice's Restaurant.'\" \"Record World\" called it a \"monumental accomplishment of lyric writing\".\nInterpretations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe sense of disillusion and loss that the song transmits isn't just about deaths in the world of music, but also about a generation that could no longer believe in the utopian dreams of the 1950s... According to McLean, the song represents a shift from the na\u00efve and innocent '50s to the darker decade of the '60s\nAlva Yaffe, Musicholics, \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDon called his song a complicated parable, open to different interpretations. \"People ask me if I left the lyrics open to ambiguity. Of course I did. I wanted to make a whole series of complex statements. The lyrics had to do with the state of society at the time.\"\nSuper seventies, \nThe song has nostalgic themes, stretching from the late 1950s until late 1969 or 1970. Except to acknowledge that he first learned about Buddy Holly's death on February 3, 1959 \u2013 McLean was age 13 \u2013 when he was folding newspapers for his paper route on the morning of February 4, 1959 (hence the line \"February made me shiver/with every paper I'd deliver\"), McLean has generally avoided responding to direct questions about the song's lyrics; he has said: \"They're beyond analysis. They're poetry.\" He also stated in an editorial published in 2009, on the 50th anniversary of the crash that killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson (all of whom are alluded to in the final verse in a comparison with the Christian Holy Trinity), that writing the first verse of the song exorcised his long-running grief over Holly's death and that he considers the song to be \"a big song... that summed up the world known as America\". McLean dedicated the \"American Pie\" album to Holly.\nSome commentators have identified the song as outlining the darkening of cultural mood, as over time the cultural vanguard passed from Pete Seeger and Joan Baez (the \"King and Queen\" of folk music), then from Elvis Presley (known as \"the King\" of Rock and Roll), to Bob Dylan (\"the Jester\" \u2013 who wore a jacket similar to that worn by cultural icon James Dean, was known as \"the voice of his generation\" (\"a voice that came from you and me\"), and whose motorcycle accident (\"in a cast\") left him in reclusion for many years, recording in studios rather than touring (\"on the sidelines\"), to the Beatles (John Lennon, punned with Vladimir Lenin, and \"the Quartet\" \u2013 although McLean has stated the Quartet is a reference to other people), to the Byrds (who wrote one of the first psychedelic rock songs, \"Eight Miles High\", and then \"fell fast\" \u2013 the song was banned, band member Gene Clark entered rehabilitation, known colloquially as a \"fallout shelter\", and shortly after, the group declined as it lost members, changed genres, and alienated fans), to the Rolling Stones (who released \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\" and the singles \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" and \"Sympathy for the Devil\" (\"Jack Flash\", \"Satan\", \"The Devil\"), and used the Hells Angels \u2013 \"Angels born in Hell\" \u2013 as Altamont event security, with fatal consequences, bringing the 1960s to a violent end), and to Janis Joplin (the \"girl who sang the blues\" but just \"turned away\" \u2013 she died of a heroin overdose the following year).\nIt has also been speculated that the song contains numerous references to post-World War II American political events, such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy (known casually as \"Jack\"), First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy (\"his widowed bride\"), and subsequent killing of his assassin (whose courtroom trial obviously ended as a result [\"adjourned\"]), the Cuban Missile Crisis (\"Jack be nimble, Jack be quick\"), the murders of civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, and elements of culture such as sock hops (\"kicking off shoes\" to dance, preventing damage to the varnished floor), cruising with a pickup truck, the rise of the political protest song (\"a voice that came from you and me\"), drugs and the counterculture, the Manson Family and the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders in the \"summer swelter\" of 1969 (the Beatles' song \"Helter Skelter\") and much more.\nApparent allusions to notable 50s songs include Don Cornell's \"The Bible Tells Me So\" (\"If the Bible tells you so?\"), Marty Robbins' \"A White Sport Coat\", the lonely teenager (\"With a pink carnation\") mirroring Robbins' narrator who is rejected in favor of another man for the prom, and The Monotones' \"The Book of Love\" (\"Did you write the book of love\").\nMany additional and alternative interpretations have also been proposed.\nFor example, Bob Dylan's first performance in Great Britain was also at a pub called \"The King and Queen\", and he also appeared more literally \"on the sidelines in a (the) cast\" \u2013 as one of many stars at the back far right of the cover art of the Beatles' album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (\"the Sergeants played a marching tune\").\nThe song title itself is a reference to apple pie, an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its signature comfort foods, as seen in the popular expression \"As American as apple pie\". By the twentieth century, this had become a symbol of American prosperity and national pride.\nThe original United Artists Records inner sleeve featured a free verse poem written by McLean about William Boyd, also known as Hopalong Cassidy, along with a picture of Boyd in full Hopalong regalia. Its inclusion in the album was interpreted to represent a sense of loss of a simplistic type of American culture as symbolized by Hopalong Cassidy and by extension black and white television as a whole.\nMike Mills of R.E.M. reflected: \"'American Pie' just made perfect sense to me as a song and that's what impressed me the most. I could say to people this is how to write songs. When you've written at least three songs that can be considered classic that is a very high batting average and if one of those songs happens to be something that a great many people think is one of the greatest songs ever written you've not only hit the top of the mountain but you've stayed high on the mountain for a long time.\"\nMcLean's responses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor McLean, the song is a blueprint of his mind at the time and a homage to his musical influences, but also a roadmap for future students of history:\n\"If it starts young people thinking about Buddy Holly, about rock 'n' roll and that music, and then it teaches them maybe about what else happened in the country, maybe look at a little history, maybe ask why John Kennedy was shot and who did it, maybe ask why all our leaders were shot in the 1960s and who did it, maybe start to look at war and the stupidity of it \u2014 if that can happen, then the song really is serving a wonderful purpose and a positive purpose.\"\nMark Kennedy, \"Don McLean looks back at his masterpiece, 'American Pie'\" (2022)\u00a0\nWhen asked what \"American Pie\" meant, McLean jokingly replied, \"It means I don't ever have to work again if I don't want to.\" Later, he stated, \"You will find many interpretations of my lyrics but none of them by me... Sorry to leave you all on your own like this but long ago I realized that songwriters should make their statements and move on, maintaining a dignified silence.\" He also commented on the popularity of his music, \"I didn't write songs that were just catchy, but with a point of view, or songs about the environment.\"\nIn February 2015, however, McLean announced he would reveal the meaning of the lyrics to the song when the original manuscript went for auction in New York City, in April 2015. The lyrics and notes were auctioned on April 7, 2015, and sold for $1.2\u00a0million. In the sale catalogue notes, McLean revealed the meaning in the song's lyrics: \"Basically in 'American Pie' things are heading in the wrong direction. It [life] is becoming less idyllic. I don't know whether you consider that wrong or right but it is a morality song in a sense.\" The catalogue confirmed that the song climaxes with a description of the killing of Meredith Hunter at the Altamont Free Concert, ten years after the plane crash that killed Holly, Valens, and Richardson, and did acknowledge that some of the more well-known symbols in the song were inspired by figures such as Elvis Presley (\"the king\") and Bob Dylan (\"the jester\").\nIn 2017, Bob Dylan was asked about how he was referenced in the song. \"A jester? Sure, the jester writes songs like 'Masters of War', 'A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall', 'It's Alright, Ma' \u2013 some jester. I have to think he's talking about somebody else. Ask him.\"\nIn 2022, the documentary \"The Day the Music Died: The Story of Don McLean's American Pie\", produced by Spencer Proffer, was released on the Paramount+ video on-demand service. Proffer said that he told McLean: \"It's time for you to reveal what 50 years of journalists have wanted to know.\" McLean stated that he \"needed a big song about America\", and the first verse and melody (\"A long, long time ago...\") seemed to just come to mind.\nMcLean also answered some of the long-standing questions on the song's lyrics, although not all. He revealed that Presley was not the king referenced in the song, Joplin was not the \"girl who sang the blues\", and Dylan was not the jester, although he is open to other interpretations. He explained that the \"marching band\" refers to the military\u2013industrial complex, \"sweet perfume\" refers to tear gas, and Los Angeles is the \"coast\" that the Trinity head to (\"caught the last train for the coast\"), commenting \"even God has been corrupted\". He also said that the line \"This'll be the day that I die\" originated from the John Wayne film \"The Searchers\" (which inspired Buddy Holly's song \"That'll Be the Day\"), and the chorus's line \"Bye-bye, Miss American Pie\" was inspired by a song by Pete Seeger, \"Bye Bye, My Roseanna\". McLean had originally intended to use \"Miss American apple pie\", but \"apple\" was dropped.\nOn the whole, McLean stated that the lyrics were meant to be impressionist, and that many of the lyrics, only a portion of which were included in the finished recording, were completely fictional with no basis in real-life events.\nPersonnel.\nCredits from Richard Buskin, except where noted.\nMusicians.\nThe final chorus features multi-tracked backing vocals, credited in the album's sleeve notes to the \"West Forty Fourth Street Rhythm and Noise Choir\". Although the individual choristers have never been publicly named, producer Ed Freeman has claimed that the choir included Pete Seeger, James Taylor, Livingston Taylor and Carly Simon.\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nParodies, revisions, and uses.\nIn 1999, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic wrote and recorded a parody of \"American Pie\". Titled \"The Saga Begins\", the song recounts the plot of \"\" from Obi-Wan Kenobi's point of view. While McLean gave permission for the parody, he did not make a cameo appearance in its video, despite popular rumor. McLean himself praised the parody, even admitting to almost singing Yankovic's lyrics during his own live performances because his children played the song so often. An unrelated comedy film franchise by Universal Pictures, who secured the rights to McLean's title, also debuted in 1999.\n\"American Pie\" was the last song to be played on Virgin Radio before it was rebranded as Absolute Radio in 2008. It was also the last song played on BFBS Malta in 1979.\nIn 2012, the City of Grand Rapids, Michigan, created a lip dub video to \"American Pie\" in response to a \"Newsweek\" article that stated the city was \"dying\". (Due to licensing issues, the version used in the video was not the original, but rather a later-recorded live version.) The video was hailed as a fantastic performance by many, including film critic Roger Ebert, who said it was \"the greatest music video ever made\".\nIn 2013, Harmonix announced that \"American Pie\" would be the final downloadable track made available for the \"Rock Band\" series of music video games. This was the case until \"Rock Band 4\" was released in 2015, reviving the series' downloadable content.\nOn March 14, 2015, the National Museum of Mathematics announced that one of two winners of its songwriting contest was \"American Pi\" by mathematics education professor Dr. Lawrence M. Lesser. The contest was in honor of \"Pi Day of the Century\" because \"3/14/15\" would be the only day in the 21st-century showing the first five digits of \u03c0 (pi).\nIn 2015, John Mayer covered \"American Pie\" live on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", at the request of the show's eponymous host.\nIn 2021, McLean released a re-recording of \"American Pie\" featuring lead vocals by country a cappella group Home Free.\nIn 2023, during his visit to the United States, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol sang the song at a state dinner. Afterwards Don McLean humorously offered to perform a duet version with Suk-yeol.\nIn the 2006 film \"Love Comes to the Executioner\", Jeremy Renner sings an a cappella version as his character walks to the execution chamber. The song was featured in the 2021 film\" Black Widow\". It is the favorite song of the character Yelena Belova, and is sung by Red Guardian later in the film to comfort her. That same year it was featured in the film \"Finch\".\nMadonna version.\nBackground and release.\nAmerican singer Madonna recorded a cover version of \"American Pie\" for the soundtrack of her film \"The Next Best Thing\" (2000). Her cover is much shorter than the original, containing only the beginning of the first verse and all of the second and sixth verses. Reworked as a dance-pop track, it was produced by Madonna and William Orbit. It was recorded in September 1999 in New York City, after Rupert Everett, Madonna's co-star in \"The Next Best Thing\", convinced her to cover the song for the film's soundtrack. Madonna said of her choice to cover the song: \"To me, it's a real millennium song. We're going through a big change in terms of the way we view pop culture, because of the Internet. In a way, it's like saying goodbye to music as we knew it\u2014and to pop culture as we knew it.\" \"American Pie\" was released as the lead single from \"The Next Best Thing\" on February 8, 2000, by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records.\n\"American Pie\" was later included as an international bonus track on her eighth studio album, \"Music\" (2000). However, it was not included on her greatest hits compilation \"GHV2\" (2001), as Madonna had regretted putting it on \"Music\", elaborating: \"It was something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing, but it didn't belong on the album so now it's being punished... My gut told me not to [put the song on \"Music\"], but I did it and then I regretted it so just for that reason it didn't deserve a place on \"GHV2\"\". A remix of the song was featured on her remix compilation album \"\" (2022).\nReception.\n\"American Pie\" was an international hit, reaching number one in numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Iceland, Mexico, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Finland. The song was the 19th-best-selling single of 2000 in the UK and the ninth best-selling single of 2000 in Sweden. The single was not released commercially in the United States, but it reached number 29 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 due to strong radio airplay.\nDespite the commercial success, the cover received mixed to unfavorable reviews from music critics. Chuck Taylor of \"Billboard\" was impressed by the recording and commented, \"Applause to Madonna for not pandering to today's temporary trends and for challenging programmers to broaden their playlists. ... In all, a fine preview of the forthcoming soundtrack to \"The Next Best Thing\".\" Peter Robinson of \"The Guardian\" called the cover as \"brilliant\". Don McLean himself praised the cover, saying it was \"a gift from a goddess\", and that her version is \"mystical and sensual\". \"NME\", on the other hand, gave it a negative review, saying that \"Killdozer did it first and did it better\", that it was \"sub-karaoke fluff\" and that \"it's a blessing she didn't bother recording the whole thing.\" It was rated number 3 in both a 2011 \"Rolling Stone\" reader poll and a 2023 \"A.V. Club\" article ranking the worst cover songs of all time. It was the only song to appear in the top five on both lists.\nIn 2017, the Official Charts Company stated the song had sold 400,000 copies in the United Kingdom and was her 16th best selling single to date in the nation.\nMusic video.\nThe music video, filmed in the southern United States and in London, and directed by Philipp St\u00f6lzl, depicts a diverse array of ordinary Americans, including scenes showing same-sex couples kissing. Throughout the music video Madonna, who is wearing a tiara on her head, dances and sings in front of a large American flag.\nTwo versions of the video were produced, the first of which was released as the official video worldwide, and later appeared on Madonna's \"\" (2009). The second version used the \"Humpty Remix\", a more upbeat and dance-friendly version of the song. The latter aired on MTV in the US to promote \"The Next Best Thing\"; it features different footage and new outtakes of the original while omitting the lesbian kiss. Everett, who provides backing vocals in the song, is also featured in the video.\nFormats and track listings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCredits and personnel.\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes for \"American Pie\".\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "51745", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51745", "title": "Baen Books", "text": "American science fiction and fantasy publisher\nBaen Books () is an American publishing house for science fiction and fantasy. In science fiction, it emphasizes space opera, hard science fiction, and military science fiction. The company was established in 1983 by science fiction publisher and editor Jim Baen. After his death in 2006, he was succeeded as publisher by long-time executive editor Toni Weisskopf.\nHistory.\nBaen Books was founded in 1983 out of a negotiated agreement between Jim Baen and Simon &amp; Schuster. Simon &amp; Schuster was undergoing massive reorganization and wanted to hire Baen to head and revitalize the science fiction line of its Pocket Books division. Baen, with financial backing from some friends, counteroffered with a proposal to start up a new company named Baen Books and provide Simon &amp; Schuster with a science fiction line to distribute instead.\nAccording to \"Locus\"'s 2004 Book Summary, Baen Books was the ninth most active publisher in the U.S. in terms of most books published in the genres indicated, and the fifth most active publisher of the dedicated science fiction imprints, publishing a total of 67 titles (of which 40 were original titles). Based on the number of times a title published by Baen Books appeared in the bestseller lists produced by the major bookselling chains, it is ranked the seventh most popular science fiction publisher. In 2005, Baen moved up to the eighth position in the total books published with 72 books published (of which 40 were original titles).\nElectronic publishing.\nBeginning in mid-1999, Baen emphasized electronic publishing and Internet-focused promotions for its publications. The discussions on Baen's bar convinced him to do so. Baen's electronic strategy is explained exhaustively in a series of \"letters\" or \"essays\" called The Prime Palaver by Baen Free Library \"First Librarian\" Eric Flint, but in a nutshell, emphasizes distribution of unencrypted digital versions of its works free of digital rights management copy protection schemes through Baen Ebooks (formerly Webscriptions, which was not formally part of Baen Books, but in effect an independent e-publisher). Baen and his successors believe that DRM does more harm than good to a publisher. Consequently, Baen also makes its entire catalog available in multiple formats for downloading and typically prices electronic versions of its books at or below that of paperback editions\u2014and makes a profit doing it. According to essays on Baen's science fiction e-magazine \"Jim Baen's Universe\", also edited by Flint, the strategy is if anything, getting stronger and more fruitful with the passage of time, especially with the advent of e-book readers such as the Amazon Kindle, and the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook.\nBaen's Bar.\nInitially, the company invested resources in \"Baen's Bar\", its online community service that provides a forum for customers, authors, and editors to interact, beginning as a BBS. In the early 2000s, a blogger wrote: \"Like every other publisher, Jim Baen set up a website. But several of his authors and fan friends convinced him to put a chat client on his site. Since he was interested, and since several of those authors (like Jerry Pournelle, a former columnist for \"Byte Magazine\", for instance) were very Internet savvy, he did. The chat client grew into an incredibly vibrant community called Baen's Bar.\"\nOn February 15, 2021, American author Jason Sanford posted via Patreon \"Baen Books Forum Being Used to Advocate for Political Violence\". Publisher Toni Weisskopf released a statement.\nIn response to the allegations and the documented evidence provided to them, the DisCon III Convention Committee revoked Toni Weisskopf's Guest of Honor status at the 2021 Worldcon.{\nAnnouncing the reopening of Baen's Bar on April 9th, 2021, Weisskopf issued a denial of allegations against the forum.\nOn reopening, the Forum was then made private to members only, with membership restricted to those who make a purchase from the Baen Books website.\nThe public controversy over Baen's Bar led to former Baen Books author and former Baen's Bar participant Mercedes Lackey to contact Sandford to discuss her own exit. She wanted to respond to why there was a \"Posted rule\" on Baen's Bar banning discussion of her leaving, which alleged Lackey had a personal grievance against Jim Baen. Sandford posted this as an update to his Patreon post.\nBaen's Webscriptions.\nIn addition to selling individual titles in electronic format, Baen has distributed serialized e-book versions of new books at reduced prices in monthly bundles. Originally called \"Webscriptions\", these \"Monthly Baen Bundles\" are scheduled three months in advance of print publication. Webscription.net was implemented by Baen's preferred website expert, Arnold Bailey, who also sold e-books for other publishers. At the start of 2012, the Webscription.net website was redesigned, renamed to Baen Ebooks, and moved to baenebooks.com. Despite the new name, Baen Ebooks continues to sell e-books for other publishers, notably science fiction genre rival Night Shade Books.\nBaen's standard setup is based on monthly bundles. Each month, whichever books Baen has coming out in paper (paperback or hardcover, new or reissued) are bundled put together in a fixed price (currently $20) bundle regardless of the number of books (historically 4\u20139 books, average 5\u20136). The \"Monthly Baen Bundles\" are released in installments beginning three months prior to physical publication. The first installment released three months prior to paper publication includes roughly a half of every book in the bundle, with some books usually included in their entirety. The second installment, two months prior to print publication includes roughly three quarters, and the third installment on the 16th of the month prior to official print release includes the full text. The first two installments are generally available only as HTML, while the last includes all formats supported. Each bundle can only be bought until the 15th of the month prior to official print publication, which is about the time the printed books reach retailers. (Until December 2012, bundles remained on sale indefinitely.)\nAnother avenue for distribution that Baen uses for some of its new titles is the offering of eARCs (electronic advance reading copies) 3 to 5 months prior to publication. Marketed as a premium product for the fans who absolutely positively have to read it now, they are priced at $15 per single title and can differ from the final text (as they are electronic proofs). After print publication, the \"cleaned up and finalized\" electronic copy is available both online through the monthly bundle or as a single title (priced variably $7\u201310, older titles are less).\nThe electronic versions by Baen are produced in five common formats (HTML, Palm Pilot/Mobipocket/Kindle format, Rocketbook, EPUB/Stanza, Sony LRF, RTF, and MS Reader versions), all unencrypted in drastic contrast to the rest of the e-publishing industries strategy. Jim Baen disliked Adobe's portable document format for reading purposes, but Baen Ebooks offers some non-Baen titles in that format. When customers purchase a title from Baen, they can read it online or download it in any format they want as often as they want. Baen instituted a parallel practice of using promotional CD-ROMs with permissive copyright licenses containing many of its stable of authors' works. Whether downloaded or by CD-ROM, the source material is available in all the formats Baen supports.\nThe great majority of books published by Baen are still available as e-books, long after the hardcover or paperback versions have gone out of print. This is especially important for midlist titles, which rarely get reprinted. Until December 2012, it was also possible to purchase older monthly bundles.\nBaen has made liberal use of free content in its marketing efforts. For example, free sample chapters of its books are typically available on the Baen Web site. The \"Baen Free Library\" allows free access to dozens of titles from the company's backlist, often the first book published in a series by a Baen author. Baen also provides free electronic copies of its books to readers who are blind, paralyzed, dyslexic, or are amputees.\nBaen's emphasis on electronic publishing has generated press coverage for the company. In 2001, \"Wired\" magazine described Webscriptions as \"innovative\". Charles N. Brown, publisher of \"Locus\" magazine, has praised Baen's approach in an interview in \"The New York Times\", saying \"Baen has shown that putting up electronic versions of books doesn't cost you sales. It gains you a larger audience for all of your books. As a result, they've done quite well.\"\nMagazine experiments.\nBaen's first run at magazine-style book publishing took place in the late 1970s, in the form of \"Destinies\", a quarterly 'bookazine' that featured fiction and non-fiction by well-known and new authors that Baen was promoting. It was published by Ace, where Baen was employed at the time. Under the aegis of Baen Books in the 1980s, he published two more bookazine series. The first was \"Far Frontiers\". The second was \"New Destinies\", edited by Baen, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Michael A. Banks.\n\"The Grantville Gazettes\".\nBaen's began the experimental publication of \"The Grantville Gazette\", an e-magazine anthology series specifically related to the popular \"Ring of Fire\" alternate history plenum. The \"Gazettes\" are professionally edited and approved fan fiction. They are published on a regular schedule and available individually at Baen Books or Amazon, or by subscription.\n\"Jim Baen's Universe\".\nIn the early 2000s, Baen tried magazine-like publishing again, establishing two self-sustaining e-zine enterprises with a separate staff for each, both spearheaded by Eric Flint: \"Jim Baen's Universe\" and the \"Grantville Gazette\" series, which was reconfigured after \"Grantville Gazette V\".\nThe general audience speculative fiction anthology \"Baen's Universe\" is available only online. At approximately 120,000 words, this latter publication is unusually large when compared to most traditional print editions of science fiction magazines, and the average size of the newly reconfigured \"Gazette\"s is similarly generous.\nBaen Digital Object Identifiers (DOI).\nFrom 1999 to 2011, Baen's e-books were produced by Webscriptions under contract for Baen Books in various (at least five) common digital formats. Because these multiple formats complicate the issue of identifying electronic versions, Baen and Webscriptions did not use DOIs to identify their e-books (even though some of their books had DOIs). The electronic e-ARC practices also complicate things in \"publications dates\", since the first released text starts two to three months before the release of the print copy, though the released text is not guaranteed to fully copy edited\u2014and so occasionally differs from the final released fully copy-edited versions. Thus, like the \"Grantville Gazettes\" the e-publication date antedates the print copy by about two months\u2014the interval before the release of the last third and the hardcover print edition is simultaneously released.\nAuthors and works.\nAuthors.\nAuthors whose works have been published by Baen include the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSeries.\nSeries published by Baen include the following:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "51746", "revid": "723154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51746", "title": "Cisco", "text": "American multinational technology company\nCisco Systems, Inc. (using the trademark Cisco) is an American multinational digital communications technology conglomerate corporation headquartered in San Jose, California. Cisco develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment and other high-technology services and products. Cisco specializes in specific tech markets, such as the Internet of things (IoT), domain security, videoconferencing, and energy management with products including Webex, OpenDNS, Jabber, Duo Security, Silicon One, and Jasper.\nCisco Systems was founded in December 1984 by Leonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner, two Stanford University computer scientists. They pioneered the concept of a local area network (LAN) being used to connect distant computers over a multiprotocol router system. The company went public in 1990 and, by the end of the dot-com bubble in 2000, had a market capitalization of $500 billion, surpassing Microsoft as the world's most valuable company.\nCisco stock (CSCO), trading on Nasdaq since 1990, was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average on June 8, 2009. It is also included in the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq-100, and the Russell 1000 indices.\nHistory.\n1984\u20131995.\nCisco Systems was founded in December 1984 by Sandy Lerner, along with her husband Leonard Bosack. Lerner was the director of computer facilities for the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. Bosack was in charge of the Stanford University computer science department's computers.\nCisco's initial product has roots in Stanford University's campus technology. In the early 1980s, students and staff at Stanford, including Bosack, used technology on the campus to link all of the school's computer systems to talk to one another, creating a box that functioned as a multi-protocol router called the \"Blue Box\". The Blue Box used circuitry made by Andy Bechtolsheim, and software that was originally written at Stanford by research engineer William Yeager. Due to the underlying architecture, and its ability to scale well, Yeager's well-designed invention became a key to Cisco's early success.\nIn 1985, Bosack and Stanford employee Kirk Lougheed began a project to formally network Stanford's campus. They adapted Yeager's software into what became the foundation for Cisco IOS, despite Yeager's claims that he had been denied permission to sell the Blue Box commercially. On July 11, 1986, Bosack and Lougheed were forced to resign from Stanford and the university contemplated filing criminal complaints against Cisco and its founders for the theft of its software, hardware designs, and other intellectual properties. In 1987, Stanford licensed the router software and two computer boards to Cisco. In addition to Bosack, Lerner, Lougheed, Greg Satz (a programmer), and Richard Troiano (who handled sales), completed the early Cisco team. The company's first CEO was Bill Graves, who held the position from 1987 to 1988. In 1988, John Morgridge was appointed CEO.\nThe name \"Cisco\" was derived from the city name \"San Francisco\", which is why the company's engineers insisted on using the lower case \"cisco\" in its early years. The logo is a stylized depiction of the two towers of the Golden Gate Bridge.\nOn February 16, 1990, Cisco Systems went public with a market capitalization of $224\u00a0million, and was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. On August 28, 1990, Lerner was fired. Upon hearing the news, her husband Bosack resigned in protest.\nAlthough Cisco was not the first company to develop and sell dedicated network nodes, it was one of the first to sell commercially successful routers supporting multiple network protocols. Classical, CPU-based architecture of early Cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system IOS allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent software upgrades. Some popular models of that time (such as Cisco 2500) managed to stay in production for almost a decade virtually unchanged. The company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment, entering the SP market with product lines such as Cisco 7000 and Cisco 8500.\nBetween 1992 and 1994, Cisco acquired several companies in Ethernet switching, such as Kalpana, Grand Junction and most notably, Mario Mazzola's Crescendo Communications, which together formed the Catalyst business unit. At the time, the company envisioned layer 3 routing and layer 2 (Ethernet, Token Ring) switching as complementary functions of different intelligence and architecture\u2014the former was slow and complex, the latter was fast but simple. This philosophy dominated the company's product lines throughout the 1990s.\nIn 1995, John Morgridge was succeeded by John T. Chambers.\n1996\u20132005: Internet and silicon intelligence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nLogo used in the 1990s and early 2000s \nThe Internet Protocol (IP) became widely adopted in the mid-to-late 1990s. Cisco introduced products ranging from modem access shelves (AS5200) to core GSR routers, making them a major player in the market. In late March 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, Cisco became the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of more than $500\u00a0billion. As of July 2014, with a market cap of about US$129\u00a0billion, it was still one of the most valuable companies.\nThe perceived complexity of programming routing functions in silicon led to the formation of several startups determined to find new ways to process IP and MPLS packets entirely in hardware and blur boundaries between routing and switching. One of them, Juniper Networks, shipped their first product in 1999 and by 2000 chipped away about 30% from Cisco SP Market share. In response, Cisco later developed homegrown ASICs and fast processing cards for GSR routers and Catalyst 6500 switches. In 2004, Cisco also started the migration to new high-end hardware CRS-1 and software architecture IOS XR.\n2006\u20132012: The Human Network.\nAs part of a rebranding campaign in 2006, Cisco Systems adopted the shortened name \"Cisco\" and created \"The Human Network\" advertising campaign. These efforts were meant to make Cisco a \"household\" brand\u2014a strategy designed to support the low-end Linksys products and future consumer products.\nOn the more traditional business side, Cisco continued to develop its routing, switching and security portfolio. The quickly growing importance of Ethernet also influenced the company's product lines. Limits of IOS and aging Crescendo architecture also forced Cisco to look at merchant silicon in the carrier Ethernet segment. This resulted in a new ASR 9000 product family intended to consolidate the company's carrier Ethernet and subscriber management business around EZChip-based hardware and IOS-XR.\nIn March 2007, Cisco acquired Reactivity Inc, a privately held XML gateway provider based in Redwood City, California. Cisco placed the Reactivity team and product portfolio under its Datacenter Switching and Security Technology Group, which reported to the company's then senior vice president Jayshree Ullal.\nThroughout the mid-2000s, Cisco also built a significant presence in India, establishing its Globalization Centre East in Bangalore for $1\u00a0billion. Cisco also expanded into new markets by acquisition\u2014one example being a 2009 purchase of mobile specialist Starent Networks.\nCisco continued to be challenged by both domestic competitors Alcatel-Lucent, Juniper Networks, and an overseas competitor Huawei. Due to lower-than-expected profit in 2011, Cisco reduced annual expenses by $1 billion. The company cut around 3,000 employees with an early-retirement program who accepted a buyout and planned to eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs (around 14 percent of the 73,400 total employees before curtailment). During the 2011 analyst call, Cisco's CEO John Chambers called out several competitors by name, including Juniper and HP.\nOn July 24, 2012, Cisco received approval from the EU to acquire NDS (a TV software developer) for US$5 billion. In 2013, Cisco sold its Linksys home-router unit to Belkin International Inc., signaling a shift to sales to businesses rather than consumers.\n2013\u2013present.\nOn July 23, 2013, Cisco Systems announced a definitive agreement to acquire Sourcefire for $2.7 billion. On August 14, 2013, Cisco Systems announced it would cut 4,000 jobs from its workforce, which was roughly 6%, starting in 2014. At the end of 2013, Cisco announced poor revenue due to depressed sales in emerging markets, caused by economic uncertainty and by fears of the National Security Agency planting backdoors in its products.\nIn April 2014, Cisco announced funding for early-stage firms to focus on the Internet of Things. The investment fund was allocated to investments in IoT accelerators and startups such as The Alchemist Accelerator, Ayla Networks and EVRYTHNG. Later that year, the company announced it was laying off another 6,000 workers or 8% of its global workforce, as part of a second restructuring. On November 4, 2014, Cisco announced an investment in Stratoscale.\nOn May 4, 2015, Cisco announced CEO and Chairman John Chambers would step down as CEO on July 26, 2015, but remain chairman. Chuck Robbins, senior vice president of worldwide sales &amp; operations and 17-year Cisco veteran, was announced as the next CEO. On July 23, 2015, Cisco announced the divestiture of its television set-top-box and cable modem business to Technicolor SA for $600 million, a division originally formed by Cisco's $6.9 billion purchase of Scientific Atlanta. The deal came as part of Cisco's gradual exit from the consumer market, and as part of an effort by Cisco's new leadership to focus on cloud-based products in enterprise segments. Cisco indicated that it would still collaborate with Technicolor on video products. On November 19, 2015, Cisco, alongside ARM Holdings, Dell, Intel, Microsoft and Princeton University, founded the OpenFog Consortium, to promote interests and development in fog computing.\nIn January 2016, Cisco invested in VeloCloud, a software-defined WAN (SD-WAN) start-up with a cloud offering for configuring and optimizing branch office networks. Cisco contributed to VeloCloud's $27 million Series C round, led by March Capital Partners.\nIn February 2017, Cisco launched a cloud-based secure internet gateway, called Cisco Umbrella, to provide safe internet access to users who do not use their corporate networks or VPNs to connect to remote data centers. Immediately after reporting their fourth-quarter earnings for 2017, Cisco's price-per-share value jumped by over 7%, while its earnings per share ratio increased from 60 to 61 cents per share, due in part to Cisco's outperformance of analyst expectations. In September 2017, Chambers announced that he would step down from the executive chairman role at the end of his term on the board in December 2017. On December 11, 2017, Robbins was elected to succeed Chambers as executive chairman while retaining his role as CEO, and Chambers was given the title of \"Chairman Emeritus\".\nReuters reported that \"Cisco Systems Inc's (CSCO.O) product revenue in Russia grew 20 percent in 2017, ahead of Cisco's technology product revenue growth in the other so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, China and India.\" As of 2017, Cisco Systems shares were mainly held by institutional investors, including The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and State Street Corporation.)\nOn May 1, 2018, Cisco Systems agreed to buy AI-driven business intelligence startup Accompany for $270 million. As of June 2018, Cisco Systems ranked 444th on Forbes Global 2000 list, with $221.3 billion market cap.\nIn 2019, Cisco acquired CloudCherry, a customer experience management company, and Voicea, an artificial intelligence company.\nIn 2019, Cisco also introduced the \"Silicon One\" ASIC chip with the G100 model reaching a speed of 25.6\u00a0Tbit/s. The Silicon One competes against the Tomahawk series by Broadcom the Nvidia Spectrum, the Marvell Teralynx and the Intel Tofino. In 2023, the Silicon One G200 will offer a speed of 51.2\u00a0Tbit/sec.\nIn March 2020, SVP and GM of Enterprise Networking David Goeckeler left to become CEO of Western Digital. and was replaced by Todd Nightingale, head of Cisco Meraki. In August 2020, Cisco announced the creation of a new 130,000 square feet Midwest headquarters in Chicago at the Old Chicago Main Post Office accommodating 1,200 employees. Cisco maintains over 200 corporate offices in more than 80 countries.\nIn October 2022, Cisco announced a partnership adding the Microsoft Teams app to its meeting devices.\nIn 2022, Cisco completely curtailed sales of its equipment in Russia due to Russian invasion of Ukraine, and completely discontinued service for already-sold devices. In April 2023, it became known that the company had destroyed equipment, spare parts, and even vehicles and office furniture worth 1.86 billion rubles (about $23 million) due to the impossibility of re-exporting. In February 2023, Cisco also wrote off the debt of the Russian mobile operator MTS in the amount of 1.234 billion rubles. As expected, these are unpaid amounts for previous equipment deliveries. In 2023, Cisco announced plans to begin manufacturing equipment in India.\nOn February 15, 2024, Cisco announced it would lay off more than 4,000 employees, or 5% of its global workforce, and lowered its annual revenue forecast due to economic challenges and reduced demand from telecom and cable service providers.\nOn March 5, 2024, Cisco Systems announced to secure unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $28 billion bid for cybersecurity firm Splunk.\nOn April 24, 2024, Chuck Robbins, CEO of Cisco, met with Pope Francis and signed the Rome Call for AI ethics at the Vatican, endorsing the document's principles for responsible and ethical AI use. \nOn August 14, 2024, Cisco announced it would lay off another 7% of employees as part of an effort to consolidate its networking, security, and collaboration teams. At the same time, it announced $10.3 billion in profit for the fiscal year. \nOn October 2024 Cisco consolidated its corporate offices in the Bay Area and moved its main headquarters to the former Splunk office on the south side of Santana Row in San Jose.\nOn August 13, 2025, Cisco against announced it would eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices. At the same time, the company once again announced an 8% increase in revenue for the fiscal year.\nAcquisitions and subsidiaries.\nCisco acquired a variety of companies to spin products and talent into the company. In 1995\u20131996 the company completed 11 acquisitions. Several acquisitions, such as Stratacom, were one of the biggest deals in the industry when they occurred. During the Internet boom in 1999, the company acquired Cerent Corporation, a start-up company located in Petaluma, California, for about US$7\u00a0billion. It was the most expensive acquisition made by Cisco to that date, and only the acquisition of Scientific Atlanta has been larger. In 1999, Cisco also acquired a stake for $1 billion in KPMG Consulting to enable establishing Internet firm Metrius founded by Keyur Patel of Fuse. Several acquired companies have grown into $1Bn+ business units for Cisco, including LAN switching, Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) platform Webex and home networking. The latter came as result of Cisco acquiring Linksys in 2003 and in 2010 was supplemented with new product line dubbed Cisco Valet.\nCisco announced on January 12, 2005, that it would acquire Airespace for US$450 million to reinforce the wireless controller product lines.\nCisco announced on January 4, 2007, that it would buy IronPort in a deal valued at US$830 million and completed the acquisition on June 25, 2007. IronPort was best known for its IronPort AntiSpam, its SenderBase email reputation service and its email security appliances. Accordingly, IronPort was integrated into the Cisco Security business unit. Ironport's Senderbase was renamed as Sensorbase to take account of the input into this database that other Cisco devices provide. SensorBase allows these devices to build a risk profile on IP addresses, therefore allowing risk profiles to be dynamically created on http sites and SMTP email sources.\nIn 2010, Cisco bought Starent Networks (a mobile packet core company) for $2.9 billion and Moto Development Group, a product design consulting firm that helped develop Cisco's Flip video camera. Also in 2010, Cisco became a key stakeholder in \"e-Skills Week\". In March 2011, Cisco completed the acquisition of privately held network configuration and change management software company Pari Networks.\nAlthough many buy-ins (such as Crescendo Networks in 1993, Tandberg in 2010) resulted in acquisition of flagship technology to Cisco, many others have failed\u2014partially or completely. For instance, in 2010 Cisco occupied a meaningful share of the packet-optical market, revenues were still not on par with US$7\u00a0billion price tag paid in 1999 for Cerent. Some of acquired technologies (such as Flip from Pure Digital) saw their product lines terminated.\nCisco announced on March 15, 2012, that it would acquire NDS Group for $5bn.\nIn January 2013, Cisco Systems acquired Israeli software maker Intucell for around $475 million in cash, a move to expand its mobile network management offerings. In the same month, Cisco Systems acquired Cognitive Security, a company focused on Cyber Threat Protection. Cisco also acquired SolveDirect (cloud services) in March 2013 and UK-based Ubiquisys (mobile software) in April 2013 for $310 million.\nCisco acquired cyber-security firm Sourcefire, in October 2013. On June 16, 2014, Cisco announced that it has completed the acquisition of ThreatGRID, a company that provided dynamic malware analysis and threat intelligence technology.\nOn June 17, 2014, Cisco announced its intent to acquire privately held Tail-f Systems, a leader in configuration management software.\nOn April 2, 2015, Cisco announced plans to buy Embrane, a software-defined networking startup. The deal will give Cisco Embrane's software platform, which provides layer 3\u20137 network services for things such as firewalls, VPN termination, server load balancers and SSL offload.\nOn May 7, 2015, Cisco announced plans to buy Tropo, a cloud API platform that simplifies the addition of real-time communications and collaboration capabilities within applications.\nOn June 30, 2015, Cisco acquired privately held OpenDNS, the company best known for its DNS service that adds a level of security by monitoring domain name requests.\nOn August 6, 2015, Cisco announced that it has completed the acquisition of privately held MaintenanceNet, the US-based company best known for its cloud-based contract management platform ServiceExchange. On the same month, Cisco acquired Pawaa, a privately held company in Bangalore, India that provides secure on-premises and cloud-based file-sharing software.\nOn September 30, 2015, Cisco announced its intent to acquire privately held Portcullis Computer Security, a UK-based company that provides cybersecurity services to enterprise clients and the government sectors.\nOn October 26, 2015, Cisco announced its intent to acquire ParStream, a privately held company based in Cologne, Germany, that provides an analytics database that allows companies to analyze large amounts of data and store it in near real-time anywhere in the network.\nOn October 27, 2015, Cisco announced that it would acquire Lancope, a company that focuses on detecting threat activity, for $452.5 million in a cash-and-equity deal.\nOn June 28, 2016, Cisco announced its intent to acquire CloudLock, a privately held cloud security company founded in 2011 by three Israeli military veterans, for $293 million. The deal was expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.\nIn August 2016, Cisco announced it is getting closer to making a deal to acquire Springpath, the startup whose technology is used in Cisco's HyperFlex Systems. Cisco already owns an undisclosed stake in the hyper-converged provider. In September 2023, Cisco announced discontinuation of its HyperFlex infrastructure products.\nIn January 2017, Cisco announced they would acquire AppDynamics, a company that monitors application performance, for $3.7 billion. The acquisition came just one day before AppDynamics was set to IPO.\nOn January 26, 2017, Cisco founded the Innovation Alliance in Germany with eleven other companies bringing together 40 sites and 2,000 staff to provide small businesses in Germany with expertise.\nOn August 1, 2017, Cisco completed the acquisition of Viptela Inc. for $610 million in cash and assumed equity awards. Viptela was a privately held software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) company based in San Jose, Ca.\nOn October 23, 2017, Cisco Systems announced it would be acquiring Broadsoft for $1.9 Billion to further entrench itself in the cloud communication and collaboration area.\nOn August 7, 2020, Cisco completed its acquisition of network intelligence company ThousandEyes for around $1 billion.\nOn October 1, 2020, Cisco announced that it would be acquiring Israeli startup Portshift for a reported $100 million.\nOn December 7, 2020, Cisco announced that it would be acquiring Slido to improve Q&amp;A, polls and engagement in WebEx videoconferencing\nOn December 7, 2020, Cisco announced the acquisition of U.K based IMImobile in a $730M deal.\nOn May 3, 2021, Cisco completed its acquisition of Q&amp;A and polling platform Slido, which they offered both as a standalone product and with integrations.\nIn 2023, Cisco acquired the following cybersecurity companies: Valtix, Lightspin, and Armorblox. Cisco also announced its intention to acquire networking and security startup Isovalent later that year.\nOn September 21, 2023, Cisco announced the acquisition of cybersecurity firm Splunk in a $28 billion deal, its biggest acquisition yet, and the acquisition is announced to be completed on March 18, 2024.\nProducts and services.\nCisco provides IT products and services across five major technology areas: networking, security, collaboration, data center and IoT.\nCisco is the dominant vendor in the Australian market across all market segments. It uses its Australian office as one of the main headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region.\nHosted Collaboration Solution (HCS).\nCisco partners offer cloud-based services based on Cisco's virtualized Unified Computing System (UCS). The Cisco Unified Services Delivery Solution includes hosted versions of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM), Cisco Unified Contact Center, Cisco Unified Mobility, Cisco Unified Presence, Cisco Unity Connection (unified messaging) and Cisco Webex Meeting Center.\nNetwork Emergency Response.\nAs part of its Crisis Response initiative, Cisco maintains several Network Emergency Response Vehicles (NERV)s. The vehicles are maintained and deployed by Cisco employees during natural disasters and other public crises. The vehicles are self-contained and provide wired and wireless services including voice and radio interoperability, voice over IP, network-based video surveillance and secured high-definition video-conferencing for leaders and first responders in crisis areas with up to 3-72\u00a0Mbit/s of bandwidth (up and down) via a 1.8-meter satellite antenna.\nNERVs are based at Cisco headquarters sites in San Jose, California, and at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, allowing strategic deployment in North America. They can become fully operational within 15 minutes of arrival. High-capacity diesel fuel-tanks allow the largest vehicles to run for up to 72 hours continuously. The NERV has been deployed to incidents such as the October 2007 California wildfires; hurricanes Gustav, Ike and Katrina; the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion, tornado outbreaks in North Carolina and Alabama in 2011; and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\nThe Crisis Response Operations team maintains and deploys smaller, more portable communication kits to emergencies outside of North America. In 2010, the team deployed to assist in earthquake recovery in Haiti and Christchurch (New Zealand). In 2011, they deployed to flooding in Brazil, as well as in response to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.\nIn 2011, Cisco received the Innovation Preparedness award from the American Red Cross Silicon Valley Chapter for its development and use of these vehicles in disasters.\nCertifications.\nCisco Systems also sponsors a line of IT professional certifications for Cisco products. There are five (path to network designers) levels of certification: Entry (CCT), Associate (CCNA/CCDA), Specialist (Cisco Certified Specialist), Professional (CCNP/CCDP), Expert (CCIE/CCDE), and recently Architect (CCAr: CCDE previous), as well as eight different paths, Collaboration, CyberOps, Data Center, DevNet, Enterprise, Security, and Service Provider.\nCisco also provides training for these certifications via a portal called the Cisco Networking Academy. Qualifying schools can become members of the Cisco Networking Academy and then provide CCNA level or other level courses. Cisco Academy Instructors must be CCNA certified to be a CCAI certified instructor. \nIn March 2013, Cisco announced its interest in Myanmar by investing in two Cisco Networking Academies in Yangon and Mandalay and a channel partner network.\nCorporate affairs.\nFacilities.\nCisco is headquartered in San Jose, California at 170 West Tasman Dr. with dozens of buildings comprising its corporate campus. Over 15,000 full-time employees are based at the San Jose campus and the surrounding Bay Area. Cisco's second largest campus in the United States is located at Research Triangle Park in North Carolina with 7,000 employees spanning across 12 buildings.\nAwards and accolades.\nCisco products, including IP phones and Telepresence, have been seen in movies and TV series. The company was featured in the documentary film \"Something Ventured\" which premiered in 2011.\nCisco was a 2002\u201303 recipient of the Ron Brown Award, a U.S. presidential honor to recognize companies \"for the exemplary quality of their relationships with employees and communities\". Cisco ranked number one in Great Place to Work's World's Best Workplaces 2019. In 2020, \"Fortune\" magazine ranked Cisco Systems at number four on their Fortune List of the Top 100 Companies to Work For in 2020 based on an employee survey of satisfaction.\nAccording to a report by technology consulting firm LexInnova, Cisco was one of the leading recipients of network security-related patents with the largest portfolio within other companies (6,442 security-related patents) in 2015.\nIn 2024, Cisco was awarded Best Office Phone for its CP-8861 model by PhonePrices.co.uk.\nSponsorship.\nIn February 2021, Webex signed a multi-year partnership with McLaren Racing as the Official Collaboration Partner of the team. In the following year, the partnership was extended to Cisco as the Official Technology Partner of the team. In October 2023, Cisco was announced as the Official Primary Partner of the McLaren F1 Academy programme. Cisco's branding will be carried on Bianca Bustamante's car, race suit and team kit in the 2024 F1 Academy season.\nControversies.\nShareholder relations.\nA class action lawsuit filed on April 20, 2001, accused Cisco of making misleading statements that \"were relied on by purchasers of Cisco stock\" and of insider trading. While Cisco denied all allegations in the suit, on August 18, 2006, Cisco's liability insurers, its directors and officers paid the plaintiffs US$91.75\u00a0million to settle the suit.\nIntellectual property disputes.\nOn December 11, 2008, the Free Software Foundation filed suit against Cisco regarding Cisco's failure to comply with the GPL and LGPL licenses and make the applicable source code publicly available. On May 20, 2009, Cisco settled this lawsuit by complying with FSF licensing terms and making a monetary contribution to the FSF.\nIn October 2020, Cisco was ordered to pay US$1.9 billion to Centripetal Networks for infringement on four cybersecurity patents.\nChina.\nCisco has been criticized for its involvement in censorship in the People's Republic of China. According to author Ethan Gutmann, Cisco and other telecommunications equipment providers supplied the Chinese government with surveillance and Internet infrastructure equipment that is used to block Internet websites and track online activities in China. Cisco has stated that it does not customize or develop specialized or unique filtering capabilities to enable governments to block access to information and that it sells the same equipment in China as it sells worldwide.\nWired News had uncovered a purported leaked, confidential PowerPoint presentation from Cisco that detailed the commercial opportunities of the Golden Shield Project of Internet control. In May 2011, a group of Falun Gong practitioners filed a lawsuit under the Alien Tort Statute alleging that Cisco knowingly developed and customized its product to assist the Chinese government in prosecution and abuse of Falun Gong practitioners. The lawsuit was dismissed in September 2014 by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, which decision was appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in September 2015. On July 7, 2023, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court's decision and ruled the lawsuit may proceed to trial. Cisco filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court.\nIn 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including Cisco, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang.\nTax fraud investigation.\nIn October 2007, employees of Cisco's Brazilian unit were arrested on charges that they had imported equipment without paying import duties. In response, Cisco stated that they do not import directly into Brazil, and instead use middlemen.\nAntitrust lawsuit.\nOn December 1, 2008, Multiven filed an antitrust lawsuit against Cisco Systems, Inc. Multiven's complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes/patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services (SMARTnet). In May 2010, Cisco accused the person who filed the antitrust suit, British-Nigerian technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye, with hacking and pressured the US government to extradite him from Canada. Cisco settled the antitrust lawsuit two months after Alfred-Adekeye's arrest by making its software updates available to all Multiven customers.\nRemotely monitoring users' connections.\nCisco's Linksys E2700, E3500, E4500 devices have been reported to be remotely updated to a firmware version that forces users to register for a cloud service, allows Cisco to monitor their network use and ultimately shut down the cloud service account and thus render the affected router unusable.\nFirewall backdoor developed by NSA.\nAccording to the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" the NSA has developed JETPLOW for gaining access to ASA (series 5505, 5510, 5520, 5540 and 5550) and 500-series PIX Firewalls.\nCisco's Chief Security Officer addressed the allegations publicly and denied working with any government to weaken Cisco products for exploitation or to implement security backdoors.\nA document included in the trove of National Security Agency files released with Glenn Greenwald's book \"No Place to Hide\" details how the agency's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit and other NSA employees intercept servers, routers and other network gear being shipped to organizations targeted for surveillance and install covert firmware onto them before they are delivered. These Trojan horse systems were described by an NSA manager as being \"some of the most productive operations in TAO because they pre-position access points into hard target networks around the world.\"\nCisco denied the allegations in a customer document saying that no information was included about specific Cisco products, supply chain intervention or implant techniques, or new security vulnerabilities. Cisco's general counsel also said that Cisco does not work with any government, including the United States government, to weaken its products. The allegations are reported to have prompted the company's CEO to express concern to the President of the United States. Whistle blowers like Edward Snowden, and journalist reporter Julian Assange have echoed similar sentiments publicly.\nSpherix patent suit.\nIn March 2014, Spherix Incorporated initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Cisco Systems in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Spherix alleged that Cisco's routers and switches infringed upon 11 patents it had acquired from the defunct Canadian telecommunications company Nortel Networks. The patents pertained to technologies related to networking and telecommunications equipment.\nSpherix contended that Cisco's sales of these products in the United States over a five-year period, ending July 27, 2013, amounted to over $43 billion, the majority of which allegedly utilized the patented technologies. The lawsuit sought unspecified damages and accused Cisco of willful infringement.\nIn June 2015, the court ruled in favor of Cisco, granting summary judgment of non-infringement. The decision was based on the finding that Spherix had failed to demonstrate that Cisco's products infringed upon the asserted patents. This ruling effectively dismissed the case, concluding the legal proceedings in favor of Cisco.\nAs of June 2025, there have been no further legal actions or developments related to this particular lawsuit.\nIndia net censorship role.\nAs of April\u00a02020[ [update]] Cisco Systems is alleged to be helping the Indian Jammu and Kashmir administration build a firewall that will prevent Internet users in Kashmir from accessing blacklisted websites, including social media portals, through fixed-line connections. Cisco denies the allegations.\nCaste discrimination lawsuit.\nIn 2020, a lawsuit was initiated against Cisco and two of its employees by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing for alleged discrimination against an Indian engineer on account of him being from a lower caste than them.\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe Israeli military uses Cisco data centers to support its AI targeting operations in the Gaza Strip and other defense and intelligence activities. At least 32 Cisco employees lost 288 family members in Gaza since October 2023. Employees who have spoken out against Cisco's ties to Israel have been fired, attempts to organize employees in support of divestment have been censored, and the company banned discussion of the conflict in company meetings in April 2025.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "51749", "revid": "26343411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51749", "title": "Marco van Basten", "text": "Dutch football player and manager (born 1964)\nMarcel \"Marco\" van Basten (; born 31 October 1964) is a Dutch former football manager and player who played as a striker for Ajax and AC Milan, as well as the Netherlands national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he scored 300 goals in a high-profile career, but played his last match in 1993, at the age of 28, due to a recurring ankle injury which forced him to announce his retirement two years later. He was later the head coach of Ajax and the Netherlands national team.\nKnown for his close ball control, attacking intelligence, impeccable headers, and spectacular strikes and volleys, Van Basten was named FIFA World Player of the Year in 1992 and won the Ballon d'Or three times, in 1988, 1989 and 1992. At club level, he won three Eredivisie titles and the Cup Winners' Cup with Ajax, and four Serie A titles and two European Cups with Milan. With the Netherlands, Van Basten won UEFA Euro 1988 where he earned the Golden Boot, scoring five goals, including a memorable volley in the final against the Soviet Union, considered one of the best ever.\nIn 1998, Van Basten was ranked sixth in the FIFA Player of the Century internet poll, tenth in the European player of the Century election held by the IFFHS and 12th in the IFFHS' World Player of the Century election. He was also voted eighth in a poll organised by the French magazine \"France Football\", consulting their former Ballon d'Or winners to elect the Football Player of the Century. In 2004, he was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. In 2004, a poll for the 100 greatest Dutch people was held in the Netherlands: Van Basten ranked number 25, the second highest for a football player, behind Johan Cruyff. In 2007, \"Sky Sports\" ranked Van Basten first on its list of great athletes who had their careers cut short.\nPlaying career.\nEarly years.\nMarco van Basten was born on 31 October 1964 in Utrecht and grew up in the \"Oog In Al\" neighborhood. He began playing for a local team, EDO, when he was six years old. A year later, he moved to UVV Utrecht. After nine years there, he briefly played for another club from Utrecht, Elinkwijk.\nAjax.\nAjax signed 16-year-old Marco for the 1981\u201382 season. He played his first match for Ajax on 3 April 1982, coming on as a substitute for Johan Cruyff, and scoring a debut goal in the team's 5\u20130 victory over NEC.\nIn the 1982\u201383 season, he competed with the European top scorer and first choice Holland international Wim Kieft for the position of centre forward, and scored nine goals in 20 league matches. Ajax chose to sell Kieft to Italian Serie A club Pisa the following season, and 18 year old Van Basten solidified his position as his team's main attacker similarly in the national team.\nHe was the top scorer in the league for four consecutive seasons, from 1983\u201384 to 1986\u201387, scoring 118 goals in 112 matches. In the 1985\u201386 season, he scored 37 goals in 26 league matches, including six goals against Sparta Rotterdam and five against Heracles Almelo, and won the European Golden Boot. He also scored the winning goal in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final against Lokomotive Leipzig in 1987. In total he scored 128 goals in 133 league matches for Ajax. In November 1986 he scored his most famous goal in an Ajax jersey, a spectacular overhead kick against FC Den Bosch.\nAC Milan.\nIn 1987, Milan president Silvio Berlusconi signed Van Basten, along with fellow countryman Ruud Gullit. In 1988, the Dutch legion got completed when Frank Rijkaard joined the club (at the time only three non-Italians were allowed). In his first season, Milan won their first \"Scudetto\" in eight years, but Van Basten played only 11 matches and was constantly troubled by an ankle injury. In 1988\u201389, Van Basten won the Ballon d'Or as Europe's top footballer. He scored 19 goals in Serie A and 32 goals in all competitions that year, including two goals in the final of the European Cup, as Milan triumphed against Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. In 1989\u201390, he became \"Capocannoniere\" again (Serie A's leading goal scorer); Milan also successfully defended the European Cup after beating Benfica 1\u20130 in the final match, during which Van Basten provided the assist for Rijkaard's match-winning goal.\nMilan struggled in the 1990\u201391 season, as Sampdoria won the \"Scudetto\". After Van Basten fell out with Arrigo Sacchi, Berlusconi sacked the manager. Fabio Capello took over the following season, and Milan went undefeated in the league to win another \"Scudetto\". Van Basten scored 25 league goals, and became \"Capocannoniere\" again; his tally from the 1991\u201392 season was the highest number of goals that a player had scored in a single Serie A season since Lu\u00eds Vin\u00edcio achieved the same tally during the 1965\u201366 season.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Marco was the greatest striker I ever coached. His early retirement was a mortal misfortune for him, for football, and for Milan.\"\n\u2014Former Milan manager Fabio Capello in 2010 on working with Van Basten and his premature retirement.\nIn November 1992, he became the first player to score four goals in a Champions League match, against IFK G\u00f6teborg, including a picture perfect bicycle kick. In December 1992, Van Basten was named FIFA World Player of the Year. Milan stretched their unbeaten run into the 1992\u201393 season, going 58 matches over two seasons before they lost a match. Van Basten was exceptional in the early part of the season. He was again voted the European player of the year, becoming the third player after Johan Cruyff and Michel Platini to win the award three times.\nHis troublesome ankle injury recurred in a game against Ancona, forcing him to endure another six-month layoff, and undergo a series of surgeries. He returned for the last few matches in the season, before Milan lost 1\u20130 to Marseille in the Champions League final. The match was Van Basten's final match for the Italian club. He came off in the 86th minute for Stefano Eranio, after a hard tackle behind from Basile Boli condemned Van Basten to the third ankle surgery of his career.\nVan Basten had been hopeful of playing for his country at the 1994 World Cup as well as for his club in the 1994\u201395 season after spending the whole 1993\u201394 season out of action (missing Milan's victory in the European Cup as well as their Serie A title glory), but his club ordered him not to take part in the World Cup amid fear of ruining his rehabilitation. He finally conceded defeat in his battle to recover on 17 August 1995, when he announced his retirement as a player after two whole years on the sidelines. Van Basten made a farewell appearance to thank the Milan fans before a home game at the San Siro, with an emotional Milan coach Fabio Capello breaking down in tears.\nInternational career.\nOn 7 September 1983, Van Basten debuted for the Netherlands national football team during a UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying against Iceland.\nAt UEFA Euro 1988, Van Basten played a pivotal role in the Dutch team's victorious campaign. He scored a total of five goals, including a hat-trick against England in the first round, the winning goal in the semi-final against West Germany, and a spectacular volley from an acute angle in the 2\u20130 final against the Soviet Union, during which he also provided the assist for Gullit's opening goal. He finished the competition as the top scorer and was named player of the tournament. He was also included in team of the tournament. In a 2002 UK poll, Van Basten's volley against the Soviet Union was ranked #21 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.\nThe Dutch national team exited the 1990 World Cup early, losing 2\u20131 to eventual champions West Germany in the second round. Van Basten never scored in the World Cup finals. At UEFA Euro 1992, the Netherlands defeated reigning World Champions Germany 3\u20131 in the first round to top their group and reach the semi-finals, where they surprisingly lost to the eventual champions Denmark in a penalty shoot-out, with Peter Schmeichel saving a penalty shot from Van Basten. Although he went scoreless throughout the tournament, he was included in team of the tournament for the second time in 1992.\nPlayer profile.\nStyle of play.\nRegarded as one of the greatest and most complete strikers and players in the history of the sport, due to his prolific goalscoring and great skill set, Van Basten was dubbed the \"Swan of Utrecht\" for his elegance, attacking play and penchant for scoring acrobatic goals. His height and strength allowed him to excel in the air, and his technical ability and agility saw him execute spectacular strikes throughout his career, such as volleys and bicycle kicks. A fast and opportunistic striker with quick reactions and excellent movement, he often took advantage of loose balls in the penalty area due to his ability to anticipate defenders, and was capable of both controlling fast and difficult balls well with one touch, or even shooting first time. Possessing a powerful and accurate shot, and clinical, varied finishing from anywhere along the pitch, he was capable of scoring goals with either foot from inside or outside the penalty area, as well as with his head; he was also an accurate penalty kick and free-kick taker. Throughout his career, Van Basten converted 53 penalties out of the 57 he took, with a 93.0% success rate, the sixth highest in history, behind Ledio Pano (100%), Matthew Le Tissier (97.9%), Zico (97.8%), Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco (97.3%), and Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s (96.7%). Before taking penalties, Van Basten often used to perform a characteristic hop.\nAlthough he was mainly known as a traditional attacker who operated in the penalty area as a centre-forward throughout his career, Van Basten also possessed excellent vision and distribution, in addition to his goalscoring ability, which enabled him to play in deeper, more creative positions, as a second striker, for example, and which allowed him to participate in the build-up of attacking plays and provide assists to his teammates in addition to scoring goals himself; one of his most notable assists was the one he provided to Frank Rijkaard for Milan's winning goal in the 1990 European Cup final against Benfica. Despite his large stature, Van Basten possessed excellent technical skills and ball control, as well as good balance and a notable elegance on the ball, which inspired his nickname. As such, his strong physique, combined with his close control, also enabled him to hold up the ball for teammates when playing with his back to goal.\nDespite his ability, Van Basten's career was severely affected by many grave injuries, which eventually forced him to retire from football prematurely at the age of 28. Lack of protection from referees and inadequate football rules against rugged defending and tackles from behind were identified as the source of the injuries which ultimately led to his career's demise; consequently, Van Basten's early retirement due to his injuries led to widespread debate in the football world over whether rash challenges from behind should be rendered illegal in football, in order to protect talented players more effectively. During the 1994 World Cup, an automatic red was also shown for tackles from behind or with studs showing. In 1998, prior to the World Cup that year, FIFA completely outlawed the tackle from behind; this ruling came to be known colloquially as the \"Van Basten law\" in the media. Although Van Basten was known for often being on the receiving end of hard challenges from his opponents throughout his career, former referee Daniele Tombolini described Van Basten as a player who was known for his physical play himself, and who utilised his strength and committed a lot of fouls during matches.\nReception and legacy.\nConsidered by pundits to be one of the greatest and most complete players of all time, in 1998, Van Basten was ranked sixth in the FIFA Player of the Century internet poll, tenth in the European player of the Century election held by the IFFHS, and 12th in the IFFHS World Player of the Century election. He was also ranked eighth in a poll to determine \"France Football\"'s \"Football Player of the Century.\" In 1999, Van Basten was named the ninth greatest player of the twentieth Century by \"World Soccer\" magazine. In 2004, he was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100, his list of the world's 125 greatest living players, and also placed fourth in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll, celebrating the best European footballers of the past fifty years. He was also ranked 25th in a poll for the 100 greatest Dutch people. In 2007, \"Sky Sports\" ranked Van Basten first on its list of great athletes who had their careers cut short. In 2016 Van Basten was included in UEFA's All-time Euro XI, while in 2017, he was named the 13th greatest player of all time by \"FourFourTwo\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"It is between Rom\u00e1rio and Van Basten.\"\n\u2014 Diego Maradona on who was the best player he ever saw.\nNumerous players, managers, and other footballing figures have also lauded Van Basten as one of the greatest players of all time. In 1994, defender Pietro Vierchowod described Van Basten as \"the absolute number one\" and as a \"superstar,\" also adding that \"he is strong with his head, good with either foot, capable of changing the face of a game with a single play or, [even] when he is not at his best, of becoming the best assist-provider for his teammates.\" Former defender J\u00fcrgen Kohler, who often faced Van Basten throughout his career, described him as \"a player with exceptional abilities. He was a big personality not only as a sportsman, but also as a private person. I benefited from him. It is as simple as this. He was a big milestone in my career and for me he is one of the players who are the most outstanding personalities of the last century. Not only in sports, also as a human being.\" When asked of their duels, he commented: \"the duels between us were simply tough with everything football offers. He stood and I delivered and then I stood and he delivered.\"\nFormer Arsenal player Tony Adams described Van Basten as the toughest and most difficult opponent he had ever faced in 2006, stating: \"He\u2019s the quickest 6 ft 3 in centre-forward I\u2019ve ever seen! Just awesome. He was as quick as Ian Wright, as good in the air as Joe Jordan and he held the ball up better than Alan Smith. I put him in front of Maradona. Technically, Maradona was brilliant and he had amazing feet, but [V]an Basten could head, volley \u2013 he had power and strength.\" Fellow former defender Giuseppe Bergomi also described Van Basten as the strongest player he ever faced in 2018, commenting: \"The best player of all time for me [...] is Maradona, but the strongest player I ever faced was [V]an Basten because at least I could beat Maradona to the ball with my head.\"\nIn 2017, two of Van Basten's former Milan teammates, Demetrio Albertini and Marco Simone, labelled the Dutchman as the best player they had ever played with, with the former stating, \"The best player I have ever played with is Van Basten, the best overall. He had elegance and strength. He stopped playing at only 28 years of age, which is truly young.\" That same year, another one of his fellow former Milan teammates, Paolo Maldini, labelled Van Basten as the most complete player with whom he had ever played. Another former Milan teammate of Van Basten, Giovanni Cornacchini, described the Dutch striker as the greatest player of all time in 2019. Former Milan Vice-Chairman and CEO Adriano Galliani instead described Van Basten as Milan's greatest player ever in 2018. In 2017, Roberto Baggio named Van Basten as the player with whom he would have most liked to have played, commenting: \"I'd have liked to play with him. He's the player that I exchanged shirts with most willingly.\"\nIn 2019, former Milan coach Fabio Capello described Van Basten and Ronaldo as the best players he ever coached. His predecessor at Milan, Arrigo Sacchi, described Van Basten as the best striker of all time in 2014, commenting: \"Marco van Basten remains for me the best striker of all time. No other forward has worked as hard for the team as Marco did at Milan. I above all remember him for his elegance, his grace and his incredible quality.\" When Hern\u00e1n Crespo was asked in 2015 who was the greatest centre-forward of all time, he echoed Sacchi's views, responding: \"Marco van Basten. He did everything: dribbling, shooting, headers, acrobatics. And he played with his team and for his team.\" In 2019, Antonio Cassano described Van Basten and Ronaldo as the best forwards in the history of the game.\nManagerial career.\nJoining Ajax.\nVan Basten officially left Milan in 1995 and retired from football, stating he would never try management. However, he changed his mind and took a course with the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB). His first stint as a manager was as an assistant to his former teammate John van 't Schip with the second team of Ajax in 2003\u201304.\nNetherlands.\nOn 29 July 2004, Van Basten was named the new manager of the Netherlands national team, with Van 't Schip as his assistant. Van Basten's appointment as manager of the Netherlands sparked a little controversy at the time, since he only just started his managerial career and the media argued that he did not have a lot of experience yet.\nAfter UEFA Euro 2004, veterans Frank de Boer and Jaap Stam retired from international football, while Michael Reiziger retired after being left out of Van Basten's first squad. Van Basten also omitted Ruud van Nistelrooy from that squad, as the striker was suspended for the first two games of 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification and Van Basten only wanted to use players eligible for those games. His debut on 18 August was a 2\u20132 draw away to Sweden. Van Basten dropped more experienced players such as Roy Makaay, Clarence Seedorf, Patrick Kluivert and Edgar Davids, while sending several inexperienced AZ players to the World Cup, including Joris Mathijsen, Denny Landzaat and Kew Jaliens. Several veterans, including Edwin van der Sar, Phillip Cocu and Mark van Bommel, did make the squad. His team went unbeaten in their first 16 games until losing a friendly 3\u20131 at home to Italy on 12 November 2005.\nThe Netherlands were widely tipped to do well at the 2006 World Cup, having achieved the highest points average of any team in qualification, as well as breaking their reputation for in-fighting, and having a short journey to the finals in Germany. The team were in Group C, considered the Group of death by international media for also containing Argentina, Ivory Coast and Serbia &amp; Montenegro, the last of whom conceded only one goal in qualification. The Netherlands were eliminated in a 1\u20130 loss to Portugal in the Round of 16, with both teams receiving two red cards each.\nIn November 2006, Van Basten recalled Seedorf for a friendly against England at the Amsterdam Arena. He denied allegations that he had caved in to media pressure to name Seedorf in place of the injured Wesley Sneijder. In May 2007, Van Basten announced the end of his long-running dispute with Van Nistelrooy, who had previously declared never to play for a Dutch national squad with Van Basten as its manager.\nVan Basten had a contract with the KNVB for managing the Dutch national side until 2008. The KNVB had expressed its wishes to extend his contract to include the World Cup qualification route to 2010 World Cup in South Africa. On 22 February 2008, Van Basten signed a four-year contract with Ajax, starting from 1 July. His UEFA Euro 2008 selection was marred by Seedorf refusing to join the 30-man provisional squad unless Van Basten resigned, with Van Bommel having already made the same ultimatum.\nAt the tournament in Austria and Switzerland, the Netherlands beat world champions Italy 3\u20130 in their first match, followed by a 4\u20131 win over World Cup runners-up France. In their third match, having already qualified for the next round, Van Basten selected non-regulars such as Maarten Stekelenburg, Wilfred Bouma and Ibrahim Afellay for the starting lineup against Romania, a match the \"Oranje\" won 2\u20130. In the quarter-finals, Van Basten faced fellow Dutchman Guus Hiddink's Russia. With the score at 1\u20131 after 90 minutes, Hiddink and Russia went on to win the match 3\u20131 in extra-time. He finished his reign with a record of 35 wins, 11 draws and six losses in 52 matches.\nReturn to Ajax.\nVan Basten became manager of Ajax after Euro 2008 but resigned on 6 May 2009 after his team failed to qualify for the Champions League. Van Basten started the season well, having spent millions on players such as Miralem Sulejmani, Isma\u00efl Aissati, Dar\u00edo Cvitanich, Evander Sno, Eyong Enoh and Oleguer. However, in the second half of the season, striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar left for Real Madrid, and Van Basten started switching around his lineups. When Ajax lost 11 points in four matches, the Eredivisie title was out of sight. However, Ajax still had the chance to finish in second place, which would have ensured a place in the third qualifying round of the Champions League. Two important losses against PSV (6\u20132) and Sparta Rotterdam (4\u20130), however, ensured that Van Basten's Ajax could only finish third in the league. Van Basten decided to resign as Ajax manager at the end of the 2008\u201309 season. Van Basten subsequently became a pundit for Sport1, but was still planning to return as a manager. He finished his reign with a record of 26 wins, 8 draws and 11 losses in 45 matches.\nHeerenveen.\nOn 13 February 2012, it was announced that Van Basten would become the manager of Eredivisie club Heerenveen in the 2012\u201313 season. Van Basten led Heerenveen to an eighth-place finish in the 2012\u201313 year campaign. He then led them to a fifth-place finish the following season, during the 2013\u201314 campaign. He finished his reign with a record of 27 wins, 18 draws and 27 losses in 72 matches.\nAZ.\nAZ Alkmaar announced on 18 April 2014 that Van Basten would replace Dick Advocaat at the start of the 2014\u201315 season. On 28 August 2014, Van Basten took a leave of absence for the following match against Dordrecht, with multiple Dutch news outlets reporting he was suffering of stress-related heart palpitations, and was replaced by assistant coaches Alex Pastoor and Dennis Haar. Later, on 3 September, AZ confirmed that Van Basten was given an extended leave of absence until 14 September. On 16 September 2014, parties agreed Van Basten would relinquish his role as manager in order to sign a new contract as assistant coach until 2016; this was motivated by Van Basten himself, who stated the stress caused by his full-time role as head coach was causing him physical and mental issues. He finished his stint with two wins and three losses in five matches.\nFIFA technical director.\nAfter a year at AZ, Van Basten decided to take up the vacant post of assistant coach under the new head coach of the Netherlands national team, Danny Blind. Van Basten would work together with fellow assistant coach Ruud van Nistelrooy, whom Van Basten had initially sent away when he was head coach of the Netherlands. In August 2016, Van Basten announced he would be leaving the role to take up a position at FIFA as technical director.\nIn March 2018, Van Basten travelled to Iran with FIFA president Gianni Infantino to mark 100 years of the Iran Football Federation. After meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani they were welcomed by the president of Iranian Football Federation Mehdi Taj at the Tehran Olympic Hotel. Attending the Tehran Derby, Van Basten called for the ban on women entering sports venues to be lifted.\nAfter retirement.\nVan Basten played in the Demetrio Albertini testimonial match at the San Siro in March 2006, and headed in a goal before being substituted early in the first half. On 22 July 2006, he also returned for the testimonial match to celebrate the 11-year Arsenal career of Dennis Bergkamp, in what was the first match played at the new Emirates Stadium. He played in the second half for the Ajax legends team. He entered the match as part of a double substitution that also introduced Johan Cruyff. He took part in Tyskie's (a Polish beer company) advertising campaign with Lu\u00eds Figo and Zbigniew Boniek.\nMedia and sponsorship.\nVan Basten features in EA Sports' \"FIFA\" video game series, and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in \"FIFA 14\". Throughout his playing career, Van Basten was sponsored by Italian sportswear company Diadora. One of the most marketable players in the world, in the late 1980s Diadora launched his own personalized football boots, the San Siro Van Basten, earning him two million dollars over 5 years.\nAfter his retirement from coaching, Van Basten became an analyst, and was described by ESPN in 2016 as a \"rather cerebral\" analyst who \"ponders the problems of FIFA and suggests changes to the offside rule.\" On 23 November 2019, while Van Basten was working as an analyst for the Dutch edition of the Fox Sports network, he said \"Sieg Heil\" (meaning \"Hail victory\" in German), a verbal salutation associated with the Nazi salute, during a live broadcast. Van Basten stated that he believed his microphone was off when he made the remark, and that it was in response to his colleague Hans Kraay's interview with Heracles's German manager, Frank Wormuth, following the team's 4\u20131 loss to Ajax. Van Basten said: \"It wasn't my intention to shock people, I apologise. I just wanted to make a comment about Hans' German. It was an ill-placed joke.\" His use of the term attracted particular controversy as it occurred on a weekend during which Dutch football clubs were observing a minute of silence prior to matches in protest against discrimination. Following the incident, the network described Van Basten's comment as \"stupid and inappropriate,\" and suspended him until 7 December. Electronic Arts also announced that Van Basten's cards in FIFA Ultimate Team would no longer be available in FIFA 20 stating the company has \"an expectation that our commitment to quality and diversity is upheld.\" However he has returned to FIFA 21.\nCareer statistics.\nClub.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Scores and results list the Netherlands' goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Van Basten goal.\"\n \"As of 16 September 2014.\"\nManagerial statistics.\nInternational matches.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Win\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Draw\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Loss\nHonours.\nAjax\nAC Milan\nNetherlands\nIndividual\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The common name plantain is shared with the unrelated cooking plantain. Most are herbaceous plants, though a few are subshrubs growing to tall.\nDescription.\nThe leaves are sessile or have a poorly defined petiole. They have three or five parallel veins that diverge in the wider part of the leaf. Leaves are broad or narrow, depending on the species. The inflorescences are borne on stalks typically tall, and can be a short cone or a long spike, with numerous tiny wind-pollinated flowers.\nSpecies.\nThe boundaries of the genus \"Plantago\" have been fairly stable, with the main question being whether to include \"Bougueria\" (one species from the Andes) and \"Littorella\" (2\u20133 species of aquatic plants).\nThere are about 200 species of \"Plantago\", including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe genus name \"Plantago\" descends from the classical Latin name , which in classical Latin meant some \"Plantago\" species, including \"Plantago major\" and \"Plantago media\". In Latin the name was formed from the classical Latin word = \"sole of the foot\". The name was so formed in Latin because the leaves of these species grow out near flat at ground level. The suffix in Latin means \"a sort of\".\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe species are found all over the world, including the Americas, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa and Europe. Many species in the genus are cosmopolitan weeds. They are found in many different habitats, most commonly in wet areas like seepages or bogs. They can also be found in alpine and semi-alpine or coastal areas. The cosmopolitan weeds can be frequently seen at the side of roads.\nEcology.\nPlantains are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth).\nUses.\nPlantain has been consumed as human food since prehistory. For example, archaeological recovery along California's Central Coast has demonstrated use of this species as a food since the Millingstone Horizon. The broad-leaved varieties are sometimes used as a leaf vegetable for salads, green sauce, and so on. Tender young plantain leaves can be eaten raw and older leaves can be cooked. The seeds can be cooked like rice.\n\"Plantago\" species have been used since prehistoric times as herbal remedies. The herb is astringent, anti-toxic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-histamine, as well as demulcent, expectorant, styptic and diuretic. Externally, a poultice of the leaves is useful for insect bites, poison-ivy rashes, minor sores, and boils. In folklore it is even claimed to be able to cure snakebite and was used by the Dakota tribe of North America for this. Internally, it is used for coughs and bronchitis, as a tea, tincture, or syrup. Tea made from the leaves may help cure diarrhea.\nPlantain seed husks expand and become mucilaginous when wet, especially those of \"P.\u00a0psyllium\", which is used in common over-the-counter bulk laxative and fiber supplement products such as Metamucil. \"P.\u00a0psyllium\" seed is useful for constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, dietary fiber supplementation, and diverticular disease. Mucilage from desert indianwheat (\"P.\u00a0ovata\") is obtained by grinding off the husk. This mucilage, also known as psyllium, is commonly sold as Isabgol, a laxative which is used to control irregular bowel syndrome and constipation. It has been used as an indigenous Ayurvedic and Unani medicine for a whole range of bowel problems. Psyllium supplements are typically used in powder form, along with adequate amounts of fluids. A dose of at least 7\u00a0grams daily taken with adequate amounts of fluid (water, juice) is used by some for management of elevated cholesterol. There are a number of psyllium products used for constipation. The usual dose is about 3.5\u00a0grams twice a day. Psyllium is also a component of several ready-to-eat cereals.\nIn Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia, leaves from \"Plantago major\" are used as a folk remedy to preventing infection on cuts and scratches because of its antiseptic properties. In Slovenia and other Central European regions, the leaves were traditionally used topically as a cure for blisters resulting from friction (such as caused by tight shoes etc.).\nThere may also be a use for plantains in the abatement of enteric methane from ruminants, as the natural compounds present (e.g. condensed tannins; ~14\u00a0g/kg DM), affect the acetate-propionate ratio in the rumen, which is a primary mechanism by which methanogenesis is restricted. Currently this is not a viable option in any significant scale due to agronomic difficulties.\nCulture.\nAs Old English \"Wegbrade\" the plantago is one of the nine plants invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon \"Nine Herbs Charm\", recorded in the 10th century.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A poetic triplet is a tercet in which all three lines follow the same rhyme, formula_1; triplets are rather rare; they are more customarily used sparingly in verse of heroic couplets or other couplet verse, to add extraordinary emphasis.\nOther types of tercet include an enclosed tercet where the lines rhyme in an formula_2 pattern and terza rima where the formula_2 pattern of a verse is continued in the next verse by making the outer lines of the next stanza rhyme with the central line of the preceding stanza, formula_4, as in the \"terza rima\" or \"terzina\" form of Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\". There has been much investigation of the possible sources of the Dantesque \"terzina\", which Benedetto Croce characterised as \"linked, enclosed, disciplined, vehement and yet calm\". William Baer observes of the tercets of terza rima, \"These interlocking rhymes tend to pull the listener's attention forward in a continuous flow... Given this natural tendency to glide forward, terza rima is especially well-suited to narration and description\".\nThe tercet also forms part of the villanelle, where the initial five stanzas are tercets, followed by a concluding quatrain.\nA tercet may also form the separate halves of the ending sestet in a Petrarchan sonnet, where the rhyme scheme is formula_5, as in Longfellow's \"Cross of Snow\". For example, while \"Cross of Snow\" is indeed a Petrarchan sonnet, it does not follow the form offormula_6. Instead, its form is formula_7. A tercet also ends sestinas where the keywords of the lines before are repeated in a highly ordered form.\nHistory.\nTercets (or \"tristichs\") using parallelism appear in Biblical Hebrew poetry.\nThe tercet was introduced into English poetry by Sir Thomas Wyatt in the 16th century. It was employed by Shelley and is the form used in Byron's \"The Prophecy of Dante\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It frequently results in and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It also often results in an enlarged thyroid. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, poor tolerance of heat, diarrhea and unintentional weight loss. Other symptoms may include thickening of the skin on the shins, known as pretibial myxedema, and eye bulging, a condition caused by Graves' ophthalmopathy. About 25 to 30% of people with the condition develop eye problems.\nThe exact cause of the disease is unclear, but symptoms are a result of antibodies binding to receptors on the thyroid, causing over-expression of thyroid hormone. Persons are more likely to be affected if they have a family member with the disease. If one monozygotic twin is affected, a 30% chance exists that the other twin will also have the disease. The onset of disease may be triggered by physical or emotional stress, infection, or giving birth. Those with other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, are more likely to be affected. Smoking increases the risk of disease and may worsen eye problems. The disorder results from an antibody, called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), that has a similar effect to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). These TSI antibodies cause the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormones. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with blood tests and radioiodine uptake. Typically, blood tests show a raised T3 and T4, low TSH, increased radioiodine uptake in all areas of the thyroid, and TSI antibodies.\nThe three treatment options are radioiodine therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy involves taking iodine-131 by mouth, which is then concentrated in the thyroid and destroys it over weeks to months. The resulting hypothyroidism is treated with synthetic thyroid hormones. Medications such as beta blockers may control some of the symptoms, and antithyroid medications such as methimazole may temporarily help people, while other treatments are having an effect. Surgery to remove the thyroid is another option. Eye problems may require additional treatments.\nGraves' disease develops in about 0.5% of males and 3.0% of females. It occurs about 7.5 times more often in women than in men. Often, it starts between the ages of 40 and 60, but can begin at any age. It is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States (about 50 to 80% of cases). The condition is named after Irish surgeon Robert Graves, who described it in 1835. Many prior descriptions also exist.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe signs and symptoms of Graves' disease virtually all result from the direct and indirect effects of hyperthyroidism, with the main exceptions being Graves ophthalmopathy, goiter, and pretibial myxedema (which are caused by the autoimmune processes of the disease). Symptoms of the resultant hyperthyroidism are mainly insomnia, hand tremor, hyperactivity, hair loss, excessive sweating, oligomenorrhea, itching, heat intolerance, weight loss despite increased appetite, diarrhea, frequent defecation, palpitations, periodic partial muscle weakness or paralysis in those especially of Asian descent, and skin warmth and moistness. Further signs that may be seen on physical examination are most commonly a diffusely enlarged (usually symmetric), nontender thyroid, lid lag, excessive lacrimation due to Graves' ophthalmopathy, arrhythmias of the heart, such as sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions, and hypertension.\nCause.\nThe exact cause is unclear, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While a theoretical mechanism occurs by which exposure to severe stressors and high levels of subsequent distress such as post-traumatic stress disorder could increase the risk of immune disease and cause an aggravation of the autoimmune response that leads to Graves disease, more robust clinical data are needed for a firm conclusion.\nGenetics.\nA genetic predisposition for Graves' disease is seen, with some people more prone to develop TSH receptor-activating antibodies due to a genetic cause. Human leukocyte antigen DR (especially DR3) appears to play a role. To date, no clear genetic defect has been found to point to a single-gene cause.\nGenes believed to be involved include those for thyroglobulin, thyrotropin receptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (\"PTPN22\"), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated antigen 4, among others.\nInfectious trigger.\nSince Graves disease is an autoimmune disease that appears suddenly, often later in life, a viral or bacterial infection may trigger antibodies, which cross-react with the human TSH receptor, a phenomenon known as antigenic mimicry.\nThe bacterium \"Yersinia enterocolitica\" bears structural similarity with the human thyrotropin receptor and was hypothesized to contribute to the development of thyroid autoimmunity arising from other reasons in genetically susceptible individuals.\nIn the 1990s, \"Y. enterocolitica\" was suggested to be possibly associated with Graves' disease.\nMore recently, the role of \"Y. enterocolitica\" has been disputed.\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus is another potential trigger.\nMechanism.\nThyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins recognize and bind to the TSH receptor, which stimulates the secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroxine receptors in the pituitary gland are activated by the surplus hormone, suppressing additional release of TSH in a negative feedback loop. The result is very high levels of circulating thyroid hormones and a low TSH level.\nPathophysiology.\nGraves' disease is an autoimmune disorder, in which the body produces antibodies that are specific to a self-protein - the receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone. (Antibodies to thyroglobulin and the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 may also be produced.)\nThese antibodies cause hyperthyroidism because they bind to the TSHr and chronically stimulate it. The TSHr is expressed on the thyroid follicular cells of the thyroid gland (the cells that produce thyroid hormone), and the result of chronic stimulation is an abnormally high production of T3 and T4. This, in turn, causes the clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism, and the enlargement of the thyroid gland is visible as a goiter.\nThe infiltrative exophthalmos frequently encountered has been explained by postulating that the thyroid gland and the extraocular muscles share a common antigen, which is recognized by the antibodies. Antibodies binding to the extraocular muscles would cause swelling behind the eyeball.\nThe \"orange peel\" skin has been explained by the infiltration of antibodies under the skin, causing an inflammatory reaction and subsequent fibrous plaques.\nThe three types of autoantibodies to the TSH receptor are:\nAnother effect of hyperthyroidism is bone loss from osteoporosis, caused by an increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus in the urine and stool. The effects can be minimized if the hyperthyroidism is treated early. Thyrotoxicosis can also augment calcium levels in the blood by as much as 25%. This can cause stomach upset, excessive urination, and impaired kidney function.\nDiagnosis.\nGraves' disease may present clinically with one or more of these characteristic signs:\nTwo signs are truly diagnostic of Graves' disease (i.e., not seen in other hyperthyroid conditions): exophthalmos and non-pitting edema (pretibial myxedema). Goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland and is of the diffuse type (i.e., spread throughout the gland). Diffuse goiter may be seen with other causes of hyperthyroidism, although Graves' disease is the most common cause of diffuse goiter. A large goiter will be visible to the naked eye, but a small one (mild enlargement of the gland) may be detectable only by physical examination. Occasionally, goiter is not clinically detectable, but may be seen only with computed tomography or ultrasound examination of the thyroid. Another sign of Graves' disease is hyperthyroidism, that is, overproduction of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Normal thyroid levels are also seen, and occasionally hypothyroidism, which may assist in causing goiter (though it is not the cause of Graves' disease). Hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of hyperthyroidism, by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T4.\nOther useful laboratory measurements in Graves' disease include thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, usually undetectable in Graves' disease due to negative feedback from the elevated T3 and T4), and protein-bound iodine (elevated). Serologically detected thyroid-stimulating antibodies, radioactive iodine uptake, or thyroid ultrasound with Doppler, all can independently confirm a diagnosis of Graves' disease.\nBiopsy to obtain histological testing is not normally required, but may be obtained if thyroidectomy is performed.\nThe goiter in Graves' disease is often not nodular, but thyroid nodules are also common. Differentiating common forms of hyperthyroidism, such as Graves' disease, single thyroid adenoma, and toxic multinodular goiter is important to determine proper treatment. The differentiation among these entities has advanced, as imaging and biochemical tests have improved. Measuring TSH-receptor antibodies with the h-TBII assay has been proven efficient and was the most practical approach found in one study.\nEye disease.\nThyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), or thyroid eye disease (TED), is the most common extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease. It is a form of idiopathic lymphocytic orbital inflammation, and although its pathogenesis is not completely understood, autoimmune activation of orbital fibroblasts, which in TAO express the TSH receptor, is thought to play a central role.\nHypertrophy of the extraocular muscles, adipogenesis, and deposition of nonsulfated glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronate, causes expansion of the orbital fat and muscle compartments, which within the confines of the bony orbit may lead to dysthyroid optic neuropathy, increased intraocular pressures, proptosis, venous congestion leading to chemosis and periorbital edema, and progressive remodeling of the orbital walls. Other distinctive features of TAO include lid retraction, restrictive myopathy, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, and exposure keratopathy.\nSeverity of eye disease may be classified by the mnemonic: \"NO SPECS\":\nTypically, the natural history of TAO follows Rundle's curve, which describes a rapid worsening during an initial phase, up to a peak of maximum severity, and then improvement to a static plateau without, however, resolving back to a normal condition.\nManagement.\nTreatment of Graves' disease includes antithyroid drugs that reduce the production of thyroid hormone, radioiodine (radioactive iodine I-131), and thyroidectomy (surgical excision of the gland). As operating on a hyperthyroid patient is dangerous, before thyroidectomy, preoperative treatment with antithyroid drugs is given to render the patient euthyroid. Each of these treatments has advantages and disadvantages, and no single treatment approach is considered the best for everyone.\nTreatment with antithyroid medications must be administered for six months to two years to be effective. Even then, upon cessation of the drugs, the hyperthyroid state may recur. The risk of recurrence is about 40\u201350%, and lifelong treatment with antithyroid drugs carries some side effects such as agranulocytosis and liver disease. Side effects of the antithyroid medications include a potentially fatal reduction in the level of white blood cells. Therapy with radioiodine is the most common treatment in the United States, while antithyroid drugs and/or thyroidectomy are used more often in Europe, Japan, and most of the rest of the world.\n\u03b2-Blockers (such as propranolol) may be used to inhibit the sympathetic nervous system symptoms of tachycardia and nausea until antithyroid treatments begin to take effect. Pure \u03b2-blockers do not inhibit lid retraction in the eyes, which is mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors.\nAntithyroid drugs.\nThe main antithyroid drugs are carbimazole (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. These drugs block the binding of iodine and the coupling of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU). Others include granulocytopenia (dose-dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia. Patients on these medications should see a doctor if they develop a sore throat or fever. The most common side effects are rash and peripheral neuritis. These drugs also cross the placenta and are secreted in breast milk. Lugol's iodine may be used to block hormone synthesis before surgery.\nA randomized control trial testing single-dose treatment for Graves found methimazole achieved euthyroid state more effectively after 12 weeks than did propylthiouracil (77.1% on methimazole 15\u00a0mg vs 19.4% in the propylthiouracil 150\u00a0mg groups).\nNo difference in outcome was shown for adding thyroxine to antithyroid medication and continuing thyroxine versus placebo after antithyroid medication withdrawal. However, two markers were found that can help predict the risk of recurrence. These two markers are a positive TSHr antibody (TSHR-Ab) and smoking. A positive TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment increases the risk of recurrence to 90% (sensitivity 39%, specificity 98%), and a negative TSHR-Ab at the end of antithyroid drug treatment is associated with a 78% chance of remaining in remission. Smoking was shown to have an impact independent of a positive TSHR-Ab.\nRadioiodine.\nRadioiodine (radioactive iodine-131) was developed in the early 1940s at the Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center. This modality is suitable for most patients, although some prefer to use it mainly for older patients. Indications for radioiodine are failed medical therapy or surgery, and where medical or surgical therapy is contraindicated. Hypothyroidism may be a complication of this therapy, but it may be treated with thyroid hormones if it appears. The rationale for radioactive iodine is that it accumulates in the thyroid and irradiates the gland with its beta and gamma radiations, about 90% of the total radiation being emitted by the beta (electron) particles. The most common method of iodine-131 treatment is to administer a specified amount in microcuries per gram of thyroid gland based on palpation or radiodiagnostic imaging of the gland over 24 hours. Patients who receive the therapy must be monitored regularly with thyroid blood tests to ensure they are treated with thyroid hormone before they become symptomatically hypothyroid.\nContraindications to RAI are pregnancy (absolute), ophthalmopathy (relative; it can aggravate thyroid eye disease), or solitary nodules.\nDisadvantages of this treatment are a high incidence of hypothyroidism (up to 80%) requiring eventual thyroid hormone supplementation in the form of a daily pill(s). The radioiodine treatment acts slowly (over months to years) to destroy the thyroid gland, and Graves' disease\u2013associated hyperthyroidism is not cured in all persons by radioiodine, but has a relapse rate that depends on the dose of radioiodine which is administered. In rare cases, radiation induced thyroiditis has been linked to this treatment.\nSurgery.\nThis modality is suitable for young people and pregnant females. Indications for thyroidectomy can be separated into absolute indications or relative indications. These indications help decide who would benefit most from surgery. The absolute indications are a large goiter (especially when compressing the trachea), suspicious nodules or suspected cancer (to pathologically examine the thyroid), and people with ophthalmopathy and additionally if it is the person's preferred method of treatment or if refusing to undergo radioactive iodine treatment. Pregnancy is advised to be delayed for six months after radioactive iodine treatment.\nBoth bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy and the Hartley-Dunhill procedure (hemithyroidectomy on one side and partial lobectomy on the other side) are possible.\nAdvantages are immediate cure and potential removal of carcinoma. Its risks are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, hypoparathyroidism (due to removal of the parathyroid glands), hematoma (which can be life-threatening if it compresses the trachea), relapse following medical treatment, infections (less common), and scarring. The increase in the risk of nerve injury can be due to the increased vascularity of the thyroid parenchyma and the development of links between the thyroid capsule and the surrounding tissues. Reportedly, a 1% incidence exists of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis after complete thyroidectomy. Risks related to anesthesia are many; thus, coordination with the anesthesiologist and patient optimization for surgery preoperatively are essential. Removal of the gland enables a complete biopsy to be performed to have definite evidence of cancer anywhere in the thyroid. (Needle biopsies are not so accurate at predicting a benign state of the thyroid.) No further treatment of the thyroid is required, unless cancer is detected. A radioiodine uptake study may be done after surgery to ensure all remaining (potentially cancerous) thyroid cells (i.e., near the nerves to the vocal cords) are destroyed. Besides this, the only remaining treatment will be levothyroxine, or thyroid replacement pills to be taken for the rest of the patient's life.\nA 2013 review article concludes that surgery appears to be the most successful in the management of Graves' disease, with total thyroidectomy being the preferred surgical option.\nEyes.\nMild cases are treated with lubricant eye drops or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drops. Severe cases threatening vision (corneal exposure or optic nerve compression) are treated with steroids or orbital decompression. In all cases, cessation of smoking is essential. Double vision can be corrected with prism glasses and surgery (the latter only when the process has been stable for a while).\nDifficulty closing eyes can be treated with lubricant gel at night or with tape on the eyes to enable full, deep sleep.\nOrbital decompression can be performed to enable bulging eyes to retreat into the head. Bone is removed from the skull behind the eyes, and space is made for the muscles and fatty tissue to fall back into the skull.\nFor management of clinically active Graves' disease, orbitopathy (clinical activity score &gt;2) with at least mild to moderate severity, intravenous glucocorticoids are the treatment of choice, usually administered in the form of pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. Studies have consistently shown that pulse intravenous methylprednisolone is superior to oral glucocorticoids both in terms of efficacy and decreased side effects for managing Graves' orbitopathy.\nPrognosis.\nIf left untreated, more serious complications could result, including birth defects in pregnancy, increased risk of a miscarriage, bone mineral loss and, in extreme cases, death (e.g. indirectly through complications, or through a thyroid storm event). Graves' disease is often accompanied by an increase in heart rate, which may lead to further heart complications, including loss of the normal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), which may lead to stroke. If the eyes are proptotic (bulging) enough that the lids do not close completely at night, dryness will occur, with the risk of a secondary corneal infection, which could lead to blindness. Pressure on the optic nerve behind the globe can lead to visual field defects and vision loss, as well. Prolonged, untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss, which may resolve when treated.\nEpidemiology.\nGraves' disease occurs in about 0.5% of people. Graves' disease data has shown that the lifetime risk for women is around 3% and 0.5% for men. It occurs about 7.5 times more often in women than in men and often starts between the ages of 40 and 60. It is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States (about 50 to 80% of cases).\nHistory.\nGraves' disease owes its name to the Anglo-Irish doctor Robert James Graves, who described a case of goiter with exophthalmos in 1835. (Medical eponyms are often styled nonpossessively; thus \"Graves' disease\" and \"Graves disease\" are variant stylings of the same term.)\nThe German Karl Adolph von Basedow independently reported the same constellation of symptoms in 1840. As a result, on the European continent, the terms \"Basedow syndrome\", \"Basedow disease\", or \"Morbus Basedow\" are more common than \"Graves' disease\".\nGraves disease has also been called \"exophthalmic goiter\".\nLess commonly, it has been known as Parry disease, Begbie disease, Flajan disease, Flajani\u2013Basedow syndrome, and Marsh disease. These names for the disease were derived from Caleb Hillier Parry, James Begbie, Giuseppe Flajani, and Henry Marsh. Early reports, not widely circulated, of cases of goiter with exophthalmos were published by the Italians Giuseppe Flajani and Antonio Giuseppe Testa, in 1802 and 1810, respectively. Before these, Caleb Hillier Parry, a notable provincial physician in England of the late 18th century (and a friend of Edward Miller-Gallus), described a case in 1786. This case was not published until 1825 - ten years ahead of Graves.\nHowever, fair credit for the first description of Graves' disease goes to the 12th-century Persian physician Sayyid Ismail al-Jurjani, who noted the association of goiter and exophthalmos in his \"Thesaurus of the Shah of Khwarazm\", the major medical dictionary of its time.\nResearch.\nAgents that act as antagonists at thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors are under investigation as a possible treatment for Graves' disease.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On the contrary, bigger values, like 254 stored in fixed 8-bit size, would be codice_3 while the \u03b3-encoding variable-bit version would be codice_4, needing 7 extra bits.\nGamma coding is a building block in the Elias delta code.\nGeneralizations.\nGamma coding does not code zero or negative integers.\nOne way of handling zero is to add 1 before coding and then subtract 1 after decoding.\nAnother way is to prefix each nonzero code with a 1 and then code zero as a single 0.\nOne way to code all integers is to set up a bijection, mapping integers (0, \u22121, 1, \u22122, 2, \u22123, 3, ...) to (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...) before coding. In software, this is most easily done by mapping non-negative inputs to odd outputs, and negative inputs to even outputs, so the least-significant bit becomes an inverted sign bit:\nformula_13\nExponential-Golomb coding generalizes the gamma code to integers with a \"flatter\" power-law distribution, just as Golomb coding generalizes the unary code.\nIt involves dividing the number by a positive divisor, commonly a power of 2, writing the gamma code for one more than the quotient, and writing out the remainder in an ordinary binary code.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is bordered by the Bristol Channel, Bristol, and Gloucestershire to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east, and Devon to the south-west. The largest settlement is the city of Bath.\nSomerset is a predominantly rural county, especially to the south and west, with an area of and a population of 1,012,934 in 2024. Bath is located in the north-east of the county, Yeovil in the south-east, Taunton in the south-west, and the seaside resort of Weston-super-Mare in the north-west. The city of Wells, the second-smallest city by population in England, is located in the centre. For local government purposes, the county comprises three unitary authority areas: Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset, and Somerset. Bath and North East Somerset Council is a member of the West of England Combined Authority.\nThe centre of Somerset is dominated by the Levels, a coastal plain and wetland. The north-east contains part of the Cotswolds uplands and all of the Mendip Hills, which are both national landscapes; the west contains the Quantock Hills and part of the Blackdown Hills, which are also national landscapes, and most of Exmoor, a national park. The major rivers of the county are the Avon, which flows through Bath and then Bristol, and the Axe, Brue, and Parrett, which drain the Levels.\nThere is evidence of Paleolithic human occupation in Somerset, and the area was subsequently settled by the Celts, Romans and Anglo-Saxons. The county played a significant part in Alfred the Great's rise to power, and later the English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion. In the later medieval period, its wealth allowed its monasteries and parish churches to be rebuilt in grand style; Glastonbury Abbey was particularly important, and claimed to house the tomb of King Arthur and Guinevere. The city of Bath is famous for its Georgian architecture, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The county is also the location of Glastonbury Festival, one of the UK's major music festivals.\nToponymy.\nSomerset's name most likely derives from Old English , short for , meaning \"the people living at or dependent on \"Sumort\u016bn\"\u201d (now known as Somerton). An alternative suggestion is that the name derives from \"Seo-mere-saetan\" meaning \"settlers by the sea lakes\". The same ending can also be seen in the neighbouring Dorset. The first known use of \"Somers\u00e6te\" is in the law code of King Ine who was the Saxon King of Wessex from 688 to 726\u00a0CE, making Somerset along with Hampshire, Wiltshire and Dorset one of the oldest extant units of local government in the world.\nThe Old English name is used in the motto of the county, , meaning \"all the people of Somerset\". Adopted as the motto in 1911, the phrase is taken from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Somerset was a shire of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and the phrase refers to the wholehearted support the people of Somerset gave to King Alfred in his struggle to save Wessex from Viking invaders.\nSomerset settlement names are mostly Anglo-Saxon in origin (for example, Bath, Somerton, Wells and Keynsham), but numerous place names include British Celtic elements, such as the rivers Frome and Avon, and names of hills. For example, an Anglo-Saxon charter of 682 refers to Creechborough Hill as \"the hill which in the British language is \"Cructan\" and which to us is \"Crychbeorh\"\". Some modern names are wholly Brittonic in origin, like Tarnock, Priddy and Chard, while others have both Saxon and Brittonic elements, such as Pen Hill.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe caves of the Mendip Hills were settled during the Palaeolithic period, and contain extensive archaeological sites such as those at Cheddar Gorge. Bones from Gough's Cave have been dated to 12,000\u00a0BCE, and a complete skeleton, known as Cheddar Man, dates from 7150\u00a0BCE. Examples of cave art have been found in Aveline's Hole. Some caves continued to be occupied until modern times, including Wookey Hole.\nThe Somerset Levels\u2014specifically dry points at Glastonbury and Brent Knoll\u2014also have a long history of settlement, and are known to have been settled by Mesolithic hunters. Travel in the area was facilitated by the construction of one of the world's oldest known engineered roadways, the Sweet Track, which dates from 3807\u00a0BCE or 3806\u00a0BCE.\nThe exact age of the henge monument at Stanton Drew stone circles is unknown, but it is believed to be Neolithic. There are numerous Iron Age hill forts, some of which, like Cadbury Castle and Ham Hill, were later reoccupied in the Early Middle Ages.\nRoman invasion.\nOn the authority of the future emperor Vespasian, as part of the ongoing expansion of the Roman presence in Britain, the Second Legion Augusta invaded Somerset from the south-east in 47\u00a0CE. The county remained part of the Roman Empire until around 409\u00a0CE, when the Roman occupation of Britain came to an end.\nA variety of Roman remains have been found, including Pagans Hill Roman temple in Chew Stoke, Low Ham Roman Villa and the Roman Baths that gave their name to the city of Bath.\nSaxon and Norman invasions.\nAfter the Romans left, Britain was invaded by Anglo-Saxon peoples. By 600\u00a0CE they had established control over much of what is now England, but Somerset was still in native British hands. The British held back Saxon advance into the south-west for some time longer, but by the early eighth century King Ine of Wessex had pushed the boundaries of the West Saxon kingdom far enough west to include Somerset. The Saxon royal palace in Cheddar was used several times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot.\nThe nature of the relations between the Britons and the Saxons in Somerset is not entirely clear. Ine's laws demonstrate that the Britons were considered to be a significant enough population in Wessex to merit provisions; however, the laws also suggest that Britons could not attain the same social standing as the Saxons, and that many were slaves. In light of such policies, many Britons might have chosen to emigrate to places such as Brittany while those who remained would have had incentives to adopt Anglo-Saxon culture.\nAfter the Norman Conquest, the county was divided into 700\u00a0fiefs, and large areas were owned by the crown, with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence. Somerset came under the political influence of several different nobles during the Middle Ages. During the Wars of the Roses, an important magnate was Humphrey Stafford, earl of Devon, whose wider influence stretched from Cornwall to Wiltshire. After 1485, one of the county's most influential figures was Henry VII's chamberlain Giles Daubeney.\nThe 17th\u201319th\u00a0centuries.\nSomerset contains HM Prison Shepton Mallet, which was England's oldest prison still in use prior to its closure in 2013, having opened in 1610. During the English Civil War, Somerset was largely Parliamentarian, with key engagements being the Sieges of Taunton and the Battle of Langport.\nIn 1685, the Monmouth Rebellion was played out in Somerset and neighbouring Dorset. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and travelled north, hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, but they were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last pitched battle fought in England. Arthur Wellesley took his title, Duke of Wellington, from the town of Wellington; he is commemorated on a nearby hill by a large, spotlit obelisk, known as the Wellington Monument.\nThe Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelt the end for most of Somerset's cottage industries. Farming continued to flourish, and the Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures and Commerce was founded in 1777 to improve farming methods. Despite this, two decades later, agriculturist John Billingsley conducted a survey of the county's agriculture in 1795 and found that agricultural methods could still be improved.\nCoal mining was an important industry in north Somerset during the 18th and 19th\u00a0centuries, and by 1800 it was prominent in Radstock.\nThe Somerset Coalfield reached its peak production by the 1920s. All the pits have now been closed, the last in 1973. Most of the surface buildings have been removed, and apart from a winding wheel outside Radstock Museum, little evidence of their former existence remains. Further west, the Brendon Hills were mined for iron ore in the late 19th\u00a0century; this was taken by the West Somerset Mineral Railway to Watchet Harbour for shipment to the furnaces at Ebbw Vale.\n20th century.\nMany Somerset soldiers died during the First World War, with the Somerset Light Infantry suffering nearly 5,000\u00a0casualties. War memorials were put up in most of the county's towns and villages; only nine, described as the Thankful Villages, had none of their residents killed. During the Second World War, the county was a base for troops preparing for the D-Day landings. Some of the hospitals that were built for the casualties of the war remain in use. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to repel a potential German invasion. The remains of its pill boxes can still be seen along the coast, and south through Ilminster and Chard.\nA number of decoy towns were constructed in Somerset in World War\u00a0II to protect Bristol and other towns. They were designed to mimic the nighttime geometry of \"blacked out\" streets, railway lines, and Bristol Temple Meads railway station, to encourage German bombers away from these targets. One, on the German radio navigation beam flight path to Bristol, was constructed on Beacon Batch. It was laid out by Shepperton Studios, based on aerial photographs of the city's railway marshalling yards. The decoys were fitted with dim red lights, simulating activities such as the stoking of steam locomotives. Burning bales of straw soaked in creosote were used to simulate the effects of incendiary bombs dropped by the first wave of Pathfinder night bombers; meanwhile, incendiary bombs dropped on the correct location were quickly smothered, wherever possible. Drums of oil were also ignited to simulate the effect of a blazing city or town, with the aim of fooling subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs on the wrong location.\nThe Chew Magna decoy town was hit by half a dozen bombs on 2\u00a0December 1940, and over a thousand incendiaries on 3\u00a0January 1941. The following night the Uphill decoy town, protecting the airfield at Weston-super-Mare, was bombed; a herd of dairy cows was hit, killing some and severely injuring others.\nGeography.\nBoundaries.\nThe boundaries of Somerset are largely unaltered from medieval times. The main change has been in the north, where the River Avon formed the border with Gloucestershire, except that the hundred of Bath Forum, which straddles the Avon, formed part of Somerset. Bristol began as a town on the Gloucestershire side of the Avon, but as it grew, it extended across the river into Somerset. In 1373 Edward III proclaimed \"that the town of Bristol with its suburbs and precincts shall henceforth be separate from the counties of Gloucester and Somerset\u00a0... and that it should be a county by itself\".\nThe present-day northern border of Somerset (adjoining the counties of Bristol and Gloucestershire) runs along the southern bank of the Avon from the Bristol Channel, then follows around the southern edge of the Bristol built-up area, before continuing upstream along the Avon and then diverges from the river to include Bath and its historic hinterland to the north of the Avon, before meeting Wiltshire at the \"Three Shire Stones\" on the \"Fosse Way\" at Batheaston.\nCities and towns.\nSomerton took over from Ilchester as the county town in the late thirteenth century, but it declined in importance and the status of county town transferred to Taunton about 1366. The county has two cities, Bath and Wells, and (including the county town of Taunton, which has no town council but instead is the chief settlement of the county's only extant borough). The largest urban areas in terms of population are Bath, Weston-super-Mare, Taunton, Yeovil and Bridgwater.\nMany settlements developed because of their strategic importance in relation to geographical features, such as river crossings or valleys in ranges of hills. Examples include Axbridge on the River Axe, Castle Cary on the River Cary, North Petherton on the River Parrett, and Ilminster, where there was a crossing point on the River Isle. Midsomer Norton lies on the River Somer; while the Wellow Brook and the \"Fosse Way\" Roman road run through Radstock. Chard is the most southerly town in Somerset and one of the highest, though at an altitude of Wiveliscombe is the highest town in the county.\nGreen belt.\nThe county contains several-miles-wide sections of the Avon green belt area, which is primarily in place to prevent urban sprawl from the Bristol and Bath built up areas encroaching into the rural areas of North Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset, and Mendip districts in the county, as well as maintaining surrounding countryside. It stretches from the coastline between the towns of Portishead and Clevedon, extending eastwards past Nailsea, around the Bristol conurbation, and through to the city of Bath. The green belt border intersects with the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) along its south boundary, and meets the Cotswolds AONB by its eastern extent along the Wiltshire county border, creating an extended area protected from inappropriate development.\nGeology.\nMuch of the landscape of Somerset falls into types determined by the underlying geology. These landscapes are the limestone karst and lias of the north, the clay vales and wetlands of the centre, the oolites of the east and south, and the Devonian sandstone of the west.\nTo the north-east of the Somerset Levels, the Mendip Hills are moderately high limestone hills. The central and western Mendip Hills were designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1972 and cover . The main habitat on these hills is calcareous grassland, with some arable agriculture. To the south-west of the Somerset Levels are the Quantock Hills which was England's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty designated in 1956 which is covered in heathland, oak woodlands, ancient parklands with plantations of conifer and covers 99 square kilometres. The Somerset Coalfield is part of a larger coalfield which stretches into Gloucestershire. To the north of the Mendip hills is the Chew Valley and to the south, on the clay substrate, are broad valleys which support dairy farming and drain into the Somerset Levels.\nCaves and rivers.\nThere is an extensive network of caves, including Wookey Hole, underground rivers, and gorges, including the Cheddar Gorge and Ebbor Gorge. The county has many rivers, including the Axe, Brue, Cary, Parrett, Sheppey, Tone and Yeo. These both feed and drain the flat levels and moors of mid and west Somerset. In the north of the county the River Chew flows into the Bristol Avon. The Parrett is tidal almost to Langport, where there is evidence of two Roman wharfs. At the same site during the reign of King Charles I, river tolls were levied on boats to pay for the maintenance of the bridge.\nLevels and moors.\nThe Somerset Levels (or Somerset Levels and Moors as they are less commonly but more correctly known) are a sparsely populated wetland area of central Somerset, between the Quantock and Mendip hills. They consist of marine clay levels along the coast, and the inland (often peat based) moors. The Levels are divided into two by the Polden Hills. Land to the south is drained by the River Parrett while land to the north is drained by the River Axe and the River Brue. The total area of the Levels amounts to about \nand broadly corresponds to the administrative district of Sedgemoor but also includes the south west of Mendip district. Approximately 70% of the area is grassland and 30% is arable.\nStretching about inland, this expanse of flat land barely rises above sea level. Before it was drained, much of the land was under a shallow brackish sea in winter and was marsh land in summer. Drainage began with the Romans, and was restarted at various times: by the Anglo-Saxons; in the Middle Ages by the Glastonbury Abbey, during 1400\u20131770; and during the Second World War, with the construction of the Huntspill River. Pumping and management of water levels still continue.\nThe North Somerset Levels basin, north of the Mendips, covers a smaller geographical area than the Somerset Levels, and forms a coastal area around Avonmouth. It too was reclaimed by draining. It is mirrored, across the Severn Estuary, in Wales, by a similar low-lying area: the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels.\nIn the far west of the county, running into Devon, is Exmoor, a high Devonian sandstone moor, which was designated as a national park in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. The highest point in Somerset is Dunkery Beacon on Exmoor, with a maximum elevation of . Over 100 sites in Somerset have been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest.\nCoastline.\nThe coastline of the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary forms part of the northern border of Somerset.\nThe Bristol Channel has the second largest tidal range in the world. At Burnham-on-Sea, for example, the tidal range of a spring tide is more than .\nProposals for the construction of a Severn Barrage aim to harness this energy. The island of Steep Holm in the Bristol Channel is within the ceremonial county and is now administered by North Somerset Council.\nThe main coastal towns are, from the west to the north-east, Minehead, Watchet, Burnham-on-Sea, Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon, and Portishead. The coastal area between Minehead and the eastern extreme of the administrative county's coastline at Brean Down is known as Bridgwater Bay, and is a National Nature Reserve.\nNorth of that, the coast forms Weston Bay and Sand Bay whose northern tip, Sand Point, marks the lower limit of the Severn Estuary. In the mid and north of the county the coastline is low as the level wetlands of the levels meet the sea. In the west, the coastline is high and dramatic where the plateau of Exmoor meets the sea, with high cliffs and waterfalls.\nClimate.\nAlong with the rest of South West England, Somerset has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, but convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600\u00a0hours.\nIn December 1998, there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which are when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by the sun heating the ground, leading to convection and showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8\u201315 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.\nDemographics.\nEthnicity.\nThe population of the ceremonial county of Somerset was historically ethnically homogeneous, White British, but is now becoming less homogeneous, with the largest ethnic group, White British, constituting 90.0% of the population in the 2021 census. This proportion has consistently declined in each modern census, down from 96.4% in the 2001 census.\nIn the 2021 census, the ethnic composition of the ceremonial county of Somerset comprised: 95.4% White, 1.9% Asian, 0.6% Black, 1.6% Mixed, and 0.5% Other.\n \nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the 2021 census, the religious composition of the ceremonial county of Somerset comprised: 47.8% Christian, 43.6% No religion, 0.6% Muslim, 0.2% Hindu, 0.4% Buddhist, 0.0% Sikh, 0.1% Jewish, 0.6% Other religion, and 6.6% Not stated.\nGovernance.\nThe ceremonial county of Somerset is currently governed by three unitary authorities: Bath and North East Somerset Council (B&amp;NES), North Somerset Council, and Somerset Council. \nB&amp;NES is also part of the West of England Combined Authority.\nModern local government in Somerset began in 1889, when an administrative county was created and Somerset County Council was established; Bath was administered separately as a county borough. \nIn 1974, the county and council were abolished and replaced by two two-tier non-metropolitan counties, Somerset and Avon. Somerset was governed by a reconstituted county council and five districts: Mendip, Sedgemoor, South Somerset, Taunton Deane and West Somerset. Taunton Deane was granted borough status that same year. Avon consisted of six districts, of which three were created from areas formerly part of Somerset: Woodspring, Wansdyke, and Bath.\nIn 1996, Avon was abolished, and its districts were renamed and reorganised into unitary authorities. Woodspring was renamed 'North Somerset', and Wansdyke and Bath were abolished, and a new district covering the same area was created, named 'Bath and North East Somerset'. In 1997 the two districts and non-metropolitan county became part of the new ceremonial county of Somerset. On 1 September 2019 the non-metropolitan districts of West Somerset and Taunton Deane merged, with the new district being called Somerset West and Taunton.\nIn 2023, the non-metropolitan county was reorganised by abolishing the four districts and their councils and reconstituting Somerset County Council as a unitary authority for the non-metropolitan county, with the powers of both a district and county council, renamed Somerset Council. The two existing unitary authorities were not altered. A previous attempt to reorganise the county as a unitary authority 2007 was rejected following local opposition.\nSomerset's local government records date to 1617, longer than those of any other county; a meeting of the Quarter Sessions held at Wells in that year decided that a room should be provided \"for the safe keeping of the records of the Sessions\".\nUK Parliament.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], following the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the ceremonial county of Somerset is divided into 11 parliamentary constituencies, each returning one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Conservative\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Labour\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Liberal Democrat\nEuropean Parliament.\nFrom 1984 to 1994, Somerset was represented by Conservative Margaret Daly as part of the Somerset and Dorset West constituency for elections to the European Parliament.\nFrom 1994 to 1999, Somerset was represented by Liberal Democrat Graham Watson as part of the Somerset and North Devon constituency for elections to the European Parliament.\nFrom 1999 to 2020, Somerset was part of the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.\nCivil parishes.\nAlmost all of the county is covered by the lowest/most local form of English local government, the civil parish, with either a town or parish council (a city council in the instance of Wells) or a parish meeting; some parishes group together, with a single council or meeting for the group. The city of Bath (the area of the former county borough) and much of the town of Taunton are unparished areas.\nEconomy.\nSomerset has few industrial centres, but it does have a variety of light industry and high technology businesses, along with traditional agriculture and an increasingly important tourism sector, resulting in an unemployment rate of 2.5%. Tourism was estimated in 2013 to support around 26,000 people.\nBridgwater was developed during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further upriver to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped.\nWith its good links to the motorway system, Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. Leonardo Helicopters, formerly AgustaWestland, manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town.\nSomerset is an important supplier of defence equipment and technology. A Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Bridgwater was built at the start of the Second World War, between the villages of Puriton and Woolavington, to manufacture explosives. The site was decommissioned and closed in July 2008. Templecombe has Thales Underwater Systems, and Taunton presently has the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and Avimo, which became part of Thales Optics. It was announced twice, in 2006 and 2007, that manufacturing is to end at Thales Optics' Taunton site, but the trade unions and Taunton Deane District Council are working to reverse or mitigate these decisions. Other high-technology companies include the optics company Gooch and Housego at Ilminster. There are Ministry of Defence offices in Bath, and Norton Fitzwarren is the home of 40 Commando Royal Marines. The Royal Naval Air Station in Yeovilton, is one of Britain's two active Fleet Air Arm bases and is home to the Royal Navy's AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat helicopters and the Royal Marines Commando AgustaWestland AW101 Merlins.\nAgriculture and food and drink production continue to be major industries in the county, employing over 15,000 people. Apple orchards were once plentiful, and Somerset is still a major producer of cider. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet are involved with the production of cider, especially Blackthorn Cider, which is sold nationwide, and there are specialist producers such as Burrow Hill Cider Farm and Thatchers Cider. Gerber Products Company in Bridgwater is the largest producer of fruit juices in Europe, producing brands such as Sunny Delight and Ocean Spray. Development of the milk-based industries, such as Ilchester Cheese Company and Yeo Valley Organic, have resulted in the production of a range of desserts, yoghurts and cheeses.\nTraditional willow growing and weaving (such as basket weaving) is not as extensive as it used to be but is still carried out on the Somerset Levels and is commemorated at the Willows and Wetlands Visitor Centre. Fragments of willow basket were found near the Glastonbury Lake Village, and it was also used in the construction of several Iron Age causeways. The willow was harvested using a traditional method of pollarding, where a tree would be cut back to the main stem. During the 1930s, more than of willow were being grown commercially on the Levels. Largely due to the displacement of baskets with plastic bags and cardboard boxes, the industry has severely declined since the 1950s. By the end of the 20th century, only about were grown commercially, near the villages of Burrowbridge, Westonzoyland, and North Curry.\nTowns such as Castle Cary and Frome grew around the medieval weaving industry. Street developed as a centre for the production of woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, with C&amp;J Clark establishing its headquarters in the village. C&amp;J Clark's shoes are no longer manufactured there as the work was transferred to lower-wage areas, such as China and Asia.\nThe county has a long tradition of supplying freestone and . Quarries at Doulting supplied freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral. Bath stone is also widely used. Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century, as did Hans Price in the 19th century, but it was used long before then. It was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel, at locations in Wiltshire such as Box. Bath stone is still used on a reduced scale today, but more often as a cladding rather than a structural material. Further south, Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from Ham Hill, which is also widely used in the construction industry. Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement. Until the 1960s, Puriton had Blue Lias stone quarries, as did several other Polden villages. Its quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball, adjacent to the King's Sedgemoor Drain. Its derelict, early 20th-century remains were removed when the M5 motorway was constructed in the mid-1970s. Since the 1920s, the county has supplied aggregates. Foster Yeoman is Europe's largest supplier of limestone aggregates, with quarries at Merehead Quarry. It has a dedicated railway operation, Mendip Rail, which is used to transport aggregates by rail from a group of Mendip quarries.\nIn November 2008, a public sector inward investment organisation was launched, called Into Somerset, with the intention of growing the county's economy by promoting it to businesses that may wish to relocate from other parts of the UK (especially London) and the world. This is now part of the Heart of the South West Growth Hub.\nNuclear electricity.\nHinkley Point C nuclear power station is a project to construct a 3,200 MW two-reactor nuclear power station. On 18 October 2010, the British government announced that Hinkley Point\u00a0\u2013 already the site of the disused Hinkley Point A and (operational at the time) Hinkley Point B power stations\u00a0\u2013 was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. NNB Generation Company, a subsidiary of EDF, submitted an application for development consent to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on 31 October 2011. A protest group, Stop Hinkley, was formed to campaign for the closure of Hinkley Point B and oppose any expansion at the Hinkley Point site. In December 2013, the European Commission opened an investigation to assess whether the project breaks state-aid rules. On 8 October 2014 it was announced that the European Commission has approved the project, with an overwhelming majority and only four commissioners voting against the decision. Construction is underway and is projected to be completed in 2025.\nEmergency services.\nAll of the ceremonial county of Somerset is covered by the Avon and Somerset Police, a police force which also covers Bristol and South Gloucestershire. The police force is governed by the elected Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner. The Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service covers the area of the Somerset County Council as well as the entire ceremonial county of Devon. The unitary districts of North Somerset and Bath &amp; North East Somerset are instead covered by the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, a service which also covers Bristol and South Gloucestershire. The South Western Ambulance Service covers the entire South West of England, including all of Somerset. The Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance is a charitable organisation based in the county.\nCulture.\nIn Arthurian legend, Avalon became associated with Glastonbury Tor when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have discovered the bones of King Arthur and his queen. What is more certain is that Glastonbury was an important religious centre by 700 and claims to be \"the oldest above-ground Christian church in the World\" situated \"in the mystical land of Avalon\". The claim is based on dating the founding of the community of monks at AD\u00a063, the year of the legendary visit of Joseph of Arimathea, who was supposed to have brought the Holy Grail.\nDuring the Middle Ages there were also important religious sites at Woodspring Priory and Muchelney Abbey. The present Diocese of Bath and Wells covers Somerset\u00a0\u2013 with the exception of the Parish of Abbots Leigh with Leigh Woods in North Somerset\u00a0\u2013 and a small area of Dorset. The Episcopal seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells is now in the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew in the city of Wells, having previously been at Bath Abbey. Before the English Reformation, it was a Roman Catholic diocese; the county now falls within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton. The Benedictine monastery Saint Gregory's Abbey, commonly known as Downside Abbey, is at Stratton-on-the-Fosse, and the ruins of the former Cistercian Cleeve Abbey are near the village of Washford.\nSomerset has traditions of art, music, and literature. Wordsworth and Coleridge wrote while staying in Coleridge Cottage, Nether Stowey. The novelist John Cowper Powys (1872\u20131963) lived in the Somerset village of Montacute from 1885 until 1894 and his novels \"Wood and Stone\" (1915) and \"A Glastonbury Romance\" (1932) are set in Somerset. The writer Evelyn Waugh spent his last years in the village of Combe Florey.Traditional folk music, both song and dance, was important in the agricultural communities. Somerset songs were collected by Cecil Sharp and incorporated into works such as Holst's \"A Somerset Rhapsody\". Halsway Manor near Williton is an international centre for folk music. The tradition continues today with groups such as The Wurzels specialising in Scrumpy and Western music.\nThe Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts takes place most years in Pilton, near Shepton Mallet, attracting over 170,000 music and culture lovers from around the world to see world-famous entertainers.\nThe Big Green Gathering, which grew out of the Green fields at the Glastonbury Festival, is held in the Mendip Hills between Charterhouse and Compton Martin each summer.\nThe annual Bath Literature Festival is one of several local festivals in the county; others include the Frome Festival and the Trowbridge Village Pump Festival, which, despite its name, is held at Farleigh Hungerford in Somerset. The annual circuit of West Country Carnival is held in a variety of Somerset towns during the autumn, forming a major regional festival, and the largest Festival of Lights in Europe.\nThe county has several museums; those at Bath include the American Museum in Britain, the Museum of Bath Architecture, the Herschel Museum of Astronomy, the Jane Austen Centre, and the Roman Baths. Other visitor attractions which reflect the cultural heritage of the county include: Claverton Pumping Station, Dunster Working Watermill, the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton, Nunney Castle, The Helicopter Museum in Weston-super-Mare, King John's Hunting Lodge in Axbridge, Blake Museum Bridgwater, Radstock Museum, Museum of Somerset in Taunton, the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury, and Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum.\nSomerset has 11,500 listed buildings, 523 scheduled monuments, 192 conservation areas, 41 parks and gardens including those at Barrington Court, Holnicote Estate, Prior Park Landscape Garden and Tintinhull Garden, 36 English Heritage sites and 19 National Trust sites, including Clevedon Court, Fyne Court, Montacute House and Tyntesfield as well as Stembridge Tower Mill, the last remaining thatched windmill in England. Other historic houses in the county which have remained in private ownership or used for other purposes include Halswell House and Marston Bigot. A key contribution of Somerset architecture is its medieval church towers. Jenkins writes, \"These structures, with their buttresses, bell-opening tracery and crowns, rank with Nottinghamshire alabaster as England's finest contribution to medieval art.\"\nBath Rugby play at the Recreation Ground in Bath, and the Somerset County Cricket Club are based at the County Ground in Taunton. The county's highest-ranked football club is Yeovil Town, currently playing in the National League. Horse racing courses are at Taunton, Bath and Wincanton.\nThe county is served by the regional \"Western Daily Press\" and local newspapers including the \"Weston &amp; Somerset Mercury\", the \"Bath Chronicle\", \"Chew Valley Gazette\", \"Somerset County Gazette,\" \"Clevedon Mercury\" \"Mendip Times\", and the \"West Somerset Free Press\". Television is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country, while southwestern parts of the county can receive BBC South West. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset, BBC Radio Bristol (in northern parts of the county), Heart West, and Greatest Hits Radio South West in Yeovil.\nA flag representing the historic county of Somerset was registered with the Flag Institute following a competition in July 2013.\nTransport.\nSomerset has of roads. The main arterial routes, which include the M5 motorway, A303, A37, A38, A39, A358 and A361 give good access across the county, but many areas can only be accessed via narrow country lanes.\nRail services are provided by the West of England Main Line through Yeovil Junction, the Bristol to Exeter line, Heart of Wessex line which runs from Bristol Temple Meads to Weymouth and the Reading to Taunton line. The main train operator in Somerset is Great Western Railway, with other services operated by South Western Railway and CrossCountry.\nBristol Airport, located in North Somerset, provides national and international air services.\nThe Somerset Coal Canal was built in the early 19th century to reduce the cost of transportation of coal and other heavy produce. The first , running from a junction with the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal, along the Cam valley, to a terminal basin at Paulton, were in use by 1805, together with several tramways. A planned branch to Midford was never built, but in 1815 a tramway was laid along its towing path. In 1871 the tramway was purchased by the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway (S&amp;DJR), and operated until the 1950s.\nThe 19th century saw improvements to Somerset's roads with the introduction of turnpikes, and the building of canals and railways. Nineteenth-century canals included the Bridgwater &amp; Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset &amp; Somerset Canal was proposed, but little of it was ever constructed and it was abandoned in 1803.\nThe usefulness of the canals was short-lived, though some have now been restored for recreation. The 19th century also saw the construction of railways to and through Somerset. The county was served by five pre-1923 Grouping railway companies: the Great Western Railway (GWR); a branch of the Midland Railway (MR) to Bath Green Park (and another one to Bristol); the S&amp;DJR, and the London &amp; South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR).\nThe former main lines of the GWR are still in use today, although many of its branch lines were scrapped as part of the Beeching cuts. The former lines of the S&amp;DJR closed completely, as has the branch of the Midland Railway to Bath Green Park (and to Bristol St Philips). The L&amp;SWR survived as a part of the present West of England Main Line. None of these lines, in Somerset, is electrified. Two branch lines, the West and East Somerset Railway, were rescued and transferred back to private ownership as \"heritage\" lines. The fifth railway was a short-lived light railway, the Weston, Clevedon &amp; Portishead Light Railway. The West Somerset Mineral Railway carried the iron ore from the Brendon Hills to Watchet.\nUntil the 1960s the piers at Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon, Portishead and Minehead were served by the paddle steamers of P &amp; A Campbell who ran regular services to Barry and Cardiff as well as Ilfracombe and Lundy Island. The original stone pier at Burnham-on-Sea was used for commercial goods; one of the reasons for the S&amp;DJR was to provide a link between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. The newer concrete pier at Burnham-on-Sea is claimed to be the shortest pier in Britain. In the 1970s the Royal Portbury Dock was constructed to provide extra capacity for the Port of Bristol.\nFor long-distance holiday traffic travelling through the county to and from Devon and Cornwall, Somerset is often regarded as a marker on the journey. North\u2013south traffic moves through the county via the M5 motorway. Traffic to and from the east travels either via the A303 road, or the M4 motorway, which runs east\u2013west, crossing the M5 motorway just beyond the northern limits of the county.\nEducation.\nState schools in Somerset are provided by three local education authorities: Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset, and the larger Somerset County Council. All state schools are comprehensive. In some areas, primary, infant and junior schools cater for ages four to eleven, after which the pupils move on to secondary schools. There is a three-tier system of first, middle and upper schools in the Cheddar Valley, and in West Somerset, while most other schools in the county use the two-tier system. Somerset has 30 state and 17 independent secondary schools; Bath and North East Somerset has 13 state and 5 independent secondary schools; and North Somerset has 10 state and 2 independent secondary schools, excluding sixth form colleges.\nSome of the county's secondary schools have specialist school status. Some schools have sixth forms, and others transfer their sixth formers to colleges. Several schools can trace their origins back many years, such as The Blue School in Wells and Richard Huish College in Taunton. Others have changed their names over the years such as Beechen Cliff School which was started in 1905 as the City of Bath Boys' School and changed to its present name in 1972 when the grammar school was amalgamated with a local secondary modern school, to form a comprehensive school. Many others were established and built since the Second World War. In 2006, 5,900 pupils in Somerset sat GCSE examinations, with 44.5% achieving 5 grades A-C, including English and Maths (compared to 45.8% for England).\nSexey's School is a state boarding school in Bruton that also takes day pupils from the surrounding area. The Somerset LEA also provides special schools such as Newbury Manor School, which caters for children aged between 10 and 17 with special educational needs. Provision for pupils with special educational needs is also made by the mainstream schools.\nThere is also a range of private or public schools. Many of these are for pupils between 11 and 18 years, such as King's College, Taunton, Wellington School, Somerset, and Taunton School. King's School, Bruton was founded in 1519 and received royal foundation status around 30 years later in the reign of Edward VI. Millfield is the largest co-educational boarding school. There are also preparatory schools for younger children, such as All Hallows, and Hazlegrove Preparatory School. Chilton Cantelo School offers places both to day pupils and boarders aged 7 to 16. Other schools provide education for children from the age of 3 or 4 years through to 18, such as King Edward's School, Bath, Queen's College, Taunton, and Wells Cathedral School, which is one of the five established musical schools for school-age children in Britain.\nSome of these schools have religious affiliations, such as Monkton Combe School, Prior Park College, Sidcot School which is associated with the Religious Society of Friends, Downside School which is a Roman Catholic public school in Stratton-on-the-Fosse, situated next to the Benedictine Downside Abbey, and Kingswood School, which was founded by John Wesley in 1748 in Kingswood near Bristol, originally for the education of the sons of the itinerant ministers (clergy) of the Methodist Church.\nFurther and higher education.\nA wide range of adult education and further education courses is available in Somerset, in schools, colleges, and other community venues. The colleges include Weston College, Bridgwater and Taunton College (formed in 2016 when Bridgwater College and Somerset College of Arts and Technology merged, and includes the Taunton-based University Centre Somerset), Bath College, Frome Community College, Richard Huish College, Strode College and Yeovil College. Somerset County Council operates Dillington House, a residential adult education college located in Ilminster.\nThe University of Bath, Bath Spa University, and University Centre Weston are higher education establishments in the north of the county. The University of Bath gained its Royal Charter in 1966, although its origins go back to the Bristol Trade School (founded 1856) and Bath School of Pharmacy (founded 1907). It has a purpose-built campus at Claverton on the outskirts of Bath, and has 15,000 students. Bath Spa University, which is based at Newton St Loe, achieved university status in 2005, and has origins including the Bath Academy of Art (founded 1898), Bath Teacher Training College, and the Bath College of Higher Education. It has several campuses and 5,500 students.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "51764", "revid": "227290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51764", "title": "Rock Around the Clock", "text": "1954 rock and roll song\n\"Rock Around the Clock\" is a rock and roll song in the 12-bar blues format written by Max C. Freedman and James E. Myers (the latter being under the pseudonym \"Jimmy De Knight\") in 1952. The best-known and most successful rendition was recorded by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets in 1954 for American Decca. It was a number one single for two months and did well on the United Kingdom charts; the recording also reentered the UK Singles Chart in the 1960s and 1970s.\nIt was the first rock and roll record to top the pop charts in both the US and UK\u2014Bill Haley had American chart success with \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" in 1953, and in 1954, \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" sung by Big Joe Turner reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart. Haley's recording became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth, particularly after it was included in the 1955 film \"Blackboard Jungle\". It was number 1 on the pop charts for two months and went to number 3 on the R&amp;B chart.\nThe recording is widely considered to be the song that, more than any other, brought rock and roll into mainstream culture around the world. The song is ranked No. 159 on the \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\nAlthough it was first recorded by Italian-American band Sonny Dae and His Knights on March 20, 1954, Myers claimed the song had been written specifically for Haley but, for legal reasons, Haley was unable to record it himself until April 12, 1954.\nThe original full title of the song was \"We're Gonna Rock Around the Clock Tonight!\". This was later shortened to \"(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock\", though this form is generally used only on releases of the 1954 Bill Haley Decca Records recording; most other recordings of this song by Haley and others (including Sonny Dae) shorten this title further to its present form.\nIn 2018, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nFalse starts.\nThere are sources that indicate that \"Rock Around the Clock\" was written in 1953, but documents uncovered by historian Jim Dawson indicate it was in fact written in late 1952. The original arrangement of the song bore little resemblance to the version recorded by Haley, and was in fact closer to a popular instrumental of the day called \"The Syncopated Clock\" (written by Leroy Anderson).\nThe song was credited to Myers (as \"Jimmy DeKnight\") and Max C. Freedman when it was copyrighted on March 31, 1953. However, its exact authorship is disputed, with many speculating that Freedman wrote the song on his own. There were several earlier songs of the title \"Rock Around the Clock\" (by Hal Singer and Wally Mercer), but they are unrelated to the Freedman/Myers song. In addition, it is sometimes erroneously stated that \"Rock Around the Clock\" is copied from a late-1940s Big Joe Turner recording, \"Around the Clock Blues\". Though the titles are similar, the two songs bear little resemblance. There are many blues songs with the theme of partying or making love \"round the clock\", with various actions specified at various hours.\nHowever, the verse melody of \"Rock Around the Clock\" does bear a very close similarity to that of Hank Williams' first hit, \"Move It On Over\", from 1947. \nAccording to the Haley biographies \"Bill Haley\" by John Swenson and \"Rock Around the Clock\" by Dawson, the song was offered to Haley by Jimmy Myers in the wake of his first national success, \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" in 1953, after being copyrighted with the U.S. Library of Congress on March 31. Haley and his Comets began performing the song on stage (Comets bass player Marshall Lytle and drummer Dick Richards say the first performances were in Wildwood, New Jersey at Phil and Eddie's Surf Club), but Dave Miller, his producer, refused to allow Haley to record it for his Essex Records label (Swenson suggests a feud existed between Myers and Miller).\nHaley himself claimed to have taken the sheet music into the recording studio at least twice, with Miller ripping up the music each time. Nonetheless, rumors of a 1953 demo recording by Haley persist to this day, although surviving members of the Comets deny this, as did Haley himself (quoted in the Swenson biography); a late-1960s bootleg single of the Decca Records version of \"Rock Around the Clock\", with \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" on the B-side and carrying the Essex label, occasionally turns up for sale with the claim that it is the demo version.\nMyers next offered the song to Sonny Dae &amp; His Knights, a novelty all-white musical group led by Italian-American Paschal Vennitti, and organized the recording on March 20, 1954. The group's subsequent recording, on the Arcade Records label (owned by Haley's manager, Jack Howard), was a regional success, although it sounded very different from what Haley would later record.\nDecca recording session.\nAfter leaving Essex Records in the spring of 1954, Bill Haley signed with Decca Records, and the band's first recording session was set for April 12, 1954, at Decca's studios in the Pythian Temple in New York City. The recording session almost failed to take place because the band was traveling on a ferry that got stuck on a sandbar en route to New York from Philadelphia. Once at the studio, producer Milt Gabler (Gabler was the uncle of actor Billy Crystal and had produced Louis Jordan as well as Billie Holiday), insisted the band work on a song entitled \"Thirteen Women (and Only One Man in Town)\" (written and previously recorded by Dickie Thompson), which Gabler wanted to promote as the A-side of the group's first single for Decca.\nNear the end of the session, the band finally recorded a take of \"Rock Around the Clock\", but Haley's vocals were drowned out by the band. A second take was quickly made with minimal accompaniment while Sammy Davis Jr. waited outside the studio for his turn behind the microphone. Decca engineers later combined the two versions into one version. (Comets piano player Johnny Grande tells a slightly different version, claiming that the only reason a second take was recorded was that the drummer made an error.)\nMany musicians have claimed that they performed on the recording session for \"Rock Around the Clock\". Song co-writer Myers once claimed he had played drums on the piece, although he also claimed to have been advising the sound mixer in the recording booth. According to the official record sheet from the session, however, the musicians on the famous recording are:\nDick Richards, Haley's drummer at the time, confirmed in a 2016 interview with Dutch journalist Gerbren Deves, that it was not him, but Gussak playing drums on the recording. Despite not being members of Bill Haley and His Comets, Gussak and Cedrone were trusted session players that Haley had used before. Cedrone's guitar solo was one that he used before on Bill Haley And The Saddlemen's version of \"Rock the Joint\" in 1952, and is considered one of the classic rock and roll guitar solos of all time. (Cedrone died in a fall down a stairway on June 17, 1954, and never lived to see his contribution become famous and legendary.) The second instrumental break recreates a popular rhythm and blues \"out chorus\" with tenor sax and guitar emulating the rhythm section.\nThe version of \"Rock Around the Clock\" that was used in the movie \"Blackboard Jungle\" differs from the hit single version. The difference is in the two solo breaks. The record has the guitar solo taking the first break and the sax solo taking the second break. The movie version is just the opposite with the sax solo coming first.\nIn a 2005 retrospective on his uncle Milt Gabler's work (\"The Milt Gabler Story\"), Billy Crystal identifies Haley's 1954 recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" as the single most important song Gabler ever produced. Gabler had previously been responsible for the highly successful string of R&amp;B and jump blues recordings by Louis Jordan in the late 1940s, which were characterised by their strong beat, clearly enunciated lyrics and high production values, all features which Gabler sought to repeat in Haley's recordings. Also significantly, \"Rock Around the Clock\" was recorded in the very same month that Atlantic Records issued Big Joe Turner's \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\". In relation to \"Rock Around the Clock\", Gabler said: \"I was aware that rock was starting. I knew what was happening in the Philadelphia area, and \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" had been a hit about a year before that. It already was starting and I wanted to take it from there.\"\nAlthough the record is sometimes claimed to be the first in the rock and roll genre, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"That's All Right\" were generally not considered the first rock and roll records but rather \"the first white artists' interpretations of a sound already well-established by black musicians almost a decade before. It was a raucous, driving, unnamed variant of rhythm and blues that came complete with lyrics that talked about 'rocking'.\" Later in the same article, Petridis relates that Tony Cajiao, then the editor of Now Dig This!, offered the conclusion \"... you have to say that Rock Around the Clock was the first record that really brought everything together, that made tremors around the world.\"\nSlow road to classic hit status.\nAs Gabler intended, \"Rock Around the Clock\" was first issued in May 1954 as a B-side to \"Thirteen Women (and Only One Man in Town)\". While the song did make the American \"Cashbox\" music charts (contrary to popular opinion that it was a flop), it was considered a commercial disappointment. It was not until 1955, when \"Rock Around the Clock\" was used under the opening credits and four additional times in the film \"Blackboard Jungle\", that the song truly took off.\nMany versions of the story behind how \"Rock Around the Clock\" was chosen for \"Blackboard Jungle\" circulated over the years. Recent research, however, reveals that the song was chosen from the collection of young Peter Ford, the son of \"Blackboard Jungle\" star Glenn Ford and dancer Eleanor Powell. The producers were looking for a song to represent the type of music the youth of 1955 were listening to. The elder Ford borrowed several records from his son, one of which was Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\". In 2004, the song finished at #50 in AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.\nOn July 9, 1955 \"Rock Around the Clock\" became the first rock and roll recording to hit the top of \"Billboard\"'s Pop charts, a feat it repeated on charts around the world. The song stayed at this place for eight weeks. The record was also no.1 for seven weeks on the \"Cashbox\" pop singles chart in 1955. The Bill Haley version also hit number three on the R&amp;B charts. \"Billboard\" ranked it as the No. 2 song for 1955, behind Perez Prado's \"Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White)\".\nIn the UK, Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\" was released on Brunswick Records (and Germany as well), reaching number 17 on the UK Singles Chart in January 1955, four months before it first entered the US pop charts. The song re-entered the UK chart to reach number one in November 1955 for three weeks, and after a three-week break returned there for a further two weeks in January 1956. It re-entered the charts again in September 1956, reaching number 5. The song was re-issued in 1968, when it made number 20, and again in 1974, when it reached number 12. The song's original release saw it become the UK's first million selling single and it went on to sell over 1.4 million copies in total.\nThe band performed the song on the May 31, 1955 episode of Texaco Star Theater hosted by Milton Berle in an a cappella and lip-synched versions. On August 7, 1955, the band performed the song on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", hosted by Ed Sullivan.\nOn the heels of the song breaking into the Top 20 in the UK in 1968, Decca began plugging the single in the US, where it briefly re-entered the \"Billboard\" charts in June 1968, peaking at #118.\n\"Rock Around the Clock\" became wildly popular with teenagers around the world. The single, released by independent label Festival Records in Australia, was the biggest-selling recording in the country at the time. Columbia Pictures cashed in on the new craze by hiring Haley and his band to star in two movies, \"Rock Around the Clock\" (1956) and \"Don't Knock the Rock\" (1957). In 1957, Haley toured Europe, bringing rock 'n' roll to that continent for the first time.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;'It's very hard to tell what made me first decide to play the guitar. \"Rock Around the Clock\" by Bill Haley came out when I was ten, and that probably had something to do with it.'\u2014\u200a\nIn 1964, Bill Haley and His Comets recorded a sequel song entitled \"Dance Around the Clock\". Haley actually recorded this song on five occasions (a Spanish-language version for Orfe\u00f3n of Mexico City and an English version for the US label Newtown Records (both in 1964), two live versions for Buddah Records recorded in New York in 1969 (neither of which were released for 25 years), and once more in Nashville, Tennessee for the Swedish Sonet Records label in 1970). Despite these efforts, the song was not a commercial success.\nHaley would re-record \"Rock Around the Clock\" many times over the years (even scoring a substantial hit with a version recorded for Sonet Records in 1968), but never recaptured the magic. In 1974, the original version of the song returned to the American charts when it was used as the theme for the movie \"American Graffiti\" and a re-recorded version by Haley was used as the opening theme for the TV series \"Happy Days\" during its first two seasons. In the UK, the song again reached the top 20 and as of 2013 remains the only non-Christmas single to have done so on five separate occasions. The original version was also featured in the 1978 film \"Superman\", heard playing on a car radio just prior to Glenn Ford's final scene in the film; Ford, as noted earlier, had starred in \"Blackboard Jungle\". In 1981, about a year before Haley's death, a portion of the 1954 recording was featured in the opening credits of Season 6 of \"Austin City Limits\".\nDuring the 1970s, Haley shortened his performances of \"Rock Around the Clock\", dropping one verse and the second instrumental break from most performances. However, his last known recorded performance of the song, at a November 1979 command performance for Queen Elizabeth II, was a complete version.\nFollowing Haley's death in February 1981, a number of major tributes involving \"Rock Around the Clock\" occurred. That fall, a TV special marking the 30th anniversary of \"American Bandstand\" saw an all-star \"supergroup\" perform the song (accompanied by 1950s-era footage of Haley and the Comets). In 1982, Haley's original recording was given the Grammy Hall of Fame Award. An excerpt from the recording was included in \"Haley's Golden Medley\", a hastily compiled single in the \"Stars on 45\" mold which made the UK record charts in 1982, reaching number 50. In 1989, Haley's original Decca recording was incorporated into the \"dance mix\" single \"Swing The Mood\", credited to Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers, but legal considerations forced the album version to substitute a patchwork of re-recordings from the 1950s and 1960s (in Haley's case, a 1968 version of \"Rock Around the Clock\" recorded for Sonet Records). Since \"Swing the Mood\" was still on the sales charts going into 1990, it meant that Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\", in one way or another, appeared on UK or US sales charts in five consecutive decades.\n\"Rock Around the Clock\" is often cited as the biggest-selling vinyl rock and roll single of all time. The exact number of copies sold has never been audited; however, a figure of at least 25 million was cited by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" in its category \"Phonograph records: Biggest Sellers\" from the early 1970s until the 1990s, when the advent of compact discs led to Guinness discontinuing the category. Guinness consistently listed \"Rock Around the Clock\" as having the highest claim of any pop music recording, coming second in sales only to Bing Crosby's 1942 recording of \"White Christmas\", which was also listed as having sold 25 million copies. Haley's version alone is estimated to have sold 15 million copies, with a total of 25 million copies counting all versions. A frequently used piece of promotion regarding the song is that it is said to be playing somewhere in the world every minute of the day.\nLength variation.\nAlthough originally released on vinyl 45 and shellac 78 at a running time of 2 minutes and 8 seconds, most digital/CD releases of the original 1954 recording, starting with the \"From The Original Master Tapes\" compilation of Haley's work with Decca Records, mastered by Steve Hoffman and released in 1985, clock in at 2:10. This is due to the inclusion of a \"count-in\" by one of the Comets (saying, \"One ... two\") at the very start of the song. This was never included in the original single or album releases of the song. (All of Haley's subsequent studio rerecordings of the song run longer than 2:10 with the exception of the abbreviated version recorded for \"Happy Days\".) There are no other studio-recorded versions after the 1950s and \"Happy Days\" versions.\nTributes.\nIn tribute to the influence of the song and the movie that launched its popularity, the March 29, 2005 50th anniversary of the opening of \"Blackboard Jungle\" was marked by several large celebrations in the United States organized by promoter Martin Lewis under the blanket title \"Rock Is Fifty\". Rock Is Fifty also hosted additional celebrations in Los Angeles in July, 2005, as part of a \"Rock Around the Clock-a-Thon\" to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the date the song reached the No. 1 spot on the American charts, as well as to observe what would have been Haley's 80th birthday. These events included numerous appearances and performances by surviving members of the original Comets, including the band's induction into the Rock Walk hall of fame, a performance at the Viper Room club on the Sunset Strip, and a special performance for employees of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena to celebrate the success of the Deep Impact space probe. A special video of \"Rock Around the Clock\" was created to mark the occasion and was featured on NASA's website during July and August 2005.

The Duomo of Monza, for example, has never been a diocesan seat and is by definition not a cathedral. In a similar way, the town of Asolo has not had its own bishop since the 10th century, but the main church (rebuilt since then) is still called the Asolo Duomo. By contradistinction, the Italian word for a cathedral \"sensu stricto\" is \"cattedrale\". There is no direct translation of \"duomo\" into English, leading to many such churches being erroneously called \"cathedral\" in English, regardless of whether the church in question hosts a bishop. Each city or town will have only one \"duomo\", unless there are different denominations involved.\nLocally, people usually use \"il Duomo\", the \"Duomo\", without regard to the full proper name of the church.\nSimilar words exist in other European languages: \"Dom\" (German and Dutch), \"dom\" (Romanian), \"d\u00f3m\" (Hungarian and Slovak), \"d\u00f4me\" (French - usually less common), \"domo\" (Portuguese), \"doms\" (Latvian), \"tum\" (Polish), \"domkirke\" (Danish and Norwegian), \"d\u00f3mkirkja\" (Icelandic), \"domkyrka\" (Swedish), \"toomkirik\" (Estonian), \"tuomiokirkko\" (Finnish) and so on. Also in these languages the respective terms do not necessarily refer to a church functioning as a cathedral, but also to proto-cathedrals or simply prominent church buildings, which have never been a cathedral in the exact sense of that word. German \"Dom\" and Polish \"tum\" became the synecdoche used \u2013 \"pars pro toto\" \u2013 for most existing or former collegiate churches. Therefore, translation of these terms into English as \"cathedrals\" may not always be appropriate and should be used on a contextual basis. Generally, only the Italian \"duomo\" and the German \"Dom\" are likely to be encountered in English. \nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" and the \"Zingarelli\", the word \"duomo\" derives from the Latin word \"domus\", meaning \"house\", as a cathedral is the \"house of God\", or \"domus Dei\". The \"Garzanti online dictionary\" also gives the etymology as deriving from \"house\", but \"house of the bishop\" instead.\nItalian cathedrals are often highly decorated and contain notable artworks; in many cases the buildings themselves are true artworks. Perhaps the best known \"duomo\" is the one in Florence, but other well-known cathedrals include the Milan Cathedral and those of Siena, Alba, Ancona, Mantua and Parma.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1989, he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Thomas R. Cech for their work on the catalytic properties of RNA.\nFamily and education.\nAltman was born on May 7, 1939, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His parents, Ray (Arlin), a textile worker, and Victor Altman, a grocer, were Jewish immigrants to Canada, each coming from Eastern Europe as a young adult, in the 1920s. Altman's mother was from Bia\u0142ystok in Poland, and had come to Canada with her sister at the age of eighteen, learning English and working in a textile factory to earn money to bring the rest of their family to Quebec. Altman's father, born in Ukraine, had been a worker on a collective farm in the Soviet Union. He was sponsored to come to Canada as a farm worker, but later, as a husband and a father of two sons, he supported the family by running a small grocery store in Montreal. Sidney Altman was later to look back on his parents' lives as an illustration of the value of the work ethic: \"It was from them I learned that hard work in stable surroundings could yield rewards, even if only in infinitesimally small increments.\"\nAs Altman reached adulthood, the family's financial situation had become secure enough that he was able to pursue a college education. He went to the United States to study physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While at MIT, he was a member of the ice hockey team. After achieving his bachelor's degree from MIT in 1960, Altman spent 18 months as a graduate student in physics at Columbia University. Due to personal concerns and the lack of opportunity for beginning graduate students to participate in laboratory work, he left the program without completing the degree. Some months later, he enrolled as a graduate student in biophysics at the University of Colorado Medical Center. His project was a study of the effects of acridines on the replication of bacteriophage T4 DNA. He received his Ph.D. in biophysics from the University of Colorado in 1967 with thesis advisor Leonard Lerman; Lerman went in 1967 to Vanderbilt University, where Altman worked briefly as a researcher in molecular biology before leaving for Harvard.\nAltman was married to Ann M. K\u00f6rner (daughter of Stephan K\u00f6rner) in 1972. They are the parents of two children, Daniel and Leah. Having lived primarily in the United States since departing Montreal to attend MIT in 1958, Altman became a U.S. citizen in 1984, maintaining dual citizenship as a Canadian citizen as well.\nCareer.\nAfter receiving his Ph.D., Altman embarked upon the first of two research fellowships. He joined Matthew Meselson's laboratory at Harvard University to study a DNA endonuclease involved in the replication and recombination of T4 DNA. Later, at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, Altman started the work that led to the discovery of RNase P and the enzymatic properties of the RNA subunit of that ribozyme. John D. Smith, as well as several postdoctoral colleagues, provided Altman with very good advice that enabled him to test his ideas. \"The discovery of the first radiochemically pure precursor to a tRNA molecule enabled me to get a job as an assistant professor at Yale University in 1971, a difficult time to get any job at all\".\nAltman's career at Yale followed a standard academic pattern with promotion through the ranks until he became Professor in 1980. He was Chairman of his department from 1983 to 1985 and in 1985 became the Dean of Yale College for four years. On July 1, 1989, he returned to the post of Professor on a full-time basis. His doctoral students include Ben Stark.\nWhile at Yale, Altman's Nobel Prize work came with the analysis of the catalytic properties of the ribozyme RNase P, a ribonucleoprotein particle consisting of both a structural RNA molecule and one (in prokaryotes) or more (in eukaryotes) proteins. Originally, it was believed that, in the bacterial RNase P complex, the protein subunit was responsible for the catalytic activity of the complex, which is involved in the maturation of tRNAs. During experiments in which the complex was reconstituted in test tubes, Altman and his group discovered that the RNA component, in isolation, was sufficient for the observed catalytic activity of the enzyme, indicating that the RNA itself had catalytic properties, which was the discovery that earned him the Nobel Prize. Although the RNase P complex also exists in eukaryotic organisms, his later work revealed that in those organisms, the protein subunits of the complex are essential to the catalytic activity, in contrast to the bacterial RNase P.\nRecognition.\nAltman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1988 and a member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1990.\nDeath.\nAltman died on April 5, 2022, in Rockleigh, New Jersey, after a long illness.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the planetary physics of Earth, the pressure-gradient force prevents gravity from collapsing the atmosphere of Earth into a thin, dense shell, whereas gravity prevents the pressure-gradient force from diffusing the atmosphere into outer space. In general, it is what causes objects in space to be spherical.\nHydrostatic equilibrium is the distinguishing criterion between dwarf planets and small solar system bodies, and features in astrophysics and planetary geology. Said qualification of equilibrium indicates that the shape of the object is symmetrically rounded, mostly due to rotation, into an ellipsoid, where any irregular surface features are consequent to a relatively thin solid crust. In addition to the Sun, there are a dozen or so equilibrium objects confirmed to exist in the Solar System.\nMathematical consideration.\nFor a hydrostatic fluid on Earth:\nformula_1\nDerivation from force summation.\nNewton's laws of motion state that a volume of a fluid that is not in motion or that is in a state of constant velocity must have zero net force on it. This means the sum of the forces in a given direction must be opposed by an equal sum of forces in the opposite direction. This force balance is called a hydrostatic equilibrium.\nThe fluid can be split into a large number of cuboid volume elements; by considering a single element, the action of the fluid can be derived.\nThere are three forces: the force downwards onto the top of the cuboid from the pressure, \"P\", of the fluid above it is, from the definition of pressure,\nformula_2\nSimilarly, the force on the volume element from the pressure of the fluid below pushing upwards is\nformula_3\nFinally, the weight of the volume element causes a force downwards. If the density is \"\u03c1\", the volume is \"V\" and \"g\" the standard gravity, then:\nformula_4\nThe volume of this cuboid is equal to the area of the top or bottom, times the height\u00a0\u2013 the formula for finding the volume of a cube.\nformula_5\nBy balancing these forces, the total force on the fluid is\nformula_6\nThis sum equals zero if the fluid's velocity is constant.

By saying these changes are infinitesimally small, the equation can be written in differential form.\nformula_9\nDensity changes with pressure, and gravity changes with height, so the equation would be:\nformula_1\nDerivation from Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\nNote finally that this last equation can be derived by solving the three-dimensional Navier\u2013Stokes equations for the equilibrium situation where\nformula_11\nThen the only non-trivial equation is the formula_12-equation, which now reads\nformula_13\nThus, hydrostatic balance can be regarded as a particularly simple equilibrium solution of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\nDerivation from general relativity.\nBy plugging the energy\u2013momentum tensor for a perfect fluid\nformula_14\ninto the Einstein field equations\nformula_15\nand using the conservation condition\nformula_16\none can derive the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff equation for the structure of a static, spherically symmetric relativistic star in isotropic coordinates:\nformula_17\nIn practice, \"\u03a1\" and \"\u03c1\" are related by an equation of state of the form \"f\"(\"\u03a1\",\"\u03c1\")\u00a0=\u00a00, with \"f\" specific to makeup of the star. \"M\"(\"r\") is a foliation of spheres weighted by the mass density \"\u03c1\"(\"r\"), with the largest sphere having radius \"r\":\nformula_18\nPer standard procedure in taking the nonrelativistic limit, we let \"c\" \u2192 \u221e, so that the factor\nformula_19\nTherefore, in the nonrelativistic limit the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff equation reduces to Newton's hydrostatic equilibrium:\nformula_20\n(we have made the trivial notation change \"h\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"r\" and have used \"f\"(\"\u03a1\",\"\u03c1\")\u00a0=\u00a00 to express \"\u03c1\" in terms of \"P\"). A similar equation can be computed for rotating, axially symmetric stars, which in its gauge independent form reads:\nformula_21 \nUnlike the TOV equilibrium equation, these are two equations (for instance, if as usual when treating stars, one chooses spherical coordinates as basis coordinates formula_22, the index \"i\" runs for the coordinates \"r\" and formula_23).\nApplications.\nFluids.\nThe hydrostatic equilibrium pertains to hydrostatics and the principles of equilibrium of fluids. A hydrostatic balance is a particular balance for weighing substances in water. Hydrostatic balance allows the discovery of their specific gravities. This equilibrium is strictly applicable when an ideal fluid is in steady horizontal laminar flow, and when any fluid is at rest or in vertical motion at constant speed. It can also be a satisfactory approximation when flow speeds are low enough that acceleration is negligible.\nAstrophysics and planetary science.\nFrom the time of Isaac Newton much work has been done on the subject of the equilibrium attained when a fluid rotates in space. This has application to both stars and objects like planets, which may have been fluid in the past or in which the solid material deforms like a fluid when subjected to very high stresses.\nIn any given layer of a star, there is a hydrostatic equilibrium between the outward-pushing pressure gradient and the weight of the material above pressing inward. One can also study planets under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. A rotating star or planet in hydrostatic equilibrium is usually an oblate spheroid, an ellipsoid in which two of the principal axes are equal and longer than the third.\nAn example of this phenomenon is the star Vega, which has a rotation period of 12.5 hours. Consequently, Vega is about 20% larger at the equator than from pole to pole.\nIn his 1687 \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" Newton correctly stated that a rotating fluid of uniform density under the influence of gravity would take the form of a spheroid and that the gravity (including the effect of centrifugal force) would be weaker at the equator than at the poles by an amount equal (at least asymptotically) to five fourths the centrifugal force at the equator. In 1742, Colin Maclaurin published his treatise on fluxions in which he showed that the spheroid was an exact solution. If we designate the equatorial radius by formula_24 the polar radius by formula_25 and the eccentricity by formula_26 with\n formula_27\nhe found that the gravity at the poles is\n formula_28\nwhere formula_29 is the gravitational constant, formula_30 is the (uniform) density, and formula_31 is the total mass. The ratio of this to formula_32 the gravity if the fluid is not rotating, is asymptotic to\n formula_33\nas formula_34 goes to zero, where formula_35 is the flattening:\n formula_36\nThe gravitational attraction on the equator (not including centrifugal force) is\n formula_37\nAsymptotically, we have:\n formula_38\nMaclaurin showed (still in the case of uniform density) that the component of gravity toward the axis of rotation depended only on the distance from the axis and was proportional to that distance, and the component in the direction toward the plane of the equator depended only on the distance from that plane and was proportional to that distance. Newton had already pointed out that the gravity felt on the equator (including the lightening due to centrifugal force) has to be formula_39 in order to have the same pressure at the bottom of channels from the pole or from the equator to the centre, so the centrifugal force at the equator must be\n formula_40\nDefining the latitude to be the angle between a tangent to the meridian and axis of rotation, the total gravity felt at latitude formula_41 (including the effect of centrifugal force) is\n formula_42\nThis spheroid solution is stable up to a certain (critical) angular momentum (normalized by formula_43), but in 1834, Carl Jacobi showed that it becomes unstable once the eccentricity reaches 0.81267 (or formula_35 reaches 0.3302).\nAbove the critical value, the solution becomes a Jacobi, or scalene, ellipsoid (one with all three axes different). Henri Poincar\u00e9 in 1885 found that at still higher angular momentum it will no longer be ellipsoidal but piriform or oviform. The symmetry drops from the 8-fold D2h point group to the 4-fold C2v, with its axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Other shapes satisfy the equations beyond that, but are not stable, at least not near the point of bifurcation. Poincar\u00e9 was unsure what would happen at higher angular momentum but concluded that eventually the blob would split into two.\nThe assumption of uniform density may apply more or less to a molten planet or a rocky planet but does not apply to a star or to a planet like the earth which has a dense metallic core. In 1737, Alexis Clairaut studied the case of density varying with depth. Clairaut's theorem states that the variation of the gravity (including centrifugal force) is proportional to the square of the sine of the latitude, with the proportionality depending linearly on the flattening (formula_35) and the ratio at the equator of centrifugal force to gravitational attraction. (Compare with the exact relation above for the case of uniform density.) Clairaut's theorem is a special case for an oblate spheroid of a connexion found later by Pierre-Simon Laplace between the shape and the variation of gravity.\nIf the star has a massive nearby companion object, tidal forces come into play as well, which distort the star into a scalene shape if rotation alone would make it a spheroid. An example of this is Beta Lyrae.\nHydrostatic equilibrium is also important for the intracluster medium, where it restricts the amount of fluid that can be present in the core of a cluster of galaxies.\nWe can also use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium to estimate the velocity dispersion of dark matter in clusters of galaxies. Only baryonic matter (or, rather, the collisions thereof) emits X-ray radiation. The absolute X-ray luminosity per unit volume takes the form formula_46 where formula_47 and formula_48 are the temperature and density of the baryonic matter, and formula_49 is some function of temperature and fundamental constants. The baryonic density satisfies the above equation \nformula_50\nThe integral is a measure of the total mass of the cluster, with formula_51 being the proper distance to the center of the cluster. Using the ideal gas law formula_52 (formula_53 is the Boltzmann constant and formula_54 is a characteristic mass of the baryonic gas particles) and rearranging, we arrive at\nformula_55\nMultiplying by formula_56 and differentiating with respect to formula_51 yields\nformula_58\nIf we make the assumption that cold dark matter particles have an isotropic velocity distribution, the same derivation applies to these particles, and their density formula_59 satisfies the non-linear differential equation\nformula_60\nWith perfect X-ray and distance data, we could calculate the baryon density at each point in the cluster and thus the dark matter density. We could then calculate the velocity dispersion formula_61 of the dark matter, which is given by \nformula_62 \nThe central density ratio formula_63 is dependent on the redshift formula_12 of the cluster and is given by\nformula_65 \nwhere formula_23 is the angular width of the cluster and formula_67 the proper distance to the cluster. Values for the ratio range from 0.11 to 0.14 for various surveys.\nPlanetary geology.\nThe concept of hydrostatic equilibrium has also become important in determining whether an astronomical object is a planet, dwarf planet, or small Solar System body. According to the definition of planet that was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, one defining characteristic of planets and dwarf planets is that they are objects that have sufficient gravity to overcome their own rigidity and assume hydrostatic equilibrium. Such a body often has the differentiated interior and geology of a world (a planemo), but near-hydrostatic or formerly hydrostatic bodies such as the proto-planet 4 Vesta may also be differentiated and some hydrostatic bodies (notably Callisto) have not thoroughly differentiated since their formation. Often, the equilibrium shape is an oblate spheroid, as is the case with Earth. However, in the cases of moons in synchronous orbit, nearly unidirectional tidal forces create a scalene ellipsoid. Also, the purported dwarf planet Haumea is scalene because of its rapid rotation though it may not currently be in equilibrium.\nIcy objects were previously believed to need less mass to attain hydrostatic equilibrium than rocky objects. The smallest object that appears to have an equilibrium shape is the icy moon Mimas at 396\u00a0km, but the largest icy object known to have an obviously non-equilibrium shape is the icy moon Proteus at 420\u00a0km, and the largest rocky bodies in an obviously non-equilibrium shape are the asteroids Pallas and Vesta at about 520\u00a0km. However, Mimas is not actually in hydrostatic equilibrium for its current rotation. The smallest body confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the dwarf planet Ceres, which is icy, at 945\u00a0km, and the largest known body to have a noticeable deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium is Iapetus being made of mostly permeable ice and almost no rock. At 1,469\u00a0km Iapetus is neither spherical nor ellipsoid. Instead, it is rather in a strange walnut-like shape due to its unique equatorial ridge. Some icy bodies may be in equilibrium at least partly due to a subsurface ocean, which is not the definition of equilibrium used by the IAU (gravity overcoming internal rigid-body forces). Even larger bodies deviate from hydrostatic equilibrium, although they are ellipsoidal: examples are Earth's Moon at 3,474\u00a0km (mostly rock), and the planet Mercury at 4,880\u00a0km (mostly metal).\nIn 2024, Kiss et al. found that Quaoar has an ellipsoidal shape incompatible with hydrostatic equilibrium for its current spin. They hypothesised that Quaoar originally had a rapid rotation and was in hydrostatic equilibrium but that its shape became \"frozen in\" and did not change as it spun down because of tidal forces from its moon Weywot. If so, this would resemble the situation of Iapetus, which is too oblate for its current spin. Iapetus is generally still considered a planetary-mass moon nonetheless though not always.\nSolid bodies have irregular surfaces, but local irregularities may be consistent with global equilibrium. For example, the massive base of the tallest mountain on Earth, Mauna Kea, has deformed and depressed the level of the surrounding crust and so the overall distribution of mass approaches equilibrium.\nAtmospheric modeling.\nIn the atmosphere, the pressure of the air decreases with increasing altitude. This pressure difference causes an upward force called the pressure-gradient force. The force of gravity balances this out, keeps the atmosphere bound to Earth and maintains pressure differences with altitude.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The FAA is one of five . As of 2023[ [update]] it is a primarily helicopter force, though also operating the F-35B Lightning II carrier-based stealth fighter jointly with the Royal Air Force. \nThe RAF was formed by the 1918 merger of the RN's Royal Naval Air Service with the British Army's Royal Flying Corps. The FAA did not come under the direct control of the Admiralty until mid-1939. During the Second World War, the FAA operated aircraft on ships as well as land-based aircraft that defended the Royal Navy's shore establishments and facilities.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nBritish naval flying started in 1909, with the construction of an airship for naval duties. In 1911 the Royal Navy graduated its first aeroplane pilots at the Royal Aero Club flying ground near Eastchurch, Isle of Sheppey under the tutelage of pioneer aviator George Bertram Cockburn. In May 1912, naval and army aviation were combined to become the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The Naval Wing of the RFC lasted until July 1914 when the Royal Navy reformed its air branch, under the Air Department of the Admiralty, naming it the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). By the outbreak of the First World War, in August 1914, the RNAS had more aircraft under its control than the remaining RFC. The roles of the RNAS were fleet reconnaissance, patrolling coasts for enemy ships and submarines, attacking enemy coastal territory and defending Britain from enemy air raids, along with deployment along the Western Front. In April 1918 the RNAS, which at this time had 67,000 officers and men, 2,949 aircraft, 103 airships and 126 coastal stations, merged with the RFC to form the Royal Air Force.\nFleet Air Arm.\nOn 1 April 1924, the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force was formed, encompassing those RAF units that normally embarked on aircraft carriers and fighting ships. The year was significant for British naval aviation as only weeks before the founding of the Fleet Air Arm, the Royal Navy had commissioned , the world's first ship to be designed and built as an aircraft carrier. Over the following months RAF Fleet Air Arm Fairey IIID reconnaissance biplanes operated off Hermes, conducting flying trials.\nOn 24 May 1939 the Fleet Air Arm was returned to Admiralty control under the \"Inskip Award\" (named after the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence overseeing the British re-armament programme) and renamed the Air Branch of the Royal Navy. At the onset of the Second World War, the Fleet Air Arm consisted of 20 squadrons with only 232 frontline aircraft, and 191 additional trainers. By the end of the war the strength of the Fleet Air Arm was 59 aircraft carriers, 3,700 aircraft, 72,000 officers and men and 56 Naval air stations.\nDuring the war, the FAA operated fighters, torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. Following the Dunkirk evacuation and the commencement of the Battle of Britain, the Royal Air Force soon found itself critically short of fighter pilots. In the summer of 1940, the RAF had just over 800 fighter pilots and as personnel shortages worsened; the RAF turned to the Admiralty to ask for help from the Fleet Air Arm. Fleet Air Arm crews under RAF Fighter Command were either seconded individually to RAF fighter squadrons or entire as with 804 and 808 Naval Air Squadrons. The former provided dockyard defence during the Battle of Britain with Sea Gladiators.\nIn British home waters and out into the Atlantic Ocean, operations against Axis shipping and submarines in support of the RN were mounted by RAF Coastal Command with large patrol bombers, flying boats and land-based fighter-bombers. The aircraft carrier had replaced the battleship as the capital ship of the RN and its aircraft were now its principal offensive weapons. The top scoring fighter ace with 17 victories was Commander Stanley Orr, the Royal Marine ace was Ronald Cuthbert Hay with 13 victories. A number of Royal Marines were FAA pilots during the war.\nNotable Fleet Air Arm operations during the war included the Battle of Taranto, the sinking of the \"Bismarck\", the attempt to prevent the Channel Dash, Operation Tungsten against the \"Tirpitz\" and Operation Meridian against oil plants in Sumatra.\nPost-war history.\nAfter the war the FAA needed to fly jet aircraft from their carriers. The jet aircraft of the era were considerably less effective at low speeds than propeller aircraft, but propeller aircraft could not effectively fight jets at the high speeds flown by jet aircraft. The FAA took on its first jet, the Sea Vampire, in the late 1940s. The Sea Vampire was the first jet credited with taking off and landing on a carrier. The Air Arm continued with high-powered prop aircraft alongside the new jets resulting in the FAA being woefully outpowered during the Korean War. Nevertheless, jets were not yet wholly superior to propeller aircraft and a flight of ground attack Hawker Sea Furies downed a MiG-15 and damaged others in an engagement.\nAs jets became larger, more powerful and faster they required more space to take off and land. The US Navy simply built much larger carriers. The Royal Navy had a few large carriers built and completed after the end of the war but another solution was sought. This was partly overcome by the introduction of a Royal Navy idea to angle the flight deck away from the centre line so that the aircraft landing had a clear run away from the usual forward deck park. An associated British invention, intended to provide more precise optical guidance to aircraft on final approaching the deck, was the Fresnel lens optical landing aid. Another Royal Navy invention was the use of a steam-powered catapult to cater for the larger and heavier aircraft (both systems were adopted by the US Navy).\nDefence cuts across the British armed forces during the 1960s and 1970s led to the withdrawal of existing Royal Navy aircraft carriers, transfer of Fleet Air Arm fixed-wing jet strike aircraft such as the F-4K (FG.1) Phantom II and Buccaneer S.2 to the Royal Air Force, and cancellation of large replacement aircraft carriers, including the CVA-01 design. The last conventional carrier to be retired was in 1978. When HMS \"Hermes\" was converted in 1980/81 to a STOVL carrier to operate Sea Harriers, a 'Ski-jump ramp' was fitted to aid take-off. A new series of small carriers, the anti-submarine warfare ships (known as \"through deck cruisers\") were built and equipped with the Sea Harrier a derivative of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier VTOL aircraft. These carriers incorporated an upswept forward section of the flight deck that deflected the aircraft upward on launch and permitted heavier loads to be carried by the Harrier, for example in weaponry, and the system was used extensively in the Falklands War, with both \"Hermes\" and \"Invincible\" part of the Task Force.\nAt the end of the Cold War in 1989 the Fleet Air Arm was under the command of the Flag Officer Naval Air Command, a rear admiral based at RNAS Yeovilton.\nFleet Air Arm inventory 1989.\nThe inventory of the Fleet Air Arm in 1989 consisted of the following aircraft:\nPost Cold War.\nIn 2000 the Sea Harrier force was merged with the RAF's Harrier GR7 fleet to form Joint Force Harrier. The Fleet Air Arm began withdrawing the Sea Harrier from service in 2004 with the disbandment of 800 NAS. 801 NAS disbanded on 28 March 2006 at RNAS Yeovilton (HMS \"Heron\"). 800 and 801 NAS were then combined to form the Naval Strike Wing, flying ex-RAF Harrier GR7 and GR9s. On 1 April 2010, NSW reverted to the identity of 800 Naval Air Squadron. The Harrier GR7 and GR9 retired from service in December 2010 following the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010.\nTwo new carriers able to operate the F-35B short take-off and landing variant of the US Lockheed Martin Lightning II aircraft were constructed. In the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015, it was announced that the carriers would enter service \"from 2018\". The procurement plan is for a force of 138 F-35 aircraft, which are intended to be operated by both the RAF and FAA from a common pool, in the same manner as the Joint Force Harrier. With the introduction of the F-35, the Fleet Air Arm will return to the operation of fixed-wing strike aircraft at sea. In 2013, an initial cadre of Royal Air Force and Royal Navy pilots and aircraft maintenance personnel were assigned to the U.S. Marine Corps' Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501 (VMFAT-501), part of the U.S. Air Force's 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, for training on the F-35B. 809 Naval Air Squadron will be the first FAA unit to operate the F-35B and will be based at RAF Marham.\nHelicopters.\nHelicopters also became important combat platforms since the Second World War. Initially used in the search and rescue role, they were later developed for anti-submarine warfare and troop transport; during the 1956 Suez Crisis they were used to land Royal Marine Commando forces, the first time this had ever been done in combat. Originally operated only from carriers, the development of the Westland Wasp in the 1960s allowed helicopters to operate on all ships of frigate size or larger. Wasps, Sea Kings and Wessex helicopters all played an active part in the 1982 Falklands War, while Lynx helicopters played an attack role against Iraqi patrol boats in the 1991 Gulf War and Commando Sea King HC4s as well as the Lynx HMA Mk 8 from HMS \"Argyll\", assisted in suppressing rebel forces in the British intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War in 2000.\nMuseums.\nThe Fleet Air Arm has a museum near RNAS Yeovilton (HMS \"Heron\") in Somerset, England, at which many of the great historical aircraft flown by the Service are on display, along with aircraft from other sources. There is also a Fleet Air Arm museum inside the Museum of Transport &amp; Technology in Auckland, New Zealand. On display there is a full-size replica Fairey Swordfish, along with historic items and memorabilia.\nThe FAA today.\nPersonnel.\nIn 1938, Admiralty Fleet Orders 2885 announced the formation of an Air Branch of the Royal Naval Reserve. Thirty three unmarried men signed up for eighteen months full-time flying training; however, before these first volunteers were able to gain their wings Britain was at war. At the end of hostilities in 1945 the RNVR(A) was 46,000 strong, with over 8,000 aircrew. Post war the RNVR(A) comprised 12 dedicated reserve squadrons, grouped regionally into Air Divisions. However, defence cuts in 1957 disbanded the five Air Divisions, and the following year the RNVR was merged with the RNR.\nToday.\nAs of 1 December 2013, the Regular Fleet Air Arm has a reported strength of 5,000 personnel, which represents approximately 20% of the Royal Navy's total strength (excluding Royal Marines).\nThe Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Aviation &amp; Carriers), the professional head (and also Rear Admiral Fleet Air Arm), is Rear Admiral Martin Connell as of February 2019. Under First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin\u2019s plans, the professional head of the Fleet Air Arm is set to shortly change to a one-star role, headed by a Commodore.\nMembers of the Fleet Air Arm continue to be known as WAFUs. WAFU (\"wet and f**king useless\") is said to actually derive from \"Weapon and Fuel Users\", a stores category for clothing.\nReserve Air Branch.\nThe RNR Air Branch was commissioned at RNAS Yeovilton on 16 July 1980, and shortly afterwards 38 ex-regular aircrew began refresher training. Today the RNR Air Branch comprises approximately 250 ex-regular service Officers and Ratings, covering all aviation trades, tasked to support the Fleet Air Arm.\nThe Air Branch has its roots in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Air Branch, whose members served with distinction between 1937 through the Second World War until 1950 when it was disbanded. Formed on 3 April 1980, the Air Branch was initially established to provide additional Pilots and Observers to the Royal Navy, but later expanded to include all trades and specialisations of the Fleet Air Arm. Currently comprising some 320 personnel, HMS Pegasus is one of the biggest Units in the Royal Naval Reserve.\nThe name HMS Pegasus has a long and interesting history in the Royal Navy, dating back to 1585. The second HMS Pegasus was commanded by Prince William Henry, who later became King William IV, known as the Sailor King. In late 1786, the third HMS Pegasus was stationed in the West Indies under then Captain Horatio Nelson, earning three of her four Battle Honours. The fourth and last HMS Pegasus served as a prototype fighter catapult ship, originally commissioned as HMS Ark Royal, serving primarily on convoy duty in the Second World War. \nThe name Pegasus has associations outside of the Royal Navy, including the Bristol Aeroplane Company engine that powered the Fairey Swordfish and the Rolls Royce engine that powered the BAE Sea Harrier. And, of course, the Parachute Regiment use Pegasus as their emblem.\nInsignia.\nThe FAA is known for its use of the 'Fleet Air Arm Zig Zag': a light blue zig zag on a dark blue background.\nThe pattern is thought to have belonged to the \"Perch Club\", membership of which was restricted to those who had completed 100 deck landings without an accident. The zig zag was thought to have been taken from a Creeping Line Ahead, a parallel search pattern performed by FAA aircraft in a carrier task group.\nToday, the dark blue background represents the Royal Navy; the colour of the zigzag represents the Royal Flying Corps, from which the Royal Naval Air Service was born; and the zigzag shape represents a nod to the Royal Artillery (red zigzag on blue background), given that the first people sent aloft in tethered balloons to spot the fall of shot were Royal Artillery observers. It was these observers who became early members of the Royal Flying Corps.\nAircrew wear flying badges, such as pilots wearing a pair of gold albatross wings. The wings badges also feature a crown and fouled anchor in the centre, to reflect the maritime element of the flying undertaken. Wings are worn on the left sleeve of naval aviators, unlike their other service counterparts.\nAircraft.\nThe FAA operates fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. It uses the same aircraft designation system as the RAF.\nFixed wing.\nF-35B Lightning II.\nThe introduction of the F-35B Lightning II saw a restoration of fixed wing, front-line operations to the FAA after the retirement of Joint Force Harrier in 2010. The Lightning Force is a joint RAF-Fleet Air Arm formation with all F-35Bs capable of operating from the Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. The first Fleet Air Arm squadron to operate the F-35B is 809 Naval Air Squadron which formally stood-up in December 2023, joining other F-35B squadrons within the RAF that are formally part of No. 1 Group RAF.\nAn initial order of 48 airframes was made in 2012 to equip the air wings of the two \"Queen Elizabeth\"-class aircraft carriers, with the operation split between the FAA and the Royal Air Force, as was the case with Joint Force Harrier. 809 Naval Air Squadron was announced as the second UK unit to fly the F-35B (the first being 617 Squadron RAF) and is the first FAA unit to operate the aircraft. It is understood that at least two further frontline squadrons will stand up in the future alongside 809, 617, 17(R) Test and Evaluation Squadron and an RAF-numbered Operational Conversion Unit, creating a total of six squadrons including the OCU and OEU. Under the Strategic Defence and Security Review of November 2015, the UK Government made a commitment to buying 138 F-35B, with at least 24 available for carrier use by 2023. Subsequently, following on the 2021 defence review, the First Sea Lord indicated that the new envisaged number was to be 60 aircraft initially and \"then maybe more\", up to a maximum of around 80 to hopefully equip four \"deployable squadrons\". In April 2022, the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Richard Knighton, told the House of Commons Defence Select Committee that the MoD was in discussions to purchase a second tranche of 26 F-35B fighters. Plans for frontline F-35B squadrons had been modified and now envisaged a total of three squadrons (rather than four) each deploying 12-16 aircraft. In surge conditions 24 F-35s might be deployed on the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers but a routine deployment would likely involve 12 aircraft.\nIn January 2019, initial operating capability for the UK's F-35B was announced with 18 F-35Bs jointly delivered to the UK. As of December 2022, 26 aircraft were operational in the UK and were based at RAF Marham. These aircraft regularly deployed for operations on the \"Queen Elizabeth-class\" aircraft carriers. Another 3 F-35s remained in the US for testing and evaluation purposes.\nWhile 39 F-35B aircraft (including 3 or 4 based in the U.S.) were in the U.K. inventory by August 2025, as the former U.K. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace had reported, the RAF and Royal Navy faced a considerable challenge in providing even the existing modest F-35B fleet with qualified pilots. As of late 2022 there were only 30 qualified British pilots (plus three exchange pilots from the United States and Australia) for the F-35. The average wait time for RAF trainee Typhoon and F-35 pilots, after completing the Military Flying Training System, was approximately 11 and 12 months respectively. A further gap of 68 weeks existed between completing Basic Flying Training and beginning Advanced Fast Jet Training. The resulting pilot shortage was a factor in delaying the ability to stand up the first Fleet Air Arm Squadron (809 Squadron) on a timely basis. In February 2023, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston, reported that the number of F-35 pilots had grown to 34 UK pilots with a further 7 to complete training by August 2023. However, in 2025 the National Audit Office (NAO) reported that a consistent shortage of pilots remained, along with other shortages including of F-35 engineers.\nUnder plans confirmed in the 2025 defence review, the Fleet Air Arm and Royal Air Force plan to acquire 47 F-35B aircraft by 2026, increasing to 62 F-35B airframes by 2033. These numbers were somewhat lower than originally envisaged due to a decision made in the review to acquire 12 non-carrier capable F-35A aircraft to serve in training and tactical nuclear-strike roles, rather than additional F-35Bs.\nTraining.\nFour types of fixed wing aircraft are operated by the FAA for training purposes: Pilot Grading is carried out using the Grob Tutor T1. Elementary flying training is then conducted on the Grob Prefect T1. From there, pilots are streamed to either Rotary or Fast-Jet.\nObserver grading and training is done using four Beechcraft Avenger T1 before observers join their frontline aircraft.\nRotary.\nToday the largest section of the FAA is the rotary wing section. Pilots designated for rotary wing service train under No. 1 Flying Training School at RAF Shawbury. The school is a tri-Service organisation consisting of civilian and military instructors (including Naval instructors and a Naval Air Squadron) that take the student from basic flying through to more advanced flying such as instrument flying, navigation, formation and captaincy.\nIts aviators fly one of four types of helicopters:\nCommando Merlin.\nThe HC4/4A AW101 Merlin (nicknamed \"Junglie Merlin\") serves as a medium lifter and troop transporter in support of the Royal Marines. The FAA received the Merlin HC3/HC3A fleet from the RAF, replacing the Commando Sea King in September 2014. These have been marinised and replaced with HC4s/HC4As, under the Merlin Life Sustainment Programme (MLSP) that was placed on contract in December 2013.\nCommando Wildcat AH1.\nThe AW159 Wildcat: the BRH (Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter) replaces the Westland Lynx as the Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter of the FAA. Along with the Commando Merlin, these squadrons operate under Commando Helicopter Force, which provides airborne support to UK Commando Force of the Royal Marines.\nWildcat HMA2.\nThe Wildcat HMA2 became the standard small ship borne helicopter in the FAA, with 28 Wildcats replacing the Lynx HMA8 in 2017. Twenty-eight AW159 Wildcat HMA2 helicopters perform a range of roles including anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare and airborne surveillance.\nMerlin HM2.\nThe Merlin HM2 (\"Grey Merlin\") is the FAA's primary anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter, having replaced the Sea King HAS6 in the role. It is presently deployed with various ships of the Royal Navy. \nMerlin HM2 also incorporates an airborne early warning and surveillance (AEW) variant, known as Crowsnest, which replaced the ASaC7 variant of the Sea King. The first Merlin HM2 test flight with Crowsnest was completed in April 2019. However, initial operating capability of the system was significantly delayed. While Crowsnest was deployed with the U.K. carrier strike group in 2021, it experienced operating challenges and finally achieved initial operating capability in July 2023. Full operating capability was achieved in 2025. While all Merlins in the Royal Navy will be equipped to operate Crowsnest, only ten kits for the system are being acquired. It has been reported that initially five Merlins will be equipped with Crowsnest, three of these being normally assigned to the \"high readiness\" aircraft carrier. Challenges involved in the Crowsnest program have led the Royal Navy to seek a replacement for its helicopter-based AEW platform with a new fixed-wing UAV, under Project Vixen, by 2030. \nIn 2025, nine Merlin HM2s from 820 Squadron were specifically assigned to embark on HMS Prince of Wales as part of the Royal Navy's carrier strike group deployment to the Indo-Pacific region. Six of the Merlins deployed in the ASW role and three in the AEW role.\nUnmanned.\nAs of 2024, the Royal Navy operated a number of small UAVs, including the AeroVironment Puma AE and Ebee Vision. In 2024, the Navy reported that there were a total of nine qualified Puma teams, six of which were dedicated to supporting the Royal Marines in 40 and 45 Commando. As of 2024, a total of 75 Puma AE, 15 Puma LE (long endurance) and 39 AeroVironment Wasp III UAVs were in the U.K. inventory. \nThe FAA's inventory was further boosted with the addition of the Peregrine rotary-wing UAV which started trials on HMS Lancaster in August 2024. In 2025 it was announced that, as part of its deployment east of Suez, HMS Prince of Wales (R09) will carry a small fleet of Malloy Aeronautics T150 UAVs. The drone is designed to provide lightweight logistics/transport support for Royal Navy deployments. Nine T-150 drones are operated by 700X Naval Air Squadron.\nFuture.\nA number of unmanned systems are under development for the Fleet Air Arm including fixed-wing UAVs, envisaged for potential operation from the \"Queen Elizabeth\"-class carriers. These programs are in the conceptual or planning stages under a program known as Project Vixen.\nSquadrons and flights.\nA Fleet Air Arm flying squadron is formally titled Naval Air Squadron (NAS), a title used as a suffix to the squadron number. The FAA assigns numbers in the 700\u2013799 range to training and operational conversion squadrons and numbers in the 800\u2013899 range to operational squadrons. Exceptions to the 700\u2013799 include operational conversion squadrons which also hold some form of operational commitment where they are then titled 800\u2013899. During WWII the 1700 and 1800 ranges were also used for operational squadrons.\nAn additional flying unit of the Royal Navy is the FOST Helicopter Support Unit based at HMS \"Raleigh\" in Cornwall. This unit is not part of the Fleet Air Arm, but is directly under the control of Fleet Operational Sea Training, operated by British International Helicopters (BIH). BIH also support various Royal Navy and NATO exercises with passenger and freight transfer services and transfers by hoist, for ships exercising both in the Atlantic and the North Sea.\nThe Royal Navy share both operational and training duties on the Lightning II with the RAF under a banner organisation called the Lightning Force, which will operate in the same manner as Joint Force Harrier.\nUntil March 2019, the Fleet Air Arm had responsibility for the Royal Navy Historic Flight, a heritage unit of airworthy aircraft representing the history of aviation in the Royal Navy. The Historic Flight was disbanded on 31 March 2019, with responsibility for maintaining and operating the aircraft transferred to Navy Wings, a charitable body that also runs the Fly Navy Heritage Trust.\nNotable members.\nSome 64 naval pilots and nine observers have reached flag rank in the Royal Navy and four Royal Marines pilots general rank in the Royal Marines. Four of these admirals with pilot's 'wings' were air engineering officers (test pilots) and two were supply officers; two of the non-executive officers reached four-star rank: a supply officer, Admiral Sir Brian Brown (1934\u2013), and a Royal Marine, General Sir Peter Whiteley (1920\u20132016).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in San Francisco in 1966, by LaVey, it is considered the \"oldest satanic religion in continual existence\", and more importantly the most influential, inspiring \"numerous imitator and breakaway groups\". According to the Church, Satanism has been \"codified\" as \"a religion and philosophy\" by LaVey and his church. Founded in an era when there was much public interest in the occult, witchcraft and Satanism, the church enjoyed a heyday for several years after its founding. Celebrities attended LaVey's satanic parties and he was invited on talk shows. His \"Satanic Bible\" sold nearly a million copies.\nLaVey was the church's High Priest until his death in 1997. In 2001, Peter H. Gilmore was appointed to the position of high priest, and the church's headquarters were moved to Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, New York City. Members do not believe that Satan literally exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive archetype embracing the Hebrew root of the word \"Satan\" as \"adversary\", who represents pride, carnality, and enlightenment, humanity's natural instincts which Abrahamic faiths have wrongly suppressed. According to High Priest Peter H. Gilmore, Satan is \"a name for the reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will\". In LaVey's book, \"The Satanic Bible\", the Satanist's concept of a God is described as the Satanist's true \"self\"\u2014 a projection of their own personality, not an external deity. Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism.\nThe Church dismisses the idea of a \"Satanic Community\" and does not share membership lists with its members, arguing members are \"radical individualists\" who \"may share very little in common beyond\" being Satanists. The Church rejects the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists. Scholars agree that there is no reliably documented case of Satanic continuity prior to the founding of the Church of Satan. It was the first organized church in modern times to be devoted to the figure of Satan, and according to Faxneld and Petersen, the Church represented \"the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organization which propounded a coherent satanic discourse\".\nBeliefs.\nLaVey described his religion as \"just Ayn Rand's philosophy with ceremony and ritual added\"; similarly, sociologist of religion James R. Lewis described it as \"a blend of Epicureanism and Ayn Rand's philosophy, flavored with a pinch of ritual magic.\" There is no belief in nor worship of the Devil or a Christian notion of Satan. High priest Peter Gilmore describes its members as \"skeptical atheists\", indicating the Hebrew root of the word \"Satan\" as \"adversary\" or \"opposer.\" Gilmore rejects the legitimacy of theistic Satanists, who believe Satan to be a supernatural being or force that may be contacted or supplicated to, dubbing them \"devil worshipers\". In an interview with David Shankbone, Gilmore stated \"My real feeling is that anybody who believes in supernatural entities on some level is insane. Whether they believe in the Devil or God, they are abdicating reason.\" He added, \"Satanism begins with atheism. We begin with the universe and say, 'It's indifferent. There's no God, there's no Devil. No one cares!'\" According to Gilmore, \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe church has stated its contention that they are the first formally organized religion to adopt the term \"Satanism\" and describes the term \"Theistic Satanism\" as \"oxymoronic\".\nLaVey's views on magic were ambiguous. He insisted Satanism was a \"materialist philosophy\" but also often talked of magic.\nHe included this rule in his \"Rules of the Earth\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLaVey also often talked of a \"Satanic magical formula\" of \"nine parts respectability to one part outrageousness\", Satanism requiring some element of sinisterness, but not so much as to put off potential congregants. The \"Rules of the Earth\" in LaVey's Satanic Bible specifically prohibited unwanted sexual advances and harming animals or children, but the Church also \"often featured a nude woman serving as an altar\" in its black masses.\nThough not emphasizing social or political causes, like Ayn Rand, LaVey explicitly opposed egalitarianism and supported social stratification, calling for the end of the \"myth of 'equality'\", which only \"supports the weak at the expense of the strong\". But he also suggested that in loving themselves, hedonists developed the ability to love others. He was quoted as saying, \"If Satanists didn't care, they wouldn't be so dark and pessimistic.\"\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nIn the 1960s Anton Szandor LaVey formed a group called the Order of the Trapezoid, which later became the governing body of the Church of Satan. The group included: \"The Baroness\" Carin de Plessen, Dr. Cecil Nixon, Kenneth Anger, San Francisco city assessor Russell Wolden, and Donald Werby. According to the Church of Satan historiography, other LaVey associates from this time include noted science fiction and horror writers Anthony Boucher, August Derleth, Robert Barbour Johnson, Reginald Bretnor, Emil Petaja, Stuart Palmer, Clark Ashton Smith, Forrest J. Ackerman, and Fritz Leiber Jr.\nThe Church of Satan was established at the Black House in San Francisco, California, on Walpurgisnacht, April 30, 1966, by LaVey, who was the church's High Priest until his death in 1997.\nIn the first year of its foundation, LaVey and the Church of Satan publicly performed a Satanic marriage of Judith Case and journalist John Raymond. The ceremony was attended by Joe Rosenthal. LaVey performed the first publicly recorded Satanic baptism in history for his youngest daughter Zeena, which garnered worldwide publicity and was originally recorded on \"The Satanic Mass\" LP. A Satanic funeral for naval machinist-repairman, third-class Edward Olsen, was performed at the request of his wife, complete with an honor guard.\nThe Church of Satan was the subject of a number of books, magazine and newspaper articles during the 1960s and 1970s. It is also the subject of a documentary, \"Satanis\" (1970). LaVey appeared in Kenneth Anger's film \"Invocation of My Demon Brother\", acted as technical adviser on \"The Devil's Rain\", which starred Ernest Borgnine, William Shatner, and introduced John Travolta. The Church of Satan was also featured in a segment of Luigi Scattini's film \"Angeli Bianchi, Angeli Neri\", released in the United States as \"Witchcraft '70\".\nOne attempt to establish the church abroad was done in connection with Maarten Lamers of the Netherlands who read The Satanic Bible and in 1971 flew to San Francisco to meet LaVey. Back in Amsterdam, Lamers established the first CoS grotto outside the U.S. -- the Magistralis Grotto or the \"Kerk van Satan\". The \"Kerk\" was in the Red Light District and connected to a club called Walpurga Abbey where customers could pay by the minute to observe \"monastic sisters\" of the Abbey masturbate on stage. Lamers insisted that since the sisters were \"performing religious acts of sexual magic\", Walpurga Abbey was tax-exempt. The Dutch government disagreed and in 1987, \"after a decade of police raids and legal battles\", Lamers was compelled to pay 10 million guilders in back taxes.\nIn 1972, LaVey stopped holding weekly rituals at the Black House and announced these would be done at the local grottos. Then on September 27, 1974, he declared the end of all regional organizations and that individual members and grottos should report to the Church's Central Grotto in San Francisco. LaVey called this move \"Phase IV of his master plan\"\nSchisms.\nStarting in the early 1970s, the Church faced internal dissent and a series of schisms. The first breakaway was by the Babylonian Grotto and its leader Wayne West, who LaVey excommunicated. A bigger schism happened with the excommunication of the Stygian Grotto, whose leader established the Church of Satanic Brotherhood in 1973 with units in Dayton, Indianapolis, Louisville, New York City, and St. Petersburg (FL). From the Church's Belphegor Grotto, another splinter group created the Order of the Black Goat, which was allegedly neo-Nazi in orientation, led by Michael Grumbowski. A later, more resilient offshoot was the World Church of Satanic Liberation, which ran from 1986 to 2011.\nIn 1975, the Church of Satan underwent a significant fracture. Michael Archy Aquino, the editor of the church newsletter and a fairly high level leader in the church, who disagreed with LaVey's changes, left to found the Temple of Set, taking a significant portion of the CoS leadership with him. This schism involved the largest Church branch, the Nineveh Grotto in NJ, and the Lilith Grotto in NY, among others. The Temple of Set reportedly had more than 500 members at its founding, although Anton LaVey claimed that only 29 people left.\nLaVey announced that the Temple of Set schism was not a setback but \"Phase V\" of his master plan, however, according to author Amina Lap, from this point on Satanism became a \"splintered and disorganized movement\".\nSchisms from the Church were caused by several factors, according to sociologist Foertsch. He focused on differences in costliness or barriers to entry for members, disputes over authority and doctrine, and opportunities for niche development in the American counter-culture world of occultism, and persecution of alleged Satanists during the moral panic (described below) of the 1980s.\nThe same year LaVey painted the Black House beige to lessen unwanted attention and \"largely retired from public life\". (In 1986, the Black House was repainted black.) According to at least one critic, James R. Lewis, LaVey was not instituting \"a Master Plan\" but demonstrating that he \"was not up to making the necessary personal sacrifices that being a founding prophet and leader required\" because his motives for founding the Church were personal enrichment and self-aggrandizement, not spreading some religious truth.\n1980s, early 1990s, and \"Satanic Panic\".\nIn the 1980s a phenomenon that became known as the \"Satanic Panic\" arose and the media reported concerns of criminal conspiracies by the Church of Satan. According to a report released in 2020, LaVey indicated to FBI agents who interviewed him on October 31, 1980 that he had lost interest in the Church. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"LAVEY STATED THAT HE IS WELL AWARE THAT MOST PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHURCH OF SATAN ARE IN FACT 'FANATICS, CULTISTS, AND WEIRDOES.' HE STATED HIS INTEREST IN THE CHURCH OF SATAN IS STRICTLY FROM A MONETARY POINT OF VIEW AND SPENDS HIS TIME FURNISHING INTERVIEWS, WRITING MATERIALS, AND LATELY HAS BECOME INTERESTED IN PHOTOGRAPHY.\" \nDuring the 1980s and 90s, LaVey was no longer interested in making media appearances and began a \"long period of silence\", becoming \"increasingly reclusive\". In 1985, he began sending his daughter Zeena to represent the CoS. She appeared on television and radio broadcasts (including \"The Phil Donahue Show\", \"Nightline with Ted Koppel\", \"Entertainment Tonight\", \"The Late Show\", \"Secrets &amp; Mysteries\" and \"the Sally Jesse Raphael Show\") \nto both educate about the Church and to debunk Satanic ritual abuse and any connection between those allegations and true Satanism (specifically the Church of Satan). She also became the High Priestess of the Church during this time and in 1988 married Nikolas Schreck.\nOn Walpurgisnacht 30 April 1990, Zeena formally renounced any association with the Church or LaVey, whom she now called her \"unfather,\" changing her maiden name to her then married name Schreck, the surname she retained after her divorce. Shortly after leaving the church, Zeena testified against LaVey in support of her mother's (Diane Hegarty) palimony lawsuit against LaVey. The court awarded Hegarty half of LaVey's property, forcing him to sell the Black House and bankrupting him. Zeena and her husband later joined the Temple of Set for a time but in 2002 she resigned and formed the Sethian Liberation Movement. \nIn the 1990s remaining members of the Church of Satan became active in media appearances to refute allegations of criminal activity. Members of the Church who were active in producing movies, music, films, and magazines devoted to Satanism include Adam Parfrey's Feral House publishing, the musician Boyd Rice, musician King Diamond, and the filmmaker Nick Bougas (a.k.a. A. Wyatt Mann).\nIn 1994, Kenneth Lanning, an FBI expert in investigating child sexual abuse, produced a report on Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) aimed at child protection authorities, which stated that despite hundreds of investigations, no corroboration of SRA had been found. Following this report, several convictions based on SRA allegations were overturned and the defendants released.\nAfter LaVey.\nAfter Anton Szandor LaVey's death on October 29, 1997, the role of High Priest was empty for some time. On November 7, 1997 Karla LaVey made a press release about continuing the church with fellow high priestess Blanche Barton. Barton eventually received ownership of the organization, which she held for 4 years. Karla LaVey ultimately left the Church of Satan and founded First Satanic Church. On October 16, 2001, the Black House, the original home of the Church, was demolished after a fundraising effort failed to raise enough to buy it. (In 1992, LaVey had sold the house to a real estate developer to raise money to settle a divorce but the developer allowed LaVey to continue to live in the house for free.)\nIn 2001, Blanche ceded her position to longtime members Peter H. Gilmore and Peggy Nadramia, the current High Priest and High Priestess and publishers of \"The Black Flame\", the official magazine of The Church of Satan, who managed an active CoS group in New York. The Central Office of the Church of Satan has also moved from San Francisco to New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, where the couple resides. The Church of Satan does not recognize any other organizations as holding legitimate claim to Satanism and its practice, though it does recognize that one need not be a member of the Church of Satan to be a Satanist.\nIn October 2004, the Royal Navy officially recognised its first registered Satanist, 24-year-old Chris Cranmer, as a technician aboard .\n6/6/06 High Mass.\nOn June 6, 2006, the Church of Satan held the first public ritual Satanic Mass in 40 years at the Steve Allen Theater in the Center for Inquiry in Los Angeles. The date corresponds to the number of the Beast, 666, from the biblical Book of Revelation. The ritual, based on the rites outlined in \"The Satanic Bible\" and \"The Satanic Rituals\", was conducted by Reverend Bryan Moore and Priestess Heather Saenz.\nThe event was by invitation only, and over one hundred members of the Church of Satan from around the world filled the theatre to capacity. Many members of the Church of Satan were interviewed by the BBC with permission. The music for the mass was created and performed by Lustmord and was subsequently released on his album \"Rising\".\nExample of law abidingness.\nIn December 2007 the Associated Press reported on a story concerning the Church of Satan, in which a teenager had sent an email to High Priest Gilmore stating he wanted to \"kill in the name of our unholy lord Satan\". Gilmore then reported the message to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who informed local police, who arrested the teenager.\n\"Realm of Satan\" documentary.\nIn January 2024, the film \"Realm of Satan\" was shown at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is similar to a documentary, though it consists primarily of scenes staged with members of the Church of Satan. One reviewer described it as \"an 80-minute art installation in which Satanists are rendered\u2014and deliberately render themselves\u2014performative characters in a diabolical play of their own making.\" The film is directed by Scott Cummings and it shows a variety of satanic rituals, which may have been performed for the film alone.\nMembership.\nThe Church of Satan claims they do not solicit memberships nor proselytize. Individuals seeking membership must be legally defined as adults in their nation of residence. As of at least January 2023, no one \"under the legal age of consent\" may join the Church of Satan, with the exception those whose \"parents or legal guardians are already members in good standing\".\nActive Members begin at the First Degree. One must apply and be approved for an Active Membership, and this is subject to one's answers to a lengthy series of questions. One cannot apply for higher Degrees, and the requirements for each degree are not open to the public. Promotion to a higher degree is by invitation only. Members of the Third through Fifth degrees constitute the Priesthood and may be addressed as \"Reverend\" (although the titles of \"Magister/Magistra\" and \"Magus/Maga\" are more often used when referring to members of the Fourth and Fifth Degrees, respectively). Members of the Fifth degree may also be known as \"Doctor\", although \"The Doctor\" usually refers to LaVey. Memberships may be terminated at the discretion of the ruling body of the Church of Satan consisting of the High Priest, the High Priestess and the Council of Nine.\nThe church emphasizes that one does not have to join the organization to consider themselves a Satanist, and that one only needs to recognize themselves in The Satanic Bible and live according to the tenets outlined therein.\nAs the Church of Satan does not publicly release membership information, it is not known how many members belong to the Church. However, according to an interview with the Church of Satan, \"interest in the Church of Satan and Satanism is growing all the time if our mailboxes, answering and fax machines, and e-mail is any indication.\" Another source (\"The Washington Post\") states the church claimed to have \"hundreds of thousands\" of members. \nHowever, according to Joseph Laycock, the Church grew rapidly in its first five years before declining, and had an estimated 250 members (according to one source). According to \"The Washington Post\", up until at least 1998, Church membership was never totaled \"more than 300\".\nHierarchy.\nThe church follows a formulated system of degrees based on meritocracy. These degrees are not open to application or to request and are only awarded to those who demonstrate excellence in the understanding and communication of Satanic Theory coupled with personal achievements in the outside world.\nThese degrees are:\nAgents of the Church of Satan are individuals who have been trained to serve as contacts for local media and other interested parties.\nPriesthood of Mendes and Council of Nine.\nMembers of the Priesthood make up the Council of Nine, which is the ruling body of the Church of Satan, of which Magistra Templi Rex Blanche Barton is the chair-mistress. Individuals who are part of the priesthood are those who act as spokespersons of the Church of Satan. The priesthood is exclusive to third-, fourth-, and fifth-degree members. Members of the priesthood may be referred to as \"reverend\". The High Priest and Priestess act as administrative chiefs and primary public representatives; each position (High Priest and High Priestess) is held by a single individual at a time. The current High Priest is Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priestess is Peggy Nadramia.\nThe Church of Satan evaluates active members for the Priesthood by their accomplishment in society\u2014mastered skills and peer recognition within a profession\u2014rather than by mastery of irrelevant occult trivia. While expected to be experts in communicating the Satanic philosophy, members of the Priesthood are not required to speak on behalf of the Church of Satan and may even choose to keep their affiliation and rank secret in order to better serve their personal goals, as well as those of the organization. Membership in the Priesthood is by invitation only.\nThe Grotto System.\nWithin Satanism, a Grotto is a clandestine association or gathering of Satanists within geographical proximity for means of social, ritual, and special interest activities. The Church of Satan no longer formally recognizes or charters grottos. The primary reason for the end of the Grotto system is that only a small minority of members ever participated. This was further compounded by the fact that a publicly listed Grotto defeated the ability to remain secret and unknown to the larger populace. The Grotto system was in practice replaced by social media, private online forums, and other methods for members to interact with one another outside of the need for a so-called Grotto Master and annual reports to the central office of the Church of Satan.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

In a map projection, coordinates, often expressed as latitude and longitude, of locations from the surface of the globe are transformed to coordinates on a plane.\nProjection is a necessary step in creating a two-dimensional map and is one of the essential elements of cartography.\nAll projections of a sphere on a plane necessarily distort the surface in some way. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions are acceptable and others are not; therefore, different map projections exist in order to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body at the expense of other properties. The study of map projections is primarily about the characterization of their distortions. There is no limit to the number of possible map projections.\nMore generally, projections are considered in several fields of pure mathematics, including differential geometry, projective geometry, and manifolds. However, the term \"map projection\" refers specifically to a cartographic projection.\nDespite the name's literal meaning, projection is not limited to perspective projections, such as those resulting from casting a shadow on a screen, or the rectilinear image produced by a pinhole camera on a flat film plate. Rather, any mathematical function that transforms coordinates from the curved surface distinctly and smoothly to the plane is a projection. Few projections in practical use are perspective.\nMost of this article assumes that the surface to be mapped is that of a sphere. The Earth and other large celestial bodies are generally better modeled as oblate spheroids, whereas small objects such as asteroids often have irregular shapes. The surfaces of planetary bodies can be mapped even if they are too irregular to be modeled well with a sphere or ellipsoid.\nThe most well-known map projection is the Mercator projection. This map projection has the property of being conformal. However, it has been criticized throughout the 20th century for enlarging regions further from the equator. To contrast, equal-area projections such as the Sinusoidal projection and the Gall\u2013Peters projection show the correct sizes of countries relative to each other, but distort angles. The National Geographic Society and most atlases favor map projections that compromise between area and angular distortion, such as the Robinson projection and the Winkel tripel projection.\nMetric properties of maps.\nMany properties can be measured on the Earth's surface independently of its geography:\nMap projections can be constructed to preserve some of these properties at the expense of others. Because the Earth's curved surface is not isometric to a plane, preservation of shapes inevitably requires a variable scale and, consequently, non-proportional presentation of areas. Similarly, an area-preserving projection can not be conformal, resulting in shapes and bearings distorted in most places of the map. Each projection preserves, compromises, or approximates basic metric properties in different ways. The purpose of the map determines which projection should form the base for the map. Because maps have many different purposes, a diversity of projections have been created to suit those purposes.\nAnother consideration in the configuration of a projection is its compatibility with data sets to be used on the map. Data sets are geographic information; their collection depends on the chosen datum (model) of the Earth. Different datums assign slightly different coordinates to the same location, so in large scale maps, such as those from national mapping systems, it is important to match the datum to the projection. The slight differences in coordinate assignation between different datums is not a concern for world maps or those of large regions, where such differences are reduced to imperceptibility.\nDistortion.\nCarl Friedrich Gauss's \"Theorema Egregium\" proved that a sphere's surface cannot be represented on a plane without distortion. The same applies to other reference surfaces used as models for the Earth, such as oblate spheroids, ellipsoids, and geoids. Since any map projection is a representation of one of those surfaces on a plane, all map projections distort.\nThe classical way of showing the distortion inherent in a projection is to use Tissot's indicatrix. For a given point, using the scale factor \"h\" along the meridian, the scale factor \"k\" along the parallel, and the angle \"\u03b8\"\u2032 between them, Nicolas Tissot described how to construct an ellipse that illustrates the amount and orientation of the components of distortion.24 By spacing the ellipses regularly along the meridians and parallels, the network of indicatrices shows how distortion varies across the map.\nOther distortion metrics.\nMany other ways have been described of showing the distortion in projections. Like Tissot's indicatrix, the Goldberg-Gott indicatrix is based on infinitesimals, and depicts \"flexion\" and \"skewness\" (bending and lopsidedness) distortions.\nRather than the original (enlarged) infinitesimal circle as in Tissot's indicatrix, some visual methods project finite shapes that span a part of the map.\nFor example, a small circle of fixed radius (e.g., 15 degrees angular radius). Sometimes spherical triangles are used.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, projecting a human head onto different projections was common to show how distortion varies across one projection as compared to another.\nIn dynamic media, shapes of familiar coastlines and boundaries can be dragged across an interactive map to show how the projection distorts sizes and shapes according to position on the map.\nAnother way to visualize local distortion is through grayscale or color gradations whose shade represents the magnitude of the angular deformation or areal inflation. Sometimes both are shown simultaneously by blending two colors to create a bivariate map.\nTo measure distortion globally across areas instead of at just a single point necessarily involves choosing priorities to reach a compromise. Some schemes use distance distortion as a proxy for the combination of angular deformation and areal inflation; such methods arbitrarily choose what paths to measure and how to weight them in order to yield a single result. Many have been described.\nDesign and construction.\nThe creation of a map projection involves two steps:\nSome of the simplest map projections are literal projections, as obtained by placing a light source at some definite point relative to the globe and projecting its features onto a specified surface. Although most projections are not defined in this way, picturing the light source-globe model can be helpful in understanding the basic concept of a map projection.\nChoosing a projection surface.\nA surface that can be unfolded or unrolled into a plane or sheet without stretching, tearing or shrinking is called a \"developable surface\". The cylinder, cone and the plane are all developable surfaces. The sphere and ellipsoid do not have developable surfaces, so any projection of them onto a plane will have to distort the image. (To compare, one cannot flatten an orange peel without tearing and warping it.)\nOne way of describing a projection is first to project from the Earth's surface to a developable surface such as a cylinder or cone, and then to unroll the surface into a plane. While the first step inevitably distorts some properties of the globe, the developable surface can then be unfolded without further distortion.\nAspect of the projection.\nOnce a choice is made between projecting onto a cylinder, cone, or plane, the aspect of the shape must be specified. The aspect describes how the developable surface is placed relative to the globe: it may be \"normal\" (such that the surface's axis of symmetry coincides with the Earth's axis), \"transverse\" (at right angles to the Earth's axis) or \"oblique\" (any angle in between).\nNotable lines.\nThe developable surface may also be either \"tangent\" or \"secant\" to the sphere or ellipsoid. Tangent means the surface touches but does not slice through the globe; secant means the surface does slice through the globe. Moving the developable surface away from contact with the globe never preserves or optimizes metric properties, so that possibility is not discussed further here.\nTangent and secant lines (\"standard lines\") are represented undistorted. If these lines are a parallel of latitude, as in conical projections, it is called a \"standard parallel\". The \"central meridian\" is the meridian to which the globe is rotated before projecting. The central meridian (usually written \"\u03bb\"0) and a parallel of origin (usually written \"\u03c6\"0) are often used to define the origin of the map projection.\nScale.\nA globe is the only way to represent the Earth with constant scale throughout the entire map in all directions. A map cannot achieve that property for any area, no matter how small. It can, however, achieve constant scale along specific lines.\nSome possible properties are:\nChoosing a model for the shape of the body.\nProjection construction is also affected by how the shape of the Earth or planetary body is approximated. In the following section on projection categories, the earth is taken as a sphere in order to simplify the discussion. However, the Earth's actual shape is closer to an oblate ellipsoid. Whether spherical or ellipsoidal, the principles discussed hold without loss of generality.\nSelecting a model for a shape of the Earth involves choosing between the advantages and disadvantages of a sphere versus an ellipsoid. Spherical models are useful for small-scale maps such as world atlases and globes, since the error at that scale is not usually noticeable or important enough to justify using the more complicated ellipsoid. The ellipsoidal model is commonly used to construct topographic maps and for other large- and medium-scale maps that need to accurately depict the land surface. Auxiliary latitudes are often employed in projecting the ellipsoid.\nA third model is the geoid, a more complex and accurate representation of Earth's shape coincident with what mean sea level would be if there were no winds, tides, or land. Compared to the best fitting ellipsoid, a geoidal model would change the characterization of important properties such as distance, conformality and equivalence. Therefore, in geoidal projections that preserve such properties, the mapped graticule would deviate from a mapped ellipsoid's graticule. Normally the geoid is not used as an Earth model for projections, however, because Earth's shape is very regular, with the undulation of the geoid amounting to less than 100\u00a0m from the ellipsoidal model out of the 6.3\u00a0million\u00a0m Earth radius. For irregular planetary bodies such as asteroids, however, sometimes models analogous to the geoid are used to project maps from. \nOther regular solids are sometimes used as generalizations for smaller bodies' geoidal equivalent. For example, Io is better modeled by triaxial ellipsoid or prolated spheroid with small eccentricities. Haumea's shape is a Jacobi ellipsoid, with its major axis twice as long as its minor and with its middle axis one and half times as long as its minor.\nSee map projection of the triaxial ellipsoid for further information.\nClassification.\nOne way to classify map projections is based on the type of surface onto which the globe is projected. In this scheme, the projection process is described as placing a hypothetical projection surface the size of the desired study area in contact with part of the Earth, transferring features of the Earth's surface onto the projection surface, then unraveling and scaling the projection surface into a flat map. The most common projection surfaces are cylindrical (e.g., Mercator), conic (e.g., Albers), and planar (e.g., stereographic). Many mathematical projections, however, do not neatly fit into any of these three projection methods. Hence other peer categories have been described in the literature, such as pseudoconic, pseudocylindrical, pseudoazimuthal, retroazimuthal, and polyconic.\nAnother way to classify projections is according to properties of the model they preserve. Some of the more common categories are:\nBecause the sphere is not a developable surface, it is impossible to construct a map projection that is both equal-area and conformal.\nProjections by surface.\nThe three developable surfaces (plane, cylinder, cone) provide useful models for understanding, describing, and developing map projections. However, these models are limited in two fundamental ways. For one thing, most world projections in use do not fall into any of those categories. For another thing, even most projections that do fall into those categories are not naturally attainable through physical projection. As L. P. Lee notes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLee's objection refers to the way the terms \"cylindrical\", \"conic\", and \"planar\" (azimuthal) have been abstracted in the field of map projections. If maps were projected as in light shining through a globe onto a developable surface, then the spacing of parallels would follow a very limited set of possibilities. Such a cylindrical projection (for example) is one which:\nWhere the light source emanates along the line described in this last constraint is what yields the differences between the various \"natural\" cylindrical projections. But the term \"cylindrical\" as used in the field of map projections relaxes the last constraint entirely. Instead the parallels can be placed according to any algorithm the designer has decided suits the needs of the map. The famous Mercator projection is one in which the placement of parallels does not arise by projection; instead parallels are placed how they need to be in order to satisfy the property that a course of constant bearing is always plotted as a straight line.\nCylindrical.\nNormal cylindrical.\nA normal cylindrical projection is any projection in which meridians are mapped to equally spaced vertical lines and circles of latitude (parallels) are mapped to horizontal lines.\nThe mapping of meridians to vertical lines can be visualized by imagining a cylinder whose axis coincides with the Earth's axis of rotation. This cylinder is wrapped around the Earth, projected onto, and then unrolled.\nBy the geometry of their construction, cylindrical projections stretch distances east-west. The amount of stretch is the same at any chosen latitude on all cylindrical projections, and is given by the secant of the latitude as a multiple of the equator's scale. The various cylindrical projections are distinguished from each other solely by their north-south stretching (where latitude is given by \u03c6):\nIn the first case (Mercator), the east-west scale always equals the north-south scale. In the second case (central cylindrical), the north-south scale exceeds the east-west scale everywhere away from the equator. Each remaining case has a pair of secant lines\u2014a pair of identical latitudes of opposite sign (or else the equator) at which the east-west scale matches the north-south-scale.\nNormal cylindrical projections map the whole Earth as a finite rectangle, except in the first two cases, where the rectangle stretches infinitely tall while retaining constant width.\nTransverse cylindrical.\nA transverse cylindrical projection is a cylindrical projection that in the tangent case uses a great circle along a meridian as contact line for the cylinder.\nSee: transverse Mercator.\nOblique cylindrical.\nAn oblique cylindrical projection aligns with a great circle, but not the equator and not a meridian.\nPseudocylindrical.\nPseudocylindrical projections represent the \"central\" meridian as a straight line segment. Other meridians are longer than the central meridian and bow outward, away from the central meridian. Pseudocylindrical projections map parallels as straight lines. Along parallels, each point from the surface is mapped at a distance from the central meridian that is proportional to its difference in longitude from the central meridian. Therefore, meridians are equally spaced along a given parallel. On a pseudocylindrical map, any point further from the equator than some other point has a higher latitude than the other point, preserving north-south relationships. This trait is useful when illustrating phenomena that depend on latitude, such as climate. Examples of pseudocylindrical projections include:\nHybrid.\nThe HEALPix projection combines an equal-area cylindrical projection in equatorial regions with the Collignon projection in polar areas.\nConic.\nThe term \"conic projection\" is used to refer to any projection in which meridians are mapped to equally spaced lines radiating out from the apex and circles of latitude (parallels) are mapped to circular arcs centered on the apex.\nWhen making a conic map, the map maker arbitrarily picks two standard parallels. Those standard parallels may be visualized as secant lines where the cone intersects the globe\u2014or, if the map maker chooses the same parallel twice, as the tangent line where the cone is tangent to the globe. The resulting conic map has low distortion in scale, shape, and area near those standard parallels. Distances along the parallels to the north of both standard parallels or to the south of both standard parallels are stretched; distances along parallels between the standard parallels are compressed. When a single standard parallel is used, distances along all other parallels are stretched.\nConic projections that are commonly used are:\nAzimuthal (projections onto a plane).\nAzimuthal projections have the property that directions from a central point are preserved and therefore great circles through the central point are represented by straight lines on the map. These projections also have radial symmetry in the scales and hence in the distortions: map distances from the central point are computed by a function \"r\"(\"d\") of the true distance \"d\", independent of the angle; correspondingly, circles with the central point as center are mapped into circles which have as center the central point on the map.\nThe mapping of radial lines can be visualized by imagining a plane tangent to the Earth, with the central point as tangent point.\nThe radial scale is \"r\u2032\"(\"d\") and the transverse scale \"r\"(\"d\")/(\"R\"\u00a0sin\u00a0) where \"R\" is the radius of the Earth.\nSome azimuthal projections are true perspective projections; that is, they can be constructed mechanically, projecting the surface of the Earth by extending lines from a point of perspective (along an infinite line through the tangent point and the tangent point's antipode) onto the plane:\nOther azimuthal projections are not true perspective projections:\nPolyhedral.\nPolyhedral map projections use a polyhedron to subdivide the globe into faces, and then projects each face to the globe. The most well-known polyhedral map projection is Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion map.\nProjections by preservation of a metric property.\nConformal.\nConformal, or orthomorphic, map projections preserve angles locally, implying that they map infinitesimal circles of constant size anywhere on the Earth to infinitesimal circles of varying sizes on the map. In contrast, mappings that are not conformal distort most such small circles into ellipses of distortion. An important consequence of conformality\nis that relative angles at each point of the map are correct, and the local scale (although varying throughout the map) in every direction around any one point is constant. These are some conformal projections:\nEqual-area.\nEqual-area maps preserve area measure, generally distorting shapes in order to do so. Equal-area maps are also called \"equivalent\" or \"authalic\". These are some projections that preserve area:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEquidistant.\nIf the length of the line segment connecting two projected points on the plane is proportional to the geodesic (shortest surface) distance between the two unprojected points on the globe, then we say that distance has been preserved between those two points. An equidistant projection preserves distances from one or two special points to all other points. The special point or points may get stretched into a line or curve segment when projected. In that case, the point on the line or curve segment closest to the point being measured to must be used to measure the distance.\nGnomonic.\nGreat circles are displayed as straight lines:\nRetroazimuthal.\nDirection to a fixed location B (the bearing at the starting location A of the shortest route) corresponds to the direction on the map from A to B:\nCompromise projections.\nCompromise projections give up the idea of perfectly preserving metric properties, seeking instead to strike a balance between distortions, or to simply make things look right. Most of these types of projections distort shape in the polar regions more than at the equator. These are some compromise projections:\nSuitability of projections for application.\nThe mathematics of projection do not permit any particular map projection to be best for everything. Something will always be distorted. Thus, many projections exist to serve the many uses of maps and their vast range of scales.\nModern national mapping systems typically employ a transverse Mercator or close variant for large-scale maps in order to preserve conformality and low variation in scale over small areas. For smaller-scale maps, such as those spanning continents or the entire world, many projections are in common use according to their fitness for the purpose, such as Winkel tripel, Robinson and Mollweide. Reference maps of the world often appear on compromise projections. Due to distortions inherent in any map of the world, the choice of projection becomes largely one of aesthetics.\nThematic maps normally require an equal area projection so that phenomena per unit area are shown in correct proportion.\nHowever, representing area ratios correctly necessarily distorts shapes more than many maps that are not equal-area.\nThe Mercator projection, developed for navigational purposes, has often been used in world maps where other projections would have been more appropriate. This problem has long been recognized even outside professional circles. For example, a 1943 \"New York Times\" editorial states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA controversy in the 1980s over the Peters map motivated the American Cartographic Association (now the Cartography and Geographic Information Society) to produce a series of booklets (including \"Which Map Is Best\") designed to educate the public about map projections and distortion in maps. In 1989 and 1990, after some internal debate, seven North American geographic organizations adopted a resolution recommending against using any rectangular projection (including Mercator and Gall\u2013Peters) for reference maps of the world.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was originally broadcast on ABC from September 30, 1960, to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series with a prime-time slot on television, as well as the first animated sitcom.\nThe show follows the lives of Fred and Wilma Flintstone and their pet dinosaur, Dino, a Sabre Tooth Tiger-Cat named Baby Puss, and they later on have a baby girl named Pebbles. Barney and Betty Rubble are their neighbors and best friends, and later on adopt a super-strong baby boy named Bamm-Bamm and acquire a pet hopparoo (kangaroo) called Hoppy.\nProducers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who had earned seven Academy Awards for \"Tom and Jerry\", and their staff faced a challenge in developing a thirty-minute animated program with one storyline that fit the parameters of family-based domestic situation comedies of the era. After considering several settings and selecting the Stone Age, one of several inspirations was \"The Honeymooners\" (which was itself influenced by \"The Bickersons\" and Laurel and Hardy). Hanna considered \"The Honeymooners\" to be one of the finest comedies on television.\nThe enduring popularity of \"The Flintstones\" mainly comes from its juxtaposition of modern, everyday concerns with the Stone Age setting. Its animation required a balance of visual with verbal storytelling that the studio created and others imitated.\n\"The Flintstones\" was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades. In 2013, \"TV Guide\" ranked \"The Flintstones\" the second greatest TV cartoon of all time, behind only \"The Simpsons\".\nOverview.\nThe show is set in a comical version of the Stone Age, with features and technologies that resemble mid-20th-century suburbia in the United States. The plots deliberately resemble the sitcoms of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of Bedrock (pop. 2,500), where dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures are portrayed as co-existing with cavepeople, saber-toothed cats, woolly rhinoceroses, and woolly mammoths.\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series partly draws its humor from anachronism, mainly the placing of a \"modern\" 20th-century society in prehistory which takes inspiration from the suburban sprawl developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances which work by employing animals. It also has automobiles, but they mostly do not resemble the cars of the 20th century, as they are large wooden and rock structures powered by people who run while inside them. This depiction varies according to the needs of the story; on some occasions, the cars appear to have engines, requiring ignition keys and some representation of gasoline. Fred might pull into a gas station and say, \"Fill 'er up with Ethel\", which is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL\". As well, the stone houses of this society are cookie-cutter homes positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.\nCharacters.\nOther characters.\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the series. Below are those who have made more than one appearance:\nVoice-actor details.\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, Alan Reed, and Jackie Gleason, whose series, \"The Honeymooners\", inspired \"The Flintstones\". The voice of Barney Rubble was provided by voice actor Mel Blanc, except for five episodes during the second season (the first, second, fifth, sixth, and ninth); Hanna-Barbera regular Daws Butler filled in and provided the voice of Barney while Blanc was incapacitated by a near-fatal car accident in 1961. Blanc was able to return to the series sooner than expected because a temporary recording studio for the cast was set up at his bedside. Blanc's Barney voice varied from nasally to deep before the accident, as he and Barbera, who directed the sessions with Alan Dinehart, explored the right level in relation to comedy and other characters. Blanc uses both Barney voices in one of the earliest episodes, \"The Prowler.\"\nReed was insistent on playing Fred in a relatively natural speaking voice, rather than a broad, \"cartoony\" style. Few animated short cartoons used this \"straightforward\" method, except for experimental studios like UPA and feature films with more realistic characters. The performances of Reed and the cast, combined with the writing, helped to ground the animated world of \"The Flintstones\" in a relatable reality. The dialogue style of \"The Flintstones\" set a precedent for acting in animation that continues to exist today, and is sometimes falsely attributed in modern animated productions as \"revolutionary.\"\nIn a 1986 \"Playboy\" interview, Gleason said that Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies, and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying \"The Honeymooners\", but decided to let it pass. According to Henry Corden, a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's (who would subsequently take over the role of Fred from Reed after his death in 1977), \"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have \"The Flintstones\" pulled right off the air. But they also told him, 'Do you want to be known as the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air? The guy who took away a show so many kids love and so many parents love, too?'\"\nHenry Corden first spoke for Fred Flintstone on the 1965 record album \"Songs From Mary Poppins\", then continued doing the voice for most other Flintstone records on the label. Around the same time, Corden was providing Fred's singing voice in two films being produced at the studio: the 1966 special \"Alice in Wonderland, or What's a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This?\" and the 1966 feature film \"The Man Called Flintstone\". Corden assumed the role completely after Reed's death in 1977, starting with the TV special, \"A Flintstone Christmas\".\nSince 2000, Jeff Bergman, James Arnold Taylor, and Scott Innes, who performs both Fred and Barney for Toshiba commercials, have performed the voice of Fred. Since Mel Blanc's death in 1989, Barney has been voiced by Jeff Bergman, Frank Welker, Scott Innes, and Kevin Michael Richardson. Various additional character voices were performed by Hal Smith, Allan Melvin, Janet Waldo, Daws Butler, and Howard Morris, among others.\nMusic.\nThe opening and closing credits theme during the first two seasons was \"Rise and Shine\", a lively instrumental underscore accompanying Fred on his drive home from work. Starting in season three, episode three (\"Barney the Invisible\"), the opening and closing credits theme was \"Meet the Flintstones\". This version was recorded with a 22-piece big band conducted by composer Hoyt Curtin and performed by the Randy Van Horne Singers. The melody is derived from part of the 'B' section of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 17 Movement 2, composed in 1801/02. \"Meet the Flintstones\" was later used in the first two seasons in syndication. The musical underscores were credited to Hoyt Curtin for the show's first five seasons; Ted Nichols took over in 1965 for the final season. Many early episodes used the underscores composed for \"Top Cat\" and \"The Jetsons\". Episodes of the last two seasons used the underscore of \"Jonny Quest\" for the more adventurous stories.\nHistory and production.\nThe idea of \"The Flintstones\" started after Hanna-Barbera produced \"The Huckleberry Hound Show\" and \"The Quick Draw McGraw Show\", which were successful. However, they did not appeal to a wide audience like their previous theatrical cartoon series \"Tom and Jerry\", which entertained both children and adults. Since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's programs became labeled \"kids only\". Hanna and Barbera wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated situation comedy.\nHanna and Barbera considered making the two families hillbillies, a theme which was later incorporated into two episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", ancient Romans, an idea which was later developed into \"The Roman Holidays\", pilgrims, and Native Americans before deciding on a Stone Age setting. According to Barbera, they settled on the Stone Age because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\". Under the working title \"The Flagstones\", a treatment was written by Harry Winkler. The family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.\nIt was a difficult sell, and required eight weeks of daily presentations to networks and ad agencies. June Foray and Hanna-Barbera regular Daws Butler voiced the characters for the demonstration film, but Foray was dropped without warning before production began; Foray was upset about the rejection and refused to work with Hanna-Barbera for many years afterward, despite Barbera's efforts to offer her other work. Animator Kenneth Muse, who worked on the \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of \"The Flintstones\".\nWilliam Hanna was honest about the inspiration, saying, \"At that time, \"The Honeymooners\" was the most popular show on the air, and for my bill, the funniest. The characters, I thought, were terrific. Now, that influenced greatly what we did with \"The Flintstones\" ... \"The Honeymooners\" was there, and we used that as a kind of basis for the concept.\" Joseph Barbera disavowed these claims in a separate interview, stating, \"I don't remember mentioning \"The Honeymooners\" when I sold the show, but if people want to compare \"The Flintstones\" to \"The Honeymooners\", then great. It's a total compliment. \"The Honeymooners\" was one of the greatest shows ever written.\"\nJackie Gleason, creator of \"The Honeymooners\", considered suing Hanna-Barbera Productions, but decided not to since he did not want to be known as \"the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air\". Gleason was sued because \"The Honeymooners\" was similar to \"The Bickersons\", as critics noted at the time, but the lawsuit served by \"Bickersons\" creator Philip Rapp was ultimately settled out of court. Another influence was noted during Hanna-Barbera's tenure at MGM, where they were in a friendly competition with fellow cartoon director Tex Avery. In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"The First Bad Man\", narrated by cowboy legend Tex Ritter, which was about the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age Dallas. Many sight gags from \"The First Bad Man\" antedated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in \"The\" \"Flintstones\" by many years. Therefore, students of American animation call \"The First Bad Man\" a progenitive seed of \"The\" \"Flintstones\".\nThe concept was also antedated by the \"Stone Age Cartoons\", a series of 12 animated cartoons which Fleischer Studios released from January to September 1940. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means, such as \"Granite Hotel\" including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show. So we developed two storyboards; one was they had a helicopter of some kind and they went to the opera or whatever, and the other was Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble fighting over a swimming pool. So I go back to New York with a portfolio and two half-hour boards. And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did Bristol-Myers, the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys...\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.\nWhen the series entered production, the working title \"The Flagstones\" was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, the main characters in the comic strip \"Hi and Lois\". After spending a brief period in development as \"The Gladstones\" (GLadstone being a Los Angeles telephone exchange at the time), Hanna-Barbera settled upon \"The Flintstones\", and the idea of the Flintstones having a child from the start was discarded, with Fred and Wilma starting out as a childless couple. However, some early \"Flintstones\" merchandise, such as a 1961 Little Golden Book, included \"Fred Jr\".\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences. This was reflected in the comedy, which resembled the primetime sitcoms of the era, with family issues resolved at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a laugh track. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer Joanna Lee. However, they still used traditional animation writers, such as Warren Foster and Michael Maltese.\n\"The Flintstones\" premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. The first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first sitcom: 1947's \"Mary Kay and Johnny.\"\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by Winston cigarettes and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston. This was dictated by the custom, at that time, that the stars of a TV series often \"pitched\" their sponsor's product in an \"integrated commercial\" at the end of the episode.\nDuring the third season, Hanna and Barbera decided that Fred and Wilma should have a baby. Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, but the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\". Although most \"Flintstones\" episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a story arc surrounding the birth of Pebbles. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season, in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles's birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\", and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and Welch's grape juice and grape jellies became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift towards a younger demographic. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars that were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and other characters from the show. In Australia, the Nine Network ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past \"Flintstone\" episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios. Another arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own, adopt Bamm-Bamm. This made \"The Flintstones\" the first animated series to address the issue of infertility, though subtly. The 100th episode made but the 90th to air, \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\", established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it, but aired afterward, which is why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\". However, Bamm-Bamm did appear in a teaser in episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\". Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo.\nAfter Pebbles's birth, the audience demographic expanded and the series was marketed as a family series rather than the \"adult\" animated show of the earlier seasons. As a result of a wider number of yearly viewers, including children, and competition from TV's trend toward fantasy shows, the episodes varied from family comedy to fantasy/adventure, but still had stories about couple dynamics. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.\nBroadcast history.\nAlthough \"The Flintstones\" was produced in color for its entire run, ABC broadcast the show only in black-and-white for the first two seasons. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised \"The Flintstones\" in color, making it one of the first programs in color to air on the network. The first three seasons of \"The Flintstones\" aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC. Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30, while the rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\nIn the U.S., \"The Flintstones\" was part of NBC Saturday mornings from 1966 to 1970, with syndicated reruns offered to local stations until 1997, when E/I regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of Ted Turner's purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, TBS, TNT, and Cartoon Network aired the program. In September 2003, the program moved to Boomerang, where it has continued to air regularly as of 2025 with some interruptions. Online, the series was made available on the In2TV service beginning in 2006, then the online version of Kids' WB until it was discontinued in 2015. As of 2017, full episodes are available in the U.S. on Boomerang's subscription video-on-demand service, with select clips made available on the official YouTube account tied to the revamped Kids' WB website. In 2019, MeTV acquired rerun rights to the series, returning the show to broadcast television for the first time in over 20 years, first airing on its main channel and then its new channel MeTV Toons in 2024. Until 2025, the series streamed in full and then in part on Max, a streaming service owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. The complete series can be found on Tubi, a streaming service owned by Fox Corporation. As of August 1, 2024, the program can also be found in full on Hulu.\nIn Canada, \"The Flintstones\" first aired Monday nights at 9:00 Eastern time on CBC Television until the third season when it moved to the CTV Television Network. At the time, CTV aired the show at different evening time slots throughout its last three seasons. Syndicated reruns were also offered to local stations until the early-1990s. The show was also later carried overtime on YTV, Teletoon Retro, Cartoon Network, and Boomerang, alongside French channels ICI, TQS, TVA, and Prise 2. \nWhen independent broadcaster ITV first aired \"The Flintstones\" to England in January 1961, the program slowly began to spread its popularity around the world. The BBC picked up the rights for the program in 1985. The series was repeated for decades in various daytime and early evening time-slots; episodes were also sometimes used by the BBC in case of last minute schedule changes, such as coverage of sporting events being affected by bad weather. The final BBC broadcast of an episode was in 2008 on BBC Two. Additionally, the series appeared on Cartoon Network starting in the mid-1990s. Other international networks that aired the original run of the series include RTF in France, ARD in Germany, Rai 1 and Rai 2 in Italy, NTS in the Netherlands, and Fuji TV in Japan.\nReception.\nThe night after \"The Flintstones\" premiered, \"Variety\" called it \"a pen-and-ink disaster\", and the series was among many that debuted in a \"vast wasteland\" of a 1960\u201361 television season considered one of the worst in television history up to that point. As late as the 1980s, highbrow critics derided the show's limited animation and derivative plots. Animation historian Michael Barrier disliked the series, calling it a \"dumb sitcom\" and stated that \"I can readily understand why someone who as a small child enjoyed, say, \"The Flintstones\" might regard that show fondly today. I have a lot more trouble understanding why anyone would try to defend anything about it on artistic grounds.\"\nDespite the mixed critical reviews following its premiere, \"The Flintstones\" has generally been considered a television classic and was rerun continuously for five decades after its end. In 1961, \"The Flintstones\" became the first animated series to be nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost out to \"The Jack Benny Program\". In January 2009, IGN named \"The Flintstones\" as the ninth-best in its \"Top 100 Animated TV Shows\". The first season of the series received an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on nine reviews, with an average score of 6/10. Currently, several authors consider \"The Flintstones\" as a cartoon linked to the golden age of American animation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term also refers to a more specific rock and pop subgenre, originating in the United States in the late 1960s, that evolved from garage rock, novelty songs, and the Brill Building sound, and which was also defined by its target demographic of preteens and young teenagers. The Archies' 1969 hit \"Sugar, Sugar\" was a representative example that led to cartoon rock, a short-lived trend of Saturday-morning cartoon series that heavily featured pop rock songs in the bubblegum vein.\nProducer Jeffry Katz claimed credit for coining \"bubblegum\", saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was \"teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, 'Ah, this is like bubblegum music'.\" The term was then popularized by their boss, Buddah Records label executive Neil Bogart. It became often used as a pejorative for pop music that is perceived to be disposable and contrived. \nMost bubblegum acts were one-hit wonders (notable exceptions included the Cowsills, the Partridge Family and Tommy Roe) and the sound remained a significant commercial force until the early 1970s. Commentators often debate the scope of the genre and have variously argued for the exclusion or inclusion of dance-pop, disco, teen pop, boy bands, and especially the Monkees. During the 1970s, the original bubblegum sound was a formative influence on punk rock, new wave, and melodic metal.\nDefinitions.\nOccasionally invoked as a pejorative, the \"bubblegum\" descriptor has several different applications. The 2001 book \"Bubblegum Music Is the Naked Truth\" rules out teen pop or boy bands as inherently bubblegum and defines the term as:\nThe artists were typically singles acts, with songs commonly featuring sing-along choruses, seemingly childlike themes and a contrived innocence, occasionally combined with an undercurrent of sexual double entendre. Comparing bubblegum to power pop, \"Mojo\" writer Dawn Eden said: \"Power pop aims for your heart and your feet. Bubblegum aims for any part of your body it can get, as long as you buy the damn record.\" Music critic Lester Bangs described the style as \"the basic sound of rock 'n' roll \u2013 minus the rage, fear, violence and anomie\".\nThere is debate concerning which artists fit the genre, especially for cases such as the Monkees. In the opinion of music historian Bill Pitzonka: \"The whole thing that really makes a record bubblegum is just an inherently contrived innocence that somehow transcends that. [...] It has to sound like they mean it.\" Music critic David Smay argued that disco is merely bubblegum by another name and that since bubblegum is \"dance music for pre-teen girls\", the genre's scope must therefore include dance-pop and such associated figures as Stock Aitken Waterman and Kylie Minogue, but \"Not all dance-pop is aimed at kids and shouldn't be presumed to be disposable anymore than bubblegum.\"\nPrecursors.\nAccording to music historian Carl Caferelli, \"You could conceivably think of virtually every cute novelty hit, from pre-rock ditties like \"How Much Is That Doggie In The Window\" to transcendent rock-era staples like \"Iko Iko,\" as a legitimate precursor to bubblegum's avowedly ephemeral themes.\" He went on to list such \"important antecedents\" as \"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\" (Herman's Hermits, 1965), \"Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron\" (Royal Guardsmen, 1966), \"Ding, Dong! The Witch is Dead\" (the Fifth Estate, 1967), and \"Green Tambourine\" (Lemon Pipers, 1967).\nOriginal commercial peak (1968\u20131972).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"American bubblegum pop was often like garage rock's bouncy little brother: lacking the moodiness and sex appeal, but you could see the shared DNA. British bubblegum was born out of the same talent glut of session musicians and songwriters and shared a sweet tooth, but it was quite different in approach, owing rock almost nothing and rarely placing much of a premium on kid energy.\"\n \u2014Tom Ewing, \"Freaky Trigger\"\nBubblegum is generally traced to the success of the 1968 songs \"Simon Says\" by the 1910 Fruitgum Company and \"Yummy Yummy Yummy\" by the Ohio Express. Tommy James of the Shondells claims to have unknowingly invented bubblegum music in 1967 with the hit song \"I Think We're Alone Now\". Producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz have claimed credit for coining \"bubblegum\" for this music, saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was \"teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, 'Ah, this is like bubblegum music'.\" The term was seized upon by Buddah Records label executive Neil Bogart, as Pitzonka added: \"Kasenetz and Katz really crystallized [the scene] when they came up with the term themselves and that nice little analogy. And Neil Bogart, being the marketing person he was, just crammed it down the throats of people. That's really the point at which bubblegum took off.\"\nThe Archies' \"Sugar, Sugar\" became the best-selling hit of 1969 and inspired a wave of artists to adopt the bubblegum style. The song's success led to \"cartoon rock\", a short-lived trend of Saturday morning cartoon series that heavily featured pop-rock songs in the bubblegum vein. However, none of these songs had showings on the pop charts when released as singles, except for a record early in the year, \"The Banana Splits\" theme song \"The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)\", which managed a number 96 peak on the \"Billboard\" Top 100 and number 94 on the RPM charts.\nRobin Carmody of \"Freaky Trigger\" writes that British bubblegum from 1968 to 1972 was distinct from the \"more worldly and sophisticated American equivalent\" by being \"simplistic, childish, over-excited, innocent, full of absolute certainties and safe knowledges\", while noting that it \"essentially bridged the gap between the poppier end of the mid-60s beat boom and glam rock\".\n1970s hits and influence.\nMost bubblegum acts were one hit wonders (notable exceptions included the Partridge Family and Tommy Roe) and the genre remained a significant commercial force until the early 1970s. Bubblegum failed to maintain its chart presence after the early 1970s due in part to changing trends in the industry. Producers such as Kasenetz and Katz subsequently pursued different musical avenues. Writing in \"Bubblegum Music Is the Naked Truth\", Chuck Eddy offered that bubblegum evolved to be \"more an attitude than a genre\" during the 1970s. In the UK, bubblegum caught on in the early 1970s and fell out of popular favor by the end of the decade. In 2010, author and musician Bob Stanley summarized: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;While some more confrontational music would become popular with kids \u2013 some of the more colourful rave anthems, for example \u2013 kids' music became synonymous with novelty tie-ins like Bob the Builder and Mr Blobby until the explosion in kids' music, fuelled by the cross-promotional opportunities offered by the multiplicity of kids' TV channels, led by the Wiggles and the Disney stable.\nMany musicians who grew up with the genre later incorporated bubblegum influences in their work. Although it is rarely acknowledged by music critics, who typically dismissed the genre, bubblegum's simple song structures, upbeat tempos, and catchy hooks were carried into punk rock. The Ramones were the most prominent of the bubblegum-influenced punk bands, adopting cartoon personae and later covering two bubblegum standards \"Little Bit O' Soul\" and \"Indian Giver\". Pitzonka stated of bubblegum's legacy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Bubblegum really did lay a deeper foundation than anybody's willing to give it credit for. Yes, it is responsible for Take That and New Kids On The Block, but it's also responsible for The Ramones. A lot of the melodic metal comes out of that too. Bubblegum was based in melody; it was all about the song. It was all about getting the message across in two and a half minutes. [...] And it was the perfect antidote to everything that was going on [in the late 1960s].\nBubblegum dance.\nThe term \"bubblegum dance\" has sometimes been used to describe music. The 1971 Osmonds song \"One Bad Apple\" is a prototypical example, modeled after the style of the Jackson 5. Another example is Danish-based Eurodance being labeled as such, most notably \"Barbie Girl\" from Aqua.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The resource of the shared country code consists of a \"country code\" and a \"group identification code\" (CC + GIC) and provides the capability for a group of countries to provide telecommunication services within the group. The Secretariat of the ITU Standardization Sector (ITU-T), the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) is responsible for the assignment of the CC + GIC.\nNumbering formats.\nThe E.164 recommendation provides the telephone number structure and functionality for five categories of telephone numbers used in international public telecommunications.\nFor each of the categories, it details the components of the numbering structure and the digit analysis required for successful routing of calls. Annex A provides additional information on the structure and function of E.164 numbers. Annex B provides information on network identification, service parameters, calling/connected line identity, dialing procedures, and addressing for Geographic-based ISDN calls. Specific E.164-based applications which differ in usage are defined in separate recommendations.\nThe number categories are all based on a fifteen-digit numbering space. Before 1997, only twelve digits were allowed. The definition does not include any international call prefixes, necessary for a call to reach international circuits from inside the country of call origination.\nGlobal services.\n Figure 2\nUses of E.164 numbers.\nE.164 numbers were originally defined for use in the worldwide public switched telephone network (PSTN). The early PSTN collected routing digits from users (e.g. on a dial pad), signaled those digits to each telephony switch, and used the numbers to determine how to ultimately reach the called party.\nITU-T E.123 entitled \"Notation for national and international telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and web addresses\" provides guidance when printing E.164 telephone numbers. This format includes the recommendation of prefixing international telephone numbers with a plus sign (+) and using only spaces for digit grouping.\nThe presentation of a telephone number with the plus sign (+) indicates that the number should be dialed with an international calling prefix, in place of the plus sign. The number is presented starting with the telephone country code. This is called the \"globalized\" format of an E.164 number, and is defined in the Internet Engineering Task Force . The international calling prefix is a trunk code to reach an international circuit in the country of call origination.\nDNS Mapping of E.164 numbers.\nSome national telephone administrations and telephone companies have implemented an Internet-based database for their numbering spaces. E.164 numbers may be registered in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet in which the second-level domain e164.arpa has been reserved for telephone number mapping (ENUM). In the system, any telephone number may be mapped into a domain name using a reverse sequence of subdomains for each digit. For example, the telephone number translates to the domain name 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.9.9.9.1.e164.arpa. When a number is mapped, a DNS query may be used to locate the service facilities on the Internet that accept and process telephone calls to the owner of record of the number, using, for example, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), a call-signaling VoIP protocol whose SIP addresses are similar in format (user@domain...) to e-mail addresses. This allows a direct, end-to-end Internet connection without passing through the public switched telephone network.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is of English, Welsh, Scottish, and Icelandic descent. Gosling attended William Aberhart High School. While in high school, he wrote some of the software to analyze data from the ISIS 2 satellite, working for the University of Calgary physics department. He received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Calgary and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University, all in computer science. He wrote a version of Emacs called Gosling Emacs (Gosmacs) while working toward his doctorate. He built a multi-processor version of Unix for a 16-way computer system while at Carnegie Mellon University, before joining Sun Microsystems.\nCareer and contributions.\nGosling joined Sun Microsystems in 1984, where he worked for the next 26 years. At Sun he invented an early Unix windowing system called NeWS, which became a lesser-used alternative to the still used X Window System, because Sun did not give it an open source license.\nHe is known as the father of the Java programming language. He got the idea for the Java VM while writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating Perq Q-Code to VAX assembler and emulating the hardware. He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in 1994.\nHe created the original design of Java and implemented the language's original compiler and virtual machine. Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate student days, when he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab's DEC VAX computer, so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal. In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine.\nAnother contribution of Gosling's was co-writing the \"bundle\" program, known as \"shar\", a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike's book \"The Unix Programming Environment\".\nHe left Sun Microsystems on April 2, 2010, after it was acquired by the Oracle Corporation, citing reductions in pay, status, and decision-making ability, along with change of role and ethical challenges. He has since taken a very critical stance towards Oracle in interviews, noting that \"during the integration meetings between Sun and Oracle, where we were being grilled about the patent situation between Sun and Google, we could see the Oracle lawyer's eyes sparkle.\" He clarified his position during the \"Oracle v. Google\" trial over Android: \"While I have differences with Oracle, in this case they are in the right. Google totally slimed Sun. We were all really disturbed, even Jonathan [Schwartz]: he just decided to put on a happy face and tried to turn lemons into lemonade, which annoyed a lot of folks at Sun.\" However, he approved of the court's ruling that APIs should not be copyrightable.\nIn March 2011, Gosling joined Google. Six months later, he followed his colleague Bill Vass and joined a startup called Liquid Robotics. In late 2016, Liquid Robotics was acquired by Boeing. Following the acquisition, Gosling left Liquid Robotics to work at Amazon Web Services as Distinguished Engineer in May 2017. He retired in July 2024.\nHe has worked as an advisor at the Scala company Lightbend, Independent Director at Jelastic, and Strategic Advisor for Eucalyptus, and is a board member of DIRTT Environmental Solutions.\nAwards.\nFor his achievement, the National Academy of Engineering in the United States elected him as a Foreign Associate member. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He developed several computer operating systems, namely Microsoft Windows NT, and Digital Equipment Corporation's RSX-11M, VAXELN, VMS, and MICA.\nPersonal history.\nCutler was born in Lansing, Michigan and grew up in DeWitt, Michigan. After graduating from Olivet College, Michigan, in 1965, he went to work for DuPont.\nCutler holds at least 20 patents, and is affiliate faculty in the Computer Science Department at the University of Washington.\nCutler is an avid auto racing driver. He competed in the Atlantic Championship from 1996 to 2002, scoring a career best of 8th on the Milwaukee Mile in 2000.\nCutler was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1994 for the design and engineering of commercially successful operating systems.\nCutler is a member of Adelphic Alpha Pi Fraternity at Olivet College, Michigan.\nDuPont (1965 to 1971).\nCutler's first exposure to computers came when he was tasked to perform a computer simulations model for one of DuPont's customers using IBM's GPSS-3 language on an IBM model 7044. This work led to an interest in how computers and their operating systems worked.\nDigital Equipment Corporation (1971 to 1988).\nCutler left DuPont to pursue his interest in computer systems, beginning with Digital Equipment Corporation in 1971. He worked at Digital's headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts.\nRSX-11M.\nRSX-11M is a version of RSX-11, adapted from RSX-11D, that was made to have a smaller memory footprint. Dave Cutler was the leader of the RSX-11M project.\nVMS.\nIn April 1975, DEC began a hardware project, code-named Star, to design a 32-bit virtual address extension to its PDP-11. In June 1975, Cutler, together with Dick Hustvedt and Peter Lipman, were appointed the technical project leaders for the software project, code-named Starlet, to develop a totally new operating system for the Star family of processors. These two projects were tightly integrated from the beginning.\nThe three technical leaders of the Starlet project together with three technical leaders of the Star project formed the \"Blue Ribbon Committee\" at DEC that produced the fifth design evolution for the programs. The design featured simplifications to the memory management and process scheduling schemes of the earlier proposals and the architecture was accepted. The Star and Starlet projects culminated in the development of the VAX-11/780 superminicomputer and the VAX/VMS operating system, respectively.\nPRISM and MICA projects.\nDEC began working on a new CPU using reduced instruction set computer (RISC) design principles in 1986. Cutler, who was working in DEC's DECwest facility in Bellevue, Washington, was selected to head PRISM, a project to develop the company's RISC machine. Its operating system, code named MICA, was to embody the next generation of design principles and have a compatibility layer for Unix and VMS. The RISC machine was to be based on emitter-coupled logic (ECL) technology, and was one of three ECL projects DEC was undertaking at the time.\nFunding the research and development of multiple ECL projects yielding products that would ultimately compete against each other was a strain. Of the three ECL projects, the VAX 9000 was the only one that was directly commercialized. Primarily because of the early successes of the PMAX advanced development project and the need for differing business models, PRISM was canceled in 1988 in favor of PMAX.\nPRISM later surfaced as the basis of DEC's Alpha family of computer systems.\nAttitude towards Unix.\nCutler is known for his disdain for Unix. Said one team member who worked with Cutler:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnix is like Cutler's lifelong foe. It's like his Moriarty. He thinks Unix is a junk operating program designed by a committee of PhDs. There's never been one mind behind the whole thing, and it shows. So he's always been out to get Unix. \nMicrosoft (1988 \u2013 present).\nMicrosoft Windows NT.\nCutler left DEC for Microsoft in October 1988 and led the development of Windows NT. Later, he worked on targeting Windows NT to DEC's 64-bit Alpha architecture then on Windows 2000. After the demise of Windows on Alpha (and the demise of DEC), he was instrumental in porting Windows to AMD's new 64-bit AMD64 architecture. He was involved with the Windows XP Pro x64 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 x64 releases. He moved to working on Microsoft's Live Platform in August 2006. Cutler was awarded the prestigious status of Senior Technical Fellow at Microsoft.\nMicrosoft Windows Azure.\nAt the 2008 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft announced Azure Services Platform, a cloud-based operating system which Microsoft is developing. During the conference keynote, Cutler was mentioned as a lead developer on the project, along with Amitabh Srivastava.\nMicrosoft Xbox.\nIn January 2012, a spokesperson for Microsoft confirmed that Cutler was no longer working on Windows Azure, and had joined the Xbox team. In May 2013, Microsoft announced the Xbox One console, and Cutler was mentioned as having worked in developing the host OS of the new gaming device. Apparently his work was focused on creating an optimized version of Microsoft's Hyper-V Host OS specifically designed for Xbox One.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Applications include surveys for marine archaeology, shipwreck hunting, search and recovery (SAR), and environmental monitoring. In conjunction with seafloor samples, it is able to provide an understanding of the differences in material and texture type of the seabed. Side-scan sonar imagery is also a commonly used tool to detect debris items and other obstructions on the seafloor that may be hazardous to shipping or to seafloor installations by the oil and gas industry. In addition, the status of pipelines and cables on the seafloor can be investigated using side-scan sonar. Side-scan data are frequently acquired along with bathymetric soundings and sub-bottom profiler data, thus providing a glimpse of the shallow structure of the seabed. Side-scan sonar is also used for fisheries research, dredging operations and environmental studies. It also has military applications including mine detection.\nHow it works.\nSide-scan uses a sonar device that emits conical or fan-shaped pulses down toward the seafloor across a wide angle perpendicular to the path of the sensor through the water, which may be towed from a surface vessel or submarine (called a \u201ctowfish\u201d), or mounted on the ship's hull. The intensity of the acoustic reflections from the seafloor of this fan-shaped beam is recorded in a series of cross-track slices. When stitched together along the direction of motion, these slices form an image of the sea bottom within the swath (coverage width) of the beam. The sound frequencies used in side-scan sonar usually range from 100 to 500 kHz; higher frequencies yield better resolution but less range.\nHistory.\nTechnology.\nThe earliest side-scan sonars used a single conical-beam transducer. Next, units were made with two transducers to cover both sides. The transducers were either contained in one hull-mounted package or with two packages on either side of the vessel. Next the transducers evolved to fan-shaped beams to produce a better \"sonogram\" or sonar image. In order to get closer to the bottom in deep water the side-scan transducers were placed in a \"tow fish\" and pulled by a tow cable.\nUp until the mid-1980s, commercial side scan images were produced on paper records. The early paper records were produced with a sweeping plotter that burned the image into a scrolling paper record. Later plotters allowed for the simultaneous plotting of position and ship motion information onto the paper record. In the late 1980s, commercial systems using the newer, cheaper computer systems developed digital scan-converters that could mimic more cheaply the analog scan converters used by the military systems to produce TV and computer displayed images of the scan, and store them on video tape. Currently data is stored on computer hard drives or solid-state media - the data is typically displayed in grayscale or color images, known as side scan sonograms, which provide a visual representation of the underwater environment. \nMilitary application.\nOne of the inventors of side-scan sonar was German scientist, Dr. Julius Hagemann, who was brought to the US after World War II and worked at the US Navy Mine Defense Laboratory, Panama City, FL from 1947 until his death in 1964. His work is documented in US Patent 4,197,591 which was first disclosed in Aug 1958, but remained classified by the US Navy until it was finally issued in 1980. Experimental side-scan sonar systems were made during the 1950s in laboratories including Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Hudson Laboratories and by Dr. Harold Edgerton at MIT.\nMilitary side-scan sonars were made in the 1950s by Westinghouse. Advanced systems were later developed and built for special military purposes, such as to find H-Bombs lost at sea or to find a lost Russian submarine, at the Westinghouse facility in Annapolis up through the 1990s. This group also produced the first and only working \"Angle Look Sonar\" that could trace objects while looking under the vehicle.\nCommercial application.\nThe first commercial side-scan system was the Kelvin Hughes \"Transit Sonar\", a converted echo-sounder with a single-channel, pole-mounted, fan-beam transducer introduced around 1960. In 1963 Dr. Harold Edgerton, Edward Curley, and John Yules used a conical-beam 12\u00a0kHz side-scan sonar to find the sunken Vineyard Lightship in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. A team led by Martin Klein at Edgerton, Germeshausen &amp; Grier (later E.G. &amp; G., Inc.) developed the first successful towed, dual-channel commercial side-scan sonar system from 1963 to 1966. Martin Klein is generally considered to be the \"father\" of commercial side-scan sonar. In 1967, Edgerton used Klein's sonar to help Alexander McKee find Henry VIII's flagship \"Mary Rose\". That same year Klein used the sonar to help archaeologist George Bass find a 2000-year-old ship off the coast of Turkey. In 1968 Klein founded Klein Associates (now KLEIN - A MIND Technology Business) and continued to work on improvements including the first commercial high frequency (500\u00a0kHz) systems and the first dual-frequency side-scan sonars, and the first combined side-scan and sub-bottom profiling sonar. In 1985, Charles Mazel of Klein Associates (now Klein Marine Systems, Inc.) produced the first commercial side-scan sonar training videos and the first \"Side Scan Sonar Training Manual\" and two oceanographers found the wreck of the RMS \"Titanic\".\nFor surveying large areas, the GLORIA sidescan sonar was developed by Marconi Underwater Systems and the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences (IOS) for NERC. GLORIA stands for Geological Long Range Inclined Asdic. It was used by the US Geological Survey and the IOS in the UK to obtain images of continental shelves worldwide. It operated at relatively low frequencies to obtain long range. Like most side-scan sonars, the GLORIA instrument is towed behind a ship. GLORIA has a ping rate of two per minute, and detects returns from a range of up to 22\u00a0km either side of the sonar fish.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As with all other branches of archaeology, it evolved from its roots in pre-history and in the classical era to include sites from the historical and industrial eras. \nIts acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites, and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers. As a result, underwater archaeology initially struggled to establish itself as actual archaeological research. This changed when universities began teaching the subject and a theoretical and practical base for the sub-discipline was firmly established in the late 1980s. \nUnderwater archaeology now has a number of branches including, maritime archaeology: the scientifically based study of past human life, behaviors and cultures and their activities in, on, around and (lately) under the sea, estuaries and rivers. This is most often effected using the physical remains found in, around or under salt or fresh water or buried beneath water-logged sediment. In recent years, the study of submerged WWII sites and of submerged aircraft in the form of underwater aviation archaeology have also emerged as bona fide activity.\nThough often mistaken as such, underwater archaeology is not restricted to the study of shipwrecks. Changes in sea level because of local seismic events such as the earthquakes that devastated Port Royal and Alexandria or more widespread climatic changes on a continental scale mean that some sites of human occupation that were once on dry land are now submerged. At the end of the last ice age, the North Sea was a great plain, and anthropological material, as well as the remains of animals such as mammoths, are sometimes recovered by trawlers. Also, because human societies have always made use of water, sometimes the remains of structures that these societies built underwater still exist (such as the foundations of crannogs, bridges and harbors) when traces on dry land have been lost. As a result, underwater archaeological sites cover a vast range including: submerged indigenous sites and places where people once lived or visited that have been subsequently covered by water due to rising sea levels; wells, cenotes, wrecks (shipwrecks; aircraft); the remains of structures created in water (such as crannogs, bridges or harbors); other port-related structures; refuse or debris sites where people disposed of their waste, garbage and other items, such as ships, aircraft, munitions and machinery, by dumping into the water.\nUnderwater archaeology is often complementary to archaeological research on terrestrial sites because the two are often linked by many and various elements including geographic, social, political, economic and other considerations. As a result, a study of an archaeological landscape can involve a multidisciplinary approach requiring the inclusion of many specialists from a variety of disciplines including prehistory, historical archaeology, maritime archaeology, and anthropology. There are many examples. One is the wreck of the VOC ship \"Zuytdorp\" lost in 1711 on the coast of Western Australia, where there remains considerable speculation that some of the crew survived and, after establishing themselves on shore, intermixed with indigenous tribes from the area. The archaeological signature at this site also now extends into the interaction between indigenous people and the European pastoralists who entered the area in the mid-19th century.\nResearch potential.\nThere are many reasons why underwater archaeology can make a significant contribution to our knowledge of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the \"Titanic\") or circumstances of loss (\"Housatonic\" was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as \"Mary Rose\" can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.\nSometimes it is not the wrecking of the ship that is important, but the fact that we have access to the remains of it, especially where the vessel was of major importance and significance in the history of science and engineering (or warfare), due to being the first of its type of vessel. The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the \"Hunley\", which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (\"Hunley\" also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels and was one of the few historic warships ever raised intact); the \"Resurgam\" \"II\", the first powered submarine; and \"Holland 5\", which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.\nUNESCO Convention.\nAll traces of human existence underwater which are one hundred years old or more are protected by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This convention aims at preventing the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information and looting. It helps states parties to protect their underwater cultural heritage with an international legal framework.\nOn the basis of the recommendations defined in the above-mentioned UNESCO Convention various European projects have been funded such as the CoMAS project\nfor in situ conservation planning of underwater archaeological artefacts.*\nChallenges.\nUnderwater sites are inevitably difficult to access, and more hazardous, compared with working on dry land. In order to access the site directly, diving equipment and diving skills are necessary. The depths that can be accessed by divers, and the length of time available at depths, are limited. For deep sites beyond the reach of divers, submersibles or remote sensing equipment are needed.\nFor a marine site, while some form of working platform (typically a boat or ship) is often needed, shore-based activities are common. Notwithstanding, underwater archaeology is a field plagued by logistics problems. A working platform for underwater archaeology needs to be equipped to provide for the delivery of air for example, recompression and medical facilities, or specialist remote sensing equipment, analysis of archaeological results, support for activities being undertaken in the water, storage of supplies, facilities for conservation for any items recovered from the water, as well as accommodation for workers. Equipment used for archaeological investigation, including water dredge and airlifts create additional hazards and logistics issues. Moreover, marine sites may be subject to strong tidal flows or poor weather which mean that the site is only accessible for a limited amount of time. Some marine creatures also pose a threat to diver safety.\nUnderwater sites are often dynamic, that is they are subject to movement by currents, surf, storm damage or tidal flows. Structures may be unexpectedly uncovered, or buried beneath sediments. Over time, exposed structures will be eroded, broken up and scattered. The dynamic nature of the environment may make in-situ conservation infeasible, especially as exposed organics, such as the wood of a shipwreck, are likely to be consumed by marine organisms such as piddocks. In addition, underwater sites can be chemically active, with the result that iron can be leached from metal structures to form concretions. The original metal will then be left in a fragile state. Artifacts recovered from underwater sites need special care.\nVisibility may be poor, because of sediments or algae in the water and lack of light penetration. This means that survey techniques that work well on land (such as triangulation), generally can not be used effectively under water.\nIn addition it can be difficult to allow access to the results of the archaeological research as underwater sites do not provide good outreach possibilities or access for the general public. Work has been done to bridge this difficulty through the use of the World Wide Web for webcasting projects, or dedicated virtual reality systems that allow users to perform a virtual diving into an interactive 3D reconstruction of the underwater archaeological site. An example is the excavation of the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" and the \"QAR DiveLive\" program, a live interactive virtual field trip to the wrecksite.\nTechniques.\nAlthough specialized techniques and tools have been developed to address the challenges of working under water, the archaeological goals and process are essentially the same as in any other context. Investigating an underwater site however, is likely to take longer and be more costly than an equivalent terrestrial one.\nAn important aspect of project design is likely to be managing the logistics of operating from a boat and of managing diving operations. The depth of water over the site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale. Many of the most carefully investigated sites, including the \"Mary Rose\" have relied substantially on avocational archaeologists working over a considerable period of time.\nAs with archaeology on land, some techniques are essentially manual, using simple equipment (generally relying on the efforts of one or more scuba divers), while others use advanced technology and more complex logistics (for example requiring a large support vessel, with equipment handling cranes, underwater communication and computer visualization).\nPosition fixing.\nKnowing the location of an archaeological site is fundamental to being able to study it. In the open sea there are no landmarks, so position fixing is generally achieved using GPS. Historically, sites within sight of the shore would have been located using transects. A site may also be located by visually surveying some form of marker (such as a buoy) from two known (mapped) points on land. The depth of water at a site can be determined from charts or by using the depth sounding sonar equipment that is standard equipment on ships. Such sonar can often be used to locate an upstanding structure, such as a shipwreck, once GPS has placed the research vessel in approximately the right location.\nSite survey.\nThe type of survey required depends on the information that is needed to resolve archaeological questions, but most sites will need at least some form of topographical survey and a site plan showing the locations of artifacts and other archaeological material, where samples were taken and where different types of archaeological investigation were carried out. Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (water chemistry, dynamic properties) as well as the natural organisms present on the site are recorded. For shipwrecks, particularly post-industrial age shipwrecks, pollution threats from wreck material may need to be investigated and recorded.\nThe simplest approach to survey is to carry out three-dimensional surveying by divers using depth gauges and tape measurements. Research shows that such measurements are typically less accurate than similar surveys on land. Where it is not practical or safe for divers to physically visit a site, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) enable observation and intervention with control by personnel located at the surface. The low technology approach of measuring using tape measures and depth gauges can be replaced with a more accurate and quicker high technology approach using acoustic positioning. ROV technology was used during the \"Mardi Gras\" Shipwreck Project. The \"Mardi Gras Shipwreck\" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico in of water.\nRemote sensing or Marine Geophysics is generally carried out using equipment towed from a vessel on the surface and therefore does not require any one, or any equipment to actually penetrate to the full depth of the site. Sensitive sonar, especially side-scan sonar or multi-beam sonar may be used to image an underwater site. Magnetometry can be used to locate metal remains such as metal shipwrecks, anchors and cannon. Sub-bottom profiling utilizes sonar to detect structures buried beneath sediment.\nRecording.\nA variety of techniques are available to divers to record findings underwater. Scale drawing is the basic tool of archaeology and can be undertaken underwater. Pencils will write underwater on permatrace, plastic dive slates, or matt laminated paper.\nPhotography and videography are the mainstays of recording, which has become much more convenient with the advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. Cameras, including video cameras can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for underwater videography. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single photomontage or photomosaic image of the whole site. 3D photogrammetry has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.\nExcavation.\nWhere intrusive underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can be removed from an area of investigation using a water dredge or airlift. When used correctly, these devices have an additional benefit in tending to improve the visibility in the immediate vicinity of the investigation. For very deep sea excavation manned and unmanned submersibles are sometimes used to view sites. Underwater photography and sonar imaging can also be conducted from these platforms which assists the recording process.\nArchaeological science.\nA variety of archaeological sciences are used in underwater archaeology. Dendrochronology is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships. It may also provide additional information, including the area where the timber was harvested (i.e. likely to be where the ship was built) and whether or not there are later repairs or reuse of salvaged materials. Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, archaeobotany and archaeozoology have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of pollen samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence on the nature of the landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through X-ray of concretions. Geology can provide insight into how the site evolved, including changes in sea-level, erosion by rivers and deposition by rivers or in the sea.\nArtifact recovery and conservation.\nArtifacts recovered from underwater sites need stabilization to manage the process of removal of water and conservation. The artifact either needs to be dried carefully, or the water replaced with some inert medium (as in the case of The Mary Rose). Artifacts recovered from salt water, particularly metals and glass need be stabilized following absorption of salt or leaching of metals. In-situ conservation of underwater structures is possible, but consideration needs to be given to the dynamic nature of the site. Changes to the site during intrusive investigation or removal of artifacts may result in scouring which exposes the site to further deterioration.\nInterpretation and presentation of underwater archaeology.\nDiver trails also called wreck trails can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-diving One excellent example is the Florida Public Archaeology Network's (FPAN) \"Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail.\" The Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail features 12 shipwrecks including artificial reefs and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, Florida. Otherwise presentation will typically rely on publication (book or journal articles, web-sites and electronic media such as CD-ROM). Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The \"Mardi Gras\" Shipwreck Project integrated a one-hour HD documentary, short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live underwater video of the \"Queen Anne's Revenge\" Shipwreck Project was webcast to the Internet as a part of the \"QAR DiveLive\" educational program that reached thousands of children around the world. Created and co-produced by Nautilus Productions and Marine Grafics, this project enabled students to talk to scientists and learn about methods and technologies utilized by the underwater archaeology team.\nEnvironmental impact.\nUnderwater archeology can have many impacts on the environment such as destroying habitats and disrupting wildlife that may be in the area of the archeological site. \nPublications.\nPublication is an essential part of the archaeological process and is particularly crucial for underwater archaeology, where sites are generally not accessible and it is often the case that sites are not preserved in-situ.\nThe specialist journals on maritime archaeology, which include the long established \"International Journal of Nautical Archaeology\", \"The Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology\" (AIMA) and the recently launched \"Journal of Maritime Archaeology\" publish articles about maritime archaeological research and underwater archaeology. However, research on underwater sites can also be published in mainstream archaeological journals, or thematic archaeological journals. Some institutions also make their unpublished reports, often called 'Grey Literature', accessible thereby allowing access to far more detail and a wider range of archaeological data than is otherwise the case with books and journals. An example is the works of the Department of Maritime Archaeology at the Western Australian Museum.\nThe public interest market is covered by a number of diving, shipwreck and underwater archaeology books, beginning with the works of Jacques Cousteau.\nThe techniques of underwater archaeology are also documented in published works, including a number of handbooks, and Muckelroy's classic work on Maritime Archaeology.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for playing quirky, charismatic women since the late 1980s, Ryan is particularly recognized for her leading roles in romantic comedies, a genre she dominated during the 1980s and 1990s. Dubbed \"America's Sweetheart\" by the media, she became one of Hollywood's most bankable stars of the latter decade.\nShe made her acting debut in 1981 in the drama film \"Rich and Famous\". She joined the cast of the CBS soap opera \"As the World Turns\" in 1982. In the 1980s, Ryan appeared in \"Top Gun\" (1986), \"Promised Land\" (1987), and the Rob Reiner-directed romantic comedy \"When Harry Met Sally...\" (1989), for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination.\nA prolific actress through the 1990s and 2000s, Ryan starred in \"Joe Versus the Volcano\" (1990), \"The Doors\" (1991), \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993), \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" (1994), \"French Kiss\" (1995), \"Courage Under Fire\" (1996)\", Anastasia\" (1997), \"Addicted to Love\" (1997), \"You've Got Mail\" (1998), \"City of Angels\" (1998), \"Proof of Life\" (2000), \"Kate &amp; Leopold\" (2001), and \"The Women\" (2008). In 2015, she made her directorial debut with \"Ithaca,\" in which she also starred. After an eight-year hiatus, Ryan returned to the screen in the romantic comedy \"What Happens Later\" (2023), which she also directed.\nEarly life.\nRyan was born and raised in Fairfield, Connecticut, to Susan Jordan (\"n\u00e9e\" Duggan), a former actress and English teacher, and Harry Hyra, a math teacher. Her father is of Polish descent. She was raised Catholic and attended St. Pius X Elementary School in Fairfield. She had two sisters, Dana (d.\u20092022) and Annie (d.\u20092019), and has one brother, musician Andrew Hyra, a member of the band Billy Pilgrim. Her parents divorced in 1976 when she was 15.\nRyan graduated from Bethel High School in 1979. She studied journalism as an undergraduate, first at the University of Connecticut and then at New York University. During college, she acted in television commercials and the soap opera \"As the World Turns\" to earn extra money. Her success as an actress led her to leave college a semester before she planned to graduate. When she joined the Screen Actors Guild, she used the surname \"Ryan\", her maternal grandmother's maiden name.\nCareer.\nEarly work.\nAfter her film debut in director George Cukor's final film, \"Rich and Famous\", in 1981, Ryan played Betsy Stewart in the daytime drama \"As the World Turns\" from 1982 to 1984; her character was featured in a popular romantic story arc.\nShe also appeared in some television commercials during the early 1980s for Burger King and Aim toothpaste, among others. Several television and smaller film roles followed, including appearances in \"Charles in Charge\", \"Armed and Dangerous\", and \"Amityville 3-D\". Her role in \"Promised Land\" (1987) earned Ryan her first Independent Spirit Award nomination.\nIn 1986, she played Carole Bradshaw, the wife of Anthony Edwards' character, naval flight officer Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw, in \"Top Gun\". Scenes with them were reprised in the 2022 sequel \"\" as flashbacks to illustrate the emotional conflicts between lead character Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) and the Bradshaws' grown son, Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller).\nRyan appeared in the film \"Innerspace\" in 1987 with her future husband Dennis Quaid, and they subsequently costarred in the remake of \"D.O.A.\" (1988) and \"Flesh and Bone\" (1993). She also costarred in 1988 with Sean Connery and Mark Harmon in \"The Presidio\".\n1989\u20131999: Career breakthrough and stardom.\nRyan's first leading role was the romantic comedy \"When Harry Met Sally...\" (1989), which paired her with comic actor Billy Crystal and earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. Her portrayal of Sally Albright includes an oft-recounted scene in which her character, lunching with Crystal's character in Katz's Delicatessen in Manhattan, theatrically demonstrates for him how easy it is for a woman to fake an orgasm.\nRyan next appeared in Oliver Stone's moderately successful film \"The Doors\", and in \"Prelude to a Kiss\", which flopped. In 1993, the hugely successful romantic comedy \"Sleepless in Seattle\" paired Ryan for a second time with Tom Hanks. They had previously been the romantic leads, with Ryan playing three different women, in John Patrick Shanley's \"Joe Versus the Volcano\" in 1990 \u2014 a commercial disappointment which later developed a cult following. (Hanks and Ryan were once again paired in another box-office success, \"You've Got Mail\", in 1998.) She earned her second nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance in \"Sleepless in Seattle\". She was offered the role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, the protagonist of \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991), but rejected it due to the film's gruesome and violent themes.\nIn 1994, Ryan played an alcoholic high-school guidance counselor \u2013 far from the romantic-comedy ingenue roles for which she had become famous \u2013 in Luis Mandoki's social romantic drama \"When a Man Loves a Woman\", also starring Andy Garcia. The film and her performance were both well received by critics. A critic for \"Variety\" called the film \"a first-class production, accentuated by fine performances and an unflinching script,\" and another praised Ryan for her \"roller-coaster role\". The film was a notable success, grossing $50\u00a0million in the United States alone, and garnered Ryan a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. The same year, Ryan returned to type, starring alongside Tim Robbins in Fred Schepisi's romantic comedy \"I.Q.\" The film centers on a mechanic and a Princeton doctoral candidate who fall in love, with the aid of the graduate student's uncle, Albert Einstein (played by Walter Matthau). Ryan later won Harvard's Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year award, and \"People Magazine\" dubbed her one of \"the 50 most beautiful people in the world\".\nIn 1995, critic Richard Corliss called Ryan \"the current soul of romantic comedy\". The same year she also starred opposite Kevin Kline in Lawrence Kasdan's \"French Kiss\", a comedy catering to her \"America's Sweetheart\" image, and was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award \u2013 given to \"outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.\"\nIn 1996, Ryan starred as a helicopter pilot in the war drama \"Courage Under Fire\", a critical and commercial success. The following year, she voiced the lead role in the animated film \"Anastasia\", which met with good reviews and box office success, and she and Matthew Broderick played a pair of jilted lovers bent on revenge in the black comedy \"Addicted to Love\", giving Ryan a female lead at least superficially different from her usual roles.\nIn 1998, she starred in two films. \"City of Angels\" (an American remake of Wim Wenders' \"Wings of Desire\") drew positive reviews and earned nearly $200\u00a0million worldwide. \"You've Got Mail\", reteaming Ryan with Hanks, earned her a third nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical and made more than $250\u00a0million worldwide. She also appeared in 1998's \"Hurlyburly\" with Sean Penn.\n2000\u20132006: Continued roles.\nRyan's first film of the 2000s was \"Hanging Up\", a Diane Keaton-directed family comedy-drama about a trio of sisters who bond over the approaching death of their curmudgeonly father. Also starring Keaton, Lisa Kudrow and Walter Matthau, the film adaptation of Delia Ephron's 1995 novel received poor reviews from critics.\nThe same year, Ryan was cast in the action thriller \"Proof of Life\" with Russell Crowe, directed by Taylor Hackford. In the film, she portrayed the distraught wife of a kidnapped engineer, played by David Morse, while relying on a resourceful troubleshooter who makes a profession of dealing with international bandits. While the film became a lukewarm critical and commercial success, grossing $63\u00a0million worldwide, it garnered much reportage in the tabloid press in association with Ryan and Crowe's affair. Stephen Holden, film critic for \"The New York Times,\" did not think the film worked well and opined that the actors did not connect.\nA year later, she once again returned to her romantic comedy roots with \"Kate &amp; Leopold\" (2001), alongside Hugh Jackman. A film about a British Duke who travels through time from New York in 1876 to the present and falls in love with a successful market researcher in the modern New York, the James Mangold-directed film received a mixed-to-positive response, with Lael Loewenstein of \"Variety\" summing it as \"a mostly charming and diverting tale\". At a total gross of $70\u00a0million, it would be Ryan's highest-grossing film of the decade.\nIn 2003, Ryan broke away from her usual roles, starring alongside Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Jason Leigh in Jane Campion's erotic thriller film \"In the Cut\". Co-producer Nicole Kidman had originally been cast in the lead, but the actress eventually dropped out after five years of development, leaving the role to Ryan, who appeared nude in a lengthy and rather graphic love scene for the first time in her career. Although her image-conflicting depiction earned Ryan and the film much media attention, the film failed with critics and grossed only $23\u00a0million in theaters. While promoting \"In the Cut\" on Michael Parkinson's talk show \"Parkinson\", the actress was offended by the host's questions regarding filming nude scenes, appearing disinterested, delivering one-word responses, and suggesting that Parkinson end their interview when asked what she would do in his position. The interaction is considered to be one of the most infamous in talk show history. Three years after the interview aired, Ryan explained that she felt Parkinson was berating her for performing nudity and had attempted to disagree with his views respectfully. Parkinson eventually apologized for losing his temper in 2021, but maintained that Ryan's behavior \"played a part in it too\". \nShe continued the strategy of acting against type with a leading role in Charles S. Dutton's directorial debut \"Against the Ropes\" (2004), a fictionalized sport drama about American boxing manager Jackie Kallen, the first woman to become a success in the sport. The film grossed less than $6\u00a0million in the U.S. and was panned by critics, in part because of its resemblance to other boxing films, such as the \"Rocky\" series.\n2007\u20132009: Independent films.\nFollowing a three-year hiatus, Ryan returned to film with Jon Kasdan's 2007 independent film \"In the Land of Women\". Starring alongside Kristen Stewart and Olympia Dukakis, she played Sarah Hardwicke, a mother and wife facing breast cancer, who connects with her neighbor's much younger grandson, played by Adam Brody. Released to mixed reviews by critics, the film grossed $17.5\u00a0million worldwide, exceeding its budget of $10\u00a0million. Ryan received a positive response for her performance, with Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" noting it \"the best work [she] has done in forever\".\nRyan's first film release of 2008 was \"The Deal\", a satirical comedy film based on Peter Lefcourt's 1991 novel of the same title about Hollywood. Directed by Steven Schachter and co-starring William H. Macy, the film was shot in Cape Town and other South African locations and celebrated its world premiere at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Garnering generally mixed to negative reviews, it failed to draw interest among film studios, resulting in a straight-to-DVD release in January 2009. In his review for \"Variety\", Peter Debruge said, \"The characters seem to be doing all the laughing, while the general public has nothing to cling to but the horndog flirtation between mismatched leads William H. Macy and Meg Ryan\u2014hardly ideal ingredients for mainstream success.\" Ryan also starred in George Gallo's \"My Mom's New Boyfriend\", shot in 2006 but released direct-to-DVD in 2008. Co-starring Colin Hanks, Selma Blair and Antonio Banderas, the action comedy received overwhelmingly negative reviews, with David Nusair of \"Reel Film\" noting it \"an unmitigated disaster virtually from its opening frames\".\nRyan's last film of 2008 was \"The Women\", a remake of the 1939 production. The all-female cast comprises Annette Bening, Debra Messing, and Jada Pinkett Smith. Written, produced and directed by Diane English, the film centers on a group of four female Manhattan socialites whose primary interest is idle gossip, with Ryan portraying a wealthy woman whose husband is cheating on her with a shop girl, played by Eva Mendes. Ryan was the first actress to join the long-delayed production, which had struggled to find financing since the early 1990s, resulting in an independent production budgeted at $18\u00a0million. Upon its release, \"The Women\" received a disastrous response from critics, with Richard Schickel of \"Time\" calling it \"one of the worst movies I've ever seen\". The film was a financial success, however, becoming Ryan's most successful film since 2001's \"Kate &amp; Leopold\" with a worldwide gross of $50\u00a0million.\nIn 2009, Ryan starred alongside Kristen Bell and Justin Long in the independent comedy film \"Serious Moonlight\". In this film, directed by actress Cheryl Hines and based on a screenplay by late writer Adrienne Shelly, who was murdered a year prior to filming, Ryan portrayed a high-powered female attorney who learns that her husband, played by Timothy Hutton, is about to leave their troubled marriage, and decides to hold him captive by duct-taping him to a toilet. Picked up by Magnolia Pictures, the production received a limited release throughout North America only and grossed less than $150,000 worldwide. Critical reaction to the film was generally mixed-to-negative, although Ryan was praised for her \"terrific\" performance. Also in 2009, Ryan guest-starred on the seventh season of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\".\n2010\u2013present: Directing.\nRyan was attached to several productions in the early 2010s\u2014including the ensemble drama \"Lives of The Saints\" opposite Kat Dennings, Kevin Zegers, and John Lithgow, and \"Long Time Gone\", a film adaptation of the April Stevens novel \"Angel Angel\",\u2014all of which failed to materialize. In April 2011, it was announced that Ryan would make her feature film directing debut in \"Into the Beautiful\", described as \"a contemporary \"Big Chill\" with longtime friends reconnecting\", but it was never made.\nIn October 2012, Ryan was featured in the PBS documentary \"Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide\". The series introduces women and girls living under difficult circumstances and fighting to challenge them. The same month, Ryan's audiobook recording of William Saroyan's \"The Human Comedy\" was released. In October 2013, it was reported that Ryan would be returning to television to produce and star in a new comedy for NBC revolving around a former hotshot New York editor, for which it again failed to get production approval.\nFollowing another four-year hiatus, Ryan re-teamed with Lisa Kudrow on her improvisational comedy series \"Web Therapy\", for which she filmed five episodes in 2013. The following year, she provided the future voice of Greta Gerwig's character in the pilot of \"How I Met Your Dad\", a woman-centric variation of the CBS sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\" that was not picked up. CBS later passed on the project.\nRyan's next feature film was the ABC Family film \"Fan Girl\", an independent comedy about a 15-year-old girl, played by Kiernan Shipka, with a passion for filmmaking who sets out to make a movie about her favorite band, All Time Low. It premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival in June 2015.\nAlso in 2015, Ryan made her directing debut with \"Ithaca\", a drama film based on the 1943 novel \"The Human Comedy\" by William Saroyan. Filmed in Petersburg, Virginia, it starred Ryan and had its world premiere at the Middleburg Film Festival in October. Ryan returned to the screen alongside David Duchovny in the 2023 romantic comedy, \"What Happens Later\", also directed by Ryan. In May 2025, it was announced that she had been cast in Lena Dunham's upcoming romantic comedy, \"Good Sex\".\nIn 2024 Ryan attended the Sarajevo Film Festival to receive the highest award the Heart of Sarajevo. She also held a masterclass moderated by Academy Award winning Bosnian director Danis Tanovi\u0107\nPublic image and legacy.\nDuring the peak of her career, Ryan was one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, comparable to Julia Roberts. She has been called one of the greatest actresses of the 1990s. She was also one of Hollywood's highest-paid, earning as much as $15 million per film by the end of the decade. Ryan is particularly known for her work in romantic comedies, having starred in several from the late 1980s until the early 2000s. The 1990s were particularly prolific for Ryan's work in the genre, appearing in six romantic comedies during the decade. Two of her films, \"When Harry Met Sally...\"(1989) and \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993), are ranked among the 10 greatest romantic comedies of all time by the American Film Institute. The organization also ranked the same films among the 100 greatest romance films, at numbers 25 and 45 respectively. Journalist Jane Pauley, as well as Kate Erbland of IndieWire, recognized Ryan as one of the leading ladies responsible for the genre's resurgence, earning her the nickname the \"Queen of Rom-coms\". Benjamin Lee of \"The Guardian\" attributes Ryan's association with the genre to her \"endless source of warmth and charisma, boasting a magic, ineffable charm that only a handful of other actors have ever truly had\". Journalist Michael Shnayerson declared Ryan the \"queen of the screwball romantic comedy\" whose \"instinct for physical comedy puts her in a league with the greats\u2014Carole Lombard, Rosalind Russell, Jean Arthur\".\nFor much of her career, Ryan typically played cheerful, witty, and quirky women in romantic comedies, but she has also starred in thrillers, dramas, and action films. Ryan does not feel she was pigeonholed into the romantic comedy genre, explaining that they comprise a comparatively small portion of her filmography, and insists that her desire to explore different genres as an actor did not stem from any pressure to reinvent herself, but rather a genuine passion for trying new roles. Described as an embodiment of the girl next door archetype, the media dubbed Ryan \"America's sweetheart\" due to both her wholesome on and offscreen personas, a label she admitted to feeling conflicted about. Joanna Robinson of \"Vanity Fair\" felt Ryan's early roles limited both the jobs she was offered and audience perception of her. However, journalist Andrew Anthony insists Ryan was greatly responsible for the image she perpetuated, rather than a victim of it.\nSome of the actress' attempts to explore different archetypes and genres have been met with mixed results. Notably, her role in \"In the Cut\" (2003) drew backlash from critics and fans, after which she dramatically limited her workload and public appearances. \"The New Republic\"'s David Thomson said Ryan became \"widely regarded as that nice girl next door ... who lost her sweetness\" after the film. In retrospect, Ryan said they should have prepared audiences for her departure from the archetype she had become known for. According to Anthony Brett of \"The Daily Telegraph\", Ryan's infamous \"Parkinson\" interview damaged her reputation for several years. Ryan's public image also suffered from rumors that she had cheated on then-husband Dennis Quaid with \"Proof of Life\" (2000) co-star Russell Crowe. In 2019, Ryan described herself as a \"terrible celebrity\" who finds fame to be uncomfortable, exhausting and disabling.\nRyan is particularly fond of movies from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, citing actors Claudette Colbert, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Katharine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart as personal favorites and influences of hers. She claims to have never read an article written about her or her work, describing herself as too vulnerable. Ryan also became known for the shag haircut she wore during the 1990s, which was often requested by fans and nicknamed \"The Meg\" after her.\nPersonal life.\nRyan married actor Dennis Quaid on February 14, 1991. They have one child together, Jack Quaid, born April 24, 1992. She and Quaid announced their separation in June 2000, and their divorce became final in July 2001. There were allegations of infidelity on both sides, and Quaid added that Ryan's fame was a factor in the divorce. \nRyan became romantically involved with actor Russell Crowe while working on their 2000 film \"Proof of Life\", but said Quaid not being faithful ended her marriage. \"Russell didn't break up the marriage.\"\nIn January 2006, Ryan adopted a 14-month-old girl from China whom she named Daisy True. From 2010 to 2014, Ryan was in a relationship with American singer-songwriter John Mellencamp. They reunited in 2017, and Ryan announced their engagement on November 8, 2018. In October 2019, it was reported that Ryan had ended their engagement.\nPolitical views.\nRyan has publicly supported the Democratic Party, especially its environmental protection programs and initiatives. In 2003, she supported Wesley Clark's campaign for U.S. president. She later supported John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election campaign.\nAwards and nominations.\nRyan has received multiple awards and nominations throughout her career, including three Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance in the romantic comedies \"When Harry Met Sally...\" (1989), \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"You've Got Mail\" (1998).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Jones was largely responsible for the programme's innovative, surreal structure, in which sketches flowed from one to the next without the use of punch lines. He made his directorial debut with \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", which he co-directed with Gilliam, and also directed the subsequent Python films \"Life of Brian\" and \"The Meaning of Life\". His other directorial credits include \"Personal Services\" and \"The Wind in the Willows\".\nJones co-created and co-wrote with Palin the anthology series \"Ripping Yarns\". He also wrote an early draft of Jim Henson's film \"Labyrinth\" and is credited with the screenplay. Jones was a well-respected medieval historian, having written or co-written several books and presented television documentaries about the period, as well as a prolific children's author. In 2016, Jones received a Lifetime Achievement award at the BAFTA Cymru Awards for his outstanding contribution to television and film. After living for several years with a degenerative aphasia, he gradually lost the ability to speak and died in 2020 from frontotemporal dementia.\nEarly life.\nJones was born on 1 February 1942 in the seaside town of Colwyn Bay, on the north coast of Wales, the son of housewife Dilys Louisa (Newnes), and Alick George Parry-Jones, a bank clerk. When he was born during World War II, his father was serving with the Royal Air Force in Scotland. A week after he was born, his father was posted in India as a Flight Lieutenant (Temporary). His brother Nigel was two years his senior. He reunited with his father when the war ended four years later; of their first meeting at Colwyn Bay railway station he recalled: \"I'd only ever been kissed by the smooth lips of a lady up until that point, so his bristly moustache was quite disturbing!\" When Jones was four and a half, the family moved to Claygate, Surrey, England.\nJones attended Esher COE primary school and the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, where he was school captain in the 1960\u201361 academic year. He read English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, but \"strayed into history\". He became interested in the medieval period through reading Chaucer as part of his English degree. He graduated with a . While there, he performed comedy with future Monty Python castmate Michael Palin in the Oxford Revue. Jones was a year ahead of Palin at Oxford, and on first meeting him Palin states, \"The first thing that struck me was what a nice bloke he was. He had no airs and graces. We had a similar idea of what humour could do and where it should go, mainly because we both liked characters; we both appreciated that comedy wasn't just jokes.\"\nCareer history.\nBefore Python and early Python.\nJones appeared in \"Twice a Fortnight\" with Michael Palin, Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie and Jonathan Lynn, as well as the television series \"The Complete and Utter History of Britain\" (1969). He appeared in \"Do Not Adjust Your Set\" (1967\u201369) with Palin, Eric Idle and David Jason. He wrote for \"The Frost Report\" and several other David Frost programmes on British television. Of Jones' contributions as a performer to \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", his depictions of middle-aged women (or \"ratbag old women\" as termed by the BBC, also known as \"pepper-pots\" or \"grannies from hell\") are among the most memorable.\nDirectorial work.\nJones co-directed \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" with Terry Gilliam, and was sole director on two further Monty Python movies, \"Life of Brian\" and \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\". As a film director, Jones finally gained fuller control of the projects and devised a distinct, signature style that relied on visual comedy and surreal touches to complement the jokes. He would repeatedly abandon punchlines and create fragmented, non sequitur story arcs to bring out the deadpan humour. His later films include \"Erik the Viking\" (1989) and \"The Wind in the Willows\" (1996). In 2008, Jones wrote the libretto for and directed the opera \"Evil Machines\". In 2011, he was commissioned to direct and write the libretto for another opera, entitled \"The Doctor's Tale\".\nThree of the films which Jones directed\u2014\"The Meaning of Life\", \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" and \"Personal Services\"\u2014were banned in Ireland.\nJones directed the 2015 comedy film \"Absolutely Anything\", about a disillusioned schoolteacher who is given the chance to do anything he wishes by a group of aliens watching from space. The film features Simon Pegg, Kate Beckinsale, Robin Williams and the voices of the five remaining members of Monty Python. It was filmed in London during a six-week shoot.\nIn 2016, Jones directed \"Jeepers Creepers\", a West End play about the life of comic Marty Feldman. It was his last directing work before his death.\nWriter and brewer.\nJones wrote many books and screenplays, including comic works and more serious writing on medieval history.\nHe also had an interest in real ale, and was a member of the Campaign for Real Ale. In 1977, alongside Peter Austin and Richard Boston, he co-founded the Penrhos Brewery, a microbrewery at Penrhos Court at Penrhos, Herefordshire, which ran until 1983. The former brewery has now become a pub called The Python's Arms.\nComedy.\nJones co-wrote \"Ripping Yarns\" with Palin. They also wrote a play, \"Underwood's Finest Hour\", which was staged at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in 1981, about an obstetrician distracted during a birth by the radio broadcast of a Test match. Jones also wrote numerous works for children, including \"Fantastic Stories\", \"The Beast with a Thousand Teeth\" and a collection of comic verse called \"The Curse of the Vampire's Socks\".\nJones was the co-creator (with Gavin Scott) of the animated TV series \"Blazing Dragons\" (1996\u20131998), which parodied the Arthurian legends and Middle Ages periods. Reversing a common story convention, the series' protagonists are anthropomorphic dragons beset by evil humans.\nScreenplays.\nJones wrote the screenplay for \"Labyrinth\" (1986), although his draft went through several rewrites and several other writers before being filmed; consequently, much of the finished film was not actually written by Jones.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"[you] speak to him on subjects as diverse as fossil fuels, or Rupert Bear, or mercenaries in the Middle Ages or Modern China\u00a0... in a moment you will find yourself hopelessly out of your depth, floored by his knowledge.\"\n\u2014Python biographer George Perry on Jones\nJones wrote books and presented television documentaries on medieval and ancient history. His first book was \"Chaucer's Knight: The Portrait of a Medieval Mercenary\" (1980), which offers an alternative take on Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Knight's Tale\". Chaucer's knight is often interpreted as a paragon of Christian virtue, but Jones asserts that if one studies historical accounts of the battles the knight claims he was involved in, he can be interpreted as a typical mercenary and a potentially cold-blooded killer. He also co-wrote \"Who Murdered Chaucer?\" (2003) in which he argues that Chaucer was close to King Richard II, and that after Richard was deposed, Chaucer was persecuted to death by Thomas Arundel.\nJones' TV series also frequently challenged popular views of history. For example, in \"Terry Jones' Medieval Lives\" (2004; for which he received a 2004 Emmy nomination for \"Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming\") he argues that the Middle Ages was a more sophisticated period than is popularly thought, and \"Terry Jones' Barbarians\" (2006) presents the cultural achievements of peoples conquered by the Roman Empire in a more positive light than Roman historians typically have, attributing the sack of Rome in AD 410 to propaganda.\nColumn writing.\nJones wrote numerous columns for \"The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph\" and \"The Observer\" condemning the Iraq War. Many of these editorials were published in a paperback collection titled \"Terry Jones's War on the War on Terror\".\nIn November 2011, his book \"Evil Machines\" was launched by the online publishing house Unbound at the Adam Street Club in London. It was the first book to be published by a crowdfunding website dedicated solely to books. Jones provided significant support to Unbound as they developed their publishing concept. In February 2018, Jones released \"The Tyrant and the Squire\", also with Unbound.\nPoetry.\nJones was a member of the Poetry Society, and his poems have appeared in \"Poetry Review\".\nWork with musicians.\nJones performed with the Carnival Band and appears on their 2007 CD \"Ringing the Changes\".\nIn January 2008, the Teatro S\u00e3o Luiz, in Lisbon, Portugal, premiered \"Evil Machines\"\u2014a musical play, written by Jones (based on his book), with original music by Portuguese composer Luis Tinoco. Jones was invited by the Teatro S\u00e3o Luiz to write and direct the play, after a successful run of \"Contos Fant\u00e1sticos\", a short play based on Jones' \"Fantastic Stories\", also with music by Tinoco.\nIn January 2012 Jones announced that he was working with songwriter/producer Jim Steinman on a heavy metal version of \"The Nutcracker\".\nAs performer.\nApart from a cameo in Terry Gilliam's \"Jabberwocky\" and a minor role as a drunken vicar in the BBC sitcom \"The Young Ones\", Jones rarely appeared in work outside his own projects. From 2009 to 2011, however, he provided narration for \"The Legend of Dick and Dom\", a CBBC fantasy series set in the Middle Ages. He also appears in two French films by Albert Dupontel: \"Le Cr\u00e9ateur\" (1999) and \"Enferm\u00e9s dehors\" (2006).\nIn 2009, Jones took part in the BBC Wales programme \"Coming Home\" about his Welsh family history. In July 2014, Jones reunited with the other four living Pythons to perform at ten dates (\"Monty Python Live (Mostly)\") at the O2 Arena in London. This was Jones' last performance with the group prior to his aphasia diagnosis.\nIn October 2016, Jones received a standing ovation at the BAFTA Cymru Awards when he received a Lifetime Achievement award for his outstanding contribution to television and film.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages.\nJones married Alison Telfer in 1970; they had two children together, Sally in 1974 and Bill in 1976. They lived in Camberwell, London and had an open marriage. In 2009, Jones left Telfer for Anna S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m; she was 41 years his junior and they had been in a relationship for five years. In September 2009, S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m and Jones had a daughter, and in 2012 they married. The family settled in Highgate, North London.\nPolitical views.\nIn a 1984 interview, Jones stated \"if I had any political convictions, I would say that I am an anarchist\", stating that anarchism was a belief in government from the bottom up, rather than something imposed from above.\nJones published a number of articles on political and social commentary, principally in newspapers \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"The Guardian\", \"The Independent\" and \"The Observer\". Many of these articles mocked the war on terror, belittling it as \"declaring war on an abstract noun\" and comparing it to attempting to \"annihilate mockery\".\nIn August 2014, Jones was one of 200 public figures who signed a letter to \"The Guardian\" expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue.\nHealth and death.\nIn October 2006, Jones was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery. After a course of chemotherapy, he was declared free of the disease. Later reminiscing about the event, he said, \"Unfortunately, my illness is not nearly bad enough to sell many newspapers and the prognosis is even more disappointing.\"\nIn 2015, Jones was diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a form of frontotemporal dementia that impairs the ability to speak and communicate. He had first given cause for concern during the Monty Python reunion show \"Monty Python Live (Mostly)\" in July 2014 because of difficulties learning his lines. He became a campaigner for awareness of, and fundraiser for research into, dementia; he donated his brain for dementia research. By September 2016, he was no longer able to give interviews. By April 2017, he had lost the ability to say more than a few words of agreement.\nOn 21 January 2020, Jones died at his home in Highgate from complications of dementia. His family and close friends remembered him with a humanist funeral ceremony.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has played Derek \"Del Boy\" Trotter in the sitcom \"Only Fools and Horses\", Detective Inspector Jack Frost in the drama series \"A Touch of Frost,\" Granville in the sitcoms \"Open All Hours\" and \"Still Open All Hours,\" and Pop Larkin in the comedy drama series \"The Darling Buds of May\", as well as voicing several cartoon characters, including Mr. Toad in \"The Wind in the Willows\", the BFG in the 1989 film of the same name, and the title characters of \"Danger Mouse\" and \"Count Duckula\".\nIn September 2006, Jason had topped the poll to find TV's 50 Greatest Stars, as part of ITV's 50th anniversary celebrations. He was knighted in 2005 for services to acting and comedy. Jason has won four British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs), (1988, 1991, 1997, 2003), four British Comedy Awards (1990, 1992, 1997, 2001) and seven National Television Awards (1996 twice, 1997, 2001 twice, 2002 and 2011).\nEarly life.\nJason's father, Arthur Robert White, was a porter at Billingsgate Fish Market, and his mother, Olwen Jones, was from Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorgan, Wales, and worked as a charwoman. She gave birth to twin boys at North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton, London, on 2 February 1940, but Jason's twin brother died during childbirth, and making him a twinless twin. He chose the stage name Jason because he liked \"Jason and the Argonauts\", as the stage name \"David White\" was already taken, and not in tribute to his dead twin as has sometimes been claimed.\nJason lived at Lodge Lane, North Finchley, and attended Northfield Secondary Modern school after failing the 11-plus in 1951. Upon leaving school, Jason wanted to be an actor, influenced by his elder brother (Arthur White), but their father advised that he first learn a trade. He trained as an electrician for six years, before retiring and becoming a struggling actor.\nJason's elder brother is the actor Arthur White, born in 1933. The two appeared together in the crime drama \"A Touch of Frost\", with Arthur playing police archivist Ernie Trigg; and again in 2008, in the comic fantasy \"The Colour of Magic\", where Arthur played a character called \"Rerpf\". He also appeared briefly with his brother in two episodes of \"The Darling Buds of May\".\nWhen Jason was 15, he spent a year working as a mechanic's assistant. When he turned 16, he was eligible to register for an apprenticeship, but decided against it.\nRadio and TV career.\nEarly years.\nJason started his television career in the made-for-TV film \"Mother Goose\" (1965). He played Bert Bradshaw in \"Crossroads\" in 1966. In the following year, he played spoof super-hero Captain Fantastic, among other roles, in the children's comedy series \"Do Not Adjust Your Set\" (Rediffusion London/ITV) with Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Denise Coffey, and Michael Palin. Humphrey Barclay, who recruited Jason to appear in \"Do Not Adjust Your Set\" (partly to counter the more highbrow style of Idle, Jones, and Palin), admired his sense of timing. The programme ended in 1969, and the character then appeared for a time in the Thames Television children's programme \"Magpie\". Jason appeared in the BBC comedy series \"Hugh and I\" in 1967, which starred Hugh Lloyd and Terry Scott as two friends who lived together in South London. He appeared in the \"Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)\" episode \"That's How Murder Snowballs\" (1969) as Abel, a framed performer in a major London theatre.\nIn 1968, Jason was initially cast in the role of Lance Corporal Jones in the Jimmy Perry and David Croft BBC comedy \"Dad's Army\". Croft had been very impressed with Jason and believed that he had the talent to play a man much older than his real age (though he was only 28 at the time) but BBC executive Bill Cotton overruled him, casting Clive Dunn because he was better known. According to Jason, \"I was cast at 12 o'clock and sacked by three.\" Jason also missed out on the starring role of Frank Spencer in \"Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em\" in 1973 because BBC executives at the time believed that he lacked \"star quality\".\nIn the 1970s, he also acted in radio comedies, including the weekly topical satire \"Week Ending\" (in which he regularly played such figures as then UK Foreign Secretary Dr David Owen) and \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (as the \"B Ark Captain\" in the sixth episode). Jason also appeared in \"The Next Programme Follows Almost Immediately\" and made appearances on panel games such as \"The Impressionists\" as well as his own series, \"The Jason Explanation\". In the early 1970s, he appeared in \"Mostly Monkhouse\".\nJason appeared on stage in the West End in the farce \"No Sex Please, We're British\" playing Brian Runnicles for 18 months in 1973. He also starred with Valerie Leon in a stage comedy \"Darling Mr London\" which toured in 1975.\nJason appeared in variety shows as the supporting act of Dick Emery and his performances caught the attention of Ronnie Barker. Jason was recruited to appear in \"Hark at Barker\" (LWT, 1969), starring opposite Barker's Lord Rustless, as Dithers, the 100-year old gardener. There was also a sequel, \"His Lordship Entertains\" (1972) for the BBC. Jason played idealistic employee Granville in the first programme of the comedy anthology \"Seven of One\" (1973), called \"Open All Hours\" (BBC) and starring Barker as the curmudgeonly proprietor of a corner shop.\nFour series of \"Open All Hours\" were made from 1976 to 1985. He featured in Barker's \"Porridge\" (BBC), a prison comedy, as the elderly Blanco in three episodes. Jason also appeared with Barker in various disguises in \"The Two Ronnies,\" including providing the \"raspberry\" sound effect for \"The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town.\"\nJason starred in London Weekend Television's \"Lucky Feller\" (1975\u201376), written by Terence Frisby and produced by Humphrey Barclay. About two brothers in south-east London, the series was in many ways a forerunner to \"Only Fools And Horses\". He played the lead role of Peter Barnes in the ATV sitcom \"A Sharp Intake of Breath\" (1977\u201381), alongside Alun Armstrong and Richard Wilson. In 1979, he appeared as Buttons in the pantomime \"Cinderella\" at Newcastle's Theatre Royal, starring Leah Bell and Bobby Thompson, produced by Michael Grayson and directed by John Blackmore.\nChildren's television.\nIn the 1980s, Jason developed a working partnership with Cosgrove Hall, and was a voice-over artist for a number of children's television productions. This included voices for \"Danger Mouse\", \"The BFG\", \"Count Duckula\", Hugo from \"Victor and Hugo\", and Toad from \"The Wind in the Willows\", all produced by Cosgrove Hall for Thames Television/ITV. He provided the voice of Father Christmas in \"Father Christmas and the Missing Reindeer\", Rola Polar in \"The Adventures of Dawdle the Donkey\", \"Angelmouse\", and did voices in animated films including \"Wombling Free\" and \"The Water Babies\".\nTransition into a leading man.\nIn 1981, Jason was cast as Del Boy Trotter in the BBC situation comedy \"Only Fools and Horses\", created by John Sullivan. Del is a wide boy who makes a dishonest living in Peckham, south London, trading in broken, stolen, and counterfeit goods. He is assisted by his brother Rodney (played by Nicholas Lyndhurst) and Grandad (played by Lennard Pearce) and, in later episodes, Uncle Albert (played by Buster Merryfield).\nIn 1989, Jason starred as Ted Simcock in the ITV drama series \"A Bit of a Do\", aired from January to December.\nIn 1999, Jason starred as Captain Frank Beck in BBC's feature-length drama \"All the King's Men\" about the Sandringham regiment lost in World War I. He earned acclaim for a string of serious roles. These include Skullion in \"Porterhouse Blue\" (for Channel 4), Sidney \"Pop\" Larkin in the rural idyll \"The Darling Buds of May\" (Yorkshire Television/ITV), based on the H. E. Bates novel, which also featured Catherine Zeta-Jones.\nIn 1992, he signed a golden handcuffs deal with ITV to star as Detective Inspector Jack Frost in the long-running TV series \"A Touch of Frost\" (Yorkshire Television/ITV). In September 2006, he was voted by the general public as No. 1 in ITV's poll of TV's Greatest Stars. In December 2006, he starred in \"Terry Pratchett's Hogfather\" on Sky1 as Albert. In early 2007, he starred in \"Diamond Geezer\" (Granada Television/ITV). This series ran for 3 episodes of 90 minutes each. There was a pilot in 2005. In March 2008, he starred as Rincewind in \"Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic\", and in the two part ITV drama \"Ghostboat\".\nOn 16 September 2008, Jason announced that he would step down from his role as Jack Frost after 16 years. Three new episodes of the show were shown in autumn 2008, and were followed by a two-part finale in 2010. Approached by BBC1 controller Danny Cohen in early 2011, he read three scripts and agreed to shoot a pilot for \"The Royal Bodyguard\", which was shown at the Edinburgh Film Festival. The pilot episode aired on the BBC on Boxing Day but received a poor critical response. The series was axed after six episodes. In 2010, Jason starred in a made-for-TV movie \"Come Rain Come Shine\" with Alison Steadman for ITV about an elderly Millwall supporter.\nSince 2013, he has starred in \"Still Open All Hours\". It features many original cast members (and a portrait of Ronnie Barker as Arkwright) and is still written by Roy Clarke, the original writer and creator of the show. He has also starred as Captain Skipper, a sea captain, sea dog and Pip's uncle in the animated series \"Pip Ahoy!\".\nIn December 2021, Jason made a surprise cameo appearance on the Christmas Special of \"Strictly Come Dancing\" in the role of Del Boy to pass on a special message to \"The Repair Shop\"'s Jay Blades, who was performing to the \"Only Fools and Horses\" theme tune.\nHonours.\nIn 1993, Jason was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). Twelve years later, in the Queen's Birthday Honours List of 2005, he was knighted for services to acting and comedy. Upon receiving the knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on 1 December 2005, he said he was \"humbled\" by the \"fantastic tribute\".\nPersonal life.\nJason lived with his long-term girlfriend, Welsh actress Myfanwy Talog, for 18 years and nursed her through breast cancer until she died in 1995.\nOn 26 February 2001, Jason became a father at the age of 61 when his girlfriend, 41-year-old Gill Hinchcliffe, gave birth to a girl in Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury. Jason and Hinchcliffe married in 2005 and live in Ellesborough, Buckinghamshire.\nIn 2022, Jason discovered that he had another daughter, of whom he had been previously unaware, who was born in 1970 following a brief relationship with actress Jennifer Hill.\nJason is a patron of the Shark Trust, a United Kingdom registered charity working to advance the worldwide conservation of sharks through science, education, influence and action. He has also been Honorary Vice Patron of the Royal International Air Tattoo since 1999, and on 29 May 2014, presented a cheque on behalf of the Fairford-based \"RAF Charitable Trust\" for \u00a3125,000 to the RAF Air Cadet Organisation, to fund flight simulators for Air Cadets. Jason is a qualified helicopter pilot.\nJason has expressed a negative opinion of the European Union (EU), being quoted in a 2012 interview with \"the Germans want to run Europe. The irony is that here we are, the world has changed, and the Germans want to run Europe. They failed to do it by war, twice. What is it? Is this the Fourth Reich?\"\nIn October 2013, he released his autobiography called \"David Jason: My Life\". It was shortlisted for the 2013 Specsavers National Book Awards \"Best Book of the Year\". A second volume, \"Only Fools and Stories: From Del Boy to Granville, Pop Larkin to Frost\", was published in October 2017. Penguin Books announced \"A Del Of A Life\", which is Jason's third autobiography and was published in October 2020.\nIn September 2017, it was reported that a \"credible threat was made to his life\", although it is not known why Jason had been targeted.\nAwards and nominations.\nJason won a total of eighteen awards between 1986 and 2011. His hit comedy show \"Only Fools and Horses\" won many awards. His crime drama \"A Touch of Frost\" has also won and been nominated numerous times. \"Porterhouse Blue\", \"The Second Quest\", \"All the King's Men\" and \"A Bit of a Do\" have won David Jason one award each.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is largely related to insufficient or dysfunctional filtering of blood by the kidneys. It can lead to uremia and acute kidney injury (kidney failure) if not controlled.\nTypes.\nAzotemia has three classifications, depending on its causative origin: prerenal azotemia, renal azotemia, and postrenal azotemia.\nMeasurements of urea and creatinine (Cr) in the blood are used to assess renal function. For historical reasons, the lab test measuring urea is known as \"blood urea nitrogen\" (BUN) in the US. The BUN:Cr ratio is a useful measure in determining the type of azotemia and will be discussed in each section below. A normal BUN:Cr is equal to 15.\nPrerenal azotemia.\nPrerenal azotemia is caused by a decrease in blood flow (hypoperfusion) to the kidneys. However, there is no inherent kidney disease. It can occur following hemorrhage, shock, volume depletion, congestive heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, and narrowing of the renal artery among other things.\nThe BUN:Cr in prerenal azotemia is greater than 20. The reason for this lies in the mechanism of filtration of urea and creatinine. Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) is decreased due to hypoperfusion which results in a proportional decrease in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). In turn, the decreased flow and pressure to the kidney will be sensed by baroreceptors in the Juxtaglomerular (JG) Cells of the afferent arteriole. If the decrease in blood pressure is systemic (rather than occlusion of the renal artery), baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch will be stimulated. This leads to sympathetic nerve activation, resulting in renin secretion through \u03b21 receptors. Constriction of the afferent arterioles causes a decrease in the intraglomerular pressure, reducing GFR proportionally. Renin is the main effector of the juxtaglomerular baroreceptors. Renin is secreted from granules in the JG cells, and once in the blood stream, it acts as a protease to convert angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted by angiotensin converting enzyme, to angiotensin II, which, in turn, stimulates aldosterone release. Increased aldosterone levels results in salt and water absorption in the distal collecting tubule.\nA decrease in volume or pressure is a non-osmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone production in the hypothalamus, which exerts its effect in the medullary collecting duct for water reabsorption. Through unknown mechanisms, activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water, as well as urea (BUN), calcium, uric acid, and bicarbonate. The net result of these 4 mechanisms of salt and water retention is decreased output and decreased urinary excretion of sodium (&lt; 20mEq/L). The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood. In contrast, creatinine is actually secreted in the proximal tubule. This generally leads to a BUN:Cr ratio greater than 20, a fractional excretion of Na of less than 1%, and an elevated urine osmolarity.\nPrimary renal azotemia.\nRenal azotemia (acute kidney failure) typically leads to uremia. It is an intrinsic disease of the kidney, generally the result of kidney parenchymal damage. Causes include kidney failure, glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, or other kidney disease.\nThe BUN:Cr in renal azotemia is less than 15. In cases of kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate decreases, so nothing gets filtered as well as it normally would. However, in addition to not being normally filtered, what urea does get filtered is not reabsorbed by the proximal tubule as it normally would be. This results in lower levels of urea in the blood and higher levels of urea in the urine as compared to creatinine. Creatinine filtration decreases, leading to a higher amount of creatinine in the blood. Third-spacing of fluids, as in peritonitis, osmotic diuresis, or low aldosterone states such as Addison's disease all elevate urea.\nPostrenal azotemia.\nBlockage of urine flow in an area below the kidneys results in postrenal azotemia. It can be caused by congenital abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux, blockage of the ureters by kidney stones, pregnancy, compression of the ureters by cancer, prostatic hyperplasia, or blockage of the urethra by kidney or bladder stones. Like in prerenal azotemia, there is no inherent renal disease. The increased resistance to urine flow can cause back up into the kidneys, leading to hydronephrosis.\nThe BUN:Cr in postrenal azotemia is initially &gt;15. The increased nephron tubular pressure (due to fluid back-up) causes increased reabsorption of urea, elevating it abnormally relative to creatinine. Persistent obstruction damages the tubular epithelium over time, and renal azotemia will result with a decreased BUN:Cr ratio.\nSigns and symptoms.\nA urinalysis will typically show a decreased urine sodium level, a high urine creatinine-to-serum creatinine ratio, a high urine urea-to-serum urea ratio, and concentrated urine (determined by osmolality and specific gravity). None of these is particularly useful in diagnosis.\nIn pre-renal and post-renal azotemias, elevation of urea exceeds that of the creatinine (i.e., BUN&gt;12*creatinine). This is because urea is readily reabsorbed by the kidneys while creatinine is not. In congestive heart failure (a cause of pre-renal azotemia) or any other condition that causes poor perfusion of kidneys, the sluggish flow of glomerular filtrate results in excessive absorption of urea and elevation of its value in blood. Creatinine, however, is not absorbable and therefore does not rise significantly. Stasis of urine in post-renal azotemia has the same effect.\nTreatment.\nPrompt treatment of some causes of azotemia can result in restoration of kidney function; delayed treatment may result in permanent loss of renal function. Treatment may include hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, medications to increase cardiac output and increase blood pressure, and the treatment of the condition that caused the azotemia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "51804", "revid": "461496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51804", "title": "Stars and Stripes (newspaper)", "text": "US military newspaper\nStars and Stripes is a daily American military newspaper reporting on matters concerning the members of the United States Armed Forces and their communities, with an emphasis on those serving outside the United States. It operates from inside the Department of Defense, but is editorially separate from it, and its First Amendment protection is safeguarded by the United States Congress to whom an independent ombudsman, who serves the readers' interests, regularly reports. As well as a website, \"Stars and Stripes\" publishes a global daily print edition for U.S. military service members serving overseas Monday through Friday. This global edition is also available as a free download in electronic format. The newspaper has its headquarters in Washington, D.C.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nOn November 9, 1861, during the Civil War, soldiers of the 11th, 18th, and 29th Illinois Regiments set up camp in the Missouri city of Bloomfield. Finding the local newspaper's office empty, they decided to print a newspaper about their activities. They called it the \"Stars and Stripes\". Tradition holds this as the origin story for the newspaper, and the Stars and Stripes Museum/Library Association is located in Bloomfield.\nWorld War I.\nDuring World War I, the staff, roving reporters, and illustrators of the \"Stars and Stripes\" were veteran reporters or young soldiers who would later become such in the post-war years. It was published by the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) from February 8, 1918, to June 13, 1919. Harold Ross, editor of the \"Stars and Stripes\", returned home to found \"The New Yorker\" magazine. Cyrus Baldridge, its art director and principal illustrator, became a major illustrator of books and magazines, as well as a writer, print maker and stage designer. Sports page editor Grantland Rice had a long career in journalism and founded a motion picture studio called Grantland Rice Sportlight. Drama critic Alexander Woollcott's essays for \"Stars and Stripes\" were collected in his 1919 book, \"The Command Is Forward\".\nThe \"Stars and Stripes\" was then an eight-page weekly which reached a peak of 526,000 readers, relying on the improvisational efforts of its staff to get it printed in France and distributed to U.S. troops.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, the newspaper was printed in dozens of editions in several operating theaters. Again, both newspapermen in uniform and young soldiers, some of whom would later become important journalists, filled the staffs. Some of the editions were assembled and printed very close to the front in order to get the latest information to the most troops. Also, during the war, the newspaper published the 53-book series \"G.I. Stories\". The Rome edition closed in 1945 and its printing press was transferred to the new \"Rome Daily American\" in an arrangement facilitated by the CIA.\nAfter Bill Mauldin did his popular \"Up Front\" cartoons for the World War II \"Stars and Stripes\", he returned home to a successful career as an editorial cartoonist and two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist and war correspondent Ernie Pyle was regularly published in the \"Stars and Stripes\" before he was killed by a Japanese machine-gunner on Iejima during the Battle of Okinawa.\nThe magazine frequently posted photographs of a young Marilyn Monroe, then known as Norma Jeane Dougherty, which later led her as being named \"Miss Cheesecake 1952\" by \"Stars and Stripes\".\nModern era.\nFunding and relevance in the digital age have threatened the paper's budget. In 2013, the paper faced job cuts, printing-schedule changes, a pay-raise freeze and travel limitations for staff under the Federal budget sequestration. The print newspapers provide the news back home to service members who are forward-deployed in areas lacking reliable internet access. Coverage of pay and benefits is of direct concern to service members and their families along with life on base and in the field. The paper helps them be better-informed citizens about global geopolitics. Budget cuts by the Pentagon were again considered in 2016.\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" reported in February 2020, that a draft budget would reduce the newspaper's federal support in 2021 under a $5 billion shift to higher priorities in the defense budget. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Elaine McCusker indicated its funding would be cut and said: \"We have essentially decided that, you know, kind of coming into the modern age that newspaper is probably not the best way that we communicate any longer.\" The subsidy is more than $15 million a year, which represents approximately half the publication's budget and roughly 0.002 percent of the Department of Defense budget, which was $721,500 million in 2020. It was described by the \"Stars and Stripes\" ombudsman as \"a fatal cut\".&lt;ref name=\"WP 2020/06/18\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Defense Secretary Mark Esper justified the decision to discontinue publication of the paper as a result of his department-wide budget review. An order for the newspaper to shutter was issued, specifically by presenting a plan for it to dissolve by September 15,\u00a0including \"specific timeline for vacating government owned/leased space worldwide\" and to end publication by September 30, 2020.

He joined the Nazi Party in 1928 and was the \"Gauleiter\" of North Westphalia from 1931 to 1945, the \"Oberpr\u00e4sident\" of the Province of Westphalia from 1938 to 1945 and the \"Reichsstatthalter\" of Lippe and Schaumburg-Lippe from 1933 to 1945. In 1941 he became the Permanent Deputy to the \"Reichsminister\" of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories. He represented the ministry with Georg Leibbrandt in the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which the genocidal Final Solution to the Jewish Question was planned. Near the end of World War II in Europe, Meyer committed suicide in April 1945.\nEarly life.\nMeyer was born in G\u00f6ttingen, the son of a Prussian civil servant who was stationed there for his official duties. The middle-class family was originally from Essen. He was educated at the Gymnasium in Soest, graduating in 1911. \nA conservative and a monarchist, Meyer aspired to become a Prussian military officer. However, upon graduation, he entered the University of Lausanne to study law. After one term in Lausanne, he unexpectedly received an appointment as a \"Fahnenjunker\" (cadet officer) with the 68th (6th Rhenish) Infantry Regiment in Koblenz in 1912. He passed his officer exam and was commissioned as a \"Leutnant\" on 16 June 1913. During World War I he fought with Infantry Regiment 363 on the Western Front, earning the Iron Cross first and second class and the Wound Badge. Promoted to \"Oberleutnant\" in June 1916, he was wounded and captured by the French in April 1917. This experience, according to Meyer, was especially traumatic and left him with a hatred against France. Released from captivity in March 1920, the downsized \"Reichswehr\" had no use for him and he left the army in October with the rank of \"Hauptmann\".\nAfter the war, Meyer studied jurisprudence and political science at the Universities of Bonn and W\u00fcrzburg. He graduated with a PhD in 1922 and joined the legal department of a Gelsenkirchen mining firm. In 1924, he joined the local Masonic lodge. Meyer was also the chairman of the local \"Kyffh\u00e4userbund\" unit. He married Dorothee Capell in 1925 and had five daughters with her.\nCareer in Nazi Germany.\nThe Nazi Party was still extremely weak in Westphalia during the late 1920s, and had only about three hundred members in the city of Gelsenkirchen during this period. On 1 April 1928, Meyer joined the Party (membership number 28,738). As an early Party member, he would later be awarded the Golden Party Badge. Later that year, he rose to the position of \"Ortsgruppenleiter\" (Local Group Leader) and, on 1 October 1929, he was promoted to \"Bezirksleiter\" (District Leader) of the Emscher-Lippe district within Westphalia. In November 1929, he was also elected as the only Nazi party representative to the Gelsenkirchen city council where he remained until January 1931.\nIn September 1930, Meyer was elected to the \"Reichstag\" from electoral constituency 17, Westphalia North, and on 31 January 1931, he was appointed the Nazi Party \"Gauleiter\" of the newly-formed Gau Westphalia-North. He also became the editor of the local Party newspaper, the \"Westf\u00e4lische Landeszeitung Rot-Erde\". On 24 April 1932, he was elected to the Prussian \"Landtag\" and was returned to the \"Reichstag\" on 6 November 1932. Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Meyer was appointed to the Westphalia Provincial \"Landtag\" on 12 March, becoming its president in April. On 10 April, he was made the province's plenipotentiary to the \"Reichsrat\", serving until its abolition on 14 February 1934. Adolf Hitler appointed him as the federal \"Reichsstatthalter\" (Reich Governor) of the German States of Lippe and Schaumburg-Lippe on 16 May 1933. He was again returned to the \"Reichstag\" at the election of 12 November 1933, retaining his seat until the fall of the Nazi regime. On 1 August 1934, he was named to Hans Frank's Academy for German Law. Additionally, he also became the \"Staatsminister\" (Minister of State) in charge of the state government of Lippe, succeeding Hans-Joachim Riecke, effective 1 February 1936. He also was named a Minister of State in the Schaumburg-Lippe government of \"Landespr\u00e4sident\" (State President) Karl Dreier. Finally, on 4 November 1938 he was made \"Oberpr\u00e4sident\" of the Prussian Province of Westphalia, thus uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in his jurisdictions. In the Nazi paramilitary organization, the \"Sturmabteilung\", he was promoted to SA-\"Gruppenf\u00fchrer\" on 20 April 1936 and to SA-\"Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\" on 9 November 1938.\nOn 6 September 1939, Meyer was made \"Chef der Zivilverwaltung\" (Chief of Civil Administration) in the West. On 29 May 1940 he was appointed Acting Reich Defense Commissioner for Military District VI during the absence in Norway of Josef Terboven. On 17 July 1941 he was named \"St\u00e4ndiger Stellvertreter\" (permanent deputy) to \"Reichsminister\" Alfred Rosenberg in the newly-established Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories (RMO). Meyer was responsible for the departments of politics, administration and economics. In his role in the East, he used workers that were mainly Jewish for slave labor assigned to a variety of works. \nWannsee Conference participant.\nOn 20 January 1942, Meyer was Rosenberg's representative at the Wannsee Conference, which was called to discuss the implementation of the Final Solution. The official minutes of the conference indicate that Meyer and Josef B\u00fchler, the representative of the General Government, both expressed the opinion that preparatory measures for the Final Solution should be carried out immediately in their respective jurisdictions. Nine days after the conference, Meyer convened a meeting at the RMO office for representatives of several other ministries and the \"armed forces high command\" (OKW). The RMO representatives advocated broadening the definition of who was a Jew. They supported the position of SS-\"Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\" Reinhard Heydrich, who had chaired the Wannsee meeting, that \"Mischlinge\" of the first degree should be included. Meyer wrote a letter on 16 July 1942 proposing that a request be addressed to Hitler urging that a decision be made on the \"Mischlinge\" question.\nDefeat and death.\nOn 16 November 1942, Meyer was made Reich Defense Commissioner for his \"Gau\". During the war, he was awarded the War Merit Cross, 1st and 2nd class with Swords. On 25 September 1944, he became the commander of Nazi \"Volksturm\" militia forces in his \"Gau\". He made plans to construct a \"Westphalia Wall\" to serve as a defensive position but the Allied assault proved unstoppable, and M\u00fcnster fell to the combined British and American forces on 3 April 1945. In mid-May 1945, a body, decomposed beyond recognition but later determined to be Meyer, was found in Hessisch Oldendorf by the River Weser. Next to the body was a pistol and a suicide note, in which the unrepentant Nazi wrote: \"The last part of my \"Gau\" was lost today. We defended Rinteln and the Weser bravely. In the last free part of my \"Gau\" I take leave of the \"F\u00fchrer\", to whom my most heartfelt wishes belong, [and] of Germany.\"\nFictional portrayals.\nMeyer was portrayed by Harald Dietl in the 1984 German film \"Die Wannseekonferenz\", by Brian Pettifer in the 2001 BBC/HBO film \"Conspiracy\" and by Peter Jordan in the 2022 German film \"Die Wannseekonferenz\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He produced fighter aircraft in Germany during the First World War such as the Eindecker monoplanes, the Dr.1 triplane and the D.VII biplane.\nAfter the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to produce aircraft, Fokker moved his business to the Netherlands. There, his company was responsible for a variety of aircraft including the Fokker F.VII/3m trimotor, a successful interwar passenger aircraft. He died in New York City in 1939. Later authors suggest he was personally charismatic but unscrupulous in business and a controversial character.\nEarly life.\nAnthony (Tony) Fokker was born in Blitar, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), to Herman Fokker, a Dutch coffee plantation owner and Johanna Hugona Wouterina Wilhelmina Diemont. Some sources say that he was born in Kediri. At that time, Blitar was a part of the \"Kediri Residency\", a colonial administrative division the capital of which was Kediri. He was a cousin of the physicist Adriaan Fokker.\nWhen Fokker was four, the family returned to the Netherlands and settled in Haarlem in order to provide Fokker and his older sister, Toos, with a Dutch upbringing.\nFokker was not a studious boy and did not complete his high school education. However, he showed an early interest in mechanics, and preferred making things, playing with model trains and steam engines, and experimenting with model aeroplane designs.\nAs a high school student, he devoted considerable effort to the development of a wheel that would not suffer from punctures; basically a wheel with a perimeter formed by a series of metal plates.\nMove to Germany.\nFokker's interest in flight stemmed from Wilbur Wright's exhibition flights in France in the summer and fall of 1908. In 1910, aged 20, Fokker was sent by his father to Germany to receive training as an automobile mechanic at Bingen Technical school, but his interest was in flying, so he transferred to the Erste deutsche Automobil-Fachschule in Mainz. That same year Fokker built his first aircraft \"de Spin\" (\"the Spider\"), which was destroyed when his business partner flew it into a tree. He gained his flying certificate in his second \"\"Spin\" aircraft, which shortly thereafter was also destroyed by the same business partner, prompting Fokker to end their relationship. In his own country, he became a celebrity by flying around the tower of the Grote or St.-Bavokerk in Haarlem on 1 September 1911, with the third version of the \"Spin\"\". One day earlier, on Queen's Day (31 August, Queen Wilhelmina's birthday), Fokker had already taken the opportunity to make a couple of demonstration flights in Haarlem in the same aircraft.\nIn 1912, Fokker moved to Johannisthal near Berlin, where he founded his first own company, \"Fokker Aeroplanbau\". In the following years he constructed a variety of aircraft. He relocated his factory to Schwerin where it was renamed \"Fokker Flugzeugwerke GmbH\", and later shortened to \"Fokker Werke GmbH\".\nInvolvement in World War I.\nAt the outbreak of World War I the German government took control of the factory. Fokker remained as director and alleged designer of many aircraft for the Imperial German Army Air Service (\"Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte\"), including the Fokker \"Eindecker\" and the Fokker Dr.I, the triplane made famous in the hands of aces such as Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron). In all, his company delivered about 700 military aircraft to the German air force as well as supplying the German navy and Austria-Hungary.\nFokker himself was a skilled pilot, demonstrating his aircraft on many occasions. On 13 June 1915, Fokker demonstrated the new \"Eindecker\" (monoplane) at Stenay in the German 5th Army Sector in front of the German Crown Prince and other VIPs. Fokker worked closely with an accomplished military pilot, Otto Parschau, to bring the Eindecker into military use and on this occasion both men demonstrated the aircraft. Max Immelmann, later to become a high-scoring flying ace with the \"Eindecker\", commented in a letter written shortly after this event on 25 June 1915 that: \"Fokker, especially, amazed us with his skill\".\nAuthor A.R. Weyl (\"Fokker: The Creative Years\", Putnam 1965) says that, while Fokker was a talented and bold pilot, his business character was more flawed. He failed to reinvest war profits back into his factory which consequently struggled to fulfill contracts as the factory floor was often muddled with prototype development and production taking place at the same time. Fokker distrusted qualified engineers (which he was not), and resented frequent German insistence on carrying out stringent structural tests to ensure prototype aircraft were fit for combat. He could be bad tempered and insensitive, as when he verbally abused his dying designer Martin Kreuzer on the evening of 27 June 1916, after Kreuzer had crashed the prototype Fokker D.I. The rudder jammed, but Kreuzer was able to give an oral report on the accident before he died. \"Fokker hurried to the scene, and shouted reproaches at the mortally injured man\". Weyl says this incident was witnessed by Reinhold Platz, who succeeded Kreuzer.\nWhile Weyl's biography paints an unpleasant picture of Fokker as a businessman, he was a popular and charismatic figure with service pilots, and could charm even senior officers. This charm enabled him to deal with the first major crisis of his German career when his newly delivered Fokker Dr.I triplanes began to experience sudden fatal accidents in late 1917, and the type was temporarily grounded as too dangerous to fly. The triplanes' top wings frequently ripped off under aerobatic conditions and even Lothar von Richthofen (brother of Manfred) was lucky to survive one such crash. Fokker was able to prove to the German high command that the basic design was not at fault, but the German military inquiry concluded that shoddy workmanship due to poor supervision and quality control at the Fokker factory were to blame. Fokker received a stern warning about future conduct. Unfortunately the same scenario repeated itself a few months later, with the introduction of his Fokker E.V/D.VIII monoplane in mid-1918. A further high level German inquiry revealed more production and workmanship issues. Weyl asserts that the German authorities were now willing to file criminal charges against Fokker, and might have done so, had he not returned to the Netherlands shortly after the end of World War I.\nFokker's own account of the D.VIII places the blame on officious German Air Force inspectors requiring an ill-conceived design change. \"When the first D-8 [\"sic\"] was submitted to the engineering division to be sandload tested, the wings proved to be sufficiently strong, but the regulations called for a proportionate strength in the rear spar compared to the front spar\u00a0... Complying with the government's edict, we strengthened the rear spar and started to produce in quantity\u00a0...\" The D.VIIIs immediately ran into trouble with the wing collapsing at high speed. Fokker recalled the aircraft for further testing, and successfully demonstrated that the reinforced rear spar caused the wings to flex unevenly at speed, increasing the angle of attack at the wing tips and causing the wing to shear apart under the increased loads. The problem was resolved by restoring the rear spar to its original specifications.\nWeyl also discusses claims of Fokker's outright plagiarism or taking sole credit for the work of his staff, first designer Martin Kreuzer and later Reinhold Platz. For example, contemporary German documents for the E.V/D.VIII refer to Fokker as \"the designer\" but Weyl and other authors now suggest that Platz was the real design genius behind the Dr.I, D.VII and D.VIII. There may be some truth in this as Platz recalled to Weyl that he attended high level meetings alongside Fokker but was never introduced or referred-to as the designer and often never even spoke. Yet when Fokker fled Germany it was Platz who immediately took over the German works on Fokker's behalf. Fokker later moved Platz to the Netherlands, as head designer, when the post-war German operation collapsed which indicates Platz really did play a greater design role than Fokker admits. Weyl uncharitably suggests that Platz's role at the Fokker D.VIII crisis meetings was to take the blame if anything was wrong and not receive credit. How much of this interpretation is based on the fact that Platz was still alive to tell his side of the story in 1965, and Fokker was not, is unclear.\nAnother book by Henri Hegener (who knew both Fokker and Platz personally) depicts a rather different story, saying that Platz, while a skilled craftsman (and excellent welder), had received no formal technical training, and that his contributions to the Fokker designs are exaggerated, although Hegener grants that Platz was a good \"rule of thumb\" designer. Hegener also contradicts the claims that Platz was treated badly by Fokker, at least not financially because Platz's year-end bonuses often exceeded his yearly salary.\nThe interrupter gear.\nFokker is often credited with having invented the synchronization device which enabled World War I aircraft to fire through the spinning propeller. His role was certainly significant, but there were a number of prior developments before the result was achieved for which Fokker is commonly credited.\nThe famous French pilot Roland Garros was shot down on 18 April 1915. His aircraft had been fitted with a deflector device, consisting of metal deflector wedges fitted to the propeller. Garros was able to set fire to the aircraft before being taken prisoner but the aircraft's gun and the armoured propeller remained intact and came into German hands.\nThis initiated a phase of consideration of the interrupter gear concept in the Imperial German Army Air Service (\"Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte\"). Fokker was heavily involved in this process but the story of his conception, development and installation of a synchronization device in a period of 48 hours (first found in an authorized biography of Fokker written in 1929) has been shown to be not factual. The available evidence points to a synchronisation device having been in development with Fokker's company for perhaps six months prior to the capture of Garros' machine. Additionally there were patents filed in France, Germany and Austria-Hungary as far back as 1910for very similar devices to that produced by Fokker. Author A. J. Weyl suggests that Fokker \u2013 or more probably someone on his production team \u2013 was aware of these patents. One patentee, Franz Schneider and his employer LVG, later sued Fokker in the German courts and won their case; but Fokker (by then in America) refused to pay.\nHowever, the final result of the development was Fokker's pushrod control mechanism, \"Gest\u00e4ngesteuerung\", which allowed the aircraft's forward-firing machine gun to fire only when the propeller was out of the line of fire. Fitted to the famous Fokker \"Eindecker\", its use directly led to a phase of German air superiority known as the Fokker Scourge. Despite its shock effect on the enemy, the first Fokker interrupters remained unreliable and were prone to failures. Both Oswald Boelcke and Max Immelmann survived failures which resulted in propellers being shot off and even engines pulled out of their mountings due to the engine becoming unbalanced by the loss of the propeller. Immelmann's eventual death in combat has also been attributed to interrupter gear failure as the aircraft was seen to break up in mid-air while engaged against a Royal Flying Corps F.E.2b.\nOther works on aircraft armament.\nFokker and his armament team, including L\u00fcbbe and Leimberger, also worked on lesser known projects, including a multi-barrelled machine gun, known as the Fokker-Leimberger. Although superficially similar to a Gatling gun, the action of the Fokker-Leimberger was substantially different. Problems with the gun, especially with ruptured cases, prevented its adoption into production during the war. After moving to the US, Fokker continued to work on the design, but he was ultimately unsuccessful\u2014properly sealing the rotary split-breech was apparently very difficult. A single surviving prototype is known today at the Kentucky Military Treasures.\nReturn to the Netherlands.\nAfter the war's end, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to build any aircraft or aircraft engines. The Armistice, not the Treaty of Versailles, singled out the Fokker D.VII for destruction or confiscation, the only aircraft to be so named. In 1919, Fokker returned to the Netherlands and started a new aircraft company, the \"Nederlandse Vliegtuigenfabriek\" (Dutch Aircraft Factory), predecessor to the Fokker Aircraft Company. Despite the strict disarmament conditions in the treaty, Fokker did not return home empty-handed: he managed to smuggle six goods trains' worth of D.VII and C.I military aircraft and spare parts out of Germany across the German-Dutch border. Author Weyl says that Fokker used 350 railway wagons and made sure that each train was too long to fit into the railway sidings where trains were normally checked for contraband. Weyl quotes Fokker himself as saying that he paid 20,000 Dutch guilders in bribes. The trains included 220 aeroplanes, more than 400 aero engines and much other material. This initial stock enabled him to quickly set up shop, but his focus shifted from military to civil aircraft such as the very successful Fokker F.VII/3m trimotor.\nFokker's admitted bribery has contributed to his reputation for sharp business practices. Weyl also points out that \u2013 in addition to possible criminal charges for the Fokker D.VIII fatal crashes \u2013 Fokker also failed to pay taxes to German authorities, and actually owed more than 14 million marks. Fokker's autobiography tells a similar story, but focuses on the rampant corruption, hyper-inflation, economic meltdown, and violent revolutionary forces of the pre-Weimar days. According to Fokker's account, as WWI progressed, the German High Command became increasingly brazen, even forcing Fokker into German citizenship against his will. Fokker describes his escape from Germany as a harrowing tale in which he protected as many workers as possible and escaped with less than a quarter of his net worth. He takes pains to rebuff the claim that he left the country owing any taxes.\nPersonal life.\nOn 25 March 1919, Fokker married Sophie Marie Elisabeth von Morgen in Haarlem. This marriage ended in divorce in 1923. In 1927, he married Canadian Violet Austman in New York City. On 8 February 1929, she died in a fall from their hotel suite window. The original police report said her death was a suicide, but this was later changed to \"vertigo victim\" at the request of her husband's staff. On the subject of his marriages, Fokker wrote, \"I have always understood airplanes much better than women. I had more love affairs in my life, and they ended just like the first one, really, because I thought there was nothing that could be more important than my airplanes\u00a0... I have now learned, by bitter experience, that one must give a little too; in love one has to use one's brain just as much as in business, and perhaps even more\".&lt;ref name=\"HegenerFOKKER1961/2\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nMove to the US and death.\nIn or about 1926 or 1927, Fokker moved to the United States. Here he established the North American branch of his company, the Atlantic Aircraft Corporation. The company gained high visibility in daring exploits by pilots. The Fokker F.VII aircraft was used by pilot Richard E. Byrd and machinist Floyd Bennett to fly over or near the North Pole on 9 May 1926. In June 1928, Amelia Earhart crossed the Atlantic to Wales in a Fokker F.VII/3m trimotor, and in 1930 Charles Kingsford Smith circumnavigated the globe in another. However the reputation was hurt when the famous University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne was killed in the crash of a Fokker F.10A in March 1931.\nFokker's Dutch and American companies were at the peak of their success in the late 1920s, but he lost control by going public to sell stock. In 1929, General Motors took over Fokker Aircraft Corporation of America, and merged it in the General Aviation Corporation. Fokker was appointed director of engineering. He resigned in 1931. Fokker designs were increasingly outdated and in 1934 General Aviation discontinued their production. They were still built in the Netherlands.\nNeville Shute in 1934 negotiated with Fokker for a manufacturing licensing agreement for Airspeed Ltd (England), and found him \"genial, shrewd and helpful\" but \"already a sick man\"; and he was difficult to deal with as \"his domestic life was irregular\". He worked \"at all hours and in strange places\". Frequently \"his very efficient legal advisor and secretary could not tell us where he was\". Shute said he was \"a good chooser of men\" and had a \"most efficient staff of Dutchmen and ex-Germans\".\nFokker died at age 49 in New York in 1939 from pneumococcal meningitis, after a three-week-long illness. In 1940, his ashes were brought to Westerveld Cemetery in Driehuis, North Holland, where they were buried in the family grave.\nIn 1970, Fokker was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.\nIn 1980, Fokker was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio. \nPopular culture.\nFokker's nickname was \"The Flying Dutchman\". In popular media, Hurd Hatfield portrayed him in the 1971 film \"Von Richthofen and Brown\". The character Roy Fokker from the animated series \"Super Dimension Fortress Macross\" and its prequel \"Macross Zero\" was named in honor of Anthony Fokker and Roy Brown, the Royal Air Force pilot who is officially credited with downing Manfred von Richthofen's Fokker Dr.I. Fokker is portrayed by Craig Kelly in the \"Young Indiana Jones Chronicles: Attack of the Hawkmen\".\nOne of KLM's Boeing 747-200s, registration serial PH-BUN, was named after Fokker and operated for the airline from 1979 until 2004. The aircraft was scrapped after the end of its service with KLM.\nTelevision series.\n\"Turbulent Skies\" is a 2020 Dutch television series comprising eight episodes depicting Anthony Fokker's and Albert Plesman's achievements.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Dr.I saw widespread service in the spring of 1918. It became famous as the aircraft in which Manfred von Richthofen gained his last 17 victories (plus two earlier ones in the Fokker F.I prototype in September 1917), and in which he was killed on 21 April 1918. The Fokker Dr.I was flown with great success by many other German aces, most notably Josef Jacobs with 30 confirmed kills in the type.\nDesign and development.\nIn February 1917, the Sopwith Triplane began to appear over the Western Front. Despite its single Vickers machine gun armament, the Sopwith swiftly proved itself superior to the more heavily armed Albatros fighters then in use by the \"Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte\". In April 1917, Anthony Fokker viewed a captured Sopwith Triplane while visiting \"Jasta\" 11. Upon his return to the Schwerin factory, Fokker instructed Reinhold Platz to build a triplane, but gave him no further information about the Sopwith design. Platz responded with the V.4, a small, rotary-powered triplane with a steel tube fuselage and thick cantilever wings, first developed during Fokker's government-mandated collaboration with Hugo Junkers. Initial tests revealed that the V.4 had unacceptably high control forces resulting from the use of unbalanced ailerons and elevators.\nInstead of submitting the V.4 for a type test, Fokker produced a revised prototype designated V.5. The most notable changes were the introduction of horn-balanced ailerons and elevators, as well as longer-span wings. The V.5 also featured interplane struts, which were not necessary from a structural standpoint, but which minimized wing flexing. On 14 July 1917, \"Idflieg\" issued an order for 20 pre-production aircraft. The V.5 prototype, serial 101/17, was tested to destruction at Adlershof on 11 August 1917.\nOperational history.\nThe first two pre-production triplanes were designated F.I, in accord with \"Idflieg's\" early class prefix for triplanes. These aircraft, serials 102/17 and 103/17, were the only machines to receive the F.I designation and could be distinguished from subsequent aircraft by http:// The two aircraft were sent to \"Jastas\" 10 and 11 for combat evaluation, arriving at Markebeeke, Belgium on 28 August 1917.\nRichthofen first flew 102/17 on 1 September 1917 and shot down two enemy aircraft in the next two days. He reported to the \"Kogenluft\" (\"Kommandierender General der Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte\") that the F.I was superior to the Sopwith Triplane. Richthofen recommended that fighter squadrons be reequipped with the new aircraft as soon as possible. The combat evaluation came to an abrupt conclusion when \"Oberleutnant\" Kurt Wolff, \"Staffelf\u00fchrer\" of \"Jasta\" 11, was shot down in 102/17 on 15 September, and \"Leutnant\" Werner Voss, \"Staffelf\u00fchrer\" of \"Jasta\" 10, was killed in 103/17 on 23 September.\nThe remaining pre-production aircraft, designated Dr.I, were delivered to \"Jasta\" 11. \"Idflieg\" issued a production order for 100 triplanes in September, followed by an order for 200 in November. Apart from the straight leading edge of the tailplane, these aircraft were almost identical to the F.I. The primary distinguishing feature was the addition of wingtip skids, which proved necessary because the aircraft was tricky to land and prone to ground looping. In October, Fokker began delivering the Dr.I to squadrons within Richthofen's \"Jagdgeschwader\" I.\nCompared with the Albatros and Pfalz fighters, the Dr.I offered exceptional maneuverability. Though the ailerons were not very effective, the rudder and elevator controls were light and powerful. Rapid turns, especially to the right, were facilitated by the triplane's marked directional instability. \"Vizefeldwebel\" Franz Hemer of \"Jasta\" 6 said, \"The triplane was my favorite fighting machine because it had such wonderful flying qualities. I could let myself stunt \u2013 looping and rolling \u2013 and could avoid an enemy by diving with perfect safety. The triplane had to be given up because although it was very maneuverable, it was no longer fast enough.\"\nAs Hemer noted, the Dr.I was considerably slower than contemporary Allied fighters in level flight and in a dive. While initial rate of climb was excellent, performance fell off dramatically at higher altitudes because of the low compression of the Oberursel Ur.II, a clone of the Le Rh\u00f4ne 9J rotary engine. As the war continued, chronic shortages of castor oil made rotary operation increasingly difficult. The poor quality of German \"ersatz\" lubricant resulted in many engine failures, particularly during the summer of 1918.\nThe Dr.I suffered other deficiencies. The pilot's view was poor during takeoff and landing. The cockpit was cramped and furnished with materials of inferior quality. Furthermore, the proximity of the gun butts to the cockpit, combined with inadequate crash padding, left the pilot vulnerable to serious head injury in the event of a crash landing.\nWing failures.\nOn 29 October 1917, \"Leutnant der Reserve\" Heinrich Gontermann, \"Staffelf\u00fchrer\" of \"Jasta\" 15, was performing aerobatics when his triplane broke up. Gontermann was killed in the ensuing crash landing. \"Leutnant der Reserve\" G\u00fcnther Pastor of \"Jasta\" 11 was killed two days later when his triplane broke up in level flight. Inspection of the wrecked aircraft showed that the wings had been poorly constructed. Examination of other high-time triplanes confirmed these findings. On 2 November, \"Idflieg\" grounded all remaining triplanes pending an inquiry. \"Idflieg\" convened a \"Sturzkommission\" (crash commission) which concluded that poor construction and lack of waterproofing had allowed moisture to damage the wing structure. This caused the wing ribs to disintegrate and the ailerons to break away in flight.\nIn response to the crash investigation, Fokker was forced to improve quality control on the production line, particularly varnishing of the wing spars and ribs, to combat moisture. Fokker also strengthened the rib structures and the attachment of the auxiliary spars to the ribs. Existing triplanes were repaired and modified at Fokker's expense. After testing a modified wing at Adlershof, \"Idflieg\" authorized the triplane's return to service on 28 November 1917. Production resumed in early December. By January 1918, \"Jastas\" 6 and 11 were fully equipped with the triplane. Only 14 squadrons used the Dr.I as their primary equipment. Most of these units were part of \"Jagdgeschwadern\" I, II, or III. Frontline inventory peaked in late April 1918, with 171 aircraft in service on the Western Front.\nDespite corrective measures, the Dr.I continued to suffer from wing failures. On 3 February 1918, \"Leutnant\" Hans Joachim Wolff of \"Jasta\" 11 successfully landed after suffering a failure of the upper wing leading edge and ribs. On 18 March 1918, Lothar von Richthofen, \"Staffelf\u00fchrer\" of \"Jasta\" 11, suffered a failure of the upper wing leading edge during combat with Sopwith Camels of No. 73 Squadron and Bristol F.2Bs of No. 62 Squadron. Richthofen was seriously injured in the ensuing crash landing.\nPostwar research revealed that poor workmanship was not the only cause of the triplane's structural failures. In 1929, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) investigations found that the upper wing carried a higher lift coefficient than the lower wing \u2013 at high speeds it could be 2.55 times as much.\nThe triplane's chronic structural problems destroyed any prospect of large-scale orders. Production eventually ended in May 1918, by which time only 320 had been manufactured. The Dr.I was withdrawn from frontline service as the Fokker D.VII entered widespread service in June and July. \"Jasta\" 19 was the last squadron to be fully equipped with the Dr.I.\nSurviving triplanes were distributed to training and home defense units. Several training aircraft were reengined with the 75\u00a0kW (100\u00a0hp) Goebel Goe.II. At the time of the Armistice, many remaining triplanes were assigned to fighter training schools at Nivelles, Belgium, and Valenciennes, France. Allied pilots tested several of these triplanes and found their handling qualities to be impressive.\nExperimental engines.\nSeveral Dr.Is were used as testbeds for experimental engines. One aircraft, designated V.7, was fitted with the Siemens-Halske Sh.III bi-rotary engine. The V.7 exhibited exceptional rate of climb and ceiling, but it proved difficult to handle. Serial 108/17 was used to test the 118\u00a0kW (160\u00a0hp) Goebel Goe. III, while serial 469/17 was used to test the 108\u00a0kW (145\u00a0hp) Oberursel Ur. III. None of these engines were used on production aircraft. One triplane was used as a testbed for an experimental Schwade gear-driven supercharger.\nPostwar.\nThree triplanes are known to have survived the Armistice. Serial 528/17 was retained as a testbed by the \"Deutschen Versuchsanstalt f\u00fcr Luftfahrt\" (German Aviation Research Institute) at Adlershof. After being used in the filming of two movies, 528/17 is believed to have crashed sometime in the late 1930s. Serial 152/17, in which Manfred von Richthofen obtained three victories, was displayed at the \"Zeughaus\" museum in Berlin. This aircraft was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid during World War II.\nIn 1932, Fokker assembled a Dr.I from existing components. It was displayed in the \"Deutsche Luftfahrt-Sammlung\" in Berlin. In 1943, the aircraft was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid. Today, only a few original Dr.I artifacts survive in museums.\nReplica and reproduction aircraft.\nLarge numbers of replica and reproduction aircraft have been built for both individuals and museums. Bitz Flugzeugbau GmbH built two Dr.I replicas, serial numbers 001 and 002, for use in Twentieth Century Fox\u2019s 1966 film \"The Blue Max\". Replica 001 EI-APW is the oldest surviving example of the Dr.1. Because of the expense and scarcity of authentic rotary engines, most airworthy replicas are powered by a Warner Scarab or Continental R-670 radial engine. A few, however, feature vintage Le Rh\u00f4ne 9J or reproduction Oberursel Ur.II rotary engines.\nIn 2014, Iron Maiden lead singer Bruce Dickinson purchased replica G-CDXR.\nSpecifications (Dr.I).\n\"Data from\" \"Quest for Performance.\"General characteristics* Crew: 1* Aspect ratio: 4.04* Propellers: 2-bladed fixed-pitch wooden propeller\nPerformance* Endurance: * g limits: * Roll rate: * Lift-to-drag: 8:1\nArmament\nSee also.\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "51812", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51812", "title": "Amphora", "text": "Type of storage container\nAn amphora (; ; English pl.\u2009amphorae or amphoras) is a type of container with a pointed bottom and characteristic shape and size which fit tightly (and therefore safely) against each other in storage rooms and packages, tied together with rope and delivered by land or sea. The size and shape have been determined from at least as early as the Neolithic Period. Amphorae were used in vast numbers for the transport and storage of various products, both liquid and dry, but mostly for wine. They are most often ceramic, but examples in metals and other materials have been found. Versions of the amphorae were one of many shapes used in Ancient Greek vase painting.\nThe amphora complements a vase, the pithos, which makes available capacities between one-half and two and one-half tons. In contrast, the amphora holds under a half-ton, typically less than . The bodies of the two types have similar shapes. Where the pithos may have multiple small loops or lugs for fastening a rope harness, the amphora has two expansive handles joining the shoulder of the body and a long neck. The necks of pithoi are wide for scooping or bucket access. The necks of amphorae are narrow for pouring by a person holding it by the bottom and a handle. Some variants exist. The handles might not be present. The size may require two or three handlers to lift. For the most part, however, an amphora was tableware, or sat close to the table, was intended to be seen, and was finely decorated as such by master painters.\nStoppers of perishable materials, which have rarely survived, were used to seal the contents. Two principal types of amphorae existed: the \"neck amphora\", in which the neck and body meet at a sharp angle; and the \"one-piece amphora\", in which the neck and body form a continuous curve upwards. Neck amphorae were commonly used in the early history of ancient Greece, but were gradually replaced by the one-piece type from around the 7th century BC onward.\nMost were produced with a pointed base to allow upright storage by embedding in soft ground, such as sand. The base facilitated transport by ship, where the amphorae were packed upright or on their sides in as many as five staggered layers.. If upright, the bases probably were held by some sort of rack, and ropes passed through their handles to prevent shifting or toppling during rough seas. Heather and reeds might be used as packing around the vases. Racks could be used in kitchens and shops. The base also concentrated deposits from liquids with suspended solid particles, such as olive oil and wines.\nAmphorae are of great use to maritime archaeologists, as they often indicate the age of a shipwreck and the geographic origin of the cargo. They are occasionally so well preserved that the original content is still present, providing information on foodstuffs and mercantile systems. Amphorae were too cheap and plentiful to return to their origin-point and so, when empty, they were broken up at their destination. At a breakage site in Rome, Testaccio, close to the Tiber, the fragments, later wetted with calcium hydroxide (calce viva), remained to create a hill now named Monte Testaccio, high and more than 1\u00a0kilometre in circumference.\nEtymology.\nAmphora is a Greco-Roman word developed in ancient Greek during the Bronze Age. The Romans acquired it during the Hellenization that occurred in the Roman Republic. Cato is the first known literary person to use it. The Romans turned the Greek form into a standard - a declension noun, \"amphora\", pl. \"amphorae\". The word and the vase were almost certainly introduced to Italy through the Greek settlements there, which traded extensively in Greek pottery.\nEven though the Etruscans imported, manufactured, and exported amphorae extensively in their wine industry, and other Greek vase names were Etruscanized, no Etruscan form of the word exists. There was perhaps an as yet unidentified native Etruscan word for the vase that pre-empted the adoption of \"amphora\".\nThe Latin word derived from the Greek \"amphoreus\" (), a shortened form of \"amphiphoreus\" (), a compound word combining \"amphi-\" (\"on both sides\", \"twain\") and \"phoreus\" (\"carrier\"), from \"pherein\" (\"to carry\"), referring to the vessel's two carrying handles on opposite sides. The amphora appears as , \"a-pi-po-re-we\", in the Linear B Bronze Age records of Knossos, , \"a-po-re-we\", at Mycenae, and the fragmentary \"]-re-we\" at Pylos, designated by Ideogram 209 , Bennett's AMPHORA, which has a number of scribal variants. The two spellings are transcriptions of amphiphor\u0113wes (plural) and amphor\u0113we (dual) in Mycenaean Greek from which it may be seen that the short form prevailed on the mainland. Homer uses the long form for metrical reasons, and Herodotus has the short form. Ventris and Chadwick's translation is \"carried on both sides.\"\nWeights and measures.\nAmphorae varied greatly in height. The largest stands as tall as high, while some were less than high - the smallest were called amphoriskoi (literally \"little amphorae\"). Most were around high.\nThere was a significant degree of standardisation in some variants; the wine amphora held a standard measure of about 39 litres (41 US qt), giving rise to the amphora quadrantal as a unit of measure in the Roman Empire. In all, approximately 66 distinct types of amphora have been identified.\nFurther, the term also stands for an ancient Roman unit of measurement for liquids. The volume of a Roman amphora () was about one cubic (foot), equivalent to .\nProduction.\nRoman amphorae were wheel-thrown terracotta containers. During the production process the body was made first and then left to dry partially. Then coils of clay were added to form the neck, the rim, and the handles. Once the amphora was complete, the maker then treated the interior with resin that would prevent permeation of stored liquids. The reconstruction of these stages of production is based primarily on the study of modern amphora production in some areas of the eastern Mediterranean.\nAmphorae often were marked with a variety of stamps, sgraffito, and inscriptions. They provided information on the production, content, and subsequent marketing. A stamp usually was applied to the amphora at a partially dry stage. It indicates the name of the \"figlina\" (workshop) and/or the name of the owner of the workshop. Painted stamps, \"tituli picti\", recorded the weight of the container and the contents, and were applied after the amphora was filled. Today, stamps are used to allow historians to track the flow of trade goods and recreate ancient trade networks.\nClassification.\nThe first systematic classification of Roman amphorae types was undertaken by the German scholar Heinrich Dressel. Following the exceptional amphora deposit uncovered in Rome in Castro Pretorio at the end of the 1800s, he collected almost 200 inscriptions from amphorae and included them in the \"Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum\". In his studies of the amphora deposit he was the first to elaborate a classification of types, the so-called \"Dressel table\", which still is used today for many types.\nSubsequent studies on Roman amphorae have produced more detailed classifications, which usually are named after the scholar who studied them. For the neo-Phoenician types see the work by Ma\u00f1a published in 1951, and the revised classification by Van der Werff in 1977\u20131978. The Gallic amphorae have been studied by Laubenheimer in a study published in 1989, whereas the Cretan amphorae have been analyzed by Marangou-Lerat. Beltr\u00e0n studied the Spanish types in 1970. Adriatic types have been studied by Lamboglia in 1955. For a general analysis of the Western Mediterranean types see Panella, and Peacock and Williams.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric origins.\nCeramics of shapes and uses falling within the range of amphorae, with or without handles, are of prehistoric heritage across Eurasia, from the Caucasus to China. Amphorae dated to approximately 4800 BC have been found in Banpo, a Neolithic site of the Yangshao culture in China. Amphorae first appeared on the Phoenician coast at approximately 3500 BC.\nIn the Bronze and Iron Ages amphorae spread around the ancient Mediterranean world, being used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as the principal means for transporting and storing grapes, olive oil, wine, oil, olives, grain, fish, and other agricultural products. They were produced on an industrial scale until approximately the 7th century AD. Wooden and skin containers seem to have supplanted amphorae thereafter.\nThey influenced Chinese ceramics and other East Asian ceramic cultures, especially as a fancy shape for high-quality decorative ceramics, and continued to be produced there long after they had ceased to be used further west.\nAncient Greece: fancy shapes for painting.\nBesides coarse amphorae used for storage and transport, the vast majority, high-quality painted amphorae were produced in Ancient Greece in significant numbers for a variety of social and ceremonial purposes. Their design differs vastly from the more functional versions; they are typified by wide mouth and a ring base, with a glazed surface and decorated with figures or geometric shapes. They normally have a firm base on which they can stand. Panathenaic amphorae were used as prizes in the Panathenaic Festivals held between the 6th century BC to the 2nd century BC, filled with olive oil from a sacred grove. Surviving examples bear the inscription \"I am one of the prizes from Athens\", and usually depict the particular event they were awarded for.\nPainted amphorae were also used for funerary purposes, often in special types such as the \"loutrophoros\". Especially in earlier periods, outsize vases were used as grave markers, while some amphorae were used as containers for the ashes of the dead. By the Roman period vase-painting had largely died out, and utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.\nGreek amphora types.\nVarious different types of amphorae were popular at different times:\nNeck amphora (c. 6th\u20135th century BC).\nOn a neck amphora, the handles are attached to the neck, which is separated from the belly by an angular carination. There are two main types of neck amphorae:\nThere are also some rarer special types of neck amphora, distinguished by specific features, for example:\nBelly amphora (c. 640\u2013450 BC).\nIn contrast to the neck amphora, a belly amphora does not have a distinguished neck; instead, the belly reaches the mouth in a continuous curve. After the mid-5th century BC, this type was rarely produced. The \"pelike\" is a special type of belly amphora, with the belly placed lower, so that the widest point of the vessel is near its bottom. The \"pelike\" was introduced around the end of the 6th century BC.\nPanathenaic prize amphora.\nAnother special type is the Panathenaic prize amphora, with black-figure decoration, produced exclusively as prize vessels for the Panathenaia and retaining the black-figure technique for centuries after the introduction of red-figure vase painting. Some examples bear the inscription \"\u03a4\u03a9\u039d \u0391\u0398\u0397\u039d\u0397\u0398\u0395\u039d \u0391\u0398\u039b\u03a9\u039d\" meaning \"[I am one] of the prizes from [the goddess] Athena\". They contained the prize of oil from the sacred olive tree of the goddess Athena for the winners of the athletic contests held to honour the goddess, and were evidently kept thereafter, and perhaps used to store wine, before being buried with the prize-winner. They depicted goddess Athena on one side (as seen on the second image on this page) and the athletic event on the other side, e.g. a scene of wrestling or running contest etc.\nAncient Rome.\nBy the Roman period utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.\nThe first type of Roman amphora, Dressel 1, appears in central Italy in the late 2nd century BC. This type had thick walls and a characteristic red fabric. It was very heavy, although also strong. Around the middle of the 1st century BC the so-called Dressel 2-4 starts to become widely used. This type of amphora presented some advantages in being lighter and with thinner walls. It has been calculated that while a ship could accommodate approximately 4500 Dressel 1, it was possible to fit 6000 Dressel 2\u20134 in the same space. Dressel 2-4 were often produced in the same workshops used for the production of Dressel 1 which quickly ceased to be used.\nAt the same time in Cuma (southern Italy) the production of the \"cadii cumani\" type starts (Dressel 21\u201322). These containers were mainly used for the transportation of fruit and were used until the middle imperial times. At the same time, in central Italy, the so-called Spello amphorae, small containers, were produced for the transportation of wine. On the Adriatic coast the older types were replaced by the Lamboglia 2 type, a wine amphora commonly produced between the end of the 2nd and the 1st century BC. This type develops later into the Dressel 6A which becomes dominant during Augustan times.\nIn the Gallic provinces the first examples of Roman amphorae were local imitations of pre-existent types such as Dressel 1, Dressel 2\u20134, Pascual 1, and Haltern 70. The more typical Gallic production begins within the ceramic ateliers in Marseille during late Augustan times. The type Oberaden 74 was produced to such an extent that it influenced the production of some Italic types. Spanish amphorae became particularly popular thanks to a flourishing production phase in late Republican times. The \"Hispania Baetica\" and \"Hispania Tarraconensis\" regions (south-western and eastern Spain) were the main production areas between the 2nd and the 1st century BC due to the distribution of land to military veterans and the founding of new colonies. Spanish amphorae were widespread in the Mediterranean area during early imperial times. The most common types were all produced in Baetica and among these there were the Dressel 20, a typical olive oil container, the Dressel 7\u201313, for garum (fish sauce), and the Haltern 70, for defrutum (fruit sauce). In the Tarraconensis region the Pascual 1 was the most common type, a wine amphora shaped on the Dressel 1, and imitations of Dressel 2\u20134.\nNorth-African production was based on an ancient tradition which may be traced back to the Phoenician colony of Carthage. Phoenician amphorae had characteristic small handles attached directly onto the upper body. This feature becomes the distinctive mark of late-Republican/early imperial productions, which are then called neo-Phoenician. The types produced in Tripolitania and Northern Tunisia are the Ma\u00f1a C1 and C2, later renamed Van der Werff 1, 2, and 3. In the Aegean area the types from the island of Rhodes were quite popular starting from the 3rd century BC due to local wine production which flourished over a long period. These types developed into the \"Camulodunum\" 184, an amphora used for the transportation of Rhodian wine all over the empire. Imitations of the Dressel 2-4 were produced on the island of Cos for the transportation of wine from the 4th century BC until middle imperial times. Cretan containers also were popular for the transportation of wine and can be found around the Mediterranean from Augustan times until the 3rd century AD. During the late empire period, north-African types dominated amphora production. The so-called African I and II types were widely used from the 2nd until the late 4th century AD. Other types from the eastern Mediterranean (Gaza), such as the so-called Late Roman 4, became very popular between the 4th and the 7th century AD, while Italic productions ceased.\nThe largest known wreck of an amphorae cargo ship, carrying 6,000 pots, was discovered off the coast of Kefalonia, an Ionian island off the coast of Greece.\nModern use.\nSome modern winemakers and brewers use amphorae to provide a different palate and taste to their products from those that are available with other aging methods.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "51814", "revid": "50132161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51814", "title": "Sumo", "text": "Japanese martial art\n is a form of competitive full-contact wrestling where a \"rikishi\" (wrestler) attempts to force his opponent out of a circular ring (\"dohy\u014d\") or into touching the ground with any body part other than the soles of his feet (usually by throwing, shoving or pushing him down).\nSumo originated in Japan, the only country where it is practised professionally and where it is considered the national sport. It is considered a \"gendai bud\u014d\", which refers to modern Japanese martial arts, but the sport has a history spanning many centuries. Many ancient traditions have been preserved in sumo, and even today the sport includes many ritual elements, such as the use of salt purification, from Shinto.\nLife as a wrestler is highly regimented, with rules regulated by the Japan Sumo Association. Most sumo wrestlers are required to live in communal sumo training stables, known in Japanese as \"heya\", where all aspects of their daily lives\u00a0\u2013 from meals to their manner of dress\u00a0\u2013 are dictated by strict tradition. The lifestyle has a negative effect on their health, with sumo wrestlers having a much lower life expectancy than the average Japanese man.\nFrom 2008 to 2016, a number of high-profile controversies and scandals rocked the sumo world, with an associated effect on its reputation and ticket sales. These have also affected the sport's ability to attract recruits. Despite this setback, sumo's popularity and general attendance has rebounded due to having multiple \"yokozuna\" (or grand champions) for the first time in a number of years and other high-profile wrestlers grabbing the public's attention.\nEtymology.\nThe spoken word \"sum\u014d\" goes back to the verb \"sumau/sumafu\", meaning 'compete' or 'fight'. The written word goes back to the expression , which was a wrestling competition at the imperial court during the Heian period. The characters from \"sumai\", or \"sum\u014d\" today, mean 'to strike each other'. There are instances of \"sumo\" alternatively being written with the kanji \"\", as in the . Here, the first character means 'corner', but serves as a phonetic element, as one reading of it is \"sumi\", while the second character means 'force'.\n\"Sum\u014d\" is also a general term for wrestling in Japanese. For example, means 'arm wrestling', and means 'finger wrestling'. The professional sumo observed by the Japan Sumo Association is called , or 'grand sumo'.\nHistory.\nAntiquity (pre-1185).\nPrehistoric wall paintings indicate that sumo originated from an agricultural ritual dance performed in prayer for a good harvest. The first mention of sumo can be found in a \"Kojiki\" manuscript dating back to 712, which describes how possession of the Japanese islands was decided in a wrestling match between the \"kami\" known as Takemikazuchi and Takeminakata.\nTakemikazuchi was a god of thunder, swordsmanship, and conquest, created from the blood that was shed when Izanagi slew the fire-demon Kagu-tsuchi. Takeminakata was a god of water, wind, agriculture and hunting, and a distant descendant of the storm-god Susanoo. When Takemikazuchi sought to conquer the land of Izumo, Takeminakata challenged him in hand-to-hand combat. In their melee, Takemikazuchi grappled Takeminakata's arm and crushed it \"like a reed\", defeating Takeminakata and claiming Izumo.\nThe , published in 720, dates the first sumo match between mortals to the year 23\u00a0BC, when a man named Nomi no Sukune fought against Taima no Kuehaya at the request of Emperor Suinin and eventually killed him, making him the mythological ancestor of sumo. According to the \"Nihon Shoki\", Nomi broke a rib of Taima with one kick, and killed him with a kick to the back as well. Until the Japanese Middle Ages, this unregulated form of wrestling was often fought to the death of one of the fighters. In the Kofun period (300\u2013538), \"Haniwa\" of sumo wrestlers were made. The first historically attested sumo fights were held in 642 at the court of Empress K\u014dgyoku to entertain a Korean legation. In the centuries that followed, the popularity of sumo within the court increased its ceremonial and religious significance. Regular events at the Emperor's court, the , and the establishment of the first set of rules for sumo fall into the cultural heyday of the Heian period.\nJapanese Middle Ages (1185\u20131603).\nWith the collapse of the Emperor's central authority, sumo lost its importance in the court; during the Kamakura period, sumo was repurposed from a ceremonial struggle to a form of military combat training among \"samurai\". By the Muromachi period, sumo had fully left the seclusion of the court and became a popular event for the masses, and among the \"daimy\u014d\" it became common to sponsor wrestlers. \"Sumotori\" who successfully fought for a \"daimy\u014d\"'s favor were given generous support and \"samurai\" status. Oda Nobunaga, a particularly avid fan of the sport, held a tournament of 1,500 wrestlers in February 1578. Because several bouts were to be held simultaneously within Oda Nobunaga's castle, circular arenas were delimited to hasten the proceedings and to maintain the safety of the spectators. This event marks the invention of the \"dohy\u014d\", which would be developed into its current form up until the 18th century. The winner of Nobunaga's tournament was given a bow for being victorious and he began dancing to show the war-lord his gratitude.\nEdo period (1603\u20131867).\nBecause sumo had become a nuisance due to wild fighting on the streets, particularly in Edo, sumo was temporarily banned in the city during the Edo period. In 1684, sumo was permitted to be held for charity events on the property of Shinto shrines, as was common in Kyoto and Osaka. The first sanctioned tournament took place in the Tomioka Hachiman Shrine at this time. An official sumo organization was developed, consisting of professional wrestlers at the disposal of the Edo administration. Many elements date from this period, such as the \"dohy\u014d-iri\", the \"heya\" system, the \"gy\u014dji\" and the \"mawashi\". The 18th century brought forth several notable wrestlers such as Raiden Tameemon, Onogawa Kisabur\u014d and Tanikaze Kajinosuke, the first historical \"yokozuna\".\nWhen Matthew C. Perry was shown sumo wrestling during his 1853 expedition to Japan, he found it distasteful and arranged a military showcase to display the merits of Western organization.\nSince 1868.\nThe Meiji Restoration of 1868 brought about the end of the feudal system, and with it the wealthy \"daimy\u014d\" as sponsors. Due to a new fixation on Western culture, sumo had come to be seen as an embarrassing and backward relic, and internal disputes split the central association. The popularity of sumo was restored when Emperor Meiji organized a tournament in 1884; his example would make sumo a national symbol and contribute to nationalist sentiment following military successes against Korea and China. The Japan Sumo Association reunited on 28 December 1925 and increased the number of annual tournaments from two to four, and then to six in 1958. The length of tournaments was extended from ten to fifteen days in 1949.\nRules and customs.\nThe elementary principle of sumo is that a match is decided by a fighter first either being forced out of the circular \"dohy\u014d\" (ring) (not necessarily having to touch the ground outside the ring with any part of the body), or touching the ground inside the ring with any part of the body other than the soles of the feet. The wrestlers try to achieve this by pushing, tossing, striking and often by outwitting the opponent. The Japan Sumo Association currently distinguishes 82 \"kimarite\" (winning techniques), some of which come from judo. The most common basic forms are grabbing the opponent by the \"mawashi\" (belt) and then forcing him out, a style called , or pushing the opponent out of the ring without a firm grip, a style called . Illegal moves are called \"kinjite\", which include strangulation, hair-pulling, bending fingers, gripping the crotch area, kicking, poking eyes, punching and simultaneously striking both the opponent's ears.\nThe \"dohy\u014d\", which is constructed and maintained by the \"yobidashi\", consists of a raised pedestal on which a circle 15 shaku ( ) in diameter is delimited by a series of rice-straw bales. In the middle of the circle there are two starting lines (\"shikiri-sen\"), behind which the wrestlers line up for the \"tachi-ai\", the synchronized charge that initiates the match. The direction of the match is incumbent on the \"gy\u014dji\", a referee who is supported by five \"shimpan\" (judges). In some situations, a review of the \"gy\u014dji\"'s decision may be needed. The \"shimpan\" may convene a conference in the middle of the ring, called a \"mono-ii\". This is done if the judges decide that the decision over who won the bout needs to be reviewed; for example, if both wrestlers appear to touch the ground or step out of the ring at the same time. In these cases, sometimes video is reviewed to see what happened. Once a decision is made, the chief judge will announce the decision to the spectators and the wrestlers alike. They may order a bout to be restarted, or leave the decision as given by the \"gy\u014dji\". Occasionally the \"shimpan\" will overrule the \"gy\u014dji\" and give the bout to the other wrestler. On rare occasions the referee or judges may award the win to the wrestler who touched the ground first. This happens if both wrestlers touch the ground at nearly the same time and it is decided that the wrestler who touched the ground second had no chance of winning, his opponent's superior \"sumo\" having put him in an irrecoverable position. The losing wrestler is referred to as being \"shini-tai\" (\"dead body\") in this case.\nThe maximum length of a match varies depending on the division. In the top division, the limit is four minutes, although matches usually only last a few seconds. If the match has not yet ended after the allotted time has elapsed, a \"mizu-iri\" (water break) is taken, after which the wrestlers continue the fight from their previous positions. If a winner is still not found after another four minutes, the fight restarts from the \"tachi-ai\" after another \"mizu-iri\". If this still does not result in a decision, the outcome is considered a \"hikiwake\" (draw). This is an extremely rare result, with the last such draw being called in September 1974.\nA special attraction of sumo is the variety of observed ceremonies and rituals, some of which have been cultivated in connection with the sport and unchanged for centuries. These include the ring-entering ceremonies (\"dohy\u014d-iri\") at the beginning of each tournament day, in which the wrestlers appear in the ring in elaborate \"kesho-mawashi\", but also such details as the tossing of salt into the ring by the wrestlers, which serves as a symbolic cleansing of the ring, and rinsing the mouth with before a fight, which is similar to the ritual before entering a Shinto shrine. Additionally, before a match begins the two wrestlers perform and repeat a warm up routine called \"shikiri\". The top division is given four minutes for \"shikiri\", while the second division is given three, after which the timekeeping judge signals to the \"gy\u014dji\" that time is up.\nTraditionally, sumo wrestlers are renowned for their great girth and body mass, which is often a winning factor in sumo. No weight divisions are used in professional sumo; a wrestler can sometimes face an opponent twice his own weight. However, with superior technique, smaller wrestlers can control and defeat much larger opponents. The average weight of top division wrestlers has continued to increase, from in 1969 to over by 1991, and was a record as of January 2019.\nProfessional sumo.\nProfessional sumo is organized by the Japan Sumo Association. It is called \u014czum\u014d (\u5927\u76f8\u64b2, Grand Sumo). The members of the association, called \"oyakata\", are all former wrestlers, and are the only people entitled to train new wrestlers. All professional wrestlers must be a member of a training stable (or \"heya\") run by one of the \"oyakata\", who is the stablemaster for the wrestlers under him. In 2007, 43 training stables hosted 660 wrestlers.\nTo turn professional, wrestlers must have completed at least nine years of compulsory education and meet minimum height and weight requirements. In 1994, the Japanese Sumo Association required that all sumo wrestlers be a minimum in height. This prompted 16-year-old Takeji Harada of Japan (who had failed six previous eligibility tests) to have four separate cosmetic surgeries over a period of 12 months to add an extra of silicone to his scalp, which created a large, protruding bulge on his head. In response to this, the JSA stated that they would no longer accept aspiring wrestlers who surgically enhanced their height, citing health concerns. In 2019, \"The Japan Times\" reported that the height requirement was , and the weight requirement was , although they also claimed that a \"blind eye\" is turned for those \"just shy\" of the minimums. In 2023 the Sumo Association loosened the height and weight requirements, announcing that prospective recruits not meeting the minimums could still enter sumo by passing a physical fitness exam.\nAll sumo wrestlers take wrestling names called , which may or may not be related to their real names. Often, wrestlers have little choice in their names, which are given to them by their stablemasters, or by a supporter or family member who encouraged them into the sport. This is particularly true of foreign-born wrestlers. A wrestler may change his wrestling name during his career, with some changing theirs several times.\nProfessional sumo wrestling has a strict hierarchy based on sporting merit. The wrestlers are ranked according to a system that dates back to the Edo period. They are promoted or demoted according to their performance in six official tournaments held throughout the year, which are called \"honbasho\". A carefully prepared \"banzuke\" listing the full hierarchy is published two weeks prior to each sumo tournament.\nIn addition to the professional tournaments, exhibition competitions are held at regular intervals every year in Japan, and roughly once every two years, the top-ranked wrestlers visit a foreign country for such exhibitions. None of these displays are taken into account in determining a wrestler's future rank. Rank is determined only by performance in grand sumo tournaments.\nSumo divisions.\nThe six divisions in sumo, in descending order of prestige, are:\nWrestlers enter sumo in the lowest \"jonokuchi\" division and, ability permitting, work their way up to the top division. A broad demarcation in the sumo world can be seen between the wrestlers in the top two divisions known as and those in the four lower divisions, known commonly by the more generic term . The ranks receive different levels of compensation, privileges, and status.\nThe topmost \"makuuchi\" division receives the most attention from fans and has the most complex hierarchy. The majority of wrestlers are and are ranked from the highest level 1 down to about 16 or 17. In each rank are two wrestlers; the higher rank is designated as \"east\" and the lower as \"west\", so the list goes #1 east, #1 west, #2 east, #2 west, etc. Above the \"maegashira\" are the three champion or titleholder ranks, called the \"san'yaku\", which are only numbered if the number of wrestlers in each rank exceeds two. These are, in ascending order, , , and . At the pinnacle of the ranking system is the rank of .\n\"Yokozuna\", or grand champions, are generally expected to compete for and to win the top division tournament title on a regular basis, hence the promotion criteria for \"yokozuna\" are very strict. In general, an \"\u014dzeki\" must win the championship for two consecutive tournaments or an \"equivalent performance\" to be considered for promotion to \"yokozuna\". More than one wrestler can hold the rank of \"yokozuna\" at the same time.\nIn antiquity, sumo was solely a Japanese sport. Since the 1900s, however, the number of foreign-born sumo wrestlers has gradually increased. In the beginning of this period, these few foreign wrestlers were listed as Japanese, but particularly since the 1960s, a number of high-profile foreign-born wrestlers became well-known, and in more recent years have even come to dominate in the highest ranks. In the 10 years since January 2009, five of the nine wrestlers promoted to \"\u014dzeki\" have been foreign-born, and a Japanese had not been named \"yokozuna\" from 1998 until the promotion of Kisenosato Yutaka in 2017. This and other issues eventually led the Sumo Association to limit the number of foreigners allowed to one in each stable.\nWomen and sumo.\nWomen are not allowed to compete in professional sumo. They are also not allowed to enter the wrestling ring (\"dohy\u014d\"), a tradition stemming from Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that women are \"impure\" because of menstrual blood.\nA form of existed in some parts of Japan before professional sumo was established. The 2018 film \"The Chrysanthemum and the Guillotine\" depicts female sumo wrestlers at the time of civil unrest following the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake.\nProfessional sumo tournaments.\nSince 1958, six Grand Sumo tournaments or \"honbasho\" have been held each year: three at the Kokugikan in Tokyo (January, May, and September), and one each in Osaka (March), Nagoya (July), and Fukuoka (November). Until the end of 1984, the Kokugikan was located in Kuramae, Tokyo, but moved in 1985 to the newly built venue at Ry\u014dgoku. Each tournament begins on a Sunday and runs for 15 days, ending also on a Sunday, roughly in the middle of the month. The tournaments are organized in a manner akin to a McMahon system tournament; each wrestler in the top two divisions (\"sekitori\") has one match per day, while the lower-ranked wrestlers compete in seven bouts, about one every two days.\nEach day is structured so that the highest-ranked contestants compete at the end of the day. Thus, wrestling starts in the morning with the \"jonokuchi\" wrestlers and ends at around six o'clock in the evening with bouts involving the \"yokozuna\". The wrestler who wins the most matches over the 15 days wins the tournament championship (\"y\u016bsh\u014d\") for his division. If two wrestlers are tied for the top, they wrestle each other and the winner takes the title. Three-way ties for a championship are rare, at least in the top division. In these cases, the three wrestle each other in pairs with the first to win two in a row taking the tournament. More complex systems for championship playoffs involving four or more wrestlers also exist, but these are usually only seen in determining the winner of one of the lower divisions.\nThe matchups for each day of the tournament are determined by the sumo elders who are members of the judging division of the Japan Sumo Association. They meet every morning at 11 am and announce the following day's matchups around 12\u00a0pm. An exception are the final day 15 matchups, which are announced much later on day 14. Each wrestler only competes against a selection of opponents from the same division, though small overlaps can occur between two divisions. The first bouts of a tournament tend to be between wrestlers who are within a few ranks of each other. Afterwards, the selection of opponents takes into account a wrestler's prior performance. For example, in the lower divisions, wrestlers with the same record in a tournament are generally matched up with each other and the last matchups often involve undefeated wrestlers competing against each other, even if they are from opposite ends of the division. In the top division, in the last few days, wrestlers with exceptional records often have matches against much more highly ranked opponents, including \"san'yaku\" wrestlers, especially if they are still in the running for the top division championship. Similarly, more highly ranked wrestlers with very poor records may find themselves fighting wrestlers much further down the division.\nFor the \"yokozuna\" and \"\u014dzeki\", the first week and a half of the tournament tends to be taken up with bouts against the top \"maegashira\", \"komusubi\", and \"sekiwake\", with the bouts within these ranks being concentrated into the last five days or so of the tournament (depending on the number of top-ranked wrestlers competing). Traditionally, on the final day, the last three bouts of the tournament are between the top six ranked wrestlers, with the top two competing in the final matchup, unless injuries during the tournament prevent this.\nCertain match-ups are prohibited in regular tournament play. Wrestlers who are from the same training stable cannot compete against each other, nor can wrestlers who are brothers, even if they join different stables. The one exception to this rule is that training stable partners and brothers can face each other in a championship-deciding playoff match.\nThe last day of the tournament is called \"sensh\u016braku\", which literally means \"the pleasure of a thousand autumns\". This colorful name for the culmination of the tournament echoes the words of the playwright Zeami to represent the excitement of the decisive bouts and the celebration of the victor. The Emperor's Cup is presented to the wrestler who wins the top-division \"makuuchi\" championship. Numerous other (mostly sponsored) prizes are also awarded to him. These prizes are often rather elaborate, ornate gifts, such as giant cups, decorative plates, and statuettes. Others are quite commercial, such as one trophy shaped like a giant Coca-Cola bottle.\nPromotion and relegation for the next tournament are determined by a wrestler's score over the 15 days. In the top division, the term \"kachikoshi\" means a score of 8\u20137 or better, as opposed to \"makekoshi\", which indicates a score of 7\u20138 or worse. A wrestler who achieves \"kachikoshi\" almost always is promoted further up the ladder, the level of promotion being higher for better scores. See the \"makuuchi\" article for more details on promotion and relegation.\nA top-division wrestler who is not an \"\u014dzeki\" or \"yokozuna\" and who finishes the tournament with \"kachikoshi\" is also eligible to be considered for one of the three prizes awarded for \"technique\", \"fighting spirit\", and defeating the most \"yokozuna\" and \"\u014dzeki\" the \"outstanding performance\" prize. For more information see \"sansh\u014d\".\nFor the list of upper divisions champions since 1909, refer to the list of top division champions and the list of second division champions.\nA professional sumo bout.\nAt the initial charge, both wrestlers must jump up from the crouch simultaneously after touching the surface of the ring with two fists at the start of the bout. The referee (\"gy\u014dji\") can restart the bout if this simultaneous touch does not occur.\nUpon completion of the bout, the referee must immediately designate his decision by pointing his \"gunbai\" or war-fan towards the winning side. The winning technique (\"kimarite\") used by the winner would then be announced to the audience. The wrestlers then return to their starting positions and bow to each other before retiring.\nThe referee's decision is not final and may be disputed by the five judges seated around the ring. If this happens, they meet in the center of the ring to hold a \"mono-ii\" (a talk about things). After reaching a consensus, they can uphold or reverse the referee's decision or order a rematch, known as a \"torinaoshi\".\nA winning wrestler in the top division may receive additional prize money in envelopes from the referee if the matchup has been sponsored. If a \"yokozuna \"is defeated by a lower-ranked wrestler, it is common and expected for audience members to throw their seat cushions into the ring (and onto the wrestlers), though this practice is technically prohibited.\nIn contrast to the time in bout preparation, bouts are typically very short, usually less than a minute (most of the time only a few seconds). Extremely rarely, a bout can go on for several minutes.\nControversies.\nControversies in professional sumo include match-fixing, gambling and yakuza ties, hazing, and the negative health effects of excessive body weight.\nExhibition.\nExhibition tournaments are occasionally held inside and outside Japan. Such as in 1991 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which Hokutoumi Nobuyoshi won. A return appearance is currently scheduled for October 17, 2025.\nLife as a professional sumo wrestler.\nA professional sumo wrestler leads a highly regimented way of life. The Sumo Association prescribes the behavior of its wrestlers in some detail. For example, the association prohibits wrestlers from driving cars, although this is partly out of necessity as many wrestlers are too big to fit behind a steering wheel. Breaking the rules can result in fines and/or suspension for both the offending wrestler and his stablemaster.\nOn entering sumo, they are expected to grow their hair long to form a topknot, or \"chonmage\", similar to the \"samurai\" hairstyles of the Edo period. Furthermore, they are expected to wear the \"chonmage\" and traditional Japanese dress when in public, allowing them to be identified immediately as wrestlers. In recent years, however, this rule has been enforced less strictly than before. The type and quality of the dress depends on the wrestler's rank. \"Rikishi\" in \"jonidan\" and below are allowed to wear only a thin cotton robe called a \"yukata\", even in winter. Furthermore, when outside, they must wear a form of wooden sandal called \"geta\". Wrestlers in the \"makushita\" and \"sandanme\" divisions can wear a form of traditional short overcoat over their \"yukata\" and are allowed to wear straw sandals, called \"z\u014dri\". The higher-ranked \"sekitori\" can wear silk robes of their own choice, and the quality of the garb is significantly improved. They also are expected to wear a more elaborate form of topknot called an \"\u014dich\u014d\" (big ginkgo leaf) on formal occasions.\nSimilar distinctions are made in stable life. The junior wrestlers must get up earliest, around 5\u00a0am, for training, whereas the \"sekitori\" may start around 7\u00a0am. When the \"sekitori\" are training, the junior wrestlers may have chores to do, such as assisting in cooking lunch, cleaning, and preparing baths, holding a \"sekitori\"'s towel, or wiping the sweat from him. The ranking hierarchy is preserved for the order of precedence in bathing after training, and in eating lunch.\nWrestlers are not normally allowed to eat breakfast and are expected to have a \"siesta\"-like nap after a large lunch. The most common type of lunch served is the traditional sumo meal of \"chankonabe\", which consists of a simmering stew of various meat and vegetables cooked at the table, and usually eaten with rice. This regimen of no breakfast and a large lunch followed by a sleep is intended to help wrestlers put on a lot of weight so as to compete more effectively. Sumo wrestlers also drink large amounts of beer.\nIn the afternoon, the junior wrestlers again usually have cleaning or other chores, while their \"sekitori\" counterparts may relax, or deal with work issues related to their fan clubs. Younger wrestlers also attend classes, although their education differs from the typical curriculum of their non-sumo peers. In the evening, \"sekitori\" may go out with their sponsors, while the junior wrestlers generally stay at home in the stable, unless they are to accompany the stablemaster or a \"sekitori\" as his \"tsukebito\" (manservant) when he is out. Becoming a \"tsukebito\" for a senior member of the stable is a typical duty. A \"sekitori\" has a number of \"tsukebito\", depending on the size of the stable or in some cases depending on the size of the \"sekitori\". The junior wrestlers are given the most mundane tasks such as cleaning the stable, running errands, and even washing or massaging the exceptionally large \"sekitori\" while only the senior \"tsukebito\" accompany the \"sekitori\" when he goes out.\nThe \"sekitori\" are given their own room in the stable, or may live in their own apartments, as do married wrestlers; the junior wrestlers sleep in communal dormitories. Thus, the world of the sumo wrestler is split broadly between the junior wrestlers, who serve, and the \"sekitori\", who are served. Life is especially harsh for recruits, to whom the worst jobs tend to be allocated, and the dropout rate at this stage is high.\nThe negative health effects of the sumo lifestyle can become apparent later in life. Sumo wrestlers have a life expectancy of 65, which is about 15 years shorter than that of the average Japanese male, as the diet and sport take a toll on the wrestler's body. Those having a higher body mass are at greater risk of death. Many develop type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure, and they are prone to heart attacks due to the enormous amount of body mass and fat that they accumulate. The excessive intake of alcohol can lead to liver problems, and the stress on their joints due to their excess weight can cause arthritis. The repeated blows to the head sumo wrestlers take can also cause long-term cognitive issues, similar to those seen in boxers. In the 21st century, the standards of weight gain became less strict for the sake of the wrestlers' health.\nSalary and payment.\nAs of 2018[ [update]], the monthly salary figures (in Japanese yen) for the top two divisions were:\nWrestlers lower than the second-highest division, who are considered trainees, receive only a fairly small allowance instead of a salary.\nIn addition to the basic salary, \"sekitori\" wrestlers also receive additional bonus income, called \"mochiky\u016bkin\", six times a year (once every tournament, or \"basho\") based on the cumulative performance in their career to date. This bonus increases every time the wrestler scores a \"kachikoshi\" (with larger \"kachikoshi\" giving larger raises). Special increases in this bonus are also awarded for winning the top division championship (with an extra large increase for a \"perfect\" championship victory with no losses or \"zensh\u014d-y\u016bsh\u014d\"), and also for scoring a gold star or \"kinboshi\" (an upset of a \"yokozuna\" by a \"maegashira\").\n\"San'yaku\" wrestlers also receive a relatively small additional tournament allowance, depending on their rank, and \"yokozuna\" receive an additional allowance every second tournament, associated with the making of a new \"tsuna\" belt worn in their ring entering ceremony.\nAlso, prize money is given to the winner of each divisional championship, which increases from \u00a5100,000 for a \"jonokuchi\" victory up to \u00a510 million for winning the top division. In addition to prizes for a championship, wrestlers in the top division giving an exceptional performance in the eyes of a judging panel can also receive one or more of three special prizes (the \"sansh\u014d\"), which are worth \u00a52 million each.\nIndividual top division matches can also be sponsored by companies, with the resulting prize money called \"kensh\u014dkin\". For bouts involving \"yokozuna\" and \"\u014dzeki\", the number of sponsors can be quite large, whereas for lower-ranked matchups, no bout sponsors may be active at all unless one of the wrestlers is particularly popular, or unless a company has a policy of sponsoring all his matchups. As of 2019[ [update]], a single sponsorship cost \u00a570,000, with \u00a560,000 going to the winner of the bout and \u00a510,000 deducted by the Japan Sumo Association for costs and fees. Immediately after the match, the winner receives an envelope from the referee with half of his share of the sponsorship, while the other half is put in a fund for his retirement. No prize money is awarded for bouts decided by a \"fusensh\u014d\" or forfeit victory.\nAmateur sumo.\nJapan.\nSumo is also practised as an amateur sport in Japan, with participants in college, high school, grade school or company workers on works teams. Open amateur tournaments are also held. The sport at this level is stripped of most of the ceremony. Most new entries into professional sumo are junior high school graduates with little to no previous experience, but the number of wrestlers with a collegiate background in the sport has been increasing over the past few decades. \"The International Herald Tribune\" reported on this trend in November 1999, when more than a third of the wrestlers in the top two divisions were university graduates. Nippon Sport Science University and Nihon University are the colleges that have produced the most professional sumo wrestlers. The latter produced Hiroshi Wajima, who in 1973 became the first, and remains the only, wrestler with a collegiate background to attain the rank of \"yokozuna\".\nThe most successful amateur wrestlers (usually college champions) are allowed to enter professional sumo at \"makushita\" (third division) or \"sandanme\" (fourth division) rather than from the very bottom of the ladder. These ranks are called \"makushita tsukedashi\" and \"sandanme tsukedashi\", and are currently equivalent to \"makushita\" 10, \"makushita\" 15, or \"sandanme\" 100 depending on the level of amateur success achieved. All amateur athletes entering the professional ranks must be under 23 to satisfy the entry, except those who qualify for \"makushita tsukedashi\" or \"sandanme tsukedashi\", who may be up to 25.\nOutside Japan.\nAmateur sumo clubs are gaining in popularity in the United States, with competitions regularly being held in major cities across the country. The US Sumo Open, for example, was held in the Los Angeles Convention Center in 2007 with an audience of 3,000. The sport has long been popular on the West Coast and in Hawaii, where it has played a part in the festivals of the Japanese ethnic communities. Now, however, the sport has grown beyond the sphere of Japanese diaspora and athletes come from a variety of ethnic, cultural, and sporting backgrounds.\nAmateur sumo is particularly strong in Europe. Many athletes come to the sport from a background in judo, freestyle wrestling, or other grappling sports such as sambo. Some Eastern European athletes have been successful enough to be scouted into professional sumo in Japan, much like their Japanese amateur counterparts. The most notable of these to date is the Bulgarian Koto\u014dsh\u016b, who is the highest-ranking foreign wrestler who was formerly an amateur sumo athlete.\nBrazil is another center of amateur sumo, introduced by Japanese immigrants who arrived during the first half of the twentieth century. The first Brazilian sumo tournament was held in 1914. Sumo took root in immigrant centers in southern Brazil, especially S\u00e3o Paulo, which is now home to the only purpose-built sumo training facility outside Japan. Beginning in the 1990s, Brazilian sumo organizations made an effort to interest Brazilians without Japanese ancestry in the sport, and by the mid-2000s an estimated 70% of participants came from outside the Japanese-Brazilian community. Brazil is also a center for women's sumo. A small number of Brazilian wrestlers have made the transition to professional sumo in Japan, including Ry\u016bk\u014d G\u014d and Kaisei Ichir\u014d.\nIn the UK, as early as 1985 a national Sumo Federation existed. Olympic Judoka Syd Hoare was fundamental to initial growth including taking a British team to Japan for first time.\nTwo national governing bodies existed for a brief time (British Sumo Federation and British Sumo Union), with a new organisation; https:// becoming the recognised national governing body in 2025.\nInternational competition.\nThe International Sumo Federation (IFS) was established in 1992 to encourage the sport's development worldwide, including holding international championships like the Sumo World Championships and European Sumo Championships. A key aim of the federation is to have sumo recognized as an Olympic sport. Accordingly, amateur tournaments are divided into weight classes (men: lightweight up to , middleweight up to , heavyweight over , and openweight (unrestricted entry), and include competitions for female wrestlers (lightweight up to , middleweight up to , heavyweight over , and openweight). Sumo was a feature of the World Games, an Olympics-recognized event for non-Olympic sports, from 2001 until 2022; it was removed from future World Games programs due to poor sportsmanship and organization. It has additionally been a feature of the World Combat Games since their inception in 2010.\nClothing.\nSumo wrestlers wear \"mawashi\", a 30-foot-long belt, that they tie in knots in the back. They have an official thickness and strength requirement. During matches, the wrestler will grab onto the other wrestler's \"mawashi\" and use it to help them make moves during a match. The \"mawashi\" they wear practicing versus in a tournament is essentially the same except for the material. The different \"mawashi\" that the wrestlers wear differentiate their rank. Top rated wrestlers wear different colors of silk \"mawashi\" during tournament, while lower rated wrestlers are limited to just black cotton.\nTheir hair is put in a topknot, and wax is used to get the hair to stay in shape. Wax is applied to sumo wrestlers' hair daily by sumo hairdressers (tokoyama). The topknot is a type of samurai hairstyle which was once popular in Japan during the Edo period. The topknot is hard for some foreigners' hair because their hair is not as coarse and straight as Japanese hair. Once a wrestler joins a stable, he is required to grow out his hair in order to form a topknot.\nOutside of tournaments and practices, in daily life, sumo wrestlers are required to wear traditional Japanese clothes. They must wear these traditional clothes all the time in public. What they can wear in public is also determined by rank. Lower rated wrestlers must wear a \"yukata\" at all times, even in winter, where higher rated wrestlers have more choice in what they wear.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

County, is located in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2020 United States census, its population was 588,261, an increase of just under 10% since 2010. Its county seat is Annapolis, which is also the capital of the state. The county is named for Anne Arundell (c.\u20091615/1616\u20131649), Lady Baltimore, a member of the Arundell family in Cornwall, England, and the wife of Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605\u20131675), founder and first lord proprietor of the colony Province of Maryland. The county is part of the Central Maryland region of the state. Anne Arundel County is included in the Washington\u2013Baltimore\u2013Arlington combined statistical area.\nHistory.\nThe county was named for Lady Anne Arundell (1615/1616\u20131649), the daughter of Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour, members of the ancient family of Arundells in Cornwall, England. She married Cecilius Calvert, second Lord Baltimore (1605\u20131675), and the first lord proprietor of the colony, Province of Maryland, in an arranged marriage contract in 1627 or 1628. Modern spelling adds an 'e' to her first name of \"Ann\" and removes the second 'L' from the family name of \"Arundell\", but the old traditional spelling of her name is still used in the title of the local historical society, the Ann Arundell County Historical Society.\nAnne Arundel County was originally part of St. Mary's County, the province's first erected county in the southern portion of the Province of Maryland, which had first been established by arriving settlers in 1634. In 1650, the year after Lady Ann Arundell's death, the county separated from St. Mary's and \"erected\" into its own jurisdiction and became the third of the 23 Maryland counties. It was composed of the hundreds of Town Neck, Middle Neck, Broad Neck, South River, West River, and Herring Creek. Between 1654 and 1658, the county was known as \"Providence\" by many of its early settlers.\nOn March 25, 1655, after the English Civil War, (1642\u20131651), in Europe, the Battle of the Severn, the first naval colonial battle ever fought in North America, was fought in Anne Arundel County on the Severn River between Puritan forces supporting the Commonwealth of England and forces loyal to Lord Proprietor Cecilius Calvert. The Commonwealth forces under Captain William Fuller were victorious.\nIn 1692, the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church, became the established church of the Province of Maryland through an Act of the General Assembly. Ten counties had been established in the colony, and those counties were divided into 30 parishes, with vestrymen appointed within each. Ann Arrundell County was divided into four parishes: Herring Creek, South River, Middle Neck, and Broad Neck.\nBetween 1694 and 1695, the provincial capital of Maryland was moved from St. Mary's City along the northern shore of the Potomac River across from the southern colonial border with the Province of Virginia in St. Mary's County farther north along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, midway in the colony to Annapolis in Anne Arundel County. Prior to the move, Annapolis was known as \"Providence\".\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, citizens of Anne Arundel County supported the Continental Army by providing troops for three regiments. The 3rd Maryland Regiment, the 4th Maryland Regiment, and the 6th Maryland Regiment were recruited in the county.\nDuring the War of 1812, one of the original six heavy frigates of the recently re-established United States Navy, U.S.S. \"Constitution\", sailed from Annapolis prior to its victorious engagement with the H.M.S. \"Guerriere\" of the British Royal Navy.\nOn May 22, 1830, the inaugural horse-drawn train of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad travelled the of the newly completed track from Mount Clare Station in southwestern Baltimore to Ellicott Mills (now Ellicott City), then in the Western or Howard District (now Howard County) of Anne Arundel County. This was the first regular railroad passenger service in the United States. In 1831, land west of the railroad was considered the Howard District of Anne Arundel County. In 1851, the Howard District was broken off to form Howard County, now the 21st county in Maryland (of 23).\nThe county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (29%) is covered by water. Anne Arundel County is located to the south of Baltimore.\nMost of the county's borders are defined by water. To the east lies the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, and numerous tidal tributaries of the bay indent the shoreline, the various rivers, creeks, streams, inlets forming prominent peninsulas, also known as \"necks\" (as further south in Virginia). The largest of these tributaries include (from north to south), the Magothy River, Severn River, South River, and the West River. Further south, the upper Patuxent River forms the border of Anne Arundel with Prince George's County to the west. Deep Run forms part of the northwestern border with Howard County, and Lyons Creek forms part of the southern border with Calvert County. The Patapsco River to the north is the border with Baltimore County, but the communities and areas of Brooklyn and Curtis Bay neighborhoods (and adjacent Fairfield, Wagner's Point [also known as East Brooklyn], Arundel Cove [off of Curtis Creek], and Hawkins Point), lying south of the Patapsco River were annexed from Anne Arundel County to Baltimore in the third major annexation of January 1919.\nAnne Arundel County originally included all of the land between the Patuxent River and the Patapsco River (mainstem and South Branch) upstream to their headwaters on Parr's Ridge. The northwestern section of this long tract later became Howard County, with the border between the two running very close to the Atlantic Seaboard fall line. As a result, Anne Arundel County lies almost entirely within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, while Howard County is almost entirely within the Piedmont province.\nElevations in Anne Arundel County range from sea level at the Chesapeake and tidal tributaries to about in western areas near the fall line. The terrain is mostly flat or gently rolling, but more dramatic banks and bluffs can be found where waterways cut through areas of higher elevation.\nWith the exception of the very limited extent of Piedmont underlain by Precambrian to early Paleozoic metamorphic rock, all of the county is underlain by thick deposits of gravel, sand, silt, and clay dating from the early Cretaceous to Holocene times. Most of these sediments are unconsolidated but include local formations of sandstone, especially in the Pasadena area.\nAdjacent counties and independent city.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nAnne Arundel County has a humid subtropical climate, with hot summers and cool winters. Annual precipitation averages around per year throughout the county, with a fairly even distribution throughout the year. Annual snowfall totals around on average at BWI Airport, which has an elevation of above sea level. Slightly colder winter temperatures and higher snowfall are experienced at the higher elevations, with slightly lower snowfall closer to sea level. According to the most recent USDA Hardiness zone maps, the lowland areas of the county fall into Zone 8a, with an expected annual minimum temperatures of , while higher elevation and inland areas fall into Zone 7b, with expected annual minima of .\nPolitics and government.\nAnne Arundel County has had a charter government since 1965. The government consists of a county executive and a seven-member county council. These members are elected in the same years Maryland conducts its gubernatorial and legislative elections, and may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms.\nThe Democrats have the most registered voters in the county, but the large number of Republican-leaning independents means Republicans win more county-wide elections than in other mostly suburban counties in Maryland, but Democrats are the dominant party in Annapolis city elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Anne Arundel County voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by 6,016 votes. It was the first time that the county had supported a Democrat for president since 1964. Four years later, Joe Biden won the county by nearly 15%, the largest margin of victory for a Democrat in the county since the landslide election of Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 presidential election.\nAnne Arundel County is one of six \"reverse pivot counties\", counties that voted Republican in 2008 and 2012 before voting Democratic in 2016 onward.\nCounty Executives.\nThe county executive oversees the executive branch of the county government, which consists of a number of offices and departments. The executive branch is charged with implementing County law and overseeing the operation of the county government.\nCounty Council.\nThe County Council, as the legislative branch, adopts ordinances and resolutions, and has all of the county's legislative powers. The most recent county election occurred November 8, 2022.\nLaw enforcement.\nSeveral major law enforcement agencies serve Anne Arundel County:\nFederal representation.\nIn the 119th Congress, Anne Arundel County is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Sarah Elfreth (D) of the 3rd district, and Steny Hoyer (D) of the 5th district.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 United States census, 537,656 people, 199,378 households, and 139,262 families were residing in the county.

The Informix products were originally developed by Informix Corporation, whose Informix Software subsidiary was acquired by IBM in 2001.\nIn April 2017, IBM delegated active development and support to HCL Technologies for 15 years, with a number of IBM employees working on Informix also moving to HCL. As part of this arrangement IBM will continue to market and sell it as IBM Informix to their customers, with HCLTech able to market and sell it as HCL Informix.\nThe current version of Informix is 14.10 and forms the basis of several product editions with variation in capacity and functionality. The Informix database has been used in many high transaction rate OLTP applications in the retail, finance, energy and utilities, manufacturing and transportation sectors. More recently the server has been enhanced to improve its support for data warehouse workloads. Through extensions, Informix supports data types that are not a part of the SQL standard.\nOn July 24, 2020, HCL announced OneDB Database Server V1.0.0.0 as a multi-model (relational, object-relational, and dimensional) DBMS based on Informix. On August 19, 2021 HCL released OneDB 2.0 as a cloud native, multi-cloud, Kubernetes-orchestrated offering.\nOn December 29, 2021, Actian (formerly Ingres Corporation) became fully owned by HCL America. Actian remained a separate entity, now acting as the \"Data, Analytics and Insights\" division of HCLSoftware. It is expected that the Informix portfolio will be transferred from HCL to Actian, with HCL Informix and OneDB already available for download at Actian's Electronic Software Distribution (ESD) portal.\nKey products.\nAs of 2025, the current version of both IBM and HCL Informix is 15.0. The major enhancement in v15.0 over previous releases is the removal of most internal limits including limits on the number of rows per data page, the number of data pages in a table partition,availability of additional larger page sizes, and the total storage that can be managed by a single Informix instance. \nThe major enhancements made in v14.10 over previous releases were adding built-in index compression, integration of JSON collections with support for MongoDB JSON drivers into the server, and an enhancement permitting database objects to be partitioned across multiple servers in a cluster or grid (aka sharding). Queries can optionally return data from the locally connected server instance or from an entire grid with the same SQL.\nInformix version 14.10 introduced support for partial indexing where only a subset of the rows in a table are indexed and for multi-valued key indexes which support indexing the elements within multi-valued data types such as LIST, SET, MULTISET, and BSON array fields.\nHeterogeneous clusters are fully supported, and there are several deployment options that are available, including some that provide very high levels of data redundancy and fault tolerance. This feature is marketed by IBM as Informix Flexible Grid.\nIBM Informix is offered in a number of editions, including free developer editions, editions for small and mid-sized business, and editions supporting the complete feature set and designed to be used in support of the largest enterprise applications. There used to be an advanced data warehouse edition, including the Informix Warehouse Accelerator (IWA), but it was deprecated in favor of the Advanced Enterprise Edition (which give entitlement rights to IWA).\nRegarding HCL Informix, there is a single commercial version available, which is compatible with the IBM Informix Advanced Enterprise Edition, also having rights to IWA. There is also a trial version available, with no known limits, except for an expiration date.\nHCL Informix 14.10 key highlights include: \nPositioning.\nInformix is generally considered to be optimized for environments with very low or no database administration, including use as an embedded database. It has a long track record of supporting very high transaction rates and providing uptime characteristics needed for mission critical applications such as manufacturing lines and reservation systems. Informix has been widely deployed in the retail sector, where the low administration overhead makes it useful for in-store deployments.\nWith the ability to deeply embed Informix in gateways and routers, timeseries support, small footprint, and low administration requirements, Informix is also targeted at Internet-of-Things solutions, where many of the data-handling requirements can be handled with gateways that embed Informix and connect sensors and devices to the internet.\nOther products.\nIn addition to the products based on the version 15.0 engine the Informix family also includes a number of legacy database products which are still supported in market. These include Informix OnLine, Informix Standard Edition (SE), and Informix C-ISAM. These products are simpler and smaller footprint database engines that are also frequently embedded in third party applications. Collectively these products are often referred to as the \"Informix Classics\".\nThe Informix family also includes:\nObsolete and non-IBM Informix heritage products can run via emulation on modern hardware. \nTraining and certification.\nIBM Training includes a complete set of core Data Servers Training courses that apply to Informix. These courses delve into many essential Informix concepts, from fundamentals to advanced SQL topics.\nAs part of IBM's Academic Initiative, IBM is offering Informix software, documentation and training to higher education institutions worldwide through its new Informix on Campus program. IBM is offering an inclusive package of Informix materials to college faculty called \"Informix In a Box\", which offers hands-on labs and PowerPoints to use in lessons, recorded training for teachers, DVDs with class material and VMware virtual appliance images, as well as T-shirts for students.\nUsers groups.\nUsers groups remain active in Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, the United States, and many other countries. The IIUG (International Informix Users Group) acts as a federation of those user groups and provides numerous services to its members.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "51822", "revid": "10372357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51822", "title": "Allegheny River", "text": "River in Pennsylvania and New York, United States\nThe Allegheny River ( ; ; ) is a tributary of the Ohio River that is located in western Pennsylvania and New York in the United States. It runs from its headwaters just below the middle of Pennsylvania's northern border, northwesterly into New York, then in a zigzag southwesterly across the border and through Western Pennsylvania to join the Monongahela River at the Forks of the Ohio at Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nThe Allegheny River is, by volume, the main headstream of both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Historically, the Allegheny was considered to be the upper Ohio River by both Native Americans and European settlers.\nThis shallow river has been made navigable upstream from Pittsburgh to East Brady by a series of locks and dams that were constructed during the early 20th century. A 24-mile-long portion of the upper river in Warren and McKean counties of Pennsylvania and Cattaraugus County in New York forms the Allegheny Reservoir, which was created by the erection of the Kinzua Dam in 1965 for flood control.\nThe etymology behind the word \"Allegheny\" is of unclear pre-Columbian origin and may be derived from one of a number of Delaware/Unami phrases that are homophones of the English name, with varying translations.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Allegheny\" probably comes from Lenape \"welhik hane\" or \"oolikhanna,\" which means 'best flowing river of the hills' or 'beautiful stream'. There is a Lenape legend of a tribe called \"Talligewi\" who used to live along the river. Frederick Webb Hodge cited Henry Schoolcraft to connect the \"Talligewi\" to the Cherokee.\nThe following account of the origin of the name \"Allegheny\" was given in 1780 by Moravian missionary David Zeisberger: \"All this land and region, stretching as far as the creeks and waters that flow into the Alleghene the Delawares called Alligewinenk, which means 'a land into which they came from distant parts'. The river itself, however, is called Alligewi Sipo. The whites have made Alleghene out of this, the Six Nations calling the river the Ohio.\"\nThe Delaware Tribe of Indians gives the Lenape name as \"Alikehane\", \"river where footprints can be seen.\"\nNative Americans, including the Lenape and Iroquois, considered the Allegheny and Ohio rivers as the same, as is suggested by a New York State road sign on Interstate 86 that refers to the Allegheny River also as \"Ohi\u02d0yo\"'. The Geographic Names Information System lists \"O-hee-yo\" and \"O-hi-o\" as variant names. The river is called Ohi:'i:o` (river beautiful) in the Seneca language. In New York, areas around the river are often named with the alternate spelling \"Allegany\" in reference to the river; for example, the Village of Allegany and Allegany State Park. Port Allegany, located along the river in Pennsylvania near the border with New York, also follows this pattern.\nCourse.\nThe Allegheny River rises in north central Pennsylvania, on Cobb Hill in Allegany Township in north central Potter County, south of the New York\u2013Pennsylvania border and a few miles northwest of the eastern triple divide. The stream flows south and passes under Pennsylvania Route 49 11 miles northeast of Coudersport where a historical marker that declares the start of the river is located. Cobb Hill is about a mile north. The stream flows southwest paralleling Route 49 to Coudersport.\nThe route continues west to Port Allegany, where thereafter the river joins with a number of small streams and widens considerably before turning north and crossing into western New York. Looping westward across southern Cattaraugus County for approximately , past Portville, Olean, Allegany and Salamanca, the river flows through Seneca Indian Nation lands close to the northern boundary of Allegany State Park before re-entering northwestern Pennsylvania within the Allegheny Reservoir just east of the Warren-McKean county line, approx. northeast of Warren.\nIt flows in a broad zigzag course generally southwest across Western Pennsylvania; first flowing southwest past Warren, Tidioute, Tionesta, Oil City, and Franklin, forming much of the northwestern boundary of Allegheny National Forest. South of Franklin it turns southeast across Clarion County in a meandering course, then turns again southwest across Armstrong County, flowing past Kittanning, Ford City, Clinton, and Freeport.\nThe river enters both Allegheny and Westmoreland counties, the Pittsburgh suburbs, and the City of Pittsburgh from the northeast. It passes the North Side, downtown Pittsburgh, and Point State Park. The Allegheny joins with the Monongahela River at the \"Point\" in downtown Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River.\nHydrography.\nThe river is approximately long, running through the U.S. states of New York and Pennsylvania. It drains a rural dissected plateau of in the northern Allegheny Plateau, providing the northeasternmost drainage in the watershed of the Mississippi River. Its tributaries reach to within of Lake Erie in southwestern New York.\nWater from the Allegheny River eventually flows into the Gulf of Mexico via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.\nThe Allegheny Valley has been one of the most productive areas of fossil fuel extraction in United States history, with its extensive deposits of coal, petroleum, and natural gas.\nTributaries.\nIn its upper reaches, the Allegheny River is joined from the south by Potato Creek downstream of Coryville, Pennsylvania and from the north by Olean Creek at Olean, New York. Tunungwant \"Tuna\" Creek joins the river from the south in Carrollton, New York (flowing north from Bradford, Pennsylvania); the Great Valley Creek and Little Valley Creek join the river from the north at Salamanca, New York before becoming the Allegheny Reservoir.\nAfter re-entering Pennsylvania, the river is joined from the east by Kinzua Creek upstream of Warren; from the north by Conewango Creek at Warren; from the west by Brokenstraw Creek; from the east by East Hickory Creek at East Hickory; from the east by Tionesta Creek at Tionesta; from the north by Oil Creek at Oil City; from the west by French Creek at Franklin; from the east by the Clarion River, a principal tributary, at Parker; from the east by Crooked Creek southeast of Kittanning; and from the east by the Kiskiminetas River, another principal tributary, at Schenley.\nBuffalo Creek enters at Freeport, Chartiers Run enters at Lower Burrell, Bull Creek enters at Tarentum, Pucketa Creek enters near New Kensington, Riddle Run enters at Springdale, and Girtys Run enters at Millvale. And finally, the confluence of the Monongahela River and Allegheny form the Ohio River at downtown Pittsburgh. Many additional streams enter or join with the Allegheny River along its course.\nLocks, dams and bridges.\nSeveral locks were built in the early 20th century to make the Allegheny River navigable for 72 miles upstream from Pittsburgh to East Brady.\nThe Allegheny River has eight locks and fixed-crest dams numbered two through nine: Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 which form corresponding reservoirs.\nThe river is also impounded by the Kinzua Dam in northwestern Pennsylvania, resulting in the Allegheny Reservoir also known as Kinzua Lake and Lake Perfidy among the Seneca. The Seneca Pumped Storage Generating Station is associated with Kinzua Dam.\nNumerous bridges and tunnels span the river throughout its course. The Allegheny River Tunnel, utilized by Pittsburgh Light Rail, went into service in 2012.\nHistory.\nIn the latter half of the 17th century, control of the river valley passed back-and-forth between Algonquian-speaking Shawnee and the Iroquois. By the time of the arrival of French colonialists in the early 18th century, the Shawnee were once again in control and formed an alliance with France against attempts by colonists from British North America to settle across the Allegheny Mountains. The conflict over the expansion of Anglo-American settlement into the Allegheny Valley and the surrounding Ohio Country was a primary cause of the French and Indian War in the 1750s. During the war, the village of Kittanning \u2013 the principal Shawnee settlement on the river \u2013 was completely destroyed during the Kittanning Expedition, which saw 300 provincial troops from the Province of Pennsylvania brutally attack the settlement.\nAfter gaining control of the area in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, the British kept the area closed to Anglo-American colonists, in part to repair and maintain relations with the Native Americans. After the American Revolutionary War, the entire river valley became part of the new United States, and U.S. settlers forcibly displaced the region's indigenous population. During the 19th century, the river became a principal means of navigation in the upper Ohio valley, especially for the transport of coal. Although the building of the railroads lessened the importance of the river somewhat, the lower river (navigable as far as East Brady, Pennsylvania through locks) has continued to serve as a route of commercial transportation until the present day. In 1859, the first U.S. petroleum was drilled north of the river at Titusville. One of the underlying premises of the Genesee Valley Canal was its connection to the river, opening a trade route from Rochester, New York to the west. The advent of the railroads obviated any interest Pennsylvania might have had in participating to improve navigation on the river. The canal was closed in 1877 and the right-of-way sold to the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad.\nIn 1965, the completion of the federally sponsored Kinzua Dam for flood-control in northwestern Pennsylvania east of Warren created the long Allegheny Reservoir, known as Lake Perfidy among the Seneca, part of which is included in the Allegheny National Recreation Area. The dam flooded parts of lands deeded \"forever\" to the Seneca Nation of Indians by the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, and lands given to Cornplanter and his descendants. The event was described in the Johnny Cash song \"As Long as the Grass Shall Grow\" from the 1964 album \"\", which focused on the history of and problems facing Native Americans in the United States.\nThe construction of the dam and the filling of the Allegheny Reservoir also necessitated the elimination of the small village of Corydon, which was located at the confluence of Willow Creek with the Allegheny River; and the small village of Kinzua, which was located at the confluence of Kinzua Creek with the Allegheny River. All residents of both villages were forced to move.\nMany prominent individuals opposed the construction of the dam at that time because of the damage it would do to Seneca lands, including Pennsylvania Congressman John P. Saylor of Johnstown, and Howard Zahniser, executive director of The Wilderness Society and native of Tionesta\u2014a small settlement located along the Allegheny River several miles downstream from Warren.

{"id": "51825", "revid": "45397937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51825", "title": "Sun Tzu", "text": "Chinese general (544\u2013496 BC)\nSun Tzu (;) was a Chinese military general, strategist, philosopher, and writer who lived during the Eastern Zhou period (771\u2013256 BC). Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of \"The Art of War\", a Classical Chinese text on military strategy from the Warring States period, though the earliest parts of the work probably date to at least a century after him.\nSun Tzu is revered in Chinese and East Asian culture as a legendary historical and military figure; however, his historical existence is uncertain. The Han dynasty historian Sima Qian and other traditional Chinese historians placed him as a minister to King Hel\u00fc of Wu and dated his lifetime to 544\u2013496 BC. The name \"Sun Tzu\"\u2014by which he is more popularly known\u2014is an honorific which means \"Master Sun\". His birth name was said to be Sun Wu () and he is posthumously known by his courtesy name Changqing (). Traditional accounts state that the general's descendant Sun Bin wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled \"The Art of War\". Since both Sun Wu and Sun Bin were referred to as \"Sun Tzu\" in classical Chinese texts, some historians thought them identical, prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin's treatise in 1972.\nLife.\nThe earliest account of Sun Tzu's life is a short biography written around 97 BC by Sima Qian as part of his \"Shiji\" (Records of the Grand Historian). Sima Qian states that Sun Tzu was born in Qi near the end of the Spring and Autumn period (776\u2013471\u00a0BC), and that his courtesy name was \"Wu.\" The rest of the biography consists of an account of how King Hel\u00fc of Wu, having heard of Sun Wu's \"Art of War\", summoned him to the palace and asked him to demonstrate his ability to train soldiers by training the king's harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. \nSun Tzu was said to have divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders, and proceeded to give them orders, which they ignored, instead breaking out into laughter. Over the king's protestations, Sun Tzu then had the two concubines executed, at which the rest of the \"soldiers\" began to behave at once, and the king appointed Sun Wu as a general. He went on to lead the state of Wu to victory against the much larger state of Chu during the Battle of Boju in 506 BC. Later accounts also associate Sun Tzu with Wu Zixu, who was credited with the authorship of the \"Wuzi\", another ancient Chinese military text. Zixu was said to have been a refugee from Chu, and he introduced Sun Wu to King Helu.\nBeginning in the 12th century (during the Song dynasty), several Chinese scholars began to doubt the historical existence of Sun Tzu. During the Song dynasty, Ye Shi (1150\u20131223) noticed that the \"Zuo Zhuan\", which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period, does not mention Sun Tzu at all despite the fact that Sima Qian had claimed in the \"Records of the Grand Historian\" that Sun Tzu had proved on the battlefield that his theories were effective at the Battle of Boju. The \"Zuo Zhuan\", which was written centuries earlier than the \"Records of the Grand Historian\" and provides a much more detailed account of the Battle of Boju, does not mention Sun Tzu at all.\nThe name \"Sun Wu\" () does not appear in any text prior to the \"Records of the Grand Historian\", and may have been an invented descriptive cognomen meaning \"the fugitive warrior\"\u00a0\u2013 the surname \"Sun\" can be glossed as the related term \"fugitive\" ( ), while \"Wu\" is the ancient Chinese virtue of \"martial, valiant\" (\"w\u01d4\" ), or a Jianghuai dialectal synonym of \"knight\", which corresponds to Sunzi's role as the hero's doppelg\u00e4nger in the story of Wu Zixu. \nFurthermore, the earliest parts of \"The Art of War\", the work traditionally credited to Sun Tzu, probably dates to at least a century after him. Anachronisms in \"The Art of War\" include terms, technology (such as anachronistic crossbows), philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques that should not have been available to Sun Wu. Additionally, there are no records of professional generals during the Spring and Autumn period; these are only extant from the Warring States period, so there is doubt as to Sun Tzu's rank and generalship. This caused much confusion as to when \"The Art of War\" was actually written; since the 12th century, most scholars from the Song and Qing Dynasty along with modern Chinese, Japanese and Western scholars follow Ye Shi in assigning the text to the beginning of the Warring States period. This later dating has been bolstered by the discovery of the text on bamboo slips accidentally unearthed by construction workers at Yinque Shan in Shandong in 1972, which had been sealed between 134 and 118 BC. The content of the earlier text is about one-third of the chapters of the modern \"The Art of War\", and their texts match very closely. \nAnother text discovered in the same collection was Sun Bin's \"Military Methods\", a previously lost work that had been attributed to one of Sun Wu's descendants by Han dynasty bibliographies. Due to its close relationship with the \"Art of War\", \"Military Methods\" provides important context on the body of military thought in Chinese late antiquity. In the early 20th century, the Chinese writer and reformer Liang Qichao had theorized that the text of the \"Art of War\" was actually written in the 4th century BC by this purported descendant of Sun Tzu. Although this hypothesis is no longer tenable, the Sun Bin text's material overlaps with much of the \"Sun Tzu\" text, and the two may be \"a single, continuously developing intellectual tradition united under the Sun name\". Unlike Sun Wu, Sun Bin appears to have been an actual person who was a genuine authority on military matters and may have been the inspiration for the creation of the historical figure \"Sun Tzu\" through a form of euhemerism. This discovery also demonstrated that much of the historical confusion about anecdotes attributed to Sun Tzu could have been due to the fact that there were two authors that could have been referred to as \"Master Sun.\"\n\"The Art of War\".\nThe environment that was fostered was marked by the Warring States period (475-221 BC). The Warring States period was marked by military conflicts and conquests, as well as political instability. This would then foster the development of philosophical and strategic texts like \"The Art of War.\"\n\"The Art of War\", traditionally ascribed to Sun Tzu, is a Classical Chinese text dating from the Warring States period. The work is composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to a different set of skills or arts related to warfare and how they apply to military strategy and tactics. The book further outlines theories of battle, but it also advocates diplomacy and the cultivation of relationships with other nations as essential to the health of a state. \nIn addition, Taoist rhetoric is a component incorporated into the \"Art of War\". According to Steven C. Combs in \"Sun-zi and the \"Art of War\": The Rhetoric of Parsimony\", warfare is \"used as a metaphor for rhetoric, and that both are philosophically based arts.\" Combs writes: \"Warfare is analogous to persuasion, as a battle for hearts and minds.\" Combs compares Taoist and Aristotelian rhetoric, notably for the differences in persuasion. Taoist rhetoric in \"The Art of War\" is described as \"peaceful and passive, favoring silence over speech\". Frugal behavior, which is emphasized extensively in \"The Art of War\" as avoiding confrontation and being spiritual in nature, shapes basic principles in Taoism.\nLegacy.\nSun Tzu's \"Art of War\" has influenced many notable figures and is accepted as a masterpiece on strategy. It has been frequently cited and by generals and theorists since it was first published, translated, and distributed internationally. \n\"The Art of War\" was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven ancient Chinese states\u2014Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan\u2014who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in Eastern China. For almost 1,500 years, it was the lead text in an anthology that was formalized as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. \"The Art of War\" remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare. \n\"The Art of War\" appears throughout the bibliographical catalogs of the Chinese dynastic histories, but listings of its divisions and size varied widely. The strategist and warlord Cao Cao in the early 3rd century of the Common Era authored the earliest known commentary to the \"Art of War\". Cao's preface makes clear that he edited the text and removed certain passages, but the extent of his changes was unclear historically. In the 12th century, Ji Tianbao compiled a collection of commentaries on \"The Art of War\" which included Cao Cao's commentary along with several later ones that are frequently cited, including Meng Shi (502-557), Li Quan (c.\u2009750), Jia Lin (c.\u2009late 8th c.), Du You (735-812), Du Mu (803-852), Chen Hao (c.\u2009Tang dynasty), Mei Yaochen (1002 - 1060), Wang Xi (c.\u20091082), He Yanxi (c.\u2009late 11th c.), and Zhang Yu (c.\u2009Southern Song dynasty). Although most of these later commentaries have little value for philology or historical analysis of the original text, they attest to the continued interest in the text throughout Chinese history.\n\"The Art of War\" was introduced into Nara Japan in the year 760 of the Common Era, and the book quickly became popular among Japanese generals. Through its later influence on the Sengoku period \"Great Unifiers\" of Japan, Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, it significantly affected the unification of Japan in the early modern era. After the Meiji Restoration, the book remained popular among the Imperial Japanese armed forces. Admiral T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d, who led Japan's forces to victory in the Russo-Japanese War, was an avid reader of Sun Tzu.\nThe book was translated into French and published in 1772 by the French priest Jesuit Jean Joseph Marie Amiot; it was re-published in 1782. A partial translation into English was attempted by British officer Everard Ferguson Calthrop in 1905 under the title \"The Book of War\". The first annotated English translation was completed and published by Lionel Giles in 1910. \nIn the twentieth century, military and political leaders such as the Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong and Vietnamese general V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p are cited along with American military generals Douglas MacArthur and Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. as having drawn inspiration from the book. Mao Zedong partially credited his 1949 victory over Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang to \"The Art of War\". The work strongly influenced writings about warfare in Mao's \"Little Red Book\", which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world. Ho Chi Minh translated the work for his Vietnamese officers to study. His general V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p was likewise an avid student and practitioner of Sun Tzu's ideas.\nIn \"Sun Tzu and the Art of Modern Warfare\", Mark McNeilly writes that a modern interpretation of Sun and his importance throughout Chinese history is critical in understanding China's push to become a superpower in the twenty-first century. Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategy and \"The Art of War\" in developing their theories, seeing a direct relationship between their modern struggles and those of China in Sun Tzu's time. Sun Tzu's teachings and are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.\nSome admirers of Sun Tzu's work claim that it has relevance in competitive endeavors across the modern world beyond military strategy and warfare, including espionage, culture, governance, business, and sports.\nSun Tzu has been mentioned often in popular American culture. For example, in the 1987 film \"Wall Street\", the protagonist Gordon Gekko frequently cites passages from \"The Art of War\" as guiding principles for his aggressive trading techniques.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His task was to reorganise the Catholic Church, after the persecutions of Emperor Valerian I, and the edict of toleration by his successor Gallienus. He also helped rebuild the churches of Cappadocia, devastated by the marauding Goths.\nPontificate.\nDionysius was born in Terranova da Sibari in the early 3rd century. He was elected pope in 259, after the martyrdom of Sixtus II in 258. The Holy See had been vacant for nearly a year because it was difficult to elect a new pope during the violent persecution which Christians faced. When the oppression had begun to subside, Dionysius was raised to the office of Bishop of Rome. Emperor Valerian I, who had led the tyranny, was captured and killed by the King of Persia in 260. The new emperor, Gallienus, issued an edict of toleration, restoring the churches, cemeteries and other properties it had held, ushering in the nearly 40-year \"Little Peace of the Church\". To the new pope fell the task of reshaping the Catholic Church, which had fallen into great disorder.\nTeaching regarding the relation of God to the Logos had arisen from Bishop Dionysius in Alexandria. The pope in Rome called for explanations; a satisfactory response duly arrived back, notwithstanding expostulation about the propriety of all this from some of the Alexandrian Christians.\nTo rebuild, and to ransom those held captive, Pope Dionysius sent large sums of money to the churches of Cappadocia, devastated by marauding Goths. Following Emperor Gallienus' edict of toleration, he brought order to the church and helped secure a peace that lasted until 303, some 35 years after his death on 26 December 268.\nAccording to St. Athanasius, Pope St. Dionysius retroactively condemned Arianism far before the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea on behalf of the entire Church saying, \"For Dionysius, Bishop of Rome, having written also against those who said that the Son of God was a creature and a created thing, it is manifest that not now for the first time but from of old the heresy of the Arian adversaries of Christ has been \"anathematised by all\".\"\nIn art, Dionysius is portrayed in papal vestments, along with a book.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Rodinia broke up in the Neoproterozoic, with its continental fragments reassembled to form Pannotia 633\u2013573 Ma. In contrast with Pannotia, little is known about Rodinia's configuration and geodynamic history. Paleomagnetic evidence provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the Earth's crust, but not to their longitude, which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features, often now widely dispersed.\nThe extreme cooling of the global climate around 717\u2013635 Ma (the so-called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes.\nGeodynamics.\nPaleogeographic reconstructions.\nThe idea that a supercontinent existed in the early Neoproterozoic arose in the 1970s, when geologists determined that orogens of this age exist on virtually all cratons. Examples are the Grenville orogeny in North America and the Dalslandian orogeny in Europe. Since then, many alternative reconstructions have been proposed for the configuration of the cratons in this supercontinent. Most of these reconstructions are based on the correlation of the orogens on different cratons. Though the configuration of the core cratons in Rodinia is now reasonably well known, recent reconstructions still differ in many details. Geologists try to decrease the uncertainties by collecting geological and paleomagnetical data.\nMost reconstructions show Rodinia's core formed by the North American Craton (the later paleocontinent of Laurentia), surrounded in the southeast with the East European Craton (the later paleocontinent of Baltica), the Amazonian Craton and the West African Craton; in the south with the R\u00edo de la Plata and S\u00e3o Francisco cratons; in the southwest with the Congo and Kalahari cratons; and in the northeast with Australia, India and eastern Antarctica. The positions of Siberia and North and South China north of the North American craton differ strongly depending on the reconstruction:\nLittle is known about the paleogeography before the formation of Rodinia. Paleomagnetic and geologic data are only definite enough to form reconstructions from the breakup of Rodinia onwards. Rodinia is considered to have formed between 1.3 and 1.23 Ga and broke up again before 750 Ma. Rodinia was surrounded by the superocean Mirovia.\nAccording to J.D.A. Piper, Rodinia is one of two models for the configuration and history of the continental crust in the latter part of Precambrian times. The other is Paleopangea, Piper's own concept. Piper proposes an alternative hypothesis for this era and the previous ones. This idea rejects that Rodinia ever existed as a transient supercontinent subject to progressive break-up in the late Proterozoic and instead that this time and earlier times were dominated by a single, persistent \"Paleopangaea\" supercontinent. As evidence, he suggests an observation that the palaeomagnetic poles from the continental crust assigned to this time conform to a single path between 825 and 633 Ma and latterly to a near-static position between 750 and 633 Ma. This latter solution predicts that break-up was confined to the Ediacaran period and produced the dramatic environmental changes that characterised the transition between the Precambrian and Phanerozoic. However, this theory has been widely criticized, as incorrect applications of paleomagnetic data have been pointed out.\nBreakup.\nIn 2009 UNESCO's International Geoscience Programme project 440, named \"Rodinia Assembly and Breakup,\" concluded that Rodinia broke up in four stages between 825 and 550 Ma:\nThe Rodinia hypothesis assumes that rifting did not start everywhere simultaneously. Extensive lava flows and volcanic eruptions of Neoproterozoic age are found on most continents, evidence for large scale rifting about 750 Ma. As early as 850 to 800 Ma, a rift developed between the continental masses of present-day Australia, East Antarctica, India and the Congo and Kalahari cratons on one side and later Laurentia, Baltica, Amazonia and the West African and Rio de la Plata cratons on the other. This rift developed into the Adamastor Ocean during the Ediacaran.\nAround 550 Ma, near the boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian, the first group of cratons fused again with Amazonia, West Africa and the Rio de la Plata cratons during the Pan-African orogeny, which caused the development of Gondwana.\nIn a separate rifting event about 610 Ma, the Iapetus Ocean formed. The eastern part of this ocean formed between Baltica and Laurentia, the western part between Amazonia and Laurentia. Because the timeframe of this separation and the partially contemporaneous Pan-African orogeny are difficult to correlate, it might be that all continental mass was again joined in one supercontinent between roughly 600 and 550 Ma. This hypothetical supercontinent is called Pannotia.\nInfluence on paleoclimate and life.\nUnlike later supercontinents, Rodinia was entirely barren. It existed before complex life colonized on dry land. Based on sedimentary rock analysis, Rodinia's formation happened when the ozone layer was not as extensive as it is now. Ultraviolet light discouraged organisms from inhabiting its interior. Nevertheless, its existence significantly influenced the marine life of its time.\nIn the Cryogenian, Earth experienced large glaciations, and temperatures were at least as cool as today. Substantial parts of Rodinia may have been covered by glaciers or the southern polar ice cap. Low temperatures may have been exaggerated during the early stages of continental rifting. Geothermal heating peaks in crust about to be rifted, and since warmer rocks are less dense, the crustal rocks rise up relative to their surroundings. This rising creates areas of higher altitude where the air is cooler and ice is less likely to melt with changes in season, and it may explain the evidence of abundant glaciation in the Ediacaran.\nThe rifting of the continents created new oceans and seafloor spreading, which produces warmer, less dense oceanic crust. Lower-density, hot oceanic crust will not lie as deep as older, cool oceanic lithosphere. In periods with relatively large areas of new lithosphere, the ocean floors come up, causing the sea level to rise. The result was a greater number of shallower seas.\nThe increased evaporation from the oceans' larger water area may have increased rainfall, which in turn increased the weathering of exposed rock. By inputting data on the ratio of stable isotopes 18O:16O into computer models, it has been shown that in conjunction with quick weathering of volcanic rock, the increased rainfall may have reduced greenhouse gas levels to below the threshold required to trigger the period of extreme glaciation known as Snowball Earth. Increased volcanic activity also introduced into the marine environment biologically active nutrients, which may have played an important role in the earliest animals' development.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He rose to power during a particularly unstable period during the Crisis of the Third Century and appointed his son Gallienus as co-emperor.\nValerian is known as the first Roman emperor to have been taken captive in battle, captured by the Persian emperor Shapur I after the Battle of Edessa, causing shock and instability throughout the Roman Empire. The unprecedented event and rumors of his humiliation at the hands of the Persian emperor generated a variety of different reactions and \"new narratives about the Roman Empire in diverse contexts\".\nBiography.\nOrigins and rise to power.\nUnlike many of the would-be emperors and rebels who vied for imperial power during the Crisis of the Third Century, Valerian was of a noble and traditional senatorial family. Details of his early life are sparse, except for his marriage to Egnatia Mariniana, with whom he had two sons: Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus (his co-emperor and later successor) and Licinius Valerianus.\nValerian was consul for the first time either before AD 238 as a \"Suffectus\" or in 238 as an \"Ordinarius\". In 238 he was \"princeps senatus\", and Gordian I negotiated through him for senatorial acknowledgement for his claim as emperor. In 251 AD, when Decius revived the censorship with legislative and executive powers so extensive that it practically embraced the civil authority of the emperor, Valerian was chosen censor by the Senate, though he declined to accept the post. During the reign of Decius he was left in charge of affairs in Rome when that prince left for his ill-fated last campaign in Illyricum. Under Trebonianus Gallus, Valerian was appointed \"dux\" of an army probably drawn from the garrisons of the German provinces which seems to have been ultimately intended for use in a war against the Persians.\nHowever, when Trebonianus Gallus had to deal with the rebellion of Aemilianus in 253 AD, he turned to Valerian for assistance in crushing the attempted usurpation. Valerian headed south but was too late: Gallus was killed by his own troops, who joined Aemilianus before Valerian arrived. The Raetian soldiers then proclaimed Valerian emperor and continued their march towards Rome. Upon his arrival in September, Aemilianus's legions defected, killed him and proclaimed Valerian emperor. In Rome, the Senate quickly acknowledged Valerian.\nRule and fall.\nValerian's first act as emperor was to appoint his son Gallienus \"augustus\", thus making him co-emperor. Early in his reign, affairs in Europe went from bad to worse, and the whole West fell into disorder. In the East, Antioch had fallen into the hands of a Sassanid vassal and Armenia was occupied by Shapur I (Sapor). Valerian and Gallienus split the problems of the empire between them, with the son taking the West, and the father heading East to face the Persian threat.\nIn 254, 255, and 257, Valerian again became \"Consul Ordinarius.\" By 257, he had recovered Antioch and returned the province of Syria to Roman control. The following year, the Goths ravaged Asia Minor. In 259, Valerian moved on to Edessa, but an outbreak of plague killed a critical number of legionaries, weakening the Roman position, and the town was besieged by the Persians. In 260, probably in June, Valerian was decisively defeated in the Battle of Edessa and held prisoner for the remainder of his life. Valerian's capture was a tremendous defeat for the Romans.\nPersecution of Christians.\nWhile fighting the Persians, Valerian sent two letters to the Senate ordering that firm steps be taken against Christians. The first, sent in 257, commanded Christian clergy to perform sacrifices to the Roman gods or face banishment. The second, the following year, ordered the execution of Christian leaders. It also required Christian senators and equites to perform acts of worship to the Roman gods or lose their titles and property, and directed that they be executed if they continued to refuse. It also decreed that Roman matrons who would not apostatize should lose their property and be banished, and that civil servants and members of the Imperial household who would not worship the Roman gods should be reduced to slavery and sent to work on the Imperial estates. This indicates that Christians were well-established at that time, some in very high positions.\nThe execution of Saint Prudent at Narbonne is taken to have occurred in 257.\nProminent Christians executed in 258 included Pope Sixtus II (6 August), Saint Romanus Ostiarius (9 August) and Saint Lawrence (10 August).\nOthers executed in 258 included the saints Denis in Paris, Pontius in Cimiez, Cyprian and others in Carthage and Eugenia in Rome. \nIn 259 Saint Patroclus was executed at Troyes and Saint Fructuosus at Tarragona.\nWhen Valerian's son Gallienus became emperor in 260, the decree was rescinded.\nDeath in captivity.\nEutropius, writing between 364 and 378 AD, stated that Valerian \"was overthrown by Shapur king of Persia, and being soon after made prisoner, grew old in ignominious slavery among the Parthians.\" An early Christian source, Lactantius (thought to be virulently anti-Persian due to the occasional persecution of Christians by some Sasanian monarchs) maintained that, for some time prior to his death, Valerian was subjected to the greatest insults by his captors, like being used as a human footstool by Shapur when mounting his horse. According to this version of events, after a long period of such treatment, Valerian offered Shapur a huge ransom for his release.\nIn reply (according to one version), Shapur was said to have forced Valerian to swallow molten gold (the other version of his death is almost the same but it says that Valerian was killed by being flayed alive) and then had Valerian skinned and his skin stuffed with straw and preserved as a trophy in the main Persian temple. It was further alleged that it was only after a later Persian defeat against Rome that his skin was given a cremation and burial. The captivity and death of Valerian has been frequently debated by historians without any definitive conclusion.\nAccording to the modern scholar Touraj Daryaee, contrary to the account of Lactantius, Shapur I sent Valerian and some of his army to the city of Bishapur or Gundishapur where they lived in relatively good conditions. Shapur used the remaining soldiers in engineering and development plans. \"Band-e Kaisar\" (Caesar's dam) is one of the remnants of Roman engineering located near the ancient city of Susa. In all the stone carvings on Naghshe-Rostam, in Iran, Valerian is represented holding hands with Shapur I, a sign of submission. According to the early Persian Muslim scholar Abu Hanifa Dinawari, Shapur settled the prisoners of war in Gundishapur and released Valerian, as promised, after the construction of Band-e Kaisar.\nIt has been alleged that the account of Lactantius is coloured by his desire to establish that persecutors of the Christians died fitting deaths; the story was repeated then and later by authors in the Roman Near East fiercely hostile to Persia.\nThe joint rule of Valerian and Gallienus was threatened several times by usurpers.

{"id": "51834", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51834", "title": "Geneva Protocol", "text": "Treaty prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts\nThe Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, usually called the Geneva Protocol, is a treaty prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts. It was signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 and entered into force on 8 February 1928. It was registered in \"League of Nations Treaty Series\" on 7 September 1929. The Geneva Protocol is a protocol to the Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War signed on the same date, and followed the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.\nIt prohibits the use of \"asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices\" and \"bacteriological methods of warfare\". This is now understood to be a general prohibition on chemical weapons and biological weapons between state parties, but has nothing to say about production, storage or transfer. Later treaties did cover these aspects \u2013 the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\nA number of countries submitted reservations when becoming parties to the Geneva Protocol, declaring that they only regarded the non-use obligations as applying to other parties and that these obligations would cease to apply if the prohibited weapons were used against them.\nNegotiation history.\nIn the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, the use of dangerous chemical agents was outlawed. In spite of this, the First World War saw large-scale chemical warfare. France used tear gas in 1914, but the first large-scale successful deployment of chemical weapons was by the German Empire in Ypres, Belgium in 1915, when chlorine gas was released as part of a German attack at the Battle of Gravenstafel. Following this, a chemical arms race began, with the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, and Italy joining France and Germany in the use of chemical weapons.\nThis resulted in the development of a range of horrific chemicals affecting lungs, skin, or eyes. Some were intended to be lethal on the battlefield, like hydrogen cyanide, and efficient methods of deploying agents were invented. At least 124,000 tons were produced during the war. In 1918, about one grenade out of three was filled with dangerous chemical agents. Around 500k-1.3 million casualties of the conflict were attributed to the use of gas, and the psychological effect on troops may have had a much greater effect. A few thousand civilians also became casualties as collateral damage or due to production accidents.\nThe Treaty of Versailles included some provisions that banned Germany from either manufacturing or importing chemical weapons. Similar treaties banned the First Austrian Republic, the Kingdom of Bulgaria, and the Kingdom of Hungary from chemical weapons, all belonging to the losing side, the Central powers. Russian bolsheviks and Britain continued the use of chemical weapons in the Russian Civil War and possibly in the Middle East in 1920.\nThree years after World War I, the Allies wanted to reaffirm the Treaty of Versailles, and in 1922 the United States introduced the Treaty relating to the Use of Submarines and Noxious Gases in Warfare at the Washington Naval Conference. Four of the war victors, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan, gave consent for ratification, but it failed to enter into force as the French Third Republic objected to the submarine provisions of the treaty.\nAt the 1925 Geneva Conference for the Supervision of the International Traffic in Arms the French suggested a protocol for non-use of poisonous gases. The Second Polish Republic suggested the addition of bacteriological weapons. It was signed on 17 June.\nHistorical assessment.\nEric Croddy, assessing the Protocol in 2005, took the view that the historic record showed it had been largely ineffectual. Specifically it does not prohibit:\nIn light of these shortcomings, Jack Beard notes that \"the Protocol (...) resulted in a legal framework that allowed states to conduct [biological weapons] research, develop new biological weapons, and ultimately engage in [biological weapons] arms races\".\nAdditionally, the use of chemical weapons inside the nation's own territory against its citizens or subjects is not prohibited, such as those employed by Spain in the Rif War until 1927, Japan against Seediq indigenous rebels in Taiwan (then part of the Japanese colonial empire) in 1930 during the Musha Incident, Iraq against ethnic Kurdish civilians in the 1988 attack on Halabja during the Iran\u2013Iraq War, and Syria or Syrian opposition forces during the Syrian civil war.\nDespite the U.S. having been a proponent of the protocol, the U.S. military and American Chemical Society lobbied against it, causing the U.S. Senate not to ratify the protocol until 1975, the same year when the United States ratified the Biological Weapons Convention.\nViolations.\nSeveral state parties have deployed chemical weapons for combat in spite of the treaty. Italy used mustard gas against the Ethiopian Empire in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. In World War II, Germany employed chemical weapons in combat on several occasions along the Black Sea, notably in Sevastopol, where they used toxic smoke to force Soviet resistance fighters out of caverns below the city. They also used asphyxiating gas in the catacombs of Odesa in November 1941, following their capture of the city, and in late May 1942 during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula in eastern Crimea, perpetrated by the Wehrmacht's Chemical Forces and organized by a special detail of SS troops with the help of a field engineer battalion. After the battle in mid-May 1942, the Germans gassed and killed almost 3,000 of the besieged and non-evacuated Red Army soldiers and Soviet civilians hiding in a series of caves and tunnels in the nearby Adzhimushkay quarry.\nDuring the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War, Iraq is known to have employed a variety of chemical weapons against Iranian forces. Some 100,000 Iranian troops were casualties of Iraqi chemical weapons during the war.\nSubsequent interpretation of the protocol.\nIn 1966, United Nations General Assembly resolution 2162B called for, without any dissent, all states to strictly observe the protocol. In 1969, United Nations General Assembly resolution 2603 (XXIV) declared that the prohibition on use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts, as embodied in the protocol (though restated in a more general form), were generally recognized rules of international law. Following this, there was discussion of whether the main elements of the protocol now form part of customary international law, and now this is widely accepted to be the case.\nThere have been differing interpretations over whether the protocol covers the use of harassing agents, such as adamsite and tear gas, and defoliants and herbicides, such as Agent Orange, in warfare. The 1977 Environmental Modification Convention prohibits the military use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides in warfare, but it does require case-by-case consideration. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention effectively banned riot control agents from being used as a method of warfare, though still permitting it for riot control.\nIn recent times, the protocol had been interpreted to cover non-international armed conflicts as well international ones. In 1995, an appellate chamber in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia stated that \"there had undisputedly emerged a general consensus in the international community on the principle that the use of chemical weapons is also prohibited in internal armed conflicts.\" In 2005, the International Committee of the Red Cross concluded that customary international law includes a ban on the use of chemical weapons in internal as well as international conflicts.\nHowever, such views drew general criticism from legal authors. They noted that much of the chemical arms control agreements stems from the context of \"international\" conflicts. Furthermore, the application of customary international law to banning chemical warfare in non-international conflicts fails to meet two requirements: state practice and \"opinio juris\". Jillian Blake &amp; Aqsa Mahmud cited the periodic use of chemical weapons in non-international conflicts since the end of WWI (as stated above) as well as the lack of existing international humanitarian law (such as the Geneva Conventions) and national legislation and manuals prohibiting using them in such conflicts. Anne Lorenzat stated the 2005 ICRC study was rooted in \"'political and operational issues rather than legal ones\".\nState parties.\nTo become party to the Protocol, states must deposit an instrument with the government of France (the depositary power). Thirty-eight states originally signed the Protocol. France was the first signatory to ratify the Protocol on 10 May 1926. El Salvador, the final signatory to ratify the Protocol, did so on 26 February 2008. As of April 2021, 146 states have ratified, acceded to, or succeeded to the Protocol, most recently Colombia on 24 November 2015.\nReservations.\nA number of countries submitted reservations when becoming parties to the Geneva Protocol, declaring that they only regarded the non-use obligations as applying with respect to other parties to the Protocol and/or that these obligations would cease to apply with respect to any state, or its allies, which used the prohibited weapons. Several Arab states also declared that their ratification did not constitute recognition of, or diplomatic relations with, Israel, or that the provision of the Protocol were not binding with respect to Israel.\nGenerally, reservations not only modify treaty provisions for the reserving party, but also symmetrically modify the provisions for previously ratifying parties in dealing with the reserving party. Subsequently, numerous states have withdrawn their reservations, including the former Czechoslovakia in 1990 prior to its dissolution, or the Russian reservation on biological weapons that \"preserved the right to retaliate in kind if attacked\" with them, which was dissolved by President Yeltsin.\nAccording to the Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties, states which succeed to a treaty after gaining independence from a state party \"shall be considered as maintaining any reservation to that treaty which was applicable at the date of the succession of States in respect of the territory to which the succession of States relates unless, when making the notification of succession, it expresses a contrary intention or formulates a reservation which relates to the same subject matter as that reservation.\" While some states have explicitly either retained or renounced their reservations inherited on succession, states which have not clarified their position on their inherited reservations are listed as \"implicit\" reservations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Parties with withdrawn reservations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Parties with implicit reservations \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Parties with unwithdrawn reservations limiting the applicability of provisions of the Protocol\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNon-signatory states.\nThe remaining UN member states and UN observers that have not acceded or succeeded to the Protocol are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "51836", "revid": "19235292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51836", "title": "Chemical Weapons Convention", "text": "Multilateral treaty prohibiting the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), officially the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, is an arms control treaty administered by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an intergovernmental organization based in The Hague, Netherlands. The treaty entered into force on 29 April 1997. It prohibits the use of chemical weapons, and the large-scale development, production, stockpiling, or transfer of chemical weapons or their precursors, except for very limited purposes (research, medical, pharmaceutical or protective). The main obligation of member states under the convention is to effect this prohibition, as well as the destruction of all current chemical weapons. All destruction activities must take place under OPCW verification.\nAs of August 2022,[ [update]] 193 states have become parties to the CWC and accept its obligations. Israel has signed but not ratified the agreement, while three other UN member states (Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan) have neither signed nor acceded to the treaty. Most recently, the State of Palestine deposited its instrument of accession to the CWC on 17 May 2018. In September 2013, Syria acceded to the convention as part of an agreement for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons.\nUnder the convention, the entirety of the chemical weapons stockpiles declared by the States Parties to the convention have been irreversibly destroyed, an achievement reached in July 2023. The convention has provisions for systematic evaluation of chemical production facilities, as well as for investigations of allegations of use and production of chemical weapons based on the intelligence of other state parties.\nSome chemicals which have been used extensively in warfare but have numerous large-scale industrial uses (such as phosgene) are highly regulated; however, certain notable exceptions exist. Chlorine gas is highly toxic, but being a pure element and widely used for peaceful purposes, is not officially listed as a chemical weapon. Certain state powers (e.g. the former Assad regime of Syria) continue to regularly manufacture and implement such chemicals in combat munitions. Although these chemicals are not specifically listed as controlled by the CWC, the use of any toxic chemical as a weapon (when used to produce fatalities solely or mainly through its toxic action) is in and of itself forbidden by the treaty. Other chemicals, such as white phosphorus, are highly toxic but are legal under the CWC when they are used by military forces for reasons other than their toxicity.\nHistory.\nThe CWC augments the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which bans the use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts, but not their development or possession. The CWC also includes extensive verification measures such as on-site inspections, in stark contrast to the 1975 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which lacks a verification regime.\nAfter several changes of name and composition, the ENDC evolved into the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in 1984. On 3 September 1992 the CD submitted to the U.N. General Assembly its annual report, which contained the text of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The General Assembly approved the convention on 30 November 1992, and the U.N. Secretary-General then opened the convention for signature in Paris on 13 January 1993. The CWC remained open for signature until its entry into force on 29 April 1997, 180 days after the deposit at the UN by Hungary of the 65th instrument of ratification.\nOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).\nThe convention is administered by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which acts as the legal platform for specification of the CWC provisions. The Conference of the States Parties is mandated to change the CWC and pass regulations on the implementation of CWC requirements. The Technical Secretariat of the organization conducts inspections to ensure compliance of member states. These inspections target destruction facilities (where constant monitoring takes place during destruction), chemical weapons production facilities which have been dismantled or converted for civil use, as well as inspections of the chemical industry. The Secretariat may furthermore conduct \"investigations of alleged use\" of chemical weapons and give assistance after use of chemical weapons.\nThe 2013 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the organization because it had, with the Chemical Weapons Convention, \"defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law\" according to Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\nKey points of the Convention.\nControlled substances.\nThe convention distinguishes three classes of controlled substance, chemicals that can either be used as weapons themselves or used in the manufacture of weapons. The classification is based on the quantities of the substance produced commercially for legitimate purposes. Each class is split into Part A, which are chemicals that can be used directly as weapons, and Part B, which are chemicals useful in the manufacture of chemical weapons. Separate from the precursors, the convention defines toxic chemicals as \"[a]ny chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals. This includes all such chemicals, regardless of their origin or of their method of production, and regardless of whether they are produced in facilities, in munitions or elsewhere.\"\nMany of the chemicals named in the schedules are simply examples from a wider class, defined with Markush like language. For example, all chemicals in the class \"O-Alkyl (&lt;=C10, incl. cycloalkyl) alkyl (Me, Et, n-Pr or i-Pr)- phosphonofluoridates chemicals\" are controlled, despite only a few named examples being given, such as Soman.\nThis can make it more challenging for companies to identify if chemicals they handle are subject to the CWC, especially Schedule 2 and 3 chemicals (such as Alkylphosphorus chemicals).\u00a0 For example, Amgard 1045 is a flame retardant, but falls within Schedule 2B as part of Alkylphosphorus chemical class. This approach is also used in controlled drug legislation in many countries and are often termed \"class wide controls\" or \"generic statements\".\nDue to the added complexity these statements bring in identifying regulated chemicals, many companies choose to carry out these assessments computationally, examining the chemicals structure using in silico tools which compare them to the legislation statements, either with in house systems maintained a company or by the use commercial compliance software solutions.\nA treaty party may declare a \"single small-scale facility\" that produces up to 1 tonne of Schedule 1 chemicals for research, medical, pharmaceutical or protective purposes each year, and also another facility may produce 10\u00a0kg per year for protective testing purposes. An unlimited number of other facilities may produce Schedule 1 chemicals, subject to a total 10\u00a0kg annual limit, for research, medical or pharmaceutical purposes, but any facility producing more than 100 grams must be declared.\nThe treaty also deals with carbon compounds called in the treaty \"discrete organic chemicals\", the majority of which exhibit moderate-high direct toxicity or can be readily converted into compounds with toxicity sufficient for practical use as a chemical weapon. These are any carbon compounds apart from long chain polymers, oxides, sulfides and metal carbonates, such as organophosphates. The OPCW must be informed of, and can inspect, any plant producing (or expecting to produce) more than 200 tonnes per year, or 30 tonnes if the chemical contains phosphorus, sulfur or fluorine, unless the plant solely produces explosives or hydrocarbons.\nCategory definitions.\nChemical weapons are divided into three categories:\nMember states.\nBefore the CWC came into force in 1997, 165 states signed the convention, allowing them to ratify the agreement after obtaining domestic approval. Following the treaty's entry into force, it was closed for signature and the only method for non-signatory states to become a party was through accession. As of March 2021, 193 states, representing over 98 percent of the world's population, are party to the CWC. Of the four United Nations member states that are not parties to the treaty, Israel has signed but not ratified the treaty, while Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan have neither signed nor acceded to the convention. Taiwan, though not a member state, has stated on 27 August 2002 that it fully complies with the treaty.\nKey organizations of member states.\nMember states are represented at the OPCW by their Permanent Representative. This function is generally combined with the function of Ambassador. For the preparation of OPCW inspections and preparation of declarations, member states have to constitute a National Authority.\nWorld stockpile of chemical weapons.\nA total of 72,304 metric tonnes of chemical agent, and 97 production facilities have been declared to OPCW.\nTreaty deadlines.\nThe treaty set up several steps with deadlines toward complete destruction of chemical weapons, with a procedure for requesting deadline extensions. No country reached total elimination by the original treaty date although several finished under allowed extensions.\nProgress of destruction.\nOn 7 July 2023, the OPCW announced that all 72,304.34 metric tonnes of declared chemical agent had been verifiably destroyed.\nSeven state parties have completed the destruction of their declared stockpiles: Albania, India, Iraq, Libya, Syria, the United States, and an unspecified state party (believed to be South Korea). Russia also completed the destruction of its declared stockpile. According to the US Arms Control Association, the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in 2018 and the poisoning of Alexei Navalny in 2020 indicated that Russia maintained an illicit chemical weapons program. \nJapan and China in October 2010 began the destruction of World War II era chemical weapons abandoned by Japan in China by means of mobile destruction units and reported destruction of 35,203 chemical weapons (75% of the Nanjing stockpile).\nIraqi stockpile.\nThe U.N. Security Council ordered the dismantling of Iraq's chemical weapon stockpile in 1991. By 1998, UNSCOM inspectors had accounted for the destruction of 88,000 filled and unfilled chemical munitions, over 690 metric tons of weaponized and bulk chemical agents, approximately 4,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, and 980 pieces of key production equipment. The UNSCOM inspectors left in 1998.\nIn 2009, before Iraq joined the CWC, the OPCW reported that the United States military had destroyed almost 5,000 old chemical weapons in open-air detonations since 2004. These weapons, produced before the 1991 Gulf War, contained sarin and mustard agents but were so badly corroded that they could not have been used as originally intended.\nWhen Iraq joined the CWC in 2009, it declared \"two bunkers with filled and unfilled chemical weapons munitions, some precursors, as well as five former chemical weapons production facilities\" according to OPCW Director General Rogelio Pfirter. The bunker entrances were sealed with 1.5 meters of reinforced concrete in 1994 under UNSCOM supervision. As of 2012, the plan to destroy the chemical weapons was still being developed, in the face of significant difficulties. In 2014, ISIS took control of the site.\nOn 13 March 2018, the Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), Ambassador Ahmet \u00dcz\u00fcmc\u00fc, congratulated the Government of Iraq on the completion of the destruction of the country's chemical weapons remnants.\nSyrian destruction.\nFollowing the August 2013 Ghouta chemical attack, Syria, which had long been suspected of possessing chemical weapons, acknowledged them in September 2013 and agreed to put them under international supervision. On 14 September Syria deposited its instrument of accession to the CWC with the United Nations as the depositary and agreed to its provisional application pending entry into force effective 14 October. An accelerated destruction schedule was devised by Russia and the United States on 14 September, and was endorsed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 and the OPCW Executive Council Decision EC-M-33/DEC.1. Their deadline for destruction was the first half of 2014. Syria gave the OPCW an inventory of its chemical weapons arsenal and began its destruction in October 2013, 2 weeks before its formal entry into force, while applying the convention provisionally. All declared Category 1 materials were destroyed by August 2014. However, the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack in April 2017 indicated that undeclared stockpiles probably remained in the country. A chemical attack on Douma occurred on 7 April 2018 that killed at least 49 civilians with scores injured, and which has been blamed on the Assad government.\nControversy arose in November 2019 over the OPCW's finding on the Douma chemical weapons attack when Wikileaks published emails by an OPCW staff member saying a report on this incident \"misrepresents the facts\" and contains \"unintended bias\". The OPCW staff member questioned the report's finding that OPCW's inspectors had \"sufficient evidence at this time to determine that chlorine, or another reactive chlorine-containing chemical, was likely released from cylinders\". The staff member alleged this finding was \"highly misleading and not supported by the facts\" and said he would attach his own differing observations if this version of the report was released. On 25 November 2019, OPCW Director General Fernando Arias, in a speech to the OPCW's annual conference in The Hague, defended the Organization's report on the Douma incident, stating \"While some of these diverse views continue to circulate in some public discussion forums, I would like to reiterate that I stand by the independent, professional conclusion\" of the probe.\nFinancial support for destruction.\nFinancial support for the Albanian and Libyan stockpile destruction programmes was provided by the United States. Russia received support from a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Canada; with some $2 billion given by 2004. Costs for Albania's program were approximately US$48 million. As of 2007, the United States had spent $20 billion and expected to spend a further $40 billion.\nKnown chemical weapons production facilities.\nFourteen states parties declared chemical weapons production facilities (CWPFs):\nBy 31 December 2023, all 97 declared production facilities had been deactivated and certified as either destroyed (74) or converted (23) to civilian use.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Coyote\" animated shorts as a running gag. The company manufactures outlandish products that fail or backfire catastrophically at the worst possible times. The name is also used as a generic title in many cartoons, especially those made by , as well as films, TV series, commercials and comic strips.\nOrigin.\nThe word Acme comes from the Ancient Greek () meaning 'summit', 'highest point', 'extremity', or 'peak'. It has been claimed to be an acronym, either for \"A Company Making Everything\", \"American Companies Make Everything\", or \"American Company that Manufactures Everything\". During the 1920s, the word was commonly used in the names of businesses to be listed toward the beginning of alphabetized telephone directories like the Yellow Pages, and implied being the best. It is used in an ironic sense in cartoons, because the products are often failure-prone or explosive.\nThe name Acme began being depicted in film starting in the silent era, such as the 1920 \"Neighbors\" with Buster Keaton and the 1922 \"Grandma's Boy\" with Harold Lloyd, continuing with TV series, such as in early episodes of \"I Love Lucy\" and \"The Andy Griffith Show\", comic strips and cartoons, especially those made by , and commercials. It briefly appeared in the Walt Disney Donald Duck episodes \"Cured Duck\" released in 1945 and \"Three for Breakfast\" released in 1948. It also appears as the ACME Mining company owned by the villain Rod Lacy in the 1952 Western \"The Duel at Silver Creek\" and in a 1938 short \"Violent Is the Word for Curly\" in which The Three Stooges appear as gas station attendants at an \"Acme\" Service Station. It was also used in \"The Pink Panther Show\", in which the name Acme was used in several segments of the show's first episode in 1969, one of them being \"Pink Pest Control\".\nWarner Brothers animator Chuck Jones described the reason \"Acme\" was used in cartoons at the time:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Since we had to search out our own entertainment, we devised our own fairy stories. If you wanted a bow and arrow you got a stick. If you wanted to conduct an orchestra you got a stick. If you wanted a duel you used a stick. You couldn't go and buy one; that's where the term Acme came from. Whenever we played a game where we had a grocery store or something we called it the ACME corporation. Why? Because in the yellow pages if you looked, say, under drugstores, you'd find the first one would be Acme Drugs. Why? Because \"AC\" was about as high as you could go; it means the best; the superlative.\nWhistles and traffic lights.\nA whistle named \"Acme City\", made from the mid-1870s onward by J Hudson &amp; Co, followed by the \"Acme Thunderer\", and \"Acme siren\" in 1895, were the early brand names bearing the name with the word \"Acme\". At the time, the Acme Traffic Signal Company produced the traffic lights in Los Angeles, the city where Warner Bros. was making its cartoons. Instead of today's amber/yellow traffic light, bells rang as the small red and green lights with \"Stop\" and \"Go\" semaphore arms changed \u2014 a process that took five seconds.\nDepictions.\nIn film and TV.\nExamples that specifically reference the Wile E.

He was the son of Albrecht D\u00fcrer the Elder and the younger brother of Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Hans D\u00fcrer was previously a mine laborer as a result of losing a coin toss and agreeing to a pact to his brother, Albrecht D\u00fcrer. The pact was that the brother who lost the pact would financially help the winning brother's art academy fees for 4 years. Then the losing brother would then pursue art while the graduated brother would financially support the other brother. Hans lost this toss. Then while it was his turn, he couldn't go to art academy as his hand was too damaged and in bad condition after working in the mines. After a few years Hans' hand cured and became an artist.

Valens transformed the song into one with a rock rhythm and beat, and it became a hit in 1958, making Valens a pioneer of the Spanish-speaking rock and roll movement. He also had an American number-two hit with \"Donna\".\nOn February 3, 1959, on what has become known as \"The Day the Music Died\", Valens died in a plane crash in Iowa, an accident that also claimed the lives of fellow musicians Buddy Holly and J. P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson, as well as pilot Roger Peterson. Valens was 17 years old at the time of his death. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame, the California Hall of Fame, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nEarly life.\nValens was born as Richard Steven Valenzuela on May 13, 1941, in Pacoima, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles. The son of Joseph Steven Valenzuela (1896\u20131952) and Concepci\u00f3n \"Concha\" Reyes (1915\u20131987), he had two half-brothers, Robert \"Bob\" Morales (1937\u20132018) and Mario Ramirez, and two younger sisters, Connie and Irma. His parents were from the town of V\u00edcam, Sonora, and were both of Yaqui indigenous ancestry, having immigrated to the United States in search of a better life. Although Valenzuela is not a Yaqui surname, many indigenous families adopted it during the Porfiriato dictatorship to avoid forcible removal from their lands, similar to the case of Fernando Valenzuela, who was of Mayo ancestry.\nValenzuela was brought up hearing traditional Mexican mariachi music, as well as flamenco guitar, R&amp;B, and jump blues. He expressed an interest in making music of his own by the age of five. Valenzuela was encouraged by his father to take up guitar and trumpet, and later taught himself the drums. Though Valenzuela was left-handed, he was so eager to learn the guitar that he mastered the traditional right-handed version of the instrument.\nValenzuela was a 15-year-old student at Pacoima Junior High School at the time of the 1957 Pacoima mid-air collision. He was not at school that day since he was attending his grandfather's funeral. Recurring nightmares of the disaster led to Valens's fear of flying.\nBy the time Valenzuela was attending Pacoima Junior High School (now Pacoima Middle School), he would bring his guitar to school and sing and play songs to his friends on the bleachers. When Valenzuela was 16 years old, he was invited to join a local band, The Silhouettes (not to be confused with the group of the same name famous for its hit song \"Get a Job\"). Valenzuela began as a guitarist, and when the main vocalist left the group, he took over the position. On June 19, 1957, Valenzuela made his performing debut with The Silhouettes.\nValenzuela also attended San Fernando High School.\nCareer.\nA self-taught musician, Valenzuela was an accomplished singer and guitarist. At his appearances, Valenzuela often improvised new lyrics and added new riffs to popular songs while he was playing.\nBob Keane, the owner and president of small record label Del-Fi Records in Hollywood, was given a tip in May 1958 by San Fernando High School student Doug Macchia about a young performer from Pacoima by the name of Richard Valenzuela. Kids knew the performer as \"the Little Richard of San Fernando\". Swayed by the Little Richard comparison, Keane went to see Valenzuela play a Saturday-morning matin\u00e9e at a movie theater in San Fernando. Impressed by the performance, he invited Valenzuela to audition at his home in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles, where he had a small recording studio in his basement. His recording equipment comprised an early stereo recorder (a two-track Ampex 601-2 portable) and a pair of Neumann U-47 condenser microphones.\nAfter this first audition, Keane signed Valenzuela to Del-Fi on May 14, 1958. At this point, the musician took the name \"Ritchie\" because, as Keane said, \"There were a bunch of 'Richards' around at that time, and I wanted it to be different.\" Similarly, Keane recommended shortening his surname to \"Valens\" from Valenzuela to widen his appeal beyond any obvious ethnic group. Valens was ready to enter the studio with a full band backing him. The musicians included Ren\u00e9 Hall, Carol Kaye, and Earl Palmer. The first songs recorded at Gold Star Studios, at a single studio session one afternoon in May 1958, were \"Come On, Let's Go\", an original, credited to Valens/Kuhn (Keane's real name), and \"Framed\", a Leiber and Stoller tune. Pressed and released within days of the recording session, the record was a success. Valens' next record, a double A-side, had the song \"Donna\" (written about a real girlfriend Donna Ludwig) coupled with \"La Bamba\". It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America.\nBy the autumn of 1958, the demands of Valens's career forced him to drop out of high school. Keane booked appearances at venues across the United States and performances on television programs.\nConcerts and appearances (late 1958\u2013early 1959).\nOn October 6, 1958, Valens made his first appearance on Dick Clark's \"American Bandstand\" singing \"Come On, Let's Go\". Soon after, Valens traveled to Honolulu, Hawaii, to perform under the banner of the \"11th Show of Stars\". On December 10, 1958, after his trip to Honolulu, Valens made an appearance back at Pacoima Junior High School (now Pacoima Middle School). This concert was posthumously released as \"Ritchie Valens in Concert at Pacoima Jr. High\"; it was Valens' only live performance ever recorded. In mid-December 1958, Valens left for New York City. Keane had managed to book him as a late addition to \"Alan Freed's Christmas Jubilee Show\" where Valens performed with The Everly Brothers, Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Jackie Wilson, Eddie Cochran and others. On December 27, Valens performed \"Donna\" on \"The Dick Clark Show\". He played a few more shows in New York, including his only performance at the famous Apollo Theater. On January 17, 1959, he appeared at West Covina High School with Sam Cooke for a student organized fundraiser called \"The Teen Canteen Foundation\".\nPersonal life.\nValens was in a relationship with Donna Ludwig, his high school sweetheart, from 1957 until his death. Ludwig's parents disapproved of her dating a Hispanic boy. Valens's song \"Donna\" was written for her. Their relationship became strained due to Valens' increasing popularity and touring. After his death, Elvis Presley had one of his bodyguards arrange a date with Ludwig so that he could know all about Valens. In 1987, she attended the premiere of \"La Bamba\", a biopic featuring the life and career of Valens.\nWinter Dance Party tour and death (1959).\nValens was one of the five acts billed for the Winter Dance Party tour, performing with Buddy Holly, \"The Big Bopper\" J. P. Richardson, Dion and the Belmonts, and Frankie Sardo beginning on January 23, 1959, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The tour was plagued by subzero temperatures and numerous logistical problems. The unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with Valens and Richardson experiencing flu-like symptoms throughout the tour. After the bus stalled in Duluth, Minnesota on January 31, conditions were so bad that Holly's drummer, Carl Bunch, was hospitalized for severe frostbite sustained on the bus. To fill in for Bunch, Holly, Valens, and Carlo Mastrangelo of The Belmonts all took turns drumming for one another.\nAfter the February 2, 1959, performance in Clear Lake, Iowa (which ended around midnight), Holly, Richardson, and Valens flew out of the Mason City airport in a small plane that Holly had chartered. Valens was on the plane since he won a coin toss with Holly's backup guitarist Tommy Allsup. Bob Hale, a disc jockey with Mason City's KRIB-AM, was emceeing the concert that night and flipped the coin in the ballroom's side-stage room shortly before the musicians departed for the airport. Valens is apocryphally said to have remarked, \"That's the first time I've ever won anything in my life.\" Holly's bassist, Waylon Jennings, voluntarily gave up his seat on the plane to J.P. Richardson, who was ill with the flu. \nAt around 12:55\u00a0a.m. on February 3, 1959, the four-passenger Beechcraft Bonanza, (N3794N), departed for Fargo, North Dakota, and crashed a few minutes after takeoff. The cause was apparently loss of control by the pilot Roger Peterson, who was not qualified for the deteriorating weather. The crash killed all four men instantly upon impact. As with Holly, Richardson and Peterson, Valens suffered massive fatal head injuries along with blunt-force trauma to the chest. At the age of 17, Valens was the youngest to die in the crash.\nThe tragedy inspired singer Don McLean to write his 1971 hit \"American Pie\", immortalizing February 3 as \"The Day the Music Died\". Valens was buried at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California.\nLegacy.\nValens was a pioneer of Chicano rock and Latin rock, inspiring many musicians of Mexican heritage. He influenced the likes of Los Lobos, Los Lonely Boys, and Carlos Santana, as Valens had become nationally successful at a time when very few Latinos were in American rock and pop music. He is considered the first Latino to successfully cross over into mainstream rock.\n\"La Bamba\" proved to be his most influential recording, not only by becoming a pop chart hit sung entirely in Spanish, but also because of its successful blending of traditional Latin American music with rock. Valens was the first to capitalize on this formula, which was later adopted by such varied artists as Carlos Santana, Selena, Caifanes, Caf\u00e9 Tacuba, Circo, El Gran Silencio, Aterciopelados, Gustavo Santaolalla, and many others in the Latin alternative scene. The Valenzuela family spoke only English at home, and he knew very little Spanish. Valens learned the lyrics phonetically to record \"La Bamba\" in Spanish. In 2019, the Valens version of \"La Bamba\" was selected by the U.S. Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry as \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\".\nValens was nominated for a Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1988 for La Bamba.\nIn 2015, \"Billboard\" magazine listed Valens on its list of the 30 most influential Latino artists in history, citing \"the influence of the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer lives on in today's Latin alternative artists\" and also citing \"the pioneering Latino artists's enduring crossover hit \"La Bamba\" proved early on that Mexican-rooted music and Spanish lyrics appealed to the mainstream\".\n\"Come On, Let's Go\" has been recorded by Los Lobos, the Ramones and the Paley Brothers (the Ramones on guitar, bass, and drums and the Paley Brothers on vocals), Tommy Steele, the Huntingtons, Girl in a Coma, and the McCoys. Johnny Rebb and his Rebels recorded the song for Leedon/Canetoad Records in Australia. \"Donna\" has been recorded by artists as diverse as MxPx, Marty Wilde, the Youngbloods, Clem Snide, Cappadonna, and Misfits.\nRobert Quine has cited Valens's guitar playing as an early influence on his style. Valens also inspired Jimi Hendrix, Chan Romero, Carlos Santana, the Beatles, Chris Montez, Keith O'Conner Murphy, the Beach Boys and Led Zeppelin, among others.\nValens's mother, Concha, who died in 1987, is buried alongside him.\nTributes.\nIn 1989, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin fan of the 1950s era, erected a stainless-steel monument depicting a guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of each of the three performers killed in the accident. It is located on private farmland, about west of the intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue, about north of Clear Lake. He also created a similar stainless-steel monument to the three musicians that was installed near the Riverside Ballroom in Green Bay, Wisconsin. That memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003.\nPaxton Park in Pacoima was renamed Ritchie Valens Recreation Center in memory of Valens in the 1990s. There is also a pool nearby named the Ritchie Valens Pool. At the recreation center, there is also a skatepark named Ritchie Valens Skate Plaza. A city council member representing Pacoima proposed the renaming to honor Valens so residents would \"remember his humble background and emulate his accomplishments.\"\nMusician Tommy Allsup started a club, \"Tommy's Heads Up Saloon\", in Dallas in 1979. The club was named for the fateful coin toss between Valens and him twenty years prior.\n\"Boogie with Stu\" from Led Zeppelin's \"Physical Graffiti\" album was inspired by Valens' song \"Ooh, My Head\". It did not credit Valens or Bob Keane, instead crediting Valens' mother. Eventually, a lawsuit was filed by Keane, and half of the award went to Valens' mother, although she was not part of the suit.\nOn May 11, 1990, a star bearing Valens' name was unveiled on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star cost $3,500, which was paid for with money raised in his name by family and friends. His star permanently resides at 6733 Hollywood Boulevard in front of Artisan's Patio mini mall.\nOn February 2, 2009, Surf Ballroom held a 50th anniversary honoring the last concert of Buddy Holly, J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson, and Valens. The event lasted one week and had performances that honored the memories of the three men. Family members and friends of the stars made appearances.\nMany murals have been painted around Pacoima in honor of the late Valens.\nIn 1985, artist Manuel Velasquez (assisted by 25 students) created a mural, which was painted on the side of a classroom building at the former Pacoima Junior High (now Pacoima Middle School) depicting Valens's image, records labeled with some of his greatest hits, and the newspaper article about the plane crash that took his life.\nAnother mural went up in 2012 at the intersection of Van Nuys Boulevard and Amboy Avenue, which was painted by Hector Ponce. A second one was painted in 2012 by Levi Ponce and is located on Van Nuys Boulevard and Telfair Avenue. A monument has also been built as a tribute. It was put on display in 2013, and is located at Ritchie Valens Park at 10731 Laurel Canyon Boulevard.\nOn May 13, 2016, the 75th anniversary of Valens' birthday, the Los Angeles City Council declared May 13 \"Ritchie Valens Day\".\nA section of the Interstate 5 Freeway in the northeast San Fernando Valley has been named after Valens. The Ritchie Valens Memorial Highway is located between the 170 and 118 freeways. On August 25, 2018, a celebration was held in his honor to commemorate his legacy. The unveiling ceremony was held at Ritchie Valens Park, located at 10731 Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Pacoima. Replicas of the freeway sign were revealed at the celebration. The event was open to the public and free to attend. A few relatives of Valens played live performances as a tribute to the late singer. Leaders from the community and state gathered for the festivities.\nIn May 2022, the United States Post Office in Pacoima, California was renamed the Ritchie Valens Post Office in honor of Valens.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Styled as an anthropomorphic black duck, he has appeared in cartoon series such as \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\", in which he is usually depicted as a foil for either Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, or Speedy Gonzales. He was one of the first of the new \"screwball\" characters that emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier in the decade, such as Mickey Mouse, Porky Pig, and Popeye.\nDaffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age, making him the third-most frequent character in the \"Looney Tunes\"/\"Merrie Melodies\" cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny's 168 appearances and Porky Pig's 153 appearances. Virtually every Warner Bros. cartoon director, most notably Bob Clampett, Robert McKimson, and Chuck Jones, put his own spin on the Daffy Duck character.\nHe was ranked number 14 on \"TV Guide\"'s list of top 50 greatest cartoon characters.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nDaffy first appeared in \"Porky's Duck Hunt\", released on April 17, 1937. The cartoon was directed by Tex Avery and animated by Bob Clampett. \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" is a standard hunter/prey pairing, but Daffy (barely more than an unnamed bit player in this short) was something new to moviegoers: an assertive, completely unrestrained, combative protagonist. Clampett later recalled:\n \"At that time, audiences weren't accustomed to seeing a cartoon character do these things. And so, when it hit the theaters it was an explosion. People would leave the theaters talking about this daffy duck.\"\nThis early Daffy is less anthropomorphic and resembles a normal black duck. In fact, the only aspects of the character that have remained consistent through the years are his voice characterization by Mel Blanc; and his black feathers with a white neck ring. Blanc's characterization of Daffy once held the world record for the longest characterization of one animated character by their original actor: 52 years.\nThe origin of Daffy's voice, with its lateral lisp, is a matter of some debate. One often-repeated \"official\" story is that it was modeled after producer Leon Schlesinger's tendency to lisp. However, in Mel Blanc's autobiography, \"That's Not All Folks!\", he contradicts that conventional belief, writing, \"It seemed to me that such an extended mandible would hinder his speech, particularly on words containing an \"s\" sound. Thus 'despicable' became 'des\"th-\"picable.'\"\nDaffy's slobbery, exaggerated lisp was developed over time, and it is barely noticeable in the early cartoons.\nIn \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" (1950), Daffy has a middle name, Dumas as the writer of a swashbuckling script, a nod to Alexandre Dumas. Also, in the \"Baby Looney Tunes\" episode \"The Tattletale\", Granny addresses Daffy as \"Daffy Horatio Tiberius Duck\". In \"The Looney Tunes Show\" (2011), the joke middle names \"Armando\" and \"Sheldon\" are used.\nGolden Age Years.\nDaffy's early years, 1937\u20131940.\nTex Avery and Bob Clampett created the original version of Daffy in 1937. Daffy established his status by jumping into the water, hopping around, and yelling, \"Woo-hoo!\" Animator Bob Clampett immediately seized upon the Daffy Duck character and cast him in a series of cartoons in the 1930s and 1940s. The early Daffy is a wild and zany screwball, perpetually bouncing around the screen with cries of \"Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!\" (In his autobiography, Mel Blanc stated that the zany demeanor was inspired by Hugh Herbert's catchphrase, which was taken to a wild extreme for Daffy.)\nWorld War II Daffy, 1941\u20131945.\nDaffy would also feature in several war-themed shorts during World War II, remaining true to his unbridled nature. He battles a Nazi goat intent on eating Daffy's scrap metal in \"Scrap Happy Daffy\" (1943), hits Adolf Hitler's head with a giant mallet in \"Daffy the Commando\" (1943) and outwits Hitler, Goebbels and Goering in \"Plane Daffy\" (1944). Oddly enough, it was only after these wartime escapades that Daffy is actually subject to conscription into military service, in the form of \"the little man from the draft board\", whom he tries to dodge in \"Draftee Daffy\" (1945).\nEvolving \"Earlier\" Daffy 1946\u20131950.\nFor \"Daffy Doodles\" (his first \"Looney Tunes\" cartoon as a director), Robert McKimson tamed Daffy a bit, redesigning him yet again to be rounder and less elastic. The studio also instilled some of Bugs Bunny's savvy into the duck, making him as brilliant with his mouth as he was with his battiness. Daffy was teamed up with Porky Pig; the duck's one-time rival became his straight man. Arthur Davis, who directed Warner Bros. cartoon shorts for a few years in the late 1940s until upper management decreed there should be only three units (McKimson, Friz Freleng, and Jones), presented a Daffy similar to McKimson's. McKimson is noted as the last of the three units to make his Daffy uniform with Jones's, with even late shorts, such as \"Don't Axe Me\" (1958), featuring traits of the \"screwball\" Daffy. Starting in \"You Were Never Duckier\", Daffy's personality evolved to be less loony and more greedy.\nExperimenting with Daffy 1951\u20131964.\nWhile Daffy's looney days were over, McKimson continued to make him as bad or good as his various roles required him to be. McKimson would often have Daffy play the role of a salesman who pushes a potential customer into buying something, such as \"Fool Coverage\" (1952) where Daffy succeeds in selling Porky Pig a $1,000,000 accident policy which only works under impossible conditions (which, unfortunately for Daffy, all occur), and \"The High and the Flighty\" (1956) where Daffy intervenes in Foghorn Leghorn and the Barnyard Dawg's usual antics by selling them novelty joke items to get back at each other. His marks eventually catch on and team up against Daffy to trap him in one of the prank kits he sold to them. McKimson would use this version of Daffy from 1946 to 1961. However, even McKimson would follow in Jones' footsteps in many aspects with cartoons like \"People Are Bunny\" (1959) and \"Ducking the Devil\" (1957). Friz Freleng's version took a hint from Chuck Jones by making the duck more sympathetic, as in \"Show Biz Bugs\" (1957). Here, Daffy is overemotional and jealous of Bugs, yet he has real talent that is ignored by the theater manager and the crowd. This cartoon finishes with a sequence in which Daffy attempts to wow the Bugs-besotted audience with an act in which he drinks gasoline and swallows nitroglycerine, gunpowder, and uranium-238 (in a greenish solution), jumps up and down to \"shake well\" and finally swallows a lit match that detonates the whole improbable mixture. When Bugs tells Daffy that the audience loves the act and wants more, Daffy, now a ghost floating upward (presumably to Heaven), says that he can only do the act once. Some TV stations, and in the 1990s the cable network TNT, edited out the dangerous act, afraid of imitation by young children.\nPairing of Daffy and Porky in parodies of popular movies, 1951\u20131965.\nWhile Bugs Bunny became Warner Bros.' most popular character, the directors still found ample use for Daffy. Several cartoons place him in parodies of popular movies and radio serials; Porky Pig was usually a comic relief sidekick. For example, Daffy in \"The Great Piggy Bank Robbery\" (1946) as \"Duck Twacy\" (Dick Tracy) by Bob Clampett; in \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" (1950), Daffy was the hero and Porky Pig was the villain. \"Drip-Along Daffy\" (1951), named after the Hopalong Cassidy character, throws Daffy into a Western with him labeled \"Western-Type Hero\" and Porky Pig labeled \"Comedy Relief\". In \"Duck Dodgers in the 24\u00bdth Century\" (1953), a parody of \"Buck Rogers\", Daffy trades barbs (and bullets) with Marvin the Martian, with Porky Pig retaining the role of Daffy's sidekick. In \"Rocket Squad\" (1956), a parody of \"Dragnet\" and \"Racket Squad\", Daffy and Porky Pig pair up once again. Daffy also played \"Stupor Duck\", a parody of the \"Adventures of Superman\" television series. \"Robin Hood Daffy\" (1958) casts the duck in the role of the legendary outlaw Robin Hood with Porky Pig as Friar Tuck. \"China Jones\" (1959) named after China Smith, has Daffy in Hong Kong playing the role of a private investigator.\nPairing of Bugs and Daffy, 1951\u20131964.\nBugs's ascension to stardom also prompted the Warner Bros. animators to recast Daffy as the rabbit's rival, intensely jealous, insecure and determined to steal back the spotlight, while Bugs either remained cool headed but mildly amused and/or indifferent to the duck's jealousy, sometimes using it to his advantage. Daffy's desire to achieve stardom at almost any cost was explored as early as 1940 in Freleng's \"You Ought to Be in Pictures\", but the idea was most successfully used by Chuck Jones, who redesigned the duck once again, making him scrawnier and scruffier. In Jones' \"Hunting Trilogy\" (or \"Duck Season/Rabbit Season Trilogy\") of \"Rabbit Fire\", \"Rabbit Seasoning\" and \"Duck! Rabbit, Duck!\" (each respectively launched in 1951, 1952, and 1953), Daffy's attention-grabbing ways and excitability provide Bugs Bunny the perfect opportunity to fool the hapless Elmer Fudd into repeatedly shooting the duck's bill off. Also, these cartoons reveal Daffy's catchphrase, \"Youuu're deththpicable!\". Jones' Daffy sees himself as self-preservationist, not selfish. However, this Daffy can do nothing that does not backfire on him, more likely to singe his tail feathers as well as his ego and pride than anything. It is thought that Chuck Jones based Daffy Duck's new personality on his fellow animator Bob Clampett, who, like Daffy, was known as a loud self-promoter. In \"Beanstalk Bunny\" Daffy, Bugs and Elmer are once again teamed up in a parody of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" (with Elmer as the giant); in \"A Star Is Bored\" Daffy tries to upstage Bugs Bunny. In the spoofs of the TV shows \"The Millionaire\" and \"This Is Your Life\", Daffy tries to defeat his arch-rival Bugs Bunny for a $1,000,000.00 prize given out by his favorite TV show in \"The Million Hare\" and in \"This Is a Life?\", Daffy tries to upstage Bugs Bunny in order to be the guest of honor on the show; in all four of these cartoons Daffy ends up a loser because of his own overemotional personality (which impairs Daffy's common sense and reasoning ability) and his craving for attention. By Daffy's own admission he is extremely greedy: \"I can't help it, I'm a greedy slob. It's my hobby!\" \"Ali Baba Bunny\" (1957) and \"I may be a coward, but I'm a greedy little coward\" \"Ducking the Devil\" (1957).\nSolo Daffy.\nFilm critic Steve Schneider calls Jones' version of Daffy \"a kind of unleashed id.\" Jones said that his version of the character \"expresses all of the things we're afraid to express.\" This is evident in Jones' \"Duck Amuck\" (1953), \"one of the few unarguable masterpieces of American animation\" according to Schneider. In the episode, Daffy is plagued by a godlike animator whose malicious paintbrush alters the setting, soundtrack, and even Daffy. When Daffy demands to know who is responsible for the changes, the camera pulls back to reveal none other than Bugs Bunny. \"Duck Amuck\" is widely heralded as a classic of filmmaking for its illustration that a character's personality can be recognized independently of appearance, setting, voice, and plot. In 1999, the short was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nDaffy's pairing with Speedy in 1965\u20131968.\nWhen the Warner Bros. animation studio briefly outsourced cartoon production to DePatie-Freleng Enterprises (DFE) in the 1960s, Daffy Duck became an antagonist in several cartoons opposite Speedy Gonzales, who refers to Daffy as \"the loco duck.\" In \"Well Worn Daffy\" (1965), Daffy is determined to keep the mice away from a desperately needed well seemingly for no other motive than pure maliciousness. Furthermore, when he draws all the water he wants, Daffy then attempts to destroy the well in spite of the vicious pointlessness of the act, forcing Speedy to stop him. The Warner Bros. studio was entering its twilight years, and even Daffy had to stretch for humor in the period. In many of the later DFE cartoons, such as \"Feather Finger\" and \"Daffy's Diner\", Daffy is portrayed as a more sympathetic character (often forced to turn against Speedy at the behest of a common enemy) rather than the full-blown villain he is in cartoons like \"Assault and Peppered\". The last cartoon featuring Daffy and Speedy is \"See Ya Later Gladiator\", in what animation fans call the worst cartoon made by Warner Bros.\n\"The Daffy Duck Show\".\nIn light of the longstanding popularity of \"The Bugs Bunny Show\" and its various incarnations on CBS and ABC, NBC commissioned their own half-hour series, \"The Daffy Duck Show\", which began airing in the fall of 1978. While some well-known titles were included in the program, most of the cartoons featured on the series were from the late '60s Depatie-Freleng run. The program ran on NBC for two years, then in 1981 was rechristened \"The Daffy/Speedy Show\" and ran for another two years. Eventually, NBC canceled the series, and many of the cartoons were reintegrated into the lineups for the respective CBS and ABC \"Bugs Bunny\" shows.\nMore recent years.\nDaffy appeared in later cartoons. He was one of many \"Looney Tunes\" characters allowed by Warner Bros. to appear in the 1988 Disney/Amblin film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\". In the film, Daffy (utilizing his original, wacky characterization) shares a scene with his Disney counterpart Donald Duck whilst performing in a piano duel. He was animated by Dave Spafford. In 1987, to celebrate Daffy's 50th anniversary, Warner Bros. released \"The Duxorcist\" as its first theatrical \"Looney Tunes\" short in two decades. Daffy Duck also appeared in several feature-film compilations, including two films centered around himself. The first was released in 1983, \"Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island\"; the second came in 1988, \"Daffy Duck's Quackbusters\", which is considered one of the \"Looney Tunes best compilation films and featured another new theatrical short, \"The Night of the Living Duck\". Daffy has also had major roles in films such as \"Space Jam\" in 1996 and ' in 2003. The latter film does much to flesh out his character, even going so far as to cast a sympathetic light on Daffy's glory-seeking ways in one scene, where he complains that he works tirelessly without achieving what Bugs does without even trying. That same year, Warner Bros. cast him in a brand-new \"Duck Dodgers\" series. (It should be stressed that in this show, Duck Dodgers actually is Daffy Duck due to him being frozen in suspended animation in some unknown incident.) He had a cameo appearance in \"The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries\" episode \"When Granny Ruled the Earth\", first airing on March 27, 1999. Daffy has also been featured in several webtoons, which can be viewed online.\nDaffy has also made appearances on numerous television series. In \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", Daffy is a teacher at Acme Looniversity, where he is the hero and mentor of student Plucky Duck. He is shown as a baby in \"Baby Looney Tunes\", and appears to have a similar personality to his earlier years with his rivalry with Bugs and saying, \"Woo-hoo!\" often in the show. He made occasional cameo appearances on \"Animaniacs\" and \"Histeria!\". In \"Loonatics Unleashed\", his descendant is Danger Duck (voiced by Jason Marsden), whom his teammates consider lame and unpopular. A majority of these appearances try to emulate Chuck Jones' incarnation of the character.\nDaffy has also been given larger roles in more recent \"Looney Tunes\" films and series. Following \"Looney Tunes: Back in Action\", Warner Bros. has slowly moved the spotlight away from Bugs and more towards Daffy, as shown in the 2006 direct-to-video movie \"Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas\", where Daffy plays the lead, while Bugs appears in a minor supporting role.\nHowever, more recent merchandise of the duck, as well as that featured on the official website, have been shown to incorporate elements of the zanier, more light-hearted Daffy of the 1930s and 1940s. Producer Larry Doyle noted that recent theatrical cartoons were planned that would portray a more diverse Daffy closer to that of Robert McKimson's design; however, due to the box office bomb of \"Looney Tunes: Back in Action\", these new films ceased production.\nDaffy returned to Cartoon Network in \"The Looney Tunes Show\", voiced by Jeff Bergman. In the show, he has moved out of the forest and shares Bugs' house with him. Unlike Bugs and their neighbors, Daffy has no way of earning money and relies on Bugs for food and shelter. He tried on numerous occasions to get rich quick, but ended up failing repeatedly. Daffy's one possession he is proud of is his paper-mache parade float, constructed on top of a flatbed truck, which is his main means of transportation. While Daffy's greed and jealousy of Bugs remains, he appears to be less antagonistic in this show, as Bugs even tells Daffy in spite of his faults, he is Bugs' best friend and vice versa. Daffy serves as a sort of mentor to Gossamer. Daffy has difficulty telling fiction from reality; he often confuses television shows for his own life, believes Bugs is Superman, and at one point hallucinates he is a wizard.\nDaffy starred in the 3-D short \"Daffy's Rhapsody\" with Elmer Fudd that was originally set to premiere before \"Happy Feet Two\" but instead debuted prior to \"\". The short features Daffy and Elmer in the first CG or 3-D depiction of these specific \"Looney Tunes\" characters. According to Matthew O'Callaghan, who directed the short, the audio comes from a 1950s recording for a children's album. Daffy is performing in a hunting musical, when Elmer, who is in the audience, pursues him. Daffy is initially unaware of the danger, but quickly realizes the threat Elmer poses and outwits him by using the props against him.\nDaffy appeared in the 2015 DTV movie \"\".\nDaffy appears in the Cartoon Network series \"New Looney Tunes\" where he is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. Daffy is often paired with Porky where Daffy will annoy and bedevil the pig, though occasionally Porky one ups Daffy.\nDaffy appears in \"Looney Tunes Cartoons\", where he is voiced by Eric Bauza.\nDaffy appears in the preschool series \"Bugs Bunny Builders\" which currently airs on Cartoon Network's Cartoonito block and HBO Max. Eric Bauza reprises his role.\nDaffy stars alongside Porky Pig in \"\", both being voiced by Eric Bauza. Here, as the duo try to save their childhood home, Daffy stumbles upon an alien mind-control plot, determined to stop it alongside Porky and Petunia Pig.\nComics.\nDell Comics published several Daffy Duck comic books, beginning in \"Four Color Comics\" #457, #536, and #615 and then continuing as \"Daffy\" #4-17 (1956\u201359), then as \"Daffy Duck\" #18-30 (1959\u201362). The comic book series was subsequently continued in Gold Key Comics \"Daffy Duck\" #31-127 (1962\u201379). This run was in turn continued under the Whitman Comics imprint until the company completely ceased comic book publication in 1984. In 1994, corporate cousin DC Comics became the publisher for comics featuring all the classic Warner Bros. cartoon characters, and while not getting his own title, Daffy has appeared in many issues of \"Looney Tunes\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power, and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character. Even after he was supplanted by later characters, Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and, more importantly, the Warners directors, who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles.\nHe is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts, \"(stutter) that's all, folks!\" This slogan (without stuttering) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons. Porky is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character.\nPorky's most distinctive trait is a severe stutter, for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words; for example, \"What's going on?\" might become \"What's guh-guh-guh-guh\u2014...what's happening?\" Porky's age varied widely in the series; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet (explicitly mentioned as such in \"Porky's Preview\"), Porky was more frequently cast as an adult, often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years. At the ending of many \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons, Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head and says \"Th-Th... That's all, folks!\" Porky Pig appeared in 153 cartoons in the golden age of American animation.\nEarly films.\nThe character was introduced in the 100th short, \"I Haven't Got a Hat\" (released on March 2, 1935), directed by Friz Freleng. Studio head Leon Schlesinger suggested that Freleng do a cartoon version of the popular \"Our Gang\" films. Porky only has a minor role in the film, but the fat little stuttering pig quickly became popular. Porky's name came from two brothers who were childhood classmates of Freleng, nicknamed \"Porky\" and \"Piggy\".\nSince Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising had left the studio in 1933, taking the studio's star character Bosko with them, \"Looney Tunes\" had been kept afloat by cartoons featuring the bland Buddy. Porky's introduction ushered Buddy out the door and pointed to things to come. Tex Avery was hired by the studio in 1935, and his film \"Gold Diggers of '49\" reused much of the cast from \"I Haven't Got a Hat\", albeit in wildly different roles. Porky transitioned from a shy little boy to an immensely fat adult. Though he was still in a supporting role, Porky got most of the laughs. The directors realized they had a star on their hands.\nPorky shared his stutter with the voice actor who originally played him, Joe Dougherty, who was actually a person who stuttered. Because Dougherty could not control his stutter, however, production costs became too high as his recording sessions took hours, and Porky's additional lines were done by Count Cutelli. Mel Blanc replaced Dougherty in 1937. Blanc continued the stutter; however, it was harnessed for a more precise comedic effect (such as stumbling over a simple word only to substitute a longer word without difficulty, or vice versa). This is parodied in \"A Connecticut Rabbit in King Arthur's Court\", where Bugs Bunny struggles to pronounce the word \"porcupine\", which Porky pronounces with no trouble.\n\"Porky's Duck Hunt\" was released in 1937, and Blanc officially became the permanent voice of Porky until his death in 1989. In later interviews, Blanc often said that he intended Porky's stutter to be suggestive of the grunting of actual pigs. \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" was also the first film of another Looney Tunes star, Daffy Duck. Porky Pig is currently voiced by Bob Bergen and Eric Bauza.\nClampett's Porky.\nPorky starred in dozens of films in the late 1930s. The directors still did not have a grasp on the character, however; his appearance, age, and personality all varied from picture to picture. Several such cartoons show Porky as a child with parents: father Phineas (\"Porky the Rainmaker\", \"Milk and Money\", \"Porky's Poppa\", and \"Porky and Teabiscuit\") and an unnamed mother (\"Wholly Smoke\" and \"Porky's Hero Agency\"). Bob Clampett finally pinned Porky down in 1939, making him a permanent young adult: cuter, slimmer, smarter, and eventually less of a stutterer. Also, some cartoons show Porky as an antagonist (\"Porky's Duck Hunt\", \"Porky's Hare Hunt\", \"My Favorite Duck\", \"A Corny Concerto\", \"Duck Soup to Nuts\", \"Daffy Doodles\", \"Daffy Duck Hunt\", \"Boobs in the Woods\", \"Thumb Fun\" and \"Cracked Quack\"). Eventually, he settled into a kind persona. Clampett's Porky was an innocent traveler, taking in the world's wonders\u2014and in Clampett's universe, the world is a very weird place. This principle is perhaps best demonstrated in \"Porky in Wackyland\", a film that sends Porky on a quest to find the last of the surreal Dodos, Yoyo Dodo. \"Porky in Wackyland\" was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry in 2000.\nIn his commentary as part of the 1970s documentary film \"\", Clampett said that his early version of Tweety had to be redesigned after his first picture because the producers thought he \"looked naked\". Meanwhile, as Clampett noted, nothing was ever made of the fact that \"all those years, Porky never wore any pants!\" However, Porky was seen with pants in \"Porky's Badtime Story\", \"Tick Tock Tuckered\" and \"Brother Brat\".\nAs a sidekick.\nPorky's post at the pinnacle of the Warners' pantheon was short-lived. In 1937, the studio tried pairing Porky with various sidekicks, such as love interest Petunia Pig, cantankerous foil Gabby Goat, a manic white hare that would eventually evolve into Bugs Bunny, and a screwy black duck, Daffy. Daffy Duck, the creation of Tex Avery, was by far the most popular in this role, eventually outshining even Porky. In fact, Friz Freleng satirized this phenomenon when he directed \"You Ought to Be in Pictures\" (1940), where Daffy convinces Porky to quit his job at Warner Bros. to find better-paying work elsewhere. Porky then convinces studio head Leon Schlesinger to release him from his contract. After a highly unsuccessful foray into the real world, Porky returns happily to the studio that created him. To this day, Porky remains as a loyal sidekick while Daffy refuses to be a second banana to Bugs, who eventually became Warners' signature character.\nPorky always remained a sentimental favorite of the Warner directors. His mild-mannered nature and shy demeanor made him the perfect straight man for zanier characters such as Daffy. He still starred in a few solo cartoons as well, such as Frank Tashlin's \"Brother Brat\". Other cartoons dumbed Porky down and cast him as a duck hunter after Daffy, largely paralleling the Elmer Fudd/Bugs Bunny pairings. Chuck Jones perfected the Porky-as-straight man scenarios, pairing the pig with Daffy Duck in a series of film and television parodies such as \"Drip-Along Daffy\", \"Duck Dodgers in the 24\u00bdth Century\", \"Rocket Squad\", \"Deduce, You Say!\", \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" and \"Robin Hood Daffy\". Jones also paired Porky with Sylvester in a series of cartoons in the late 1940s and early 1950s, in which Porky plays the curmudgeonly and naive owner of the cat and remains clueless that Sylvester is constantly saving him from homicidal mice, space aliens and other threats.\nLater years.\nPorky was used in regular rotation in television syndication beginning in the 1960s, as were the rest of his \"Looney Tunes\" co-stars. A Saturday morning cartoon, \"The Porky Pig Show\", ran from 1964 to 1967. In 1971, he starred in another show, \"Porky Pig and Friends\". Both of these programs were collections of old theatrical shorts. Porky also appeared in all the classic film-feature compilations in the 1970s and 1980s. Another such collection was the 1986 film, \"Porky Pig in Hollywood\", which ran in art and college theaters.\nPorky made an appearance in the Touchstone/Amblin film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988) at the end of the film where he, being paired with Disney's Tinkerbell, closes the movie with his famous line \"Th-Th-Th-That's All Folks!\". It was the last time that Mel Blanc voiced Porky before his death in 1989.\nIn the 1990s animated series \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", Porky appears as the mentor of Hamton J. Pig. He was voiced by Bob Bergen in \"Animaniacs\" and \"Hero Hamton\", Rob Paulsen in \"The Wacko World of Sports\", Noel Blanc in \"Fields of Honey\", \"The Acme Bowl\" and \"Hero Hamton\", Joe Alaskey in \"Music Day\", and Greg Burson in \"It's a Wonderful Tiny Toons Christmas Special\". Porky also made cameo appearances in \"Animaniacs\" (where he was voiced by Rob Paulsen in \"De-Zanitized\", Greg Burson in \"The Warners' 65th Anniversary Special\", and Bob Bergen in \"Suffragette City\") and \"Histeria!\" (where he was voiced by Billy West).\nPorky appears in the movie \"Space Jam\" (1996) and collaborates with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, and Sylvester in challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. He tries to get Michael Jordan's autograph when the basketball star is first recruited to join the team and later plays for the Tune Squad in the game itself, scoring one basket. Porky tries to end the movie with his famous line but is prevented by the combined efforts of Bugs, Daffy, and the Nerdlucks. He was voiced by Bob Bergen.\nPorky is the star of the Super NES video game \"Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday\" (1995). He also made appearances in the games ', ', ', ', \"Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage\" and \"The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout\". Bob Bergen reprises his role in these games.\nIn the movie \"\" (2003), Porky (Bob Bergen again) makes a cameo appearance alongside Speedy Gonzales, where they both lament their politically incorrect status. At the end of the movie, Porky tries to say his classic line, but stutters so much, the lights are turned off around him as the studio closes for the night; so an irritated Porky simply says, \"G-g-go home, folks.\"\nPorky appears as a toddler version of himself in \"Baby Looney Tunes\" (2002), albeit only in the show's musical numbers. Petunia functioned as the show's more major pig character.\nPorky appears as the \"Eager Young Space Cadet\" in the animated series \"Duck Dodgers\" (2003\u20132005), again voiced by Bob Bergen.\nPorky has a descendant in \"Loonatics Unleashed\" (2005\u20132007) named Pinkster Pig (who was also voiced by Bob Bergen). Pinkster had been an old friend of Danger Duck (Daffy Duck's descendant), but became a villain when he was adopted by Stoney and Bugsy (descendants of Rocky and Mugsy).\nPorky also appears in most episodes of Cartoon Network's animated series \"The Looney Tunes Show\" (2011\u20132014), voiced again by Bob Bergen. He is still friends with Daffy Duck and often sucked into Daffy's schemes. Porky is also Daffy's nervous, fall guy buddy, similar to their relationship in classic comic books. It is also revealed in the show that in his high school years, he was a jock who bullied Daffy, while during their childhood years, it was Daffy who bullied Porky.\nIn the documentary \"I Know That Voice\" (2013), Bob Bergen explains how to recreate the pig's famous stutter, demonstrating how difficult it is to do it without practice. He finishes the segment by joking \"Nobody [else] can do that, and that's why I have job security!\"\nPorky appears in the direct-to-video movie \"\" (2015), reprised by Bob Bergen.\nPorky Pig appears as a recurring character in \"New Looney Tunes\" (2015\u20132020), voiced again by Bob Bergen. Here, he is shown to be fatter, like some of his earlier appearances in the mid-1930s. Porky was first mentioned in \"Dust Bugster\", where he told Bugs about a television series whose name was not mentioned that led to Bugs binge-watching it.\nA humanoid version of Porky also appeared in Tom King's \"Batman/Elmer Fudd Special\", where he ran a bar called Porky's which often featured attendants that were humanoid versions of other Looney Tunes characters. The bar and Porky also made a cameo in Tom King's \"Batman\" series.\nIn the 2018 DC Comics and Looney Tunes comic crossovers, Porky appeared in a story that paired him with Lex Luthor. This version of Porky was the successful owner of a company named Porkybux before it was hacked and ran him out of business. He is later approached by Lex to be in charge of LexCorp's social media division and lets Lex get away with harassing his employees and stealing their sandwiches as repayment for the second chance. It is later revealed that Lex gave him the position to frame Porky when he used his social media website to steal important passwords from their users. Porky begins an autobiography in prison to expose Lex for his actions. In the backup story stylized more like Looney Tunes, Porky tries selling Acme office supplies to Lex but ends up stopping Lex from defeating Superman.\nPorky appears in \"Looney Tunes Cartoons\" (2020\u20132024), where he is again voiced by Bob Bergen. His personality is based on the earlier shorts, however, his appearance is based on later shorts like \"The Looney Tunes Show\" for example. He is mostly paired with Daffy Duck who always drives him crazy.\nPorky appears in the movie \"\" (2021), voiced by Eric Bauza. Here, he collaborates with other Looney Tunes and LeBron James in challenging the \"Goon Squad\" to a basketball game in the \"Warner Bros. Serververse\".\nPorky appears in the preschool series \"Bugs Bunny Builders\" (2022\u2013present) which aired on Cartoon Network's Cartoonito block and HBO Max, where he is voiced by Bob Bergen, reprising his role from \"Looney Tunes Cartoons\".\nPorky appears in the \"Teen Titans Go!\" episode, \"Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary\". He is among the Looney Tunes characters guests for the Warner Bros. centennial celebration, voiced once again by Bob Bergen.\nPorky stars alongside Daffy Duck in \"\" (2024), voiced by Eric Bauza, reprising the role from \"Space Jam: A New Legacy\". Here, he teams up with Daffy and Petunia against an alien mind-control plot the former uncovers.\n\"Blooper\".\nA short black-and-white cartoon was made in 1938 as part of a Warner Bros. blooper reel. It was shown on the Warner Bros. 50th Anniversary TV show. Porky is shown doing some carpentry work, pounding nails, when he smacks his thumb with the hammer. Grimacing in pain, he cries, \"Oh, son of a bi-bi-, son of a bi-bi-, son of a bi-bi-bi-... gun!\" He then turns to the viewers and says \"Ha-ha-ha! You thought I was gonna say 's-s-son of a bitch', didn't ya?\"\nThis short, so-called \"blooper\" can also be found on the \"\" of 2006, under the title \"Porky Pig Breakdowns of 1939\" (with several versions of the clip, making it look like a true \"blooper\"), and on an \"Each Dawn I Die\" DVD box set, also released in 2006. Though the \"blooper\" was made a year before \"Gone with the Wind\" famously used the word in the line \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn\", due to the Motion Picture Production Code the \"blooper\" was not shown publicly until the aforementioned special, which by that point FCC regulations softened enough for the word \"bitch\" to be used on television. The blooper was also shown as part of a package of other vintage bloopers on Warner Cable pay-per-view in the 80s. The blooper was animated by Rod Scribner.\nReception.\nPorky was ranked number 47 on \"TV Guide\"'s list of top 50 cartoon characters. He was shown on one of that issue's two covers in a crossover scene with Duck Dodgers and \"The Powerpuff Girls\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "51851", "revid": "44313162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51851", "title": "Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party", "text": "24-member leading body of the Chinese Communist Party\nThe Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, officially the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, is the executive committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Currently, the bureau is a group of 24 top officials who oversee the party and central government. The politburo is headed by the general secretary. Unlike the politburos of other communist parties, the CCP Politburo subdelegates many of its powers to the smaller Politburo Standing Committee.\nThe Politburo is elected by the Central Committee. In practice, however, scholars of Chinese elite politics believe that the Politburo is a self-perpetuating body, with new members of both the Politburo and its Standing Committee chosen through a series of deliberations by current Politburo members and retired Politburo Standing Committee members. The current and former Politburo members conduct a series of informal straw polls to determine the group's level of support for each new candidate's membership in the Politburo. The process for selecting the new Politburo begins with a closed door meeting by the incumbent Politburo Standing Committee in Beidaihe in the summer before the National Congress of the CCP convenes.\nThe power of the Politburo resides largely in the fact that its members generally simultaneously hold positions within the People's Republic of China state positions and with the control over personnel appointments that the Politburo and Secretariat have. In addition, some Politburo members hold powerful regional positions. How the Politburo works internally is unclear, but it appears that the full Politburo meets once a month and the standing committee meets weekly. This is believed to be much less frequent than meetings of the former Soviet Politburo. The agenda for the meetings is controlled by the CCP general secretary and decisions are made by consensus rather than by majority vote.\nHistory.\nThe Politburo was eclipsed by the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party in the early 1980s under Hu Yaobang, but has re-emerged as a dominant force after Hu's ousting in 1987.\nComposition and selection.\nSince the 1990s, Politburo members concurrently held posts in the party apparatus, in state posts, and as regional party chiefs. Some are party secretaries of important provinces or municipalities.57 In addition, members serving in the military and security sectors have been limited to 3 posts. In contrast, most members in the 1980s had a military command background. In 2017, for the 19th Central Committee Politburo, aside from the heads of the four main institutional hierarchies\u2014the CCP, the National People's Congress, the State Council and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, there were six members each holding posts in the party, the national government, the regional governments, and three in the military. The average age of the 2017 Politburo's members was 62, which was similar to those in recent decades. Before that, the Party under Deng Xiaoping deliberately encouraged turnover by imposing term limits and retirement ages.\nSince the 17th National Congress, the official way of electing the Politburo was through a process called \"democratic recommendation\" () where the CCP conducted a straw poll of 200 candidates to the Politburo, which were factored into the final list of candidates presented at the National Congress of the CCP. However, this was abolished in the 19th National Congress under Xi, which denounced the \"vote buying\" and voting \"based on personal connections and favors\" of this method, particularly in connection to politicians who fell after the anti-corruption campaign under Xi. The process was officially replaced with a method of \"face-to-face interviews, investigation and study\".\nCurrent composition.\nThe 20th Politburo was elected at the first plenary session of the 20th Central Committee in October 2022. Xi Jinping\u2019s persistence in his third five-year term represents a departure from the pattern of decade-long reigns for leaders, such as Mao and Deng.\nCadre training.\nIn 2001, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party published the \"2001-2005 National Plan for Cadre Training\" elevating the importance of cadre training for the reform and opening up. The salaries of staff in party schools were brought in line with the salaries paid in regular Chinese universities. Teaching, research, and information technology was modernized to enable distance education throughout the party school system.47 \nModern cadre training focuses on \"quality\" and \"ability\". Students are trained in ideological orthodoxy, submitting to Leninism and party discipline. The young cadre is trained in applying their knowledge creatively and independently, so as to deal flexibly with complex issues and accept continuous learning.50 The initiative for cadre training after 2002 was buttressed by the Central Party School, and the regional party schools, including the Party Schools in Shanghai and Shenzhen.51\nFunctions.\nThe Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee are the top decision-making institutions for the CCP Central Committee. According to the CCP constitution, the party's Central Committee elects the Politburo during a plenary session. Members of the Politburo are deputy-national-level leaders or more.\nA Politburo meeting in October 2017 after the first plenary session of the 19th CCP Central Committee stipulated that all Politburo members must make an annual written presentation to the CCP General Secretary and the Central Committee. It also stipulated the CCP Secretariat, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Leading Party Members Group of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Leading Party Members Group of the State Council, the Leading Party Members Group of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Leading Party Members Group of the Supreme People's Court and the Leading Party Members Group of the Supreme People's Procuratorate must report their work to the Politburo and its Standing Committee every year. In March 2018, all Standing Committee members and members of the Politburo made their first written presentation to the Central Committee and General Secretary Xi Jinping.\nPolitburo meetings.\nThe Politburo typically meets once a month.57 The General Secretary of the Central Committee is responsible for convening the meetings of the Politburo and decides their agenda. The CCP almost always releases a readout to summarize the outcomes of Politburo meetings and, since 2002, these sessions have been widely publicized. Frequently, they address foreign affairs.\nSince 2002, the Politburo has regularly held collective study sessions and more standard Politburo meetings. The standard meetings discuss new policy directives, provide feedback on policy implementation and prepare for future work conferences, plenums, or congresses. The collective study sessions serve as an opportunity for CCP leadership to promote new policies. They generally take place shortly after the standard meetings, usually on the same day or the day after. The Politburo invites professors, think tank scholars or other experts to give a lecture to the Politburo members about a topic chosen by the General Secretary. These lectures often end with \"work recommendations\" for the Politburo and conclude with a speech by the General Secretary on the study topic. The collective study sessions are often publicized and play an important role to signal leadership priorities to cadres.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Usually constructed of concrete, pavers, brick, stone, or asphalt, it is designed for pedestrians. A sidewalk is normally higher than the roadway, and separated from it by a curb. There may also be a planted strip between the sidewalk and the roadway and between the roadway and the adjacent land.\nTerminology.\nThe preferred term for a pedestrian path beside a road varies based on region.\nThe term \"sidewalk\" is preferred in most of the United States and Canada.\nThe term \"pavement\" is more common in the United Kingdom\n and some other members of the Commonwealth of Nations, as well as parts of the Mid-Atlantic United States such as Philadelphia and parts of New Jersey.\nAustralia, New Zealand, and many other Commonwealth countries use the term \"footpath\".\nIn the United States, the term \"sidewalk\" is used for the pedestrian path beside a road. \"Shared use paths\" or \"multi-use paths\" are available for use by both pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\"Walkway\" is a more comprehensive term that includes stairs, ramps, passageways, and related structures that facilitate the use of a path as well as the sidewalk.\nIn the UK, the term \"footpath\" is mostly used for paths that do not abut a roadway.\nThe term \"shared-use path\" is used where cyclists are also able to use the same section of path as pedestrians.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the term 'footpath' is used for all pedestrian paths, whether or not it runs alongside the road.\nA 'shared path' (or 'shared-use path') is a 'paved area particularly designed...for the movement of cyclists and pedestrians', and 'pavement' is the 'portion of a road designed for the support of...vehicular traffic'.\nHistory.\nSidewalks have operated for at least 4,000 years.\nThe Greek city of Corinth had sidewalks by the 4th-century BC, and the Romans built sidewalks \u2013 they called them \"s\u0113mitae\".\nHowever, by the Middle Ages, narrow roads had reverted to being simultaneously used by pedestrians and wagons without any formal separation between the two categories. Early attempts at ensuring the adequate maintenance of foot-ways or sidewalks were often made, as in the Colchester Improvement Act 1623 (21 Jas. 1. c. \"34\") for Colchester, but they were generally not very effective.\nFollowing the Great Fire of London in 1666, attempts were slowly made to bring some order to the sprawling city. In 1671, \"Certain Orders, Rules and Directions Touching the Paving and Cleansing The Streets, Lanes and Common Passages within the City of London\" were formulated, calling for all streets to be adequately paved for pedestrians with cobblestones. Purbeck stone was widely used as a durable paving material. Bollards were also installed to protect pedestrians from the traffic in the middle of the road.\nThe British House of Commons passed a series of Paving Acts from the 18th century. The 1766 Paving &amp; Lighting Act authorized the City of London Corporation to establish foot-ways throughout all the streets of London, to pave them with Purbeck stone (the thoroughfare in the middle was generally cobblestone) and to raise them above the street level with kerbs forming the separation. The corporation was also made responsible for the regular upkeep of the roads, including their cleaning and repair, for which they charged a tax from 1766. Another turning point was the construction of Paris's Pont Neuf (1578\u20131606) which set several trends including wide, raised sidewalks separating pedestrians from the road traffic, plus the first Parisian bridge without houses built on it, and its generous width plus elegant, durable design that immediately became popular for promenading at the beginning of the century that saw Paris take its form renowned to this day. It was also a cultural phenomenon because all classes mixed on the new walkways. By the 19th-century large and spacious sidewalks were routinely constructed in European capitals, and were associated with urban sophistication.\nBenefits.\nTransportation.\nSidewalks played an important role in transportation, as they provided a path for people to walk along without stepping on horse manure. They aided road safety by minimizing interaction between pedestrians, horses, carriages, and later automobiles. Sidewalks are normally in pairs, one on each side of the road, with the center section of the road for motorized vehicles. Crosswalks provide pedestrians a space to cross between the two sides of the street at predictable locations.\nOn rural roads, sidewalks may not be present as the amount of traffic (pedestrian or motorized) may not be enough to justify separating the two. In suburban and urban areas, sidewalks are typically more common. In town and city centers (known as downtown in the USA) the amount of pedestrian traffic can exceed motorized traffic, and in this case the sidewalks can occupy more than half of the width of the road, or the whole road can be pedestrianized.\nEnvironment.\nSidewalks may have a small effect on reducing vehicle miles traveled and carbon dioxide emissions. A study of sidewalk and transit investments in Seattle neighborhoods found vehicle travel reductions of 6 to 8% and CO2 emission reductions of 1.3 to 2.2%\nRoad traffic safety.\nResearch commissioned for the Florida Department of Transportation, published in 2005, found that, in Florida, the Crash Reduction Factor (used to estimate the expected reduction of crashes during a given period) resulting from the installation of sidewalks averaged 74%.\nResearch at the University of North Carolina for the U.S. Department of Transportation found that the presence or absence of a sidewalk and the speed limit are significant factors in the likelihood of a vehicle/pedestrian crash. Sidewalk presence had a risk ratio of 0.118, which means that the likelihood of a crash on a road with a paved sidewalk was 88.2 percent lower than one without a sidewalk. The authors wrote that \"this should not be interpreted to mean that installing sidewalks would necessarily reduce the likelihood of pedestrian/motor vehicle crashes by 88.2 percent in all situations. However, the presence of a sidewalk clearly has a strong beneficial effect of reducing the risk of a 'walking along roadway' pedestrian/motor vehicle crash.\" The study does not count crashes that happen when walking across a roadway. The speed limit risk ratio was 1.116, which means that a 16.1-km/h (10-mi/h) increase in the limit yields a factor of (1.116)10 or 3.\nThe presence or absence of sidewalks was one of three factors that were found to encourage drivers to choose lower, safer speeds.\nOn the other hand, the implementation of schemes which involve the removal of sidewalks, such as shared space schemes, are reported to deliver a dramatic drop in crashes and congestion too, which indicates that a number of other factors, such as the local speed environment, also play an important role in whether sidewalks are necessarily the best local solution for pedestrian safety.\nIn cold weather, black ice is a common problem with unsalted sidewalks. The ice forms a thin transparent surface film which is almost impossible to see, and so results in many slips by pedestrians.\nRiding bicycles on sidewalks is discouraged since some research shows it to be more dangerous than riding in the street. Some jurisdictions prohibit sidewalk riding except for children. In addition to the risk of cyclist/pedestrian collisions, cyclists face increase risks from collisions with motor vehicles at street crossings and driveways. Riding in the direction opposite to traffic in the adjacent lane is especially risky.\nHealth.\nSince residents of neighborhoods with sidewalks are more likely to walk, they tend to have lower rates of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other health issues related to sedentary lifestyles. Also, children who walk to school have been shown to have better concentration.\nSocial uses.\nSome sidewalks may be used as social spaces with sidewalk caf\u00e9s, markets, or busking musicians, as well as for parking for a variety of vehicles including cars, motorbikes and bicycles. Sidewalk surfing was often used in the early 1960s to describe skateboarding.)\nConstruction.\nContemporary sidewalks are most often made of concrete in North America, while tarmac, asphalt, brick, stone, slab and (increasingly) rubber are more common in Europe. Different materials are more or less friendly environmentally: pumice-based trass, for example, when used as an extender is less energy-intensive than Portland cement concrete or petroleum-based materials such as asphalt or tar-penetration macadam. Multi-use paths alongside roads are sometimes made of materials that are softer than concrete, such as asphalt.\nSome sidewalks may be built like a Meandering Sidewalk. The meandering sidewalk is the wavy sidewalk that veers back and forth at the side of the road, no matter how straight the street. These sidewalks are common in North America and are used to break up the monotonous alignments of city blocks.\nWood.\nIn the 19th century and early 20th century, sidewalks of wood were common in some North American locations. They may still be found at historic beach locations and in conservation areas to protect the land beneath and around, called boardwalks.\nBrick.\nBrick sidewalks are found in some urban areas, usually for aesthetic purposes. Brick sidewalks are generally consolidated with brick hammers, rollers, and sometimes motorized vibrators.\nStone.\nStone slabs called \"flagstones\" or \"flags\" are sometimes used where an attractive appearance is required, as in historic town centers.\nFor example, in Melbourne, Australia, bluestone has been used to pave the sidewalks of the CBD since the Gold rush in the 1850s because it proved to be stronger, more plentiful and easier to work than most other available materials.\nStone and concrete pavers.\nPre-cast concrete pavers are used for sidewalks, often colored or textured to resemble stone. Sometimes cobblestones are used, though they are generally considered too uneven for comfortable walking.\nConcrete.\nIn the United States and Canada, the most common type of sidewalk consists of a poured concrete \"ribbon\", examples of which from as early as the 1860s can be found in good repair in San Francisco, and stamped with the name of the contractor and date of installation. When Portland cement was first imported to the United States in the 1880s, its principal use was in the construction of sidewalks.\nToday, most sidewalk ribbons are constructed with cross-lying strain-relief grooves placed or sawn at regular intervals, typically apart. This partitioning, an improvement over the continuous slab ribbon, was patented in 1924 by Arthur Wesley Hall and William Alexander McVay, who wished to minimize damage to the concrete from the effects of tectonic and temperature fluctuations, both of which can crack longer segments. The technique is not perfect, as freeze-thaw cycles (in cold-winter regions) and tree root growth can eventually result in damage which requires repair.\nIn highly variable climates which undergo multiple freeze-thaw cycles, concrete blocks will be formed with separations, called expansion joints, to allow for thermal expansion without breakage. The use of expansion joints in sidewalks may not be necessary, as the concrete will shrink while setting.\nTarmac and asphalt.\nIn the United Kingdom, Australia and France suburban sidewalks are also constructed of tarmac. In urban or inner-city areas sidewalks are most commonly constructed of slabs, stone, or brick depending upon the surrounding street architecture and furniture.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the context of law enforcement in the United States, such names are often used to refer to a corpse whose identity is unknown or cannot be confirmed. These names are also often used to refer to a hypothetical \"everyman\" in other contexts, like John Q. Public or \"Joe Public\". There are many variants to the above names, including John (or Richard)/Jane Roe, John/Jane Smith, Joe/Jane Bloggs, and Johnie/Janie Doe or just Baby Doe for children. The gender-neutral A. N. Other is also a placeholder name, mainly used in the United Kingdom. \nIn criminal investigation.\nIn other English-speaking countries, unique placeholder names, numbers or codenames have become more often used in the context of police investigations. This has included the United Kingdom, where usage of \"John Doe\" originated during the Middle Ages. However, the legal term \"John Doe injunction\" or \"John Doe order\" has survived in English law and other legal systems influenced by it. Other names, such as \"Joe Bloggs\" or \"John Smith\", have sometimes been informally used as placeholders for an every-man in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand; however, such names are seldom used in legal and/or police circles in the same sense as John Doe.\nWell-known legal cases named after placeholders include:\nIn the investigative context, John Doe and Jane Doe are also used as designations for unidentified dead bodies.\nHistory.\nUnder the legal terminology of Ancient Rome, the names \"\"Numerius Negidius\" and \"Aulus Agerius\"\" were used in relation to hypothetical defendants and plaintiffs. The names \"John Doe\" (or \"John Doo\") and \"Richard Roe\" (along with \"John Roe\") were regularly invoked in English legal instruments to satisfy technical requirements governing standing and jurisdiction, beginning perhaps as early as the reign of England's King Edward III (1327\u20131377). Though the rationale behind the choices of Doe and Roe is unknown, there are many suggested folk etymologies. Other fictitious names for a person involved in litigation in medieval English law were \"John Noakes\" (or \"Nokes\") and \"John-a-Stiles\" (or \"John Stiles\"). The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" states that John Doe is \"the name given to the fictitious lessee of the plaintiff, in the (now obsolete in the UK) mixed action of ejectment, the fictitious defendant being called Richard Roe\".\nThis usage is mocked in the 1834 English song \"John Doe and Richard Roe\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis particular use became obsolete in the UK in 1852:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As is well known, the device of involving real people as notional lessees and ejectors was used to enable freeholders to sue the real ejectors. These were then replaced by the fictional characters John Doe and Richard Roe. Eventually the medieval remedies were (mostly) abolished by the Real Property Limitation Act of 1833; the fictional characters of John Doe and Richard Roe by the Common Law Procedure Act 1852; and the forms of action themselves by the Judicature Acts 1873\u201375.\" \"Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs v Meier and others (2009).\"\nIn the UK, usage of \"John Doe\" survives mainly in the form of John Doe injunction or John Doe order (see above).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;8.02 If an unknown person has possession of the confidential personal information and is threatening to disclose it, a 'John Doe' injunction may be sought against that person. The first time this form of injunction was used since 1852 in the United Kingdom was in 2005 when lawyers acting for JK Rowling and her publishers obtained an interim order against an unidentified person who had offered to sell chapters of a stolen copy of an unpublished Harry Potter novel to the media.\nUnlike the United States, the name \"John Doe\" does not actually appear in the formal name of the case, for example: \"X &amp; Y v Persons Unknown\" [2007] HRLR 4. Well-known cases of unidentified decedents include \"Caledonia Jane Doe\" (1979), \"Princess Doe\" (1982) and \"Walker County Jane Doe\" (1980), all of whom have been identified. In 1997, New York City police discovered a decapitated body and were not able to find the killer. The body was named Peaches and also Jane Doe 3. The baby victim in a 2001 murder case in Kansas City, Missouri, was referred to as Precious Doe.\nIn 2009, the \"New York Times\" reported the difficulties and unwanted attention experienced by a man actually named John Doe, who had often been suspected of using a pseudonym. He had been questioned repeatedly by airport security staff. Another man named John Doe was often suspected of being an incognito celebrity.\nOther variants.\nIn cases where a large number of unidentified individuals are mentioned, numbers may be appended, such as \"Doe #2\" or \"Doe II\". Operation Delego (2009), which targeted an international child sexual abuse ring, cited 21 numbered \"John Does\", as well as other people known by the surnames \"Doe\", \"Roe\", \"Hoe\" and \"Poe\". \"John Stiles\", \"Richard Miles\" have been used for the third and fourth participants in an action. \"Mary Major\" has been used in some federal cases in the US. \"James Doe\" and \"Judy Doe\" are among other common variants.\nLess often, other surnames ending in \"-oe\" have been used when more than two unknown or unidentified persons are named in U.S. court proceedings, \"e.g.\",\nIn Massachusetts, \"Mary Moe\" is used to refer to pregnant women under the age of 18 petitioning the Superior Court for a judicial bypass exception to the parental consent requirement for abortion. \"Mary Moe\" is also used to refer to such cases generally, i.e. \"Mary Moe cases\". Sometimes \"Mary Doe\" may be used for the individuals.

Albertsons ranked 53rd in the 2018 \"Fortune\" 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Prior to its January 2015 merger with Safeway Inc. for $9.2 billion, it had 1,075 supermarkets located in 29 U.S. states under 12 different regional banners. Its predecessor company, Albertsons, Inc., was reorganized as Albertsons LLC and sold to AB Acquisition LLC, a Cerberus Capital Management\u2013led consortium. After buying back the majority of its former stores it sold to SuperValu in 2006, AB Acquisition announced it would change its name to Albertsons Companies Inc. in 2015. The company's corporate name was Albertson's Inc. until 2002, when the apostrophe was removed.\nOn October 14, 2022, Albertsons announced it would be acquired by rival Kroger for $25 billion. On November 30, 2023, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen announced that the companies had satisfied the informational requirements of the Federal Trade Commission, and the deal was expected to close in early 2024. However, in January 2024, Washington state sued to block the proposed $25 billion merger between Kroger and Albertsons, warning that if approved it could raise prices and harm consumers. In February 2024, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser also filed a lawsuit, saying consumers told him they feared it \"would lead to stores closing, higher prices, fewer jobs, worse customer service, and less resilient supply chains.\" Kroger and Albertsons terminated their merger attempt on December 11, 2024, after it was blocked by a federal and a state judge.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nAlbertsons was founded in 1939 by Joe Albertson (1906\u20131993) on July 21 in Boise, Idaho. An ad in Boise's \"Idaho Statesman\" newspaper touted Albertson's first store as \"Idaho's largest and finest food store.\" The store was filled with perks that, at the time, were brand new: free parking, a money-back guarantee, and even an ice cream shop. The original store was built onto several times, but it was demolished in 1979, and a replacement store was built on the same property. A brick monument stands on the northwest corner of 16th and State Streets in downtown Boise, commemorating the original store.\nThe grocery store was an enormous success, and Albertson reinvested his profits back into the business. New stores were opened in neighboring towns to the west: Nampa, Caldwell, and Emmett, before America's entry into World War II in late 1941. The company grew steadily in the years following World War II. When Albertson was considering putting a new store in a town, he would drive around the town and look for neighborhoods with children's clothing hanging on clotheslines, and station wagons in driveways; he knew that those kinds of neighborhoods were where he wanted to build his stores.\nAlbertson's, Inc. became a public company in 1959, and its growth continued, opening its hundredth store in Seattle in 1963. in 1964, Albertsons expanded to southern California by acquiring All American Markets, a small chain based in Orange County.\nIn 1967, Albertsons expanded into Colorado, acquiring eight stores from Furr's Supermarkets. By the end of the 1960s, Albertsons operated over 200 stores within a nine-state region and the stores averaged about 20,000 square feet in size.\nPartnership with Skaggs and 1970s expansion.\nIn 1969, Albertsons partnered with Skaggs Drug Centers, owned by the Skaggs Companies, Inc., to create the first combination food/drug stores, first in Texas. The partnership was a tremendous success for several years. The partnership ended due to the fact that it was getting more difficult to control. Neither partner could buy the other out, and the partnership was dissolved amicably in 1977. Skaggs kept stores in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, and Albertsons kept stores in Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana, as well as some Texas stores (based in San Antonio).\nAlbertsons continued to expand its base in the West during this time. In 1973, Albertsons opened its first distribution center in Brea, California. In 1974, Albertsons bought the four-store Monte Mart chain in northern California.\nAlbertsons bought Fazio's Shopping Bag in 1978 from Fisher Foods, adding 46 stores in Southern California.\nExpansion in the 1980s.\nIn 1981, Albertsons entered Nebraska and South Dakota.\nIn 1982, Albertsons reorganized its management into four regions: California, Northwest, Intermountain, and South. Albertsons continued to add stores in the 1980s, building or acquiring about 283 stores during the decade. Albertsons continued to expand in Texas beyond the Skaggs base in north Texas and San Antonio, re-entering the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth market in 1984, and adding three Skaggs-Alpha Beta stores in Austin within months after entering that market in early 1989 with the acquisition of six Tom Thumb stores.\nAlbertsons built its first fully mechanized distribution center in Portland, Oregon, in 1988.\nIn 1989, Albertsons opened its 500th store, in Temecula, California.\nExpansion in the 1990s.\nAlbertsons began to expand heavily in the 1990s. In 1992, Albertsons bought the stores American Stores (formerly Skaggs Drugs Cos.) had in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Florida. Many of the stores had been opened as Skaggs Albertsons originally (later turning into \"Skaggs Alpha Beta\" under American Stores ownership) but by 1991 had been rebranded as Jewel-Osco. These included a few stores that American Stores opened in the late 1980s under that name in Florida. Additionally, a non-food distribution center in Ponca City, Oklahoma, was purchased from ASC.\nIn 1994, Albertsons would acquire four stores from San Diego County chain Big Bear Markets.\nThe Skaggs acquisition was a success, and the new stores were integrated into Albertsons's Southern division. The ease of that acquisition and Albertsons's high-flying stock price led Albertsons to attempt expansion on a grand scale. In a series of acquisitions in the late 1990s, Albertsons purchased Seessel's and 14 other stores from Bruno's, Buttrey Food &amp; Drug (divesting seven Buttrey stores and six Albertsons stores to Smith's and another two Buttrey stores to SuperValu), the Springfield, Missouri Smitty's chain, and three Super One Foods stores from Miner's Inc. in the Des Moines market, all while building new stores across all divisions. These acquisitions brought Albertsons into five new states: Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, and Tennessee.\nAlbertsons Express gas stations.\nAlbertsons launched a new branch of their brand in 1997, Albertsons Express, which included a fuel center and a convenience store. The first of the Albertsons Express opened that year in Eagle, Idaho. This branch was constructed in front of the parking lot of Albertson's full-size grocery store at the city's Parkcenter Boulevard. This concept was not limited to Idaho; it expanded to locations across America located on Albertsons\u2019 existing/new stores properties. A few of the locations with Express Gas Stations include Gresham, Hillsboro, and Portland in Oregon; Houston in Texas; and Casper and Cheyenne in Wyoming.\nAmerican Stores acquisition.\nIn 1998, Albertsons made its biggest acquisition yet: American Stores Company, which included the chains ACME in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware; Lucky in California and Nevada; Jewel and Jewel-Osco in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa, and two drug store chains: Osco Drug, with a presence in New England, the Midwest, Montana and Arizona; and Sav-on Drugs, with a presence in Southern California, Nevada, Western Arizona, and New Mexico. The acquisition briefly made Albertsons the largest American food and drug operator, with over 2,500 stores (including stand-alone drug stores) in 37 states, until Kroger's acquisition of Fred Meyer closed the following month. To make the acquisition, Albertsons was forced by anti-trust concerns to divest 146 stores in California, Nevada, and New Mexico, to Certified Grocers, Raley's, Ralphs, Stater Bros., and Vons. In California, Nevada, and New Mexico, there were already Albertsons stores, so in order to not have two banners in the same area, 508 Lucky stores were converted to the Albertsons banner in November 1999, and the Lucky brand name was retired. The brand was reintroduced in the mid 2000s.\nIn January 2001, Albertsons restructured its \"districts\" to a divisional structure mostly based around distribution centers, with a drug store division and 18 regional division offices.\n2001\u20132004 restructuring.\nOn July 18, 2001, Larry Johnston, the new chairman and CEO of Albertson's, announced it would close 165 \"underperforming\" stores spread across 25 states, cut jobs, and reduce its newly created operating divisions. The first change was that the Utah, Idaho, and Big Sky (Montana) division were merged back into Intermountain, while Oregon, Washington, and the Inland Empire (eastern Washington and Northern Idaho) division would be consolidated back into a single Northwestern division. Albertsons sold its freestanding Osco Drug stores in the northeastern states to Jean Coutu Group, a Canadian drug store company (those stores were re-branded as Brooks Pharmacy after the sale was completed in January 2002). In 2001, the short-lived Des Moines stores would close as well and Albertsons began to issue Albertsons Preferred Savings Cards for all of its stores.\nThe following year, three more divisions were closed entirely:\nAdditionally, the distribution center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, (home of the Great Plains division) was sold to Fleming Companies, though no stores were closed. The Great Plains division stretched all the way into Omaha, Nebraska. The sale of the distribution center included a distribution deal for Fleming to continue to supply Oklahoma and Omaha.\nAfter stabilizing the company's finances and consolidating divisions in 2004, Albertsons acquired Shaw's Supermarkets and Star Market from Sainsbury's for $2.5 billion. Albertsons also purchased Bristol Farms for $135 million. During the same time, Albertsons exited the markets of Omaha, where it closed or sold 21 stores, and New Orleans, Louisiana, where it closed seven, selling four to A&amp;P, which converted them to Sav-A-Center.\nSale to Cerberus and SuperValu.\nDespite this, the acquisition spree had caused significant problems for Albertsons, Inc. Many of the acquired chains had systems that did not mesh well with Albertsons. Financing those acquisitions required Albertsons Inc. to take on significant debt. Added to those problems were significant changes in consumer buying patterns, including new competition from large discounters such as Walmart and Costco that impacted sales.\nAfter several assessments of the company and months of rumors, it was announced on January 23, 2006, Albertsons, Inc. was to be sold to a consortium of companies. SuperValu would take the bulk of the company including the brand names and what was considered to be the stronger divisions, including 3 Albertsons divisions: the Southern California division (Southern California; Southern Nevada; along with stores in Hanford and Tulare, in Northern California), the Northwest division (Oregon except Ontario, Washington State, and the Idaho Panhandle), and the Intermountain division (Southern Idaho; Elko, Nevada; Utah; Jackson and Rock Springs, Wyoming; Montana; Ontario, Oregon; and North Dakota) as well as the ACME, Bristol Farms, Jewel-Osco, and Shaw's Supermarkets and Star Market brands. This acquisition would also lead to SuperValu gaining access to over 100 Albertsons Express fuel centers.\nCVS would acquire 702 stand-alone Osco and Sav-on Drug stores and converted them to CVS Pharmacy stores. They also closed about 100 of the 702.\nWhat was left of Albertsons Inc. became Albertsons, LLC, purchased by a Cerberus-led group of investors, and CVS Pharmacy. The acquisition was completed on June 2, 2006, with the Cerberus-led group (who also included Kimco Realty Corporation, Schottenstein Stores Corp., Lubert-Adler Partners, and Klaff Realty). They held Albertsons LLC as \"AB Acquisition LLC\". Albertsons LLC included 661 stores and the distribution centers and offices from five of Albertsons divisions. These five divisions were thought to be Albertsons' five weakest divisions, and conventional wisdom in the industry was that the stores would eventually be closed or sold to other operators.\nAs of June 2, 2006, the company's retail stores were divided as follows:\nFollowing the sale, Albertson's, Inc., was removed from the NYSE. Albertsons LLC was technically the successor company to Albertsons according to SEC filings but it was New Albertsons Inc. that assumed most of the debt, got most of the property, and transitioned Albertsons stock into SuperValu stock.\nThe five Albertsons Inc. divisions that remained as Albertsons LLC were the Dallas/Fort Worth division (Texas excluding El Paso, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas), the Rocky Mountain division (Colorado, Wyoming excluding Rock Springs and Jackson stores, Nebraska, and South Dakota), the Southwest division (Arizona, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas), the Florida division (Florida), and the Northern California division (northern California excluding Hanford and Tulare stores, and northern Nevada). Albertsons LLC then concentrated on rebuilding market share and its store base in its stronger areas and divesting stores and other property in its weaker areas.\nOn June 6, 2006, only one week after Albertsons LLC was created, the company announced its intent to close 100 Albertsons stores by August 2006, including all but two Super Saver stores. Those closures were spread across all five divisions. Soon after, the company announced that it would be shutting down its online delivery service on July 21, 2006. To distinguish the two companies, Albertsons LLC created a second website, \"AlbertsonsMarket.com\".\nA leaner company.\nIn November 2006, it was announced that the Northern California division, consisting of stores located in northern California and northern Nevada, would be sold to Save Mart, with the deal closing in late February 2007. The company gradually converted all the stores to its Save Mart banner over summer 2007, except for stores in the San Francisco Bay area, which were rebranded as Lucky. The deal included two Northern California distribution centers. Most of the Albertsons locations had originally been branded as Lucky before Albertson's 1998 purchase of American Stores.\nMost of the changes in the next six years would downscale the remaining divisions. In the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth division, in 2007, the distribution center was sold and outsourced to Associated Wholesale Grocers, and Albertsons would exit both Oklahoma and Austin. The Oklahoma stores were sold to \nAssociated Wholesale Grocers members while the Austin stores were sold to H-E-B. With the closures, only four stores south of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth area existed in Texas, all of which were closed or sold by December 2011. Additionally, many of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex stores closed during this time, even into 2011.\nThe Florida division, which was always discontiguous with Albertsons' main market, suffered a blow in June 2008 when Albertsons LLC entered into an agreement with Lakeland, Florida-based Publix stores to sell 49 Florida Albertsons locations to the chain. This included 15 stores in Northern and Northwest Florida, 30 locations in Central Florida, and four locations in South Florida. The sale was completed in September. In April 2012, the company closed most of its stores in Florida. The Plant City distribution center was sold to Gordon Food Service though the Florida Division continued to be located there. By April 2012, only four stores remained in the entire state of Florida.\nThe Rocky Mountain division slowly shed stores. By April 2007, there were only 32 stores left in the state of Colorado. In December 2007, SuperValu acquired the eight remaining Wyoming locations from Albertson's LLC not already owned by the company. These stores continued to operate under the Albertsons banner. 2008 also brought the sale of Albertsons' lone South Dakota and Nebraska stores to Nash Finch. In August 2009, the distribution center and division office closed and the 26 remaining stores moved to the Southwest division.\nOnly the Southwest division was spared the major cuts suffered by the other divisions. On June 12, 2007, Albertsons LLC agreed to acquire all Raley's locations in New Mexico. The acquisition includes one closed and eight operating stores in Albuquerque and one store in Taos, thus doubling Albertsons store base in the Albuquerque metro.\nIn June 2007, Albertson's LLC decided to discontinue its Preferred Savings Card Program, choosing instead to offer discounted items to all of its customers. In September 2007, all Albertsons stores in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and Florida markets began collecting their Albertsons Preferred Savings Cards.\nEnd of the first generation of Albertsons Express.\nBeginning in 2008, Albertsons began exiting the fuel business, selling 72 of over one hundred Albertsons Express gas stations to Valero Energy, which converted most of them to Corner Store locations. This would not be the end though, as many Express stores still remained including Cheyenne, WY. It would not be until 2011\u20132013 that most of the Albertsons Express locations were divested under the Supervalu company. Even then, some locations including Hillsboro still displayed Albertsons Express banners.\nNew Albertsons acquisition.\nWhile Albertsons LLC had restored its stores to profitability, SuperValu's New Albertsons Inc. had done poorly. While SuperValu did remodel many stores and open a few new stores, New Albertsons had shrunk. Of the 1100+ stores SuperValu acquired in 2006, fewer than 900 remained by 2013. Under SuperValu, Bristol Farms had been sold off, 36 Utah stores were sold to Associated Food Stores (leaving just three traditional Albertsons stores in the state), the Wisconsin Jewel-Osco stores had been sold or closed, as well as the Shaw's stores in Connecticut. Additionally, like Albertsons LLC, most of the fuel stations had been shuttered or sold to other operators.\nOn January 10, 2013, it was announced that SuperValu was selling New Albertsons (Albertsons, ACME, Shaw's/Star Market, and Jewel-Osco, though they had previously sold off Bristol Farms in 2010) to Cerberus Capital Management. The deal was closed in March 2013. On February 23, 2013, AB Acquisition announced it would split operations of the newly combined company into eight divisions: Northwestern, Intermountain, Southern California, Southern, Jewel-Osco, ACME, Shaw's, and Southwestern, and in March 2013, the deal was officially closed. On paper, Albertsons LLC controlled the Albertsons-branded stores and New Albertsons Inc. controlled ACME, Shaw's/Star Market, and Jewel-Osco, but it was operated as one company.\nOn June 11, 2013, Albertsons announced its plans to merge its duplicate websites, social media accounts and mobile apps onto one of each kind, ending the use of the Albertsons Market branding (though this was never used on store exteriors) and AlbertsonsMarket.com. While its website consolidation appeared to take place as expected, its applications received bad reviews\u2014but the biggest consequence was the mistaken deletion of their previous Facebook page and loss of over 200,000 fans. While no details were given as to the mistake made, Albertsons simply admitted that while attempting to join their Albertsons page with over 200,000 Likes and their Albertsons Market page with over 80,000 Likes, something went wrong resulting in the loss of thousands of Likes and comments.\nThat same month, Albertsons did away with the Preferred Savings Card in the former SuperValu stores that Albertsons LLC had dispensed with in 2007. The cards briefly continued in Southern California stores before being discontinued in July 2013.\nUnited Supermarkets acquisition.\nOn September 9, 2013, the company acquired Lubbock-based supermarket United Supermarkets LLC. On February 4, 2014, the FTC voted 4\u20130 to approve the deal. The acquisition deal cost Albertsons $385 million and required Albertsons to sell its single stores in the Amarillo, Texas, and Wichita Falls, Texas, markets. The United Supermarkets family brands include Market Street, Amigos, and United Express.\nAfter the deal was finalized, the Albertsons Market brand was revived for Albertsons stores operated by United. The first to be branded as such opened in Alamogordo, New Mexico, in January 2015.\nSafeway acquisition.\nOn February 19, 2014, Safeway began to explore selling itself, and by February 21, 2014, it was in advanced negotiations with Cerberus Capital Management. On March 6, 2014, Cerberus (parent company of Albertsons) announced it would purchase Safeway for $9.4 billion in a deal expected to close in the 4th quarter of the year.\nOn July 25, 2014, Safeway stockholders approved the merger with Albertsons.\nIn December 2014, Albertsons announced that the Haggen Company, a Bellingham, Washington, based grocery chain, was buying 146 Safeway, Albertsons and Vons stores, as required by the antitrust review of the merger.\nOn January 30, 2015, Albertsons officially acquired Safeway Inc. after being cleared by the FTC, thus giving it control of the Safeway store banners, including Randalls, Tom Thumb, Carrs Safeway, Vons, and Pavilions, plus Safeway's 49% share of Casa Ley, a Mexican grocery chain. Following the merger, Albertsons announced the new company would have 14 divisions led by three regional offices.\nAnnouncement and postponement of going public and A&amp;P acquisition.\nAfter several months of rumors, the combined operation announced it would go public as Albertsons Companies, Inc. (the new name of AB Acquisition LLC). Albertsons attempted to IPO with the ticker ABS on October 14, 2015, planning to raise as much as $1.7 billion, selling 65.3 million shares with a range of $23 - $26 per share. However, the company postponed the listing due to market conditions, particularly after Wal-Mart warned of more challenged sales earlier that day. Albertsons has reportedly postponed the IPO indefinitely, as of October 2015. All during this time, Albertsons continued to expand, purchasing 70 stores owned by the bankrupt Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (operating under the names of The Food Emporium, A&amp;P, A&amp;P Fresh, Superfresh, and Pathmark), which were quickly reopened as ACME stores after two-day store resets.\nPost-Safeway: Acquisitions, conversions, expansions, and selloffs.\nAs a result of the Albertsons-Safeway merger, Albertsons began to look to divest some stores in geographies where the merger could cause a high market share. Some of these stores including one Albertsons and three Safeway stores in Wyoming were sold off to Ridley's Family Markets.\nAlso at the time of the Albertsons-Safeway merger, the 18-store Pacific Northwest chain Haggen purchased 146 West Coast Vons, Pavilions, Albertsons, and Safeway locations that had to be sold due to anti-trust concerns, paying $300 million, plus spending $100 million to rebrand the stores. The FTC had hoped this would create a regional competitor for Albertsons. On September 1, 2015, Haggen announced that the company had filed a lawsuit against Albertsons LLC and Albertsons Holdings LLC (\"Albertsons\") seeking more than $1 billion in damages. The complaint, which was filed that day in United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleged that following Haggen's December 2014 purchase of 146 Albertsons and Safeway stores, Albertsons engaged in \"coordinated and systematic efforts to eliminate competition and Haggen as a viable competitor in over 130 local grocery markets in five states\", and \"made false representations to both Haggen and the FTC about Albertsons's commitment to a seamless transformation of the stores into viable competitors under the Haggen banner\".\nA week later Haggen filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and began the process of closing all but a few dozen 'core' stores in the Pacific Northwest. Albertsons would buy back 33 of the stores being sold at auction. In January 2016, Albertsons settled the lawsuit, agreeing to pay $5.75 million to Haggen, and subsequently reached an agreement to acquire the remaining 29 'core' Haggen stores located in Washington and Oregon for $106 million, the deal being approved on March 29, 2016. As part of the deal, 15 stores would still operate under the Haggen banner, with the rest converted to Albertsons locations.\nDuring this time, the Albertsons family experienced further changes. On January 11, 2016, it was announced that the three remaining Albertsons stores in Florida, located in Largo, Altamonte Springs and Oakland Park, would be re-bannered as Safeway; this marked the first time that the Safeway brand would exist on a supermarket operation in Florida. It would also re-align the stores toward the Eastern Division. In 2016, smaller acquisitions included Homedale, Idaho-based Paul's Market and Santa Rosa, California-based G&amp;G Supermarkets. Both brands were closed before they were converted into Albertsons and Safeway stores, respectively. Additionally, the United Supermarkets subsidiary acquired seven locations from Sweetwater, Texas-based Lawrence Brothers. These were converted into United Supermarkets or Albertsons Market stores. In late 2016, it was announced that Andronico's in the San Francisco area would be acquired as well. These stores would become \"Safeway Community Markets\" and still hold what made Andronico's unique, including chef-prepared items. When the first store reopened in February 2017 under the ownership of the Northern California division, it was still bannered as Andronico's due to an issue in obtaining local permits but the other stores were able to reopen as Safeway Community Markets.\nOn February 17, 2017, the Randalls store in south Katy, Texas, serving the Cinco Ranch area closed. On March 6, 2017, shortly after the Katy Randalls closure, it was announced that the Houston-area distribution center near Cypress, Texas, would be closed and the operations consolidated in the Roanoke, Texas, Tom Thumb distribution center in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex to supply the Houston- and Austin-area stores instead. Also, the Houston Division offices would be folded into the legacy Albertsons's South Division offices in Fort Worth. Additionally, the stores in the Albuquerque market were realigned toward the United Supermarkets division.\nOn September 20, 2017, Albertsons acquired meal kit company Plated for $200 million.\nDuring the time after the Albertsons-Safeway merger, Albertsons was experimenting with different banners, converting many stores to Safeway, including many Colorado Albertsons locations. With this rebranding also came additional closures, such as Centennial, Colorado. Some exceptions include Pueblo and Durango in Colorado, which are owned by a different division.\nAlbertsons Express expansion.\nTo start off 2018, Albertsons began to reenter the fuel market, opening a brand new Albertsons Express in Boise, ID at the site of a former Pizza Hut; this also introduced a new concept to the state of Idaho's gas stations, where the pumps are chip-credit-card enabled. At least one Albertsons Express from the original generation of Albertson's fuel centers located in Hillsboro, Oregon, remained open in the relaunch of Albertsons Express. As of September 2021, there are exactly seven Albertsons Express across America. They are located in Idaho with three sites; and in Louisiana, Nevada, Oregon, and Texas with one site each.\nAdditional acquisitions and closures.\nOn February 20, 2018, Albertsons announced plans to acquire Rite Aid, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. In addition to retaining the stand-alone Rite Aid pharmacies, its Osco and Sav-on pharmacies located in Albertsons's existing stores were expected to be replaced by Rite Aid pharmacies. On August 8, 2018, Rite Aid announced that the plan had failed to please shareholders and the proposed acquisition would be canceled.\nThat same year, Albertsons closed several stores across multiple divisions, including all three Safeway stores in Florida. These stores were sold to Publix for an undisclosed price. With the closing, Albertsons officially exited the state, which it had been in since the late 1970s when they acquired their Skaggs Albertsons stores. Additionally, the company divested its share in Casa Ley, selling it to Tenedora CL del Noroeste.\nAlso that year three new Lucky locations in Utah opened, two in West Valley City and Salt Lake City, replacing the last two Super Saver stores, and one in Tooele, replacing a former Albertsons store.\nThe next year, a location in West Jordan, Utah, opened, replacing another Albertsons that closed in the late 2000s.\nIn 2019, Albertsons opened Albertsons Market Street in Meridian, Idaho, a flagship store located in a converted ShopKo store and based on the Market Street brand of United Supermarkets. This became Albertsons's largest store at 110,000 square feet and featured a variety of departments exclusive to the store or found rarely in the chain, including an oyster bar, a full bar area, and in-house sausages. Additionally, around the same time, a new Andronico's Community Markets opened in Monterey, California, the first new store to be branded as such.\nIn 2020, Albertsons announced the closing of a distribution center in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, laying off up 520 people. Albertsons said its duties will be shifted to an existing distribution center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which will add up to 300 workers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Albertsons's total sales experienced a growth of 27% compared to the previous year. The rise in sales and higher traffic came as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in gross sales of $22.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, the company finally went public in June 2020 after years of delays.\n The potential IPO for the company could be valued at around $19 billion. During the time of going public, one more division change was announced when the Mid-Atlantic Division was created by combining Eastern and ACME Markets, and based out of ACME's headquarters in Malvern, PA In October 2020, Albertsons submitted a winning bid for the Kings Food Markets/Balducci's chain. These will be merged into the Mid-Atlantic Division.\nFailed acquisition by Kroger.\nOn October 14, 2022, Kroger announced its intent to merge with Albertsons, with Kroger acquiring all Albertsons shares and divesting some stores to secure regulatory approval. The $24.6 billion transaction was expected to close in early 2024. The announcement was met with criticism due to the potential for monopolies to form in some U.S. cities that have few other grocery chains, as well as food deserts that would form from store closures.\nOn November 1, 2022, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit in King County Superior Court against Albertsons and Kroger seeking to halt the payment of a $4\u00a0billion dividend to Albertsons shareholders. The lawsuit aims to prevent Albertsons from winding down operations and preparing store closures during regulator review of the merger. Other state attorneys general have also investigated the merger according to Reuters. In February 2024, the FTC sued to block the acquisition stating that the deal would negatively impact consumer prices and workers' wages.\nIn February 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and attorney generals in eight states filed an anti-trust lawsuit to stop the merger. The case went to trial in August 2024. \nIn October 2024, Albertsons settled a lawsuit filed by prosecutors in five California counties. The allegations include price overcharging and false weight advertising.\nIn December 2024, \"a federal court issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday against the proposed merger of grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons, siding with the Biden administration. \u2026 The $25 billion deal would have merged the country's second and fourth-largest grocers by market share, with Kroger trailing only Walmart and Albertsons sitting behind Costco.\"\nOn December 11, 2024, Albertsons Companies, Inc. announced the termination of its merger agreement with Kroger. This decision followed injunctions issued \nby the U.S. District Court in Oregon and the King County Superior Court for the State of Washington, which blocked the proposed $25 billion merger. In response to the failed merger, Albertsons filed a lawsuit against Kroger in the Delaware Court of Chancery, alleging willful breach of contract and seeking billions of dollars in damages. The termination entitled Albertsons to an immediate $600 million termination fee and removed contractual constraints on pursuing other strategic opportunities. Following these events, Albertsons announced plans to accelerate its \"Customers for Life\" strategy, increase its quarterly cash dividend by 25%, and authorize a $2 billion share repurchase program.\nChains.\nAlbertsons operates stores under the following banners:\nFormer banners/chains/names:\nBrands.\nAlbertsons once owned several store brands (\"private label\" brands), often bearing the name of the chain sold under, e.g. \"Jewel\" brand products in the Jewel and Jewel-Osco locations. Other Albertsons brands over the years have included \"A+\", \"Good Day\", \"Janet Lee\" (named after the executive vice-president's daughter), \"Master's Choice\", and \"Village Market\". The drug store brands (used for health and beauty aids, over-the-counter medications, and intimate paper goods) were consolidated under the name \"Equaline\", rather than the previous \"Sav-On Osco by Albertsons\" brand. Albertsons introduced an upscale private label brand, \"Essensia\", in 2003, which was later renamed by SuperValu as Culinary Circle.\nStore brand items in Albertsons stores included Albertsons (national brand quality food), Arctic Shores (frozen seafood), Baby Basics (diapers and infant care items), Culinary Circle (\"gourmet\" foods and ready-made meals), Equaline (health and beauty products), Farm Fresh (fresh produce), Flavorite (national brand quality foods, used throughout Supervalu stores), Homelife (national brand quality non-foods), Java Delight (coffee), Shoppers Value (value-priced items), Stockman &amp; Dakota (high-quality beef), Stone Ridge (ice cream and sherbet), Super Chill (soft drinks and mixers), Whole Care Pet (pet foods and supplies), and Wild Harvest (natural and organic foods). In 2011, SuperValu announced it would eliminate Flavorite and all brands named after the chains it operates (such as Albertsons, Jewel, and Shaw's) and would replace those labels with a new label, Essential Everyday.\nAfter its purchase of Safeway, Albertsons began replacing some of its brands with Safeway's. O Organics and Open Nature replaced Wild Harvest, Pantry Essentials replaced Shoppers Value, and Refreshe replaced Super Chill. By late 2015, the remaining store brands were replaced with \"Signature\" (formerly Safeway Care, Farms, Home, and Kitchens). Albertsons started selling Lucerne dairy products, Mom To Mom baby products, and Priority Pet Food as well.\nAlbertsons Companies line of Own Brands products launches 1,100 brand new items a year, making it one of the most diverse in-house brands in the country. Albertsons Companies' O Organics line is one of the nation's largest brand of USDA-certified organic products, with annual sales over $1 billion; it offers a wide array of products, for a variety of customers.\nSome of the brands in use are:\nOperations.\nOn average, stores in the Albertsons Companies range between and and almost universally feature a bakery, deli, meat counter, produce department, and seafood counter; many of the stores also feature in-store banks and pharmacies. Larger and newer stores may also offer enhanced amenities, including Starbucks coffee counters, prepared foods, in-store pizza, salad bars, and juice bars.\nSustainability and animal welfare.\nIn 2016, Albertsons announced that it would transition to sourcing only cage-free eggs by 2025.\nIn 2023, Albertsons announced that it would ensure that their Own Brands packaging is 100% recyclable by 2025, and reach zero food waste to landfill by 2030 .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
