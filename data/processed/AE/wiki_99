They do this by cleaving the peptide bonds within proteins by hydrolysis, a reaction where water breaks bonds. Proteases are involved in numerous biological pathways, including digestion of ingested proteins, protein catabolism (breakdown of old proteins), and cell signaling.\nIn the absence of functional accelerants, proteolysis would be very slow, taking hundreds of years. Proteases can be found in all forms of life and viruses. They have independently evolved multiple times, and different classes of protease can perform the same reaction by completely different catalytic mechanisms.\nClassification.\nBased on catalytic residue.\nProteases can be classified into seven broad groups:\nProteases were first grouped into 84 families according to their evolutionary relationship in 1993, and classified under four catalytic types: serine, cysteine, aspartic, and metallo proteases. The threonine and glutamic proteases were not described until 1995 and 2004 respectively. The mechanism used to cleave a peptide bond involves making an amino acid residue that has the cysteine and threonine (proteases) or a water molecule (aspartic, glutamic and metalloproteases) nucleophilic so that it can attack the peptide carbonyl group. One way to make a nucleophile is by a catalytic triad, where a histidine residue is used to activate serine, cysteine, or threonine as a nucleophile. This is not an evolutionary grouping, however, as the nucleophile types have evolved convergently in different superfamilies, and some superfamilies show divergent evolution to multiple different nucleophiles. Metalloproteases, aspartic, and glutamic proteases utilize their active site residues to activate a water molecule, which then attacks the scissile bond.\nPeptide lyases.\nA seventh catalytic type of proteolytic enzymes, asparagine peptide lyase, was described in 2011. Its proteolytic mechanism is unusual since, rather than hydrolysis, it performs an elimination reaction. During this reaction, the catalytic asparagine forms a cyclic chemical structure that cleaves itself at asparagine residues in proteins under the right conditions. Given its fundamentally different mechanism, its inclusion as a peptidase may be debatable.\nBased on evolutionary phylogeny.\nAn up-to-date classification of protease evolutionary superfamilies is found in the MEROPS database. In this database, proteases are classified firstly by 'clan' (superfamily) based on structure, mechanism and catalytic residue order (e.g. the PA clan where P indicates a mixture of nucleophile families). Within each 'clan', proteases are classified into families based on sequence similarity (e.g. the S1 and C3 families within the PA clan). Each family may contain many hundreds of related proteases (e.g. trypsin, elastase, thrombin and streptogrisin within the S1 family).\nCurrently more than 50 clans are known, each indicating an independent evolutionary origin of proteolysis.\nBased on optimal pH.\nAlternatively, proteases may be classified by the optimal pH in which they are active:\nEnzymatic function and mechanism.\nProteases are involved in digesting long protein chains into shorter fragments by splitting the peptide bonds that link amino acid residues. Some detach the terminal amino acids from the protein chain (exopeptidases, such as aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidase A); others attack internal peptide bonds of a protein (endopeptidases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, papain, elastase).\nCatalysis.\nCatalysis is achieved by one of two mechanisms:\nSpecificity.\nProteolysis can be highly promiscuous such that a wide range of protein substrates are hydrolyzed. This is the case for digestive enzymes such as trypsin, which have to be able to cleave the array of proteins ingested into smaller peptide fragments. Promiscuous proteases typically bind to a single amino acid on the substrate and so only have specificity for that residue. For example, trypsin is specific for the sequences ...K\\... or ...R\\... ('\\'=cleavage site).\nConversely some proteases are highly specific and only cleave substrates with a certain sequence. Blood clotting (such as thrombin) and viral polyprotein processing (such as TEV protease) requires this level of specificity in order to achieve precise cleavage events. This is achieved by proteases having a long binding cleft or tunnel with several pockets that bind to specified residues. For example, TEV protease is specific for the sequence ...ENLYFQ\\S... ('\\'=cleavage site).\nDegradation and autolysis.\nProteases, being themselves proteins, are cleaved by other protease molecules, sometimes of the same variety. This acts as a method of regulation of protease activity. Some proteases are less active after autolysis (e.g. TEV protease) whilst others are more active (e.g. trypsinogen).\nBiodiversity of proteases.\nProteases occur in all organisms, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes to viruses. These enzymes are involved in a multitude of physiological reactions from simple digestion of food proteins to highly regulated cascades (e.g., the blood-clotting\n cascade, the complement system, apoptosis pathways, and the invertebrate prophenoloxidase-activating cascade). Proteases can either break specific peptide bonds (\"limited proteolysis\"), depending on the amino acid sequence of a protein, or completely break down a peptide to amino acids (\"unlimited proteolysis\"). The activity can be a destructive change (abolishing a protein's function or digesting it to its principal components), it can be an activation of a function, or it can be a signal in a signalling pathway.\nPlants.\nPlant genomes encode hundreds of proteases, largely of unknown function. Those with known function are largely involved in developmental regulation. Plant proteases also play a role in regulation of photosynthesis.\nAnimals.\nProteases are used throughout an organism for various metabolic processes. Acid proteases secreted into the stomach (such as pepsin) and serine proteases present in the duodenum (trypsin and chymotrypsin) enable the digestion of protein in food. Proteases present in blood serum (thrombin, plasmin, Hageman factor, etc.) play an important role in blood-clotting, as well as lysis of the clots, and the correct action of the immune system. Other proteases are present in leukocytes (elastase, cathepsin G) and play several different roles in metabolic control. Some snake venoms are also proteases, such as pit viper haemotoxin and interfere with the victim's blood clotting cascade. Proteases determine the lifetime of other proteins playing important physiological roles like hormones, antibodies, or other enzymes. This is one of the fastest \"switching on\" and \"switching off\" regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of an organism.\nBy a complex cooperative action, proteases can catalyze cascade reactions, which result in rapid and efficient amplification of an organism's response to a physiological signal.\nBacteria.\nBacteria secrete proteases to hydrolyse the peptide bonds in proteins and therefore break the proteins down into their constituent amino acids. Bacterial and fungal proteases are particularly important to the global carbon and nitrogen cycles in the recycling of proteins, and such activity tends to be regulated by nutritional signals in these organisms. The net impact of nutritional regulation of protease activity among the thousands of species present in soil can be observed at the overall microbial community level as proteins are broken down in response to carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur limitation.\nBacteria contain proteases responsible for general protein quality control (e.g. the AAA+ proteasome) by degrading unfolded or misfolded proteins.\nA secreted bacterial protease may also act as an exotoxin, and be an example of a virulence factor in bacterial pathogenesis (for example, exfoliative toxin). Bacterial exotoxic proteases destroy extracellular structures.\nViruses.\nThe genomes of some viruses encode one massive polyprotein, which needs a protease to cleave this into functional units (e.g. the hepatitis C virus and the picornaviruses). These proteases (e.g. TEV protease) have high specificity and only cleave a very restricted set of substrate sequences. They are therefore a common target for protease inhibitors.\nArchaea.\nArchaea use proteases to regulate various cellular processes from cell-signaling, metabolism, secretion and protein quality control. Only two ATP-dependent proteases are found in archaea: the membrane associated LonB protease and a soluble 20S proteosome complex .\nTumours.\nProteases are associated with cancer progression due to their ability to degrade extracellular matrices, which facilitates invasion and metastasis; these enzymes target a diversity of substrates and favour all steps of tumour production; some proteases have tumour-suppressive effects, associated with more than 30 different enzymes that belong to three distinct protease classes.\nUses.\nThe field of protease research is enormous. Since 2004, approximately 8000 papers related to this field were published each year. Proteases are used in industry, medicine and as a basic biological research tool.\nDigestive proteases are part of many laundry detergents and are also used extensively in the bread industry in bread improver. A variety of proteases are used medically both for their native function (e.g. controlling blood clotting) or for completely artificial functions (\"e.g.\" for the targeted degradation of pathogenic proteins). Highly specific proteases such as TEV protease and thrombin are commonly used to cleave fusion proteins and affinity tags in a controlled fashion.\nProtease-containing plant-solutions called \"vegetarian rennet\" have been in use for hundreds of years in Europe and the Middle East for making kosher and halal cheeses. Vegetarian rennet from \"Withania coagulans\" has been in use for thousands of years as a Ayurvedic remedy for digestion and diabetes in the Indian subcontinent. It is also used to make Paneer.\nInhibitors.\nThe activity of proteases is inhibited by protease inhibitors. One example of protease inhibitors is the serpin superfamily. It includes alpha 1-antitrypsin (which protects the body from excessive effects of its own inflammatory proteases), alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (which does likewise), C1-inhibitor (which protects the body from excessive protease-triggered activation of its own complement system), antithrombin (which protects the body from excessive coagulation), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (which protects the body from inadequate coagulation by blocking protease-triggered fibrinolysis), and neuroserpin.\nNatural protease inhibitors include the family of lipocalin proteins, which play a role in cell regulation and differentiation. Lipophilic ligands, attached to lipocalin proteins, have been found to possess tumor protease inhibiting properties. The natural protease inhibitors are not to be confused with the protease inhibitors used in antiretroviral therapy. Some viruses, with HIV/AIDS among them, depend on proteases in their reproductive cycle. Thus, protease inhibitors are developed as antiviral therapeutic agents.\nOther natural protease inhibitors are used as defense mechanisms. Common examples are the trypsin inhibitors found in the seeds of some plants, most notable for humans being soybeans, a major food crop, where they act to discourage predators. Raw soybeans are toxic to many animals, including humans, until the protease inhibitors they contain have been denatured.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Often credited as an influence on modern music and one of the greatest musicians of his era, he pioneered the Minneapolis sound and was influential in the evolution of various other genres of music.\nBorn and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 18, releasing his first album, \"For You\", two years later. He went on to achieve critical success with his albums \"Dirty Mind\" (1980), \"Controversy\" (1981), and \"1999\" (1982). In 1984, Prince became the first singer to simultaneously have a number-one film, album and single in the US, with the film \"Purple Rain\", its soundtrack, and \"When Doves Cry\", which was the biggest hit single of the year. The album, recorded with his new backing band the Revolution, spent six consecutive months atop the United States \"Billboard\" 200 chart and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince released his first double LP in 1987, titled \"Sign o' the Times\", widely lauded by critics as the greatest work of his career and one of the greatest records in music history.\nIn 1993, in the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros, Prince changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol , known to fans as the \"Love Symbol\". After signing a contract with Arista Records in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000 and continued releasing albums, including the double Grammy Award winning \"Musicology\" (2004). He was a prolific musician who released 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased material. On April 21, 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died after accidentally overdosing on counterfeit hydrocodone/paracetamol pills laced with fentanyl at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. \nPrince has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards include the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the \"Billboard\" Icon Award, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2024, and twice into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022.\nEarly life.\nPrince Rogers Nelson was born at Mount Sinai Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota on June 7, 1958, the son of jazz singer Mattie Della (n\u00e9e Shaw) and pianist and songwriter John Lewis Nelson. All four of his grandparents were from Louisiana. The jazz drummer Louis Hayes was his paternal cousin.\nPrince was named after his father's most popular stage name, Prince Rogers, which was used while performing with Della in a jazz group named the Prince Rogers Trio. In 1991, Prince's father told \"A Current Affair\" that he named his son \"Prince\" because he wanted Prince \"to do everything I wanted to do\". During his childhood, Prince was not fond of his name and used \"Skipper\" instead. Prince said he was \"born epileptic\" and had seizures when he was young. He stated, \"My mother told me one day I walked in to her and said, 'Mom, I'm not going to be sick anymore,' and she said, 'Why?' and I said, 'Because an angel told me so.'\" Prince's younger sister, Tyka, was born on May 18, 1960. Both siblings developed a keen interest in music, which was encouraged by their father. His parents were both members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a Protestant denomination.\nIn 2022, during a Minneapolis teachers' strike, Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul news station WCCO-TV was researching a previous teacher's strike in April 1970 and accidentally uncovered an interview they had done with Prince about that strike. Prince, who was 11 years old at the time, said about the strike, \"I think they should get a better education too cause, um, and I think they should get some more money cause they work, they be working extra hours for us and all that stuff.\" While he never identifies himself in the interview, it was confirmed to be him through interviews with a historian in Minneapolis, as well as by a former classmate who was a member of Prince's first band. The video is one of few videos from his childhood.\nPrince wrote his first song, titled \"Funk Machine\", on his father's piano when he was seven years old. When he was ten, his parents divorced. His mother remarried Hayward Baker, with whom she had a son named Omarr. Prince had a fraught relationship with Omarr, to the extent that it caused him to repeatedly switch homes, sometimes living with his father and sometimes with his mother and stepfather. Baker took Prince to see James Brown in concert, with Prince crediting Baker with improving the family's finances. After a brief period of living with his father, who bought him his first guitar, Prince moved into the basement of the Anderson family, who were his neighbors, after his father threw him out. He befriended the Andersons' son, Andr\u00e9 Cymone, who later collaborated with Prince.\nPrince briefly attended Minneapolis's Bryant Junior High, after which he moved to Central High School where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He played on Central's junior varsity basketball team, and continued to recreationally play basketball as an adult. He was trained in classical ballet at the Minnesota Dance Theatre through the Urban Arts Program of Minneapolis Public Schools. Prince became an advocate for dancers, and used his wealth to save the failing Joffrey Ballet in Chicago during the 1990s. He met songwriter and producer Jimmy Jam in 1973 and impressed Jam with his musical talent, early mastery of a wide range of instruments, and work ethic.\nCareer.\n1975\u20131980: Beginnings and breakthrough.\nIn 1975, Pepe Willie, the husband of one of Prince's cousins, formed the band 94 East with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry, hiring Andr\u00e9 Cymone and Prince to record tracks. Willie wrote the songs, with Prince contributing guitar tracks, both of them co-writing the 94 East song, \"Just Another Sucker\". The band recorded tracks which later appeared in the album \"Minneapolis Genius\u00a0\u2013 The Historic 1977 Recordings\". In 1976, shortly after graduating from Central High School, Prince created a demo tape with producer Chris Moon, in Moon's Minneapolis studio. Unable to secure a recording contract, Moon brought the tape to Owen Husney, a Minneapolis businessman. Husney signed Prince, then aged 19, to a management contract, and helped him create a demo at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis, with producer/engineer David Z. The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney's ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies, including Warner Bros. Records, A&amp;M Records, and Columbia Records.\nWith the help of Husney, Prince signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1977. The record company agreed to give Prince creative control for three albums and retain his publishing rights. Husney and Prince then left Minneapolis and moved to Sausalito, California, where Prince's first album, \"For You\", was recorded at Record Plant Studios. The album was mixed in Los Angeles and released on April 7, 1978. According to the \"For You\" album notes, Prince wrote, produced, arranged, composed, and played all 27 instruments on the recording, except for the song \"Soft and Wet\", whose lyrics were co-written by Moon. The cost of recording the album was twice Prince's initial advance. Prince used the \"Prince's Music Co.\" to publish his songs. In the United States, \"Soft and Wet\" reached No. 12 on the Hot Soul Singles chart and No. 92 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song \"Just as Long as We\u2019re Together\" reached No. 91 on the Hot Soul Singles chart.\nAround this time, a side enterprise that Prince began to pursue involved a then-teenage singer Sue Ann Carwell, whose career as a solo artist he hoped to mold after hearing her talented performance on the Minneapolis R&amp;B scene. However, Carwell resisted his suggestion that she use the name \"Susie Stone\". Recordings he had been working on with her for a projected 1978 album, including \"I'm Saving It Up\", \"Make It Through the Storm\", \"Since We've Been Together\" and \"Wouldn't You Love To Love Me?\", went unreleased. Carwell was subsequently signed by Warner Bros. Records.\nIn 1979, Prince created a band with Andr\u00e9 Cymone on bass, Dez Dickerson on guitar, Gayle Chapman and Doctor Fink on keyboards, and Bobby Z. on drums. Their first show was at the Capri Theater on January 5, 1979. Warner Bros. executives attended the show but decided that Prince and the band needed more time to develop his music. In October 1979, Prince released the album \"Prince\", which reached No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" Top R&amp;B/Black Albums charts and No. 22 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and went platinum. It contained two R&amp;B hits: \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\", which sold more than a million copies, and reached No. 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and stayed at No. 1 for two weeks on the Hot Soul Singles chart. Prince performed both songs on January 26, 1980, on \"American Bandstand\".\n1980\u20131983: \"Dirty Mind\", \"Controversy\" and \"1999\".\nIn 1980, Prince released the album \"Dirty Mind\", which contained sexually explicit material, including the title song \"Head\", and the song \"Sister\", and was described by Stephen Thomas Erlewine as a \"stunning, audacious amalgam of funk, new wave, R&amp;B, and pop, fueled by grinningly salacious sex and the desire to shock\". Recorded in Prince's studio, this album was certified gold, with the single \"Uptown\" reaching No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" Dance chart and No. 5 on the Hot Soul Singles chart. Prince was also the opening act for Rick James' 1980 \"Fire It Up\" tour.\nIn February 1981, Prince made his first appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\", performing \"Partyup\". In October 1981, Prince released the album \"Controversy\". He played several dates in support of it, as the first of three opening acts for the Rolling Stones, on their United States tour. In Los Angeles, Prince, who appeared in a trench coat and black bikini briefs, was forced off the stage after just three songs by audience members throwing trash at him. The songs on \"Controversy\" were published by \"Controversy Music\"\u00a0\u2013 \"ASCAP\", a practice he continued until the \"Emancipation\" album in 1996. \"Controversy\" also marked the introduction of Prince's use of abbreviated spelling, such as writing the words \"you\" as \"U\", \"\"to\" as \"2\", and \"for\" as \"4\"\"; by 2002, MTV News noted that \"now all of his titles, liner notes, and Web postings are written in his own shorthand spelling, as seen on 1999's \"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\", which featured 'Hot Wit U.'\"\nIn 1981, Prince formed a side project band called The Time. The band released four albums between 1981 and 1990, with Prince writing and performing most of the instrumentation and backing vocals\u2014sometimes being credited under the pseudonyms \"Jamie Starr\" or \"The Starr Company\"\u2014with lead vocals by Morris Day.\nIn late 1982, Prince released a double album, \"1999\", which sold more than four million copies. The title track was a protest against nuclear proliferation and became Prince's first top 10 hit in countries outside the United States. Prince's \"Little Red Corvette\" was one of the first two videos by black artists\u2014along with Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\"\u2014played in heavy rotation on MTV, which had been perceived as against \"black music\" until CBS President Walter Yetnikoff threatened to pull all CBS videos. Prince and Jackson had a competitive rivalry which lasted for many years. The song \"Delirious\" also placed in the top ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. \"International Lover\" earned Prince his first Grammy Award nomination at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards.\n1984\u20131987: \"Purple Rain\", \"Around the World in a Day\" and \"Parade\".\nStarting with the release of 1999, the backing band for Prince would be referred to as the Revolution. The band's name was printed in reverse on the cover of \"1999\" inside the letter \"I\" of the word \"Prince\". The band consisted of Lisa Coleman and Doctor Fink on keyboards, Bobby Z. on drums, Brown Mark on bass, and Dez Dickerson on guitar. Jill Jones, a backing singer, was also part of the lineup for the \"1999\" album and tour. Following the tour, Dickerson left the group for religious reasons. In the book \"Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince\" (2003), author Alex Hahn says that Dickerson was reluctant to sign a three-year contract and wanted to pursue other musical ventures. Dickerson was replaced by Coleman's friend Wendy Melvoin. At first, the band was used sparsely in the studio, but this gradually changed during 1983.\nAccording to his former manager Bob Cavallo, in the early 1980s, Prince required his management to obtain a deal for him to star in a major motion picture, even though his exposure at that point was limited to several pop and R&amp;B hits, music videos and occasional TV performances. In 1984, this resulted in the hit film \"Purple Rain\"\u2014which starred Prince and was loosely autobiographical\u2014and the eponymous studio album, which was also the soundtrack to the film. The \"Purple Rain\" album sold more than 13 million copies in the United States and spent 24 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The film won Prince an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and grossed more than $68\u00a0million in the US, or $\u00a0million in 2024 dollars. It is regarded as one of the greatest musical films. Songs from the film were hits on pop charts around the world; \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, with the title track reaching No. 2. At one point in 1984, Prince simultaneously had the No. 1 album, single, and film in the United States, being the first singer to achieve this feat. The \"Purple Rain\" album is ranked 8th in \"Rolling Stone\"'s \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", and is also included on the list of \"Time\"'s All-Time 100 Albums. The album also produced two of Prince's first three Grammy Awards earned at the 27th Annual Grammy Awards: Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.\nIn 1984, pop artist Andy Warhol created the painting \"Orange Prince\". Warhol was fascinated by Prince and ultimately created a total of twelve unique paintings of him in different colorways, all of which were kept in Warhol's personal collection. Four of these paintings are now in the collection of The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. In November 1984, \"Vanity Fair\" published Warhol's portrait to accompany the article \"Purple Fame\" by Tristan Fox, and claimed that Warhol's silkscreen image of Prince with its pop colors captured the recording artist \"at the height of his powers\".\nAfter Tipper Gore heard her 11-year-old daughter Karenna listening to Prince's song \"Darling Nikki\", which gained wide notoriety for its sexual lyrics and a reference to masturbation, she founded the Parents Music Resource Center. The center advocated the mandatory use of a warning label, now known as Parental Advisory, on the covers of records that have been judged to contain language or lyrical content unsuitable for minors. The recording industry later voluntarily complied with this request.\nIn 1985, Prince released \"Around the World in a Day\", which held the No. 1 spot on the \"Billboard\" 200 for three weeks. From that album, the single \"Raspberry Beret\" reached No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and \"Pop Life\" reached No. 7.\nIn 1986, his album \"Parade\", the soundtrack for the movie \"Under the Cherry Moon\" released in the same year, reached No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and No. 2 on the R&amp;B charts. The first single, \"Kiss\", with its video choreographed by Louis Falco, reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In the same year, the song \"Manic Monday\", written by Prince and recorded by the Bangles, reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 chart. \nAlthough the \"Parade\" album went platinum and sold two million copies, the film received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture, tied with \"Howard the Duck\", and Prince received Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Director, Worst Actor, and Worst Original Song for the song \"Love or Money\". Some critics later re-evaluated \"Under the Cherry Moon\" after Prince's death and declared it a cult classic, comparing it to films such as \"8\u00bd\", \"Casablanca\" and \"It Happened One Night\".\nIn 1986, Prince began a series of live performances called the Parade Tour. After the tour, Prince disbanded the Revolution and fired Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman. Brown Mark also quit the band, with only keyboardist Doctor Fink remaining. Following this, Miko Weaver, Atlanta Bliss, and Eric Leeds joined the band.\n1987\u20131989: \"Sign o' the Times\" and \"Lovesexy\".\nBefore disbanding the Revolution, Prince was working on two separate projects, an album with The Revolution titled \"Dream Factory,\" and a solo album named \"Camille\". Unlike the three previous band albums, \"Dream Factory\" included input from the band members and featured songs with lead vocals by Wendy &amp; Lisa. The \"Camille\" project saw Prince create a new androgynous persona primarily singing in a sped-up, female-sounding voice. With the dismissal of the Revolution, Prince consolidated material from both shelved albums, along with other songs, into a three-LP album to be titled \"Crystal Ball\". Warner Bros. forced Prince to trim the triple album to a double album, releasing \"Sign o' the Times\" on March 31, 1987.\nThe album peaked at No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart. The first single, \"Sign o' the Times\", charted at No. 3 on the Hot 100. The follow-up single, \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\", charted at No. 67 on the Hot 100 but reached No. 12 on R&amp;B chart. The third single, a duet with Sheena Easton, \"U Got the Look\", charted at No. 2 on the Hot 100 and No. 11 on the R&amp;B chart, and the final single, \"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man\", charted at No. 10 on Hot 100 and No. 14 on the R&amp;B chart. It was named the top album of the year by the Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll and sold 3.2\u00a0million copies. In Europe, it performed well, with Prince promoting the album with a lengthy tour. Putting together a new backing band from the remnants of the Revolution, Prince added bassist Levi Seacer Jr., keyboardist Boni Boyer, and dancer/choreographer Cat Glover with drummer Sheila E. and holdovers Miko Weaver, Doctor Fink, Eric Leeds, Atlanta Bliss, and the Bodyguards Wally Safford and Greg Brooks for the Sign o' the Times Tour.\nThe Sign o' the Times tour was a success overseas, with Warner Bros. and Prince's managers wanting to bring it to the United States to promote sales of the album. Prince did not approve of a full United States tour, as he was ready to produce a new album. As a compromise, the last two nights of the tour were filmed for release in movie theaters. The film quality was deemed subpar, and reshoots were performed at Prince's Paisley Park studios. The film \"Sign o' the Times\" was released on November 20, 1987. The film got better reviews than \"Under the Cherry Moon\", but its box-office receipts were minimal, and it quickly left theaters.\nThe next album intended for release was \"The Black Album\". More instrumental and funk- and R&amp;B-themed than recent releases, \"The Black Album\" also saw Prince experiment with hip hop on the songs \"Bob George\" and \"Dead on It\". Prince was set to release the album with a monochromatic black cover with only the catalog number printed, but after 500,000 copies had been pressed, Prince had a spiritual epiphany that the album was \"evil\" and had it recalled. Surviving vinyl copies of the album have sold for upwards of $10\u00a0thousand. \"The Black Album\" was re-released in 1994.\nPrince went back in the studio for eight weeks and recorded \"Lovesexy\". Released on May 10, 1988, \"Lovesexy\" serves as a spiritual opposite to the dark \"The Black Album\". Every song is a solo effort by Prince, except \"Eye No\", which was recorded with his backing band at the time. \"Lovesexy\" reached No. 11 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and No. 5 on the R&amp;B albums chart. The lead single, \"Alphabet St.\", peaked at No. 8 on the Hot 100 and No. 3 on the R&amp;B chart, selling 750,000 copies. Prince again took his post-Revolution backing band, excluding the Bodyguards, on a three-leg, 84-show Lovesexy World Tour; although the shows were well-received by huge crowds, they failed to make a net profit due to the expensive sets and props.\n1989\u20131991: \"Batman\" and \"Graffiti Bridge\".\nIn 1989, Prince appeared on Madonna's studio album \"Like a Prayer\", co-writing and singing the duet \"Love Song\" and playing electric guitar without being credited on the songs \"Like a Prayer\", \"Keep It Together\", and \"Act of Contrition\". He also began work on several musical projects, including \"Rave Unto the Joy Fantastic\" and early drafts of his \"Graffiti Bridge\" film, but both were put on hold when he was asked by \"Batman\" director Tim Burton to record several songs for the upcoming live-action adaptation. Prince went into the studio and produced an entire nine-track album that Warner Bros. released on June 20, 1989.\n\"Batman\"'s soundtrack peaked at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 4.3\u00a0million copies. The single \"Batdance\" topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts. The single \"The Arms of Orion\", with Sheena Easton, charted at No. 36, and \"Partyman\" charted at No. 18 on the Hot 100 and at No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart, while the love ballad \"Scandalous!\" went to No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart. Prince had to sign away all publishing rights to the songs on the album to Warner Bros. as part of the deal to do the soundtrack.\nIn 1990, Prince went back on tour with a revamped band for his back-to-basics Nude Tour. With the departures of Boni Boyer, Sheila E., the Horns, and Cat, Prince brought in keyboardist Rosie Gaines, drummer Michael Bland, and dancing trio \"the Game Boyz\" (Tony M., Kirky J., and Damon Dickson). The European and Japanese tour was a financial success with a short, greatest hits setlist. In 1990, Prince finished production on his fourth film, \"Graffiti Bridge\", and its soundtrack. Initially, Warner Bros. was reluctant to fund the film, but with Prince's assurances it would be a sequel to \"Purple Rain,\" as well as the involvement of the original members of the Time, the studio greenlit the project.\nReleased on August 20, 1990, the album reached No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and R&amp;B albums chart. The single \"Thieves in the Temple\" reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart, with \"Round and Round\" placing at No. 12 on the United States charts and No. 2 on the R&amp;B charts. The song featured the teenage Tevin Campbell, who also had a role in the film, on lead vocals. The film, released on November 20, 1990, was a box-office flop, grossing $4.2\u00a0million. Miko Weaver and Doctor Fink, the last remaining members of the Revolution, would leave Prince's band shortly after. \n1991\u20131996: Name change, \"Diamonds and Pearls\" and \"The Gold Experience\".\n1991 began with a performance in Rock in Rio II, marking the debut of Prince's new band, the New Power Generation. With guitarist Miko Weaver and long-time keyboardist Doctor Fink leaving, Prince added bass player Sonny T., keyboard player Tommy Barbarella, and a brass section known as the Hornheads to go along with Levi Seacer, who would be taking over on guitar, Rosie Gaines, Michael Bland, and \"the Game Boyz\". With significant input from his band members, \"Diamonds and Pearls\" was released on October 1, 1991. Reaching No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, \"Diamonds and Pearls\" saw four hit singles released in the United States. \"Gett Off\" peaked at No. 21 on the Hot 100 and No. 6 on the R&amp;B charts, followed by \"Cream\", which gave Prince his fifth United States No. 1 single. The title track \"Diamonds and Pearls\" became the album's third single, reaching No. 3 on the Hot 100 and the top spot on the R&amp;B charts. \"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\" peaked at No. 23 and No. 14 on the Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts respectively. \"Diamonds and Pearls\" would sell more than 2 million copies in the United States alone.\nIn 1992, following the success of \"Diamonds and Pearls\", Prince renewed his contract with Warner Bros., agreeing to what was reportedly a $100 million deal to release six more albums with the label. In October, Prince released his 14th studio album, named , being the second to feature the New Power Generation. It bore only an unpronounceable symbol on the cover, which would later be copyrighted as \"Love Symbol #2\", as its title; the symbol was explained as being a combination of the symbols for male (\u2642) and female (\u2640). It was preceded by the releases of the singles \"Sexy MF\" and \"My Name Is Prince\", which reached No. 66 and No. 36 respectively on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The third single, \"7\" would peak at No. 7 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The album, later referred to as \"Love Symbol\", peaked at No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and went on to sell 2.8 million copies worldwide, falling short of expectations.\nIn 1993, in rebellion against Warner Bros., which refused to release Prince's enormous backlog of music at a steady pace, Prince formally adopted as his stage name. To use the symbol in print media, Warner Bros. organized a mass mailing of floppy disks with a custom font. At this time, Prince was often referred to as \"the Artist Formerly Known as Prince\" or \"the Artist\". That same year, Warner Bros. released a greatest hits compilation with the three-disc \"The Hits/The B-Sides\" in 1993. The first two discs were also sold separately as \"The Hits 1\" and \"The Hits 2\". The collection features the majority of Prince's hit singles, and several previously hard-to-find recordings, including B-sides from across Prince's career and previously unreleased tracks such as the Revolution-recorded \"Power Fantastic\" and a live recording of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" with Rosie Gaines. Two new songs, \"Pink Cashmere\" and \"Peach\", were chosen as promotional singles.\nIn 1994, Warner Bros. allowed the single \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\" to be released via independent distributor Bellmark Records in February. The release reached No. 3 on the United States \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 1 in many other countries. Prince began to release albums in quick succession as a means of releasing himself from his contractual obligations to Warner Bros. This led to the previously aborted \"Black Album\" being given a limited official release seven years after its initial recording. Prince pushed to have his next two albums, \"Come\" and \"The Gold Experience\", released simultaneously. Warner Bros. accepted both albums, but delayed the release of \"The Gold Experience\", fearing market saturation. In retaliation, Prince began making public appearances with \"slave\" written on his face. \"The Gold Experience\" would not be released until September 1995. The album was not in print for a long period due to a plagiarism case relating to \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\", but the album was released on streaming platforms with Prince\u2019s catalog in 2018, and reissued on CD and vinyl in 2022.\nIn 1996, the album \"Chaos and Disorder\" was released. Prince submitted another album titled \"\" to Warner Bros. that same year, completing his contract with the label. Although the album was not released until 1999, Warner Bros. agreed to release Prince from his contract now that he had delivered the promised number of albums to them.\n1996\u20132000: \"Emancipation\", \"Crystal Ball\" and \"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\".\nFree of any further contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Prince attempted a major comeback later that year with the release of \"Emancipation\", a 36-song, three-CD set, with each disc being exactly 60 minutes long. The album was released via his own label, named NPG Records, with distribution through EMI. \"Emancipation\" was certified Platinum by the RIAA. It is the first Prince record featuring covers of other artists' songs. Prince covered Joan Osborne's top ten hit song of 1995 \"One of Us\", Thom Bell and Linda Creed's \"Betcha by Golly Wow!\", James Allen Shamblin II and Michael Barry Reid's \"I Can't Make You Love Me\", and Thom Bell and William Hart's \"La-La (Means I Love You)\".\nPrince released \"Crystal Ball\", a five-CD collection of unreleased material, in 1998. The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was shipped; these pre-orders were delivered months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The retail edition has only four discs, as it is missing the \"Kamasutra\" disc. There are also two different packaging editions for retail; one is a four-disc sized jewel case with a white cover and the Love Symbol in a colored circle, while the other contains all four discs in a round translucent snap jewel case. The discs are the same, as is the CD jacket. The \"Newpower Soul\" album was released three months later. His collaborations on Chaka Khan's \"Come 2 My House\" and Larry Graham's \"GCS2000\", both released on the NPG label around the same time as \"Newpower Soul\", were promoted by live appearances on \"Vibe with Sinbad\" and the NBC \"Today\" show's Summer Concert Series.\nIn 1999, Prince once again signed with a major label, Arista Records, to release a new record, \"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\". The pay-per-view concert, \"Rave Un2 the Year 2000\", was broadcast on December 31, 1999, and consisted of footage from the December 17 and 18 concerts of his 1999 tour. The concert featured appearances by guest musicians, including Lenny Kravitz, George Clinton, Jimmy Russell, and the Time. It was released to home video the following year.\n2000\u20132004: Internet releases and \"Musicology\".\nOn May 16, 2000, Prince stopped using the Love Symbol as his name, since his publishing contract with Warner/Chappell had expired. In a press conference, he stated that after being freed from undesirable relationships associated with the name \"Prince\", he would revert to using his real name. Nevertheless, Prince continued to use the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and to play a Love Symbol\u2013shaped guitar. For several years following the release of \"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\", Prince primarily released new music through his Internet subscription service, NPGOnlineLtd.com, which later became NPGMusicClub.com. The albums released during this period include remix album \"Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic\" and \"The Rainbow Children\" in 2001, \"One Nite Alone...\" in 2002, and \"Xpectation\" in 2003.\nIn 2001, Warner Bros. released a second compilation album, \"The Very Best of Prince\", containing most of his commercially successful singles from the 1980s. In 2002, Prince released his first live album, \"One Nite Alone... Live!\", which features performances from the One Nite Alone...Tour. The three-CD box set also includes a disc of \"aftershow\" music entitled \"It Ain't Over!\". During this time, Prince sought to engage more effectively with his fan base via the NPG Music Club, pre-concert sound checks, and at yearly \"celebrations\" at Paisley Park. Fans were invited into the studio for tours, interviews, discussions and music-listening sessions. Some of these fan discussions were filmed for an unreleased documentary, directed by Kevin Smith.\nOn February 8, 2004, Prince appeared at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards with Beyonc\u00e9. In a performance that opened the show, they performed a medley of \"Purple Rain\", \"Let's Go Crazy\", \"Baby I'm a Star\", and Beyonc\u00e9's \"Crazy in Love\". The following month, Prince was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The award was presented to him by Alicia Keys along with Big Boi and Andr\u00e9 3000 of OutKast. As well as performing a trio of his own hits during the ceremony, Prince also participated in a tribute to fellow inductee George Harrison in a rendering of Harrison's \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", playing a two-minute guitar solo that ended the song. He also performed the song \"Red House\" as \"Purple House\" on the album \"\".\nIn April 2004, Prince released \"Musicology\" through a one-album agreement with Columbia. The album rose as high as the top five on some international charts (including the US, UK, Germany, and Australia). The United States chart success was assisted by the CDs being included as part of the concert ticket purchase, thereby qualifying each CD (as chart rules then stood) to count toward United States chart placement. Three months later, \"Spin\" named him the greatest frontman of all time. That same year, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine named Prince as the highest-earning musician in the world, with an annual income of $56.5\u00a0million, largely due to his Musicology Tour, which Pollstar named as the top concert draw among musicians in the US. He played 96 concerts; the average ticket price for a show was US$61 (). \"Musicology\" went on to receive two Grammy wins, for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for \"Call My Name\" and Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the title track. \"Musicology\" was also nominated for Best R&amp;B Song and Best R&amp;B Album, and \"Cinnamon Girl\" was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Prince No. 27 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\n2005\u20132007: \"Musicology\".\nIn April 2005, Prince played guitar (along with En Vogue singing backing vocals) on Stevie Wonder's single \"So What the Fuss\", Wonder's first since 1999. In late 2005, Prince signed with Universal Music to release his album, \"3121\", on March 21, 2006. The first single was \"Te Amo Coraz\u00f3n\", the video for which was directed by actress Salma Hayek and filmed in Marrakesh, Morocco, featuring Argentine actress and singer M\u00eda Maestro. The video for the second single, \"Black Sweat\", was nominated at the MTV VMAs for Best Cinematography. The immediate success of \"3121\" gave Prince his first No. 1 debut on the \"Billboard\" 200 with the album.\nTo promote the new album, Prince was the musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\" on February 4, 2006, 17 years after his last \"SNL\" appearance on the 15th-anniversary special, and nearly 25 years since his first appearance on a regular episode in 1981. At the 2006 Webby Awards on June 12, Prince received a Webby Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his \"visionary use of the Internet to distribute music and connect with audiences\", exemplified by his decision to release his album \"Crystal Ball\" (1998) exclusively online.\nIn July 2006, weeks after winning a Webby Award, Prince shut down his NPG Music Club website, after more than five years of operation. On the day of the music club's shutdown, a lawsuit was filed against Prince by the British company HM Publishing (owners of the Nature Publishing Group, also NPG). Despite these events occurring on the same day, Prince's attorney stated that the site did not close due to the trademark dispute. Prince appeared at multiple award ceremonies in 2006: on February 15, he performed at the 2006 Brit Awards, along with Wendy &amp; Lisa and Sheila E., and on June 27, Prince appeared at the 2006 BET Awards, where he was awarded Best Male R&amp;B Artist. Prince performed a medley of Chaka Khan songs for Khan's BET Lifetime Achievement Award.\nIn November 2006, Prince was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame; he appeared to collect his award but did not perform. Also in November 2006, Prince opened a nightclub called 3121, in Las Vegas at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino. He performed weekly on Friday and Saturday nights until April 2007, when his contract with the Rio ended. On August 22, 2006, Prince released \"Ultimate Prince\". The double-disc set contains one CD of previous hits, and another of extended versions and mixes of material that had largely only previously been available on vinyl record B-sides. That same year, Prince wrote and performed a song for the hit animated film \"Happy Feet\" (2006). The song \u2013 \"The Song of the Heart\" \u2013 appears on the film's , which also features a cover of Prince's earlier hit \"Kiss\", sung by Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. In January 2007, \"The Song of the Heart\" won a Golden Globe for Best Original Song.\n2007\u20132010: Super Bowl XLI show, \"Planet Earth\" and \"Lotusflower\".\nOn February 4, 2007, Prince played at the Super Bowl XLI halftime show in Miami, Florida, on a large stage shaped like his symbol. The event was carried to 140\u00a0million television viewers, his biggest-ever audience. His 12-minute performance in the rain began with an intro of the Queen song \"We Will Rock You\" and concluded with \"Purple Rain\". In 2015, \"Billboard\" ranked it the greatest Super Bowl performance ever.\nPrince played 21 concerts at the O2 Arena in London during the Earth Tour in mid-2007. Tickets for the 20,000-capacity venue were capped by Prince at \u00a331.21 ($48.66). Featuring Maceo Parker in his band, Prince's residency at the O2 Arena was increased to 15 nights after all 140,000 tickets for the original seven sold out in 20 minutes, before it was then further extended to 21 nights.\nPrince performed with Sheila E. at the 2007 ALMA Awards. On June 28, 2007, the \"Mail on Sunday\" stated that it had made a deal to give Prince's new album, \"Planet Earth\", away for free with the paper, making it the first place in the world to get the album. This move sparked controversy among music distributors and also led the UK arm of Prince's distributor, Sony BMG, to withdraw from distributing the album in UK stores. The UK's largest high street music retailer, HMV, stocked the paper on release day due to the giveaway. On July 7, 2007, Prince returned to Minneapolis to perform three shows. He performed concerts at the Macy's Auditorium (to promote his new perfume \"3121\") on Nicollet Mall, the Target Center arena, and First Avenue. It was the first time he had played at First Avenue (the club appeared in the film \"Purple Rain\") since 1987.\nFrom 2008, Prince was managed by UK-based Kiran Sharma. On April 25, 2008, Prince performed on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", where he debuted a new song, \"Turn Me Loose\". Days after, he headlined the 2008 Coachella Festival. Prince was paid more than $5\u00a0million for his performance at Coachella, according to Reuters. Prince canceled a concert, planned at Dublin's Croke Park on June 16, 2008, at 10 days' notice. In October 2009 promoters MCD Productions went to court to sue him for \u20ac1.6\u00a0million to refund 55,126 tickets. Prince settled the case out of court in February 2010 for $2.95\u00a0million. During the trial, it was said that Prince had been offered $22\u00a0million for seven concerts as part of a proposed 2008 European tour. In October 2008, Prince released a live album entitled \"Indigo Nights\", a collection of songs performed live at aftershows in the IndigO2.\nPrince premiered four songs from his new album on LA's Indie rock radio station Indie 103.1 on December 18, 2008. The radio station's programmers Max Tolkoff and Mark Sovel had been invited to Prince's home to hear the new rock-oriented music. Prince gave them a CD with four songs to premiere on their radio station. The music debuted the next day on Jonesy's Jukebox, hosted by former Sex Pistol Steve Jones.\nOn January 3, 2009, the new website LotusFlow3r.com was launched; streaming and selling some of the recently aired material and concert tickets. On January 31, Prince released two more songs on LotusFlow3r.com: \"Disco Jellyfish\", and \"Another Boy\". \"Chocolate Box\", \"Colonized Mind\", and \"All This Love\" were later released on the website. Prince released a triple album set containing \"Lotusflower\", \"MPLSoUND\", and an album credited to Bria Valente, called \"Elixer\", on March 24, 2009, followed by a physical release on March 29.\nOn July 18, 2009, Prince performed two shows at the Montreux Jazz Festival, backed by the New Power Generation, including Rhonda Smith, Renato Neto and John Blackwell. On October 11, 2009, he gave two surprise concerts at the Grand Palais in Paris. On October 12, he gave another surprise performance at La Cigale. On October 24, Prince played a concert at Paisley Park.\n2010\u20132016: Final albums.\nIn January 2010, Prince wrote a new song, \"Purple and Gold\", inspired by his visit to a Minnesota Vikings football game against the Dallas Cowboys. The following month, he let Minneapolis-St. Paul public radio station 89.3 The Current premiere his new song \"Cause and Effect\" as a gesture in support of independent radio.\nIn 2010, Prince was listed in \"Time\"'s annual ranking of the \"100 Most Influential People in the World\". He released a new single on Minneapolis-St. Paul radio station 89.3 The Current called \"Hot Summer\" on June 7, his 52nd birthday. The same month, Prince appeared on the cover of the July 2010 issue of \"Ebony\" magazine, and he received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2010 BET Awards.\nPrince released his album \"20Ten\" in July 2010 as a free covermount with publications in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and France. He refused album access to digital download services and closed LotusFlow3r.com. On July 4, 2010, Prince began his 20Ten Tour, a concert tour in two legs, with shows in Europe. The second leg began on October 15 and ended with a concert following the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on November 14. The second half of the tour had a new band, John Blackwell, Ida Kristine Nielsen, and Sheila E. Prince let radio station Europe 1 debut the snippet of his new song \"Rich Friends\" from the new album \"20Ten Deluxe\" on October 8, 2010. He embarked on the Welcome 2 Tour on December 15, 2010. Prince was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame on December 7, 2010.\nPrince presented Barbra Streisand with an award and donated $1.5\u00a0million to charities on February 12, 2011. On the same day, it was reported that he had not authorized the television show \"Glee\" to cover his hit \"Kiss\", in an episode that had already been filmed. Prince headlined the Hop Farm Festival on July 3, 2011, marking his first UK show since 2007 and his first-ever UK festival appearance. Despite having previously rejected the Internet for music distribution, on November 24, 2011, he released a reworked version of the previously unreleased song \"Extraloveable\" through both iTunes and Spotify. Purple Music, a Switzerland-based record label, released a CD single titled \"Dance 4 Me\" on December 12, 2011, as part of a club remixes package including the Bria Valente CD single \"2 Nite\" released on February 23, 2012. The CD features club remixes by Jamie Lewis and David Alexander, produced by Prince.\nIn January 2013, Prince released a lyric video for a new song called \"Screwdriver\". In April 2013, Prince announced a West Coast tour titled Live Out Loud Tour with 3rdeyegirl as his backing band. The final two dates of the first leg of the tour were in Minneapolis-St. Paul, where former Revolution drummer Bobby Z. sat in as guest drummer on both shows. In May, Prince announced a deal with Kobalt Music to market and distribute his music. On August 14, 2013, Prince released a new solo single for download through the 3rdeyegirl.com website. The single \"Breakfast Can Wait\" had cover art featuring comedian Dave Chappelle's impersonation of him, from a 2004 second-season \"Chappelle's Show\" comedy sketch on Comedy Central.\nIn February 2014, he performed concerts with 3rdeyegirl in London titled the Hit and Run Tour. Beginning with intimate shows, the first was held at the London home of singer Lianne La Havas, followed by two performances of what Prince described as a \"sound check\" at the Electric Ballroom in Camden, and another at Shepherd's Bush Empire. On April 18, 2014, Prince released a new single entitled \"The Breakdown\". He re-signed with his former label, Warner Bros. Records after an 18-year split. Warner announced that Prince would release a remastered deluxe edition of \"Purple Rain\" in 2014 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album. In return, Warner gave Prince ownership of the master recordings of his recordings with the company.\nIn February 2014, Prince began what was billed as his \"Hit N Run Part One\" tour. This involved Prince's Twitter followers keeping an avid eye on second-by-second information as to the whereabouts of his shows. Many of these shows would only be announced on the day of the concert, and many of these concerts involved two performances: a matinee and an evening show. These shows began at Camden's Electric Ballroom, billed as \"Soundchecks\", and spread throughout the UK capital to KoKo Club, in Camden, Shepherd's Bush Empire and various other small venues. After his London dates, he moved on to other European cities. In May 2014, Prince began his \"Hit N Run Part Two\" shows, which followed a more normal style of purchasing tickets online and being held in music arenas. In Spring 2014, he launched NPG Publishing, a music company to administer his own music and that of other artists without the restrictions of mainstream record companies.\nIn May 2015, following the killing of Freddie Gray in police custody and the subsequent riots, Prince released a song, \"Baltimore\", in tribute to Gray and in support of the protesters in that city. He also held a tribute concert for Gray at his Paisley Park estate called \"Dance Rally 4 Peace\" in which he encouraged fans to wear the color gray in honor of Freddie Gray. On May 10, he performed a special concert at the Royal Farms Arena in Baltimore called \"Rally 4 Peace\", which featured a special appearance by Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, and one set performed by Prince alone at a keyboard.\nPrince's penultimate album, \"Hit n Run Phase One\", was first made available on September 7, 2015, on the music streaming service Tidal before being released on CD and for download on September 14. His final album, \"Hit n Run Phase Two\", was meant as a continuation of this, and was released on Tidal for streaming and download on December 12, 2015. In February 2016, Prince embarked on the Piano &amp; A Microphone Tour, a tour that saw his show stripped back to only him and a custom piano on stage. He performed a series of warm-up shows at Paisley Park in late January 2016 and the tour commenced in Melbourne, Australia, on February 16, 2016, to critical acclaim. The Australian and New Zealand legs of the tour were played in small-capacity venues, including the Sydney Opera House. \"Hit n Run Phase Two\" CDs were distributed to every attendee after each performance. The tour continued to the United States but was abruptly cut short by illness in April 2016.\nIllness and death.\nPrince saw Doctor Michael T. Schulenberg, a local specialist in family medicine, in Excelsior on April 7, 2016, and again on April 20. On April 7, he postponed two performances at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta from his Piano &amp; a Microphone Tour; the venue released a statement saying he had influenza. He rescheduled and performed what was to be his final show on April 14, despite still not feeling well. While flying back to the Twin Cities early the next morning, he became unresponsive, and his private jet made an emergency landing at Quad Cities International Airport in Moline, Illinois, where he was hospitalized and received naloxone, a medication used to block the effects of opioids, especially following an overdose. Once he became conscious, he left against medical advice. Representatives said he was dehydrated and had had influenza for several weeks. Prince was seen cycling the next day in his hometown of Chanhassen. He shopped that evening at the Electric Fetus in Minneapolis for Record Store Day and made a brief appearance at an impromptu dance party at his Paisley Park recording studio complex, stating that he was feeling fine. On April 19, he attended a performance by singer Lizz Wright at the Dakota Jazz Club.\nOn April 20, 2016, Prince's representatives called Howard Kornfeld, a California specialist in addiction medicine and pain management, seeking medical help for the star. Kornfeld scheduled to meet with him on April 22, and he contacted a local physician who cleared his schedule for an exam on April 21. On April 21, at 9:43\u00a0am, the Carver County Sheriff's Office received a 911 call requesting an ambulance be sent to Prince's home at Paisley Park. The caller initially told the dispatcher that an unidentified person at the home was unconscious, then moments later said he was dead, and finally identified the person as Prince. The caller was Kornfeld's son, who had flown in with buprenorphine that morning to devise a treatment plan for opioid addiction. Emergency responders found Prince unresponsive in an elevator and performed CPR, but a paramedic said he had already been dead for at least six hours, and they were unable to revive him. They pronounced him dead at 10:07\u00a0am, 19 minutes after their arrival. There were no signs of suicide or foul play. A press release from the Midwest Medical Examiner's Office in Anoka County on June 2 stated that Prince had died of an accidental overdose of fentanyl, at the age of 57.\nThe fentanyl that led to his overdose was laced in counterfeit hydrocodone/paracetamol pills. The question of how and from what source Prince obtained the drug was the subject of investigations by several law enforcement agencies. A sealed search warrant was issued for his estate, and another unsealed search warrant was issued for the local Walgreens pharmacy. On April 19, 2018, the Carver County Attorney announced that the multi-agency investigation had ended with no criminal charges filed. The investigation did reveal that Prince was addicted to opioids.\nFollowing an autopsy performed by A. Quinn Strobl, Prince's remains were cremated. On April 26, 2016, Prince's sister Tyka Nelson filed court documents in Carver County, to open a probate case, stating that no will had been found. As of his death, the twice-divorced Prince was neither married nor known to have fathered any surviving children. Under Minnesota law, the absence of a will meant that, in addition to his full sister, Prince's five half-siblings also had a claim to an estate totaling millions of dollars in cash as well as real estate, stocks, and cars. Within three weeks of his death, 700 people claimed to be half-siblings or descendants. Bremer Trust was given temporary control of his estate, had his vault drilled open, and was authorized to obtain a blood sample for DNA profiling from the coroner who had performed the autopsy.\nPrince's ashes were placed into a custom 3D-printed urn shaped like the Paisley Park estate. The urn, which was co-designed by his sister Tyka and her son President, was placed on display in the atrium of the Paisley Park complex in October 2016. As of April\u00a02019[ [update]], no additional estate claimants were recognized by the courts besides Prince's full sister and five half-siblings. It was reported in August 2022 that the Prince estate had settled. Filings in the Minnesota First Judicial District ordered that the cash in Prince's estate be split evenly between Prince Legacy LLC and Prince OAT Holdings LLC.\nRemembrances and reactions.\nNumerous musicians and cultural figures reacted to Prince's death. President Obama mourned him, and the United States Senate passed a resolution praising his achievements \"as a musician, composer, innovator, and cultural icon\". Cities across the U.S. held tributes and vigils, and lit buildings, bridges, and other structures in purple. In the first five hours after the media reported his death, \"Prince\" was the top trending (most-used) term on Twitter, and Facebook had 61\u00a0million Prince-related interactions. AMC Theatres and Carmike Cinemas screened \"Purple Rain\" in select theaters over the following week. \"Saturday Night Live\" aired an episode in his honor, titled \"Goodnight, Sweet Prince\", featuring his performances from the show.\nNielsen Music reported that sales of his material spiked 42,000 percent. The artist's catalog sold 4.41\u00a0million albums and songs from April 21 to 28, with five albums simultaneously in the top ten of the \"Billboard\" 200, a first in the chart's history. At the 59th Grammy Awards, Morris Day with the Time and Bruno Mars performed a tribute.\nThe May 2, 2016, cover of \"The New Yorker\" featured an illustration of purple rain. In June 2016 \"Vanity Fair\"/Cond\u00e9 Nast, released a special edition commemorative magazine, \"The Genius of Prince\". It celebrated the star's life and achievements, with new photography and archive articles, including the original \"Vanity Fair\" article from November 1984, written in the wake of the singer-songwriter's breakout success, with other content from the magazine, \"The New Yorker\", \"Wired\", and \"Pitchfork\". The cover of \"The Genius of Prince\" featured a portrait by Andy Warhol, \"Orange Prince\" (1984). Casts of the musicals \"The Color Purple\" and \"Hamilton\" paid tribute to the star during their curtain calls with \"Purple Rain\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\", respectively.\nIn 2016, Minnesota representative Joe Atkins introduced a bill in the state legislature to memorialize Prince with a statue in the National Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol, in recognition of his contributions to music and the state of Minnesota. As of 2020, however, the bill has not had a second reading.\nOn August 21, 2016, Prince was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame.\nPosthumous projects.\n2016\u20132019.\nThe first posthumous release from the Estate was \"4Ever\" on November 22, 2016. It was a compilation of Prince's hits plus one previously unreleased song, \"Moonbeam Levels\", originally recorded for the \"1999\" sessions in 1982.\nOn February 9, 2017, Prince's estate signed a distribution deal with Universal Music Group, which includes the post-1995 recordings on his NPG Records label and unreleased tracks from his vault. On June 27, Comerica (acting on behalf of the estate) requested that Carver County District Judge Kevin Eide cancel the estate's deal with Universal, as UMG's contract would interfere with a contract with Warner Music Group that Prince signed in 2014. After Universal's attorneys were granted access to the Warner contract, the attorneys also offered to cancel the deal. On July 13, the court voided Universal's deal with Prince's estate, though Universal will continue to administer Prince's songwriting credits and create merchandise.\nOn April 19, an EP featuring six unreleased Prince recordings, \"Deliverance\", was announced with an expected release date for later that week. The next day, Prince's estate was granted a temporary restraining order against George Ian Boxill, an engineer who co-produced the tracks and was in possession of the master tapes, and halted the release of the EP.\nOn June 23, a deluxe reissue of \"Purple Rain\" was released. The most expansive edition contained the first being a remaster of the original album made in 2015 and overseen by Prince himself, a bonus disc of previously unheard material called \"From the Vault &amp; Previously Unreleased\" plus single and maxi-single edits, B-sides and the first DVD issue of \"Prince and the Revolution: Live\" recorded in Syracuse on the \"Purple Rain\" Tour. The album debuted at No. 4 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and at No. 1 on both the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B Albums and Vinyl Albums charts.\nIn April 2018, the previously unreleased original recording of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" from 1984 was released as a single. A music video was also released consisting of edited rehearsal footage shot in the summer of 1984. Troy Carter, adviser for Prince's estate, later announced in an interview with \"Variety\" that a full-length album was planned for release on September 28.\nIn June of that year, the Prince estate signed a distribution deal with Sony Music Entertainment including the rights to all of Prince's studio albums, plus unreleased music, remixes, live recordings, music videos and B-sides. From 2021 onwards, Prince's Warner Bros. albums from 1978\u20131996 are distributed by Sony/Legacy Recordings in the United States, with Warner Music Group still controlling the international rights.\nOn August 17, all 23 post-Warner Bros. albums by Prince were released digitally on streaming platforms, together with a new compilation album entitled \"\". Only one song remained unavailable to stream, \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\", due to a plagiarism lawsuit in Italy that was not resolved until 2022. On September 21, \"Piano and a Microphone 1983\" was released, an intimate recording of Prince privately rehearsing with a piano.\nThe Sony/Legacy reissues began in 2019. Throughout that year, \"Musicology\", \"3121\", \"Planet Earth\", \"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\", \"Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic\", \"Chaos and Disorder\" and \"Emancipation\" were reissued on CD and vinyl. \"Ultimate Rave\" was also released, a 2 CD and 1 DVD set which included the concert film of \"Rave Un2 the Year 2000\". \"The Versace Experience - Prelude 2 Gold\" was also reissued for Record Store Day.\nIn June, a compilation of Prince's original recordings of songs given to other artists, entitled \"Originals\", was released - initially exclusively through TIDAL, then later on CD and vinyl. In October, a single of Prince's previously unheard original acoustic demo of \"I Feel for You\" was released digitally and as a limited 7\" single.\nIn October 2019, Prince's incomplete memoir \"The Beautiful Ones\" was published by Random House. Prince had worked on the memoir project with Dan Piepenbring during the \"Piano and a Microphone\" Tour in 2016 and had managed to complete around 50 pages before his death. The book includes those pages plus a lengthy account by Piepenbring of how the project came to be, a scrapbook of rare personal photos and miscellanea from the vault, and Prince's original handwritten concept for the film \"Purple Rain\".\nIn November, a Deluxe reissue of \"1999\" was released. This reissue had several configurations, the most expansive including 35 previously unreleased songs and two live concerts.\nSince 2020.\nIn 2020, a Super Deluxe reissue of \"Sign o' the Times\" was released. This reissue had various configurations, with the most expansive containing the original album, the single and maxi-single mixes, related B-sides, plus 45 previously unissued studio tracks, a live show from the \"Sign o' the Times Tour\" in Utrecht plus a DVD featuring the New Year's Eve 1987 show at Paisley Park. \"Pitchfork\" rated the Super Deluxe version 10 out of 10 and named it Best New Reissue.\nIn June 2021, \"The Truth\" was reissued on vinyl for Record Store Day. The following month saw the release of \"Welcome 2 America\", a completely unheard album originally recorded and shelved in 2010.\nIn 2022, \"\" was reissued on Blu-Ray, along with the soundtrack which was also released on CD and vinyl for the first time. This year also saw the release of \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\" on streaming services. It had previously been unavailable due to a plagiarism lawsuit in Italy which the estate has now resolved; Bruno Bergonzi and Michele Vicino are now legally recognized as co-writers in Italy.\nIn 2023, a Super Deluxe reissue of \"Diamonds and Pearls\" was released, containing the original album plus remixes and B-sides from this era, 33 previously unheard tracks and a Blu-ray of a live concert recorded at Glam Slam in Minneapolis as a rehearsal for the 1992 \"Diamonds and Pearls Tour\".\nAs of 2024, a nine-hour documentary on Prince was produced by Ezra Edelman for release on Netflix. The estate were reportedly unhappy with the project, considering it a \"sensationalized\" depiction of his life. A few people saw a rough cut of the film; one of them, Sasha Weiss, wrote in \"The New York Times Magazine\" that it contained at least one instance of a former girlfriend accusing him of abuse. She said \"We're asked to sit with Prince's multiplying paradoxes for many hours, allowing them to unsettle one another\". In February 2025, the project was officially cancelled and it was announced that \"a new documentary featuring exclusive content from Prince's archive\" would be produced by the estate instead; this has been described as \"a watered-down take, to placate the powers that be\". The Prince estate's social media accounts then posted a video of a vault door being opened with the caption \"The vault is free.\"\nArtistry and legacy.\nMusic and image.\nPrince is often credited as a major influence on modern popular music, and in the view of \"Billboard\" he is \"the greatest musician of his generation\". Simon Reynolds called him a \"pop polymath, flitting between funkadelia, acid rock, deep soul, schmaltz\u2014often within the same song\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" called Prince \"our first post-everything pop star, defying easy categories of race, genre and commercial appeal\". Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" described him as \"a master architect of funk, rock, R&amp;B and pop\", and highlighted his ability to defy labels.\nGeoffrey Himes described him as a leading artist in \"a tradition of left-wing black music\", or \"progressive soul\", although even he conceded the term may be \"too narrow\". \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Randall Roberts called Prince \"among the most versatile and restlessly experimental pop artists of our time,\" writing that his \"early work connected disco and synthetic funk [while his] fruitful mid-period merged rock, soul, R&amp;B and synth-pop.\" AllMusic wrote that, \"With each album he released, Prince showed remarkable stylistic growth and musical diversity, constantly experimenting with different sounds, textures, and genres [...] no other contemporary artist blended so many diverse styles into a cohesive whole.\" Jon Pareles has named Prince among the \"pantheon\" of artists in the album era, in which the album format was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption.\nAs a performer, he was known for his flamboyant style and showmanship. He came to be regarded as a sex symbol for his androgynous, amorphous sexuality, play with signifiers of gender, and defiance of racial stereotypes. His \"audacious, idiosyncratic\" fashion sense made use of \"ubiquitous purple, alluring makeup and frilled garments\". His androgynous look has been compared to those of Little Richard, Marc Bolan, and David Bowie. In 2016, Reynolds described it as \"Prince's '80s evasion of conventional gender definitions speaks to us now in this trans-aware moment. But it also harks backwards in time to the origins of rock 'n' roll in racial mixture and sexual blurring\". Prince was known for the strong female presence in his bands and his support for women in the music industry throughout his career. \"Slate\" said he worked with an \"astounding range of female stars\" and \"promised a world where men and women looked and acted like each other\". Prince also wore high-heeled shoes and boots both on and off-stage.\n\"Rolling Stone\" ranked Prince at No. 27 on its list of 100 Greatest Artists, \"the most influential artists of the rock &amp; roll era\". In 2023, the same magazine ranked him at No. 16 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. In 2010, Prince was ranked number 7 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\"'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included \"Purple Rain\" at number 72, \"Sign o' the Times\" at number 93, \"1999\" at number 163, and \"Dirty Mind\" at number 204. In 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, \"Rolling Stone\" included \"When Doves Cry\" at number 52, \"Little Red Corvette\" at number 108, \"Purple Rain\" at number 143, \"1999\" at number 212, \"Sign o' the Times\" at number 299, and \"Kiss\" at number 461.\nMany artists have cited Prince as an influence and inspiration, including Beyonc\u00e9, Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Usher, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, the Weeknd, Lady Gaga, Lorde, Marilyn Manson, Lenny Kravitz, Andr\u00e9 3000, Mark Speer, Jamie Lidell, Dua Lipa, Frank Ocean, Miguel, Mya, Robyn, D'Angelo, H.E.R., Ciara, The-Dream, St. Vincent, Ween, and Beck. Bono of U2 regarded Prince as one of his \"favorite composers of the twentieth century\". Beyonc\u00e9 expressed her admiration for Prince in the book \"Prince: A Private View\", calling him \"my mentor\" and also praising his independence: \"He dared to fight for what was rightfully his: his freedom, wrapped up in words and music he created.\"\nIn August 2017, Pantone Inc. introduced a new shade of purple (\u2003) in their color system in honor of Prince. The shade is called \"Love Symbol #2\".\nInfluences and musicianship.\nPrince's music synthesized a wide variety of influences, and drew inspiration from a range of musicians, including Ike Turner, James Brown, George Clinton, Joni Mitchell, Duke Ellington, Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Chuck Berry, David Bowie, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Mick Jagger, Rick James, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Curtis Mayfield, Elvis Presley, Todd Rundgren, Carlos Santana, Sly Stone, Jackie Wilson, and Stevie Wonder.\nPrince has been compared with jazz artist Miles Davis in regard to the artistic changes throughout his career. Davis said he regarded Prince as an otherworldly blend of James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, Marvin Gaye, Sly Stone, Little Richard, Duke Ellington, and Charlie Chaplin. Prince and Miles Davis performed together in December 1987 for a Charity Event at Paisley Park. This performance was viewed as the pinnacle of their on-again, off-again partnership.\nJournalist Nik Cohn described him as \"rock's greatest ever natural talent\". Prince had a wide vocal range from falsetto to baritone, and performed rapid, seemingly effortless shifts of register. Prince was also renowned as a multi-instrumentalist. He is considered a guitar virtuoso and a master of drums, percussion, bass, keyboards, and synthesizer. On his first five albums, he played nearly all the instruments, including 27 instruments on his debut album, among them various types of bass, keyboards and synthesizers. Prince was also quick to embrace technology in his music, making pioneering use of drum machines like the Linn LM-1 on his early '80s albums and employing a wide range of studio effects. The \"LA Times\" also noted his \"harnessing [of] new-generation synthesizer sounds in service of the groove\", laying the foundations for post-'70s funk music. Prince was also known for his prolific and virtuosic tendencies, which resulted in him recording large amounts of unreleased material.\nPrince also wrote songs for other artists, and some songs of his were covered by musicians, such as the hit songs \"Manic Monday\" (performed by the Bangles), \"I Feel for You\", originally on Prince's self-titled second album from 1979, covered by Chaka Khan, and \"Nothing Compares 2 U\", written for Prince's side project the Family, and covered very successfully by Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor. Prince co-wrote \"Love... Thy Will Be Done\" with singer Martika, for her second album, \"Martika's Kitchen\", and also gifted Celine Dion a song for her second album, \"Celine Dion\", titled \"With This Tear\"; it was a song Prince had written specifically for her. Prince also wrote \"U\" for Paula Abdul, appearing on her 1991 release \"Spellbound\".\nEquipment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Signature and custom guitars\nLegal issues.\nPseudonyms.\nIn 1993, during negotiations regarding the release of \"The Gold Experience\", a legal battle ensued between Warner Bros. and Prince over the artistic and financial control of his musical output. During the lawsuit, Prince appeared in public with the word \"slave\" written on his cheek. He explained that he had changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol to emancipate himself from his contract with Warner Bros., and that he had done it out of frustration because he felt his own name now belonged to the company.\nPrince sometimes used pseudonyms to separate himself from the music he had written, produced or recorded, and at one point stated that his ownership and achievement were strengthened by the act of giving away ideas. Pseudonyms he adopted, at various times, include: \"Jamie Starr\" and \"The Starr Company\" (for the songs he wrote for the Time and many other artists from 1981 to 1984), \"Joey Coco\" (for many unreleased Prince songs in the late 1980s, as well as songs written for Sheena Easton and Kenny Rogers), \"Alexander Nevermind\" (for writing the song \"Sugar Walls\" [1984] by Sheena Easton), and \"Christopher\" (used for his songwriting credit of \"Manic Monday\" [1986] for the Bangles).\nCopyright issues.\nOn September 14, 2007, Prince announced that he was going to sue YouTube and eBay, because they hosted his copyrighted material, and he hired the international Internet-policing company Web Sheriff. In October, Stephanie Lenz filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Publishing Group claiming that they were abusing copyright law after the music publisher had YouTube take down Lenz's home movie in which the Prince song \"Let's Go Crazy\" played faintly in the background. On November 5, several Prince fan sites formed \"Prince Fans United\" to fight back against legal requests which, they claim, Prince made to prevent all use of photographs, images, lyrics, album covers, and anything linked to his likeness. Prince's lawyers claimed that this constituted copyright infringement; Prince Fans United said that the legal actions were \"attempts to stifle all critical commentary about Prince\". Prince's promoter AEG stated that the only offending items on the three fansites were live shots from Prince's 21 nights in London at the O2 Arena earlier in the year.\nOn November 8, Prince Fans United received a song named \"PFUnk\", providing a kind of \"unofficial answer\" to their movement. The song originally debuted on the PFU main site, was retitled \"F.U.N.K.\", but this is not one of the selected songs available on the iTunes Store. On November 14, the satirical website b3ta.com pulled their \"image challenge of the week\" devoted to Prince after legal threats from the star under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\nAt the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Prince performed a cover of Radiohead's \"Creep\"; however, immediately afterward, he forced YouTube and other sites to remove footage that fans had taken of the performance despite Radiohead's request to leave it on the website. Days later, YouTube reinstated the videos, as Radiohead had said: \"It's our song, let people hear it.\" In 2009, Prince put the video of the Coachella performance on his official website.\nIn 2010, Prince declared: \"the internet is completely over\", elaborating five years later that \"the internet was over for anyone who wants to get paid... tell me a musician who's got rich off digital sales\".\nIn 2013, the Electronic Frontier Foundation granted Prince the inaugural \"Raspberry Beret Lifetime Aggrievement Award\" for what they said was abuse of the DMCA takedown process.\nIn January 2014, Prince filed a lawsuit titled \"Prince v. Chodera\" against 22 online users for direct copyright infringement, unauthorized fixation, contributory copyright infringement, and bootlegging. Several of the users were fans who had shared links to bootlegged versions of Prince concerts through social media websites like Facebook. In the same month, he dismissed the entire action without prejudice.\nPrince was one of a small handful of musicians to deny \"Weird Al\" Yankovic requests to parody his music. (Yankovic does not always need legal permission to parody songs, but he requests artists' permission as a professional courtesy.) By Yankovic's account, he'd done so \"about a half-dozen times\" and has been the sole artist not to give any explanation for his rejection beyond a flat \"no\".\nPersonal life.\nPrince had seven siblings, six of whom were half-siblings. As Prince had no will, the six siblings who survived him at the time of his death could inherit his estate. As of November 2024, only three of them, half sisters Sharon and Norraine Nelson and half brother Omar Baker, are still living. However, only the two surviving half sisters still have shares in Prince's estate.\nHis half sister Lorna died in 2006. Another half brother Alfred Jackson died in August 2019. On September 3, 2021, John R. Nelson, Prince's eldest half brother, died. On November 4, 2024, musician Tyka Nelson, who was Prince's only full sibling, died. In July 2021, Omar Bakker and late half brother Alfred Jackson's interest would sell all of the shares they owned of Prince's estate to Primary Wave Music, while Tyka Nelson would sell 90%.\nRelationships.\nPrince was romantically linked with many women over the years, including Kim Basinger, Madonna, Vanity, Jill Jones, Sheila E., Carmen Electra, Susannah Melvoin, Oph\u00e9lie Winter and Sherilyn Fenn. Susannah Melvoin recalled how, around the time of \"Sign o' the Times\", \"Wendy [Melvoin, her twin sister] and Lisa [Coleman] and I lived together and we would have [Prince] stay at our place. We became really close. He got to be in a family of three women, and we got to have our Prince. Not many people had that kind of relationship with him.\"\nIn 1990, he saw 16-year-old dancer Mayte Garc\u00eda standing outside his tour bus and referred to her as his \"future wife\" when pointing her out to bandmate Rosie Gaines. Garc\u00eda began working as one of his backup singers and dancers after graduating from high school. They were married on February 14, 1996, when he was 37 and she was 22. According to Garc\u00eda, she and Prince had a son named Amiir (born October 16, 1996), who died a week after being born due to Pfeiffer syndrome. Attempts by publications to independently verify the child's name, birth, and cause of death proved difficult due to Prince's focus on privacy. The distress of losing a child and Garc\u00eda's subsequent miscarriage took a toll on the marriage, and the couple divorced in 2000.\nPrince married Manuela Testolini, a Canadian businesswoman of Italian and Egyptian descent, in a private ceremony in 2001; she hails from Toronto, which led the couple to live there part-time. They separated in 2005 and filed for divorce in May 2006, which was finalized in October 2007.\nReligious beliefs.\nPrince was an observant religious person from childhood and throughout his life. An abiding love of God and Jesus were recurring themes in his work, often closely intertwined with romance, sexuality and sensuality on songs such as \"I Would Die 4 U\" and albums such as \"Lovesexy\". In March 2016, while discussing his childhood during a show in Oakland, he told the audience: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I wanted to be like my father and I loved everything he loved \u2014 my mother, the Bible, and music.\nA complete recitation of The Lord's Prayer featured in the full-length album version of his 1981 hit \"Controversy.\" His 1984 track \"Darling Nikki\", while dealing with explicit subject matter involving an encounter with a sex worker, contained the following backward message: \"Hello, how are you?/Fine, fine, \u2019cause I know that the Lord is coming soon/Coming, coming soon.\" That same year, he released a B-side simply entitled \"God.\"\nPrince became a Jehovah's Witness in 2001 as a result of his friendship with bassist Larry Graham. He did not consider it a conversion but a \"realization\", comparing his connection with Graham to Morpheus and Neo in the film \"The Matrix\". He attended meetings at a local Kingdom Hall and occasionally knocked on people's doors to discuss his faith. His newfound faith would also heavily influence his 2001 album \"The Rainbow Children\". The CD edition of his 2003 instrumental album \"N.E.W.S\" contained an Adobe Flash file that slowly display the words \"He Causes 2 Become\" when the disc was inserted into a computer, being a reference to the name of Jehovah in Witness theology.\nShortly after he became a Witness, former bandmates Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman reached out to him for a potential reunion of their 1980s band the Revolution. Melvoin claims he declined due to her lesbian and Jewish identities, then asked her to hold a press conference in which she would disavow homosexuality and become a Jehovah's Witness herself. She resigned herself to never hearing from him again. However, Prince later reunited with Melvoin in 2004 to perform a stripped-back acoustic version of the song \"Reflection\" on the Tavis Smiley Tonight Show and subsequently performed \"Purple Rain\" with her and Coleman at the Brit Awards 2006. Anti-gay marriage comments were attributed to him in 2008 but later denied by his management and walked back by him personally, as he later stated, \"I have friends who are gay, and we study the Bible together.\" Despite his ambiguous, contradictory and evolving personal convictions throughout his lifetime, Prince is often considered a queer icon by his fans for his influence on music, fashion and culture in a manner infused with religious themes.\nGarc\u00eda said of Prince's religious beliefs: \"He was always a spiritual seeker ... fascinated in all possibilities to integrate the signs of the zodiac and third eye and reincarnation into the Christian beliefs his Baptist mother and Seventh-day Adventist father had exposed him to.\" At the time of his death, Prince's display picture on Twitter was an illustration of him with both eyes closed and a third eye on his forehead open.\nPolitical beliefs and activism.\nPrince rarely expressed partisan political beliefs directly for the majority of his career. However, he did not shy away from political themes and commentary in early songs such as \"Partyup\", \"Ronnie Talk to Russia\" (which directly addressed then-President Ronald Reagan), \"America\", \"Sign O' the Times\" and later \"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\", in part a protest against the Gulf War. His 2002 song \"Avalanche\" contained the lyric \"Abraham Lincoln was a racist\" and discussed the Thirteenth Amendment. In 2004, the music video for his single \"Cinnamon Girl\" depicted a young Muslim woman facing Islamophobia and racial abuse and then detonating a suicide bomb in a crowded airport, before revealing it had all been a dream.\nIn a 2009 interview with Tavis Smiley, when asked for his opinion on the recent election of Barack Obama, Prince replied that he did not vote for him and has in fact never voted at all. He also expressed a belief in the chemtrail conspiracy theory during the same interview.\nTowards the end of his life, Prince was a supporter of Black Lives Matter. According to Al Sharpton, he donated to the family of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and later arranged for Eric Garner's family to attend one of his concerts. Before handing out the Grammy for Best Album in 2015, he told the audience, \"Albums \u2014 remember those? Albums still matter. Albums, like books and black lives, still matter.\u201d He organized a \"Rally 4 Peace\" concert in the city of Baltimore in the aftermath of the killing of Freddie Gray. The following day, he released a single entitled \"Baltimore\" with lyrics that mentioned Gray and Michael Brown. The music video for \"Baltimore\" featured footage of Black Lives Matter protests in the city, and closed with a message from Prince:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The system is broken. It\u2019s going to take the young people to fix it this time. We need new ideas, new life.\nAnimal rights.\nPrince was an animal rights activist who followed a vegan diet for part of his life but later described himself as vegetarian. He previously adhered to a pescetarian diet in the 2000s, and, according to an interview with the \"Vegetarian Times\", Prince first expressed curiosity in removing meat from his diet around 1987 when he ceased eating all red meat. Prince required Paisley Park guests and staff to maintain a vegetarian diet or pescetarian diet while present in order to keep the environment meatless. In honor of Prince's personal ethos, Paisley Park continues to require that individuals leave the premises if they would like to eat meat. The liner notes for his album \"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\" featured a message about the cruelty involved in wool production.\nCharitable endeavors.\nPrince did not speak publicly about his charitable endeavors. The extent of his activism, philanthropy, and charity was only publicized after his death, and much of it remains undocumented.\nIn 2001, he anonymously donated $12,000 to the Louisville Free Public Library system to keep the historic Western Branch Library (the country's first full-service library for African-Americans) from closure. That same year, he anonymously paid off the medical bills of drummer Clyde Stubblefield, who was undergoing cancer treatment.\nIn 2015, he conceived and launched YesWeCode, paying for many hackathons outright and performing musical acts at some of them. He also helped fund the Green for All initiative.\nAccording to Australian musician Ed Le Brocq's autobiography \"Danger Music\", written about Le Brocq's time as a music teacher in Afghanistan, Prince had \"quietly donated to PARSA (Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Services for Afghanistan) for years\", which had funded the revival of the Afghanistan Scout Association.\nAchievements.\nPrince sold at least 100 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2016, and Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2024. In 2016, he was posthumously honored with a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Minnesota. He was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022. Prince was named the 14th greatest guitarist of all time by \"Rolling Stone\" in 2023.\nHe has won seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the film \"Purple Rain\"), and a Golden Globe Award. Two of his albums, \"Purple Rain\" and \"Sign o' the Times\", received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year nominations. \"1999\", \"Purple Rain\" and \"Sign o' the Times\" have all been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. At the 28th Grammy Awards, Prince was awarded the President's Merit Award. Prince was also honored with the American Music Award for Achievement and American Music Award of Merit at the American Music Awards of 1990 and American Music Awards of 1995 respectively. At the 2013 \"Billboard\" Music Awards, he was honored with the \"Billboard\" Icon Award. In 2019, the 1984 film \"Purple Rain\" was added by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPrince has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis\", according to journalist Steve Marsh. The Revolution also has a star on the mural, to the immediate right of Prince's. Originally painted silver like the other stars on the mural, Prince's star was repainted in gold leaf during the night of May 4, 2016, about two weeks after Prince's death. Originally anonymous, the artist was revealed a few months later to be graphic designer and graffiti artist Peyton Russell, who had worked for Prince at his club Glam Slam in the 1990s and wanted to pay tribute.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nStudio albums\nCollaborative albums\nDemo albums\nTours.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "57321", "revid": "29269934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57321", "title": "The Police", "text": "English rock band\nThe Police were an English rock band formed in London in 1977. Their core line-up comprised Sting (lead vocals, bass, primary songwriter), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums, percussion). The Police became globally popular from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. Emerging in the British new wave scene, they played a style of rock influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz.\nTheir 1978 debut album, \"Outlandos d'Amour\", reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart and contains the singles \"Roxanne\" and \"Can't Stand Losing You\". Their second album, \"Reggatta de Blanc\" (1979), became the first of four consecutive No. 1 studio albums in the UK and Australia; its first two singles, \"Message in a Bottle\" and \"Walking on the Moon\", became their first UK number-one singles. Their next two albums, \"Zenyatta Mondatta\" (1980) and \"Ghost in the Machine\" (1981), led to further critical and commercial success, with two songs, \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" and \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\", becoming UK number-one singles and Top 5 hits in other countries. The former album was their breakthrough into the US, reaching number five on the US \"Billboard\" 200.\nTheir final studio album, \"Synchronicity\" (1983), was No. 1 in the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy and the US, selling over 8 million copies in the US. Its lead single, \"Every Breath You Take\", became their fifth UK number one, and only US number one. During this time, the band were considered one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the US: in 1983 \"Rolling Stone\" labelled them \"the first British New Wave act to break through in America on a grand scale, and possibly the biggest band in the world\". However, at the height of their fame the Police disbanded in 1984, periodically reuniting for one-off performances before fully reuniting in early 2007 for a world tour ending in August 2008. They were the world's highest-earning musicians in 2008 due to their reunion tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2007.\nThe Police have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The band won a number of music awards, including six\u00a0Grammy Awards, two\u00a0Brit\u00a0Awards (winning Best British Group once), and an MTV Video Music Award. In 2003, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of their five studio albums appeared on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The band were included among both \"Rolling Stone\"'s and VH1's lists of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".\nHistory.\n1977: formation.\nOn 25 September 1976, while on tour with the British progressive rock band Curved Air in Newcastle upon Tyne, in the northeast of England, the band's American drummer, Stewart Copeland, met and exchanged phone numbers with singer-bassist Gordon Sumner, a.k.a. Sting, who at the time was playing in a jazz-rock fusion band called Last Exit. On 12 January 1977, Sting moved to London, and on the day of his arrival, sought out Copeland for a jam session.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I was inspired by the amazing energy of the whole thing, and I thought, 'Well, I'm new to London and I'm totally unknown, so I'll give it a go.' We did a 15-minute lightning set and I squealed and screamed.\"\n\u2014Sting on his first jam session since arriving in London.\nCurved Air had recently split up and Copeland, inspired by the contemporary punk rock movement, was eager to form a new band to join the burgeoning London punk scene. While less keen, Sting acknowledged the commercial opportunities, so they formed the Police as a trio, with Corsican guitarist Henry Padovani recruited as the third member. After their debut concert on 1 March 1977 at the Alexandria Club in Newport, Wales (which lasted only ten minutes), the group played London pubs and punk clubs touring as backing band and support act for Cherry Vanilla and for Wayne County &amp; the Electric Chairs. On 1 May 1977, the Police released on Illegal Records their debut single \"Fall Out\", recorded at Pathway Studios in Islington, North London on 12 February 1977 (a couple of weeks before the band's debut live performance), with a budget of \u00a3150. This is the only Police recording featuring Padovani. Mick Jagger reviewed the single in \"Sounds\" magazine.\nAlso in May 1977, former Gong musician Mike Howlett invited Sting to join him in the band project Strontium 90. The drummer Howlett had in mind, Chris Cutler, was unavailable, so Sting took Copeland. The band's fourth member was guitarist Andy Summers. A decade older than Sting and Copeland, Summers was a music industry veteran who had played with Eric Burdon and the Animals and Kevin Ayers among others. Strontium 90 performed at a Gong reunion concert in Paris on 28 May 1977, and played at a London club (under the name of \"the Elevators\") in July. The band also recorded several demo tracks: these were released (along with live recordings and an early version of \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\") 20 years later on the archive album \"\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I thought there was fantastic potential in Sting and Stewart. I'd always wanted to play in a three-piece band. I felt that the three of us together would be very strong. They just needed another guitarist and I thought I was the one.\"\n\u2014Summers on Sting and Copeland after first hearing them at the Marquee Club in Oxford Street, London.\nSummers impressed Sting, who was becoming frustrated with Padovani's rudimentary abilities and the limitations they imposed on the Police's potential. Shortly after the Strontium 90 gig, Sting approached Summers to join the band. He agreed, on condition the band remain a trio, with him replacing Padovani. Restrained by loyalty, Copeland and Sting resisted the idea, and the Police carried on as a four-piece band. They performed live twice: on 25 July 1977 at the Music Machine in London and on 5 August at the Mont de Marsan Punk Festival. Shortly after these two gigs (and an aborted recording session with ex-Velvet Underground member John Cale as producer on 10 August), Summers delivered an ultimatum to the band and Padovani was dismissed. Copeland later said: \"One by one, Sting's songs had started coming in, and when Andy joined, it opened up new numbers of Sting's we could do, so the material started to get a lot more interesting and Sting started to take a lot more interest in the group.\"\nThe Police's power trio line-up of Copeland, Sting, and Summers performed for the first time on 18 August 1977 at Rebecca's club in Birmingham in the West Midlands. This line-up endured for the rest of the band's history. Few punk bands were three-pieces, while contemporary bands pursuing progressive rock, symphonic rock and other sound trends usually expanded their line-ups with support players. The musical background of all three players may have made them suspect to punk purists, with music critic Christopher Gable stating,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The truth is that the band merely utilized the trappings of 1970s British punk: the bleached blond short hair, Sting in his jumpsuits or army jackets, Copeland and his near maniacal drumming style. In fact, they were criticized by other punk bands for not being authentic and lacking 'street cred'. What The Police did perhaps take from punk was a brand of nervous, energetic disillusion with 1970s Britain.\nThe band also drew on influences from reggae to jazz to progressive and pub rock. While maintaining the main band, Police members continued to moonlight within the art rock scene. In late 1977 and early 1978, Sting and Summers recorded and performed as part of an ensemble led by German experimental composer Eberhard Schoener; Copeland also joined for a time. These performances resulted in three albums, a mix of rock, electronica and jazz. Various appearances by the Schoener outfit on German television made the German public aware of Sting's unusual high-pitched voice, and helped pave the way for the Police's later popularity.\nThe bleached-blond hair that became a band trademark happened by accident. In February 1978, the band, desperate for money, were asked to do a commercial for Wrigley's Spearmint chewing gum (directed by Tony Scott) on the condition they dye their hair blond in order to play a punk band (blond being associated with punk at the time). The commercial was shot with the band\u2014Summers states, \"There\u2019s a shot of us carrying a 6-foot-long packet of Wrigley\u2019s across the room\"\u2014but was never aired.\n1977\u20131978: recording contract and \"Outlandos d'Amour\".\nCopeland's older brother Miles was initially sceptical of the inclusion of Summers in the band, fearing it would undermine their punk credibility, and reluctantly agreed to provide \u00a31,500 to finance the Police's first album. \"Outlandos d'Amour\" was made with no manager or record deal. It was recorded during off-peak hours at the Surrey Sound Studios in Leatherhead, Surrey, a converted recording facility above a dairy which was run by brothers Chris and Nigel Gray.\nDuring one of his studio visits, Miles heard \"Roxanne\" for the first time at the end of a session. He had been less enthusiastic about the band's other songs, but the elder Copeland was struck by the track, and got the Police a record deal with A&amp;M Records on the strength of it. \"Roxanne\" was issued as a single in early 1978, while other album tracks were still being recorded, but failed to chart. It also failed to make the BBC's playlist, which the band attributed to the song's depiction of prostitution. A&amp;M consequently promoted the single with posters claiming \"Banned by the BBC\", though it was never banned, just not play-listed. Copeland later said, \"We got a lot of mileage out of it being supposedly banned by the BBC.\"\nThe Police made their first television appearance in October 1978, on BBC2's \"The Old Grey Whistle Test\" to promote the release of \"Outlandos d'Amour\". The BBC banned the second single from \"Outlandos d'Amour\", \"Can't Stand Losing You\" due to the single's cover, which featured Copeland hanging himself over an ice block being melted by a portable radiator. The single became the Police's first chart hit, peaking at No. 42 in the UK. The follow-up single, \"So Lonely\", issued in November 1978, failed to chart. In February 1979, \"Roxanne\" was issued as a single in North America, where it was played on radio despite the subject matter. The song peaked at No. 31 in Canada and No. 32 in the US, spurring a UK re-release of it in April. The band performed \"Roxanne\" on BBC1's \"Top of the Pops\", and the re-issue of the song peaked at No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe group's UK success led to gigs in the US at the famous New York City club CBGB, The Rathskeller in Boston and at The Chance in Poughkeepsie, New York, from which \"Roxanne\" debuted on US radio on WPDH, and a gruelling 1979 North American tour in which the band drove themselves and their equipment around the country in a Ford Econoline van. That year, \"Can't Stand Losing You\" was also re-released in the UK, peaking at No. 2. The group's first single, \"Fall Out\", was reissued in late 1979, peaking at No. 47 in the UK.\n1979: \"Reggatta de Blanc\".\nIn October 1979, the group released their second album, \"Reggatta de Blanc\", which topped the UK Albums Chart and became the first of four consecutive UK No. 1 studio albums. The album spawned the hit singles \"Message in a Bottle\" (No. 1 UK, No. 2 Canada, No. 5 Australia) and \"Walking on the Moon\" (No. 1 UK). The album's singles failed to enter the US top 40, but \"Reggatta de Blanc\" reached No. 25 on the US album charts.\nThe band's first live performance of \"Message in a Bottle\" was on the BBC's television show \"Rock Goes to College\" filmed at Hatfield Polytechnic College in Hertfordshire. The instrumental title track \"Reggatta de Blanc\" won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In February 1980, the single \"So Lonely\" was reissued in the UK, peaking at No. 6.\nIn March 1980, the Police began their first world tour, including Mexico, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Greece and Egypt. The tour was subsequently documented in the film \"The Police Around the World\" (1982), directed by Kate and Derek Burbidge, which contains footage shot by Annie Nightingale originally intended for a BBC production \"The Police in the East\".\nIn May 1980, A&amp;M in the UK released \"Six Pack\", a package containing the five A&amp;M singles (not including \"Fall Out\") in their original sleeves plus a mono alternate take of the album track \"The Bed's Too Big Without You\" backed with a live version of \"Truth Hits Everybody\". It reached No. 17 in the UK Singles Chart (although chart regulations introduced later in the decade would have classed it as an album).\n1980\u20131981: \"Zenyatta Mondatta\".\nPressured by their record company for a new record and a prompt return to touring, the Police released their third album, \"Zenyatta Mondatta\", on 3 October 1980. The album was recorded in a three-week period in the Netherlands for tax reasons and was completed the night before the band embarked on a new world tour. The album topped the UK Albums Chart and reached number five on the US \"Billboard\" 200. It also gave the group their third UK No. 1 hit single, \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" (the UK's best-selling single of 1980) and another hit single, \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\", both of which reached No. 10 in the US.\nWhile the three band members and co-producer Nigel Gray all expressed immediate regret over the rushed recording for the album, which was finished at 4 a.m. on the day the band began their world tour, the album received praise from critics. The instrumental \"Behind My Camel\", written by Andy Summers, won the band a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, while \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance for Duo or Group.\n1981\u20131982: \"Ghost in the Machine\" and \"Brimstone and Treacle\".\nThe Police's fourth album, \"Ghost in the Machine\", co-produced by Hugh Padgham, was recorded at AIR Studios on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, with the exception of \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" which was recorded at Le Studio at Morin Heights, Quebec, Canada, and released in 1981. It featured thicker sounds, layered saxophones, and vocal textures. It spawned the hit singles \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" (featuring pianist Jean Roussel), their fourth UK No. 1 (No. 3 in the US), \"Invisible Sun\", and \"Spirits in the Material World\". As the band was unable to agree on a cover picture, the album cover had three red pictographs, digital likenesses of the three band members in the style of segmented LED displays, set against a black background. In the 1980s, Sting and Summers became tax exiles and moved to Ireland (Sting to Roundstone, County Galway, and Summers to Kinsale in County Cork) while Copeland remained in England. The group opened and closed the 1981 concert film, \"Urgh! A Music War\". The film, which captured the music scene in the wake of punk, was masterminded by Stewart Copeland's brothers Ian and Miles. The film had a limited release but developed a mythic reputation over the years.\nAt the 1982 Brit Awards in London, the Police received the award for Best British Group. After the Ghost in the Machine Tour concluded in 1982, the group took a sabbatical and each member pursued outside projects. By this time, Sting was becoming a major star, and he established a career beyond the Police by branching out into acting. Back in 1979, he had made a well-received debut as the \"Ace Face\" in the British drama film \"Quadrophenia\", a film loosely based on The Who's rock opera, followed by a role as a mechanic in love with Eddie Cochran's music in Chris Petit's \"Radio On\". In 1982, Sting furthered his acting career by co-starring in the Richard Loncraine film \"Brimstone and Treacle\". He also had a minor solo hit in the United Kingdom with the movie's theme song, a cover of the 1929 hit \"Spread a Little Happiness\" (which appeared on the \"Brimstone &amp; Treacle\" soundtrack, along with three new Police tracks, \"How Stupid Mr Bates\", \"A Kind of Loving\", and \"I Burn for You\"). Over 1981 and 1982, Summers recorded his first album with Robert Fripp, \"I Advance Masked\".\nIn 1983, Stewart Copeland composed the musical score for Francis Ford Coppola's film \"Rumble Fish\". The single \"Don't Box Me In (theme From \"Rumble Fish\")\", a collaboration between Copeland and singer-songwriter Stan Ridgway (of the band Wall of Voodoo) received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. Sting filmed his first big-budget movie role in 1983, playing Feyd-Rautha in David Lynch's \"Dune\". As Sting's fame rose, his relationship with Copeland deteriorated. Their increasingly strained partnership was further stretched by the pressures of worldwide publicity and fame, conflicting egos, and their financial success. Meanwhile, both Sting's and Summers's marriages failed.\n1983: \"The Biggest Band in the World\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"MTV has paved the way for a host of invaders from abroad. In return, grateful Brits, even superstars like Pete Townshend and The Police, have mugged for MTV promo spots and made the phrase \u201dI want my MTV\u201d a household commonplace.\"\n\u2014Anglomania: The Second British Invasion, by Parke Puterbaugh for \"Rolling Stone\", November 1983.\nIn 1983, the Police released their last studio album, \"Synchronicity\", which spawned the hit singles \"Every Breath You Take\", \"Wrapped Around Your Finger\", \"King of Pain\", and \"Synchronicity II\". By that time, several critics deemed them \"the biggest rock band in the world\". Recording the album was a tense affair with increasing disputes among the band. The three members recorded their contributions individually in separate rooms and over-dubbed at different times.\nThe Synchronicity Tour began in Chicago, Illinois in July 1983 at the original Comiskey Park, and on 18 August the band played in front of 70,000 in Shea Stadium, New York. Near the end of the concert, Sting announced: \"We'd like to thank the Beatles for lending us their stadium.\" Looking back, Copeland states, \"Playing Shea Stadium was big because, even though I'm a septic tank \"(rhyming slang for 'Yank')\", The Police is an English band and I'm a Londoner \u2013 an American Londoner \u2013 so it felt like conquering America.\" They played throughout the UK in December 1983, including four sold-out nights at London's Wembley Arena, and the tour ended in Melbourne, Australia on 4 March 1984 at the Melbourne Showgrounds (the final concert featured Sunnyboys, Kids in the Kitchen, Bryan Adams and Australian Crawl, with the Police topping the bill). Sting's look, dominated by his orange hair (a result of his role in \"Dune\") and tattered clothing, both of which were emphasised in the music videos from the album, carried over into the set for the concert. Except for \"King of Pain\", the singles were accompanied by music videos directed by Godley &amp; Creme.\n\"Synchronicity\" became a No. 1 album in both the UK (where it debuted at No. 1) and the US. It stayed at No. 1 in the UK for two weeks and in the US for seventeen weeks. It was nominated for Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, but lost to Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\". \"Every Breath You Take\" won the Grammy for Song of the Year, beating Jackson's \"Billie Jean\". \"Every Breath You Take\" also won the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, while the album won the Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. \"Every Breath You Take\" also won the American Video Award for Best Group video, and the song won two Ivor Novello Awards in the categories Best Song Musically and Lyrically and Most Performed Work from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.\n1984\u20131986: hiatus, aborted sixth studio album.\nDuring the group's 1983 Shea Stadium concert, Sting felt performing at the venue was \"Everest\" and decided to pursue a solo career, according to the documentary \"The Last Play at Shea\". After the Synchronicity tour ended in March 1984, the band went on hiatus while Sting recorded and toured in support of his successful solo debut LP, the jazz-influenced \"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\", released in June 1985; Copeland recorded and filmed \"The Rhythmatist\" (1985); and Summers recorded another album with Robert Fripp (\"Bewitched\", 1984) and the theme song for the film \"\"\u2014which was not used in the film, but included on the soundtrack album. At the 1985 Brit Awards held at London's Grosvenor Hotel on 11 February, the band received the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In July, Sting and Copeland participated in Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"It was very emotional for them. I think it was clear in Sting's eyes that he was not going to be in a band anymore. They had come together for this tour and that was it.\"\n\u2014Bono, on the Police's final concert at Giants Stadium, June 1986.\nIn June 1986, the Police reconvened to play three concerts for the Amnesty International A Conspiracy of Hope tour. Their last performance on stage before their split was on 15 June at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. They ended their set with \"Invisible Sun\", bringing out Bono to sing the final verse. When they finished, they handed U2 their instruments for the all-star finale of \"I Shall Be Released\". As the lead singer of U2 \u2013 who would soon be regarded as the biggest band in the world \u2013 Bono stated, \"It was a very big moment, like passing a torch.\"\nIn July, the trio reunited in the studio to record a new album, but Copeland broke his collarbone in a fall from a horse and was unable to play the drums. As a result of the tense and short-lived reunion in the studio, \"Don't Stand So Close to Me '86\" was released in October 1986 as their final single and made it into the UK Top 25. It also appeared on the 1986 compilation ', which reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. A rerecorded version of \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\" was subsequently also included on the DTS-CD release of the ' album in 1995. The album has sold over five million copies in the US.\nFollowing the failed effort to record a new studio album, the Police effectively disbanded. In the liner notes to the Police's box set \"Message in a Box\", Summers explains: \"The attempt to record a new album was doomed from the outset. The night before we went into the studio Stewart broke his collarbone falling off a horse and that meant we lost our last chance of recovering some rapport just by jamming together. Anyway, it was clear Sting had no real intention of writing any new songs for the Police. It was an empty exercise.\"\n1986\u20132006: disbandment.\nThe band members continued with their solo careers over the next 20 years. Sting continued recording and touring as a solo performer to great success. Summers recorded several albums, both as a solo artist and in collaboration with other musicians. Copeland became a producer of movie and television soundtracks, and recorded and toured with two new bands, Animal Logic and Oysterhead. A few events brought the Police back together briefly. Summers played guitar on Sting's album \"...Nothing Like the Sun\" (1987), a favour the singer returned by playing bass on Summers's album \"Charming Snakes\" (1990) and later singing lead vocals on \"'Round Midnight\" for his tribute to Thelonious Monk \"Green Chimneys\" (1999). On 2 October 1991 (Sting's 40th birthday), Summers joined Sting on stage at the Hollywood Bowl during \"The Soul Cages\" Tour to perform \"Walking on the Moon\", \"Every Breath You Take\", and \"Message in a Bottle\". The performance was broadcast as a pay-per-view event.\nOn 22 August 1992, Sting married Trudie Styler in an 11th-century chapel in Wiltshire, southwest England. Summers and Copeland were invited to the ceremony and reception. Aware that all band members were present, the wedding guests pressured the trio into playing, and they performed \"Roxanne\" and \"Message in a Bottle\". Copeland said later that \"after about three minutes, it became 'the thing' again\". In 1995 A&amp;M released \"Live!\", a double live album produced by Summers featuring two complete concerts\u2014one recorded on 27 November 1979 at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston during the \"Reggatta de Blanc\" tour, and one recorded on 2 November 1983 at the Omni in Atlanta, Georgia, during the \"Synchronicity\" Tour (the latter was also documented in the VHS tape \"Synchronicity Concert\" in 1984).\nOn 10 March 2003, the Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and performed \"Roxanne\", \"Message in a Bottle\", and \"Every Breath You Take\" live, as a group (the last song was performed alongside Steven Tyler, Gwen Stefani, and John Mayer). In late 2003, Sting released his autobiography, \"Broken Music\".\nIn 2004, Copeland and Summers joined Incubus onstage at KROQ's Almost Acoustic Christmas concert in Los Angeles performing \"Roxanne\" and \"Message in a Bottle\". In 2004, Henry Padovani released an album with Copeland and Sting playing on one track, reuniting the original Police line-up for the first time since 1977. Also in 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the Police No. 70 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\nIn 2006, Stewart Copeland released a rockumentary about the band called \"\", based on Super-8 filming he did when the band was touring and recording in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In October 2006, Andy Summers released \"One Train Later\", an autobiographical memoir about his early career and time with the band.\n2007\u20132008: reunion tour.\nIn early 2007, reports surfaced the trio would reunite for a tour to mark the Police's 30th anniversary, more than 20 years since their split in 1986. On 22 January 2007, the punk wave magazine \"Side-Line\" broke the story the Police would reunite for the Grammys, and would perform \"Roxanne\". Side-Line also stated the Police were to embark on a massive world tour. \"Billboard\" magazine later confirmed the news, quoting Summers' 2006 statement as to how the band could have continued post-\"Synchronicity\": \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The more rational approach would have been, 'OK, Sting, go make a solo record, and let's get back together in two or three years.' I'm certain we could have done that. Of course we could have. We were definitely not in a creative dry space. We could have easily carried on, and we could probably still be there. That wasn't to be our fate. It went in another way. I regret we never paid it off with a last tour. \nThe band opened the 49th Annual Grammy Awards on 11 February 2007 in Los Angeles, announcing, \"Ladies and gentlemen, we are The Police, and we're back!\" before launching into \"Roxanne\".\nA&amp;M, the band's record company, promoted the 2007\u201308 reunion tour as the 30th anniversary of the band's formation and of the release of their first single for A&amp;M, \"Roxanne\". The Police Reunion Tour began in late May 2007 with two shows in Vancouver. Stewart Copeland gave a scathing review of the show on his own website, which the press interpreted as a feud occurring two gigs into the tour. Copeland later apologised for besmirching \"my buddy Sting,\" and chalked up the comments to \"hyper self-criticism\".\nTickets for the British leg of the tour sold out within 30 minutes, and the band played two nights at Twickenham Stadium on 8 and 9 September. On 29 and 30 September 2007, Padovani joined the group on stage for the final encore of their two shows in Paris, playing the song \"Next to You\" as a four-piece band. In October 2007, the group played the largest gig of the reunion tour in Dublin in front of 82,000 fans. The group headlined the TW Classic festival in Werchter, Belgium on 7 June 2008. They also headlined the last night of the 2008 Isle of Wight Festival on 15 June, the Heineken Jammin' Festival in Venice on 23 June and the Sunday night at Hard Rock Calling (previously called Hyde Park Calling) in London on 29 June.\nIn February 2008, the band announced that, when the tour finished, they would break up again. \"There will be no new album, no big new tour,\" said Sting. \"Once we're done with our reunion tour, that's it for The Police.\" The final show of the tour was on 7 August 2008 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The band performed the opening song, \"Message in a Bottle\", with the brass band of the New York Metropolitan Police Corp. Later, they performed \"Sunshine of Your Love\" and \"Purple Haze\" as a tribute to the rock trios that preceded them: Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience. While announcing the show, the group also donated $1 million to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's initiative to plant one million trees in the city by 2017.\nThe Police were the world's highest-earning musicians in 2008, as the tour sold 3.7 million tickets and grossed $358 million, making it the third-highest-grossing tour of all time at its conclusion. On 11 November 2008, the Police released \"\", a Blu-ray, DVD and CD set of the band's two performances in Buenos Aires, Argentina on the tour (1 and 2 December 2007). Those sets with two DVDs also included a documentary shot by Copeland's son Jordan entitled \"Better Than Therapy\" as well as photographs of Buenos Aires taken by Andy Summers.\nMusical style.\nThe Police started as a punk rock band, but soon incorporated reggae, pop and new wave elements to their sound. In his retrospective assessment, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic argues that the notion of the Police as a punk rock band was true only \"in the loosest sense of the term\". He states the band's \"nervous, reggae-injected pop/rock was punky\" and had a \"punk spirit\" but it \"wasn't necessarily punk\". A \"power trio\", the Police are also known as a new wave and post-punk band, with many songs falling in the reggae-fusion genre.\nLegacy.\nIn 2003, the Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the Police number 70 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and in 2010, they were ranked 40th on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Four of their five studio albums appeared on \"Rolling Stone\"'s 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: \"Ghost in the Machine\" (number 322), \"Reggatta de Blanc\" (number 369), \"Outlandos d'Amour\" (number 434), and \"Synchronicity\" (number 455). In 2008, \"Q\" magazine named \"Synchronicity\" among the top 10 British Albums of the 1980s.\nThe primary songwriter for the Police, Sting was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2002. In \"Rolling Stone\"'s 2004 list of the 500 greatest songs of all time, \"Every Breath You Take\" ranked number 84 (the highest new wave song on the list), and \"Roxanne\" ranked number 388. \"Message in a Bottle\" ranked number 65 in the magazine's 2008 list of the 100 greatest guitar songs. \"Q\" magazine named \"Every Breath You Take\" among the top 10 British Songs of the 1980s, and in a UK-wide poll by ITV in 2015 it was voted \"The Nation's Favourite 80s Number One\". In May 2019, \"Every Breath You Take\" was recognised by BMI as being the most performed song in their catalogue, overtaking \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" performed by the Righteous Brothers.\nWith a string of UK number one albums, the Police were among the most commercially successful British bands of the early 1980s, and with success overseas they are typically regarded as in both the vanguard of the Second British Invasion, and the new wave movement. With a history of playing to large audiences, the Police were a featured artist in the stadium rock episode of the 2007 BBC/VH1 series \"Seven Ages of Rock\" along with Queen, Led Zeppelin, U2 and Bruce Springsteen.\nDespite the band's well-documented disagreements with one another, Summers said in 2015 that Sting, Copeland and he are good friends. Summers said, \"Despite the general press thing about 'God, they hate each other', it's actually not true, we're very supportive of one another.\" While remembering his time with the Police fondly and still retaining love for his former bandmates, Copeland recalled in 2022 that working with Sting musically \"was like a Prada suit made out of barbed wire\" and that, rather than get involved in the creative infighting, Summers would enjoy \"throwing bombs\" to egg on the younger men. \"It was never an ego-clash\", Copeland said. Ruminating on the reunion shows in 2022, Sting concluded that the band had served its time: \"It was cashing that asset in, saying, Let\u2019s do it one more time and see what happens. It was hugely successful but I wouldn\u2019t do it again. That would be a bridge too far.\"\nAwards and nominations.\nGrammy Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Awards table/styles.css\" /&gt;\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / work\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n!scope=\"row\" | 1981\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan= \"2\" | 1982\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan= \"4\" | 1984\n!scope=\"row\" | 1986\nNote: \"Every Breath You Take\" won Song of the Year in 1984, but in this category the award goes to the composer(s) of the song, not to the performing artist(s).

{"id": "57322", "revid": "30585864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57322", "title": "Frederick II of Denmark", "text": "King of Denmark and Norway from 1559 to 1588\nFrederick II (; 1 July 1534\u00a0\u2013 4 April 1588) was King of Denmark and Norway and Duke of Schleswig and Holstein from 1559 until his death in 1588.\nA member of the House of Oldenburg, Frederick began his personal rule of Denmark-Norway at the age of 24. He inherited capable and strong realms, formed in large by his father after the civil war known as the Count's Feud, after which Denmark-Norway saw a period of economic recovery and of a great increase in the centralised authority of the Crown.\nFrederick was, especially in his youth and unlike his father, belligerent and adversarial, aroused by honor and national pride, and so he began his reign auspiciously with a campaign under the aged Johan Rantzau, which reconquered Dithmarschen. However, after miscalculating the cost of the Northern Seven Years' War, he pursued a more prudent foreign policy. The remainder of Frederick II's reign was a period of tranquillity, in which king and nobles prospered. Frederick spent more time hunting and feasting with his councillors, and focused on architecture and science. During his reign, many building projects were begun, including additions to the royal castles of Kronborg at Elsinore and Frederikborg Castle at Hiller\u00f8d.\nFrederick has to a great extent been overshadowed by his popular, long-reigning son Christian IV, and often been portrayed with skepticism and resentment, resulting in the prevailing portrait of Frederick as a man and as king: an unlettered, inebriated, brutish sot. This portrayal is, however, inequitable and inaccurate, and recent studies reappraise and acknowledge him as highly intelligent; he craved the company of learned men, and in the correspondence and legislation he dictated to his secretaries he showed himself to be quick-witted and articulate. Frederick was also open and loyal, and had a knack for establishing close personal bonds with fellow princes and with those who served him.\nIn 1572, Frederick married his cousin Sophie of Mecklenburg. Their relationship is regarded as one of the happiest royal marriages in Renaissance Europe. In the first ten years after the wedding, they had seven children, and are described as inseparable and harmonious.\nFrederick was committed to becoming the mightiest king in the North, and for several years he fought exhausting wars against his archrival Erik XIV of Sweden, after which the battles changed character. It became a competition to see who could trace their family history the furthest, and who could construct the most formidable castles. In the 1570s he constructed Kronborg, a large Renaissance castle that became widely recognized abroad, and its dance hall was the largest in Northern Europe at the time. He enjoyed entertaining guests and throwing elaborate festivities, which were well known throughout Europe. During the same period, the Danish-Norwegian fleet was developed into one of Europe's largest and most modern. As part of his efforts to strengthen the kingdoms, he provided much support for science and culture.\nEarly years and education.\nFrederick was born on 1 July 1534 at Haderslevhus Castle, the son of Duke Christian of Schleswig and Holstein (later King Christian III of Denmark and Norway) and Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg, the daughter of Magnus I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg. His mother was the sister of Catherine, the first wife of the Swedish king Gustav Vasa, and the mother of Eric XIV, his future rival.\nAt the time of Frederick's birth, a civil war of Denmark was coming to an end (just three days after Frederick's birth his father Christian became King of Denmark). The previous king, Frederick I, died on 10 April the year before, but the Danish Council of the Realm, which traditionally ruled the kingdom with the king, had not chosen a successor, and now Denmark had, for more than a year, functioned as an Aristocratic Republic. The father of the newborn Frederik, Christian, although eldest son of the late king, was not automatically King of Denmark, as the kingship in Denmark was not hereditary, but elective. Noblemen of the Council of the Realm could choose to pick another member of the royal family as king if they so decided.\nFrederick I and his son Christian were staunch Protestants and adherents to the Lutheran cause, however, in the Council of the Realm, which consisted of many Catholic bishops as well as a number of powerful noblemen from the old nobility, there were a majority to support the established Catholic Church. After a period of interregnum and after subsequent risings in favour of the former King Christian II, a period known as the Count's Feud, Christian III finally became victorious, and was proclaimed King of a new Protestant Denmark.\nProclaimed heir apparent.\nAfter King Christian III's victory in the Count's Feud, royal power had now returned to Denmark, and in such a way that the king could set his own terms. In his \"haandf\u00e6stning\", a document which all former Danish Kings must sign, and which regulates the relationship between king and nobility, he reduced the nobility's power, and established that the first son of the king should always be seen as heir apparent, and succeed his father automatically.\nOn 30 October 1536 Christian convened the estates of the realm (\"Rigsdag\") to Copenhagen, where they formally proclaimed Frederick heir apparent and successor to the throne, granting him the title \"Prince of Denmark\". In 1542, the Prince travelled around Denmark and was hailed by the people. In the Midsummer of 1548 Christian III and his son Frederick, in a fleet of 7 ships and together with 30 Danish nobles, sailed for Oslo, where Frederick was hailed as heir apparent to the Throne of the Kingdom of Norway. The royal reception included Danish nobles holding fiefs in Norway, received by Prince Frederik on his ship. The entire Norwegian nobility had been summoned to Oslo.\nUpbringing.\nWhile Christian III secured control of Denmark and Norway, his and Dorothea's children grew up in the bosom of the family. In addition to Anna, who was born in 1532, and Frederik from 1534, the group of siblings consisted of Magnus, born 1540, and John, who was born in 1545 and called John the Younger, to distinguish him from Christian III's half-brother, John the Elder. Youngest was a girl who was born in 1546 and named after her mother.\nIt was the usual pedagogical view of the time that parents were so inclined to spoil their own children that the upbringing of the children should be delegated to other members of the family, typically the child's maternal grandparents. But Queen Dorothea didn't want to send the children away when in infancy. Moreover, her own mother was suspected of nurturing Catholic sympathies, and in the religious era, a Lutheran Danish king could not in good conscience expose his child to Catholic influences. Another contributing factor has probably been the royal couple's concern by leaving the children too much out of sight in the tense political situation that prevailed in the first ten years of Frederik's life.\nEducation.\nFrederik's education, although profound and thorough, was focused on the ecclesiastical and Lutheran doctrine, Frederick mainly learning instructions in theology. While a princely educational program, which included learning the art of stewardship, diplomacy and war, was proposed and planned by the Danish Chancellor, it was not executed in full as the Danish Chancellor's relationship with Christian III deteriorated before the education could begin.\nLife at the court of Christian III and Dorothea was imbued with a fervent Lutheran Christianity with which all their children naturally grew up. In March 1538 Chancellor Wolfgang von Utenhof proposed an educational program for the young Prince Frederick. He was to have a Danish court steward, but he also had to work with and be inspected daily by a chamberlain, who was to be a reliable and sobering man from the Holstein nobility. The prince had to learn Latin, German, Danish, French and other languages, and when he got older he had to learn fencing and other chivalry exercises. He was to have 10\u201315 young men for company both in his studies and in his chivalrous exercises.\nTo which extent this educational program was followed is not known. In 1541, Frederick aged 7, he began his schooling. Frederick was appointed Hans Svenning, a reputed Danish humanist and professor of rhetoric at University of Copenhagen, as teacher.\nDyslexia.\nChristian III and Dorothea had probably been expecting a lot from Frederick's schooling. The son was obviously bright and had a good memory. So much bigger has the disappointment, and the amazement, been when the teaching started. Frederick learned to write beautiful and clear letters, but when it came to reading and spelling, the royal student was \"a disaster\".\nFor Hans Svaning, this deranged spelling of Frederick's could only be seen as sloppy and laziness, given that the royal boy otherwise seemed smart enough. Time and time again, Frederick has been punished, probably not only by the teacher, but also by his strict mother, who would gladly step in if Svaning's teaching was not sufficient.\nBecause of Frederick's heavy dyslexia, he was perceived by his contemporaries as unlettered and illiterate. Both Frederick's father and mother looked with skepticism at the heir to the throne, and they kept him under the watchful eye of knowledgeable men as far as possible to prevent him from publicly speaking out. Neither did his father entrust Frederik with any administrative duties.\nMalm\u00f8hus.\nIt was only at the age of 20 in 1554 that Frederik was allowed to hold his own court at Malm\u00f6 Castle in Scania, but under the supervision of the middle-aged lensman ('Fief-man') Ejler Hardenberg, who was appointed the prince's court master. At the same time, political training began, which was put in the hands of the two driven noblemen Eiler R\u00f8nnow and Erik Rosenkrantz. The years in Scania, must have felt like a liberation for Frederick. He had finally escaped from the royal court with its tightly regulated existences and pious daily lives. Just outside the moats around Malm\u00f6 Castle was the lively trading town of Malm\u00f6, which offered a young man all-out experiences.\nWhile spending many of his youth years in Scania, he became known as the \"Prince of Scania\" (\"princeps Scani\u00e6\") (). It is not known whether this title was ever officially decreed to him.\nTravels to Germany with his brother-in-law.\nThe only political education that Frederik received came from his close friendship with his brother-in-law, Elector Augustus of Saxony (reigned 1553\u201386). Some authors have later stated that Augustus was \"the only strong emotional support\" Frederick received in his youth.\nAugustus, who was the husband of Frederik's elder sister Anne, took Frederik under his wing, chaperoning him on a trip throughout the Holy Roman Empire in 1557\u201358. Here Frederik made the acquaintance of the new emperor, Ferdinand I (reigned 1558\u201364) at his coronation, his son and heir apparent Maximilian (emperor 1564\u201376), William of Orange, and a host of other more prominent German Protestant princes. The experience nurtured in Frederik a lasting appreciation of the great complexity of German politics and a taste for all things military.\nThis was most troubling to Frederick's father, the ageing Christian III, who feared that in the Empire Frederick would develop ambitions that would exceed both his abilities and the resources of his kingdoms, and that the trip would ultimately drag Denmark-Norway into the maelstrom of German princely politics.\nPeder Oxe.\nIn 1552, Steward of the Realm, Peder Oxe (1520\u20131575), had been raised to Councillor of State (\"Rigsraad\"). During the spring of 1557, Oxe and the King had quarreled over a mutual property exchange. Failing to compromise matters with the King, Oxe had fled to Germany in 1558.\nReign.\nProclaimed King.\nFrederick's father Christian III died on 1 January 1559 at Koldinghus. Frederick was not present at his father's bedside when he died, a circumstance that did not endear the new king, now King Frederick II of Denmark-Norway, to the councillors who had grown to appreciate and revere Christian.\nOn 12 August 1559 Frederick signed his haandf\u00e6stning (lit. \"Handbinding\" viz. curtailment of the monarch's power, a Danish parallel to the Magna Carta) and on 20 August 1559 Frederick II was crowned at the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen by a Danish superintendent, with Nicolaus Palladius and Jens Skielderup two Norwegian superintendent assisting, symbolizing the relationship between the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway. Week-long and elaborate celebrations are said to have taken place after the coronation.\nConquest of Ditmarschen.\nWithin weeks of Christian's death, Frederick joined with his uncles in Holstein, John and Adolf, in a military campaign to conquer the Ditmarschen, under Johan Rantzau. Frederik II's great-uncle, King John, had failed to subjugate the peasant republic in 1500, but the Frederick's 1559-campaign was a quick and relatively painless victory for the Danish Kingdom. The brevity and low cost of the campaign were cold comforts to the members of the Council of the Realm, Johan Friis in particular. Friis had warned Frederick that a very real threat of conflict with Sweden loomed just over the horizon, but the king had not listened, and had not even consulted with the Council about the Ditmarschen.\nEarly relationship with the Council of the Realm.\nThe adversarial king\u2013Council relationship improved relatively quickly however, and not because Frederik caved in to conciliar opposition. Rather, the two parties quickly learned to work together because their interests, and the Kingdom's, required that they did so. From an early time, the council invested much power in Frederick, as they had no desire to go back to the destructive near-anarchy of the pre-civil war years.\nFrederik would soon learn how to play the constitutional game that is required in a consensual monarchy, such as Denmark; namely to humour the Council without sacrificing his own royal interests. This meant showing generosity to the conciliar aristocracy through various gifts and concessions, which he did in grand style. Shortly before the signing of his coronation charter (\"haandf\u00e6stning\"), Andreas von Barby, leader of the German Chancery, died. Barby was not well liked in the Council of the Realm, but he was extreamly wealthy. The extensive fiefs in his possession reverted to the Crown, and Frederik was careful to distribute out these properties among the leading members of the Council of the Realm. Throughout his reign, Frederik would reward his conciliar aristocracy generously. Fiefs were distributed on highly favourable terms.\nThe substantially warmer relationship between king and Council of the Realm after the Ditmarschen campaign is best illustrated by the Danish central administration's performance in the greatest national crisis of the reign, the Northern Seven Years' War (1563\u201370) against Sweden.\nRelationship with Livonia.\nFrom his predecessor, Frederick inherited the Livonian War. In 1560, he installed his younger brother, Magnus of Holstein (1540\u20131583), in the Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek. King Frederick II largely tried to avoid conflict in Livonia and consolidated amicable relations with Tsar Ivan IV of Russia in the 1562 Treaty of Mozhaysk. His brother Magnus was later made titular King of Livonia, as a vassal of Tsar Ivan IV.\nNorthern Seven Years' War.\nKing Frederick's competition with Sweden for supremacy in the Baltic broke out into open warfare in 1563, the start of the Northern Seven Years' War, the dominating conflict of his rule.\nThe leading councillors, Johan Friis foremost among them, had feared a Swedish onslaught for several years, and after the succession of Frederick II's first cousin, the ambitious and unbalanced Eric XIV (reigned 1560\u20131568) to the Vasa throne a confrontation appeared inevitable. Still, few councillors wanted war, and they preferred to wait until it was forced upon them, while Frederik preferred a preemptive strike. Despite its initial opposition to the war, the Council of the Realm went along with the king. Frederik II, wisely, made no effort to exclude the council from the direction of the war, and though he retained chief operational control he entrusted much responsibility to his councillors, including Holger Ottesen Rosenkrants, Marshal Otte Krumpen, and Admiral Herluf Trolle.\nOnly one constitutional crisis emerged during the war; in late 1569, after six years of war, the Council decided not to provide the king with further grants of taxation. The war had been costly, both in lives and in gold, but since 1565 Denmark-Norway had made no appreciable gains. The council had already asked Frederik to make peace, and he had made a half-hearted attempt to do so in 1568, but neither Frederik nor his Swedish opponent was willing to concede defeat.\nThe war developed into an extremely expensive war of attrition in which the areas of Scania were ravaged by the Swedes, and Norway was almost lost. During this war, King Frederick II led his army personally on the battlefield, but although with some small success, overall without much result.\nThe council, in cutting off financial support, had hoped to coerce the king into ending the war. Frederik felt betrayed, and after some reflection, Frederick felt that the only honourable recourse was abdication. With his letter of resignation in the hands of the councillors, he left the capital to go hunting in the countryside. The king, still unmarried, had no heir, and consequently the Council of the Realm had good reason to fear another leaderless interregnum and even another civil war. It played into the king's hands; the Council begging for his return to the throne and allowed him to summon a Diet to consider additional tax levies.\nThe conflict damaged his relationship with his noble councillors; however, the later Sture murders of 24 May 1567 by the insane King Eric XIV in Sweden, eventually helped stabilize the situation in Denmark-Norway. After King John III of Sweden, King Eric's successor, refused to accept a peace favoring Denmark-Norway in the Treaties of Roskilde (1568), the ongoing war dragged on until it was ended by a status quo peace in the Treaty of Stettin (1570), that let Denmark-Norway save face but also show limits of Danish and Norwegian military power.\nFrederik II learned a great deal about kingship during the war with Sweden. He learned to include the Council of the Realm in most matters of policy, but he also learned that it was possible to manipulate the council, even to bend it to his own will, without humiliating it or undermining its authority. He would later come to master this ability and use it extensively.\nLater reign.\nDuring the eighteen remaining years of his reign, Frederik would come to drew extensively on the lessons he learned in the Northern Seven Years' War with Eric XIV of Sweden. In the peacetime years, he maintained a rather peripatetic court, moving from residence to residence throughout the Danish countryside, spending a fair share of his time in hunting. This allowed him the opportunity to meet members of the Council individually and informally, in their home regions. As was required of the Danish King, he did summon the Council of the Realm once annually to meet at the \"herredag\", but most of his business with the council was done on a one-to-one basis. This ensured a very close personal bond with each member of the council while minimizing the opportunity for the council to oppose him as a full body. Frederik's personable disposition also helped, and so, too, did the informal nature of court life under Frederik II. The king hunted, feasted, and drank with his noble councillors and advisers, and even with visiting foreign dignitaries, treating them as his equal peers and companions rather than as political opponents or inferiors. The eighteenth-century chronicler Ludvig Holberg claimed that when dining at his court, Frederik would frequently announce that 'the king is not at home', which signalled to his guests that all court formalities were temporarily suspended, and that they could talk and joke as they pleased without restraint. The Danish court of Frederick II may have appeared to be unsophisticated to outside observers, but the openness and bawdiness of court life served Frederik's political purposes. In 1585, he visited Norway for the first and only time as king, but only went to Bohuslen.\nFinancial situation.\nThe great cost of the Northern Seven Years' War, some 1.1\u00a0million rigsdaler, was recovered chiefly from higher taxation on both Danish and Norwegian farm properties. After state finances collapsed in the aftermath of the war, King Frederick II called Peder Oxe home to address the kingdom's economy. The taking over of Danish administration and finances by the able councillor, provided a marked improvement for the national treasury. Councillors of experience, including Niels Kaas, Arild Huitfeldt, and Christoffer Valkendorff, took care of the domestic administration. Subsequently, government finances were put in order and Denmark-Norway's economy improved. One of the chief expedients of the improved state of affairs was the raising of the Sound Dues. Oxe, as lord treasurer, reduced the national debt considerably and redeemed portions of crown lands.\nConstructions in reign.\nAfter the Northern Seven Years' War a period of affluence and growth followed in Danish-Norwegian history. The greater financial liquidity of the crown and the king's decreased dependence on the Council for funding, while not meaning that Frederick was actively seeking to sidestep conciliar control, it did allow him to be less frugal than his late father, Christian III, had been. Considerable funds were devoted to an expansion of the Danish-Norwegian fleet and of the facilities for its support, not merely for security purposes but also to aid Frederick's active endeavours to rid the Baltic Sea of pirates. The increased revenues likewise enabled Frederik to undertake the construction of Denmark's first national road network, the so-called \"kongevej\" ('King's Road'), connecting the larger towns and the royal residences.\nThe most visible area of expenditure, however, was the royal castles and the court itself. Frederick spent freely on the reconstruction of several royal residences and other cities:\nFor all Frederick's egalitarian behaviour at his court, Frederick was acutely aware of his elevated status. Like most monarchs of his day, he sought to bolster his international reputation through a measure of ostentatious display, in his patronage of artists and musicians, as well as in the elaborate ceremonies staged for royal weddings and other public celebrations.\nKronborg and \"The King's Sound\".\nFrederick II had claimed naval supremacy in 'the king's sound', as he called The Sound and, indeed, the whole expanse of waters lying between his Norwegian and Icelandic possessions. In 1583 he secured an agreement by which England made an annual payment for permission to sail there, and France later followed suit.\nHe also tried to bring the Icelandic trade and fisheries into the hands of his own subjects instead of Englishmen and Germans and encouraged adventurers such as Magnus Heinason, to whom he gave a monopoly of trade with the Faeroes, a half-share in ships captured on unlawful passage to the White Sea, and backing for a bold but unsuccessful attempt to reach east Greenland.\nRelationship with the Church.\nThe necessity of maintaining order within the church meant that royal interference into ecclesiastical affairs was unavoidable. There was no longer an archbishop within the hierarchy, so the king was the final authority in matters that could not be settled by the bishops alone. As his father, Christian III, put it, kings were the 'father to the superintendents'.\nAs protector of the church and therefore of the clergy, Frederick frequently intervened in disputes between clergy and laity, even when the issues involved were trivial ones.\nFrederik II repeatedly came to the defence of new parish priests whose congregations tried to force them to marry their predecessors' widows, and sometimes to protect preachers from the wrath of overbearing noblemen. Conversely, the king \u2013 and especially Frederik II \u2013 would see to it personally that unruly, incompetent, or disreputable priests lost their parishes, or he would pardon those who had been punished by their superintendents for minor infractions. Protecting and disciplining the clergy was, after all, part of the king's obligation to the state church.\nFrederik II was more active than his late father in extending his royal authority into areas that the 1537 Ordinance had protected from secular power. Frederik consulted with members of the theological faculty at the University of Copenhagen\u2014the so-called 'most learned ones' (\"h\u00f8jl\u00e6rde\")\u2014but he did not shy away from making changes in the most minute liturgical matters. He stipulated the books that every parish priest should have in his library, set standardized times for worship services in the towns, and set minimal standards of competence for all preachers.\nAlthough Frederick interfered much in ecclesiastical affairs, Paul Douglas Lockhart pointed out, that Frederick \"was not interested in dictating conscience\", stating that \"he wanted only to prevent useless religious disputes, disputes that could weaken the kingdom and leave it vulnerable to Catholic aggression\".\nBook of Concord.\nA good testimony of Frederik's stubborn resistance to all religious controversy can be found in his response to the late sixteenth-century Lutheran statement of faith, the Formula and Book of Concord. The 'Concord', which was written by leading Saxon divines and sponsored by Frederik II's brother-in-law, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, was an attempt to promote unity among the German Lutheran princes. As a unifier, however, the Concord was an abject failure.\nAugust had recently purged his court of Calvinists and Philippists, and orthodox Lutherans like Jacob Andreae composed the document. The Concord was extremely orthodox. Frederik II had already clashed with his old friend and companion Augustus over theological issues: in 1575, Augustus had complained profoundly about the Calvinist sentiments expounded by Niels Hemmingsen in the treatise \"Syntagma institutionum christianarum\" (1574). Though Frederik tried to defend Hemmingsen, who was his favourite divine, he also wanted to keep Augustus' friendship, and he therefore dismissed Hemmingsen \u2013 with honour \u2013 from his post at the University of Copenhagen in 1579. Frederik was not nearly so receptive to August's promotion of the Concord.\nLike many other contemporaries of his time, Frederick believed that the Book of Concord promoted discord, and not harmony. Ignoring Augustus's warnings that a Calvinist plot had taken root in Denmark's clergy, he banned the Concord from his lands in July 1580. Possession of the book, or even discussion of its contents, would be punished severely. The king burned his own personal copies, which were sent to him by his sister Anne, wife of Augustus. The Concord, he argued, contained \"teachings which are foreign and alien to us and to our churches, [and which] could easily disrupt the unity which ... these kingdoms have hitherto maintained\".\nMarriage Ordinance.\nFrederik II's 'Marriage Ordinance' of 1582, inspired by Niels Hemmingsen's writings on the institution, allowed divorce for a wide range of reasons, including infidelity, impotence, leprosy, venereal disease, and outlawry.\nAreas of interest.\nUniversity of Copenhagen.\nFrederick was a great patron of the University of Copenhagen, where he introduced educational reforms in the 1570s and 1580s. Frederik increased the university's budget almost exponentially, expanding the size of its teaching staff and providing substantially higher salaries. While demanding higher educational standards from the priesthood, Frederick and his advisers provided more support for impoverished students. One hundred students, selected by the faculty, received room and board free of fee from the crown, each for a period of five years. Four especially promising students would be awarded the \"stipendium regium\", which paid all costs for study abroad so long as the recipient returned to Copenhagen to finish his doctorate.\nMedicine.\nThe interests of Frederik II and his intellectual circle of wise men were more wide-ranging than that of his father's theological one. Frederik had a strong proclivity for Paracelsian medicine: in 1571 he appointed Johannes Pratensis to the medical faculty of the University of Copenhagen, and in the same year Petrus Severinus became his personal physician. Severinus wielded considerable influence among Paracelsian practitioners, following the publication of his Idea \"medicin\u00e6 philosophic\u00e6\" (1571).\nAlchemy, astrology and Tycho Brahe.\nFrederik II's fascination with alchemy and astrology, common to contemporary sovereigns, sped the rise of the astronomer Tycho Brahe to international renown as a pioneer in Europe's Scientific Revolution. Tycho Brahe came from the highest ranks of the Danish ruling elite: his father, Otte Brahe til Knudstrup, was a fiefholder in Scania and a member of the Council of the Realm, as was Tycho\u2019s brother Axel Brahe.\nAfter an extensive education abroad, Tycho Brahe returned to Denmark not to pursue a career in state service as men of his blood typically did, but instead retreated to the monastery at Herrevad, where he and his maternal uncle Sten Bille experimented with the manufacture of paper and glass and maintained a private observatory. Brahe's treatise on the supernova that appeared in Cassiopeia in November 1572, published at the behest of the rigshofmester Peder Oxe, brought his activities to the attention of Frederik and his court. At the king's insistence, Brahe took up a lectureship at the University of Copenhagen in 1574, and two years later he was granted the island of Ven as his fief. As a fiefholder, he turned out to be a minor disaster, but the observatory at his residence, Uraniborg, drew students from all over Europe. From 1576 until his expulsion by Christian IV in 1597, Brahe supervised the first publicly funded scientific research institute in European history.\nCharacter as patron of science.\nIn his later life, Frederik was fiscally cautious in all matters of state, but he gave an abundance of royal support when it was directed towards the life of the mind. Even after he dismissed Hemmingsen from the University of Copenhagen in 1579, for example, he made sure that the theologian still had a gracious salary and the opportunity to study. Tycho Brahe received not only Ven as a 'free fief', but also several other fiefs, canonries, and farms in Scania to fund his work at Uraniborg.\nFrederik himself picked out the island of Ven as a place where Brahe could conduct his experiments without distraction. Perhaps the king was driven, in part, by a desire to enhance Denmark's reputation among the great nations of Europe, but even so he demonstrated a finely tuned appreciation for intellectual talent.\nAs Frederick is alleged to have said to Brahe:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I will sail over to the island [Hven] from time to time and see your work in astronomy and chemistry, and gladly support your investigations, not because I have any understanding of astronomical matters ... but because I am your king and you my subject ... . I see it as my duty to support and promote something like this\u2014\u200a\nHunting, drinking and feasting.\nFrederick's areas of interest did not consist only of theological and scientific ones. Frederick is known very well for his love of hunting, drinking and feasting. In his youth and in the start of his reign this was a way for Frederick to get away from the Danish court and its formalities. However, in Frederick's later reign he began using hunting and feasting as a political tool. In the peacetime years of his reign, Frederick would maintain a peripatetic court, moving from residence to residence throughout the Danish countryside, spending a fair share of his time hunting. This allowed him the opportunity to meet members of the Council individually and informally, in their own home regions. Most of his business with the Council of the Realm was therefor done on a one-to-one basis. This ensured a very close personal bond with each member of the council while minimizing the opportunity for the council to oppose him as a body. Frederik's personable disposition undoubtedly helped.\nInformal nature of court life.\nThe king hunted, feasted, and drank with his councillors and advisers, and even with visiting European foreign dignitaries, treating them as his peers and companions rather than as political opponents or inferiors. The eighteenth-century chronicler Ludvig Holberg claimed that when dining at the court of Frederick II, he would frequently announce that 'the king is not at home', which signalled to his guests that all court formalities were temporarily suspended, and that they could talk and joke as they pleased without restraint. The Danish court may have appeared unsophisticated to outside observers, but the openness and bawdiness of court life served Frederik's political purposes.\nYouth and marriage.\nAnne Hardenberg.\nAs a young man, Frederick II had desired to marry the noblewoman, Anne Hardenberg, who had served as a lady-in-waiting to his mother, the Dowager Queen Dorothea of Denmark, however as she was not of princely birth, this was impossible. There is no evidence that either of them had any interest in entering a morganatic marriage and Anne Hardenberg was married six months after Frederick, after which there is no known contact between them.\nPossible matrimonies.\nNegotiations to find a suitable royal bride were manifold during the 1560s, but mostly it came to nothing, often because Frederick strongly insisted on meeting the prospective bride before committing to her. The proposed matrimonies included:\nMarriage to Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow.\nOn 20 July 1572, he was married to Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow, a descendant of King John of Denmark, and also his own first half-cousin, through their grandfather, Frederick I, King of Denmark and Norway.\nSophie was the daughter of Ulrich III, Duke of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow and Elizabeth of Denmark. Their marriage was harmonious and happy. Sophie is consistently mentioned in Frederick's handwritten diary as \"mynt Soffye\", meaning \"my Sophie\" and she followed him through the country as the court was very mobile. Queen Sophie was a loving mother, nursing her children personally during their illnesses. When Frederick was sick with malaria in 1575, she personally nursed him and wrote many worried letters to her father about his progress.\nAfter Frederick's death Sophie was granted a life estate or 'Dowager-pension' (), consisting of Nyk\u00f8bing Castle and the islands of Lolland and Falster. The Dowager Queen Sophie managed her estates in Lolland-Falster so well that her son could borrow money from her on several occasions for his wars.\nIssue.\nFrederick and Sophie had seven children:\nDeath and burial.\nKing Frederick II died on 4 April 1588, aged 53, at Antvorskov.\nFrederick was buried on 5 August 1588 in Christian I's chapel at Roskilde Cathedral, where his son King Christian IV later built a large monument in honour of his late father.\nLegacy.\nMany recent historians, such as Poul Grinder-Hansen, Paul Douglas Lockhart, Thomas Kingston Derry and Frede P. Jensen have expressed, that it is difficult to see how the reign, and especially the later reign, of Frederik II could be viewed as anything other than a resounding success. Frederick's character have throughout time been misinterpreted by Danish historians as unlettered, foolish and stupid; leaving state affairs to his councillors to go hunting in the countryside.\nHowever, this is incorrect, and Frederick was highly intelligent. He craved the company of learned men, who composed his inner circle of intellectuals, and they had many interests, including medicine, alchemy, astrology and theology. As Paul Douglas Lockhart later stated: \"Frederik II may have been a near illiterate (...) but nonetheless he was enlightened as few monarchs of his generation were. It is difficult to see how Danish historians for so long laboured under the impression that he was little better than a drunken fool\".\nClassical and more recent portrayal.\nThe negative portrayal of Frederik II was founded by the cultural historian Troels Frederik Lund in his 1906 biography of Peder Oxe, who in his opinion saved Denmark on the brink of abyss against the foolhardy young king and his German war-mad officers. This portrayal was continued by Erik Arup, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He (Frederick II) was robust and brutal, so hotheaded and gross in his whole way that it was striking even for his contemporaries. His penchant for overestimating himself and underestimating everyone else was a profound feature of him that made him highly ungracious and unlovable\u2014\u200a\nOften described as wilful and impatient, he was easily moved to anger, and by his early twenties had exhibited a weakness for strong drink and an addiction to the hunt. These are the traits upon which Danish historians have most often focused, resulting in the prevailing portrait of Frederik as a man and as king: an unlettered, inebriated, brutish sot, who virtually abdicated his responsibilities of king in favour of hunting and binge drinking.\nThis portrayal is, however, unfair and inaccurate, and thanks to the research of Frede P. Jensen it has been redrawn. Frede P. Jensen (1940\u20132008), after thorough archival studies, was one of the first historians in Denmark who, in his works, radically changed the view of the King Frederick II.\nFrederik was indeed no great scholar, owing largely to the fact that he was very dyslexic. Throughout his entire life he would struggle with his difficulty in reading and writing, and it embarrassed him immensely. But he was, as those close to him would attest, highly intelligent; he craved the company of learned men, and in the correspondence and legislation he dictated to his secretaries he showed himself to be quick-witted and articulate. Frederik was also open and loyal, and had a knack for establishing close personal bonds with fellow princes and with those who served him. These qualities would make him an ideal politician. Indeed, Frederik would take the chief legacy of his father's kingship \u2013 the close symbiosis between king and aristocracy \u2013 to its logical limits, and simultaneously would bring Denmark to the height of its power and influence in European affairs.\nThe rebirth of the University of Copenhagen and the professionalization of the central administration, coupled with the prominence of learned men within the king's inner circle, gave the court of Frederik II a uniquely refined and scholarly character that was lacking in his father's court. This, in turn, gave rise to increased intellectual activity throughout the realm. Literature, mostly theological, blossomed in the second half of the century.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are found throughout the temperate regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, with the greatest diversity in the eastern part of the Mediterranean region.\nThe palmately cleft leaves are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple, or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. Propagation is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring.\nGeraniums are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, ghost moth, and mouse moth. At least several species of \"Geranium\" are gynodioecious. The species \"Geranium viscosissimum\" (sticky geranium) is considered to be protocarnivorous.\nName.\nThe genus name is derived from Ancient Greek (\"g\u00e9ranos\") 'crane'. The English name 'cranesbill' derives from the resemblance of the fruit capsule of some of the species to a crane's head and bill. The ovary portion forms the head and the prolonged stigma creates the appearance of a beak.\nDescription.\nThe flowers are typically five-petaled and white to purple. The leaves are palmate divided into narrow, pointed segments.\nThe fruit capsule consists of five cells joined to a column produced from the centre of the flower. The cells form lobes which eventually separate, each containing one seed. When the fruit is ripe, the beak-like stigma springs open and casts the ovoid, streamlined seeds some distance, dispersing the seeds.\nConfusion with \"Pelargonium\".\nConfusingly, \"geranium\" is also the common name of members of the genus \"Pelargonium\", which are also in the family Geraniaceae and are widely grown as horticultural bedding plants. Linnaeus originally included all the species in one genus, \"Geranium\", but they were later separated into two genera by Charles L\u2019H\u00e9ritier in 1789. Other former members of the genus are now classified in \"Erodium\", including the plants known as filarees in North America.\nThe term \"hardy geranium\" is often applied to horticultural \"Geranium\"s to distinguish them from the \"Pelargonium\"s, which are not winter-hardy in temperate horticulture. However, not all \"Geranium\" species are winter-hardy (see below).\nThe shape of the flowers offers one way of distinguishing between the two genera \"Geranium\" and \"Pelargonium\". \"Geranium\" flowers have five very similar petals, and are thus radially symmetrical (actinomorphic), whereas \"Pelargonium\" (and also \"Erodium\") flowers have two upper petals which are different from the three lower petals, so the flowers have a single plane of symmetry (zygomorphic).\nCultivation.\nA number of geranium species are cultivated for horticultural use and for pharmaceutical products. Some of the more commonly grown species include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAll the above species are perennials and generally winter-hardy plants, grown for their attractive flowers and foliage. They are long-lived and most have a mounding habit, with palmately lobed foliage. Some species have spreading rhizomes. They are normally grown in part shade to full sun, in well-draining but moisture retentive soils, rich in humus. Other perennial species grown for their flowers and foliage include: \"Geranium argenteum\", \"G.\u00a0eriostemon\", \"G.\u00a0farreri\", \"G.\u00a0nodosum\", \"G.\u00a0procurrens\", \"G.\u00a0pylzowianum\", \"G.\u00a0renardii\", \"G.\u00a0traversii\", \"G.\u00a0tuberosum\", \"G.\u00a0versicolor\", \"G.\u00a0wallichianum\", and \"G.\u00a0wlassovianum\". Some of these are not winter-hardy in cold areas and are grown in specialized gardens like rock gardens. \"Geranium\" 'Johnson's Blue' is a hybrid between \"G. himalayense\" (southwestern China), with \"G.\u00a0pratense\" (European meadow cranesbill).\nCultivars.\nThe following hybrid cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (other cultivars are dealt with under their species name - see above):- \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The formula is named after Abraham de Moivre, although he never stated it in his works. The expression cos \"x\" + \"i\" sin \"x\" is sometimes abbreviated to cis \"x\".\nThe formula is important because it connects complex numbers and trigonometry. By expanding the left hand side and then comparing the real and imaginary parts under the assumption that x is real, it is possible to derive useful expressions for cos \"nx\" and sin \"nx\" in terms of cos \"x\" and sin \"x\".\nAs written, the formula is not valid for non-integer powers n. However, there are generalizations of this formula valid for other exponents. These can be used to give explicit expressions for the nth roots of unity, that is, complex numbers z such that \"zn\" \n 1.\nUsing the standard extensions of the sine and cosine functions to complex numbers, the formula is valid even when x is an arbitrary complex number.\nExample.\nFor formula_2 and formula_3, de Moivre's formula asserts that\nformula_4\nor equivalently that\nformula_5\nIn this example, it is easy to check the validity of the equation by multiplying out the left side.\nRelation to Euler's formula.\nDe Moivre's formula is a precursor to Euler's formula\nformula_6\nwith x expressed in radians rather than degrees, which establishes the fundamental relationship between the trigonometric functions and the complex exponential function. \nOne can derive de Moivre's formula using Euler's formula and the exponential law for integer powers\nformula_7\nsince Euler's formula implies that the left side is equal to formula_8 while the right side is equal to formula_9\nProof by induction.\nThe truth of de Moivre's theorem can be established by using mathematical induction for natural numbers, and extended to all integers from there. For an integer n, call the following statement S(\"n\"):\nformula_10\nFor \"n\" &gt; 0, we proceed by mathematical induction. S(1) is clearly true. For our hypothesis, we assume S(\"k\") is true for some natural k. That is, we assume\nformula_11\nNow, considering S(\"k\" + 1):\nformula_12\nSee angle sum and difference identities.\nWe deduce that S(\"k\") implies S(\"k\" + 1). By the principle of mathematical induction it follows that the result is true for all natural numbers. Now, S(0) is clearly true since cos(0\"x\") + \"i\" sin(0\"x\") \n 1 + 0\"i\" \n 1. Finally, for the negative integer cases, we consider an exponent of \u2212\"n\" for natural n.\nformula_13\nThe equation (*) is a result of the identity\nformula_14\nfor \"z\" \n cos \"nx\" + \"i\" sin \"nx\". Hence, S(\"n\") holds for all integers n.\nFormulae for cosine and sine individually.\nFor an equality of complex numbers, one necessarily has equality both of the real parts and of the imaginary parts of both members of the equation. If x, and therefore also cos \"x\" and sin \"x\", are real numbers, then the identity of these parts can be written using binomial coefficients. This formula was given by 16th century French mathematician Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te:\nformula_15\nIn each of these two equations, the final trigonometric function equals one or minus one or zero, thus removing half the entries in each of the sums. These equations are in fact valid even for complex values of x, because both sides are entire (that is, holomorphic on the whole complex plane) functions of x, and two such functions that coincide on the real axis necessarily coincide everywhere. Here are the concrete instances of these equations for \"n\" \n 2 and \"n\" \n 3:\nformula_16\nThe right-hand side of the formula for cos \"nx\" is in fact the value \"T\"\"n\"(cos \"x\") of the Chebyshev polynomial \"T\"\"n\" at cos \"x\".\nFailure for non-integer powers, and generalization.\nDe Moivre's formula does not hold for non-integer powers. The derivation of de Moivre's formula above involves a complex number raised to the integer power n. If a complex number is raised to a non-integer power, the result is multiple-valued (see failure of power and logarithm identities).\nRoots of complex numbers.\nA modest extension of the version of de Moivre's formula given in this article can be used to find the n-th roots of a complex number for a non-zero integer n. If z is a complex number, written in polar form as\nformula_17\nthen the n-th roots of z are given by\nformula_18\nwhere k varies over the integer values from 0 to .\nThis formula is also sometimes known as de Moivre's formula.\nComplex numbers raised to an arbitrary power.\nGenerally, if formula_19 (in polar form) and w are arbitrary complex numbers, then the set of possible values is\nformula_20\n(Note that if w is a rational number that equals \"p\" / \"q\" in lowest terms then this set will have exactly q distinct values rather than infinitely many. In particular, if w is an integer then the set will have exactly one value, as previously discussed.) In contrast, de Moivre's formula gives\nformula_21\nwhich is just the single value from this set corresponding to \"k\" = 0.\nAnalogues in other settings.\nHyperbolic trigonometry.\nSince cosh \"x\" + sinh \"x\" \n \"ex\", an analog to de Moivre's formula also applies to the hyperbolic trigonometry. For all integers n,\n formula_22\nIf n is a rational number (but not necessarily an integer), then cosh \"nx\" + sinh \"nx\" will be one of the values of (cosh \"x\" + sinh \"x\")\"n\".\nExtension to complex numbers.\nFor any integer n, the formula holds for any complex number formula_23\nformula_24\nwhere\n formula_25\nQuaternions.\nTo find the roots of a quaternion there is an analogous form of de Moivre's formula.

Among his fellow Huguenot exiles in England, he was a colleague of the editor and translator Pierre des Maizeaux.\nDe Moivre wrote a book on probability theory, \"The Doctrine of Chances\", said to have been prized by gamblers. De Moivre first discovered Binet's formula, the closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers linking the \"n\"th power of the golden ratio \"\u03c6\" to the \"n\"th Fibonacci number. He also was the first to postulate the central limit theorem, a cornerstone of probability theory, of which he proved a special case.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nAbraham de Moivre was born in Vitry-le-Fran\u00e7ois in Champagne on 26 May 1667. His father, Daniel de Moivre, was a surgeon who believed in the value of education. Though Abraham de Moivre's parents were Protestant, he first attended the Christian Brothers' Catholic school in Vitry, which was unusually tolerant given religious tensions in France at the time. When he was eleven, his parents sent him to the Protestant Academy at Sedan, where he spent four years studying Greek under Jacques du Rondel. The Protestant Academy of Sedan had been founded in 1579 at the initiative of Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon, the widow of Henri-Robert de la Marck.\nIn 1682 the Protestant Academy at Sedan was suppressed, and de Moivre enrolled to study logic at Saumur for two years. Although mathematics was not part of his course work, de Moivre read several works on mathematics on his own, including \"\u00c9l\u00e9ments des math\u00e9matiques\" by the French Oratorian priest and mathematician Jean Prestet and a short treatise on games of chance, \"De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae\", by Christiaan Huygens the Dutch physicist, mathematician, astronomer and inventor. In 1684, de Moivre moved to Paris to study physics, and for the first time had formal mathematics training with private lessons from Jacques Ozanam.\nReligious persecution in France became severe when King Louis XIV issued the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, which revoked the Edict of Nantes, that had given substantial rights to French Protestants. It forbade Protestant worship and required that all children be baptised by Catholic priests. De Moivre was sent to Prieur\u00e9 Saint-Martin-des-Champs, a school to which the authorities sent Protestant children for indoctrination into Catholicism.\nIt is unclear when de Moivre left the Prieur\u00e9 de Saint-Martin and moved to England, since the records of the Prieur\u00e9 de Saint-Martin indicate that he left the school in 1688, but de Moivre and his brother presented themselves as Huguenots admitted to the Savoy Church in London on 28 August 1687.\nMiddle years.\nBy the time he arrived in London, de Moivre was a competent mathematician with a good knowledge of many of the standard texts. To make a living, de Moivre became a private tutor of mathematics, visiting his pupils or teaching in the coffee houses of London. De Moivre continued his studies of mathematics after visiting the Earl of Devonshire and seeing Newton's recent book, \"Principia Mathematica\". Looking through the book, he realised that it was far deeper than the books that he had studied previously, and he became determined to read and understand it. However, as he was required to take extended walks around London to travel between his students, de Moivre had little time for study, so he tore pages from the book and carried them around in his pocket to read between lessons.\nAccording to a possibly apocryphal story, Newton, in the later years of his life, used to refer people posing mathematical questions to him to de Moivre, saying, \"He knows all these things better than I do.\"\nBy 1692, de Moivre became friends with Edmond Halley and soon after with Isaac Newton himself. In 1695, Halley communicated de Moivre's first mathematics paper, which arose from his study of fluxions in the \"Principia Mathematica\", to the Royal Society. This paper was published in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" that same year. Shortly after publishing this paper, de Moivre also generalised Newton's noteworthy binomial theorem into the multinomial theorem. The Royal Society became apprised of this method in 1697, and it elected de Moivre a Fellow on 30 November 1697.\nAfter de Moivre had been accepted, Halley encouraged him to turn his attention to astronomy. In 1705, de Moivre discovered, intuitively, that \"the centripetal force of any planet is directly related to its distance from the centre of the forces and reciprocally related to the product of the diameter of the evolute and the cube of the perpendicular on the tangent.\" In other words, if a planet, M, follows an elliptical orbit around a focus F and has a point P where PM is tangent to the curve and FPM is a right angle so that FP is the perpendicular to the tangent, then the centripetal force at point P is proportional to FM/(R*(FP)3) where R is the radius of the curvature at M. The Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli proved this formula in 1710.\nDespite these successes, de Moivre was unable to obtain an appointment to a chair of mathematics at any university, which would have released him from his dependence on time-consuming tutoring that burdened him more than it did most other mathematicians of the time. At least a part of the reason was a bias against his French origins.\nIn November 1697 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1712 was appointed to a commission set up by the society, alongside MM. Arbuthnot, Hill, Halley, Jones, Machin, Burnet, Robarts, Bonet, Aston, and Taylor to review the claims of Newton and Leibniz as to who discovered calculus. The full details of the controversy can be found in the Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy article.\nThroughout his life de Moivre remained poor. It is reported that he was a regular customer of old Slaughter's Coffee House, St. Martin's Lane at Cranbourn Street, where he earned a little money from playing chess.\nLater years.\nDe Moivre continued studying the fields of probability and mathematics until his death in 1754. Several additional papers were published after his death. As he grew older, he became increasingly lethargic and needed longer sleeping hours. It is a common claim that De Moivre noted he was sleeping an extra 15 minutes each night and correctly calculated the date of his death as the day when the sleep time reached 24 hours, 27 November 1754. On that day he did in fact die, in London and his body was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, although his body was later moved. The claim of him predicting his own death, however, has been disputed as not having been documented anywhere at the time of its occurrence.\nProbability.\nDe Moivre pioneered the development of analytic geometry and the theory of probability by expanding upon the work of his predecessors, particularly Christiaan Huygens and several members of the Bernoulli family. He also produced the second textbook on probability theory, \"The Doctrine of Chances: a method of calculating the probabilities of events in play\". (The first book about games of chance, \"Liber de ludo aleae\" (\"On Casting the Die\"), was written by Girolamo Cardano in the 1560s, but it was not published until 1663.) This book came out in four editions, 1711 in Latin, and in English in 1718, 1738, and 1756. In the later editions of his book, de Moivre included his unpublished result of 1733, which is the first statement of an approximation to the binomial distribution in terms of what we now call the normal or Gaussian function. This was the first method of finding the probability of the occurrence of an error of a given size when that error is expressed in terms of the variability of the distribution as a unit, and the first identification of the calculation of probable error. In addition, he applied these theories to gambling problems and actuarial tables.\nAn expression commonly found in probability is \"n\"! but before the days of calculators calculating \"n\"! for a large \"n\" was time-consuming. In 1733 de Moivre proposed the formula for estimating a factorial as \"n\"!\u00a0=\u00a0\"cn\"(\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01/2)\"e\"\u2212\"n\". He obtained an approximate expression for the constant \"c\" but it was James Stirling who found that \"c\" is \u221a.\nDe Moivre also published an article called \"Annuities upon Lives\" in which he revealed the normal distribution of the mortality rate over a person's age. From this he produced a simple formula for approximating the revenue produced by annual payments based on a person's age. This is similar to the types of formulas used by insurance companies today.\nPriority regarding the Poisson distribution.\nSome results on the Poisson distribution were first introduced by de Moivre in \"De Mensura Sortis seu; de Probabilitate Eventuum in Ludis a Casu Fortuito Pendentibus\" in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, p.\u00a0219. As a result, some authors have argued that the Poisson distribution should bear the name of de Moivre.\nDe Moivre's formula.\nIn 1707, de Moivre derived an equation from which one can deduce:\n formula_1\nwhich he was able to prove for all positive integers\u00a0\"n\". In 1722, he presented equations from which one can deduce the better known form of de Moivre's Formula:\n formula_2\nIn 1749 Euler proved this formula for any real n using Euler's formula, which makes the proof quite straightforward. This formula is important because it relates complex numbers and trigonometry. Additionally, this formula allows the derivation of useful expressions for cos(\"nx\") and sin(\"nx\") in terms of cos(\"x\") and sin(\"x\").\nStirling's approximation.\nDe Moivre had been studying probability, and his investigations required him to calculate binomial coefficients, which in turn required him to calculate factorials. In 1730 de Moivre published his book \"Miscellanea Analytica de Seriebus et Quadraturis\" [Analytic Miscellany of Series and Integrals], which included tables of log (\"n\"!). For large values of \"n\", de Moivre approximated the coefficients of the terms in a binomial expansion. Specifically, given a positive integer \"n\", where \"n\" is even and large, then the coefficient of the middle term of (a\u00a0+\u00a0b)\"n\" is approximated by the equation:\nformula_3\nOn June 19, 1729, James Stirling sent to de Moivre a letter, which illustrated how he calculated the coefficient of the middle term of a binomial expansion (\"a\" + \"b\")\"n\" for large values of \"n\". In 1730, Stirling published his book \"Methodus Differentialis\" [The Differential Method], in which he included his series for log(\"n\"!):\nformula_4\nso that for large formula_5, formula_6.\nOn November 12, 1733, de Moivre privately published and distributed a pamphlet \u2013 \"Approximatio ad Summam Terminorum Binomii\" (\"a\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"b\")\"n\" \"in Seriem expansi\" [Approximation of the Sum of the Terms of the Binomial (\"a\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"b\")\"n\" expanded into a Series] \u2013 in which he acknowledged Stirling's letter and proposed an alternative expression for the central term of a binomial expansion.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57328", "revid": "50835563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57328", "title": "Julius Caesar (play)", "text": "Play by William Shakespeare (1564-1616)\nThe Tragedy of Julius Caesar (First Folio title: The Tragedie of Ivlivs C\u00e6sar), often shortened to Julius Caesar, is a historical tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written and first performed in 1599. The play portrays the political conspiracy that led to the assassination of the Roman dictator Julius Caesar and Rome's subsequent civil war. Drawing primarily (with deviations in various aspects) from Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of \"Parallel Lives\" by Plutarch, Shakespeare presents a dramatised account of Caesar's growing power, his murder by a group of senators led by Cassius and Brutus, and the defeat of the conspirators by the forces of Mark Antony and Octavius at the Battle of Philippi.\nAlthough named after Caesar, the play focuses largely on Brutus, whose moral and political dilemmas have often led critics to regard him as its tragic hero. Central themes include the tension between personal loyalty and public duty, the use of rhetoric in politics, and the fragility of republican governance in the face of ambition and power.\nJulius Caesar was among the first plays performed at the Globe Theatre and has remained one of Shakespeare\u2019s most frequently staged works. It has been adapted in numerous forms and interpreted in diverse political contexts, reflecting concerns from Elizabethan debates on succession to modern discussions of dictatorship and democracy. The play is widely studied for its exploration of character, persuasion, and political morality, and it continues to influence literature, theater, and political discourse.\nSynopsis.\nThe play opens with two tribunes Flavius and Marullus (appointed leaders/officials of Rome) discovering the commoners of Rome celebrating Julius Caesar's triumphant return from defeating the sons of his military rival, Pompey. The tribunes, insulting the crowd for their change in loyalty from Pompey to Caesar, attempt to end the festivities and break up the commoners, who return the insults. During the feast of Lupercal, Caesar holds a victory parade and a soothsayer warns him to \"Beware the ides of March,\" which he ignores. Meanwhile, Cassius attempts to convince Brutus to join his conspiracy to kill Caesar. Although Brutus, friendly towards Caesar, is hesitant to kill him, he agrees that Caesar may be abusing his power. They then hear from Casca that Mark Antony has offered Caesar the crown of Rome three times. Casca tells them that each time Caesar refused it with increasing reluctance, hoping that the crowd watching would insist that he accept the crown. He describes how the crowd applauded Caesar for denying the crown, and how this upset Caesar. On the eve of the ides of March, the conspirators meet and reveal that they have forged letters of support from the Roman people to tempt Brutus into joining. Brutus reads the letters and, after much moral debate, decides to join the conspiracy, thinking that Caesar should be killed to \"prevent\" him from doing anything against the people of Rome if he were ever to be crowned.\nAfter ignoring the soothsayer, as well as his wife Calpurnia's own premonitions, Caesar goes to the Senate. The conspirators approach him with a fake petition pleading on behalf of Metellus Cimber's banished brother. As Caesar predictably rejects the petition, Casca and the others suddenly stab him; Brutus is last. At this, Caesar asks \"Et tu, Brute?\" (\"You too, Brutus?\"), concluding with \"Then fall, Caesar!\"\nThe conspirators attempt to demonstrate that they killed Caesar for the good of Rome, to prevent an autocrat. They prove this by not attempting to flee the scene. Brutus delivers an oration defending his actions, and for the moment, the crowd is on his side. However, Antony makes a subtle and eloquent speech over Caesar's corpse, beginning \"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!\" He deftly turns public opinion against the assassins by manipulating the emotions of the common people, in contrast to the rational tone of Brutus's speech, yet there is a method in his rhetorical speech and gestures. Antony reminds the crowd of the good Caesar had done for Rome, his sympathy with the poor, and his refusal of the crown at the Lupercal, thus questioning Brutus's claim of Caesar's ambition; he shows Caesar's bloody, lifeless body to the crowd to have them shed tears and gain sympathy for their fallen hero; and he reads Caesar's will, in which every Roman citizen would receive 75 drachmas. Antony, even as he states his intentions against it, rouses the mob to drive the conspirators from Rome. The mob takes Caesar's body to the Forum, lights his funeral pyre, and uses the pyre to light up torches for burning down the homes of the conspirators. Amid the violence, an innocent poet, Cinna, is confused with the conspirator Lucius Cinna and is taken by the mob, which kills him for such \"offences\" as his bad verses.\nBrutus then attacks Cassius for supposedly soiling the noble act of regicide by having accepted bribes. (\"Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake? / What villain touched his body, that did stab, / And not for justice?\") The two are reconciled, especially after Brutus reveals that his beloved wife committed suicide under the stress of his absence from Rome; they prepare for a civil war against Antony, Caesar's adopted son Octavius, and Lepidus who have formed a triumvirate in Rome. That night, Caesar's ghost appears to Brutus with a warning of defeat. (He informs Brutus, \"Thou shalt see me at Philippi.\")\nAt the Battle of Philippi, Cassius and Brutus, knowing that they will probably both die, smile their last smiles to each other and hold hands. During the battle, Cassius has his servant kill him after hearing of the capture of his best friend, Titinius. After Titinius, who was not captured, sees Cassius's corpse, he commits suicide. However, Brutus wins that stage of the battle, but his victory is not conclusive. With a heavy heart, Brutus battles again the next day. He asks his friends to kill him, but the friends refuse. He loses and commits suicide by running on his sword, held for him by a loyal soldier.\nThe play ends with a tribute to Brutus by Antony, who proclaims that Brutus has remained \"the noblest Roman of them all\" because he was the only conspirator who acted, in his mind, for the good of Rome. There is then a small hint at the friction between Antony and Octavius which characterizes another of Shakespeare's Roman plays, \"Antony and Cleopatra.\"\nCharacters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\"Triumvirs after Caesar's death\"\n\"Conspirators against Caesar\"\n\"Tribunes\"\n\"Roman Senate Senators\"\n\"Citizens\"\n\"Loyal to Brutus and Cassius\"\n\"Other\"\nSources.\nThe main source of the play is Thomas North's translation of Plutarch's \"Lives\".\nDeviations from Plutarch.\nShakespeare deviated from these historical facts to curtail time and compress the facts so that the play could be staged more easily. The tragic force is condensed into a few scenes for heightened effect.\nDate and text.\n\"Julius Caesar\" was originally published in the First Folio of 1623, but a performance was mentioned by Thomas Platter the Younger in his diary in September 1599. The play is not mentioned in the list of Shakespeare's plays published by Francis Meres in 1598. Based on these two points, as well as several contemporary allusions, and the belief that the play is similar to \"Hamlet\" in vocabulary, and to \"Henry V\" and \"As You Like It\" in metre, scholars have suggested 1599 as a probable date.\nThe text of \"Julius Caesar\" in the First Folio is the only authoritative text for the play. The Folio text is notable for its quality and consistency; scholars judge it to have been set into type from a theatrical prompt-book.\nThe play contains many anachronistic elements from the Elizabethan era. The characters mention objects such as doublets (large, heavy jackets) \u2013 which did not exist in ancient Rome. Caesar is mentioned to be wearing an Elizabethan doublet instead of a Roman toga. At one point a clock is heard to strike and Brutus notes it with \"Count the clock\".\nAnalysis and criticism.\nHistorical background.\nJulius Caesar was written around 1599, during the reign of Elizabeth I, a period marked by political uncertainty regarding the succession to the English throne. Although England was at peace, Elizabeth had refused to name her successor, which raised concerns about potential instability, rebellion, or the possibility of a civil war similar to that of Rome unfolding after her death. Maria Wyke has written that the play reflects this general anxiety over the royal succession. Shakespeare\u2019s dramatisation of Caesar\u2019s assassination and the subsequent civil war would have resonated with Elizabethan audiences aware of these anxieties.\nProtagonist debate.\nCritics of Shakespeare's play \"Julius Caesar\" differ greatly in their views of Caesar and Brutus. Many have debated whether Caesar or Brutus is the protagonist of the play. Intertwined in this debate is a smattering of philosophical and psychological ideologies on republicanism and monarchism. One author, Robert C. Reynolds, devotes attention to the names or epithets given to both Brutus and Caesar in his essay \"Ironic Epithet in \"Julius Caesar\"\". He points out that Casca praises Brutus at face value, but then inadvertently compares him to a disreputable joke of a man by calling him an alchemist, \"Oh, he sits high in all the people's hearts,/And that which would appear offense in us/ His countenance, like richest alchemy,/ Will change to virtue and worthiness\" (I.iii.158\u2013160). Reynolds also talks about Caesar and his \"Colossus\" epithet, which he points out has obvious connotations of power and manliness, but also lesser-known connotations of an outward glorious front and inward chaos.\nMyron Taylor, in his essay \"Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\" and the Irony of History\", compares the logic and philosophies of Caesar and Brutus. Caesar is deemed an intuitive philosopher who is always right when he goes with his instinct; for instance, when he says he fears Cassius as a threat to him before he is killed, his intuition is correct. Brutus is portrayed as a man similar to Caesar, but whose passions lead him to the wrong reasoning, which he realizes in the end when he says in V.v.50\u201351, \"Caesar, now be still:/ I killed not thee with half so good a will\".\nJoseph W. Houppert acknowledges that some critics have tried to cast Caesar as the protagonist, but that ultimately Brutus is the driving force in the play and is, therefore, the tragic hero. Brutus attempts to put the republic over his relationship with Caesar and kills him. Brutus makes the political mistakes that bring down the republic that his ancestors created. He acts on his passions, does not gather enough evidence to make reasonable decisions, and is manipulated by Cassius and the other conspirators.\nTraditional readings of the play may maintain that Cassius and the other conspirators are motivated largely by envy and ambition, whereas Brutus is motivated by the demands of honor and patriotism. Certainly, this is the view that Antony expresses in the final scene. But one of the central strengths of the play is that it resists categorising its characters as either simple heroes or villains. The political journalist and classicist Garry Wills maintains that \"This play is distinctive because it has no villains\". It is a drama famous for the difficulty of deciding which role to emphasise. The characters rotate around each other like the plates of a Calder mobile. Touch one and it affects the position of all the others. Raise one, and another sinks. But they keep coming back into a precarious balance.\nPerformance history.\nThe play was probably one of Shakespeare's first to be performed at the Globe Theatre. Thomas Platter the Younger, a Swiss traveler, saw a tragedy about Julius Caesar at a Bankside theatre on 21 September 1599, and this was most likely Shakespeare's play, as there is no obvious alternative candidate. (While the story of Julius Caesar was dramatized repeatedly in the Elizabethan/Jacobean period, none of the other plays known is as good a match with Platter's description as Shakespeare's play.)\nAfter the theatres re-opened at the start of the Restoration era, the play was revived by Thomas Killigrew's King's Company in 1672. Charles Hart initially played Brutus, as did Thomas Betterton in later productions. \"Julius Caesar\" was one of the very few Shakespeare plays that was not adapted during the Restoration period or the eighteenth century.\nAdaptations and cultural references.\nOne of the earliest cultural references to the play came in Shakespeare's own \"Hamlet\". Prince Hamlet asks Polonius about his career as a thespian at university, and Polonius replies: \"I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed in the Capitol. Brutus killed me.\" This is a likely meta-reference, as Richard Burbage is generally accepted to have played leading men Brutus and Hamlet, and the older John Heminges to have played Caesar and Polonius.\nIn 1851, the German composer Robert Schumann wrote a concert overture \"Julius Caesar\", inspired by Shakespeare's play. Other musical settings include those by Giovanni Bononcini, Hans von B\u00fclow, Felix Draeseke, Josef Bohuslav Foerster, John Ireland, John Foulds, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Manfred Gurlitt, Darius Milhaud, and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.\nThe Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster parodied \"Julius Caesar\" in their 1958 sketch \"Rinse the Blood off My Toga\". Flavius Maximus, Private Roman Eye, is hired by Brutus to investigate the death of Caesar. The police procedural combines Shakespeare, \"Dragnet\", and vaudeville jokes and was first broadcast on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".\nIn 1984, the Riverside Shakespeare Company of New York City produced a modern dress \"Julius Caesar\" set in contemporary Washington, called simply \"CAESAR!\", starring Harold Scott as Brutus, Herman Petras as Caesar, Marya Lowry as Portia, Robert Walsh as Antony, and Michael Cook as Cassius, directed by W. Stuart McDowell at The Shakespeare Center.\nIn 2006, Chris Taylor from the Australian comedy team The Chaser wrote a comedy musical called \"Dead Caesar\" which was shown at the Sydney Theatre Company in Sydney.\nThe line \"The Evil That Men Do\", from the speech made by Mark Antony following Caesar's death (\"The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones.\") has had many references in media, including the titles of:\nThe 2008 movie \"Me and Orson Welles\", based on a book of the same name by Robert Kaplow, is a fictional story centered around Orson Welles' famous 1937 production of \"Julius Caesar\" at the Mercury Theatre. British actor Christian McKay is cast as Welles, and co-stars with Zac Efron and Claire Danes.\nThe 2012 Italian drama film \"Caesar Must Die\" (), directed by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, follows convicts in their rehearsals ahead of a prison performance of \"Julius Caesar\".\nIn the Ray Bradbury book \"Fahrenheit 451\", some of the character Beatty's last words are \"There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am armed so strong in honesty that they pass me as an idle wind, which I respect not!\"\nThe play's line \"the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves\", spoken by Cassius in Act I, scene 2, is often referenced in popular culture. The line gave its name to the J.M. Barrie play \"Dear Brutus\", and also gave its name to the best-selling young adult novel \"The Fault in Our Stars\" by John Green and its film adaptation. The same line was quoted in Edward R. Murrow's epilogue of his famous 1954 \"See It Now\" documentary broadcast concerning Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. This speech and the line were recreated in the 2005 film \"Good Night, and Good Luck\". It was also quoted by George Clooney's character in the Coen brothers film \"Intolerable Cruelty\".\nThe line \"And therefore think him as a serpent's egg / Which hatched, would, as his kind grow mischievous; And kill him in the shell\" spoken by Brutus in Act II, Scene 1, is referenced in the Dead Kennedys song \"California \u00fcber alles\".\nThe title of Agatha Christie's novel \"Taken at the Flood\", titled \"There Is a Tide\" in its American edition, refers to an iconic line of Brutus: \"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.\" (Act IV, Scene III).\nThe line \"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures\" is recited by Jean-Luc Picard at the end of the ' series finale, \".\" The play was previously discussed in a conversation between Julian Bashir and Elim Garak in the ' episode \"Improbable Cause\".\nFilm and television adaptations.\n\"Julius Caesar\" has been adapted to a number of film productions, including:\nContemporary political references.\nModern adaptions of the play have often made contemporary political references, with Caesar depicted as resembling a variety of political leaders, including Huey Long, Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair, as well as Fidel Castro and Oliver North. Scholar A. J. Hartley stated that this is a fairly \"common trope\" of \"Julius Caesar\" performances: \"Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, the rule has been to create a recognizable political world within the production. And often people in the title role itself look like or feel like somebody either in recent or current politics.\" A 2012 production of \"Julius Caesar\" by the Guthrie Theater and The Acting Company \"presented Caesar in the guise of a black actor who was meant to suggest President Obama.\" This production was not particularly controversial.\nIn 2017, however, a modern adaptation of the play at New York's Shakespeare in the Park (performed by The Public Theater) depicted Caesar with the likeness of then-president Donald Trump and thereby aroused ferocious controversy, drawing criticism by media outlets such as \"The Daily Caller\" and \"Breitbart\" and prompting corporate sponsors Bank of America and Delta Air Lines to pull their financial support. The Public Theater stated that the message of the play is not pro-assassination and that the point is that \"those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save.\" Shakespeare scholars Stephen Greenblatt and Peter Holland agreed with this statement. Pallotta stated that \"I have never read anyone suggesting that 'Julius Caesar' is a play that recommends assassination. Look what happens: Caesar is assassinated to stop him from becoming a dictator. Result: civil war, massive slaughter, creation of an emperor, execution of many who sympathized with the conspiracy. Doesn't look much like a successful result for the conspirators to me.\" The play was interrupted several times by right-wing protesters, who accused the play of \"violence against the right\", and actors and members of theatres with Shakespeare in the name were harassed and received death threats, including the wife of the play's director Oskar Eustis. The protests were praised by American Family Association director Sandy Rios who compared the play with the execution of Christians by damnatio ad bestias.\nThe 2018 Bridge Theatre production also incorporates modern political imagery. The commoners in the first scene sing modern punk music and Caesar distributes red hats to the audience that are remarkably similar to Donald Trump's campaign merchandise. The conspirators also use modern firearms during the assassination and the Battle of Phillipi.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It includes the cardiovascular system, or vascular system, that consists of the heart and blood vessels (from Greek meaning \"heart\", and Latin meaning \"vessels\"). The circulatory system has two divisions, a systemic circulation or circuit, and a pulmonary circulation or circuit. Some sources use the terms \"cardiovascular system\" and \"vascular system\" interchangeably with \"circulatory system\".\nThe network of blood vessels are the great vessels of the heart including large elastic arteries, and large veins; other arteries, smaller arterioles, capillaries that join with venules (small veins), and other veins. The circulatory system is closed in vertebrates, which means that the blood never leaves the network of blood vessels. Many invertebrates such as arthropods have an open circulatory system with a heart that pumps a hemolymph which returns via the body cavity rather than via blood vessels. Diploblasts such as sponges and comb jellies lack a circulatory system.\nBlood is a fluid consisting of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; it is circulated around the body carrying oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and collecting and disposing of waste materials. Circulated nutrients include proteins and minerals and other components include hemoglobin, hormones, and gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. These substances provide nourishment, help the immune system to fight diseases, and help maintain homeostasis by stabilizing temperature and natural pH.\nIn vertebrates, the lymphatic system is complementary to the circulatory system. The lymphatic system carries excess plasma (filtered from the circulatory system capillaries as interstitial fluid between cells) away from the body tissues via accessory routes that return excess fluid back to blood circulation as lymph. The lymphatic system is a subsystem that is essential for the functioning of the blood circulatory system; without it the blood would become depleted of fluid.\nThe lymphatic system also works with the immune system. The circulation of lymph takes much longer than that of blood and, unlike the closed (blood) circulatory system, the lymphatic system is an open system. Some sources describe it as a \"secondary circulatory system\".\nThe circulatory system can be affected by many cardiovascular diseases. Cardiologists are medical professionals which specialise in the heart, and cardiothoracic surgeons specialise in operating on the heart and its surrounding areas. Vascular surgeons focus on disorders of the blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels.\nStructure.\nThe circulatory system includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The cardiovascular system in all vertebrates, consists of the heart and blood vessels. Some sources use the terms \"cardiovascular system\" and \"vascular system\" interchangeably with \"circulatory system\".\nThe circulatory system is further divided into two major circuits \u2013 a pulmonary circulation, and a systemic circulation. The pulmonary circulation is a circuit loop from the right heart taking deoxygenated blood to the lungs where it is oxygenated and returned to the left heart. The systemic circulation is a circuit loop that delivers oxygenated blood from the left heart to the rest of the body, and returns deoxygenated blood back to the right heart via large veins known as the venae cavae. The systemic circulation can also be defined as two parts \u2013 a \"macrocirculation\" and a \"microcirculation\". An average adult contains five to six quarts (roughly 4.7 to 5.7 liters) of blood, accounting for approximately 7% of their total body weight. Blood consists of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The digestive system also works with the circulatory system to provide the nutrients the system needs to keep the heart pumping.\nFurther circulatory routes are associated, such as the coronary circulation to the heart itself, the cerebral circulation to the brain, renal circulation to the kidneys, and bronchial circulation to the bronchi in the lungs. The human circulatory system is closed, meaning that the blood is contained within the vascular network. Nutrients travel through tiny blood vessels of the microcirculation to reach organs. The lymphatic system is an essential subsystem of the circulatory system consisting of a network of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, organs, tissues and circulating lymph. This subsystem is an open system. A major function is to carry the lymph, draining and returning interstitial fluid into the lymphatic ducts back to the heart for return to the circulatory system. Another major function is working together with the immune system to provide defense against pathogens.\nHeart.\nThe heart pumps blood to all parts of the body. In the human heart there is one atrium and one ventricle for each circulation, and with both a systemic and a pulmonary circulation there are four chambers in total: left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium and right ventricle.\nPulmonary circulation.\nOxygen-deprived blood from the superior and inferior vena cava enters the right atrium of the heart and flows through the tricuspid valve (right atrioventricular valve) into the right ventricle, from which it is then pumped through the pulmonary semilunar valve into the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Gas exchange occurs in the lungs, whereby CO2 is released from the blood, and oxygen is absorbed. The pulmonary vein returns the now oxygen-rich blood to the left atrium.\nA separate circuit from the systemic circulation, the bronchial circulation supplies blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung.\nSystemic circulation.\nThe systemic circulation is a circuit loop that delivers oxygenated blood from the left heart to the rest of the body through the aorta. Deoxygenated blood is returned in the systemic circulation to the right heart via two large veins, the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava, where it is pumped from the right atrium into the pulmonary circulation for oxygenation. The systemic circulation can also be defined as having two parts \u2013 a macrocirculation and a microcirculation.\nBlood vessels.\nThe blood vessels of the circulatory system are the arteries, veins, and capillaries. The large arteries and veins that take blood to, and away from the heart are known as the great vessels.\nArteries.\nOxygenated blood enters the systemic circulation when leaving the left ventricle, via the aortic semilunar valve. The first part of the systemic circulation is the aorta, a massive and thick-walled artery. The aorta arches and gives branches supplying the upper part of the body after passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm at the level of thoracic ten vertebra, it enters the abdomen. Later, it descends down and supplies branches to abdomen, pelvis, perineum and the lower limbs.\nThe walls of the aorta are elastic. This elasticity helps to maintain the blood pressure throughout the body. When the aorta receives almost five litres of blood from the heart, it recoils and is responsible for pulsating blood pressure. As the aorta branches into smaller arteries, their elasticity goes on decreasing and their compliance goes on increasing.\nCapillaries.\nArteries branch into small passages called arterioles and then into the capillaries. The capillaries merge to bring blood into the venous system. The total length of muscle capillaries in a 70 kg human is estimated to be between 9,000 and 19,000 km.\nVeins.\nCapillaries merge into venules, which merge into veins. The venous system feeds into the two major veins: the superior vena cava \u2013 which mainly drains tissues above the heart \u2013 and the inferior vena cava \u2013 which mainly drains tissues below the heart. These two large veins empty into the right atrium of the heart.\nPortal veins.\nThe general rule is that arteries from the heart branch out into capillaries, which collect into veins leading back to the heart. Portal veins are a slight exception to this. In humans, the only significant example is the hepatic portal vein which combines from capillaries around the gastrointestinal tract where the blood absorbs the various products of digestion; rather than leading directly back to the heart, the hepatic portal vein branches into a second capillary system in the liver.\nCoronary circulation.\nThe heart itself is supplied with oxygen and nutrients through a small \"loop\" of the systemic circulation and derives very little from the blood contained within the four chambers.\nThe coronary circulation system provides a blood supply to the heart muscle itself. The coronary circulation begins near the origin of the aorta by two coronary arteries: the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery. After nourishing the heart muscle, blood returns through the coronary veins into the coronary sinus and from this one into the right atrium. Backflow of blood through its opening during atrial systole is prevented by the Thebesian valve. The smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the heart chambers.\nCerebral circulation.\nThe brain has a dual blood supply, an \"anterior\" and a \"posterior circulation\" from arteries at its front and back. The anterior circulation arises from the internal carotid arteries to supply the front of the brain. The posterior circulation arises from the vertebral arteries, to supply the back of the brain and brainstem. The circulation from the front and the back join (anastomise) at the circle of Willis. The neurovascular unit, composed of various cells and vasculature channels within the brain, regulates the flow of blood to activated neurons in order to satisfy their high energy demands.\nRenal circulation.\nThe renal circulation is the blood supply to the kidneys, contains many specialized blood vessels and receives around 20% of the cardiac output. It branches from the abdominal aorta and returns blood to the ascending inferior vena cava.\nDevelopment.\nThe development of the circulatory system starts with vasculogenesis in the embryo. The human arterial and venous systems develop from different areas in the embryo. The arterial system develops mainly from the aortic arches, six pairs of arches that develop on the upper part of the embryo. The venous system arises from three bilateral veins during weeks 4\u00a0\u2013 8 of embryogenesis. Fetal circulation begins within the 8th week of development. Fetal circulation does not include the lungs, which are bypassed via the truncus arteriosus. Before birth the fetus obtains oxygen (and nutrients) from the mother through the placenta and the umbilical cord.\nArteries.\nThe human arterial system originates from the aortic arches and from the dorsal aortae starting from week 4 of embryonic life. The first and second aortic arches regress and form only the maxillary arteries and stapedial arteries respectively. The arterial system itself arises from aortic arches 3, 4 and 6 (aortic arch 5 completely regresses).\nThe dorsal aortae, present on the dorsal side of the embryo, are initially present on both sides of the embryo. They later fuse to form the basis for the aorta itself. Approximately thirty smaller arteries branch from this at the back and sides. These branches form the intercostal arteries, arteries of the arms and legs, lumbar arteries and the lateral sacral arteries. Branches to the sides of the aorta will form the definitive renal, suprarenal and gonadal arteries. Finally, branches at the front of the aorta consist of the vitelline arteries and umbilical arteries. The vitelline arteries form the celiac, superior and inferior mesenteric arteries of the gastrointestinal tract. After birth, the umbilical arteries will form the internal iliac arteries.\nVeins.\nThe human venous system develops mainly from the vitelline veins, the umbilical veins and the cardinal veins, all of which empty into the sinus venosus.\nFunction.\nAbout 98.5% of the oxygen in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human, breathing air at sea-level pressure, is chemically combined with hemoglobin molecules. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in vertebrates.\nClinical significance.\nMany diseases affect the circulatory system. These include a number of cardiovascular diseases, affecting the heart and blood vessels; hematologic diseases that affect the blood, such as anemia, and lymphatic diseases affecting the lymphatic system. Cardiologists are medical professionals which specialise in the heart, and cardiothoracic surgeons specialise in operating on the heart and its surrounding areas. Vascular surgeons focus on the blood vessels.\nCardiovascular disease.\nDiseases affecting the cardiovascular system are called \"cardiovascular disease\".\nMany of these diseases are called \"lifestyle diseases\" because they develop over time and are related to a person's exercise habits, diet, whether they smoke, and other lifestyle choices a person makes. Atherosclerosis is the precursor to many of these diseases. It is where small atheromatous plaques build up in the walls of medium and large arteries. This may eventually grow or rupture to occlude the arteries. It is also a risk factor for acute coronary syndromes, which are diseases that are characterised by a sudden deficit of oxygenated blood to the heart tissue. Atherosclerosis is also associated with problems such as aneurysm formation or splitting (\"dissection\") of arteries.\nAnother major cardiovascular disease involves the creation of a clot, called a \"thrombus\". These can originate in veins or arteries. Deep venous thrombosis, which mostly occurs in the legs, is one cause of clots in the veins of the legs, particularly when a person has been stationary for a long time. These clots may embolise, meaning travel to another location in the body. The results of this may include pulmonary embolus, transient ischaemic attacks, or stroke.\nCardiovascular diseases may also be congenital in nature, such as heart defects or persistent fetal circulation, where the circulatory changes that are supposed to happen after birth do not. Not all congenital changes to the circulatory system are associated with diseases, a large number are anatomical variations.\nInvestigations.\nThe function and health of the circulatory system and its parts are measured in a variety of manual and automated ways. These include simple methods such as those that are part of the cardiovascular examination, including the taking of a person's pulse as an indicator of a person's heart rate, the taking of blood pressure through a sphygmomanometer or the use of a stethoscope to listen to the heart for murmurs which may indicate problems with the heart's valves. An electrocardiogram can also be used to evaluate the way in which electricity is conducted through the heart.\nOther more invasive means can also be used. A cannula or catheter inserted into an artery may be used to measure pulse pressure or pulmonary wedge pressures. Angiography, which involves injecting a dye into an artery to visualise an arterial tree, can be used in the heart (coronary angiography) or brain. At the same time as the arteries are visualised, blockages or narrowings may be fixed through the insertion of stents, and active bleeds may be managed by the insertion of coils. An MRI may be used to image arteries, called an MRI angiogram. For evaluation of the blood supply to the lungs a CT pulmonary angiogram may be used. Vascular ultrasonography may be used to investigate vascular diseases affecting the venous system and the arterial system including the diagnosis of stenosis, thrombosis or venous insufficiency. An intravascular ultrasound using a catheter is also an option.\nSurgery.\nThere are a number of surgical procedures performed on the circulatory system:\nCardiovascular procedures are more likely to be performed in an inpatient setting than in an ambulatory care setting; in the United States, only 28% of cardiovascular surgeries were performed in the ambulatory care setting.\nOther animals.\nWhile humans, as well as other vertebrates, have a closed blood circulatory system (meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries, veins and capillaries), some invertebrate groups have an open circulatory system containing a heart but limited blood vessels. The most primitive, diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems.\nAn additional transport system, the lymphatic system, which is only found in animals with a closed blood circulation, is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood.\nThe blood vascular system first appeared probably in an ancestor of the triploblasts over 600 million years ago, overcoming the time-distance constraints of diffusion, while endothelium evolved in an ancestral vertebrate some 540\u2013510 million years ago.\nOpen circulatory system.\nIn arthropods, the open circulatory system is a system in which a fluid in a cavity called the hemocoel or haemocoel bathes the organs directly with oxygen and nutrients, with there being no distinction between blood and interstitial fluid; this combined fluid is called hemolymph or haemolymph. Muscular movements by the animal during locomotion can facilitate hemolymph movement, but diverting flow from one area to another is limited. When the heart relaxes, blood is drawn back toward the heart through open-ended pores (ostia).\nHemolymph fills all of the interior hemocoel of the body and surrounds all cells. Hemolymph is composed of water, inorganic salts (mostly sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium, and calcium), and organic compounds (mostly carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). The primary oxygen transporter molecule is hemocyanin.\nThere are free-floating cells, the hemocytes, within the hemolymph. They play a role in the arthropod immune system.\nClosed circulatory system.\nThe circulatory systems of all vertebrates, as well as of annelids (for example, earthworms) and cephalopods (squids, octopuses and relatives) always keep their circulating blood enclosed within heart chambers or blood vessels and are classified as \"closed\", just as in humans. Still, the systems of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds show various stages of the evolution of the circulatory system. Closed systems permit blood to be directed to the organs that require it.\nIn fish, the system has only one circuit, with the blood being pumped through the capillaries of the gills and on to the capillaries of the body tissues. This is known as \"single cycle\" circulation. The heart of fish is, therefore, only a single pump (consisting of two chambers).\nIn amphibians and most reptiles, a double circulatory system is used, but the heart is not always completely separated into two pumps. Amphibians have a three-chambered heart.\nIn reptiles, the ventricular septum of the heart is incomplete and the pulmonary artery is equipped with a sphincter muscle. This allows a second possible route of blood flow. Instead of blood flowing through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, the sphincter may be contracted to divert this blood flow through the incomplete ventricular septum into the left ventricle and out through the aorta. This means the blood flows from the capillaries to the heart and back to the capillaries instead of to the lungs. This process is useful to ectothermic (cold-blooded) animals in the regulation of their body temperature.\nMammals, birds and crocodilians show complete separation of the heart into two pumps, for a total of four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of birds and crocodilians evolved independently from that of mammals. Double circulatory systems permit blood to be repressurized after returning from the lungs, speeding up delivery of oxygen to tissues.\nNo circulatory system.\nCirculatory systems are absent in some animals, including flatworms. Their body cavity has no lining or enclosed fluid. Instead, a muscular pharynx leads to an extensively branched digestive system that facilitates direct diffusion of nutrients to all cells. The flatworm's dorso-ventrally flattened body shape also restricts the distance of any cell from the digestive system or the exterior of the organism. Oxygen can diffuse from the surrounding water into the cells, and carbon dioxide can diffuse out. Consequently, every cell is able to obtain nutrients, water and oxygen without the need of a transport system.\nSome animals, such as jellyfish, have more extensive branching from their gastrovascular cavity (which functions as both a place of digestion and a form of circulation), this branching allows for bodily fluids to reach the outer layers, since the digestion begins in the inner layers.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known writings on the circulatory system are found in the Ebers Papyrus (16th century BCE), an ancient Egyptian medical papyrus containing over 700 prescriptions and remedies, both physical and spiritual. In the papyrus, it acknowledges the connection of the heart to the arteries. The Egyptians thought air came in through the mouth and into the lungs and heart. From the heart, the air travelled to every member through the arteries. Although this concept of the circulatory system is only partially correct, it represents one of the earliest accounts of scientific thought.\nIn the 6th century BCE, the knowledge of circulation of vital fluids through the body was known to the Ayurvedic physician Sushruta in ancient India. He also seems to have possessed knowledge of the arteries, described as 'channels' by Dwivedi &amp; Dwivedi (2007). The first major ancient Greek research into the circulatory system was completed by Plato in the \"Timaeus\", who argues that blood circulates around the body in accordance with the general rules that govern the motions of the elements in the body; accordingly, he does not place much importance in the heart itself. The valves of the heart were discovered by a physician of the Hippocratic school around the early 3rd century BC. However, their function was not properly understood then. Because blood pools in the veins after death, arteries look empty. Ancient anatomists assumed they were filled with air and that they were for the transport of air.\nThe Greek physician, Herophilus, distinguished veins from arteries but thought that the pulse was a property of arteries themselves. Greek anatomist Erasistratus observed that arteries that were cut during life bleed. He ascribed the fact to the phenomenon that air escaping from an artery is replaced with blood that enters between veins and arteries by very small vessels. Thus he apparently postulated capillaries but with reversed flow of blood.\nIn 2nd-century AD Rome, the Greek physician Galen knew that blood vessels carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Growth and energy were derived from venous blood created in the liver from chyle, while arterial blood gave vitality by containing pneuma (air) and originated in the heart. Blood flowed from both creating organs to all parts of the body where it was consumed and there was no return of blood to the heart or liver. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Galen believed that the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right by passing through 'pores' in the interventricular septum, air passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart. As the arterial blood was created 'sooty' vapors were created and passed to the lungs also via the pulmonary artery to be exhaled.\nIn 1025, \"The Canon of Medicine\" by the Persian physician, Avicenna, \"erroneously accepted the Greek notion regarding the existence of a hole in the ventricular septum by which the blood traveled between the ventricles.\" Despite this, Avicenna \"correctly wrote on the cardiac cycles and valvular function\", and \"had a vision of blood circulation\" in his \"Treatise on Pulse\". While also refining Galen's erroneous theory of the pulse, Avicenna provided the first correct explanation of pulsation: \"Every beat of the pulse comprises two movements and two pauses. Thus, expansion : pause : contraction : pause. [...] The pulse is a movement in the heart and arteries ... which takes the form of alternate expansion and contraction.\"\nIn 1242, the Arabian physician, Ibn al-Nafis described the process of pulmonary circulation in greater, more accurate detail than his predecessors, though he believed, as they did, in the notion of vital spirit (pneuma), which he believed was formed in the left ventricle. Ibn al-Nafis stated in his \"Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon\":\n...the blood from the right chamber of the heart must arrive at the left chamber but there is no direct pathway between them. The thick septum of the heart is not perforated and does not have visible pores as some people thought or invisible pores as Galen thought. The blood from the right chamber must flow through the vena arteriosa (pulmonary artery) to the lungs, spread through its substances, be mingled there with air, pass through the arteria venosa (pulmonary vein) to reach the left chamber of the heart and there form the vital spirit...\nIn addition, Ibn al-Nafis had an insight into what later became a larger theory of the capillary circulation. He stated that \"there must be small communications or pores (\"manafidh\" in Arabic) between the pulmonary artery and vein,\" a prediction that preceded the discovery of the capillary system by more than 400 years. Ibn al-Nafis' theory was confined to blood transit in the lungs and did not extend to the entire body.\nMichael Servetus was the first European to describe the function of pulmonary circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. He firstly described it in the \"Manuscript of Paris\" (near 1546), but this work was never published. And later he published this description, but in a theological treatise, \"Christianismi Restitutio\", not in a book on medicine. Only three copies of the book survived but these remained hidden for decades, the rest were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.\nA better known discovery of pulmonary circulation was by Vesalius's successor at Padua, Realdo Colombo, in 1559.\nFinally, the English physician William Harvey, a pupil of Hieronymus Fabricius (who had earlier described the valves of the veins without recognizing their function), performed a sequence of experiments and published his \"Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus\" in 1628, which \"demonstrated that there had to be a direct connection between the venous and arterial systems throughout the body, and not just the lungs. Most importantly, he argued that the beat of the heart produced a continuous circulation of blood through minute connections at the extremities of the body. This is a conceptual leap that was quite different from Ibn al-Nafis' refinement of the anatomy and bloodflow in the heart and lungs.\" This work, with its essentially correct exposition, slowly convinced the medical world. However, Harvey did not identify the capillary system connecting arteries and veins; this was discovered by Marcello Malpighi in 1661.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The perceived sounds are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of radar transponders during World War II. In 1961, the American neuroscientist Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish information on the nature of the microwave auditory effect. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of the auditory apparatus, although competing theories explain the results of holographic interferometry tests differently.\nResearch in the U.S..\nAllan H. Frey was the first American to publish on the microwave auditory effect (MAE). Frey's \"Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy\" appeared in the \"Journal of Applied Physiology\" in 1961. In his experiments, the subjects were discovered to be able to hear appropriately pulsed microwave radiation, from a distance of a few inches to hundreds of feet from the transmitter. In Frey's tests, a repetition rate of 50\u00a0Hz was used, with pulse width between 10\u201370 microseconds. The perceived loudness was found to be linked to the peak power density, instead of average power density. At 1.245\u00a0GHz, the peak power density for perception was below 80\u00a0mW/cm2. According to Frey, the induced sounds were described as \"a buzz, clicking, hiss, or knocking, depending on several transmitter parameters, i.e., pulse width and pulse-repetition rate\". By changing transmitter parameters, Frey was able to induce the \"perception of severe buffeting of the head, without such apparent vestibular symptoms as dizziness or nausea\". Other transmitter parameters induced a pins and needles sensation. Frey experimented with nerve-deaf subjects, and speculated that the human detecting mechanism was in the cochlea, but at the time of the experiment the results were inconclusive due to factors such as tinnitus.\nAuditory sensations of clicking or buzzing have been reported by some workers at modern-day microwave transmitting sites that emit pulsed microwave radiation. Auditory responses to transmitted frequencies from approximately 200\u00a0MHz to at least 3\u00a0GHz have been reported. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of auditory apparatus, and the generally accepted mechanism is rapid (but minuscule, in the range of 10\u22125 \u00b0C) heating of brain by each pulse, and the resulting pressure wave traveling through the skull to the cochlea.\nIn 1975, an article by neuropsychologist Don Justesen discussing radiation effects on human perception referred to an experiment by Joseph C. Sharp and Mark Grove at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research during which Sharp and Grove reportedly were able to recognize nine out of ten words transmitted by \"voice modulated microwaves\". Although it's been reported that \"power levels required for transmitting sound... [would cause] brain damage due to... thermal effects\", the pops associated with the microwave audio effect are not sustained over time, and the effect is due to brief, sudden increases in temperature. In 1961, Frey reported the threshold levels for the microwave audio effect of 267\u00a0mW/cm\u00b2 to be at 1.3\u00a0GHz and 5000\u00a0mW/cm\u00b2 at 2.9\u00a0GHz for the peak amplitude (providing the pops), respectively. They would only give an average (sustained) power density of only about 0.4\u00a0mW/cm\u00b2 and 2\u00a0mW/cm\u00b2, respectively, similar to current cellphones. However, it's been argued that despite waves the microwave auditory effect only constituting a rapid 10\u22126 \u00b0C rise in temperature, for threshold peaks on each pulse, that, at the least, a strong peak of around 1400\u00a0kW/cm\u00b2 (1.4 billion\u00a0mW/cm\u00b2) would certainly be harmful due to the resulting pressure wave.\nElectronic warfare.\nIn 2003\u20132004, WaveBand Corp. had a contract from the U.S. Navy for the design of an MAE system they called MEDUSA (Mob Excess Deterrent Using Silent Audio) that was intended to temporarily incapacitate personnel through remote application. Reportedly, Sierra Nevada Corp. took over the contract from WaveBand. Experts, such as Kenneth Foster, a University of Pennsylvania bioengineering professor who published research on the microwave auditory effect in 1974, have discounted the effectiveness of the proposed device. Foster said that because of human biophysics, the device \"would kill you well before you were bothered by the noise\". According to former professor at the University of Washington Bill Guy, \"There's a misunderstanding by the public and even some scientists about this auditory effect,\" and \"there couldn't possibly be a hazard from the sound, because the heat would get you first\". \nMicrowave effects have been proposed as the cause of otherwise unexplained illnesses of U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China occurring since 2017 and 2018. However, this explanation has been debated. Bioengineer Kenneth R. Foster noted of the health effects observed in the diplomats, \"it's crazy, but it's sure as heck not microwaves.\" As of October 2021, a microwave cause remains one of the major hypotheses.\nConspiracy theories.\nNumerous individuals suffering from auditory hallucinations, delusional disorders, or other mental illnesses have claimed that government agents use forms of mind control technologies based on microwave signals to transmit sounds and thoughts into their heads as a form of electronic harassment, referring to the alleged technology as \"voice to skull\" or \"V2K\".\nThere are extensive online support networks and numerous websites operated by people fearing mind control. Mental health professionals maintain that many of these websites exhibit evidence of delusional disorders, although they are divided over whether such sites reinforce mental troubles, or act as a form of group social support.\nPsychologists have identified many examples of people reporting 'mind control experiences' (MCEs) on self-published web pages that are \"highly likely to be influenced by delusional beliefs\". Common themes include \"Bad Guys\" using \"psychotronics\" and \"microwaves\", frequent mention of the CIA's MKULTRA project, and frequent citing of Frey's 1962 paper entitled \"Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a painter he worked mainly in watercolour on portraits and animal, landscape, legendary and religious subjects. He was also a wood-engraver and inscription painter. In 1965, Kenneth Clark took him to be the best living British painter, while both T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden put his poetry among the best written in their century. Jones's work gains form from his Christian faith and Welsh heritage.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nJones was born at Arabin Road, Brockley, Kent, now a suburb of South East London, and later lived in nearby Howson Road. His father, James Jones, was born in Flintshire in north Wales, to a Welsh-speaking family, but he was discouraged from speaking Welsh by his father, who believed that habitual use of the language might hold his child back in a career. James Jones moved to London to work as a printer's overseer for the \"Christian Herald\" Press. He met and married Alice Bradshaw, a Londoner, and they had three children: Harold, who died at 21 of tuberculosis, Alice and David.\nJones exhibited artistic promise at an early age, even entering drawings for exhibitions of children's artwork. He wrote that he knew from the age of six he would devote his life to art. He did not read fluently until the age of eight. From the very earliest years of his life he had already come to identify intensely with his paternal heritage: as an old man in 1971, he would write to Saunders Lewis of a 'passionate conviction that I belonged to my father's nation that I certainly felt by the time I was seven'. In 1909, at 14, he entered Camberwell Art School, where he studied under A. S. Hartrick, who had worked with Van Gogh and Gauguin and introduced him to the work of the Impressionists and Pre-Raphaelites. In addition, Jones studied literature, the subject of a mandatory one-hour weekly class at Camberwell.\nWorld War I.\nWith the outbreak of the First World War, Jones enlisted in the London Welsh Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 2 January 1915 and served on the Western Front in 1915\u20131918 with the 38th (Welsh) Division. Jones spent more time on the front line (117 weeks) than any other British writer in the war. He was wounded at Mametz Wood, recuperated in the Midlands, was returned to the Ypres Salient, and joined in the attack on Pilckem Ridge at Passchendaele in 1917. He nearly died of trench fever in 1918, but recovered in England and was stationed in Ireland until the armistice of 11 November 1918. Jones's wartime experience was the basis for his long written work \"In Parenthesis\".\n1920s.\nIn 1919 Jones won a government grant to return at Camberwell Art School. From Camberwell, he followed Walter Bayes to the Westminster School of Art in central London, where he studied under him and with Bernard Meninsky, and was influenced by Walter Sickert, an occasional lecturer there, whom he came to know personally. Jones received instruction towards becoming a Catholic from Fr. John O'Connor, who suggested Jones visit Eric Gill and his guild of Catholic craftsmen at Ditchling in Sussex. Influenced by Gill, Jones entered the Catholic Church in 1921, chiefly, he said, because it seemed \"real\" in contrast to Christian alternatives. He also liked the Church's continuity with Classical antiquity. In 1922 he increasingly spent time at Ditchling, apprenticed as a carpenter but never becoming a full member of Gill's Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic. Having shown himself an incompetent carpenter, Jones turned to wood-engraving, whose rudiments Desmond Chute had taught him. In 1923 Jones worked as an illustrator, for \"The Game\" published by Gill and Hilary Pepler. He also engraved original work for Pepler's St. Dominic's Press, including \"The Rosary Book\". When Gill moved to Capel-y-ffin in the Black Mountains of South Wales in 1923, Jones returned to London, but often visited Gill there and also the Benedictines on Caldey Island, near Tenby.\nJones was among the first modern engravers to combine white-line and black-line engraving. In 1927 he joined the Society of Wood Engravers. He illustrated \"The Book of Jonah\", \"Aesop's Fables.\" and, for the Golden Cockerel Press, \"Gulliver's Travels\" and engraved a large, elaborate frontispiece for a Welsh translation of the Book of Ecclesiastes, \"Llyfr y Pregethwr\". Subsequently Robert Gibbings commissioned him to illustrate, with eight large wood engravings, \"The Chester Play of the Deluge\" (1927), and Douglas Cleverdon commissioned him to illustrate, with eight large copper engravings, Coleridge's poem \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (1929). In 1930 eye-strain forced him to give up engraving.\nIn 1924 Jones had become engaged to marry Gill's daughter Petra, but in 1927 she broke off the engagement to marry a mutual friend. Distressed, Jones concentrated on art. Petra's long neck and high forehead continued as female features in his artwork. He returned to live with his parents at Brockley, also spending time at a house they rented on the coast at Portslade. He painted prolifically and exhibited watercolour seascapes and Welsh landscapes in London galleries. In 1927 Jones made friends with Jim Ede, at the Tate Gallery, who introduced him to art critics and prospective buyers, including Helen Sutherland, who became a patron. Ede introduced him to the painter Ben Nicholson, who in 1928 had Jones elected to the Seven and Five Society, whose other members included Barbara Hepworth, Winifred Nicholson, Cedric Morris, Christopher Wood, and Henry Moore. Jones remained a member until 1935, when he was expelled by Nicholson for not painting abstracts. Disappointed by published accounts of personal combat experience during the war, in 1928 he began writing \"In Parenthesis\", a fictional work based on his own experiences in the trenches. He was now in love with Prudence Pelham, who was its muse.\n1930s.\nFrom 1929 through the mid-1930s, Jones took part in weekly meetings at the Chelsea house of his friend Thomas Ferrier Burns of what has been called the Chelsea Group. It included the cultural historian Christopher Dawson, the philosopher E. I. Watkin, the type-designer Stanley Morison, Harman Grisewood, Bernard Wall, Eric Gill, Martin D'Arcy and others. They discussed a wide range of topics in relation to Catholic Christianity and sought a religious-cultural counterpart to the Unified Field Theory sought by Einstein. To these discussions, Jones contributed his psychological theory of culture, focusing on the balance of utility (efficiency) and gratuity (beauty, truth, goodness) required for healthy civilization. The Chelsea Group would be the matrix of \"The Anathemata\", \"The Tablet\", edited by Tom Burns, and the Third Programme, the BBC's cultural radio station developed and produced by Grisewood.\nJones had long suffered from shell-shock, now known as post-traumatic stress disorder. It contributed to a nervous breakdown in mid-October 1932, precipitated by four months of prolific painting and writing, involving 60 large paintings and the first continuous draft of \"In Parenthesis\". His friends arranged for him to take a therapeutic trip to Jerusalem, which did not alleviate his condition, but influenced his later poetry. His breakdown precluded painting for most of the next 16 years. He was able to work at revising \"In Parenthesis\". As he revised, he read it aloud to close friends, including Jim Ede, who alerted Richard de la Mare at Faber and Faber, to whom Jones agreed to submit it when complete. In 1937 it was published to very positive reviews and in 1938 won the Hawthornden Prize, then the one major British literary award.\nThough Jones was unable to paint, his visual works were shown in Chicago in 1933, at the Venice Biennale in 1934, and at the World's Fair, New York, in 1939. In 1944 an exhibition of his art work toured Britain.\nLater life.\nJones spent most of the Second World War in London, enduring the Blitz. He painted a few important pictures, and to celebrate the wedding of his friend Harman Grisewood to Margaret Bailey, wrote \"Prothalamion\" and \"Epithalamion\", which were eventually published posthumously.\nIn 1947 Jones created, in a single week, ten land-and-skyscapes at Helen Sutherland's house in Cumberland. As in 1932, this burst of activity precipitated a nervous collapse. He underwent psychotherapy at Bowden House in Harrow on the Hill, under the psychologist William ('Bill') Stevenson. Influenced by Freud, Stevenson traced Jones's breakdown to oedipal and sibling tensions, combined with repressed fear during the war, explaining that, if allowed to strengthen, repression in the sexual domain shifted to repression of artistic freedom. He advised Jones to paint and write as essential to his healing. This led Jones throughout the 1950s to make many beautiful painted inscriptions (an art form he invented), along with sometimes numinous still lifes of flowers in glass chalices. He was able to publish in 1952 his epic-length poem \"The Anathemata\".\nIn 1954 an Arts Council tour of his work visited Aberystwyth, Cardiff, Swansea, Edinburgh and the Tate Gallery, London. In 1960, Stevenson began prescribing barbiturates and other harmful drugs that sent Jones's creative life into a virtual standstill for the next 12 years, though he struggled to revise and shape mid-length poems for inclusion in \"The Sleeping Lord\" (1974), a project he managed to complete after the prescriptions were terminated in the summer of 1972. In 1974 Jones was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, an honour restricted to 65 living members (excluding honorary appointments).\nDeath.\nIn 1970 Jones broke the ball of his femur in a fall and thereafter lived in a room at Calvary Nursing Home in Harrow, where he was regularly visited by friends and died in his sleep on 27\u201328 October 1974. He is buried in Ladywell Cemetery within the now renamed twinned London Borough of Lewisham's Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries formerly and respectively 'Deptford Cemetery' and 'Lewisham Cemetery'. In 1985, he was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled at Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.\nArt.\nAlthough Jones began exhibiting paintings in London galleries in 1919, his chief public creative expression was initially engraving. Soon after learning how to engrave, he entered the vanguard of the renewal of wood-engraving as an artform (instead of the reproductive craft it had been through most of the 19th century). He was among the first modern engravers to combine white-line and black-line engraving. His two acknowledged masterpieces of book illustration are \"The Chester Play of the Deluge\" (1927) and \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (1929). In both of these, engravings mirror one another in design and are arranged in the text to form a chiasmic structure. Jones would use this structure to give unifying symbolic form to his epic-length poem, \"The Anathemata\".\nHis meager income came chiefly from painting, which evolved in style throughout his life. Breaking from art-school realism, he adopted the thick-boundary-line and sculptural style of Christian primitivism, which had affinity with the style of the London School. The dramatic landscape of Capel-y-ffin liberated him from fixed, stationary point of view. Having drawn maps during World War I, he reverted to thin-line \"drawing with the point\", which he had learned of from Hartrick. Painting the sea at Caldey Island and Portslade opened him to see water and sky as continuous, an active continuity that came to include the land. The subtleties of his mostly watercolour paintings after 1929 require patient and repeated viewing. In the 7 and 5 Society he was influenced by Winnifred Nicholson in painting freely, relying on more colour, less line, coming close to abstraction. After his first breakdown he painted \"Aphrodite in Aulis\" and two Arthurian paintings that, loaded with symbols, are \"literary\" in requiring \"reading\" as well as viewing. He longed to combine such multi-symbolic work with his earlier stylistic freedom. And he achieved such a combination in his painted inscriptions, which involve mostly ancient texts. In juxtaposing quotations, these inscriptions are modernist in aesthetic. Most are in Latin or Welsh because he wanted them viewed, not read. Saunders Lewis was the first to note that these inscriptions combine Jones's painting with his poetry. Union of symbolism with freedom is also achieved in his still-lifes of flowers in glass chalices. In undergoing so much change, Jones's visual art managed to be alive as only the new can. As a painter, he was, according to Kenneth Clark, \"absolutely unique, a remarkable genius\".\nPoetry.\n\"In Parenthesis\" (1937) is a work of literature based on Jones's first seven months in the trenches culminating in the assault on Mametz Wood during the Battle of the Somme. It is a dense mixture of polyphonic of voices, varying in register, in verse and prose. Although often regarded as a poem, Jones describes \"In Parenthesis\" as a \"writing\". His literary debut, it won high praise from reviewers, many of them former servicemen, for whom its vivid language evoked the realities of trench warfare. They saw its allusions to the horrors of romance and to the battles of history and legend (all seen as defeats) as accurately expressing the feelings of men in combat. The poem draws on literary influences from the 6th-century Welsh epic \"Y Gododdin\" to Shakespeare's \"Henry V\", Thomas Malory's \"Morte d'Arthur\", the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins and \"Anabase\" by Saint-John Perse (translated by Eliot), in an attempt to be true to the experiences of combatants. The cumulative force is emotionally powerful. That and the reader's having got to know the infantrymen involved makes the concluding visitation of the dead by the Queen of the Woods a deeply moving literary experience. On 11 July 1937 when he met Jones, W. B. Yeats elaborately praised \"In Parenthesis\". T. S. Eliot considered it \"a work of genius\". W. H. Auden declared it \"the greatest book about the First World War.\" The war historian Michael Howard called it \"the most remarkable work of literature to emerge from either world war.\" Graham Greene in 1980 thought it \"among the great poems of the century.\" In 1996 the poet and novelist Adam Thorpe said \"it towers above any other prose or verse memorial of ... any war.\" Herbert Read called it \"one of the most remarkable literary achievements of our time.\" It is probably the greatest literary work on war in English.\nAlso epic in length (244 pages with Introduction), \"The Anathemata\" (1952) is Jones's poetic summa, a symbolic dramatic, multi-voiced anatomy of Western culture. Sweeping back and forth through prehistory and historical periods, it focuses thematically on the making of gratuitous signs as an activity essential to humanity, which flourishes during vital culture phases and languishes in predominantly pragmatic periods, such as ours and that of imperial Rome. The poem moves digressively, as interior and dramatic monologues open to include other monologues, forming a chiastic structure of eight concentric circles. The outer circle is formed by the poem beginning with the elevation of the host during the consecration of the Mass and ending 200 pages (6 or 7 seconds) later with the elevation of the chalice. At the centre of the work's chiastic circles is a lyrical celebration of the events contained sacramentally by the Eucharist. Symbolically the structure means that the Eucharist as a super-sign of God's loving union with humanity is contained and sustained by everything in the poem, from Anglo-Saxon cultural genocide to a medieval lavender seller's remembered sexual liaisons. Its chiastic recession of circles makes this the only modernist long poem \"open\" in form that is structurally unified. After reading and rereading it for six months, W. H. Auden called it \"probably the greatest poem of the twentieth century\" and compared it to the inclusive, culturally authoritative long poems of Homer, Virgil, Dante, Chaucer, and Milton. Jones thought it was \"worth 50 'In Parentheses'\" and the most important of any work he had done.\nUntil 1960, Jones worked intermittently on a long poem, of which material in \"The Anathemata\" had initially been meant to form part. Jones used sections of the left-over material mainly in the magazine \"Agenda\" and collected it in \"The Sleeping Lord and Other Fragments\" (1974). A posthumous volume of the unseen material was edited by Harman Grisewood and Ren\u00e9 Hague and published by Agenda Editions as \"The Roman Quarry\". It has since been re-edited by Thomas Goldpaugh and Jamie Callison in \"The Grail Mass\" (Bloomsbury 2018). In these drafts, the monologue material of Judas and Caiaphas has a quality that certainly deserved to be published by Jones in his lifetime.\nIn 2002, three short poems by Jones appeared for the first time in \"Wedding Poems\", edited by Thomas Dilworth. Jones had written two of these, \"Prothalamion\" and \"Epithalamion\", totalling 271 lines, during the Blitz in London. The third, the 24 lines of \"The Brenner\", arose on 18 March 1940 to mark a meeting of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler on the Brenner Pass.\n\"The Sleeping Lord\" (1974) contains one short poem, \"A, a, a, Domine Deus\", a lament for contemporary technological impoverishment), and eight mid-length poems: four of them monologues, or involving monologues, by Roman soldiers stationed in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus's crucifixion. Three others involve Celtic personae. The final mid-length poem is a darkly comical consideration of an assault during the Battle of Passchendaele, in which Western tradition and its values confront mechanized mass suicide. More than any other collection or sequence of poems in English, these works test traditional values in the face of modern mechanized war, technological pragmatism and political totalitarianism. Seamus Heaney thought them \"extraordinary\" writing. The American poet W. S. Merwin called them \"some of Jones's great splendours\". Among them, \"The Hunt\" (beautifully recorded by Jones) and \"The Tutelar of the Place\" are musically especially lyrical \u2013 they ought to be anthologized. These eight mid-length poems \u2013 and first of all these two \u2013 probably make the most welcome start to reading Jones's poetry.\nEssays.\nJones's occasional essays on art, literature, religion and history, introductions to books and talks on the BBC Third Programme have been collected in \"Epoch and Artist\" (Faber, 1959), \"The Dying Gaul\" (Faber, 1978) and \"David Jones on Religion, Politics, and Culture: Unpublished Prose\" (Bloomsbury, 2018). The most important essays include \"Art and Sacrament\", his fullest exposition of his theory of culture; \"Use and Sign\", his most succinct exposition of that theory; \"Introduction to 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'\", intriguing in itself and helpful for appreciating \"The Anathemata\"; and \"The Myth of Arthur\", deepening understanding of \"The Hunt\" and the concluding, eponymous poem in \"The Sleeping Lord\" and, with these two poems, an important contribution to the Matter of Britain'. Harold Rosenberg wrote that Jones's essays on culture \"formulated the axiomatic precondition for understanding contemporary creation.\" Guy Davenport saw in them that Jones \"realized for us the new configuration, which only our time can see, into which culture seems to be shaped, and the historical processes that shaped it.\"\nReputation.\nWith the centenary of the 1914\u20131918 War, Jones gained wider attention through British TV documentaries, notably \"War of Words: Soldier-Poets of the Somme\" on the BBC. Since 2014 Jones has increasingly been seen as an original, major poet and visual artist of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=\"Banks/Hills, p. 164\"&gt;Ariane Banks and Paul Hills: \"The Art of David Jones: Vision and Memory\", Lund Humphries, 2015, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;\nJudging from its rapidly rising prices, Jones's visual art is now fairly well and widely appreciated. Several notable exhibitions of his engravings, paintings and inscriptions, during his life and since, have attested to the popularity of his visual art, most recently \"Vision and Memory\" at the Pallant House Gallery, Chichester. His visual works can now be seen online, in talks on Jones by Dilworth and films directed by Derek Sheil such as \"David Jones Innovation and Consolidation\".\nJones has been less appreciated as a poet, partly because his long, highly allusive poetic works are hard reading for many. Although \"In Parenthesis\" received positive reviews in 1937 and won the Hawthornden Prize in 1938, reader interest was cut short by the Second World War, which eclipsed interest in the earlier war. Until recently, \"In Parenthesis\" and \"The Anathemata\" have been missing from most academic studies of literary modernism. The fault is their publisher, Faber, which from the start failed to list them as poems or Jones as among its poets. (\"The Anathemata\" was strangely listed under Autobiographies and Memoirs.) Not until 1970, after complaints by William Cookson, editor of \"Agenda\", and Stuart Montgomery, editor of The Fulcrum Press, did Faber correct the error, long after the Modernist canon had been established, largely by the American New Critics. Since 1970, academic assessment of Jones's poetry has been catching up with his reputation as a visual artist. But the process was initially stalled by Paul Fussell's judgement against \"In Paraenthesis\" in \"The Great War and Modern Memory\" (Oxford, 1975), as glorifying war by alluding to romance, a judgement that continues to discourage scholarly engagement, even though repeatedly effectively refuted. And the liturgical allusions and eucharistic focus in his later poetry do not appeal to most academics, who are secular-minded. The voices calling attention to his poetry have mainly been those of creative practitioners rather than academics. T. S. Eliot saw Jones as \"of major importance\", \"one of the most distinguished writers of my generation.\" Dylan Thomas said, \"I would like to have done anything as good as David Jones.\" In 1974 Hugh MacDiarmid pronounced Jones \"the greatest native British poet of the century.\" In 1965, Igor Stravinsky thought him \"perhaps the greatest living writer in English\". The art historian Herbert Read called him in 1964 \"one of the greatest writers of our time\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is set in the fictional Surrey village of Highbury and the surrounding estates of Hartfield, Randalls, and Donwell Abbey, and involves the relationships among people from a small number of families. The novel was first published in December 1815, although the title page is dated 1816. As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian\u2013Regency England. \"Emma\" is a comedy of manners.\nBefore she began the novel, Austen wrote, \"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\" In the first sentence, she introduces the title character by stating \"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and a happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\" Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.\n\"Emma\", written after Austen's move to Chawton, was her last novel to be published during her lifetime, while \"Persuasion\", the last complete novel Austen wrote, was published posthumously.\nThe novel has been adapted for a number of films, television programmes, and stage plays.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot summary.\nEmma Woodhouse's friend and former governess, Miss Taylor, has just married Mr Weston. Having introduced them, Emma takes credit for their marriage and decides that she likes matchmaking. After returning home to Hartfield, Emma forges ahead with her new interest against the advice of her friend Mr Knightley, whose brother is married to Emma's elder sister, Isabella. She attempts to match her new friend, Harriet Smith, to Mr Elton, the vicar of Highbury. Emma persuades Harriet to refuse a marriage proposal from Robert Martin, a respectable young farmer, although Harriet likes him. Mr Elton, a social climber, mistakenly believes Emma is in love with him and proposes to her. When Emma reveals she believed him attached to Harriet, he is outraged, considering Harriet socially inferior. After Emma rejects him, Mr Elton goes to Bath and returns with a pretentious, \"nouveau-riche\" wife, as Mr Knightley expected he would do. Harriet is heartbroken, and Emma feels ashamed about misleading her.\nFrank Churchill, Mr Weston's son, arrives for a two-week visit. Frank had been adopted as a boy by his wealthy and domineering aunt (who is now in poor health) and has had few recent opportunities to visit. Mr Knightley tells Emma that, while Frank is intelligent and engaging, he has a shallow character. Jane Fairfax also arrives to visit her aunt, Miss Bates, and grandmother, Mrs Bates, for a few months; intending then to find a governess position, as she is now twenty-one and determined to support herself. She is the same age as Emma and has received an excellent education through her father's friend, Colonel Campbell, but intends not to depend on the Campbell's good nature indefinitely. Emma has remained somewhat aloof from Jane because she envies her and is annoyed by everyone, including Mrs Weston and Mr Knightley, praising Jane. Mrs Elton seeks to take Jane under her wing; announcing - before it is wanted - that she will find her a governess post.\nEmma decides that Jane and Mr Dixon, Colonel Campbell's new son-in-law, are mutually attracted, and that is the reason she arrived earlier than expected. She confides this to Frank, who met Jane and the Campbells at Weymouth the previous year; he apparently agrees with Emma. Suspicions are further fuelled when a gifted piano, sent anonymously, arrives for Jane. Emma feels herself falling in love with Frank, but it does not last. The Eltons treat Harriet poorly, culminating in Mr Elton publicly snubbing Harriet at a ball. Mr Knightley, who normally refrained from dancing, gallantly asks Harriet to dance. The day after the ball, Frank brings Harriet to Hartfield, as she fainted after a rough encounter with local gypsies. Emma mistakes Harriet's gratitude to Frank as Harriet being in love with him. Meanwhile, Mrs Weston wonders if Mr Knightley is attracted to Jane, but Emma dismisses the idea. When Mr Knightley says he notices a connection between Jane and Frank, Emma disagrees, as Frank appears to be courting her instead. Frank arrives late to a gathering at Donwell, while Jane departs early. The next day at Box Hill, a local scenic spot, Frank and Emma are joking when Emma thoughtlessly mocks Miss Bates's loquaciousness.\nWhen Mr Knightley scolds Emma for making fun of Miss Bates, she is ashamed. The next day, she visits Miss Bates to atone for her bad behaviour, impressing Mr Knightley. During the visit, Emma learns that Jane has accepted a governess position from one of Mrs Elton's friends. Jane becomes ill and refuses to see Emma or receive her gifts. Meanwhile, Frank has been visiting his aunt, who dies soon after his arrival. He and Jane reveal to the Westons that they have been secretly engaged since autumn, but Frank knew his aunt would disapprove of the match. Maintaining the secrecy strained the conscientious Jane and caused the couple to quarrel, with Jane ending the engagement. Frank's easy-going uncle readily gives his blessing to the match. The engagement is made public, leaving Emma annoyed to discover that she had been so wrong.\nEmma believes Frank's engagement will devastate Harriet, but instead, Harriet says she loves Mr Knightley, and though she knows the match is too unequal, Emma's encouragement and Mr Knightley's kindness have given her hope. Emma is startled and realises that she is also in love with Mr Knightley. Mr Knightley returns to console Emma about Frank and Jane's engagement, thinking her heartbroken. When she admits her foolishness, he proposes, and she accepts. Harriet accepts Robert Martin's second proposal, and they are the first couple to marry. Jane and Emma reconcile, and Frank and Jane visit the Westons. Once the mourning period for Frank's aunt ends, they will marry. Before the end of November, Emma and Mr Knightley are married with the prospect of \"perfect happiness.\" They will live at Hartfield with Mr Woodhouse.\nPrincipal characters.\nEmma Woodhouse, the protagonist of the story, is a beautiful, high-spirited, intelligent, and somewhat spoiled young woman from the landed gentry. She is nearly twenty-one when the story opens. Her mother died when she was young. She has been mistress of the house (Hartfield) since her elder sister got married. Although intelligent, she lacks the discipline to practise or study anything in depth. She is portrayed as compassionate to the poor, but at the same time has a strong sense of class status. Her affection for and patience towards her valetudinarian father are also noteworthy. While she is in many ways mature, Emma makes some serious mistakes, mainly due to her lack of experience and her conviction that she is always right. Although she has vowed she will never marry, she delights in making matches for others. She has a brief flirtation with Frank Churchill; however, she realises by the end of the novel that she loves Mr Knightley.\nMr Knightley, aged 37 years, is Emma's neighbour and close friend. He is her only critic. Mr Knightley owns Donwell Abbey, which includes extensive grounds and farms. He is the elder brother of Mr John Knightley, the husband of Emma's elder sister Isabella. Mr Knightly is considerate, hardworking, aware of the feelings of the other characters, and always exhibits good behaviour and judgment; but is a very busy man. Mr Knightley is angry after Emma persuades Harriet to turn down Mr Martin, a farmer on the Donwell estate; he warns Emma against pushing Harriet towards Mr Elton, knowing that Mr Elton seeks to marry for money. He is suspicious of Frank Churchill and his motives; he suspects that Frank has a secret understanding with Jane Fairfax. Mr Knightly is the local magistrate and is the leading figure of the parish select vestry which meets regularly at the Crown Inn, and which is in all practical respects, the governing authority of Highbury; having statutory responsibility for the collection of rates, the registration of births, marriages and deaths, the upkeep of the church, school, roads and bridges, the appointment of the parish constable and overseer of the poor, the employment of the parish schoolteacher, and the operation of the House of Correction and Poorhouse. \nFrank Churchill, Mr Weston's son by his first marriage, is an amiable young man, who, at age 23, is liked by almost everyone. Mr Knightley, however, thinks him immature and selfish for failing to visit his father after his father's wedding. After his mother's death, he was raised by his wealthy aunt and uncle, the Churchills, at the family estate of Enscombe in Yorkshire. To please his aunt he assumed the name Churchill on his majority, so that he might inherit her estate in that name; but while she still lives - and she is in poor health - he remains entirely dependent on her continued approval to maintain his expectations. Frank is given to dancing and living a carefree existence, and became secretly engaged to Miss Fairfax at Weymouth, although he fears his aunt will forbid the match because Jane is not wealthy. He manipulates and plays games with the other characters to ensure his engagement to Jane remains concealed.\nJane Fairfax is an orphan whose only family is her aunt, Miss Bates, and her grandmother, Mrs Bates; and the three of them together now share genteel poverty. She is a beautiful, resourceful, bright, and elegant woman, with impeccable manners and strong moral compass. The same age as Emma, she is well-educated and talented at singing and playing the piano; and is the only person whom Emma envies; indeed in any other Jane Austen novel, she - not Emma - would be the female protagonist. Colonel Campbell, an army friend of Jane's father, had felt responsible for Jane, and provided her an excellent education while she had shared his home and family from age nine; but she has now determined to support herself. Her only realistic option is to become a governess \u2013 an unpleasant prospect, but for unmarried girls of good family and education but no fortune, there was little other choice. Her secret engagement with Frank Churchill goes against her principles and distresses her greatly.\nHarriet Smith, a young friend of Emma, just seventeen when the story opens, is a beautiful but unsophisticated girl. She has been a pupil at a nearby school, where she met the sisters of Mr Martin. As a parlour boarder at the school she now helps supervise younger pupils. Emma takes Harriet under her wing early on, and she becomes the subject of Emma's misguided matchmaking attempts. She is revealed in the last chapter to be the natural daughter of a decent tradesman, although he is not a gentleman. Harriet and Mr Martin are wed. The now wiser Emma approves of the match.\nRobert Martin is a well-to-do, 24-year-old tenant farmer who, though not a gentleman, is a friendly, amiable and diligent young man, well esteemed by Mr George Knightley. He becomes acquainted and subsequently smitten with Harriet during her two-month stay at Abbey Mill Farm, which was arranged at the invitation of his sister, Elizabeth Martin, Harriet's school friend. His first marriage proposal, in a letter, is rejected by Harriet under Emma's direction and influence (an incident which puts Mr Knightley and Emma in a disagreement with one another). Emma had convinced herself that Harriet's class and breeding were above associating with the Martins, much less marrying one. His second marriage proposal is later accepted by a contented Harriet and approved by a wiser Emma; their joining marks the first of the three happy couples to marry in the end.\nReverend Philip Elton is a good-looking, initially well-mannered, and ambitious young vicar, 27 years old and unmarried when the story opens. He is respectable and conscientious in his religious duties and care for his parishioners, and in his responsibilities in the administration and governance of the parish. He is well aware of his good looks and status, and it is only when he is around other men that he shows his true colours and reveals his intention to marry a wife with a significant private income. Emma wants him to marry Harriet; however, he aspires to secure Emma's hand in marriage to gain her dowry of \u00a330,000. Mr Elton displays his mercenary nature by quickly marrying another woman of means after Emma rejects him.\nAugusta Elton, formerly Miss Hawkins, is Mr Elton's wife. She has 10,000 pounds \"or thereabouts\" (the vague description of her dowry perhaps suggests she is not as wealthy as she claims), but lacks good manners, committing common vulgarities such as using people's names too intimately (as in \"Jane\", not \"Miss Fairfax\"; \"Knightley\", not \"Mr Knightley\"). She is a boasting, pretentious woman who expects her due as a new bride in the village. Emma is polite to her but does not like her and the two instantly become passive-aggressive enemies. She patronises Jane, which earns Jane the sympathy of others. Her lack of social graces shows the good breeding of the other characters, particularly Miss Fairfax and Mrs Weston, and shows the difference between gentility and money. Mrs Elton repeatedly makes contradictory and unbelievable declarations about her background, such as exaggerated claims of the similarity between Emma's estate, Hartfield, and her brother-in-law's manor, Maple Grove, revealing her dishonesty and enforcing the idea that she is a scheming parvenu trying her utmost to conceal her lower origins.\nMrs Weston was Emma's governess for sixteen years as Miss Anne Taylor and remains her closest friend and confidante after she marries Mr Weston. She is a sensible woman who loves Emma. Mrs Weston acts as a surrogate mother to her former charge and, occasionally, as a voice of moderation and reason. The Weston and the Woodhouse families see each other almost daily. Near the end of the story, the Westons' baby Anna is born.\nMr Weston is a widower and a businessman living in Highbury who marries Miss Taylor in his early 40s, after buying a house called Randalls. By his first marriage, he is father to Frank Weston Churchill, who was adopted and raised by his late wife's brother and his wife. He sees his son in London each year. He married his first wife, Miss Churchill, when he was a captain in the militia, posted near her home. Mr Weston is a sanguine, optimistic man, who enjoys socialising, making friends quickly in business and among his neighbours.\nMiss Bates is a friendly, garrulous spinster whose mother, Mrs Bates, is a friend of Mr Woodhouse. Her niece is Jane Fairfax, daughter of her late sister. She was raised in better circumstances in her younger days as the vicar's daughter; now she and her mother rent rooms in Highbury. One day, Emma humiliates her on a day out in the country, when she alludes to her tiresome prolixity.\nMr Henry Woodhouse, Emma's father, is always concerned for his health, and to the extent that it does not interfere with his own, the health and comfort of his friends. He is a valetudinarian (i.e., similar to a hypochondriac but more likely to be genuinely ill). He assumes that a great many things are hazardous to his health, especially draughts of wind. Emma gets along with him well, and he loves both his daughters. He laments that \"poor Isabella\" and especially \"poor Miss Taylor\" have married and live away from him. He is a fond father and fond grandfather who did not remarry when his wife died; instead he brought in Miss Taylor to educate his daughters and become part of the family. Because he is generous and well-mannered, his neighbours accommodate him when they can. Although his Hartfield estate is relatively modest, Mr Woodhouse owns substantial other property which provides him with an income scarcely less than that of Mr Knightly at Donwell Abbey, but he does not play any part in the public goveranance of the village. \nIsabella Knightley (n\u00e9e Woodhouse) is the elder sister of Emma, by seven years, and daughter of Henry. She is married to John Knightley. She lives in London with her husband and their five children (Henry, 'little' John, Bella, 'little' Emma, and George). She is similar in disposition to her father, and her relationship to Mr Wingfield, (her family's physician) mirrors that of her father's to Mr Perry.\nJohn Knightley is Isabella's husband and George's younger brother, 31 years old. He is a lawyer (either a barrister or solicitor) by profession. Like the others raised in the area, he is a friend of Jane Fairfax. He greatly enjoys the company of his family, including his brother and his Woodhouse in-laws, but is not a very sociable man. He is forthright with Emma, his sister-in-law.\nMinor characters.\nMr Perry is the apothecary in Highbury. He is never shown directly speaking but spends a significant amount of time responding to the health issues of Mr Woodhouse. He and Mrs Perry have several children. He is also the subject of a discussion between Miss Bates and Jane Fairfax that is relayed in a letter to Mr Frank Churchill which he inadvertently discloses to Emma, thus risking discovery of his link with Jane Fairfax. He is described as an \"... intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr Woodhouse's life.\"\nMrs Bates is the widow of the former vicar of Highbury, the mother of Miss Bates and the grandmother of Jane Fairfax. She is old and hard of hearing, but is a frequent companion to Mr Woodhouse when Emma attends social activities without him.\nMr &amp; Mrs Cole have been residents of Highbury for several years, but have recently benefited from a significant increase in their income that has allowed them to expand the size of their house, number of servants and other expenses. Despite their \"low origin\" in trade, their income and style of living have made them the second most prominent family in Highbury, next to the Woodhouses at Hartfield. They host a dinner party that is a significant plot element.\nMrs Churchill was the wife of the brother of Mr Weston's first wife. She and her husband, Mr Churchill, live at Enscombe in Yorkshire and raised Mr Weston's son, Mr Frank Churchill after the death of Frank's mother. Although never seen directly, she makes demands on Frank Churchill's time and attention that prevent him from visiting his father. Her potential disapproval is the reason that the engagement between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax is kept secret. Her death provides the opportunity for the secret to be revealed.\nColonel and Mrs Campbell were friends of Jane Fairfax's late father. Since Jane was their guest for extended visits, they took over her education in preparation for her working as a governess when she grew up. They provided her every advantage possible, short of adoption, and were very fond of her.\nMrs Goddard is the mistress of a boarding school for girls in which Harriet Smith is one of the pupils. She is also a frequent companion to Mr Woodhouse along with Mrs Bates.\nMr William Larkins is an employee on the Donwell Abbey estate of Mr Knightley. He frequently visits the Bateses, bringing them gifts, such as apples, from Mr Knightley.\nPublication history.\n\"Emma\" was written after the publication of \"Pride and Prejudice\" and was submitted to the London publisher John Murray II in the autumn of 1815. He offered Austen \u00a3450 for this plus the copyrights of \"Mansfield Park\" and \"Sense and Sensibility\", which she refused. Instead, she published two thousand copies of the novel at her own expense, retaining the copyright and paying a 10% commission to Murray. The publication in December 1815 (dated 1816) consisted of a three-volume set in duodecimo at the selling price of \u00a31.1s (one guinea) per set.\nPrior to publication, Austen's novels had come to the attention of the Prince Regent, whose librarian at Carlton House, James Stanier Clarke, showed her around the Library at the Prince Regent's request, and who suggested a dedication to the Prince Regent in a future publication. This resulted in a dedication of \"Emma\" to the Prince Regent at the time of publication and a dedication copy of the novel sent to Carlton House in December 1815.\nIn America, copies of this first publication were sold in 1818 for $4 per copy, as well as an American edition published by Mathew Carey of Philadelphia in 1816. The number of copies of this edition are not known. A later American edition was published in 1833 and again in 1838 by Carey, Lea, and Blanchard. A French version was published in 1816 by Arthus Bertrand, publisher for Madame Isabelle De Montolieu. A second French version for the Austrian market was published in 1817 Viennese publisher Schrambl.\nRichard Bentley reissued \"Emma\" in 1833, along with Austen's five other novels, in his series of Standard Novels. This issue did not contain the dedication page to the Prince Regent. These editions were frequently reprinted up until 1882 with the final publication of the Steventon Edition. \"Emma\" has remained in continuous publication in English throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In addition to the French translation already mentioned, \"Emma\" was translated into Swedish and German in the nineteenth century and into fifteen other languages in the twentieth century including Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German and Italian.\nReception.\nPrior to publishing, John Murray's reader, William Gifford, who was also the editor of the \"Quarterly Review\", said of the novel that \"Of \"Emma\" I have nothing but good to say. I was sure of the writer before you mentioned her. The MS though plainly written has yet some, indeed many little omissions, and an expression may now and then be amended in passing through the press. I will readily undertake the revision.\" Early reviews of \"Emma\" were generally favourable, and were more numerous than those of any other of Austen's novels. One important review, requested by John Murray prior to publication and written by Sir Walter Scott, appeared anonymously in March 1816 in the \"Quarterly Review\", although the date of the journal was October 1815. He writes:The author is already known to the public by the two novels announced in her title page, and both, the last especially, attracted, with justice, an attention from the public far superior to what is granted to the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering-places and circulating libraries. They belong to a class of fictions which has arisen almost in our own times, and which draws the characters and incidents introduced more immediately from the current of ordinary life than was permitted by the former rules of the novel...\"Emma\" has even less story than either of the preceding novels ... The author's knowledge of the world, and the peculiar tact with which she presents characters that the reader cannot fail to recognize, reminds us something of the merits of the Flemish school of painting. The subjects are not often elegant, and certainly never grand: but they are finished up to nature, and with a precision which delights the reader.Two other unsigned reviews appeared in 1816, one in \"The Champion\", also in March, and another in September of the same year in \"Gentleman's Magazine.\" Other commenters include Thomas Moore, the Irish poet, singer and entertainer who was a contemporary of Austen's; he wrote to Samuel Rogers, an English poet, in 1816:Let me entreat you to read \"Emma\" \u2013 it is the very perfection of novel-writing \u2013 and I cannot praise it more highly than by saying it is often extremely like your own method of describing things \u2013 so much effect with so little effort!\nA contemporary Scottish novelist, Susan Edmonstone Ferrier, wrote to a friend, also in 1816:I have been reading \"Emma\", which is excellent; there is no story whatever, and the heroine is not better than other people; but the characters are all true to life and the style so piquant, that it does not require the adventitious aids of mystery and adventure.\nThere was some criticism about the lack of story. John Murray remarked that it lacked \"incident and Romance\"; Maria Edgeworth, the author of \"Belinda\", to whom Austen had sent a complimentary copy, wrote:there was no story in it, except that Miss Emma found that the man whom she designed for Harriet's lover was an admirer of her own \u2013 &amp; he was affronted at being refused by Emma &amp; Harriet wore the willow \u2013 and \"smooth, thin water-gruel\" is according to Emma's father's opinion a very good thing &amp; it is very difficult to make a cook understand what you mean by \"smooth, thin water-gruel\"!!\nAusten also collected comments from friends and family on their opinions of \"Emma\". Writing several years later, John Henry Newman observed in a letter about the novel:Everything Miss Austen writes is clever, but I desiderate something. There is a want of body to the story. The action is frittered away in over-little things. There are some beautiful things in it. Emma herself is the most interesting to me of all her heroines. I feel kind to her whenever I think of her ... That other woman, Fairfax, is a dolt \u2013 but I like Emma.\nLater reviewers or commenters on the novel include Charlotte Bront\u00eb, George Henry Lewes, Juliet Pollock, Anne Ritchie, Henry James, Reginald Farrer, Virginia Woolf and E. M. Forster. Other reviewers include Thomas Babington Macaulay who considered Austen to be a \"Prose Shakespeare\", and Margaret Oliphant who stated in \"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\" in March that she prefers \"Emma\" to Austen's other works and that it is \"the work of her mature mind\". Although Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\" is the most popular of her novels, Robert McCrum suggests that \"Emma\" \"is her masterpiece, mixing the sparkle of her early books with a deep sensibility\". Academic John Mullan argued that \"Emma\" was a revolutionary novel which changed the shape of what is possible in fiction\" because it \"bent narration through the distorting lens of its protagonist's mind\".\nThemes.\nHighbury as a character.\nThe British critic Robert Irvine wrote that unlike the situation in Austen's previous novels, the town of Highbury in Surrey emerges as a character in its own right. Irvine wrote that: \"In \"Emma\", we find something much closer to a genuinely communal voice, a point of view at work in the narrative that cannot be reduced to the subjectivity of any one character. This point of view appears both as something perceived by Emma, an external perspective on events and characters that the reader encounters as and when Emma recognises it; and as an independent discourse appearing in the text alongside the discourse of the narrator and characters\". Irvine used as an example the following passage: \"The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of as many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had not thrown himself away\u2014he had gained a woman of \u00a310,000 or thereabouts; and he had gained with delightful rapidity\u2014the first hour of introduction he had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious\". Irvine points out the adjective \"charming\" appears to the narrator speaking, but notes the sentence goes on to associate \"perfect\" with \"usual\", which he pointed out was an incongruity. Irvine suggested the next sentence \"would always be called ten\" is in fact the voice of the community of Highbury, which wants the fianc\u00e9e of Mr Elton to be \"perfect\", whom the narrator sarcastically calls the \"usual\" sort of community gossip is about a new arrival in Highbury, whom everyone thinks is \"charming\". Since the character of Mrs Elton is in fact far from \"charming\", the use of the term \"charming\" to describe her is either the gossip of Highbury and/or the narrator being sarcastic.\nLikewise, the Australian scholar John Wiltshire wrote that one of Austen's achievements was to \"give depth\" to the \"Highbury world\". Wiltshire noted that Austen put the population of Highbury as 352 people, and said that although clearly most of these people do not appear as characters - or at best as minor characters - Austen created the impression of Highbury as a \"social commonwealth\". Wiltshire used as an example of Mr Perry, the town apothecary who is frequently mentioned in the town gossip, but never appears in the book, having a \"kind of familiarity by proxy\". Wiltshire also notes the scene where Emma and Harriet visit a poor cottage on the outskirts of Highbury; during their walk, it is made clear from Emma's remarks that this part of Highbury is not her Highbury.\nThe character of Frank is a member of the \"discursive community\" of Highbury long before he actually appears, as his father tells everyone in Highbury about him. Emma forms her judgement of Frank based on what she hears about him in Highbury before she meets him. Irvine wrote that Austen's use of three different voices in \"Emma\"\u2014the voice of Highbury, the narrator's voice, and Emma's voice, can at times make it very confusing to the reader about just who is actually speaking. However, Irvine wrote that one accepts that the voice of Highbury is often speaking, then much of the book makes sense, as Emma believes she has a power that she does not, to make Frank either love or not via her interest or indifference, which is explained as the result of the gossip of Highbury, which attributes Emma this power.\nThis is especially the case as Emma is born into the elite of Highbury, which is portrayed as a female-dominated world. Irvine wrote that Elizabeth Bennet in \"Pride and Prejudice\" and Fanny Price in \"Mansfield Park\" enjoy the moral authority of being good women, but must marry a well-off man to have the necessary social influence to fully use this moral authority whereas Emma is born with this authority. Emma herself acknowledges this when she says to Harriet that she possesses: \"none of the usual inducements to marry... Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want.\" However, political power still resides with men in the patriarchal society of Regency England, as the book notes that Mr Knightley is not only a member of the gentry, but also serves as the magistrate of Highbury. Emma clashes with Knightley at the beginning of the novel over the all-important \"distinctions of rank\", namely does Harriet Smith belong with the yeoman class together with Robert Martin, or the gentry class that Emma and Knightley are both part of. Knightley declares his respect for both Smith and Martin, but argues that as part of the yeomen class, neither belongs with the gentry, while Emma insists on including her best friend/proteg\u00e9e in with the gentry. In Regency England and in \"Emma\", the term friendship describes a power relationship where one higher party can do favours for the lower party while the term \"claim intimacy\" is a relationship of equals. Mrs Elton has \"friendship\" with Jane Fairfax while she \"claims intimacy\" with Mr Knightley. The use of these terms \"friendship\" and \"claim intimacy\" refers to the question of who belongs to the local elite. Neither Emma nor Mr Knightley question the right of the elite to dominate society, but rather their power struggle is over who belongs to the elite, and who has the authority to make the decision about whom to include and whom to exclude, which shows that in a certain sense that Emma is just as powerful socially as is Mr Knightley. Further complicating this power struggle is the arrival of Mrs Elton, who attempts to elevate Jane Fairfax into the elite. This is cruel as Jane is not rich enough to properly belong to the elite, and Mrs Elton is showing Jane a world to which she can never really belong, no matter how many parties and balls she attends. In addition to her annoyance at Mrs Elton's relationship with Jane, Emma finds Mrs Elton an \"upstart\", \"under-bred\" and \"vulgar\", which adds venom to the dispute between the two women. Mrs Elton is only a first generation gentry, as her father bought the land that she grew up on with money he had raised in trade. Her snobbery is therefore that of a \"nouveau riche\", desperately insecure about her status. When Mrs Elton boasted that her family had owned their estate for a number of years, Emma responds that a true English gentry family would count ownership of their estate in generations, not years.\nOf Emma's two rivals for social authority, one shares a common class while the other a common sex. The marriage of Emma to Mr Knightley consolidates her social authority by linking herself to the dominant male of Highbury and pushes Mrs Elton's claims aside. Irvine wrote: \"On this view, and in contrast to Austen's two previous novels, \"Emma\" works to legitimate established gentry power \"defined in opposition to\" an autonomous feminine authority over the regulation of social relations, and not through the vindication of such autonomous authority.\" However, as the novel goes, such a reading is countered by the way that Emma begins to take in the previously excluded into the realm of the elite, such as visiting the poor Miss Bates and her mother, and the Coles, whose wealth stems from trade. Likewise, Jane Fairfax, who is too poor to live off her wealth and must work as a governess, which excludes her from the female social elite of Highbury, does marry well after all, which makes her story the only one of real feminine worth triumphing over the lack of wealth in \"Emma\".\nGender reversal.\nThere are numerous parallels between the main characters and plots of \"Pride and Prejudice\" and \"Emma\": Both novels feature a proud central character, respectively, Darcy and Emma; a critical future spouse, Elizabeth and Mr Knightley; an easily swayed friend, Bingley and Harriet; an almost-thwarted marital ambition, Jane and Martin; a dependent relative, Georgiana and Mr Woodhouse; and a potential object of matrimony who is a wrong choice for the central character, Anne de Bourgh and Frank Churchill. These pairs suggest that \"Emma\" may have been a gendered reversal of the earlier novel. Such reversals were familiar to Austen through the works of favoured authors like Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding and William Shakespeare.\nAusten is thought to have switched gender in some of her earlier work as well. Her cousin Eliza Hancock may have been her inspiration for the character Edward Stanley in \"Catharine, or the Bower\", one of her youthful pieces, showing her the \"trick of changing the gender of her prototype.\" In \"Pride and Prejudice\", Thomas Lefroy, a charming and witty Irishman, may have been the basis for Elizabeth's personality, while Austen may have used herself as the model for Darcy's reserve and self-consciousness when among company, but open and loving demeanor when among close friends and family. Austen's selection of \"Pride and Prejudice\" as the basis for reversing gender in \"Emma\" may have been motivated by these earlier experiences and insights.\nReversing the genders of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in \"Emma\" allowed Austen to disturb paradigms and examine the different expectations society had of men and women; the elements she chose to include in \"Emma\" and how she chose to revise them yield a powerful but ultimately conventional commentary on the status of women. The novel's central concern with gender is often noted in the literature as themes like gendered space, romance, female empowerment, wealth, parenting, and masculinity.\nGendered space.\nWiltshire wrote about Austen's use of \"gendered space\" in \"Emma\", noting the female characters have a disproportionate number of scenes in the drawing rooms of Highbury while the male characters often have scenes outdoors. Wiltshire noted that Jane Fairfax cannot walk to the post office in the rain to pick up the mail without becoming the object of village gossip while Mr Knightley can ride all the way to London without attracting any gossip. Wiltshire described the world that the women of Highbury live in as a sort of prison, writing that in the novel \"... women's imprisonment is associated with deprivation, with energies and powers perverted in their application, and events, balls and outings are linked with the arousal and satisfaction of desire\".\nIn addition to Wiltshire\u2019s observations, critics have noted that Austen\u2019s depiction of gendered spaces in Emma reflects the limited public agency available to women of her class. Claudia L. Johnson has argued that Emma\u2019s frequent presence in drawing rooms and parlors highlights how Regency\u2011era women\u2019s influence was largely confined to domestic and semi\u2011domestic spheres, while men like Mr Knightley navigate both private and public arenas without scrutiny. These spatial divisions are not merely settings but serve as symbolic boundaries that shape each character\u2019s opportunities and constraints. For instance, Emma\u2019s attempts at matchmaking and social maneuvering take place almost entirely within these indoor, community\u2011oriented spaces, reinforcing the notion that her power is relational rather than institutional. Scholars have suggested that Austen uses these contrasts between interior and exterior spaces to critique the rigid social structures of her time and to highlight the subtle forms of influence women could exert within the limitations imposed on them.\nNationhood and the \"Irish Question\".\nThe novel is set in England, but there are several references to Ireland, which were related to the ongoing national debate about the \"Irish Question\". In 1801, the Act of Union had brought Ireland into the United Kingdom, but there was a major debate about what was Ireland's precise status in the United Kingdom; another kingdom, province, or a colony? Austen satirizes this debate by having Miss Bates talk about Mrs Dixon's new house in Ireland, a place that she cannot decide is a kingdom, a country, or a province, but is merely very \"strange\" whatever its status may be. Austen also satirized the vogue for \"Irish tales\" that became popular after the Act of Union as English writers started to produce picturesque, romantic stories set in Ireland to familiarize the English people with the newest addition to the United Kingdom. The travel itinerary that Miss Bates sketches out for the Campbells' visit to Ireland is satire of a typical \"Irish tale\" novel, which was Austen's way of mocking those who had a superficial appreciation of Irish culture by buying the \"Irish tales\" books that presented Ireland in a very stereotypical way. Austen further alludes to the Society of United Irishmen uprising in 1798 by having the other characters worry about what might happen to the Dixons when they visit a place in the Irish countryside called \"Baly-craig\", which appears to be Ballycraig in County Antrim in what is now Northern Ireland, which had been the scene of much bloody fighting between the United Irishmen Society and the Crown in 1798, an enduring testament to Ireland's unsettled status with much of the Irish population not accepting British rule. The American scholar Colleen Taylor wrote about Austen's treatment of the \"Irish Question\": \"That Emma applies a distant and fictionalized Irish space to her very limited and dissimilar English circle, turning a somewhat ordinary English young woman, Jane Fairfax, into an Irish scandal, proves that the object of English humor is\u2014for once\u2014not the stage Irishman but the privileged English woman who presumes to know what he and his culture are really like.\"\nRomance.\nIn contrast to other Austen heroines, Emma seems immune to romantic attraction, at least until her final self-revelation concerning her true affections. Unlike Marianne Dashwood, who is attracted to the wrong man before she settles on the right one, Emma generally shows no romantic interest in the men she meets and even her flirting with Churchill seems tame. She is genuinely surprised (and somewhat disgusted) when Mr Elton declares his love for her, much in the way Elizabeth Bennet reacts to the obsequious Mr Collins, also a parson. Her fancy for Frank Churchill represents more of a longing for a little drama in her life than a longing for romantic love. For example, at the beginning of Chapter XIII, Emma has \"no doubt of her being in love\", but it quickly becomes clear that, even though she spends time \"forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment\", we are told that \"the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she \"refused him\"\".\nIt is only Mr Knightley who can willingly share the burden of Emma's father, as well as providing her with guidance, love and companionship. He has been in love with her since she was 13 years old, but neither he nor she have realized that there is a natural bond between them. He declares his love for her: \"What did she say? Just what she ought, of course. A lady always does.\"\nFemale empowerment.\nIn \"Emma\", Emma Woodhouse serves as a direct reflection of Jane Austen's feminist characterization of female heroines, in terms of both female individuality and independence (romantically, financially, etc.). In terms of romantic independence, Emma's father, Henry Woodhouse, very consistently preaches against the idea of marriage. He plays an integral role in Emma's own initial perception of matrimony, leading her to make use of her free time by becoming the town \"matchmaker\", which leaves her happily single and unwed for the majority of the novel. One of the predominant reasons Emma is able to live a comfortable and independent lifestyle is her gifted inheritance\u2014given to her by a past family member\u2014which allows her to depend on no one other than herself for a sustainable, wealthy, and self-sufficient life although she currently lives in her father's house. Austen portrays Emma as educated and capable, and extremely popular and well-liked in her hometown of Highbury.\nLiterary scholar Laurence Mazzeno addresses Austen's narrative in regard to female individualism and empowerment, stating, \"\u2026 Austen deals honestly and with skill in treating relationships between men and women, and presents women of real passion \u2013 but not the flamboyant, sentimental kind that populate conventional romances ... Austen is not 'narrow' in her treatment of character, either; her men and women furnish as broad a view of humanity as would be obtained by traveling up and down the world ... Austen was conservative in both her art and her politics \u2013 suggesting that, even from a woman's point of view, Austen was hardly out to subvert the status quo.\"\nIn the Bedford Edition of \"Emma\" edited by Alistair M. Duckworth, there are five essays to accompany the text that discuss contemporary critical perspectives, one of which is about feminist criticism. The feminist criticism essay was written by Devoney Looser. In her essay, she asks the question whether Jane Austen was a feminist. She also states in her essay that one's answer to the question not only depends on how one understands Austen's novels, but also how one defines feminism.\nLooser states that if you define feminism broadly as a movement relating to how women are limited and devalued within a culture then Austen's work applies to this concept of feminism. She states that if you define feminism as a movement to eradicate gender, race, class, and sexual prejudice and to agitate for change, then Austen's work does not really apply to this concept of feminism.\nWealth.\nEmma is a wealthy young woman, having a personal fortune amounting to \u00a330,000. This would be sufficient for her to live independently in the same style as she is accustomed to. As she herself points out, this means that there is no financial pressure on her to marry. This is in sharp contrast to the heroines of Austen's other novels, who all lack sufficient resources to maintain as single women the lifestyle in which they have been raised by their families. This means that Emma has greater freedom of choice and behaviour, in some ways closer to that exercised by wealthy men of the time.\nParenting.\nMr Woodhouse adopted a laissez-faire parenting style when it came to raising Emma. In fact, most of the time it seems that Emma is parenting her father, taking on the role of both daughter and mother. Emma feels entirely responsible for the wellbeing of her father and therefore feels obliged to stay with him. Her father is a selfish but gentle man and does not approve of matrimony. If Emma were to marry he would lose his primary carer. This is not to say that Emma feels restrained by her father, in fact quite the opposite, Emma has the power over the world she inhabits. The narrator announces at the start of the novel: \"The real evils of Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much of her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments\" (Austen, 1). Although Mr Woodhouse is lacking as a father figure, Mr Knightley acts as a surrogate father to Emma. Mr Knightley is not afraid to correct Emma's behaviour and tell her what she needs to hear. Mr Knightley reprimands Emma when he learns of her match-making and also later when Emma is extremely rude to Miss Bates. Still, the reader cannot ignore the developmental damage that has been caused by Mr Woodhouse's indifferent parenting style as Emma struggles to form healthy adult relationships.\nClass.\nClass is an important aspect of the novel. The distinctions between the classes are made explicitly clear to the reader by Emma herself and by Austen's descriptions. The social class structure has the Woodhouses and Mr Knightley at the top, the Eltons, the Westons, Frank Churchill, and even further down the line Harriet, Robert Martin, and the Bates family including Jane Fairfax. This social class map becomes important when Emma tries to match Mr Elton and Harriet together. Harriet is not considered a match for Elton due to her lowly class standing, despite what Emma encourages her to believe. Emma's initial disregard for class standing (as regards Harriet at least) is brought to light by Mr Knightley who tells her to stop encouraging Harriet.\nThe scholar James Brown argued that the much quoted line where Emma contemplates the Abbey-Mill Farm, which is the embodiment of \"English verdure, English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being oppressive\" is in fact meant to be ironic. Brown wrote that Austen had a strong appreciation of the land as not only a source of aesthetic pleasure, but also a source of money, an aspect of pre-industrial England that many now miss. In this sense, the beauty of the Abbey-Mill Farm is due to the hard work of Mr Knightley's tenant, the farmer Robert Martin, a man whom Emma dismisses as the sort of person \"with whom I feel I can have nothing to do\", while Knightley praises him as \"open, straight forward, and very well judging\". Brown argued that the disconnect between's Emma's contempt for Mr Martin as a person and her awe at the beauty that is the result of his hard work was Austen's way of mocking those in the upper classes who failed to appreciate the farmers who worked the land.\nFood.\nThere is an abundance of food language in \"Emma\". Food is given, shared, and eaten by characters in almost every chapter. Much research on Jane Austen's food language is found in Maggie Lane's book titled \"Jane Austen and Food\". Lane's text provides a general examination of the symbolism of food in Emma and invites further interpretations. Food is used as a symbol to convey class hierarchy, stereotypes and biases throughout the novel. The language and actions that surround food bring the characters of Highbury's inner circle closer together. For Emma Woodhouse, food is a symbol of human interdependence and goodwill. No one in Highbury is starving; everyone takes part in the giving and receiving of food. However, food is a strong class divider though it is rarely openly discussed by characters in the novel. There are a few instances when characters allude to lower class individuals outside of their well-fed society. For instance, when Emma discusses her charitable visit with a poor family, Harriet's encounter with the gypsy children, and Highbury's mysterious chicken thieves. For the most part, the poor in \"Emma\" are overlooked by the characters in the novel due to their socioeconomic status.\nThe constant giving and receiving of food in the novel does not occur without motive. Characters are either trying to climb the social ladder or gain the approval or affections of another. The interpretation of the giving and receiving of food in \"Emma\" can be taken in these different directions; however in terms of love: \"The novel ... is stuffed with gifts of food: Mr Knightley sends the Bates family apples; Mr Martin woos Harriet with some walnuts; and, to further her son's suit, Mrs Martin brings Mrs Goddard a goose\". These gifts are not without motive, and food\u2014as it pertains to Emma Woodhouse\u2014only becomes interesting when it pertains to love. \"[R]omance is a far more interesting subject than food. Emma quickly reduces the topic of eating to a run of the mill 'any thing,' and arbitrary and empty screen that only becomes interesting when projected on by those in love\". This becomes evident to the reader when Emma overestimates Mr Elton's affections for Harriet from their engaging in conversation about the food at the Cole's party. Emma Woodhouse interprets food conversation and gifts of food as means of affection between two lovers.\nMasculinity.\nAusten explores the idea of redefining manhood and masculinity with her male characters: particularly Mr Knightley, Mr Woodhouse, and Frank Churchill. In \"Emma\", Austen includes typical ideals of English masculinity, including, \"familial responsibility, sexual fidelity, and leadership transition \u2026\" Mr Woodhouse is portrayed chiefly as foolish and an incompetent father figure. Clark comments on Mr Woodhouse's age and how this affects his masculine identity. He resists change and pleasure, yet he is still respected in the community. Mr Knightley is Jane Austen's perfect gentleman figure in \"Emma\". He has manners, class, and money. Further, he is presented as, \"a well-adjusted alternative to these more polarized understandings of masculinity seen in characters of John Willoughby and Edward Ferrars.\"\nAllusions to real places.\nThe fictional Highbury is said to be in Surrey, from London and from Richmond. (It is not to be confused with the real Highbury, which is north of Charing Cross, now part of inner London but in Austen's day was in Middlesex.) Highbury was not modelled on a specific village; however, it is likely that it is modelled after several places that Austen knew, such as Cobham and Box Hill. Leatherhead is another place that could have been a source of inspiration for Highbury. There is a Randalls Road in the town, which is an important name within \"Emma\". It has also been noted that there is a Mr Knightly mentioned in Leatherhead Church. Emma's sister Isabella and her family live in Brunswick Square, between the City of London and the West End; the fields had just been transformed at the turn of the century into terraces of Georgian houses. Richmond, where Frank Churchill's aunt and uncle settle in the summer, is now part of the Greater London area, but was then a separate town in Surrey.\nMost of the other places mentioned are in southern England, such as the seaside resort towns of Weymouth, Dorset, Southend, and Cromer in Norfolk. Box Hill is still a place of beauty, popular for picnics. Bath, where Mr Elton went to find a bride, is a well-known spa city in the southwest. The place furthest away is the fictional Enscombe, the estate of the Churchills, in the real Yorkshire, in the north.\nThe school is based on Reading Abbey Girls' School, which Austen and her sister attended briefly:\nnot of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systems \u2013 and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity \u2013 but a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies.\nAdaptations.\n\"Emma\" has been the subject of many adaptations for film, TV, radio and the stage. The profusion of adaptations based on Jane Austen's novels has not only created a large fan base today but has also sparked extensive scholarly examination on both the process and effect of modernizing the narratives and moving them between mediums. Examples of this critical, academic work can be found in texts such as \"Recreating Jane Austen\" by John Wiltshire, \"Jane Austen in Hollywood\" edited by Troost and Greenfield, \"Jane Austen and Co.: Remaking the Past in Contemporary Culture\" edited by Pucci and Thompson, and \"Adapting Jane Austen: The Surprising Fidelity of 'Clueless'\" by William Galperin to name a few.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Within this field there are many sub-fields, ranging from the broad philosophical theories to the focused study of minutiae within specific markets, macroeconomic analysis, microeconomic analysis or financial statement analysis, involving analytical methods and tools such as econometrics, statistics, economics computational models, financial economics, regulatory impact analysis and mathematical economics.\nProfessions.\nEconomists work in many fields including academia, government and in the private sector, where they may also \"study data and statistics in order to spot trends in economic activity, economic confidence levels, and consumer attitudes. They assess this information using advanced methods in statistical analysis, mathematics, computer programming [and] they make recommendations about ways to improve the efficiency of a system or take advantage of trends as they begin.\" In addition to government and academia, economists are also employed in banking, finance, accountancy, commerce, marketing, business administration, lobbying and non- or not-for profit organizations.\nIn many organizations, an \"Economic Analyst\" is a formalized role. Professionals here are employed (or engaged as consultants) to conduct research, prepare reports, or formulate plans and strategies to address economic problems. Here, as outlined, the analyst provides forecasts, analysis and advice, based upon observed trends and economic principles; this entails also collecting and processing economic and statistical data using econometric methods and statistical techniques. \nIn contrast to regulated professions such as engineering, law or medicine, there is not a legally required educational requirement or license for economists. In academia, most economists have a Ph.D. degree in Economics. In the U.S. Government, on the other hand, a person can be hired as an economist provided that they have a degree that included or was supplemented by 21 semester hours in economics and three hours in statistics, accounting, or calculus. In fact, a professional working inside of one of many fields of economics or having an academic degree in this subject is often considered to be an economist; see Bachelor of Economics and Master of Economics.\nBy country.\nEconomics graduates are employable in varying degrees depending on the regional economic scenario and labour market conditions at the time for a given country. Apart from the specific understanding of the subject, employers value the skills of numeracy and analysis, the ability to communicate and the capacity to grasp broad issues which the graduates acquire at the university or college. Whilst only a few economics graduates may be expected to become professional economists, many find it a base for entry into a career in finance \u2013 including accounting, insurance, tax and banking, or management.\nA number of economics graduates from around the world have been successful in obtaining employment in a variety of major national and international firms in the financial and commercial sectors, and in manufacturing, retailing and IT, as well as in the public sector \u2013 for example, in the health and education sectors, or in government and politics. Some graduates go on to undertake postgraduate studies, either in economics, research, teacher training or further qualifications in specialist areas.\nBrazil.\nUnlike most nations, the economist profession in Brazil is regulated by law; specifically, Law No. 1,411, of August 13, 1951. The professional designation of an economist, according to said law, is exclusive to those who graduated with a Bachelor of Economics degree in Brazil.\nUnited States.\nAccording to the United States Department of Labor, there were about 15,000 non-academic economists in the United States in 2008, with a median salary of roughly $83,000, and the top ten percent earning more than $147,040 annually. Nearly 135 colleges and universities grant around 900 new Ph.D.s every year. Incomes are highest for those in the private sector, followed by the federal government, with academia paying the lowest incomes. As of January 2013, PayScale.com showed Ph.D. economists' salary ranges as follows: all Ph.D. economists, $61,000 to $160,000; Ph.D. corporate economists, $71,000 to $207,000; economics full professors, $89,000 to $137,000; economics associate professors, $59,000 to $156,000, and economics assistant professors, $72,000 to $100,000.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe largest single professional grouping of economists in the UK are the more than 3500 members of the Government Economic Service.\nAnalysis of destination surveys for economics graduates from a number of selected top schools of economics in the United Kingdom (ranging from Newcastle University to the London School of Economics), shows nearly 80 percent in employment six months after graduation \u2013 with a wide range of roles and employers, including regional, national and international organisations, across many sectors.\nNotable economists.\nSome current well-known economists include:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; The dictionary definition of \"economist\" at Wiktionary"}

It is located on the north coast of the island of Tongatapu, in the country's southernmost island group.\nHistory.\nFirst western records of Nuku\u02bbalofa.\nOn 10 June 1777, British captain James Cook wrote of his arrival at their anchorage place. His description of the place confirmed, with his map, that this was the bay of Nuku\u02bbalofa.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At length, about two in the afternoon, we arrived at our intended station. It was a very snug place, formed by the shore of Tongataboo on the South East, and two small islands on the East and North East. Here we anchored in ten fathoms water, over a bottom of oozy sand; distant from the shore one-third of a mile [500\u00a0m].\nCook never used the name Nukualofa or any alternative spelling for the reports of this voyage, but he mentioned the island of Pangaimodoo (Pangaimotu) which was to the east of his anchorage position. Captain Cook also wrote that he travelled by canoes to visit Mooa (Mu\u02bba) where Paulaho and other great men lived. The house that Paulaho provided was on the beach from the ship. Reference to his map shows that he must have landed and stayed in the Siesia area, the eastern part of modern Nuku\u02bbalofa. Cook also drafted the first map of the bay of Nuku\u02bbalofa.\nThe first written record for Nuku\u02bbalofa is stated in the first dedicated book for Tonga by George Vason which was published in 1810. George Vason was an English missionary from the London Missionary Society, who arrived in Tonga in 1797. George Vason wrote of their arrival that:\n\"Before we could well come to an anchor, the ship was surrounded by the natives, who flocked to us from every adjacent Island. The place, before which we anchored, was called Noogollefa: it was near an Island, named Bonghy-moddoo; on which former navigators pitched their tents, as a convenient spot, on account of its separation from the main Island, to preserve themselves from being too much incommoded by the natives.\"\nThat was the first mention of Nuku\u02bbalofa, spelled as Noogoollefa. Vason's unusual spelling of Nuku\u02bbalofa and Pangaimotu (as \"Bonghy-Moddoo\") was because the standard Tongan alphabet would not be developed until 1826\u201327.\nThe second oldest book dedicated to Tonga was by William Mariner, adopted son of F\u012bnau \u02bbUluk\u0101lala, which was published in 1817. Mariner described his experiences during the years he was the adopted son of \u02bbUluk\u0101lala (1806\u20131810). He described the civil war and the siege of the Fort of Nuku\u02bbalofa, which fell to \u02bbUluk\u0101lala and his warriors.\nThe third attempt of Christian missionaries was recorded in April 1826, when two Tahitian London Missionaries were detained by Tupou the chief of Nuku\u02bbalofa.\nIn March 1826, the four men left Tahiti in the Minerva, their destination Fiji. But at Nuku\u02bbalofa, Tonga, their plans were disrupted by the high chief Tupou (Aleamotu\u02bba). From Davies' perspective the Tahitian were placed under detention at Tongatapu: \"The chief called Tupou would not let them proceed. He had been himself a resident in Lageba and calls himself the friend of Tuineau, the chief of Lageba and as such he took possession of the present intended for the Fijian chief\".\nThe arrival of the Methodist missionaries in Nuku\u02bbalofa in 1827 reinforced the Christian faith. The persecution suffered by Christians in Hihifo and Hahake forced a lot of people to seek refuge in Nuku\u02bbalofa. As a result of the encouragement of Tupou, the King of Nuku\u02bbalofa, this was the beginning of the expanding of Nuku\u02bbalofa to become the major center of Christianity in Tonga.\nThe US Exploring Expedition met with King Josiah (Aleamotu\u02bba) in 1840.\nThe final phase of the arrival of Christianity in Tonga was the arrival of Father Chevron, or Patele Sevelo, in 1842. He wrote that he arrived in Nuku\u02bbalofa in 1842 and met the Tu\u02bbi Kanokupolu Aleamotu\u02bba who was baptised by the Wesleyan as Sosaia.\nIn conclusion, these landings turned Nuku\u02bbalofa from a small village and fort into the center of Tonga during the introduction of Christianity. From the earliest records for Nuku\u02bbalofa, early writers always referred to the settlement as Noogollefa (1797), Nioocalofa (1806), Nukualofa (1826 by Methodist) and Noukou-Alofa (1842 by French Catholic priests). There was no other mention of any other name of the settlement other than the settlement or fort of Nuku\u02bbalofa.\nCapital of the Kingdom of Tonga (1875 and later).\nThe Declaration of the Constitution of Tonga in 1875 formalised Nuku\u02bbalofa as the Capital of Tonga. King George Taufa\u02bbahau Tupou I issued the Constitution of Tonga on 4 November 1875, in Nuku\u02bbalofa. The Constitution also stated (Article 38) that the Parliament will meet in Nuku\u02bbalofa except in time of war.\nSince Nuku\u02bbalofa has been expanding from when it became the center of Christianity in Tonga in the 19th century, it became essential that it was reorganised for effective administration of the capital. The reorganisation of Nuku\u02bbalofa divided up Nuku\u02bbalofa into three major district areas:\n21st century.\nIn 2006, lack of progress towards democracy resulted in riots in Nuku\u02bbalofa. During the riots, much of the central business district was burned down.\nThe capital city was struck by the tsunami caused by the 2022 Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha\u02bbapai eruption. The city reportedly suffered significant damage from the tsunami, which may potentially take years to repair.\nGovernment.\nThe national government is based in Nuku\u02bbalofa. The parliament of Tonga meets there, and the Royal Palace is located near the city.\nThe name is said to have originated when Mo\u02bbungatonga, the 6th Tu\u02bbi Ha\u02bbatakalaua (King who governs the daily business of Tonga on behalf of the Tu\u02bbi Tonga or Sacred King of Tonga) sent his youngest son, Ngata (later to be 1st Tu\u02bbi Kanokupolu) as governor to Hihifo (Western side of Tongatapu). It was a difficult decision for Ngata as the Tu\u02bbi Tonga and Tu\u02bbi Ha\u02bbatakalaua have been unable to control Hihifo. Ngata had many reasons to fear for his life as his predecessors had been killed by the chiefs and people of Hihifo.\nBetween 12 and 13 February 2018, the Tongan Parliament House was destroyed by Cyclone Gita, a category 4 cyclone that hit the nation. As a result, the Parliament was moved to the Tongan National Centre, south of the city centre, and that parcel of land gazetted as a part of Nuku\u02bbalofa.\nClimate.\nNuku\u02bbalofa features a tropical rainforest climate (Af) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. The area does experience noticeably wetter and drier periods during the year, but it does not have a true dry season month where monthly precipitation falls below . Temperatures are slightly warmer during January and February where average temperatures hover around than June and July where the average temperatures is roughly . Nuku\u02bbalofa sees a little more than of precipitation annually. As the trade winds are almost permanent and cyclones are not rare in Nuku\u02bbalofa, the climate is not equatorial but maritime trade-wind tropical climate.\nEconomy.\nNuku\u02bbalofa is the economic hub of the country.\nPeau Vava\u02bbu, an airline, had its head office in the Pacific Royale Hotel in Nuku\u02bbalofa. The former Royal Tongan Airlines had its head office in the Royco Building in Nuku\u02bbalofa.\nThe city has markets and a central business district. Much of the central business district was destroyed during the 2006 Nuku\u02bbalofa riots. Reconstruction started in 2008, funded by a US$55 million loan from China.\nThe city has a number of tourist hotels.\nTransport.\nNuku\u02bbalofa is the central hub for transport in Tonga.\nBuses arrive and depart from the central bus station along Vuna Road close to the centre of town. Bus services are privately operated, and their drivers are free to set their own schedules. Fares are fixed by the government, with reduced rates for school children. The buses are usually filled to capacity. In addition, some schools and large hotels provide their own buses.\nThere are numerous taxis, also privately owned. Many people who own a car earn extra money by providing taxi services in their spare time. Taxi fares are also set by the government. Most families have their own car; few residents ride bicycles. There are no operational railways or trams in Tonga, although there was once a narrow-gauge railway from the lagoon to the wharf, which gave its name to Railway Road.\nNuku\u02bbalofa harbour is the only deep-water harbour of the island, which determined its selection as the site for the capital. For many years Vuna Wharf was the international harbour until it was destroyed by an earthquake in 1977. A new, much larger wharf was built towards Ma\u02bbufanga, named after Queen S\u0101lote. Between these two wharves is the wharf numbered '42', used by fishermen and inter-island ferries. It is the central hub for boats to the outer islands. There are usually two boats to \u02bbEua each day and two to Ha\u02bbapai and Vava\u02bbu each week. In addition to these regular services by shipping companies, private boat owners provide less regular services to smaller islands such as Nomuka and \u02bbEueiki.\nAir transport is provided by Fua\u02bbamotu International Airport on the south side of Tongatapu, 34\u201337\u00a0km from Nuku'alofa \u02bb.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nNuku\u02bbalofa is twinned with:\nEndnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

It has the primary objective to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and coordinate foreign policy. The organisation was established in 1973, by its four founding members signing the Treaty of Chaguaramas.\nThe secretariat headquarters is in Georgetown, Guyana. CARICOM has been granted the official United Nations General Assembly observer status.\nHistory.\nCARICOM, originally The Caribbean Community and Common Market, was established by the Treaty of Chaguaramas which took effect on 1 August 1973. Founding states were Barbados, Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe Caribbean Community superseded the 1965\u20131972 Caribbean Free Trade Association organised to provide a continued economic linkage between the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean after the dissolution of the West Indies Federation, which lasted from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962.\nA revised Treaty of Chaguaramas established \"The Caribbean Community including the CARICOM Single Market and Economy, security, foreign exchange\" and was signed by the CARICOM Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community on 5 July 2001 at their Twenty-Second Meeting of the Conference in Nassau, The Bahamas. The revised treaty cleared the way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into the Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy.\nHaiti's membership in CARICOM remained effectively suspended from 29 February 2004 through early June 2006 following the 2004 Haitian coup d'\u00e9tat and the removal of Jean-Bertrand Aristide from the presidency. CARICOM announced that no democratically elected government in CARICOM should have its leader deposed. The fourteen other heads of government sought to have Aristide fly from Africa to Jamaica and share his account of events with them, which infuriated the interim Haitian prime minister, G\u00e9rard Latortue, who announced he would take steps to take Haiti out of CARICOM. CARICOM thus voted on suspending the participation of Haitian officials from the councils of CARICOM. Following the presidential election of Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, Haitian officials were readmitted and Pr\u00e9val himself gave the opening address at the CARICOM Council of Ministers meeting in July.\nSince 2013 the CARICOM-bloc and with the Dominican Republic have been tied to the European Union via an Economic Partnership Agreements signed in 2008 known as CARIFORUM. The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment. Under Article 234 of the agreement, the European Court of Justice handles dispute resolution between CARIFORUM and European Union states.\nOn 1 October 2025, four Caricom members\u2014Barbados, Belize, Dominica, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines\u2014implemented full freedom of movement, going beyond the freedom of movement only for skilled workers that other Caricom members have implemented.\nAgenda and goals.\nCARICOM was established by the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean and currently includes all the independent Anglophone island countries plus Belize, Guyana, Montserrat and Suriname, as well as all other British Caribbean territories and Bermuda as associate members. English was its sole working language into the 1990s. The organisation became multilingual with the addition of Dutch and Sranan Tongo-speaking Suriname in 1995 and the French and Haitian Creole-speaking Haiti in 2002. Furthermore, it added Spanish as the fourth official language in 2003. In July 2012, CARICOM announced they considered making French and Dutch official languages. In 2001, the Conference of Heads of Governments signed a revised Treaty of Chaguaramas that cleared the way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into the CARICOM Single Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty establishes and implements the Caribbean Court of Justice. Its primary activities involve:\nOrganisational structure.\nThe following is the overall structure of Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\nChairmanship.\nThe post of Chairman (Head of CARICOM) is held in rotation by the regional Heads of Government of CARICOM's 15 member states. These include Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Haiti, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, The Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago.\nHeads of government.\nCARICOM contains a quasi-Cabinet of the individual Heads of Government. These heads are given specialised portfolios of responsibility for regional development and integration.\nSecretariat.\nThe Secretariat of the Caribbean Community is the Chief Administrative Organ for CARICOM. The Secretary-General of the Caribbean Community is the chief executive and handles foreign and community relations. Five years is the term of office of the Secretary-General, which may be renewed. The Deputy Secretary-General of the Caribbean Community handles human and Social Development. The General Counsel of the Caribbean Community handles trade and economic integration.\nThe goal statement of the CARICOM Secretariat is: \"To contribute, in support of Member States, to the improvement of the quality of life of the People of the Community and the development of an innovative and productive society in partnership with institutions and groups working towards attaining a people-centred, sustainable and internationally competitive Community.\"\nOrgans and bodies.\nCommunity Council.\nThe Community Council comprises ministers responsible for community affairs and any other Minister designated by the member states at their discretion. It is one of the community's principal organs; the other is the Conference of the Heads of Government. Four other organs and three bodies support it.\nInstitutions.\nThe following institutions are founded by or affiliated to the Caricom:\nCancelled.\nThe following institutions have been cancelled or merged into other ones:\nRelationship to other supranational Caribbean organisations.\nAssociation of Caribbean States.\nCARICOM was instrumental in the formation of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) on 24 July 1994. The original idea for the Association came from a recommendation of the West Indian Commission, established in 1989 by the CARICOM heads of state and government. The Commission advocated both deepening the integration process (through the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) and complementing it through a separate regional organisation encompassing all states in the Caribbean.\nCARICOM accepted the commission's recommendations and opened dialogue with other Caribbean states, the Central American states and the Latin American nations of Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico which border the Caribbean, for consultation on the proposals of the West Indian Commission.\nAt an October 1993 summit, the heads of state and government of CARICOM and the presidents of the then-Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) formally decided to create an association grouping all states of the Caribbean basin. A work schedule for its formation was adopted. The aim was to create the association in less than a year, an objective which was achieved with the formal creation of the ACS.\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States.\nCARICOM was also involved in the formation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) on 3 December 2010. The idea for CELAC originated at the Rio Group\u2013Caribbean Community Unity Summit on 23 February 2010 in Mexico. This act caters to the integration of the Americas process, complimenting well-established initiatives of the Organization of American States.\nEuropean Union: Economic Partnership Agreements.\nSince 2013, the CARICOM-bloc and the Dominican Republic have been tied to the European Union via an Economic Partnership Agreements known as CARIFORUM signed in 2008. The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment. Within the agreement under Article 234, the European Court of Justice also carries dispute resolution mechanisms between CARIFORUM and the states of the European Union.\nOHADAC Project.\nIn May 2016, Caricom's court of original jurisdiction, the CCJ, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the ACP Legal Association based in Guadeloupe recognising and supporting the goals of implementing a harmonised business law framework in the Caribbean through ACP Legal Association's OHADAC Project.\nOHADAC is the acronym for the French \"Organisation pour l'Harmonisation du Droit des Affaires en les Cara\u00efbes\", which translates into English as \"Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in the Caribbean\". The OHADAC Project takes inspiration from a similar organisation in Africa and aims to enhance economic integration across the entire Caribbean and facilitate increased trade and international investment through unified laws and alternative dispute resolution methods.\nMember states.\nAs of 2024[ [update]] CARICOM has 15 full members, seven associate members and eight observers. The associated members are five British Overseas Territories, one constituent county of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and one French Overseas Territory. It is currently not established what the role of the associate members will be. The observers are states which engage in at least one of CARICOM's technical committees.\nUnder Article 4 CARICOM breaks its 15 member states into two groups: Less Developed Countries (LDCs) and More Developed Countries (MDCs).\nThe countries of CARICOM which are designated as Less Developed Countries (LDCs) are as follows:\nThe countries of CARICOM which are designated as More Developed Countries (MDCs) are:\nThousands of Caricom nationals live within other member states of the Community.\nAn estimated 30,000 Jamaicans legally reside in other CARICOM member states, mainly in The Bahamas (6,200), Antigua &amp; Barbuda (estimated 12,000), Barbados and Trinidad &amp; Tobago). Also, an estimated 150 Jamaicans live and work in Montserrat. A 21 November 2013 estimated put 16,958 Jamaicans residing illegally in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, as according to the records of the Office of the Chief Immigration Officer, their entry certificates would have since expired. By October 2014, the estimated Jamaicans residing illegally in Trinidad and Tobago was 19,000 along with an estimated 7,169 Barbadians and 25,884 Guyanese residing illegally. An estimated 8,000 Trinidadians and Tobagonians live in Jamaica.\nBarbados hosts a large diaspora population of Guyanese, of whom (in 2005) 5,032 lived there permanently as citizens, permanent residents, immigrants (with immigrant status) and Caricom skilled nationals; 3,200 were residing in Barbados temporarily under work permits, as students, or with \"reside and work\" status. A further 2,000\u20133,000 Guyanese were estimated to be living illegally in Barbados at the time. Migration between Barbados and Guyana has deep roots, going back over 150 years, with the most intense period of Barbadian migration to then-British Guiana occurring between 1863 and 1886, although as late as the 1920s and 1930s Barbadians were still leaving Barbados for British Guiana.\nMigration between Guyana and Suriname also goes back a number of years. An estimated 50,000 Guyanese had migrated to Suriname by 1986 In 1987 an estimated 30\u201340,000 Guyanese were in Suriname. Many Guyanese left Suriname in the 1970s and 1980s, either voluntarily or by expulsion. Citing a national security concern, over 5,000 were expelled in January 1985 alone. In the instability Suriname experienced following independence, both coups and civil war. In 2013, an estimated 11,530 Guyanese had emigrated to Suriname and 4,662 Surinamese to Guyana.\nRelationship with Cuba.\nIn 2017, the Republic of Cuba and CARICOM signed the \"CARICOM-Cuba Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement\" to facilitate closer trade ties. In December 2022, President of Cuba Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel met in Bridgetown, Barbados with the Heads of State and Government of CARICOM. On the occasion of the 8th CARICOM-Cuba Summit to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations with the independent States of CARICOM and Cuba and the 20th Anniversary of CARICOM-Cuba Day. Cuba also accepted CARICOM's offer to deepen bilateral cooperation and to join robust discussions in the bloc's regional 'Joint Ministerial Taskforce on Food production and Security'.\nDialogue partners / accreditation to CARICOM.\nA number of global partners have established diplomatic representation to the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat located in Georgetown, Guyana. Nations with non-resident representatives to CARICOM in \"italics:\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSymbols.\nStandard.\nThe flag of the Caribbean Community was chosen and approved in November 1983 at the Conference of Heads of Government Meeting in Port of Spain, Trinidad. The original design by the firm of WINART Studies in Georgetown, Guyana was substantially modified at the July 1983 Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government. The flag was first flown on 4 July 1984 in Nassau, The Bahamas at the fifth Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government.\nThe flag features a blue background, but the upper part is a light blue representing sky and the lower, a darker blue representing the Caribbean Sea. The yellow circle in the centre represents the sun on which is printed in black the logo of the Caribbean Community, two interlocking Cs. The two Cs are in the form of broken links in a chain, symbolising both unity and a break with the colonial past. The narrow ring of green around the sun represents the vegetation of the region.\nSong.\nFor CARICOM's 40th anniversary, a competition to compose an official song or anthem for CARICOM was launched in April 2013 to promote choosing a song that promoted unity and inspired CARICOM identity and pride. A regional panel of judges comprising independent experts in music was nominated by member states and the CARICOM Secretariat. Three rounds of competition condensed 63 entries to a final three, from which judges chose \"Celebrating CARICOM\" by Michele Henderson of Dominica in March 2014. Henderson won a US$10,000 prize. Her song was produced by her husband, Roland Delsol Jr., and arranged by Earlson Matthew. It also featured Michael Ferrol on drums and choral input from the St. Alphonsus Choir. It was re-produced for CARICOM by Carl Beaver Henderson of Trinidad and Tobago.\nA second-place entry titled \"My CARICOM\" came from Jamaican Adiel Thomas who won US$5,000, and a third-place song titled \"One CARICOM\" by Carmella Lawrence of St. Kitts and Nevis, won US$2,500. The other songs from the top-ten finalists (in no particular order) were:\nThe first official performance of \"Celebrating CARICOM\" by Henderson took place on Tuesday 1 July 2014 at the opening ceremony for the Thirty-Fifth Regional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government in Antigua and Barbuda.\nCelebration.\nCARICOM Day.\nThe celebration of CARICOM Day is the selected day some Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries officially recognise the commemorative date of signing of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, the agreement that established CARICOM on 4 July 1973. The Treaty was signed in Chaguaramas, Trinidad &amp; Tobago by then leaders of: Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. CARICOM Day is recognised as an official public holiday in Guyana where the secretariat is based, and is observed on the first Monday of July. The government of Antigua and Barbuda has also implemented CARICOM Day as a holiday.\nThe day features activities that are organised by government entities such as parades, pageants, and campaigns to educate people about CARICOM.\nCaribbean Festival of Arts \u2013 CARIFESTA.\nCaribbean Festival of Arts, commonly known as CARIFESTA, is an annual festival for promoting arts of the Caribbean with a different country hosting the event each year. It was started to provide a venue to \"depict the life of the people of the Region, their heroes, morals, myths, traditions, beliefs, creativity and ways of expression\" by fostering a sense of Caribbean unity, and motivating artists by showing the best of their home country. It began under the auspices of Guyana's then President Forbes Burnham in 1972, who was inspired by other singular arts festivals in the region.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57361", "revid": "50605827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57361", "title": "Panama City", "text": "Capital city of Panama\nPanama City, also known as Panama, is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Panama. It has a total population of 410,354 in the city proper and 1,086,990 in the Panama District, which includes the outer corregimientos of the city. The metropolitan area has over 2,100,000 people. The city is located at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal, in the province of Panama. The city is the political and administrative center of the country, as well as a hub for banking and commerce.\nThe city of Panama was founded on 15 August 1519, by Spanish conquistador Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila. The city was the starting point for expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire of Peru. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the American continent, leading to the fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo, through which passed most of the gold and silver that Spain mined from the Americas.\nOn 28 January 1671, the original city was destroyed by a fire when the privateer Henry Morgan sacked and set fire to it. The city was formally reestablished two years later on 21 January 1673, on a peninsula located from the original settlement. The site of the previously devastated city is still in ruins, and is now a World Heritage Site and popular tourist attraction, regularly visited by school trips.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded on 15 August 1519, by Pedro Arias de \u00c1vila, also known as Pedrarias D\u00e1vila. Within a few years of its founding, the city became a launching point for the exploration and conquest of Peru and a transit point for gold and silver headed back to Spain through the Isthmus. The Genoese-Italians and the Spanish encountered coconuts from the Philippines which the Malayo-Polynesians brought before Spanish colonization. In 1520, Genoese merchants controlled the port and the commerce of the region, mainly for the slave trade, thanks to a concession given by the Spaniards, who had the Republic of Genoa as its main banking base.\nIn 1671 Henry Morgan with a band of 1,400 men attacked and looted the city, which was subsequently destroyed by fire. The ruins of the old city still remain and are a popular tourist attraction known as Panam\u00e1 Viejo (Old Panama). The city was rebuilt in 1673 in a new location approximately southwest of the original city. This location is now known as the Casco Viejo (Old Quarter) of the city. Panama City is the fourth earliest-founded of the modern-day capital cities in the Americas.\nOne year before the start of the California Gold Rush, the Panama Railroad Company was formed, but the railroad did not begin full operation until 1855. Between 1848 and 1869, the year the first transcontinental railroad was completed in the United States, about 375,000 people crossed the isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and 225,000 in the opposite direction. This traffic greatly increased the prosperity of the city during that period.\nAfter declaring independence from Colombia on 3 November 1903, Philippe Bunau-Varilla (a French engineer) was named Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. Bunau-Varilla negotiated the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, which provided the United States with a 10-mile-wide strip of land for the canal, a one-time $10 million payment to Panama, and an annual annuity of $250,000. The United States also agreed to guarantee the independence of Panama. Completed in 1914, the Panama Canal symbolized U.S. technological prowess and economic power. Although U.S. control of the canal eventually became an irritant to U.S.-Panamanian relations, at the time it was heralded as a major foreign policy achievement.\nThe construction of the Panama Canal was of great benefit to the infrastructure and economy. Of particular note are the improvements in health and sanitation brought about by the American presence in the Canal Zone. William Gorgas, the chief sanitary officer for the canal construction, had a particularly large impact. He hypothesized that diseases were spread by the abundance of mosquitos native to the area, and ordered the fumigation of homes and the cleansing of water. This led to yellow fever being eradicated by November 1905, as well malaria rates falling dramatically. However, most of the laborers for the construction of the canal were brought in from the Caribbean, which created unprecedented racial and social tensions in the city.\nDuring World War II, construction of military bases and the presence of larger numbers of U.S. military and civilian personnel brought about unprecedented levels of prosperity to the city. Panamanians had limited access, or no access at all, to many areas in the Canal Zone neighboring the Panama city metropolitan area. Some of these areas were military bases accessible only to United States personnel. Some tensions arose between the people of Panama and the U.S. citizens living in the Panama Canal Zone. This erupted in the 9 January 1964, events, known as Martyrs' Day.\nIn the late 1970s through the 1980s the city of Panama became an international banking center, bringing a lot of undesirable attention as an international money-laundering locale. In 1989 after nearly a year of tension between the United States and Panama, President George H. W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama to depose General Manuel Noriega, the country's de facto dictator. As a result, a portion of the El Chorrillo neighborhood, which consisted mostly of old wood-framed buildings dating back to the 1900s (though still a large slum area), was destroyed by fire. In 1999, the United States officially transferred full control of the Panama Canal to the Republic of Panama, which remains in control today.\nThe city of Panama is still a banking center, although with very visible controls in the flow of cash. Shipping is handled through port facilities in the area of Balboa operated by the Hutchison Whampoa Company of Hong Kong and through several ports on the Caribbean side of the isthmus. Balboa, which is located within the greater Panama metropolitan area, was formerly part of the Panama Canal Zone, and the administration of the former Panama Canal Zone was headquartered there.\nGeography.\nPanam\u00e1 is located between the Pacific Ocean and tropical rain forest in the northern part of Panama. The \"Parque Natural Metropolitano\" (Metropolitan Nature Park), stretching from Panama City along the Panama Canal, has unique bird species and other animals, such as tapir, puma, and caimans. At the Pacific entrance of the canal is the \"Centro de Exhibiciones Marinas\" (Marine Exhibitions Center), a research center for those interested in tropical marine life and ecology, managed by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.\nTropical forests around Panama are vital for the functioning of the Panama Canal, providing it with the water required for its operation. Due to the canal's importance to the Panamanian economy, tropical forests around the canal have been kept in an almost pristine state; the canal is thus a rare example of a vast engineering project in the middle of a forest that helped to preserve that forest. Along the western side of the canal is the \"Parque Nacional Soberan\u00eda\" (Sovereignty National Park), which includes the Summit botanical gardens and a zoo. The best known trail in this national park is Pipeline Road, popular among birdwatchers.\nNearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Most are unnavigable; many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the R\u00edo Chepo and the R\u00edo Chagres, both within the boundaries of the city, work as sources of hydroelectric power.\nThe R\u00edo Chagres is one of the longest and most vital of the approximately 150 rivers that flow into the Caribbean. Part of this river was dammed to create Gatun Lake, which forms a major part of the transit route between the locks near each end of the canal. Both Gatun Lake and Madden Lake (also filled with water from the R\u00edo Chagres) provide hydroelectricity to the former Canal Zone area. The R\u00edo Chepo, another major source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific.\nClimate.\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Panama City has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Aw\"), a little drier than a tropical monsoon climate. It sees of precipitation annually. The wet season spans from May through December, and the dry season spans from January through April. Temperatures remain constant throughout the year, averaging around . Sunshine is subdued in Panama because it lies in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where there is a nearly continual cloud formation, even during the dry season.\nCityscape.\nArchitecture.\nPanama's old quarter (or Casco Viejo, Panama) features many architectural styles, from Spanish colonial buildings to French and Antillean townhouses built during the construction of the Panama Canal. The more modern areas of the city have many high-rise buildings, which together form a very dense skyline. There are more than 110 high-rise projects under construction, with 127 already built. The city holds the 45th place in the world by high-rise buildings count.\nThe Centennial Bridge that crosses the Panama Canal earned the American Segmental Bridge Institute prize of excellence, along with seven other bridges in the Americas.\nNeighborhoods.\nThe city is located in Panama District, although its metropolitan area also includes some populated areas on the opposite side of the Panama Canal. As in the rest of the country, the city is divided into \"corregimientos\", in which there are many smaller boroughs. The old quarter, known as the \"Casco Viejo\", is located in the \"corregimiento\" of San Felipe. San Felipe and twelve other \"corregimientos\" form the urban center of the city, including Santa Ana, El Chorrillo, Calidonia, Curund\u00fa, Anc\u00f3n, Bella Vista, Bethania, San Francisco, Juan Diaz, Pueblo Nuevo, Parque Lefevre, and R\u00edo Abajo.\nEconomy.\nAs the economic and financial center of the country, Panama City's economy is service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce, and tourism. The economy depends significantly on trade and shipping activities associated with the Panama Canal and port facilities located in Balboa. Panama's status as a convergence zone for capital from around the world due to the canal helped the city establish itself as a prime location for offshore banking and tax planning. Consequently, the economy has relied on accountants and lawyers who help global corporations navigate the regulatory landscape. The city has benefited from significant economic growth in recent years, mainly due to the ongoing expansion of the Panama Canal, an increase in real estate investment, and a relatively stable banking sector. There are around eighty banks in the city, at least fifteen of which are local.\nPanama City is responsible for the production of approximately 55% of the country's GDP. This is because most Panamanian businesses and premises are located in the city and its metro area. It is a stopover for other destinations in the country, as well as a transit point and tourist destination in itself.\nTourism is one of the most important economic activities in terms of revenue generation. This sector of the economy has seen a great deal of growth since the transfer of the Panama Canal Zone at the end of the twentieth century. The number of hotel rooms increased by more than ten-fold, from 1,400 in 1997 to more than 15,000 in 2013, while the number of annual visitors increased from 457,000 in 1999 to 1.4\u00a0million in 2011. The city's hotel occupancy rate has always been relatively high, reaching the second highest for any city outside the United States in 2008, after Perth, Australia, and followed by Dubai. However, hotel occupancy rates have dropped since 2009, probably due to the opening of many new luxury hotels. Several international hotel chains, such as Le M\u00e9ridien, Radisson, and RIU, have opened or plan to open new hotels in the city, along with those previously operating under Marriott, Sheraton, InterContinental, and other foreign and local brands. The Trump Organization built the Trump Ocean Club, its first investment in Latin America, in 2006 and it is the tallest building in the city. In 2018 it was renamed The Bahia Grand Panama following falling occupancy rates associated with the declining brand value of the Trump name. Meanwhile, it is a JW Marriott property. Hilton Worldwide opened a Hilton Garden Inn in El Cangrejo, and in 2013, The Panamera, the second Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Latin America.\nLand reclamation projects have created additional new land for highways, housing, and parkland developments, Cinta Costera.\nDemographics.\nThe city proper has 410,354 inhabitants in 13 corregimientos. There are 13 others that form the larger Panama District. The inhabitants of Panama City are commonly referred to as \"capitalinos\" and include large numbers of mestizos (70%), people with mixed Caribbean and European/Amerindian ancestry (14%), white people (10%), Amerindians (6%), as well as Afro-Panamanians. There is a great deal of cultural diversity within the city, which manifests itself in the wide variety of languages commonly spoken, such as German, Portuguese, French, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew and English, in addition to Spanish.\nCulture.\nWorld Heritage Sites.\nPanam\u00e1 Viejo.\nPanam\u00e1 Viejo (\"Old Panama\") is the name used for the architectural vestiges of the Monumental Historic Complex of the first Spanish city founded on the Pacific coast of the Americas by Pedro Arias de \u00c1vila on 15 August 1519. This city was the starting point for the expeditions that conquered the Inca Empire in Peru in 1532. It was a stopover point on one of the most important trade routes in the history of the American continent, leading to the famous fairs of Nombre de Dios and Portobelo, where most of the gold and silver that Spain took from the Americas passed through.\nCasco Viejo or Casco Antiguo.\nBuilt and settled in 1671 after the destruction of Panama Viejo by the privateer Henry Morgan, the historic district of Panama City (known as Casco Viejo, Casco Antiguo or San Felipe) was conceived as a walled city to protect its settlers against future pirate attacks. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2003.\nCasco Antiguo displays a mix of architectural styles that reflect the country's cultural diversity: Caribbean, Republican, art deco, French, and colonial architecture mix in a site comprising around 800 buildings. Most of Panama City's main monuments are located in Casco Antiguo, including the Sal\u00f3n Bolivar, the National Theater (founded in 1908), Las B\u00f3vedas, and Plaza de Francia. There are also many Catholic buildings, such as the Metropolitan Cathedral, the La Merced Church, and the St. Philip Neri Church. The distinctive golden altar at St. Joseph Church was one of the few items saved from Panama Viejo during the 1671 pirate siege. It was buried in mud during the siege and then secretly transported to its present location.\nUndergoing redevelopment and gentrification, the old quarter has become one of the city's main tourist attractions, second only to the Panama Canal. Both government and private sectors are working on its restoration. President Ricardo Martinelli built an extension to the Cinta Costera maritime highway viaduct in 2014 named \"Cinta Costera 3\" around the Casco Antiguo.\nBefore the Cinta Costera 3 project was built there were protests. Much of the controversy surrounding the project involved the possibility that Casco Viejo would lose its World Heritage status. On 28 June 2012, UNESCO decided that Casco Viejo will not be put on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. \nLiterature.\nAccording to Professor Rodrigo Mir\u00f3, the first story about Panama was written by Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s and published as part of the \"Historia General y Natural de Las Indias\" in 1535. Some authors born in Panam\u00e1 city are Manuel Mar\u00eda Ayala (1785\u20131824), Amelia Denis de Icaza (1836\u20131911), Dar\u00edo Herrera (1870\u20131914), Ricardo Mir\u00f3 (1883\u20131940), Gaspar Octavio Hern\u00e1ndez (1893\u20131918), Demetrio Korsi (1899\u20131957), Ricardo Berm\u00fadez (1914\u20132000), Joaqu\u00edn Bele\u00f1o (1921\u201388), Ernesto Endara (1932\u2013), Diana Mor\u00e1n (1932\u201387), Rosa Mar\u00eda Britton (1936\u20132019), Jos\u00e9 C\u00f3rdova (1937\u2013), Pedro Rivera (1939\u2013), Moravia Ochoa L\u00f3pez (1941\u2013), Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez Iglesias (1941\u2013), (1942 \u2013), Jarl Ricardo Babot (1946\u2013), Giovanna Benedetti (1949\u2013), \u00c9dgar Sober\u00f3n Torchia (1951-), Manuel Orestes Nieto (1951\u2013), Mois\u00e9s Pascual (1955\u2013), Nyra Sober\u00f3n Torchia (1955-), H\u00e9ctor Miguel Collado (1960\u2013), David Robinson Orobio (1960\u2013), Katia Chiari (1969\u2013), Carlos Oriel Wynter Melo (1971\u2013), Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Pitt\u00ed (1971\u2013), Arturo Wong Sagel (1980\u2013) and Sof\u00eda Santim (1982\u2013).\nArt.\nOne of the most important Panamanian artists is Alfredo Sinclair. He has worked for over 50 years in abstract art and has produced one of the most important artistic collections in the country. His daughter, Olga Sinclair, has also followed in his footsteps and has become another force in Panamanian art. Another very prominent Panamanian artist is Guillermo Trujillo, known worldwide for his abstract surrealism.\nBrooke Alfaro is a Panamanian artist known throughout the world for his uniquely rendered oil paintings.\nAnother prominent artist is Mario Calvit, known as one of the great painters of the generation that flourished in the country between the decades of 1950 and 1970.\nTourism.\nTourism in Panama City includes many different historic sites and locations related to the operation of the Panama Canal. A few of these sites are the following: \nIn addition to these tourist attractions, Panama City offers many different options when it comes to hotel accommodations, including the first Waldorf Astoria hotel to open in Latin America, and many small boutique style hotels that have smaller numbers of guest rooms and offer a more intimate vacation. Nightlife in the city is centered around the Calle Uruguay and Casco Viejo neighborhoods. These neighborhoods contain a variety of different bars and nightclubs that cater to the tourists visiting the city.\nOne of the newer tourist areas of the city is the area immediately east of the Pacific entrance of the canal, known as the Amador Causeway. This area is being developed as a tourist center and nightlife destination. The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute operates a station and a small museum open to the public at Culebra Point on the island of Naos. A new museum, the Biomuseo, was recently completed on the causeway in 2014. It was designed by the American architect Frank Gehry, famous for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Just outside the city limits is the Parque Municipal Summit. A new convention center called the Amador Convention Center is being built in Amador by CSCEC in a joint venture with a Panamanian company called CCG Cocige. The Panamanian ministry of Tourism hopes for the convention center to house 100 international events annually. There were plans (proposed by Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela) to build in Amador a campus for the embassy of the People's Republic of China in Panama, however the plans were eventually dropped, due to criticism from the general public and fears that tourists could easily assume that Panama was Chinese territory. Varela in response said that Amador is an area that \"must have more value\".\nThe United States State Department notes the presence of crimes in the city, some of which include violent acts such as shootings, rape, armed robbery, and intentional kidnapping. The United States State Department also warns tourists about the purchasing of counterfeited or pirated goods, as they may be in violation of local Panamanian laws. In terms of LGBT rights in the city, same sex marriage is not recognized by the government but there are laws in place to prevent discrimination against the LGBT community.\nSports.\nThroughout the 20th century, Panama City has excelled in boxing, baseball, basketball, and soccer. These sports have produced famous athletes such as Roberto Dur\u00e1n, Rommel Fern\u00e1ndez, Rolando Blackman, Julio Dely Vald\u00e9s, Mariano Rivera, and Rod Carew. Today, these sports have clubs and associations that manage their development in the city. Panama Metro is the city's baseball team. There are boxing training centers in different gyms throughout the city's neighborhoods. There are also many football clubs, such as:\nThe city has four professional teams in the country's second-level league, Liga Nacional de Ascenso:\nThere are two main stadiums in Panama City, the National Baseball Stadium (also known as Rod Carew Stadium) and the Rommel Fern\u00e1ndez Stadium, with capacities of 27,000 and 32,000 respectively. Additionally, the Roberto Dur\u00e1n Arena has a capacity of 18,000.\nEducation.\nThe city has both public and private schools. Most private schools are bilingual (English and Spanish). Higher education is headed by two major public universities: the University of Panama and the Technological University of Panama. There are private universities, such as the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Santa Mar\u00eda La Antigua, the Universidad Latina de Panama, the Universidad Latinoamericana de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (ULACIT), the Distance and Open University of Panama (UNADP), Universidad del Istmo Panama, the Universidad Maritima Internacional de Panama, and the Universidad Especializada de las Americas. Also, there are Panama Branches of the Nova Southeastern University (its main campus is in Ft. Lauderdale in Broward County, Florida); the University of Oklahoma; the Central Texas University; the University of Louisville which runs a sister campus in the city, and the Florida State University, which operates a broad curriculum program in an academic and technological park known as Ciudad del Saber.\nHealthcare.\nPanama City is home to at least 14 hospitals and an extensive network of public and private clinics, including the Hospital Santo Tom\u00e1s, Hospital del Ni\u00f1o, Complejo Hospitalario Arnulfo Arias Madrid, Centro M\u00e9dico Paitilla, Hospital Santa F\u00e9, Hospital Nacional, Clinica Hospital San Fernando, and Hospital Punta Pacifica.\nAbout 45% of the country's physicians are based in Panama City.\nTransportation.\nPanama's international airport, Tocumen International Airport is located on the eastern outskirts of the city's metropolitan area. Two other airports serve Panama City: Panam\u00e1 Pac\u00edfico, previously the Howard Air Force Base, and Marcos A. Gelabert, previously the Albrook Air Force Base. Pac\u00edfico serves Wingo, while Marcos A. Gelabert Airport is the main hub for AirPanama. Most other flights are served by Tocumen.\nThe Panama Metro is a rapid transit system in Panama City, which links the north and east sides of the metropolitan area to the city center. The Panama Metro currently has two operating lines. There is a third line currently under construction.\nThere are frequent traffic jams in Panama City due to the high levels of private transport ownership per kilometer of traffic lane. In an attempt to curb traffic jams, the Panama Metro, initially long and funded an increase in taxes, began operation in 2014.\nThe bus terminal located in Ancon offers buses in and out of the city. Bus service is one of the most widely used forms of transportation in Panama. The terminal receives thousands of passengers daily from locations like David, Chiriqui, and the central provinces of Herrera and Los Santos. The terminal also receives international passengers from Central America via the Pan-American Highway.\nPanama City offers transportation services through yellow taxis. Taxis do not use a meter to measure fares, instead using a zone system for fares that is published by the Autoridad de Transito y Transporte Terrestre, Panama's transit authority. Taxis used to be red. Taxi drivers that charge more than usual are not uncommon. Many also participate in InDriver and Cabify. Uber has been the subject of controversy, with many taxi drivers demanding its cessation of operations in Panama City.\nInternational relations.\nPanama City is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnion of Ibero-American Capital Cities.\nPanama City is part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The historic inner city of Paramaribo has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2002.\nName.\nThe city is named for the Paramaribo tribe living at the mouth of the Suriname River; the name is from Tupi\u2013Guarani \"para\" \"large river\" + \"maribo\" \"inhabitants\".\nHistory.\nThe name Paramaribo is probably a corruption of the name of a native village, spelled Parmurbo in the earliest Dutch sources. This was the location of the first Dutch settlement, a trading post established by Nicolaes Baliestel and Dirck Claeszoon van Sanen in 1613. English and French traders also tried to establish settlements in Suriname, including a French post established in 1644 near present-day Paramaribo.\nAll earlier settlements were abandoned some time before the arrival of English settlers in 1650 to found Surinam. They were sent by the English governor of Barbados, Lord Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham, and established a town on the site of Paramaribo (though probably south of the current town center). The town was protected by a fort, called Fort Willoughby. In 1662, Governor Willoughby was granted the settlement and surrounding lands (extending into Suriname's interior) by King Charles II. Around 1665 the village of Paramaribo was expanded and quickly outranked the earlier settlement of Torarica.\nIn 1667, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Paramaribo was conquered by a squadron of ships under Abraham Crijnssen. The Treaty of Breda in 1667 confirmed Paramaribo as the leading town of the now Dutch colony of Suriname. The fort protecting Paramaribo was renamed Fort Zeelandia in honor of the Dutch province that had financed Crijnssen's fleet. (The town was also renamed New Middelburg but the name did not catch on with the inhabitants).\nThe population of Paramaribo has always been very diverse. Among the first British settlers were many Jews and one of the oldest synagogues in the Americas, the Neveh Shalom Synagogue, is found in Paramaribo. The population of the town was greatly increased after 1873, when former enslaved people (who had been freed in 1863) were allowed to stop working for their former masters and leave the sugar plantations.\nParamaribo has remained the capital of Suriname, from its colonial days through the independence of Suriname in 1975 to the present day. The old town has suffered many devastating fires over the years, notably in January 1821 (which destroyed over 400 buildings) and September 1832 (which destroyed nearly 50 buildings). The slaves Kodjo, Mentor, and Present were found guilty of arson, and burnt alive.\nIn May 1972, the Paramaribo Zoo opened. In 1987, an administrative reorganization took place in Suriname and the city was divided into 12 administrative resorts (jurisdictions).\nGeography.\nThe city is located on the Suriname River, approximately inland from the Atlantic Ocean, in the Paramaribo district.\nClimate.\nParamaribo features a tropical rainforest climate (\"Af\"), under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Because Paramaribo is more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds and sees no tropical cyclones, its climate is classified as equatorial. The city has no true dry season; all 12 months of the year average more than of rainfall, but the city does experience noticeably wetter and drier periods during the year. The Northern Hemisphere \"autumn\" (September through November) is the driest period of the year in Paramaribo, and the heaviest rainfall occurs from April to July. Common to many cities with this climate, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course of the year, with average high temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius and average low temperatures of 24 degrees Celsius. Paramaribo on average receives roughly of rainfall each year.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nParamaribo has a population of 240,924 people (2012 census). While the population number is stagnating in recent years, many towns in the surrounding Wanica District are increasing in population.\nThe city is famed for its diverse ethnic makeup with 27% identifying as Creoles (African or mixed African-European descent), 23% as East Indian, 18% as Multiracial, 16% as Maroons (descendants of escaped enslaved Africans), 10% as Javanese, 2% as Indigenous, 1.5% as Chinese, and smaller numbers of Europeans (primarily of Dutch and Portuguese descent), Lebanese and Jews. In the past decades a significant number of Brazilians, Guyanese and new Chinese immigrants have settled in Paramaribo.\nEconomy.\nParamaribo is the business and financial centre of Suriname. Even though the capital city does not produce significant goods itself, almost all revenues from the country's main export products gold, oil, bauxite, rice, and tropical wood are channeled through its institutions. All banks, insurance corporations and other financial and commercial companies are headquartered in Paramaribo. Around 75 percent of Suriname's GDP is consumed in Paramaribo.\nTourism is an increasingly important sector, with most visitors coming from the Netherlands.\nGovernment.\nAdministratively, Paramaribo forms its own district in Suriname. The resorts of Paramaribo district therefore correspond to boroughs of the city. There are twelve resorts in the Paramaribo district:\nTransport.\nParamaribo is served by the Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport and Zorg en Hoop Airport for local flights. The Jules Wijdenbosch Bridge, which is part of the East-West Link, connects Paramaribo with Meerzorg on the other side of the Suriname River.\nThe Jules Sedney Harbour is the main harbour for cargo. The former harbour of Waterkant is used by ferries.\nMost airlines like Gum Air and Blue Wing Airlines have their head offices on the grounds of Zorg en Hoop Airport in Paramaribo.\nEducation.\nParamaribo's institution of higher learning is Anton de Kom University of Suriname, the country's only university.\nTeachers academy (Insituut voor de Opleiding van Leraren), the country's teachers academy to prepare teachers for secondary education levels.\nAlphaMax Academy is a private international school established on September 1, 1998, in Paramaribo, Republic of Suriname. The school is run by the Directors of the AlphaMax Foundation.\nHealthcare.\nParamaribo is home to four hospitals, the Academic Hospital Paramaribo, 's Lands Hospitaal, Sint Vincentius Hospital and Diakonessenhuis.\nHistoric inner city of Paramaribo.\nThe Dutch colonial town established in 17th and 18th centuries was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002. The historic inner city is located along the left bank of the Suriname River. The original architecture of buildings and street plan has largely remained intact and preserved.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nParamaribo is twinned with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Port Louis is the country's financial and political centre. It is administered by the Municipal City Council of Port Louis. According to the 2018 census conducted by Statistics Mauritius, the population was 147,066.\nHistory.\nPort Louis was used as a harbour by the Dutch settlers from 1606, when they started to refer to the area as \"Harbour of Tortoises\". In 1736, under French government, it became the administrative centre of Mauritius and a major reprovisioning halt for French ships during their passage between Asia and Europe, around the Cape of Good Hope. The port is named in honour of King Louis XV. During this period of French colonization, Mauritius was known as Ile de France. The French governor at that time, Bertrand-Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais, contributed to the development of the city. Since Port Louis was relatively well-protected from strong winds during cyclones by the Moka Mountain Range, Port Louis was selected to house both the main harbor and fort for the island. The value of the port continued during the British occupation of the island during the Napoleonic Wars (1800\u201315), and helped Britain control the Indian Ocean. However, port calls of ships fell drastically following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Activity in the port increased during the seven-year closure of the Suez Canal (starting in 1967). Modernization of the port in the late 1970s has helped it maintain its role as the central point for all imports and exports from Mauritius. While Port Louis continues to be the business and administrative capital of Mauritius, expansion of the tourism industry in the late 1990s led to considerable development in Port Louis, with many shops, hotels, and restaurants being built in the Caudan Waterfront area.\nRaouf Oderuth, the Mauritian Artist provides a 1930s scene depicting the waterfront when motorised transportation hardly existed. Place D'Armes is still recognisable despite high-rise buildings, heavy traffic jams, and crowds of pedestrians.\nGovernment.\nThe local governance of Port Louis is overseen by a municipal city council. The City Council of Port Louis was first established in 1830 and is currently one of five municipal councils responsible for the urban areas in Mauritius, as organized under Local Government Act 2011. The municipal city council has 32 members. The city is electorally divided into eight wards that each return four councillors. Councillors then elect a Lord Mayor and a Deputy Lord Mayor. Functions of the council are performed through Departments of Administration, Finance, Land Use and Planning, Public Infrastructure, Public Health, Welfare, Parks and Gardens, and the City Library. Services delivered by the local government include preschool, kindergarten, and vocational schools, health protection, housing regulation, road services, refuse collection, cemeteries, some environmental and consumer protection services, and economic promotion activities. Other services are provided to the city by the central government. These include police services through the Mauritius Police Force, which maintains two divisions responsible for the Port Louis area (Metropolitan Divisions North and South). There is also a specific Port Police, composed of the Harbour Police and Bulk Sugar Terminal Police. Their roles include providing security to cargo and facilities in the port area and enforcing laws related to harbour regulations, customs, quarantine, immigration, and drug trafficking.\nPort Louis is divided into different suburbs including but not limited to:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDuring the 2025 municipal elections, Alliance du Changement won 31 of the 32 council seats, while an independent secured one. Following the election, the council elected Aslam Hosenally of the Mauritian Militant Movement as lord mayor, who previously held the role from 2012 to 2013, and the Labour Party's Giovanni Lacl\u00e9 as deputy lord mayor.\nClimate.\nOwing to its location in the rain shadow of the southeast trade winds, Port Louis features a tropical savanna climate (\"Aw\") under K\u00f6ppen's climate classification. Its wettest months are from December through April where on average (or more) of rainfall occurs each month. The remaining months form Port Louis' dry season. The city also shows a noticeable but small range of average temperatures. Port Louis' coolest temperatures are seen mid-year where average high temperatures are around . During the height of the wet season, the city sees its highest temperatures where average high temperatures are usually around .\nEconomy.\nThe economy of the city is mostly dominated by its financial centre, port facilities, tourism, and the manufacturing sector which includes textiles, chemicals, plastics and pharmaceuticals. Port Louis is home to the biggest port facility in the Indian Ocean region and one of Africa's major financial centres.\nTourism has grown in Mauritius since the beginning of the 21st century. In 2009, 871,356 tourists arrived in Mauritius, and the number climbed to 934,827 in 2010. By 2018, 1,399,408 tourists arrived in Mauritius, and the number was about the same in 2019 at 1,383,488. Like all parts of the globe, tourism declined significantly both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Tourism in Mauritius has nearly recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels: in 2022, it was only at 997,290, but by 2023, 1,295,410 tourists visited.\nFinance industry.\nPort Louis is the financial centre of Mauritius, which has established itself as safe and trusted location for conducting business due to its strong democracy, political stability, and multilingual population. Located in Port Louis is the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Also in Port Louis are over ten commercial banks that serve both domestic and offshore clients, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, leasing companies, and foreign exchange dealers. The oldest bank based in Port Louis is the Mauritius Commercial Bank, which was founded in 1838. The Bank of Mauritius is the central bank of the country. Measuring from ground level to its pinnacle, the Bank of Mauritius Tower is the tallest building in the country.\nTransportation.\nPort Louis is served by two major bus stations. Victoria Station is used by buses to and from the eastern and southern areas and the Plaines Wilhems district. Immigration Square, also known as Gare du Nord, is a terminus for buses coming from the northern districts of Pamplemousses and Rivi\u00e8re du Rempart. A number of inter-city buses carry passengers to and from nearby suburbs such as Plaine Verte, Vall\u00e9e-des-Pr\u00eatres, Pailles, Plaine Lauzun, and Cit\u00e9 Vallijee. Most streets in Port Louis are laid out in rectangular grids, and many are one-way. Although most roads are in good shape, many streets are fairly narrow as would be expected for a historic colonial town. Due to the daily influx of workers to business and government offices in Port Louis, day-time traffic can be quite heavy and finding parking spaces a challenge. To cope with increasing traffic congestion, the government has proposed a light rail transit system. Other suggestions have included moving some of the 24 government ministries currently located in Port Louis to surrounding regions or introducing flexible work schedules.\nAn effort to move workers from the city centre has already started with the construction of the \u00c9b\u00e8ne office tower complex south of Port Louis. A ring road passing on the east side of Port Louis is also expected to reduce congestion. Phase 1 of that project was completed in 2013, but in February 2014 the road needed to be closed due to the appearance of a major crack, apparently due to faulty design.\nAnother project initiated to reduce congestion is the construction of a bridge (commonly referred to as the \"Dream Bridge\") from Les Salines to Roche-Bois, which will span the Port Louis harbour.\nLight rail transit system.\nIn 2012, the government decided to construct an approximately rail system between Curepipe and Port Louis, which had been under consideration for nearly three decades. The project was initiated by a government-to-government agreement with the Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SCE), along with private partners Singapore Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (SMRT) and the South African/Australian engineering firm Aurecon Ltd. The goal was to develop a preliminary plan of the system, and then solicit expressions of interest for a design-build-operate-finance scheme.\nConstruction for the light rail transit transport system began in the Fall of 2017, with the government of Mauritius awarding the contract to the Mumbai-based design and construction firm Larsen &amp; Toubro. The first stage of Mauritius Metro Express, from Port Louis to Rose Hill Central, was opened in January 2020, the second stage, an extension to Curepipe, in October 2022. \nPort.\nPort Louis is home to the nation's main harbour, which is the only official port of entry and exit for sea vessels in Mauritius. Ships must be cleared in the port before visiting any other anchorage in the island nation.\nThe Mauritius Ports Authority (MPA), established by law in 1998, is the port authority responsible for Port Louis. The MPA provides port infrastructure, enters into contracts with private providers for port and cargo-handling services, promotes the use and development of the ports, and licenses and regulates port and marine services. The harbour adjoins the main city, with the port currently comprising three terminals. Terminal I contains a total of of quay, with six berthing positions for cargo, passengers, and fishing boats. Terminal II contains of quays with six berthing positions and includes specialized facilities for handling and storing sugar, fish, tallow, and caustic soda. In particular, the Bulk Sugar Terminal (operated by the Mauritius Sugar Terminal Corporation) can handle vessels with up to of draft, can load sugar at a rate of 1450 tons per hour, and can store 175,000 tons of cargo. Also present in Terminal II is a dedicated cruise ship jetty, with a dredged depth of . Terminal III has two quays with a depth of , and is specialized for handling container ships, having three super-post-Panamax and five post-Panamax gantry cranes. Also present are storage facilities for bulk ethanol and tie-in points for reefer containers. Vessels too large to dock at the quays can anchor at the Outer Anchorage, which is still within the official boundaries of the port.\nThe number of ships visiting the port numbered over 2,200 annually in 2010. In 2019, cargo container capacity was 1 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units). Overall, the port contributes 2% to the country's GDP.\nThe cruise ship terminal, opened in 2010 and named after Christian Decotter (past chairman of the Mauritius Tourism Advisory Board), illustrates the increasing role of tourism in the economy of Mauritius. Cruise ships of up to can be accommodated at the facility, which includes two access bridges for passengers and vehicles. The facility was the first in the Indian Ocean to be capable of handling the largest cruise ships in the world. In 2012, passenger arrivals by sea included 11,510 tourists and 6,450 excursionists who arrived aboard 23 cruise ships.\nBerthing facilities are available at the Caudan Waterfront. Available are 20 berths with electrical and water connections, showers and toilets, laundry, and vehicle parking. Also available are dry dock and hull and sail repair facilities. Depths of the berths range from (depending on the tide); up to ships can be accommodated.\nAlso based in the port is the National Coast Guard facility, at Quay A of Terminal I.\nEducation.\nPort-Louis houses several secondary schools which include Alpha College, Bhujoharry College, Labourdonnais College, Port Louis Academy, Loreto College, Madad Ul Islam Girls College, Muslim Girls College, City College, Full Day School, Institute of Islamic and Secular Studies, London College, Ocep The Open College, and Port Louis High School, MEDCO Trinity Secondary School, MEDCO Trinity Secondary School, Port Louis North SSS, and Sir Abdool Razack Mohammed SSS, Goolam Mohammed Dawjee Atchia State College, MEDCO Cassis Secondary School, Renganaden Seeneevassen SSS, Port Louis SSS and Royal College Port Louis. The state also operates a vocational school for boys, Immaculee Conception SSV.\nThe major institute of tertiary education in Port Louis is the University of Technology, Mauritius, a public university with a technology focus. The \u00c9cole de Medecine Louis Pasteur prepares students for medical studies at Universit\u00e9 de Lille in France. Several technical schools also have locations in the city, including the Jhurry Rya School which specializes in information technology, Appavoo Business School, Apollo Bramwell Nursing School, BSP School of Accountancy &amp; Management, and the London College of Accountancy.\nArchitecture.\nThe city is full of numerous buildings and monuments that reflect its rich and diverse colonial history. Near the city centre, there are several French colonial buildings that date to the 18th century, including the Government House. Other prominent traditional elements include the Jummah Mosque, the majestic English Saint James Cathedral, the Indian Tamil Temple, the elegant five-tier colonial Port Louis Theatre (Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Port-Louis), the Champ de Mars Racecourse, and the nearby Chinese Pagoda. Also present are some typical houses from past eras, which are mostly wooden structures with shuttered windows and large porches. However, many historic buildings are in a poor state of repair and are being quickly replaced with homes and commercial structures constructed from more durable but less sustainable materials such as concrete, and the city now includes many glass/concrete high-rises.\nChinatown.\nThe Pagoda is a central feature of the Port Louis Chinatown, which is one of several Chinatowns in Africa. Its entrance is marked by a large \"friendship\" gate, just east of the Central Market. The site was the traditional location of homes and shops of the Chinese community, which was dominated by descendants of the Hakka Chinese, who first came to Mauritius in 1826.\nChinatown is now home to a more diverse community, but preserves its original appearance and contains many small shops and restaurants. Its old buildings and Chinese pagodas face the modern buildings of the city's business centre. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce (founded in 1908 and second only to Singapore as the world's oldest) hosts a popular food and cultural festival each April or May. The Chamber also runs a funeral parlour for the Chinese Community called 'Kit Lok', to provide vigil facilities for bereaved families.\nCulture.\nPort Louis has been an active cultural city attracting painters, poets, sculptors, and writers for centuries. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Humbert wrote her famous novel, \"La Montagne des Signaux\", with Port-Louis in mind. Malcolm de Chazal was a common Mauritian visionary writer and painter who was often seen in the capital, mostly at the central market, Champ de Mars and l'h\u00f4tel National. Robert Edouard-Hart, a great poet found in this very active city a source of inspiration. Port-Louis-born poet and semiologist Khal Torabully, the foremost poet of indenture and coolitude, recently designed Travellers' Lane at the Jardin de la Compagnie, inaugurated by Navin Ramgoolam, the Mauritian Prime Minister and the Parcours Culturel with aphorisms of Malcolm de Chazal, just facing the famous Port Louis Theatre. That theater, still in use and catering mostly to presentations of classical music, jazz, and local drama, has a distinguished history that includes the first presentation of opera on the island in the 19th century by travelling European troupes.\nMore modern entertainment facilities in Port Louis include several cinemas, in which most films are presented in French and English. Recently opened in Paille, a suburb of Port Louis, is the ultra-modern Swami Vivekananda International Convention Centre. It is the first such facility in Mauritius and is used to house conventions, concerts, trade shows, and exhibitions. \nEnglish is currently the official language of Port Louis and Mauritius.\nMuseums.\nThe Blue Penny Museum is located at the Caudan Waterfront, and is dedicated to the history and art of the island. Its collection includes antique marine maps, paintings, sculptures, engravings, and stamps, including examples of the famous orange-red one penny and deep blue two-pence stamps.\nThe Natural History Museum of Port Louis houses exhibits of the impressive fauna of Mauritius, with a gallery devoted to birds and terrestrial animals, a second focusing on marine species, and a third focused on the dodo, the famous Mauritian bird which became extinct during the Dutch occupation.\nThe Mauritius Postal Museum is housed in an old stone building that dates to the 18th century, and houses displays of stamps and postal paraphernalia from Mauritius and around the world. The Mauritius Photography Museum, located in a small 18th-century white-washed French colonial building, is a private museum that displays artifacts and documents about Mauritian photography and the early days of cinematography.\nLocated in the Ex-Military Hospital, the deals with the history of the slave trade, slavery and indentured labour. It also houses a documentation centre. The Aapravasi Ghat is the remains of the immigration depot that was built by the British Government to import labourers from India, Eastern Africa, Madagascar, China, and Southeast Asia to work on the island's sugar estates. Although not a museum in a traditional sense, the National Library of Mauritius houses a rich and comprehensive collection of material related to Mauritius history, including manuscripts, books, newspapers, periodicals, music scores, photographs, maps, drawings, and other graphic art forms and audiovisual materials, in addition to providing the traditional services of a library to residents of the city and nation.\nPlaces of worship.\nThe most common places of worship in Mauritius are Hindu temples. There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Diocese of Port-Louis (Catholic Church), Church of the Province of the Indian Ocean (Anglican Communion), Assemblies of God and Muslim mosques.\nSports.\nSports are popular among the inhabitants of Port Louis, as in the rest of Mauritius. Over 35 sports federations are organized under the aegis of the Mauritius Sports Council. Popular activities include football, volleyball, a range of martial arts (Karate, Taekwon Do, Wushu), table tennis, badminton, and p\u00e9tanque, which is a form of boules. The Mauritius National Olympic committee is also based in Port Louis. Public sports facilities in Port Louis include St. Fran\u00e7ois Xavier stadium, which is used for football. There is however a general dearth of public facilities in Port Louis proper, with most being built in the surrounding less-densely inhabited suburbs and districts.\nFootball clubs are organized nationwide by the Mauritius Football Association, which currently has ten teams in its Premier League. This includes the Port Louis team, named the Association Sportive Port-Louis 2000 (AS Port-Louis 2000), which won the national championship in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2011.\nAnother popular sports activity in Port Louis is the Thoroughbred horse races held at the Champ de Mars Racecourse, which is the second oldest horse race track in the world. Gambling on the horse races can be done both with bookies and the tote, available at multiple locations inside the grandstand.\nGambling, in general, is a popular \"sport\" in Port Louis. Besides the racecourse, within Port Louis gambling can be done in four casinos that offer table games plus gaming, slot, and video poker machines. Port Louis includes the largest casino in the entire country of Mauritius, the Caudan Waterfront Casino at Labourdonnais Waterfront Hotel. Other casinos are the Le Grand Casino du Domaine, L'Amicale Casino, and the Senator Club.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nPort Louis is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the largest cities in the southwestern Pacific (along with Jayapura) outside of Australia and New Zealand. It is located on the shores of the Gulf of Papua, on the south-western coast of the Papuan Peninsula of the island of New Guinea. The city emerged as a trade centre in the second half of the 19th century. During World War II, it was a prime objective for conquest by the Imperial Japanese forces during 1942\u201343 as a staging point and air base to cut off Australia from Southeast Asia and the Americas. Due to its population and outsized influence compared to other cities in Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby may be regarded as a primate city.\nAs of the 2011 census, Port Moresby had 364,145 inhabitants. An unofficial 2020 estimate gives the population as 383,000. The place where the city was founded has been inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu people for centuries. The first Briton to see it was Royal Navy Captain John Moresby in 1873. It was named in honour of his father, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby.\nAlthough Port Moresby is surrounded by Central Province, of which it is also the capital, it is not part of that province but instead forms the National Capital District. The traditional landowners, the Motu and Koitabu people, are represented by the Motu Koita Assembly.\nPort Moresby hosted the APEC summit in November 2018. However, there were concerns about security, given the capital's reputation for violent crime.\nHistory.\nDiscovery by Europeans.\nIn February 1873, the territory was discovered by the crew of HMS \"Basilisk\", surveying the southern shore of New Guinea. Captain John Moresby named the harbour in honour of his father Fairfax Moresby and called the anchorage off Paga Hill \"Port Moresby\" on his charts. Europeans estimated the local population to be around 2000 people. The largest settlement, Hanuabada, consisted of five villages, populated by Motu and Koita people. The Motu were originally coastal dwellers, while the Koita came from the hills inland. There was significant intermarriage between these two groups. They were organised into units called \"iduhu\", which are somewhat similar to clans.\nIn November 1873, four Polynesian teachers were sent to Port Moresby by the Reverend Samuel Macfarlane of the London Missionary Society. In November 1874, they were joined by the Reverend William George Lawes, who immediately built a mission house at Metoreia, opposite Elevala Island. Port Moresby was an important centre of trade, visited by distant tribes of New Guinea, which the missionaries hoped would help them reach more people.\nIn September 1877, a Pacific Islander working for the naturalist and collector Andrew Goldie found signs of gold at the junction of the Laloki and Goldie Rivers, within walking distance of Port Moresby. Anticipating a gold rush, entrepreneur William Bairstow Ingham set off from Cooktown in January 1878 to set up a store at Port Moresby. Around 100 miners arrived since April, but most of them left by the end of the year, finding no gold and suffering from diseases.\nColonisation.\nIn March 1883, Sir Thomas McIlwraith, the Premier of Queensland, heard the story that German SMS \"Carola\" was about to leave Sydney for the South Seas \"with object of annexation\". On 20 March, he ordered Henry Chester, the police magistrate at Thursday Island, to sail for New Guinea and \"take formal possession in Her Majesty's name of whole of the Island with exception of that portion in occupation of the Dutch\". On 4 April, the Union Jack was raised at Port Moresby, and Chester read his proclamation in the presence of thirteen Europeans and about 200 Papuans.\nThe annexation was rejected by the imperial authorities, which expected the Australian colonies to share the expenses jointly. In May 1884, the Earl of Derby requested the colonies to provide \u00a315,000 annually for the administration of New Guinea, which they agreed. On 10 October, Commodore James Erskine was cabled orders to proclaim the protectorate over the south-eastern coast of New Guinea. Deputy Commissioner for the Western Pacific Hugh Romilly, who also received a telegram from Lord Derby, proclaimed the protectorate in a short statement at Port Moresby on 23 October. Unknown to him, Erskine was also on his way to the island. Commodore held a grand ceremony of his own on 6 November, leaving Romilly in charge of the protectorate.\nSpecial Commissioner Peter Scratchley arrived at Port Moresby in August 1885, choosing the site as a location for the colonial capital. In September, a plot of land to the south from Hanuabada was purchased for the government bungalow. Twenty-eight locals were paid a tomahawk, a handkerchief and half a pound of tobacco each.\nThe administration began the policy of segregating non-indigenous residential areas, which continued until the early 1960s, and built a two-mile fence around the government land. In 1886, surveyor Walter Cuthbertson laid out a gridiron plan for townships Granville West, extending between the harbour and Ela Beach, and Granville East, to the south from the government bungalow. However, the settlement continued to be referred to as Port Moresby. Special Commissioner John Douglas wrote in 1887: \"Granville West has assumed the appearance of a small township. Mr. Goldie\u2019s store is finished, and so are the Government Buildings, including the accommodation house, the customs house and post office, which at present does duty as a store, as well as the building erected.\"\nAfter 1888 annexation, urban development continued to be concentrated on the saddle between Paga and Tuaguba hills. There were about twenty residential buildings in 1897. Granville East was practically undeveloped, with a single house at the top of Lawes Road until the late 1920s.\nIn 1905, the recently federated Australian government passed the Papua Act which came into effect in 1906. The act transferred Papua, with Port Moresby as its capital, to direct Australian rule. From then until 1941 Port Moresby grew slowly. The main growth was on the peninsula, where port facilities and other services were gradually improved. The first butcher's shop and grocery opened in 1909. By 1912, Port Moresby was linked by radio to Thursday Island. From 1921 to 1925, Papua was under the effect of the Commonwealth Navigation Act, which practically restricted trade to a single company, Burns Philp, and a single port, Sydney. Electricity was introduced in 1925. In the early 1930s, regular air service was established between Kila Airfield and Sydney. Piped water supply was provided in 1941.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, some Papuan men enlisted in the Papua Infantry Battalion and others as carriers over trails and rough terrains (porters) as supply support to Allied and Japanese armies during long jungle marches. Historian William Manchester outlines in his biography of General Douglas MacArthur, \"American Caesar\", that acting as porters was well down the natives' list of acceptable voluntary activities and that they would fade away without great inducements. Many Papuan residents of Port Moresby either returned to their family villages or were evacuated to camps when the threat of Japanese invasion loomed. By September 1942, the city was an important Allied complex of bases, and thousands of troops were stationed in the area or more often, staged through it, as it was the last Allied bastion on the island and, conversely, a key staging and jumping off point as the Allies began conducting offensive warfare themselves, pushing back the Japanese advances. General MacArthur located his headquarters in Port Moresby from November 1942 to October 1944.\nIn 1945, the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was formed when Papua and the former German New Guinea, which had been administered by Australia since 1918, were amalgamated under a single Australian administration though several laws remained in two territories and remain so, which can be complicating with provinces sitting on two sides of the otherwise extinct boundary. Port Moresby became the capital of the new combined territory and a focal point for the expansion of public services. Port Moresby was granted city status in 1972, with Oala Oala-Rarua becoming the first Lord Mayor.\nIndependence.\nIn September 1975, Papua New Guinea became an independent country with Port Moresby as its capital city. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, represented the Queen of Papua New Guinea at the celebrations. New government, intellectual and cultural buildings were constructed in the suburb of Waigani to supplement and replace those of downtown Port Moresby. They included those for government departments, including a National Parliament Building, which was opened in 1984 by Prince Charles and blends traditional design with modern building technology.\nThe Papua New Guinea National Museum and National Library are in Waigani. A mansion was built in Port Moresby just west of the old legislative building but the last pre-independence chief minister and first prime minister of the sovereign state declared it not nearly grand enough; it was made the residence of Australian high commissioners and a mansion suitable to Somare's demands was built in Waigani.\nSeveral of the government buildings have been abandoned due to long-term neglect. Chief amongst these are Marea Haus (known to most locals as the \"Pineapple Building\") and the Central Government Offices. However, widespread restoration rather than demolition of long-disused office buildings has been highly active since the first decade of the 21st century. The legislative building before independence and the first parliament building is long-gone but the old court house in town Port Moresby remains, bearing its pre-independence label with its previous title.\nThe population of the Port Moresby area expanded rapidly after independence. In 1980, the census return registered a population of 120,000; by 1990, this had increased to 195,000.\nClimate.\nMoresby has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Aw\") with relatively constant temperatures throughout the year. Port Moresby's average yearly rainfall is , making it the driest place in New Guinea.\nThe wet season starts in December and ends in May; the dry season covers the remaining six months. This is due to the south-easterly trade winds running parallel to the coast, and the city being surrounded by high mountains. The average high temperatures range from depending on time of year, while the average low temperature shows very little seasonal variation, hovering around the mark. It tends to be slightly cooler in the city during the dry season.\nDistrict, LLGs and suburbs.\nPort Moresby is the single district of the National Capital District, which contains three Local Level Government (LLG) areas. For census purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards and those into census units.\nThe National Capital District machinery of government also incorporates the Motu Koita Assembly, established by an act of parliament to represent the traditional landowners of Port Moresby, the Motu and Koitabu people. The Assembly governs the traditional lands and inhabitants of the ten recognised villages, and is the only entity of its kind in Papua New Guinea. The Chair of the Motu Koita Assembly also holds the position of Deputy Governor of the National Capital District.\nPort Moresby refers to both the urbanised area of the National Capital District and more specifically to the main business area, known locally as \"Town\".\nSince the 1990s the original town centre has ceased to have restaurants and night life, though it is very successful and prosperous-looking as an office centre. The affluent housing region north of downtown along and up from the coast remains so, though there are now few modest residential houses, most of which are replaced with substantial mansions and apartment buildings.\nThe suburb of Boroko, once the commercial heart of Port Moresby, is very idle, with many former shopping buildings now empty; the west is full of high rises, shopping centres and affluent housing. Other neighbourhoods of Port Moresby include Koki, with its popular fresh produce market, Newtown, Konedobu, Kaevaga, Badili, Gabutu, Kila Kila, Matirogo, Three Mile, Kaugere, Sabama, Korobosea, Four Mile, Hohola, Hohola North, Boroko, Gordons, Gordons North, Erima, Saraga, Waigani, Morata and Gerehu.\nVillages.\nVillages within Port Moresby include:\nCrime.\n\"Al Jazeera\" describes Port Moresby as \"one of the most dangerous cities in the world\". \"ABC Australia\" reports that \"many homes have big fences covered in metal sheeting, locked gates and internal steel security doors.\"\nTravel by foot is not recommended in and about the city and suburbs due to continuing breakdown in law and order. The UN Global Compact Cities Programme, using a method called Circles of Sustainability, has assessed the urban security of Port Moresby as 'critical'.\nTransport.\nPort Moresby is served within the city by buses and privately owned taxis. Flights are vital for transport about the country, highways not being widely available. Port Moresby is served by Jacksons International Airport, the biggest international airport and Papua New Guinea Defence Force Air Wing base in the country.\nAs the national highway system is not fully linked, there are many internal flights to other towns, such as Lae and Madang, which have no direct road connection to Port Moresby.\nEconomy.\nPapua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, which account for two thirds of its export earnings. Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of development led foreign countries to take over some sites. Continuing foreign demand for PNG's resources led the United States to set up an oil company that began to export in 2004. This was the largest project in PNG's history. The project increased the potential to triple PNG's export revenue. Papua New Guinea gained much assistance from Australia and was offered two hundred million dollars a year in aid, and many countries such as Singapore, Japan and China have also played a great part in PNG's industry business. The decision to host the 2018 APEC meeting, brought a large number of world leaders to Port Moresby.\nThere has been substantial building of housing, office towers, shopping malls and commercial establishments over much of the city. The waterfront area has been completely redeveloped with apartments, restaurants and shopping centres. Sporting facilities were upgraded significantly for the 2015 Pacific Games, and further development took place in preparation for the 2016 FIFA Under-20 Women's World Cup.\nAir Niugini, the national airline of Papua New Guinea, and Airlines PNG, the second biggest airline in the country, have their head offices on the grounds of Jacksons International Airport.\nSports.\nThe 1969 South Pacific Games, held from 13 to 23 August 1969 at Port Moresby, were the third South Pacific Games to be held. A total of 1,150 athletes participated.\nThe 1991 South Pacific Games held from 7\u201321 September 1991 at Port Moresby and along Lae were the ninth South Pacific Games to be held. This was the first time that events at one games had been held in two cities. The decision to do so was to allow both locations to benefit from the construction of new facilities.\nCricket PNG is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Papua New Guinea. Its headquarters is in Port Moresby. Cricket PNG is Papua New Guinea's representative at the International Cricket Council and is an associate member and has been a member of that body since 1973. It is also a member of the East Asia-Pacific Cricket Council.\nThe city hosted the 2017 FIBA Melanesia Basketball Cup, where the Papua New Guinea national basketball team won the gold medal.\nThe city is home to the Port Moresby Vipers rugby league team who play in the Papua New Guinea National Rugby League. The National football stadium is also home to the PNG Hunters, a rugby league team that compete in the majority Australian Queensland Cup.\n2015 Pacific Games.\nThe 2015 Pacific Games were held in Port Moresby from 4 to 18 July 2015. In September 2009, the Pacific Games Council, at its meeting coinciding with the 2009 Pacific Mini Games, elected Port Moresby as the host of the 2015 Games. The final vote was 25\u201322 in favour of Port Moresby over Tonga.\nThe 2015 Pacific Games involved 24 countries from the Pacific regions competing in 28 sports events, including: basketball, soccer, touch rugby, table tennis, weightlifting, triathlon, swimming, cricket, squash, shooting, sailing, va'a, rugby 7s, powerlifting, rugby league 9s, volleyball, beach volleyball, athletics, hockey, netball, karate, lawn bowls, bodybuilding, boxing, softball, taekwondo, golf, and canoeing. Papua New Guinea ranked first with the most medals followed by New Caledonia and Tahiti.\nThe opening ceremony took place on 4 July 2015 involving various traditional dances. The closing ceremony involved singers such as J Boog, Fiji, O-Shen and George Mamua Telek.\nSports venues.\nThe venue has hosted the PNG national side since 1975 and has previously hosted Rugby League World Cup matches in 1986 and 1990. It is also home of the Hunters, the local Papua New Guinea team who play in the Intrust Super Cup which is the Queensland NRL tournament.\nThe National Football Stadium features a permanent main grandstand with seating for 3,000 including a roof and corporate facilities while temporary stands around the ground boost the seating capacity. There are also lights and a video screen.\nEducation.\nInternational schools.\nThe International Education Agency provides private education via six international schools; Korobosea International School, Boroko International School, Ela Murray International School, Gordon International School, Port Moresby International School and IEA TAFE college. There are approximately 300 staff.\nThe Port Moresby International School (POMIS) has been operating since the 1950s. It is an International Education Agency school and is the premier international high school in Port Moresby. It enrolls nearly 1,000 students from Grades 7 to 12.\nPort Moresby Japanese Language School (\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30e2\u30ec\u30b9\u30d3\u30fc\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821 \"P\u014dto Moresub\u012b Hosh\u016b Jugy\u014d K\u014d\") was a supplementary Japanese school in the city. It closed in August 2009.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nPort Moresby is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is on the island of Efate, in Shefa Province.\nThe population was 49,034 as of the 2020 census. This represented 16.3% of Vanuatu's total population in 2020.\nLocated on the east coast of the island of Efate, Port Vila is the economic and commercial centre of Vanuatu. The mayor is Jenny Regenvanu of the Land and Justice Party, the first woman to hold the position, elected in August 2024. Her deputy was Marie Louise Milne, of the Green Confederation, until the seat was vacated in January 2025.\nName.\nLocally, the town is most commonly referred to simply as \"Vila\", whether in French or Bislama or in English (not like English \"villa\").\nThe name of the area is in the native South Efate language and in neighbouring Mele-Fila language. \"Vila\" is a variant of these names. Ifira is a small island in Vila Harbour where many traditional landowners reside.\nHistory.\nMelanesian people have occupied the Port Vila area for thousands of years. In the autumn of 2004, an archaeological expedition known as \"Teouma\" discovered a burial site of 25 tombs containing three dozen skeletons of members of the Lapita culture. Pieces of ceramics found at the site were dated to the 13th century BC.\nEfate Island was charted in 1774 by James Cook, who named it Sandwich Island. Cook's expedition did not land but noted the presence of good harbours and land suitable for European settlement. In the late 19th century, when the islands were known as the New Hebrides, the British initially had the dominant European presence. However, by the 1890s, the economic balance had begun favouring the French, who established large plantations. French citizen Ferdinand Chevillard began buying and clearing land around Port Vila to be converted into the largest French plantation on the island. Instead, it was converted into the municipality of Franceville, which declared independence on 9 August 1889, though this only lasted until June of the following year.\nAfter 1887, the territory was jointly administered by the French and the British. This was formalized in 1906 as an Anglo-French Condominium. During World War II, Port Vila was an American and Australian airbase.\nIn 1987, Cyclone Uma severely damaged the city. A powerful earthquake on 3 January 2002 caused minor damage in the capital and surrounding areas.\nThe city suffered massive damage from a category 5 cyclone named Cyclone Pam on 13 March 2015, whose eye wall passed just to the east of Port Vila. On 17 December 2024, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake reportedly damaged almost every single house in Port Vila, resulting in 16 fatalities. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 116,000 people had been directly affected by the earthquake, equivalent to a third of Vanuatu's population.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nPort Vila has a tropical climate, more specifically a tropical rainforest climate, with noticeably wetter and drier months. As the trade winds are almost permanent and cyclones are not rare in Port Vila, the climate is not equatorial but maritime trade-wind tropical climate. Rainfall averages about per year, and the wettest month is March. The driest month is September. There are 153 wet days in an average year. The area also has south-east trade winds. Temperatures do not vary much throughout the year, and the record high is . The coolest month, July, has an average high of , and an average low of . The hottest month, February, has an average high of and an average low of . The record low for Port Vila is . Humidity is often high.\nEconomy and transport.\nPort Vila is Vanuatu's most important harbour and the center of the country's trade. The international airport, Bauerfield International (VLI), is also located in the city. Air Vanuatu has its head office in Vanuatu House in Port Vila.\nMajor industries in the city remain agriculture and fishing. Tourism is also becoming important, especially from Australia and New Zealand. There were over 80,000 visitors in 1997.\nVanuatu is a tax haven, and offshore financing in Port Vila is an important part of the economy.\nVanuatu is still dependent on foreign aid, most of which comes from Australia and New Zealand, although in recent years, assistance has also come from China. One example was New Zealand paying to train doctors selected from the local community, then paying part of their wages during the first year after qualification. Australia has paid consultants to work in Port Vila Central Hospital.\n35.7% of exports leave from Port Vila, and 86.9% of imports arrive in Port Vila.\nPopulation.\nDemographics.\nThe population is around 45,000; predominately Melanesian, with small Polynesian, Asian, Australian and European populations, mainly French and British.\nLanguages.\nPort Vila is home to many languages, reflecting the country's high linguistic diversity.\nThe capital city's daily lingua franca is Bislama, but English and French are also widely spoken.\nAmong Vanuatu's 100 indigenous languages, many are spoken in the capital, as people from rural areas come to live in the city, either temporarily or permanently.\nReligion.\nChristianity is the predominant religion across Vanuatu, followed by more than 90% of the population. The largest denomination is the Presbyterian Church in Vanuatu, followed by one-third of the population. Roman Catholicism and the Church of Melanesia are also common, each about 15%. Cath\u00e9drale du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur is a modern Roman Catholic cathedral in Port Vila. The seat of the Diocese of Port Vila, the church is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. On October 5, 2020, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints announced plans to construct a temple in the city, and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith community is also established in Port Vila.\nCulture and education.\nHighlights of the city.\nThe capital of Vanuatu has various sights to offer. There are several memorials, e.g., opposite the Parliament, where two traditional totem poles and a monument representing a pig's tusk can be seen. The Presbyterian Church of Port Vila is an impressive and sightworthy building opposite the Independence Park. A colourful wall painting can be seen on the administration building opposite the market hall. Another noteworthy wall painting is on the fa\u00e7ade of the post office. The City Hall of Port Vila is an oblong and sightworthy building on a hill in the city centre.\nVanuatu Cultural Centre.\nThe Vanuatu Cultural Centre, hosting the Vanuatu National Museum, is located at the Saralana Park in front of the National Parliament, close to the National Library and the Malvatumauri (Vanuatu National Council of Chiefs). This institution is an important place to preserve and promote the different aspects of the local culture. Traditional artifacts from several islands are on display in the museum. The centre also hosts the National Audiovisual Archives, the most critical fund of documents from the late 19th century until today.\nWorld Heritage.\nPort Vila was the location in August 1999 for the \"2nd World Heritage Global Strategy Meeting for the Pacific Islands Region\" held by UNESCO. One of the major topics related to Vanuatu and the Pacific region was the question of the suitability of underwater heritage for inscription on the World Heritage List.\nEducation.\nPort Vila is one location of the University of the South Pacific, an educational institution co-owned by twelve Pacific countries. The Vanuatu campus is the only law school in the university and teaches languages.\nUpper secondary (sixth form/senior high school) institutions include:\nJunior secondary (seventh form to tenth form) institutions include:\nSport.\nFootball.\nLike in the rest of Vanuatu, association football (also known as \"soccer\") is the most popular sport in Port Vila, though like in the rest of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) the sport is not professional in Vanuatu.\nThe Port Vila Football League (PVFL) is the local men's football league in Port Vila. The league has three divisions: the Premier League (PVPL), the First Division (PVFD) and the Second Division (PVSD). Teams from the city have also competed in the VFF Champions League (VFFCL), the national men's football league of Vanuatu, though teams from the Port Vila Football Federation (PVFF, the city's football federation) no longer compete and thus nowadays the only team from Greater Vanuatu in the league is Ifira Black Bird. However, women's teams from Port Vila do compete in the VFF Women's Champions League (VFFWCL), the women's equivalent of the VFFCL that began in 2023.\nThe bulk of Vanuatu's footballing success has always been in Port Vila. Only two Vanuatuan teams, both from Port Vila, have reached the final of the OFC Men's Champions League (OFCMCL), with Tafea FC having done so in 2001 and Amicale FC having done so in 2011 and 2014, though neither club was successful. Indeed, Tafea FC is Vanuatu's most successful football club, with the club having won the PVPL 16 times including all of the first 15 seasons from 1994 to 2008\u201309, which to this day is the world record for the most domestic league titles in a row. The club would then go without a league title until 2018\u201319, when the club won its first league title in 10 years. The club has also won the VFFCL (then the Vanuatu National Soccer League (VNSL)) four times.\nInstitutions.\nMunicipality.\nThe municipality of Port Vila is divided into four wards and administered by a council of 14 members. The four wards are:\nMalapoa-Tagabe and South are allotted three representatives each to the council, while Anabrou-Melcofe-Tassiriki and Centre have four.\nThe municipality handles primary education, primary health care, regional planning, road maintenance and construction, trash collection, cemeteries, parks and open spaces, and tourism promotion.\nThere are also informal settlements such as Blacksands, which are effectively Vila suburbs but outside the municipality. Living conditions in some of these neighbourhoods are deplorable. Lack of service provision and insecure land tenure are major problems. Blacksands was squatted in the 1960s.\nThe most recent municipal council election was held in 2022.\nPolitics.\nMayoralty and council.\nThe local council is the Port Vila City Council (PVCC). Port Vila is the only city in Vanuatu with a lord mayor (or lady mayor). The current Lady Mayor is Jenny Regenvanu of the Land and Justice Party (GJP), the first woman to hold the position after she was elected in 2024.\nConstituency.\nPort Vila is one of the eighteen constituencies in Vanuatu and elects five Members of Parliament. Following the 2025 general election, its representatives are:\nElection results.\nTraditionally, the centre-right Union of Moderate Parties (UMP) and the centre-left Vanua'aku Pati are the two major political parties in Port Vila.\nInitially a competitive city, Port Vila began to lean heavily to the UMP in the late 1980s, with the UMP having won the majority of votes in the city in 1987 and a plurality in 1991. In 1991, the centre-left National United Party (NUP) emerged as a third party, but were unsuccessful in overtaking the UMP and Vanua'aku. In 1995, Vanua'aku regained the plurality of votes in Port Vila and won a majority of seats in the city.\nAfter the late 1990s, MMP and Vanua'aku's vote shares began dropping and the vote for minor parties and independents surged, a trend that only continued further into the 2000s. However, due to Vanuatu's electoral system, Vanua'aku and the UMP continued to sometimes receive a plurality of seats in Port Vila. In 2008, for the first time since the party was founded, the UMP won no seats in Port Vila after a record low vote share of just 7.90%.\nBy the 2010s and 2020s, the UMP vote had begun recovering despite Vanua'aku's vote continuing to drop (reaching a record low of 6.15% in 2020), with the UMP regularly emerging as the party with the most seats in the city. In 2025, UMP candidates won a combined total of 26.24% of the vote, the party's highest vote share in Port Vila since 1995.\nTransportation.\nPort Vila is served by Bauerfield International Airport, with service on many passenger and cargo airlines, including several foreign ones. \nIn May 2024, state-owned Air Vanuatu entered liquidation, resulting in short-term cancellations and schedule disruptions. Capacity on routes to Australia was subsequently restored and expanded by other carriers, including Qantas (Brisbane\u2013Port Vila from 1\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nPort Vila is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city's population was estimated at 1,200,000 in 2022 with the metropolitan area estimated at a population of 2,618,894. The metropolitan area is defined by the IHSI as including the communes of Port-au-Prince, Delmas, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Tabarre, Carrefour, and P\u00e9tion-Ville.\nThe city of Port-au-Prince is on the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve: the bay on which the city lies, which acts as a natural harbor, has sustained economic activity since the civilizations of the Ta\u00edno. It was first incorporated under French colonial rule in 1749. The city's layout is similar to that of an amphitheater; commercial districts are near the water, while residential neighborhoods are located on the hills above. Its population is difficult to ascertain due to the rapid growth of slums in the hillsides above the city; however, recent estimates place the metropolitan area's population at around 3.7 million, nearly a third of the country's national population. The city was catastrophically affected by a massive earthquake in 2010, with large numbers of structures damaged or destroyed. Haiti's government estimated the death toll to be 230,000. Gang violence is extensive, and kidnappings, massacres, and gang rapes are common occurrences, often with the complicity of police officers and politicians.\nEtymology.\n literally means \"Prince's Port\", but it is unclear which prince was the honoree.\nA theory is that the place is named after \"Le Prince\", a ship captained by de Saint-Andr\u00e9 which arrived in the area in 1706.\nHowever, the islets in the bay had already been known as as early as 1680, predating the ship's arrival.\nFurthermore, the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as , named after the filibusters' hospital.\nFrench colonial commissioner \u00c9tienne Polverel named the city \"Port-R\u00e9publicain\" on 23 September 1793 \"in order that the inhabitants be kept continually in mind of the obligations which the French Revolution imposed on them\". It was later renamed back to Port-au-Prince by Jacques I, Emperor of Haiti.\nWhen Haiti was divided between a kingdom in the north and a republic in the south, Port-au-Prince was the capital of the republic, under the leadership of Alexandre P\u00e9tion. Henri Christophe renamed the city \"Port-aux-Crimes\" after the assassination of Jacques I at Pont Larnage (now known as Pont-Rouge, and located north of the city).\nHistory.\nTaino Period.\nThe Port-au-Prince area was part of the Xaragua chiefdom with the capital city, Yaguana being in L\u00e9oganes. There were multiple Taino settlements in the area such as Bohoma and Guahaba. It is understood that most of the plain area was used as hunting grounds.\nThe Bahoruco mountain range in the north-east of Port-au-Prince was the scene of a Taino rebellion led by Enriquillo resulting in a treaty with the Spanish.\nSpanish colonization.\nPrior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus, the island of Hispaniola was inhabited by the Ta\u00edno people, who arrived in approximately 2600\u00a0BC in large dugout canoes. They are believed to come primarily from what is now eastern Venezuela. By the time Columbus arrived in 1492\u00a0AD, the region was under the control of Bohechio, Ta\u00edno cacique (chief) Xaragua. He, like his predecessors, feared settling too close to the coast; such settlements would have proven to be tempting targets for the Caribs, who lived on neighboring islands. Instead, the region served as a hunting ground. The population of the region was approximately 400,000 at the time, but the Ta\u00ednos were gone within 30 years of the arrival of the Spaniards.\nWith the arrival of the Spaniards, the Amerindians were forced to accept a protectorate, and Bohechio, childless at death, was succeeded by his sister, Anacaona, wife of the cacique Caonabo. The Spanish insisted on larger tributes. Eventually, the Spanish colonial administration decided to rule directly, and in 1503, Nicolas Ovando, then governor, set about to put an end to the r\u00e9gime headed by Anacaona. He invited her and other tribal leaders to a feast, and when the Amerindians had drunk a good deal of wine (the Spaniards did not drink on that occasion), he ordered most of the guests killed. Anacaona was spared, only to be hanged publicly some time later. Through violence, introduced diseases and murders, the Spanish settlers decimated the native population.\nDirect Spanish rule over the area having been established, Ovando founded a settlement not far from the coast (west of Etang Saum\u00e2tre), ironically named \"Santa Maria de la Paz Verdadera\", which would be abandoned several years later. Not long thereafter, Ovando founded \"Santa Maria del Puerto\". The latter was first burned by French explorers in 1535, then again in 1592 by the English. These assaults proved to be too much for the Spanish colonial administration, and in 1606, it decided to abandon the region.\nDomination of the filibustiers.\nFor more than 50 years, the area that is today Port-au-Prince saw its population drop off drastically, when some buccaneers began to use it as a base, and Dutch merchants began to frequent it in search of leather, as game was abundant there. Around 1650, French , running out of room on the \u00cele de la Tortue, began to arrive on the coast, and established a colony at Trou-Borded. As the colony grew, they set up a hospital not far from the coast, on the Turgeau heights. This led to the region being known as .\nAlthough there had been no real Spanish presence in H\u00f4pital for well over 50 years, Spain retained its formal claim to the territory, and the growing presence of the French \"flibustiers\" on ostensibly Spanish lands provoked the Spanish crown to dispatch Castilian soldiers to H\u00f4pital to retake it. The mission proved to be a disaster for the Spanish, as they were outnumbered and outgunned, and in 1697, the Spanish government signed the Treaty of Ryswick, renouncing any claims to H\u00f4pital. Around this time, the French also established bases at Ester (part of Petite Rivi\u00e8re) and Gona\u00efves Haiti is bordered to the east by the Dominican Republic, which covers the rest of Hispaniola, to the south and west by the Caribbean, and to the north by the Atlantic Ocean. Cuba lies some 50 miles (80\u00a0km) west of Haiti's northern peninsula, across the Windward Passage, a strait connecting the Atlantic to the Caribbean. Jamaica is some 120 miles (190\u00a0km) west of the southern peninsula, across the Jamaica Channel, and Great Inagua Island (of The Bahamas) lies roughly 70 miles (110\u00a0km) to the north. Haiti claims sovereignty over Navassa (Navase) Island, an uninhabited U.S.-administered islet about 35 miles (55\u00a0km) to the west in the Jamaica Channel.\nEster was a rich village, inhabited by merchants, and equipped with straight streets; it was here that the governor lived. On the other hand, the surrounding region, Petite-Rivi\u00e8re, was quite poor. Following a great fire in 1711, Ester was abandoned. Yet the French presence in the region continued to grow, and soon afterward, a new city was founded to the south, L\u00e9og\u00e2ne.\nWhile the first French presence in H\u00f4pital, the region later to contain Port-au-Prince was that of the \"flibustiers\"; as the region became a real French colony, the colonial administration began to worry about the continual presence of these pirates. While useful in repelling foreign pirates, they were relatively independent, unresponsive to orders from the colonial administration, and a potential threat to it. Therefore, in the winter of 1707, Choiseul-Beaupr\u00e9, the governor of the region sought to get rid of what he saw as a threat. He insisted upon control of the hospital, but the \"flibustiers\" refused, considering that humiliating. They proceeded to close the hospital rather than cede control of it to the governor, and many of them became \"habitans\" (farmers) the first long-term European inhabitants in the region.\nAlthough the elimination of the \"flibustiers\" as a group from H\u00f4pital reinforced the authority of the colonial administration, it also made the region a more attractive target for marauding buccaneers. In order to protect the area, in 1706, a captain named de Saint-Andr\u00e9 sailed into the bay just below the hospital, in a ship named \"Le Prince\". It is said that M. de Saint-Andr\u00e9 named the area \"Port-au-Prince\" (meaning \"Port of the Prince\"), but the port and the surrounding region continued to be known as \"H\u00f4pital\" (the islets in the bay had already been known as \"les \u00eelets du Prince\" as early as 1680).\nPirates eventually refrained from troubling the area, and various nobles sought land grants from the French crown in H\u00f4pital; the first noble to control H\u00f4pital was Sieur Joseph Randot. Upon his death in 1737, Sieur Pierre Morel gained control over part of the region, with Gatien Bretton des Chapelles acquiring another portion of it.\nBy then, the colonial administration was convinced that a capital needed to be chosen, in order to better control the French portion of Hispaniola (Saint-Domingue). For a time, Petit-Go\u00e2ve and L\u00e9og\u00e2ne vied for this honor, but both were eventually ruled out for various reasons. Neither was centrally located. Petit-Go\u00e2ve's climate caused it to be too malarial, and L\u00e9ogane's topography made it difficult to defend. Thus, in 1749, a new city was built, Port-au-Prince The Place du Champ-de-Mars\u2014the site of a number of historically notable structures in the centre of the city\u2014was hit hard by the 2010 earthquake. The National Palace (rebuilt in 1918) collapsed. Other notable landmarks include the Cathedral of Notre Dame and the adjacent colonial cathedral, both of which also collapsed in the 2010 earthquake, and the National Archives, National Library, and National Museum.\nFoundation of Port-au-Prince.\nIn 1770, Port-au-Prince replaced Cap-Fran\u00e7ais (the modern Cap-Ha\u00eftien) as capital of the colony of Saint-Domingue.\nIn November 1791, it was burned in a battle between attacking black revolutionaries and defending white plantation owners.\nIt was captured by British troops on 4 June 1794, after the Battle of Port-R\u00e9publicain.\nIn 1804, it became the capital of newly independent Ha\u00efti. When Jean-Jacques Dessalines was assassinated in 1806, Port-au-Prince became the capital of the mulatto-dominated south (Cap-Ha\u00eftien was the capital of the black-dominated north). It was re-established as the capital of all of Haiti when the country was unified again in 1820 Port-au-Prince was the centre of the political and intellectual life of the country and is the seat of the State University of Haiti (established in 1920). A traditionally picturesque site has been the brash and bustling Iron Market, with its mostly female vendors. Recreation for the privileged centres around European-style social clubs, but the house of the local voodoo priest is still the heart of the urban poor community.\nMost of the Haitian elite (nearly all mulatto or nonblacks) live in the suburb of P\u00e9tionville in the 1,000\u20131,500-foot- (300\u2013450-metre-) high hills southeast of Port-au-Prince. Haiti's small but politically important Black middle class is also concentrated around Port-au-Prince. Squalor and neglect surround most of the Black urban working class even more than it does the subsistence farmer, and constant migration from the countryside continues to exacerbate their misery. Slums such as Cit\u00e9 Soleil are among the largest and most deprived in the Americas. Pop. (2009 est.) city, 875,978; metropolitan area, 2,296,386.\nAmerican occupation.\nDuring the American occupation of Haiti (1915\u20131934), Port-au-Prince, garrisoned by American Marines and Haitian gendarmes, was attacked twice by caco rebels. The first battle, which took place in 1919, was a victory of the American and Haitian government forces, as was the second attack in 1920.\n2010 earthquake.\nOn 12 January 2010, a 7.0 earthquake struck Port-au-Prince, devastating the city. Most of the central historic area of the city was destroyed, including Haiti's prized Cath\u00e9drale de Port-au-Prince, the capital building, Legislative Palace (the parliament building), Palace of Justice (Supreme Court building), several ministerial buildings, and at least one hospital. The second floor of the Presidential Palace was thrown into the first floor, and the domes skewed at a severe tilt. The seaport and airport were both damaged, limiting aid shipments. The seaport was severely damaged by the quake and was unable to accept aid shipments for the first week.\nThe airport's control tower was damaged and the US military had to set up a new control center with generators to prepare the airport for aid flights. Aid was delivered to Port-au-Prince by numerous nations and voluntary groups as part of a global relief effort. On Wednesday 20 January 2010, an aftershock rated at a magnitude of 5.9 caused additional damage. The City Hall (Mairie de Port-au-Prince) and most of the city's other government municipal buildings were destroyed in the 2010 earthquake. Ralph Youri Chevry was the mayor of the city at the time of the earthquake.\nHurricanes.\nThe worst hurricane season experienced by Haiti occurred in 2008 when four storms Fay, Gustav, Hanna, and Ike negatively impacted Haiti. Nearly 800 people were killed; 22,000 homes were destroyed; 70% of the country's crops were lost, according to reliefweb.org. Then, in 2012, Hurricane Sandy, while not making direct impact, resulted in 75 deaths, $250 million in damage and a resurgence of cholera that was estimated to have infected 5,000 people. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused catastrophic damage across Haiti, and over 500 deaths were associated with the storm in Haiti alone, along with at least $3 billion in damage. The storm also caused a massive humanitarian crisis shortly after.\nGeography.\nThe metropolitan area is subdivided into various communes (districts). There is a ring of districts that radiates out from the commune of Port-au-Prince. P\u00e9tion-Ville is an affluent suburban commune located southeast of the city. Delmas is located directly south of the airport and north of the central city, and the rather poor commune of Carrefour is located southwest of the city.\nThe commune harbors many low-income slums plagued with poverty and violence in which the most notorious, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, is situated. However, Cit\u00e9 Soleil has been recently split off from Port-au-Prince proper to form a separate commune. The Champ de Mars area has begun some modern infrastructure development as of recently. The downtown area is the site of several projected modernization efforts in the capital.\nClimate.\nPort-au-Prince has a Tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen Aw) and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Port-au-Prince's wet season runs from March through November with rainfall peaking from April to May and from August to October, with the city experiencing a relative break in rainfall during the months of June and July. The city's dry season covers the remaining three months. Port-au-Prince generally experiences warm and humid conditions during the dry season and hot and humid conditions during the wet season.\nDemographics.\nThe population of the area was 1,234,742.\nThe majority of the population is of African descent, but a prominent biracial minority controls many of the city's businesses. There are sizable numbers of Asians residents, as well as a number of Europeans (both foreign-born and native-born).\nCitizens of Arab (particularly Syrian, Lebanese, and Israeli Arab) ancestry have a large presence in the capital. Arab Haitians (a large number of whom live in Port-au-Prince) are, more often than not, concentrated in financial areas where the majority of them establish businesses. Most of the biracial residents of the city are concentrated within wealthier areas.\nEconomy.\nPort-au-Prince is one of the nation's largest centers of economy and finance. The capital exports its most widely consumed produce of coffee and sugar, and has, in the past, exported other goods, such as shoes and baseballs. Port-au-Prince has food-processing plants as well as soap, textile and cement factories. Despite political unrest, the city also relies on the tourism industry and construction companies to move its economy. Port-au-Prince was once a popular place for cruises, but has lost nearly all of its tourism, and no longer has cruise ships coming into port.\nUnemployment in Port-au-Prince is high, and compounded further by underemployment. Levels of economic activity remain prominent throughout the city, especially among people selling goods and services on the streets. Informal employment is believed to be widespread in Port-au-Prince's slums, as otherwise the population could not survive. Port-au-Prince has several upscale districts in which crime rates are significantly lower than in the city center.\nPort-au-Prince has a tourism industry. The Toussaint Louverture International Airport (referred to often as the Port-au-Prince International Airport) is the country's main international gateway for tourists. Tourists often visit the P\u00e9tion-Ville area of Port-au-Prince, with other sites of interest including gingerbread houses.\nHealth.\nThere are a number of hospitals including le Centre Hospitalier du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, H\u00f4pital de l'Universit\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat d'Ha\u00efti (l'HUEH), Centre Obstetrico Gyn\u00e9cologique Isa\u00efe Jeanty-L\u00e9on Audain, H\u00f4pital du Canap\u00e9-Vert, H\u00f4pital Fran\u00e7ais (Asile Fran\u00e7ais), H\u00f4pital Saint-Fran\u00e7ois de Sales, H\u00f4pital-Maternit\u00e9 Sapiens, H\u00f4pital OFATMA, Clinique de la Sant\u00e9, Maternit\u00e9 de Christ Roi, Centre Hospitalier Rue Berne and Maternit\u00e9 Mathieu.\nAfter the 2010 earthquake, two hospitals remained that were operational. The University of Miami in partnership with Project Medishare has created a new hospital, L'H\u00f4pital Bernard Mevs Project Medishare, to provide inpatient and outpatient care for those impacted by the January 2010 earthquake. This hospital is volunteer staffed and provides level 1 trauma care to Port-au-Prince and the surrounding regions.\nCDTI (Centre de Diagnostique et de Traitement Int\u00e9gr\u00e9) closed in April 2010 when international aid failed to materialize. It had been considered the country's premiere hospital.\nCulture.\nThe culture of the city lies primarily in the center around the National Palace as well as its surrounding areas. The National Museum is located in the grounds of the palace, established in 1938. The National Palace was one of the early structures of the city but was destroyed and then rebuilt in 1918. It was destroyed again by the earthquake on 12 January 2010 which collapsed the center's domed roof.\nAnother popular destination in the capital is the Hotel Oloffson, a 19th-century gingerbread mansion that was once the private home of two former Haitian presidents. It has become a popular hub for tourist activity in the central city. The Cath\u00e9drale de Port-au-Prince is a famed site of cultural interest and attracts foreign visitors to its Neo-Romantic architectural style.\nThe Mus\u00e9e d'Art Ha\u00eftien du Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Pierre contains work from some of the country's most talented artists, and the Mus\u00e9e National is a museum featuring historical artifacts such as King Henri Christophe's actual suicide pistol and a rusty anchor that museum operators claim was salvaged from Christopher Columbus's ship, the \"Santa Mar\u00eda\". Other notable cultural sites include the Archives Nationales, the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale (National Library) and Expressions Art Gallery. The city is the birthplace of internationally known na\u00efve artist Gesner Abelard, who was associated with the Centre d'Art. The Mus\u00e9e du Panth\u00e9on National Ha\u00eftien (MUPANAH) is a museum featuring the heroes of the independence of Haiti, the Haitian history and culture.\nOn 5 April 2015, the construction of a new LDS Temple in Port-au-Prince was announced.\nPort-au-Prince is the only city anywhere in the world to have a main avenue named for American abolitionist hero John Brown. Another is named for another abolitionist hero, Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner.\nCelebrations.\nThere is a celebration of Bawon Samdi and Gran Brigi called Fet Gede, which takes place from the Day of the Dead on 1 November through the third day of the month. This occurs in the national cemetery of Haiti. While celebrating, people wear Vodou white cotton clothing and purple headscarves. During the celebration, the cemetery becomes packed with people. Those who are celebrating make sacrifices of food for the spirits (mange lwa) and pour liquor on the gravestones among other festivities.\nGovernment.\nThe mayor of Port-au-Prince is Lucsonne Janvier, who succeeded Ralph Youri Chevry in July 2020. In 2023, Janvier's City Hall employees protested lack of salaries.\nEducation.\nPort-au-Prince various educational institutions, ranging from small vocational schools to universities. Influential international schools in Port-au-Prince include Union School, founded in 1919, and https://, founded in 1974. Both schools offer an American-style pre-college education. French-speaking students can attend the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais (Lyc\u00e9e Alexandre Dumas), located in Bourdon. Another school is An\u00eds Zun\u00faz\u00ed Bah\u00e1'\u00ed School north west of Port-au-Prince which opened its doors in 1980 which survived the 2010 Haiti earthquake and its staff were cooperating in relief efforts and sharing space and support with neighbors.\nA clinic was run at the school by a medical team from the United States and Canada. Its classes offered transition from Haitian Creole to the French language but also a secondary language in English. The [[[[[[State University of Haiti]]]]]] (\"Universit\u00e9 d'\u00c9tat d'Ha\u00efti\" in French or UEH), is located within the capital along other universities such as the Quisqueya University and the \"Universit\u00e9 des Cara\u00efbes\". There are many other institutions that observe the Haitian scholastic program. Many of them are religious academies led by foreign missionaries from France or Canada. These include Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague, \u00c9cole Sainte-Rose-de-Lima, \u00c9cole Saint-Jean-Marie Vianney, Institution du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, and Coll\u00e8ge Anne-Marie Javouhey.\nThe Ministry of Education is also located in downtown Port-au-Prince at the Palace of Ministries, adjacent to the National Palace in the Champ de Mars plaza.\nThe Haitian Group of Research and Pedagogical Activities (GHRAP) has set up several community centers for basic education. UNESCO's office at Port-au-Prince has taken a number of initiates in upgrading the educational facilities in Port-au-Prince.\nCrime.\nA 2012 independent study found that the murder rate in Port-au-Prince was 60.9 murders per 100,000 residents in February 2012. In the 22 months after the end of the President Aristide era in 2004, the murder rate for Port-au-Prince reached a high of 219 murders per 100,000 residents per year.\nHigh-crime zones in the Port-au-Prince area include Croix-des-Bouquets, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Carrefour, Bel Air, Martissant, the port road (Boulevard La Saline), urban route Nationale 1, the airport road (Boulevard Toussaint-Louverture) and its adjoining connectors to the New (\"American\") Road via Route Nationale 1. This latter area in particular has been the scene of numerous robberies, carjackings, and murders.\nIn the Bel Air neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, the murder rate reached 50 murders per 100,000 residents at the end of 2011, up from 19 murders per 100,000 residents in 2010.\nLola Castro, Regional Director of the UN World Food Programme, described Port-au-Prince as \"one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman.\"\nTransportation.\nRoads.\nAll of the major transportation systems in Haiti are located near or run through the capital. The northern highway, Route Nationale #1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince. The southern highway, Route Nationale #2, also runs through Port-au-Prince. Maintenance for these roads lapsed after the 1991 coup, prompting the World Bank to lend US$50 million designated for road repairs. The project was canceled in January 1999, however, after auditors revealed corruption. A third major highway, the Route Nationale #3, was built in successive sections up to the late 2010s, receiving support from the European Union. It connects Port-au-Prince to the central plateau and Cap-Ha\u00eftien. As of 2020, this highway was described as highly used, but also as a focal point of armed robberies.\nPublic transportation.\nThe most common form of public transportation in Haiti is the use of brightly painted pickup trucks as taxis called \"tap-taps.\"\nSeaport.\nThe seaport, Port international de Port-au-Prince, has more registered shipping than any of the over dozen ports in the country. The port's facilities include cranes, large berths, and warehouses, but these facilities are in universally poor shape. The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees compared to ports in the Dominican Republic.\nAirports.\nToussaint Louverture International Airport (Ma\u00efs G\u00e2t\u00e9), which opened in 1965 (as Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier International Airport), is north of the city. It is Haiti's major jetway, and as such, handles the vast majority of the country's international flights. Transportation to smaller cities from the major airport is done via smaller aircraft. Companies providing this service include Caribintair and Sunrise Airways.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a municipal population of 49,867 (2017), an urban population of 81,142 and a transient daily population of 250,000, it is Trinidad and Tobago's third largest municipality, after Chaguanas and San Fernando. \nPort of Spain is located on the Gulf of Paria, on the northwest coast of the island of Trinidad and is part of a larger conurbation stretching from Chaguaramas in the west to Arima in the east with an estimated population of 600,000.\nThe city serves primarily as a retail and administrative centre and it has been the capital of the island since 1757. It is also an important financial services centre for the Caribbean and is home to two of the largest banks in the region. The Piarco International Airport is the main airport on the island, connecting the capital to various major global destinations.\nPort of Spain was also the \"de facto\" capital of the short-lived West Indies Federation, which united the Caribbean.\nThe city is also home to the largest container port on the island and is one of several shipping hubs of the Caribbean, exporting both agricultural products and manufactured goods. Bauxite from Guyana is trans-shipped via facilities at Chaguaramas, about west of the city. The pre-Lenten Carnival is the city's main annual cultural festival and tourist attraction.\nToday, Port of Spain is a leading city in the Caribbean region. Trinidad and Tobago hosted the Fifth Summit of the Americas in 2009, whose guests included US president Barack Obama and US secretary of state Hillary Clinton.\nPort of Spain is also home to the biggest and most successful stock exchange in the Caribbean, the Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange (TTSE). The Nicholas Tower, as well as other skyscrapers, are well known throughout the region. These buildings dominate the city's skyline. Some of the tallest skyscrapers in the Caribbean are located in Port of Spain.\nHistory.\nPort of Spain was founded by the Spanish as . The first settlement was near the site of the Amerindian fishing village of Cumucurapo (\"place of the silk cotton trees\"), located in the area today known as Mucurapo, west of the city centre. The name Conquerabia is also recorded for an Amerindian settlement in this area; this may have been a separate village, another name for Cumucurapo, or the result of miscomprehension by early Spanish settlers, who established a port here: , later . In 1560, a Spanish garrison was posted near the foot of the Laventille Hills, which today form the city's eastern boundary.\nThe part of today's downtown Port of Spain closest to the sea was once an area of tidal mudflats covered by mangroves. The first Spanish buildings here, in the 16th and 17th centuries, were open mud-plastered ajoupas, interspersed between large silk cotton trees and other trees. The fort was a mud-walled enclosure with a shack inside, a flagpole, two or three cannon, and few Spanish soldiers. This was captured during Walter Raleigh's expedition in April 1595.\nThe Caribs were transient, travelling to the mainland (now Venezuela) and up the Orinoco River. The French naval commander visited in 1680, and reported that there was no Port of Spain. But in 1690, Spanish governor Don Sebastien de Roteta reported in writing to the King of Spain. In 1699, the of Trinidad reported to the king that the natives \"were in the habit of showering scorn and abuse upon the Holy Faith and ridiculed with jests the efforts of the Holy Fathers\".\nBy 1757, the old capital, San Jos\u00e9 de Oru\u00f1a (modern Saint Joseph), about inland, had fallen into disrepair, and Governor Don Pedro de la Moneda transferred his seat to Port of Spain, which thus became Trinidad's de facto capital. The last Spanish Governor of Trinidad, Don Jos\u00e9 Maria Chac\u00f3n, devoted much of his time to developing the new capital. He compelled the island's Cabildo (governing council) to move to Port of Spain, and he limited its powers to the municipality. The 1783 Cedula of Population, which encouraged the settlement of French Catholics in the island, led to a rapid increase in the town's population and its geographical extension westwards.\nFrom the small cluster of buildings at the foot of the Laventille Hills, eleven streets were laid out west to the area bounded by the St. Ann's River, thus establishing the grid pattern which has survived in downtown Port of Spain to the present day. Along the sea shore was the Plaza de la Marina (Marine Square), a parade ground. By 1786, the town had a population of about 3,000.\nRealising that the St. Ann's River, prone to flooding, was impeding the expansion of the town, Chac\u00f3n had its course diverted in 1787 so that it ran to the east of the city, along the foot of the Laventille Hills. Port of Spain was now able to continue spreading northwards and westwards, encroaching on the surrounding sugar-cane plantations.\nIn 1797, Trinidad was invaded by a British force under General Sir Ralph Abercromby. The British landed west of Port of Spain, at what is still called Invaders Bay, and marched towards the town. Realising his military resources were inadequate to defend the colony and wishing to avoid unnecessary destruction, Governor Chac\u00f3n capitulated and was able to negotiate generous terms with Abercromby.\nIn 1803, Port of Spain began growing southwards, with the reclamation of the foreshore mudflats, using fill from the Laventille Hills. In 1808, Port-of-Spain was destroyed by fire. At that time, it was a sprawling town of wood and shingle that had grown tremendously during the previous twenty-five years. As a result of this disaster the Government brought in legislation regarding building regulations, and the new government buildings were built of brick.\nFurther major reclamation efforts took place in the 1840s, the 1870s, and in 1906. In 1935, the Deep Water Harbour Scheme dredged the offshore area along Port of Spain's western neighbourhoods. Wrightson Road, linking downtown Port of Spain to its western suburbs, was constructed at the same time. These reclaimed lands were originally called Docksite, and were home to US forces during World War II.\nPort of Spain continued to grow in size and importance during the 19th and early 20th centuries, peaking in size in the 1960s at about 100,000 people. Since then, the population within the city limits has declined in size as the downtown area has become increasingly commercial. Today Port of Spain is the western hub of a metropolitan area stretching from Carenage to Arima along the East\u2013West Corridor.\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Port of Spain was the temporary capital of the West Indies Federation, though there were plans to build a new federal capital at Chaguaramas. Federation Park in western Port of Spain was developed to house employees of the federal government.\nIn July 1990, an extremist group held the prime minister and members of parliament hostage for 5 days while rioting and looting shook Port of Spain. The damage was a significant setback to the city's commercial district, yet businesses returned. In 2005, there was a series of bombings in Port of Spain that caused injuries to bystanders. They ceased in October 2005, but the perpetrator has not been charged.\nGeography.\nPort of Spain measures about in area and is located in the northwest section of the island of Trinidad, between the Gulf of Paria, the Northern Range and the Caroni Swamp.\nThe Northern Range is the range of tall, biodiverse hills across the northern portion of Trinidad and is considered an extension of the Andes mountains of South America, although that is geologically incorrect. Over 465 species of birds, and 100 species of mammals can be found in these mountains, making it one of the most biodiverse mountain ranges in the Caribbean. The Northern Range runs from the Chaguaramas Peninsula in the west to Toco in the east and consists mainly of steeply dipping metasedimentary rocks and lush rainforest containing a wide variety of plants and animal species. Port of Spain lies at the western end and the city climbs into the hills and valleys which are settled and largely deforested. The two tallest peaks are El Cerro del Aripo and El Tucuche which top .\nThe protected Caroni Swamp has long formed a physical barrier to the city's expansion to the south, forcing urban growth relentlessly eastward at the expense of a traffic relieving ring road. This west coast mangrove area is the island's second largest wetland after the east coast Nariva Swamp which is almost twice as large. It has well over 160 species of birds, including the national bird, the scarlet ibis. It is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions with visitor facilities and regular guided boat tours.\nSome of the city lies on land reclaimed from the Gulf of Paria, the calm sheltered bay separating Trinidad from Venezuela, while other parts climb into the hills above the city. Geographically, the Port of Port of Spain is ideal for maritime traffic, providing a natural harbour on Trinidad's north-western coasts where adverse weather conditions are extremely rare.\nUnlike Chaguanas and San Fernando, Port of Spain has a comparatively cool climate due to the surrounding Northern Range mountains. In the valleys and mountains that surround the northern outskirts of the city, temperature inversion is quite frequent.\nDistricts.\nSuburbs and surrounding towns.\nImmediately north and northwest of Port of Spain lie the suburbs of Cascade, St. Ann's and Maraval. The last one falls outside the municipal boundary, but is sometimes considered an extension of the city. St. Ann's is notable for being the location of the Prime Minister's official residence and diplomatic centre. Cascade, a mainly suburban area with treed lot type housing is located to the south-eastern area of St. Ann's. Cascade borders St. Ann's by a hill named Mount Hololo, a neighbourhood of both middle class and exclusive housing developments.\nMaraval is home to the exclusive Trinidad Country Club and right next door to the popular Long Circular Mall. Further afield, west of Diego Martin, lies the suburb of Westmoorings, which is known for its expensive Miami style highrise apartments facing the seafront. One of Trinidad's poshest shopping centres, The Falls at West-Mall, lies at the centre of these developments. As you head west beyond Carenage settlement is sparse, however the peninsula known as Chaguaramas, which was once a large US Army Base, has become a mecca for hundreds of international cruisers and a world major yacht storage and repair hub.\nTo the east along the East\u2013West Corridor, also falling outside city limits, lie the large towns of San Juan, Tunapuna and Arima. With congestion rendering downtown inaccessible during peak hours, major shopping centres like Valsayn Shopping Centre, Grand Bazaar and Trincity Mall have sprung up at highway intersections. The last two are noted for being among the largest shopping centres in the country and in the Caribbean, with of commercial space in each. Two large Universities have been established in the eastern section of the E-W corridor \u2013 the regional University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus and the multi campus local University of Trinidad and Tobago whose main campus is on the Arima outskirts.\nClimate.\nThe city has a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Am\") characterized by warm to hot temperatures year-round, with little seasonal variation due to its proximity to the equator, though nighttime temperatures dip somewhat during the winter months from January to March. Temperatures typically range from , rarely above or below . The wet season lasts from May to December, and the dry season lasts from January to April of the following year. Between December and February, it can become mild at night.\nUrban structure.\nPort of Spain's official population is relatively small, and reflects the narrow city boundaries including the central business district and a number of economically depressed and a few upscale adjoining suburbs. In addition to the official population, the adjacent East\u2013West Corridor conurbation has a population close to 600,000 people and the \"big city\" feel with its suburban car dominated commuting. The corridor is the built-up area of north Trinidad stretching from the capital, Port of Spain, east to Arima. It includes the towns of Barataria, San Juan, St. Joseph, Curepe, St. Augustine, Tunapuna, Tacarigua, Arouca, and Five Rivers, once distinct communities and now districts within a continuous urban area. For the most part it runs along the Eastern Main Road, between the Churchill\u2013Roosevelt Highway and the foothills of the Northern Range.\nParks.\nQueen's Park Savannah.\nPort of Spain's largest open space\u2014and the world's largest traffic roundabout\u2014is the Queen's Park Savannah, known colloquially simply as \"the Savannah\". It occupies about of level land, and the distance around the perimeter is about . Once sugar land, it was bought by the town council in 1817 from the Peschier family (except for a small parcel near its centre that served as the Peschier cemetery, which remains in private hands).\nAt first it was used as a vast cattle pasture in what was then the town's suburbs, but by the middle of the 19th century it had become established as a park. Until the early 1990s, horse racing was held frequently at the Savannah race track, and it also contains several cricket, football and rugby pitches. Apart from a ring of trees round its perimeter, the Savannah was never really landscaped, except for the small area in its northwest corner called the Hollows, a former reservoir now drained and planted with flowering shrubs.\nImmediately north of the Savannah\u2014also the northern limit of the city of Port of Spain\u2014are the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Emperor Valley Zoo, President's House (recently abandoned after one end fell down), the official residence of the prime minister, and Queen's Hall, the city's major performing arts venue. Lady Chancellor Road, which ascends the hills overlooking the Savannah, is one of Port of Spain's most exclusive residential areas and is the current home of former West Indies cricketer and record breaking batsman, Brian Lara.\nOn the Savannah's southern side is the Grand Stand, formerly used for viewing horse races, now used for various cultural events, most notably Carnival, when a temporary North Stand and raised stage are constructed in front of the Grand Stand, creating the \"Big Yard\", Carnival's central location since the early 20th century (previously, the main viewing area for Carnival was in downtown Port of Spain). From this location the Parade of Bands is broadcast live to the nation on Carnival Monday and Tuesday; it is also the venue for the Calypso Monarch and Carnival King and Queen Competitions and the finals of the Panorama steelpan competition. The architecturally soothing arches and curves of the Port of Spain National Academy for the Performing Arts dominate the south boundary of the Savannah between the green trimmed landmarks of Memorial Park (in remembrance of fallen soldiers during World Wars I and II) and the gingerbread styled, limestone built, colourful splendour of the Knowsley Ministry of Foreign Affairs Building.\nThe western edge of the Savannah, along Maraval Road, is the location of the Magnificent Seven, a group of late Victorian and Edwardian buildings built in an eccentric and flamboyant variety of styles. These are the recently well restored Queen's Royal College; the residences of the Anglican bishop and the Roman Catholic archbishop; Whitehall, once a private residence, then the office of the prime minister from 1963 to 2010; Mille Fleurs, once a private residence, is undergoing full restoration as a public museum and headquarters for the National Heritage Trust and was sold to the Government in 1979; Roomor, an ornate black-and-white ch\u00e2teau-like building that remains a private residence; and Stollmeyer's Castle, a turreted house supposedly modelled on Balmoral Castle. The slow pace of building restorations over the years remains a concern.\nHousing.\nHousing in Port of Spain ranges from luxurious waterfront apartments to board houses lacking indoor plumbing and motor vehicular access. Continued pressure for expansion of commercial development in Woodbrook and uptown POS (Port of Spain proper) has led to a rapid rate of decline in the city's population since 1980. The private development scheme at Damien street Woodbrook recently provided 350 luxury apartments, but those are unaffordable to most, even though they were originally intended for the general population.\nTo address the problem, East Port of Spain Development Company was formed in 2005 with a mandate to develop and redevelop a zone in east Port of Spain to improve the economic, social and physical environments of those areas. Large parts of Port of Spain's Eastern entrance have been cleared of old warehouses and substandard housing.\nThere are several new government housing projects in the city which are under construction or planned.\nGovernment.\nPort of Spain is administered by the Port of Spain City Corporation. There are 12 councillors and 4 aldermen. The mayor is elected from the membership of the council.\nThe council is presided over by the mayor, who is effectively the chief custodian of the city. It formulates policy and gives direction for the running of the city through a number of standing committees which each meet at least once per month.\nDecisions are then ratified at the statutory meeting of the council, which takes place on the last Wednesday of each month. The policies and directives of the council are executed by the administrative arm of the corporation, which is headed by the chief executive officer and has under her charge a number of senior officers and a workforce of about 3,000 daily-paid and 300 monthly-paid employees.\nThe chief executive officer and her staff are public servants functioning under the regulations of the Statutory Authorities Service Commissions Ordinance.\nMayors.\nFollowing an election in 1887, Michel Maxwell Philip became the mayor, a position that had previously been held by only whites. Bridget Brereton wrote in her 2002 book \"Race Relations in Colonial Trinidad 1870\u20131900\" that \"perhaps this marks the emergence of the coloured man as a political force in Trinidad\".\nChinua Alleyne is the current mayor of Port of Spain.\nThe electoral districts are:\nPort of Spain became a \"city\" in 1914; the ordinance was passed on 29 May and was proclaimed by the Governor on 25 June 1914. The first city councillors were elected on 2 November. Among them were oil pioneer Randolph Rust, lawyer and social activist Emmanuel Mzumbo Lazare and Dr. Enrique Prada, who was elected chairman by the council and became the first mayor of the City of Port of Spain.\nPolitics.\nFor several convocations all city MPs are from People's National Movement. For elections to the Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago, the city is covered by two constituencies: Port of Spain South and Port of Spain North/Saint Ann's West.\nEconomy.\nPort of Spain is a shopping and business centre for much of the country. Most government offices are also located in the city and many important government services can only be accessed in the Ministry offices located downtown. Within recent years, local banks headquartered here have helped it become a financial centre for the Caribbean and Central America region. Two of the largest banks in the Caribbean, Republic Bank, Trinidad and Tobago Limited and Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (RBTT, reacquired by the Royal Bank in 2008) are headquartered here or base their Caribbean operations in the city.\nTrinidad's economy is based on natural gas and oil. No heavy industrial sites are located in Port of Spain, but a major oil refinery and many petrochemical and iron and steel plants exist or are planned for sites south of it and closer to San Fernando. However, the oil and gas majors and some service companies have located their headquarters in the city to be in close proximity to government services, infrastructure and the high quality of life many citizens of Port of Spain enjoy. Some of the oil and gas company headquarters located in Port of Spain (many others are found in San Fernando &amp; Point Lisas) include BPTT, BGTT (British Gas), BHP Billiton, EOG Resources, Fluor, Repsol YPF, Atlantic LNG and Baker Hughes.\nTrinidad and Tobago is considered one of the wealthiest nations in the Caribbean and some of this wealth is on display in Port of Spain. High-income proceeds from the international sale of natural gas has aided the country in the Port of Spain International Waterfront project constructed on former Port Authority Land.\nThe Port of Port of Spain is the country's major port for containerized shipping followed by the Port of Point Lisas.\nCruise ships also dock at the port which has:\npublic international cargo-handling facilities for containerised, break-bulk, Roll-on/Roll-off and dry/liquid bulk cargo\nThe Port also operates the ferry service between Trinidad &amp; Tobago, as agents of the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.\nTourism is targeted for expansion and is a growing sector in the city's economy, but it is not as important as in other Caribbean cities. Port of Spain has a large agricultural market, known as the \"central market\" where food produced in the surrounding hinterland is traded.\nEducation.\n In 1999/2000 there were 40 Government/Assisted schools located in the Port of Spain Administrative Area. There were 17,957 students enrolled in primary schools and 15,641 enrolled in secondary school. In secondary schools, 7,567 were male and 8,074 were female.\nEducation is free and compulsory up to secondary school. Port of Spain school leavers, as citizens of Trinidad and Tobago, do not pay tuition to study at local &amp; regional public and private tertiary institutions except for graduate studies where they pay a heavily subsidised fee. There are several prominent tertiary institutions in Port of Spain and environs, in particular the St. Augustine campus of the three-campus, Caribbean-wide University of the West Indies, which had a local campus enrollment of 15,571 in academic year 2007/2008. The University of Trinidad and Tobago has several campuses and institutes in the greater Port of Spain area including the Chaguaramas Centre for Maritime Studies.\nDemographics and architecture.\nPort of Spain has a population of 18,008 males and 19,066 females, with 5,694 businesses and is home to 12,333 households with an average size of 2.9 according to the 2011 census. The city experienced an average annual growth rate of \u22122.3% between the censuses of 2000 and 2011\nPort of Spain's diverse population reflects two centuries of immigration and this shows in the architecture of its buildings. The city features French colonial 'ginger bread' style houses, buildings with New Orleans reminiscent wrought-iron railings and wooden fretwork set beside modern high-rise towers and strip malls with a mish-mash of gothic-style cathedrals, mosques and Hindu temples testifying to the diversity of cultures. It is home to African, Indian, French, English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Spanish, Portuguese, Venezuelan, Colombian, Bajan, Guyanese, Jamaican, Guadeloupean, Martinicquan, Dominican, Saint Lucian, Grenadian, Bahamian, Belizean, Surinamese, Chinese, Jewish, and Arab immigrants, most of them arriving since the Spanish Cedula of Population of 1783. Prominent Port of Spain citizens include Derek Walcott (Nobel Prize Literature 1992) and former West Indies cricketer Brian Lara.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCulture and entertainment.\nTrinidad has a rich tapestry of cultures that create occasions for celebrations beyond the expectations of many for a small Caribbean island; thus, there is much to see and do after work hours in Port of Spain, even long after the annual Carnival celebration. While the popularity of the major shopping area around Frederick Street as a nightspot centre has remained steady or declined, expansion of entertainment venues into the malls and outlying towns has occurred. St. James, \"uptown\" Port of Spain (St. Clair and Woodbrook) have seen a boom in nightclubs, sports bars and fine dining restaurants as workers from government offices and large corporations disgorge on evenings from high-rise headquarters built in newly commercialized formerly upscale neighbourhoods.\nSports.\nPort of Spain hosts major sporting venues including the Queen's Park Oval, Hasely Crawford Stadium, the Jean Pierre Complex and various sporting fields on the Queen's Park Savannah. Port of Spain was among the host cities of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The city hosted the 2009 Pan American Junior Athletics Championship and the finals of the 2001 FIFA Under-17 World Cup and 2010 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.\nGreen spaces, squares and places.\nThere are a number of well placed green spaces which have been preserved in Port of Spain. Many of them are referred to as squares or parks. Although some of the Squares have retained some of their \"original framework\" which consists of lengths of metal placed in concrete, which surround the exterior of the space, with each Square having at least four gates. These gates are positioned on the corners so as to allow the main paths of the Square to form an X. Some of the Squares have not retained nor do they give the appearance of having had the lengths of metal placed on its exterior points as lines of demarcation. By virtue of the gates to the Squares not being closed at any time and the lack of metal enclosures on others, there is the impression that these Squares and places are also open to the public at all hours. In some of the Squares, there are street lights to illuminate the interior of the square at nighttime.\nSome of the more famous squares are as follows:\nLord Harris Square which is located between Pembroke, New and Abercromby Streets. was \"established in the early 1900s, (and) is named as a tribute to Lord Harris, governor of Trinidad between 1846 and 1854\".\nWoodford Square is located between Frederick, Abercromby and Hart Streets. It is bounded by the Old National Library, The Red House and the Trinity Cathedral. Woodford Square is sometimes referred to as \"University of Woodford Square because of its occasional use by soapbox speakers and gospel preachers, this is the symbolic centre of downtown. Dr Eric Williams, Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s first prime minister, lectured to the masses here about the importance of sovereignty, which later led to the country\u2019s independence from Britain\".\n\"Woodford Square was formerly known as Brunswick Square.\" However, prior to 1808, \"Woodford Square was first known as the Place of Souls by the native Indians who fought a bloody battle on this open space. ... With the coming of the French settlers to the island, they called the Place of souls \u2013 Place Des Ames. Place Des Ames means Place of souls. Place Des Ames later became known as Brunswick Square. Brunswick Square was used as a parade ground for soldiers. Many of these soldiers were Germans. Brunswick is a German name, and so it is believed that this open space was named after the German soldiers who used it.\"\nMarine Square, while not a designated green space serves as a meeting place for many visitors coming into Port of Spain. \"Plaza De La Marina was the name given to the area extending from the Wharf in the west to the Roman Catholic Cathedral to the east.\" \"When the British came in 1797 the name was changed to Marine Square... In the 1880s a fountain was erected in the middle of the square.\" \"1962: Marine Square becomes Independence Square.\" In the 1980s \"this area was the site of the statue of Captain Arthur Andrew Cipriani (1875\u20131945), one of Trinidad and Tobago's celebrated political leaders and sportsmen...The area was then renamed the Brian Lara Promenade in honor of Trinidad and Tobago's most celebrated cricketer and record breaking batsman, Brian Charles Lara (1974\u2013). The Promenade was completed in three phases and finally opened in August 1995\".\nA little more of the history on Marine Square is revealed in the following extract \"the square was the early home of the Syrian/ Lebanese communities when they started to arrive in Trinidad during the early 20th century. They were fleeing from the harsh religious and political persecution of the Turks who had conquered their lands. The original number of these immigrants was small but it grew larger when a confrontation erupted between a Muslim religious sect and the Christian Maronites.\nAnnette Rahael, a third generation Syrian living in Trinidad explained, \"when the early settlers arrived and saw the cathedral on Marine Square they immediately claimed it as the House of God and adopted Catholicism as their religious affiliation, since there were no churches in Trinidad celebrating the liturgy of the Antiochan Orthodox religion which they had practised in their country\".\nTamarind Square \u2013 This square is located between Nelson and George Streets. It is located in close proximity to one of the local banks which was established in Trinidad and Tobago, \"Workers Bank\". This bank merged with the Trinidad Cooperative Bank and the National Commercial Bank to form First Citizens' Bank.\nVictoria Square is located on Duke Street West, Park St, and has been categorised as a Park located in Woodbrook according to WOW City. However, because of its location on Duke Street West which starts on Wrightson Road and ends on Charlotte St, it is included here.\nKew Place is one of the smallest \"squares\" in Port of Spain. \"Kew Place has a length of 0.12 kilometres\" and is large enough to hold a statue of Gandhi. It is located just opposite the main entrance to Lapeyrouse Cemetery on Philip Street and is within walking distance of Victoria Square.\nArts, entertainment, and nightlife.\nNightlife and restaurants.\nPort of Spain offers a range of nightclubs and entertainment complexes. International and regional performers such as Beyonc\u00e9, Chris Brown, Sean Paul, Rihanna, Cascada, Akon, Usher, Maroon 5, Kumar Sanu and natively born Trinidadian International Super Star Nicki Minaj to name a very few, have visited Port of Spain.\nA great variety of restaurants including Italian, Mexican, Lebanese, Thai, Venezuelan-Panyol, French, Japanese, Chinese, Creole, American and Indian can be found in Port of Spain with many concentrated on Ariapita Avenue, a popular entertainment strip, which also includes a Jazz Lounge and a Wine Tasting restaurant. MovieTowne's Fiesta Plaza, a tribute to Bourbon Street New Orleans, on the city's foreshore, features many new restaurants, open air dining and a bandstand with live entertainment. Port of Spain's restaurants provide a wide range of local and international cuisines, accompanied by the traditional fast food chains. Many of the city's restaurants can be sampled at the Taste T&amp;T Food Festival hosted at the Jean Pierre Sports Complex annually in May.\nArts.\nPort of Spain is also a cultural hub for the country. Regular dance and theatre productions occur at:\nPort of Spain is the centre of one of the largest Carnivals in the world, with tens of thousands participating in the pre-Lenten street party.\nOne of Port of Spain's most prominent artisans is Peter Minshall, who creates 'mas' or masquerade costumes for Trinidad's annual carnival. Internationally, he helped design the opening awards ceremonies for the 1987 Pan American Games, the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, the 1994 Football World Cup and the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.\nMuseums.\nThe National Museum and Art Gallery is the country's most important museum. It displays depictions of national festivals, Carnival, life during World War II and artifacts from the country's earliest settlers, the Amerindians. There are also displays by leading local and international artists, with exhibitions being mounted at various times during the year. The museum was established in 1892 and was originally called the Royal Victoria Institute, as it was built as part of the preparation for Queen Victoria's jubilee.\nThe National Museum has two smaller branch museums:\nFort San Andres which is located on South Quay, opposite City Gate. According to Geoffrey MacLean, in the Trinidad Express Newspaper in December 2014, \"the fort, which replaced a mound of mud and wood that served as the only defence of Port of Spain, was, when completed in 1787, located offshore and linked to the mainland by a wooden bridge.\"\nThe Trinidad and Tobago Police Service Museum which is located at the Old Police Headquarters on St. Vincent Street. This Museum is in close proximity to the Old Cabildo Building, called the Law Museum as of August 2012 by the Guardian TT when it was reopened, the Ministry of Legal Affairs, and the Colonial Life Insurance Co Ltd building, known as CLICO, and opposite to CLICO is the RED HOUSE.\nCrime.\nPort of Spain and its immediate environs have a higher crime rate than any other part of Trinidad. Homicides countrywide rose from fewer than 50 in the 1980s, to 97 in 1998, then to 360 in 2006 (30 murders per 100,000 persons). It rose to approximately 500 in 2008 but decreased significantly in 2010 and 2011. For the year 2012, the rate reached 354 murders per 100,000 persons, but with a state of emergency being imposed by government for approximately three months. For the year 2013 the rate reached 407. Until July of the 2014, the number reaches 207 homicides.\nMany murders are drug and gang related, especially in the depressed communities of East Port of Spain. The police administration has responded by improving the working conditions of officers, increasing the use of forensic evidence and surveillance technology (CCTV cameras) as well as hiring overseas experts.\nReports of kidnappings for ransom which were on the rise a few years ago have declined dramatically since 2006. However, theft and violent crimes remain prevalent to this date, while crime and the perception of crime continues to hamper the economic prospects of the city.\nIn 2022, the U.S. Department of State updated the Trinidad and Tobago travel advisory first to Level 2: Exercise increased precautions and then to Level 3: Reconsider travel in November 2022. Violent crime was cited as the reason for this advisory, specifically kidnapping and terrorism as well as shootings in Port of Spain specifically. The advisory specifies that U.S. government personnel are prohibited from travelling to Laventille, Beetham, Sea Lots, Cocorite, and the interior of Queens\u2019 Park Savannah; after dark, they are prohibited from travelling to Downtown Port of Spain, Fort George Overlook and all beaches.\nInfrastructure.\nHealth.\nFive Regional Health Authorities (RHAs) deliver public health care services to the people of Trinidad and Tobago. RHAs are autonomous bodies that own and operate health facilities in their respective regions. The Port of Spain municipality is served by the North West Regional Health Authority (NWRHA).\nThe NWRHA administers and manages the Port of Spain General Hospital, St. Ann's Psychiatric Hospital, St. James Medical Complex and 16 health centres that serve a catchment area of 500,000 people. The Port of Spain General Hospital is one of the major trauma centres in the nation and in the Southern Caribbean.\nThe demand for speedy quality health service has led to the establishment of private hospitals. The major ones are:\nIn the greater Port of Spain area, the public and fully state-funded Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex, run by the North Central RHA, is also a major provider of medical services. It includes the Wendy Fitzwilliam Children's Ward and the Mt. Hope Women's Hospital.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nPort of Spain has one of the most dense and complex systems of roadways in Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean. \nTransportation in and out of Port of Spain is plagued by heavy traffic delays at morning and evening rush hour. Port of Spain's major roadways are equipped with CCTV cameras, road signage, lane markings, cat eyes, and other safety features.\nThere are also a few major inner-city roadways. Ariapita Avenue is one of them, being the center of the city's nightlife and at the center of a revitalization project. The Queen's Park Savannah is said to be the world's largest roundabout and has a perimeter roadway that is technically a collection of roadways all providing access to the Savannah's environs. Tragarete Road is another inner-city roadway that runs into St. James, also providing access to the Queen's Park Oval and One Woodbrook Place. \nPublic transport.\nCity Gate serves as a transportation hub for public buses and private mini-buses (locally known as maxi-taxis). City Gate is located on South Quay just south of Independence Square. The PTSC facilities and service have been plagued with issues for a period of time, but recently there have been upgrades to the service and facilities including free WiFi on coach buses, a new coach waiting area at City Gate and addition of new buses to the fleet.\nA ferry service links Port of Spain with Scarborough, Tobago and a water taxi service, restarted in December 2008 (Trinidad's west coast towns were once served by steamship), links it with San Fernando. The ferry terminal is located at South Quay while the water taxi terminal is part of the Port of Spain International Waterfront Centre.\nIn the past, a five-route trolleybus system served Port of Spain from 1941 to 1956. Trams served the city from 1883 (initially horse-drawn; electric from 1895) until the 1950s.\nAirport.\nLike the rest of the island of Trinidad, Port of Spain is served by the Piarco International Airport located in Piarco, approximately east of Port of Spain via the Churchill Roosevelt Highway. \nUpgrade plans.\nTo ease the current traffic woes that result in two- to three-hour commutes during rush hours, a number of projects are in various stages of implementation. The upgrading of the Churchill\u2013Roosevelt highway to a grade separated expressway and the extension of water ferry services from Port of Spain to the major urban hubs along the west coast are particularly notable.\nUtilities.\nElectricity generation is handled by Powergen, a privately owned electricity producer, while electrical distribution is handled by the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission (T&amp;TEC) a state owned enterprise. Powergen had one natural gas-fired generation plant located on Wrightson Road in Port of Spain however this plant was closed on 14 January 2016 ending 121 years of power generation in Port of Spain. Port of Spain is supplied by power from power generation facilities located in Point Lisas, Penal and La Brea.\nTelecommunications are regulated by the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT). It has successfully de-monopolised the industry, granting several new mobile licenses in 2005 for two private companies, Digicel and Laqtel to offer wireless service in competition with TSTT. Laqtel which would have offered Trinidad and Tobago's first CDMA (3G) network had its license revoked by the TATT in 2008. Fixed-line telephone service and broadband was also once a monopoly controlled by Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago (TSTT). Flow alongside Digicel also now offers these services to its wide customer base. LTE-A, cable and fiber broadband services in excess of 100\u00a0Mbit/s are available throughout the city. There are Wi-Fi hotspots at all major hotels and for free in coffee shops, malls and at the airport. Broadband and mobile competition has resulted in lower rates and wider availability of services for consumers.\nWater and sewerage are under the purview of the Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (WaSA). Much of the city's water supply comes from the Caroni Arena Dam located in the Arena Forest Reserve near Brazil Village. The Caroni Arena Dam supplies the Caroni Water Treatment Plant located opposite the Piarco International Airport Southern Terminal. This Caroni Water Treatment Plant was upgraded in 2000 to a total daily production of 75 m.g.d.\nAnother important facility, the new Beetham Waste Water Treatment Plant, began to treat domestic waste to international standards in 2004. The plant serves customers within Greater Port-of Spain and environs from Pt. Cumana in the west to Mt. Hope in the east including Diego Martin and Maraval.\nMost solid waste is disposed of in the Beetham Landfill, commonly known as \"La Basse\".\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nPort of Spain's sister cities are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The commune covers an area of and as of 2002 had a population of 223,552 people.\nIn 1863, following British bombardment, Porto-Novo accepted French protection, and by 1900, it became the capital of French Dahomey. After Benin's independence in 1960, Porto-Novo retained its status as the official capital, while Cotonou emerged as the economic and administrative hub.\nSituated on an inlet of the Gulf of Guinea, in the southeastern portion of the country, the city was originally developed as a port for the transatlantic slave trade led by the Portuguese Empire. It is Benin's second-largest city, and although it is the official capital, where the national legislature sits, the larger city of Cotonou is the seat of government, where most of the government buildings are situated and government departments operate.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Porto-Novo\" is of Portuguese origin, literally meaning \"New Port\". It remains untranslated in French, the national language of Benin.\nHistory.\nPorto-Novo was once a tributary of the Yoruba Oyo Empire, which had offered it protection from the neighbouring Fon, who were expanding their influence and power in the region. Today, the Yoruba community in Porto-Novo remains one of the two original ethnic groups in the city. The city was originally called \"Ajashe\" (\u00c0j\u00e0\u1e63\u1eb9\u0301 in Yoruba orthography) by the Yorubas, and \"Hogbonu\" by the Gun.\nAlthough historically the original inhabitants of the area were Yoruba speaking, there seems to have been a wave of migration from the region of Allada further west in the 1600s, which brought Te-Agbalin (or T\u00ea-Agbanlin) and his group to the region of Ajashe in the late 16th century. \nIn 1730, the Portuguese Eucaristo de Campos named the city \"Porto-Novo.\" Although colonizers claim the name was due to its resemblance to the city of Porto, the real reason was to signal the development of a new port for the slave trade.\nIn 1861, the British, who were active in nearby Nigeria, bombarded the city, which caused the Kingdom of Porto-Novo to accept the French offer of protection in 1863. The neighbouring Kingdom of Dahomey objected to French involvement in the region and war broke out between the two states. In 1883, Porto-Novo was incorporated into the French \"colony of Dahomey and its dependencies\" and in 1900, it became Dahomey's capital city. As a consequence, the city\u2019s inhabitants, who previously spoke local languages, began to adopt French alongside them, with the addition of French to the language repertoire of the city's inhabitants. Unlike the city's earlier Gun migrants, however, the French sought to impose their language in all spheres of life and completely stamp out the use and proliferation of indigenous languages.\nThe kings of Porto-Novo continued to rule in the city, both officially and unofficially, until the death of the last king, Alohinto Gbeffa, in 1976. From 1908, the king held the title of \"Chef sup\u00e9rieur\".\nMany Afro-Brazilians settled in Porto-Novo following their return to Africa after emancipation in Brazil. Brazilian architecture and foods are important to the city's cultural life.\nUnder French colonial rule, flight across the new border to British-ruled Nigeria in order to avoid harsh taxation, military service and forced labour was common. Of note is the fact that the Nigeria-Benin southern border area arbitrarily cuts through contiguous areas of Yoruba and Egun-speaking people. A combination of the aforementioned facts, coupled with the fact that the city itself lies within the sphere of Nigerian socioeconomic influence, have given Porto-Novians a preference for some measure of bi-nationality or dual citizenship, with the necessary linguistic consequences; for example, Nigerian home video films in Yoruba with English subtitles have become popular in Porto-Novo and its suburbs.\nSeat of government.\nBenin's parliament (\"Assembl\u00e9e nationale\") is in Porto-Novo, the official capital, but most other government institutions, including the presidency, are located in Cotonou. \nEconomy.\nThe region around Porto-Novo produces palm oil, cotton and kapok. Petroleum was discovered off the coast of the city in 1968 and has become an important export since the 1990s. Porto-Novo has a cement factory. The city is home to a branch of the Banque Internationale du B\u00e9nin, a major bank in Benin, and the Ouando Market.\nTransport.\nPorto-Novo is served by an extension of the B\u00e9nirail train system. Privately owned motorcycle taxis known as \"zemijan\" are used throughout the city. The city is located about away from Cotonou Airport, which has flights to major cities in West Africa and Europe.\nDemographics.\nPorto-Novo had an enumerated population of 264,320 in 2013. As of 2023, estimates suggest a population of around 300,000. The residents are mostly Yoruba and Gun people as well as people from other parts of the country, and from neighbouring Nigeria.\nPopulation trend:\nGeography.\nPorto-Novo is located in the south of Benin, 13 kilometers from the Atlantic Ocean, separated by a lagoon. Its altitude is approximately 38 meters and it covers an area of 52 km\u00b2.\nIt is located 30 kilometers east of Cotonou, the economic capital, and 12 kilometers from the Nigerian border to the east. Neighboring municipalities include Akpro-Miss\u00e9r\u00e9t\u00e9, Avrankou, and Adjarra to the north, S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji to the south, Adjarra to the east, and Agu\u00e9gu\u00e9s to the west.\nClimate.\nPorto-Novo has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Aw\") with consistently hot and humid conditions and two wet seasons: a long wet season from March to July and a shorter rain season in September and October. The city\u2019s location on the edge of the Dahomey Gap makes it much drier than would be expected so close to the equator, although it is less dry than Accra or Lom\u00e9.\nMusic.\nAdjogan music is endemic to Porto-Novo. The style of music is played on an alounloun, a stick with metallic rings attached which jingle in time with the beating of the stick. The alounloun is said to descend from the staff of office of King Te-Agdanlin and was traditionally played to honour the King and his ministers. The music is also played in the city's Roman Catholic churches, but the royal bird crest symbol has been replaced with a cross.\nSports.\nThe \"Stade Municipal\" and the \"Stade Charles de Gaulle\" are the largest football stadiums in the city.\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the places of worship, Christian churches are predominant: Roman Catholic Diocese of Porto Novo (Catholic Church), Protestant Methodist Church in Benin (World Methodist Council), Celestial Church of Christ, Union of Baptist Churches of Benin (Baptist World Alliance), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques, most notably the Grand Mosque. There are also several Voodoo temples in the city.\nTemple of Abessan and Zangbeto Shrine.\nIn 2007, as part of the development of tourist attractions in the city, two new monumental buildings related to Voodoo were constructed, financed by the Benin Chamber of Commerce (CCB) and designed by an architectural firm. The first of these was a new temple building dedicated to the god Abessan (or Avessan) consisting of a 10-metre-tall tower designed to resemble a termite mound. This design was inspired by the mythical emergence of Abessan from a termite mound. This modern building is not a reconstruction of an earlier temple but rather a new construction and design inspired by the mythical origin of Abessan. The current structure replaced an earlier temple building which was a small circular hut. The second was a new building for the national headquarters of the Zangbeto, which is designed to resemble a large cone made of raffia and represents the figure of Kpakliyaho (the ancestor of the Zangbeto). The construction of these new monuments was part of the CCB\u2019s plan to make Porto-Novo the \"hub of world tourism for the worship of the Vodun religion\". These new buildings with their original designs have been strongly criticized by some heritage conservationists.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located on the southern coast of Santiago island within the Sotavento Islands group, the city is the seat of the Praia Municipality. Praia is the political, economic and cultural center of Cape Verde.\nHistory.\n \nThe island of Santiago was discovered by Ant\u00f3nio da Noli in 1460. The first settlement on the island was Ribeira Grande (Cidade Velha). The village \"Praia de Santa Maria\" was first mentioned around 1615 and grew near the natural harbour. The ports of Santiago were important ports of call for ships sailing between Portugal and the Portuguese colonies in Africa and South America. Between the end of the 16th century and the end of the 18th century, both Ribeira Grande and Praia suffered many pirate attacks, including those by Francis Drake (1585) and Jacques Cassard (1712).\nDue to its strategic position on a plateau it had better protection against pirate attacks, which gave it a large advantage over the older city of Ribeira Grande (Cidade Velha). It gradually superseded Cidade Velha to become the most important settlement of Cape Verde, and became the capital of Cape Verde in 1770. The naval battle of Porto Praya took place at Praia Harbour on 16 April 1781, as Portugal was neutral, it involved Great Britain and France and ended in a tactical draw and French strategic victory. Praia was the first stop of Charles Darwin's voyage with in 1832.\nIn the course of the 19th century, the \"Plateau\" was completely redeveloped with streets according to a grid plan, lined with grand colonial buildings and mansions. Praia officially became a city (\"cidade\") in 1858, which secured its status as the capital of Cape Verde, concentrating political, religious and economic roles. In the early 1920s, the population was around 21,000.\nAs in other parts of the archipelago, resistance against Portuguese rule rose in the 1950s. There was no open independence war like in Guinea-Bissau; after the 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal and the resulting end of the Portuguese Colonial War, Cape Verde declared independence in July 1975. After independence, Praia underwent a demographic boom, receiving migrating movements from all the islands. As a result, 56% of the entire population of Cape Verde resides in Santiago; and 29% in the Municipality of Praia alone. Its estimated population has reached 151,436 (2015). On 28 June 1985, Praia became member of UCCLA, the Union of Luso \u2013 Afro-Americo-Asiatic Capital Cities, an international organization.\nGeography.\nGeographically, Praia may be described as a set of plateaus and their surrounding valleys. These plateaus generally have the name \"achada\" (Achada de Santo Ant\u00f3nio, Achada de S\u00e3o Filipe, Achada Eug\u00e9nio Lima, Achada Grande, Achadinha, etc. \u2014 \"achada\" being a Portuguese word to designate a volcanic plateau), but the central one is called Plateau. The urban settlement is made mostly on top of these plateaus and along the valleys. The islet of Santa Maria is in front of the beach bearing the same name.\nFor a long time, only the \"Plateau\" was considered to be the city, the other neighbourhoods being relegated to the condition of peripheral suburbs, in spite of always having a close relationship with the \"Plateau\" (people movements, goods and services exchanges, etc.). This is why only the \"Plateau\" previously had relatively well-developed urbanization with its own infra-structures. The remaining neighbourhoods developed in a more organic, chaotic way.\nOnly after independence did the \"Plateau\" merge with the other neighbourhoods to constitute what is now considered the City of Praia. The whole city was, at the time, equipped with adequate infrastructure. Urbanization begun immediately after independence and sought to expand north.\nClimate.\nPraia has a desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: BWh) with a short wet season and a lengthy, very pronounced dry season. In fact, outside of the months of August, September and October, little precipitation falls on Praia. The city on average sees about of rain per year. Since the coldest month is far above its temperature patterns resembles a tropical climate, but lacks enough precipitation to be classified as such. Despite the fact that it has an arid climate, Praia seldom gets very hot or very cold, due to its oceanside location on Santiago Island. Temperatures are warm and constant with an average high temperature of and an average low temperature of .\nDemographics.\nAccording to the national statistics office, the city's population was estimated 159,050 as of July 2017. As of the mid-19th century, the population was estimated at 1,500 to 2,000.\nWhen Edmund Roberts visited in 1832, he noted a population of black people in Praia totaling about \"nineteen twentieths\" of the population. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEducation.\nThe city of Praia is home to the first primary school in the archipelago, originally known as the \"Escola Central\" (today known as the \"Escola Grande\"). For much time it was the only primary school in Praia. At the beginning of the 1960s, other primary schools began to be built in neighbourhoods around the Plateau and in other localities on the island.\nPraia was also the first site in Cape Verde with a secondary education institution with the creation of the \"Liceu Nacional\" in 1861. However, the Portuguese authorities were not interested in implementing secondary education in Cape Verde and the school failed as a result; secondary education became, afterwards, the role of the \"Semin\u00e1rio de Ribeira Brava\" on the island of S\u00e3o Nicolau, and later of the lyceum in Mindelo.\nIn 1960, Praia again had secondary education, first with a facility on 12 September Plaza and later in its own building. With the expansion of education in Cape Verde in the 1990s, buildings dedicated to education were constructed in Cape Verde, and Praia in 2016 had 12 secondary education schools.\nInternational schools:\nFor higher education, there are the Universidade de Santiago, \"Instituto Superior de Ciencias Jurid\u00edcas e Sociais\", \"Instituto Superior de Ciencias Econ\u00f3micas e Empresariais\", Jean Piaget University of Cape Verde, and University of Cape Verde.\nPraia is also home to the National Library and the National Archives Building or the ANCV.\nEconomy.\nThe principal economic activities of Praia belong to the tertiary sector. Beyond activities related to administration and governance (local and national), there are extensive commerce, services (health care, education, tourism, restaurants and hotels, public functions, etc.), and other activities of a liberal character.\nBeing the nation's capital as well as the economic hub, Praia is one of the most economically viable cities in the Cape Verde archipelago. About one third (1/3) of the city's population lives below the poverty line today (2014). The gross metropolitan product for the city is about 39% of the country's GDP, translating into US$4764 income per capita.\nTransport.\nThe city is served by Nelson Mandela International Airport and Cabo Verde Airlines, both having headquarters in Praia. It has the nation's second most used port, Praia Harbor, with a ferry terminal linking to other islands, direct ferry routes are Maio, Fogo and S\u00e3o Vicente. The port is managed by the national port authority ENAPOR. The port was reconstructed and expanded in 2014.\nPraia has a dual carriageway ring road, the \"Circular da Praia\" (EN1-ST06), which is connected with the main national roads to the north (EN1-ST01) and the west (EN1-ST05) of the island. The main roads inside the city are \"Avenida Gr\u00e3o Ducado de Luxemburgo\" (from the centre to the west), Avenida Am\u00edlcar Cabral (in \"Plateau\") and Avenida Cidade de Lisboa.\nPublic transport.\nPublic transport within the city of Praia is provided by the company SolAtl\u00e2ntico. There are 12 city bus lines. Intercity share taxis for other cities on the island of Santiago depart from the Sucupira terminal in the city centre, which was opened in May 2018. In 2015 a project called EcobusCV started running a fleet of dual fuel waste vegetable oil / diesel minibuses between Praia and Assomada. However, services were suspended in November 2016.\nCulture.\nThere is the \"Museu Etnogr\u00e1fico\" (Ethnographic Museum), which was founded in 1997. Some of the oldest buildings in Praia are Jaime Mota Barracks (Quartel Jaime Mota) dating from 1826. Since 2016, the historic centre of Praia is on the tentative list of World Heritage Sites.\nLandmarks in the colonial city center include Albuquerque Square (named after the colonial governor of the mid 19th century, Caetano Alexandre de Almeida e Albuquerque), the old city hall built in the 1920s, the Presidential Palace, which was constructed in the end of the 19th century to house the Portuguese governor and the \"Monumento de Diogo Gomes\", named after the Portuguese navigator who discovered the island of Santiago in 1460.\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Diocese of Santiago de Cabo Verde (Catholic Church), Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Church of the Nazarene, Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Assemblies of God.\nSports.\nPraia is home to several sports teams with the most popular football (soccer) clubs include Sporting, Boavista, Travadores, Acad\u00e9mica, Vit\u00f3ria and Desportivo; others include ADESBA, based in Craveiro Lopes; Celtic, based in Achadinha de Baixo; Tchadense, based out of Achada Santo Ant\u00f4nio; Delta, and Eug\u00eanio Lima, based in that neighbourhood. Basketball clubs include ABC Praia, Bairro and Travadores. Volleyball clubs include Desportivo da Praia. All are part of the Santiago League South Zone. Many clubs play at Est\u00e1dio da V\u00e1rzea.\nInternational relations.\nPraia is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Like its sibling LOGO, it was developed as an early foray into the technology of computer-assisted instruction.\nPILOT is an imperative language similar in structure to BASIC and FORTRAN in its basic layout and structure. Its keywords are single characters, codice_1 for \"type\" to print text, or codice_2 for \"accept\", to input values from the user.\nHistory.\nStarting in 1960, John Amsden Starkweather a psychology professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) medical center, developed a simple system for automating the construction of computer question-and-answer tests. Working with the Dixie Elementary School District in Marin County, by 1962 the system was functional on a IBM 1620 and given the name COMPUTEST.\nUCSF installed a IBM System/360 Model 50, and Starkweather applied for a grant for further development by the U.S. Office of Education in 1965. Using this funding, Starkweather began development of an expanded version of the system with more functionality. He gave this version the new name PILOT. Early versions were shown in 1966, and the almost-complete version was released in 1968. The next year it was released into the public domain.\nPILOT was later adopted by H. Dean Brown at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) Education Laboratory. Brown popularized PILOT as a language for use directly by children. Brown's efforts changed the language from one intended for use by teachers to write tests and instructional materials to one intended to be used to teach programming.\nPILOT was ported to a number of other systems, and various extensions and changes added at these sites. This led to a number of incompatible implementations with names like PYLON and NYLON. In 1973, Starkweather brought together a number of people interested in computer aided teaching to develop a machine-independent specification for the language, PILOT-73. A portable subset was also defined as Core PILOT. Core was then ported to the Datapoint 2200, an Intel 8008 powered terminal that would later be known as a personal computer. At $13,000, this was more expensive than many contemporary minicomputers and did not see much use. However, this port proved very useful after the Intel 8080 came to market and spawned many inexpensive microcomputers.\nStarting in the late 1970s, Western Washington University began expanding the language into Common PILOT. This formed the basis for a number of later microcomputer variants. Processor Technology developed a version for their Sol-20, but the company went out of business before it was published. This nevertheless inspired several other versions during this era. Among these was Nevada PILOT for CP/M systems, based on Common, which in turn was the basis for Atari PILOT, which added a graphics system using turtle graphics and basic sound support. PILOT on the Apple II was written in UCSD Pascal. These versions led to a revival of the PILOT language for teaching, and led to an expanded version known as Super PILOT which added device control so programs could play videodisks and similar tasks.\nFor a time there was an effort to make a single standard for the language as IEEE Standard 1154-1991, but this was abandoned in 2000.\nLanguage syntax.\nA line of PILOT code contains (from left to right) the following syntax elements:\nA label can also be alone in a line, not followed by other code. The syntax for a label is an asterisk followed by an identifier (alphanumeric string with alphabetic initial character).\nCommand letters.\nThe following commands are used in \"core PILOT\". Lines beginning with \"R:\" indicate a remark (or a comment) explaining the code that follows.\n R:Next line of input replaces current contents of accept buffer\n A:\n R:Next line of input replaces accept buffer, and string variable 'FREE'\n A:$FREE\n R:Next 3 lines of input assigned to string variables 'X', 'Y' and 'Z'\n A:$X,$Y,$Z\n R:Numeric input assigned to numeric variable \"Q\"\n A:#Q\n R:Assign arithmetic mean of #X and #Y to #AM\n C:#AM=(#X+#Y)/2\nThe first match string (if any) that is a substring of the accept buffer is assigned to the special variable $MATCH. The buffer characters left of the first match are assigned to $LEFT, and the characters on the right are assigned to $RIGHT.\nThe match flag is set to 'yes' or 'no', depending on whether a match is made. Any statement that has a Y following the command letter is processed only if the match flag is set. Statements with N are processed only if the flag is not set.\nDerivatives.\nExtensions to core PILOT include arrays and floating point numbers in Apple PILOT for the Apple II, and LOGO-inspired turtle graphics in Atari PILOT for Atari 8-bit computers.\nBetween 1979 and 1983 the UK PILOT User Group was run by Alec Wood a teacher at Wirral Grammar School for Boys, Merseyside UK. Several machine code versions of a mini PILOT were produced for the microcomputers of the time and a school in Scotland developed an interactive foreign language tutorial where pupils guided footprints around a town asking and answering questions in German, French, etc. An article in the December 1979 of \"Computer Age\" covered an early implementation called Tiny Pilot and gave a complete machine code listing.\nVersions of PILOT written using BASIC interpreters were released in the 1970s and early 1980s. The April 1973 edition of People's Computer Company's newsletter included such a system written in HP Time-Shared BASIC for the HP 2100 system. PETPILOT (PILOT for the Commodore PET) was the first non-Commodore language for the PET and was written in Microsoft BASIC which shipped with the PET, with a little assistance from Bill Gates. It was created in 1979 by Dave Gomberg and could run on a 4K PET (which was never shipped) and ran well on the 8K PETs that Commodore shipped. It was written in Larry Tessler's living room on PET serial number 2. In 1978, Byte Magazine published a non-Turing complete derivative of PILOT known as Waduzitdo by Larry Kheriarty.\nAtari PILOT, released in ROM cartridge form in 1981 for the Atari 8-bit computers, added turtle graphics and sound support. These instructions used two-letter commands. Atari used PILOT as one of their primary languages at the computer camps they ran in the early 1980s.\n1983's Vanilla PILOT for the Commodore 64 also added turtle graphics, as did \"Super Turtle PILOT\" which was published as a type-in listing in the October 1987 issue of COMPUTE! magazine.\nIn 1991 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) published a standard for Pilot as IEEE Std 1154-1991. It has since been withdrawn. A reference implementation based on this was implemented by Eric Raymond, and maintained\u2014-reluctantly\u2014-for the next 15 years.\nIn 1990 eSTeem PILOT for Atari ST computers was developed and programmed by Tom Nielsen, EdD. Based on the IEEE Standards for PILOT, it includes Atari-specific features such as control of Laserdisc and CDROM devices.\nA 2018 hobbyist implementation, psPILOT, based in part on the IEEE standard, was implemented using Microsoft's PowerShell scripting language.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also the capital city of the Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra administrative region. Rabat is located on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg, opposite Sal\u00e9, the city's main commuter town.\nRabat was founded in the 12th century by the Almohads. After a period of growth, the city fell into a long period of decline. In the 17th century, Rabat became a haven for Barbary pirates. When the French established a protectorate over Morocco in 1912, Rabat became its administrative center. When Morocco achieved independence in 1955, Rabat became its capital.\nRabat, Temara, and Sal\u00e9 form a conurbation of over 1.8 million people. Rabat is one of four Imperial cities of Morocco, and its medina is listed as a World Heritage Site. It is accessible by train through the ONCF system and by plane through the nearby Rabat\u2013Sal\u00e9 Airport.\nEtymology.\nThe name Rabat comes from the Arabic word (\"a-Rib\u0101\u1e6d\") meaning \"the ribat\", an Islamic base or fortification. This name is short for (\"Rib\u0101\u1e6du al-Fat\u1e25\") meaning \"the ribat of conquest\" or \"stronghold of victory\"\u2014a title given by the Almohads when they established the city as a naval base in 1170.\nHistory.\nAncient \"Sala\".\nIn the first millennium BC the Phoenicians founded several trading colonies along the Atlantic coast of what is now Morocco, but the existence of a Phoenician settlement in the area, called \"Sala\" or \"Shallat\", has been debated by archeologists. By the first century BC the local inhabitants were still writing in the neo-Punic language, but the region came under the influence of Rome. It was controlled by the ancient Berber Mauretanian Kingdom until it was formally annexed by Rome in the first century BC. On the site now known as Chellah, just south of the walled city today, the Romans built a city named \"Sala Colonia\". Excavations have revealed that older Mauretanian structures existed on the site before Roman structures were built over them. Along with Lixus, Sala Colonia was one of the two main naval outposts held by the Romans on the Atlantic coast of the \"Mauretania Tingitana\" province. The port of Sala (now disappeared) was used by commercial Roman ships as a way station on their southwestward passages to Anfa and the \"Insula Purpuraria\" (Mogador island).\nArchaeological objects of Visigothic and Byzantine origin found in the area attest to the persistence of commercial or political contacts between Sala and Roman Europe, up to the establishment of a Byzantine presence in North Africa during the 7th century. However, Sala began to be abandoned in the 5th century and was mostly in ruins when the Muslim Arabs arrived in the 7th century and established Islamic influence in the region.\nMedieval Islamic period.\nIn the 10th century the Umayyads of Cordoba, or their Zenata Berber allies in the region, founded a ribat or fortified monastery/outpost in this area, to defend against the Barghawata Berbers who had established a Kharijite state to the south. This ribat was most likely on the same site as the current Kasbah of the Udayas, but its location has not been confirmed by historians. Around 1030, a new town called Sal\u0101 (the present Sal\u00e9) was founded on the opposite side of the river (the north side) by the Banu 'Ashara family.\nOne of the last Almoravid emirs, Tashfin ibn Ali (r. 1143\u20131145) built a new \"ribat\" on the site of the current kasbah as part of his efforts to hold back the Almohads. Almohads nonetheless defeated the Almoravids and destroyed the ribat shortly after. In 1150 or 1151 the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min built a new kasbah (citadel) to replace the former \"ribat\", within which he included a palace and a mosque. This Almohad kasbah corresponds to the current Kasbah of the Udayas (which was expanded in later periods). Abd al-Mu'min also had an underground canal dug to divert a water source to this location, allowing for future settlement and urbanization in the area. The site became a military staging ground for Almohad armies setting out on campaigns to Al-Andalus.\nThe Almohad caliph Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur (r. 1184\u20131199) embarked on an ambitious project to construct a new fortified imperial capital, called \"al-Mahdiyya\" or \"Ribat al-Fath\", on the site of what is now the medina (old city) of Rabat, with new walls extending over a vast area beyond the kasbah. This project also included the construction of an enormous mosque (the remains of which include the Hassan Tower) and of new grand gateways such as \"Bab er-Rouah\" and the main gate of the kasbah, now known as \"Bab Udaya\" or \"Bab al-Kbir\". After al-Mansur's death in 1199 the mosque and the capital remained unfinished and his successors lacked the resources or the will to finish it. The new city was never fully inhabited and the site was practically abandoned.\nDuring the Marinid dynasty period (13th to 15th centuries), the town of Sal\u00e9 across the river grew more important than the settlements of the south bank. In 1515 Leo Africanus reported that Rabat had declined so much that only 100 inhabited houses remained. The Marinids did build a Great Mosque in what is now the medina of Rabat and on the nearby site of Chellah (ancient Sala) they built a royal necropolis for their dynasty.\nCorsair republic.\nIn 1609, Philip III decreed the expulsion of all Moriscos (people of Muslim or Moorish descent) from Spain. About 2000 of these refugees, originally from the town of Hornachos near Badajoz, Spain, settled around Sal\u00e9 and occupied the kasbah, attracting between 5000 and 14,000 other Moriscos to join them. Rabat and neighboring Sal\u00e9 united to form the Republic of Bou Regreg in 1627. This autonomous republic became a base for corsairs: pirates, also known as the \"Sal\u00e9 Rovers\", who preyed on merchant ships around the shores of Western Europe. \nDuring this time, the area below the kasbah on the south bank became more heavily populated due to the Morisco and Andalusi refugees. A new \"Andalusian Wall\" was built to delimit this area in the northern part of the former Almohad walled city. What is now known as the Street of the Consuls became an important road artery even at this time. The name \"Rabat\" was not yet in use; the city of the south bank was known as \"New Sal\u00e9\" while the city of the north bank was known as \"Old Sal\u00e9\". Corsair activities were based in New Sal\u00e9, whereas the inhabitants of Old Sal\u00e9 generally did not participate in piracy.\n'Alawi rule.\nThe pirates did not have to contend with any central authority until al-Rashid, the founder of the 'Alawi dynasty, conquered the area in 1666 and united most of Morocco under his rule. Nonetheless, the 'Alawi sultans allowed the piracy to continue up until the reign of Moulay Slimane in the early 19th century. This led to the shelling of the city by Austria in 1829 after an Austrian ship had been lost to a pirate attack.\nDuring the early part of the 'Alawi period (17th\u201318th centuries), the sultans took some interest in the city of the south bank and carried out constructions and repairs to the kasbah. Moulay Isma'il (r. 1672\u20131727) expanded the kasbah southward and built a royal residence within it towards the end of the 17th century (it serves as a museum today). Moulay Isma'il was also responsible for settling a part of the Udayas (or Oudayas), a \"guich\" tribe (military tribe serving the sultan's army), in the kasbah to serve as a counterbalancing force against other unruly tribes in the region. Under Sidi Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah (r. 1757\u20131790), a new royal palace, the Dar al-Makhzen, was established in the southwest part of the Almohad walled area towards the end of the 18th century. These additions began to give the city the character and function of a royal residence used by the ruling dynasty outside their main capitals.\nMoulay Slimane (r. 1792\u20131822) built another palace along the seaside called \"Dar al-Bahr\" and built new mosques such as the Moulay Slimane Mosque. He also ordered the creation of a Jewish quarter, the \"Mellah\", in the eastern part of the Andalusian medina, in a formerly occupied by orchards. It was also towards the beginning of the 19th century that the city walls, formerly limited to the Almohad-era perimeter, were extended significantly to the southwest, thus expanding the city to cover around 840 hectares. The old Almohad walls and gates were still retained and the Almohad-era enclosure remained a more privileged district containing the city's major monuments and its imperial residence. Most of the population remained concentrated in the medina behind the Andalusian Wall in the northern section. In the 1850s, Moulay Abd ar-Rahman (r. 1822\u20131859) further developed and completed the Dar al-Makhzen palace in the southwest corner of this enclosure. At the end of the 19th century or beginning of the 20th century, the city had some 20,000 to 25,000 inhabitants.114\n20th century.\nFrench colonial rule.\nThe French invasion of Morocco began in the east with General Hubert Lyautey's occupation of Oujda in March 1907 and in the west with the Bombardment of Casablanca in August 1907. The Treaty of Fes established the protectorate in March 1912. Acting as French administrator of Morocco, Lyautey decided to relocate the country's capital from Fez to Rabat after the riots of 1912 following the Treaty of Fes. Lyautey appears to have had a personal affinity for Rabat. He argued that its coastal location was more pleasant and more accessible, and that its proximity to Casablanca, which he estimated would become the major economic center, would be advantageous. In 1913, Lyautey hired Henri Prost to design the \"Ville Nouvelle\" (Rabat's modern quarter) as an administrative sector, as he did in other major Moroccan cities.\nThe colonial period resulted in major economic changes as well as accelerated urbanization. Prior to this period, the major cities of Morocco had always been Fez and Marrakesh, while the coastal cities were relatively small. Census figures are not available for the early years of the Protectorate, but in 1912 Rabat and nearby Sal\u00e9 can be estimated to have had about 35,000 to 40,000 inhabitants at most, according to Janet Abu-Lughod.152 One early French survey, based on the number of houses rather than a formal census, estimated the population of Rabat to be 25,642. A formal census in 1921 counted the population as 33,714. Some of this growth was due to the immigration of foreigners. In 1921, 59% of the population were Moroccan Muslims and 10% were Moroccan Jews, while 21.4% were French nationals and another 10% were foreigners of other origin. Nearby Sal\u00e9, however, remained more homogenously Moroccan.154 Rabat's population grew to approximately 83,000 in 1936 and to approximately 156,000 in 1952.248\nPost World War II and independence.\nWhen Morocco achieved independence in 1956, Mohammed V, the then King of Morocco, chose to have the capital remain at Rabat. Rabat's growth continued unabated. The most important demographic shift after independence was the exodus of foreign nationals and their replacement by Moroccans, who gradually took over the jobs and functions that the foreigners had occupied. In the census of 1971, the population of Rabat had grown to around 368,000, of which only 3.5% were foreigners.\nFollowing World War II, the United States had established a military presence in Rabat at the former French air base. By the early 1950s, Rabat Sal\u00e9 Air Base was a U.S. Air Force installation hosting the 17th Air Force and the 5th Air Division, which oversaw forward basing for Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-47 Stratojet aircraft in the country. With the destabilization of French government in Morocco, and Moroccan independence in 1956, the government of Mohammed V wanted the U.S. Air Force to pull out of the SAC bases in Morocco, insisting on such action after American intervention in Lebanon in 1958. The United States agreed to leave as of December 1959, and was fully out of Morocco by 1963. SAC felt the Moroccan bases were much less critical with the long range capability of the B-52 Stratofortresses that were replacing the B-47s and with the completion of the USAF installations in Spain in 1959. With the USAF withdrawal from Rabat-Sal\u00e9 in the 1960s, the facility became a primary facility for the Royal Moroccan Air Force known as Air Base N\u00ba 1, a status it continues to hold.\nThe fifth Arab League summit took place in Rabat in 1969 to discuss the arson of Al-Aqsa Mosque by Australian citizen Denis Michael Rohan. In the same year, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an organization that aims to protect the interests of the Muslim world, was founded at a summit in Rabat. The 1974 Arab League summit was also held in Rabat. The summit recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. In 1985, the sixth edition of the Pan Arab Games was held in Rabat.\nIn 2015, the city became part of the Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra administrative region. On 28 February 2024, Asmaa Rhlalou declared her resignation, months after she sparked a controversy that called into doubt her authority and validity within the City Council.\nGeography.\nNeighbourhoods of Rabat.\nRabat is an administrative city. It has many shopping districts and residential neighbourhoods. The geographically spread out neighbourhoods are as follows:\nThe heart of the city consists of three parts: the Medina (old town); the Oudayas and Hassan both located to meet the Bou Regreg; and the Atlantic Ocean.\nTo the west, and along the waterfront, there is a succession of neighbourhoods.\nFirst, around the ramparts, there are the old neighbourhoods, Quartier l'Oc\u00e9an and Quartier les Orangers. Beyond that, a succession of mostly working-class districts: Diour Jamaa, Akkari, Yacoub El Mansour, Massira and Hay el Fath are the main parts of this axis. Hay el Fath, which ends this sequence, evolves into a middle-class neighbourhood.\nTo the east, along the Bou Regreg, the Youssoufia region (working and middle class) : Mabella; Taqaddoum; Hay Nahda (mostly middle class); Aviation (middle and upper middle class); and Rommani.\nBetween the two axes, from north to south, there are three main neighbourhoods (middle class to affluent): Agdal (Ward Building; a lively mix of residential and commercial buildings. The residents are predominantly upper middle class); Hay Riad (affluent villas; this neighbourhood has experienced a surge of momentum since the 2000s); and Souissi (lavish villas, embassies, well-off residential neighborhood).\nOn the outskirts of Souissi are a number of less dense regions mainly comprising large private houses to areas that seem out of the city.\nSubdivisions.\nThe prefecture is divided administratively into the following:\nClimate.\nRabat features a Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\") with warm to hot, dry summers and mild, damp winters. Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Rabat has a mild, temperate climate, shifting from cool in winter to warm days in the summer months. The nights are always cool (or cold in winter, it can reach sub sometimes), with daytime temperatures generally rising about . The winter highs typically reach only in December\u2013February. Summer daytime highs usually hover around , but may occasionally exceed during heat waves. Summer nights are usually pleasant and cool, ranging between and rarely exceeding . Rabat belongs to the sub-humid bioclimatic zone with an average annual precipitation of . The airport station is located about from the coastline, which will somewhat warm afternoons and cool nights down compared to a seaside location.\nCulture.\nThe biggest place for theatre is the Mohammed V Theatre in the centre of the town, which was opened in 1962. Construction on a new performing arts center, the Grand Theatre of Rabat, began in 2014. Designed by Zaha Hadid, it would reportedly be the largest theater in the Arab world and in Africa. Construction was completed in 2021, though as of October 2024, the building remained closed to the public.\nMany organizations are active in cultural and social issues. Orient-Occident Foundation and ONA Foundation are the biggest of these. An independent art scene is active in the city. L'appartement 22, which is the first independent space for visual arts created by Abdellah Karroum, opened in 2002 and introduced international and local artists. Other independent spaces opened few years after, such as Le Cube, also set up in a private space.\nMawazine.\nMawazine is a music festival in Rabat organized under the auspices of King Mohammed VI of Morocco. The festival was first held in 2001, with music groups, fans and spectators coming together in a week-long celebration of culture and music both locally and internationally. Musicians such as Scorpions, The Weeknd, Jennifer Lopez, Kanye West, Pitbull, Rihanna, Elton John, Stromae and many others have performed at the festival.\nMawazine was host to more than 2,500,000 people in 2013. Workshops are available for teaching dances and other arts. The festival is free. However, while most areas are free, there are those that require payment, specifically the smaller stages being the historical site of Chellah, the Mohammed V National Theater, and the Renaissance Cultural Center.\nPlaces of worship.\nThe places of worship are predominantly Muslim mosques. The oldest mosque in the city is the \"Old Mosque\" (\"Jama' al-'Atiqa\") in the Kasbah of the Udayas. It was originally founded during Abd al-Mu'min's construction of the kasbah in 1150, though its current form mostly dates from an 18th-century restoration. Other important mosques include the Great Mosque in the old medina, also known as the el-Kharrazin Mosque, and the As-Sunna Mosque in central Rabat, originally completed in 1785 by Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah.\nThe last remaining synagogues in Rabat are the Rabbi Shalom Zaoui synagogue and the Talmud Torah Synagogue. There are also Christian churches and temples, including an Evangelical church and St. Peter's Cathedral (\"Cath\u00e9drale de Saint-Pierre\"), which hosts the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rabat.\nMuseums and parks.\nThe Oudayas Museum (also formerly known as the National Museum of Jewellery) is housed in a pavilion residence built by Sultan Moulay Isma'il (r. 1672\u20131727) inside the Kasbah of the Udayas. It was first opened in 1915, making it one of the oldest public museums in Morocco. Its collections, augmented by private donations, feature diverse objects from throughout Morocco, mostly from the 18th to 20th centuries. In 2006 it became the National Museum of Jewellery, with exhibits focusing on the history of Moroccan jewellery. As of 2019 it was under renovations to be transformed into a new museum to be called \"Mus\u00e9e du caftan et de la parure\" ('Museum of the caftan and adornment').\nThe Museum of History and Civilizations (formerly the National Archeological Museum) showcases the history of Morocco through a collection of archeological artifacts from the Punic, Mauretanian, Roman, and Islamic periods. This includes a collection of ancient Roman bronze and marble statuary from sites such as Lixus, Volubilis, and Chellah, as well as coins, ceramics, and architectural fragments from the Islamic period.\nThe Rabat Zoo (officially called the Zoological Garden of Rabat) was opened in 1973, in part to house the lions that were previously kept at the Royal Palace. The lions are descended from the now-extinct Barbary lions. Since then the zoo has expanded to house some 1800 animals and has engaged in conservation efforts.\nThe Bank al-Maghrib Museum was inaugurated in 2002 and is housed at the Bank al-Maghrib building downtown. Its main exhibits include a collection of coins and currency from ancient times to the modern era, as well as a gallery of Orientialist art. The Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art was inaugurated in 2014.\nHistoric monuments.\nThe Kasbah of the Udayas (also spelled \"Kasbah of the Oudaias\") is the oldest part of the present-day city, built by the Almohads in the 12th century. It was later refortified and expanded by the corsairs and the 'Alawi dynasty in the 17th and 18th centuries. The kasbah is now a residential district with traditional houses painted white and blue on the outside. Its southern section includes the \"Andalusian Garden\", landscaped in the 20th century.\nThe city's historic walls were first built by the Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur and completed in 1197, with later additions in the 17th and 19th centuries. A number of monumental gates are found along the walls, the most notable being Bab er-Rouah. The other Almohad-era gates are Bab el-Had, Bab al-Alou, Bab Zaers, and Bab al-Hadid, though many of them were modified in more recent periods. The 17th-century Andalusian Wall, which divides the zone inside the Almohad walls, has five more gates: Bab Jdid (formerly Bab Teben, mostly demolished), Bab al-Bouiba, Bab Chellah, Bab Mellah, and Bab Diouana.\nThe old medina, located below the kasbah and above the line of the Andalusian Wall, contains many historic mosques and traditional houses. The rest of the area within the Almohad walls but south of the Andalusian Wall was largely built up in the 20th century when Rabat became the capital during the French Protectorate. These districts contain numerous public buildings and apartment blocs built in contemporary styles of that period, such as neo-Moorish (known as \"n\u00e9o-Mauresque\" or \"arabisant\" in French), Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and modern architecture. Examples of these include the Bank al-Maghrib building (built in the 1920s), the Central Post Office building (circa 1921, expanded in 1930s), the Parliament building (built in the 1920s), St.-Peter's Cathedral (inaugurated in 1921, with later additions), the Rabat-Ville train station (early 1920s), and some of the apartment blocs on \"Rue Gaza\" (built or begun in the 1930s), among others.199\nOverlooking the shores of the river is the Hassan Tower, a monumental unfinished minaret constructed by Ya'qub al-Mansur in the late 12th century. It was built for an enormous mosque planned as part of the larger city al-Mansur was constructing. Across from the tower today, at the southern end of the mosque's remains, is the Mausoleum of Mohammed V (d. 1961), which houses the remains of King Mohammed V and King Hassan II. The mausoleum, completed in 1971, was designed in a neo-Moorish or Moroccan revivalist style by Vietnamese architect Cong Vo Toan.\nA short distance south of the historic city walls is the archeological site of Chellah, a walled enclosure containing a 13th to 14th-century Marinid funerary and religious complex as well as the ruins of the Roman city of Sala Colonia. Across the river is the city of Sal\u00e9, which also preserves a historic medina. The medina of Sal\u00e9 includes monuments from the Marinid period such as Bab Mrissa and the Madrasa of Abu al-Hasan as well as landmarks from later periods.\nEducation.\nColleges and universities.\nPublic:\nPrivate: \nTransport.\nAir.\nRabat's main airport is Rabat\u2013Sal\u00e9 Airport.\nTrains.\nRabat is served by two principal railway stations run by the national rail service ONCF.\nRabat-Ville and Rabat Agdal are the two main inter-city stations, from which trains run south to Casablanca, Marrakesh and El Jadida, north to Tangier, or east to Meknes, Fez, Taza and Oujda.\nONCF operates the Le Bouregreg urban rail for Rabat-Sal\u00e9 agglomeration. Marrakesh is a 4 hr journey, Fez 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 hr on an express train and 3&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 hr on other trains and Casablanca 1 hr.\nTram.\nThe Rabat\u2013Sal\u00e9 tramway was the first tramway network in Morocco and connects Rabat with Sal\u00e9 across the river. It was opened on 11 May 2011 after a construction cost of 3.6 billion MAD. The network was constructed by Alstom Citadis and is operated by Transdev. As of February 2022, the network had two lines with a total length of and 43 stations. In 2023, an extension of the network was being planned and is due to be completed by 2028.\nCity buses.\nAfter some years of neglect as investment was directed at the tramway, the existing operator, STAREO, was displaced in 2019. A contract was awarded to Alsa-City Bus, a joint venture between Moroccan company City Bus and Spanish company Alsa, a subsidiary of the Mobico Group. The new operator took over in July 2019 with a commitment to three hundred and fifty new buses. These will comprise 102 Mercedes-Benz and 248 Scania vehicles. The contract covers a 15-year period, renewable for seven years, and promises approximately 10 billion MAD investment into the bus transport system in the region.\nSport.\nThe Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium (Arabic: \u0645\u0644\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0647) is a multi-purpose stadium. The new venue as of 2025 replaced the original Prince Moulay Abdellah stadium on the same site. The first stadium was built in 1983 and was the home ground of ASFAR (football club) and was mostly used for football matches, and it can also stage athletics competitions. The 1983 stadium held 52,000 spectators, whilst the new stadium has a seating capacity of 67,800 and will be used as a multi-purpose venue to host cultural events as well as sports. Since 2008, the 1983 stadium hosted the Meeting International Mohammed VI d'Athl\u00e9tisme de Rabat. It is named after Prince Moulay Abdellah of Morocco.\nRabat hosted the 2019 African Games after Malabo, Equatorial Guinea was stripped of hosting due to economic matters. It was the first time the African Games were hosted by Morocco. It is one of the host cities for the 2030 FIFA World Cup.\nFootball.\nRabat's most popular sport club is the association football clubs ASFAR and FUS de Rabat. Well known in the continental competitions. AS FAR have won 2 major African titles, including 1 CAF Champions League and 1 CAF Confederation Cup.

It is a small and compact urban settlement, in the Saint George parish and surrounded by the Caribbean Sea, the Roseau River and Morne Bruce. Built on the site of the ancient Island Carib village of Sairi, it is the oldest and most important urban settlement on the island of Dominica.\nIt is on the west (leeward) coast of Dominica and has a combination of modern and colonial French architecture.\nRoseau is Dominica's most important port for foreign trade. Some exports include bananas, bay oil, vegetables, grapefruit, oranges, and cocoa. The service sector is also a large part of the local economy. There are several private institutions registered in Dominica, like Ross University, International University for Graduate Studies, All Saints University, New World University, and Western Orthodox University.\nThere is a prominent diocese called Roman Catholic Diocese of Roseau.\nHistory.\nThe city of Roseau sits on an alluvial fan formed hundreds of years ago as the Roseau River meandered across the area from what is now known as Newtown to its current location. Over the last 2,000 years, Amerindians migrating through the islands settled the area attracted by the nearby river. With the arrival of the Europeans in the 16th and 17th centuries, a small settlement was established by the French who, in their tradition of naming places after what they found there, used their name for the river reeds (called \"roseaux\" in French), that grew abundantly along its banks. A plan was created for the settlement that mirrored examples in France where streets extended from a central point \u2013 what is today the Old Market \u2013 and spread out to the rest of the settlement.\nConflict raged between the French and the British over the area on several occasions. In 1699, the French built a fort to protect Roseau. In 1770, the British built Fort Young in place of the previous fort. In 1778, the French invaded Dominica, capturing Fort Young and Roseau and taking control of the island. In 1784, Dominica was returned to British control under the Treaty of Paris. The population of Roseau, in the census of June 1844, was 3,954.\nBy the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the British set out plans for the city that included fortifications and government structures, the grid street system, and blocks and new urban areas to the north and south, known today as Potter's Ville and Newtown. Goodwill was established in the 1950s and Bath Estate in the early 1980s. Since then several new semi-urban settlements \u2013 such as Stock Farm, Castle Comfort, and Wall House \u2013 have been constructed around the existing ones. Some older settlements like Fond Cole and Canefield nowadays belong to the semi-urban area around Roseau.\nThe French influence can still be seen today, however, in its architecture and crooked streets that extend from the Old Market Plaza. Examples of the English influence are evident in architecture and street names.\nClimate and scenery.\nRoseau's nearby scenery (mostly in its so-called valley) includes Boiling Lake, east, in the Morne Trois Pitons National Park, waterfalls, thermal springs, and scenic plateaus.\nMorne Bruce provides panoramic views of most of downtown Roseau and north toward Woodbridge Bay deepwater port and Fond Cole. From Morne Bruce there are views of the Botanic Gardens at its base as well as the Caribbean Sea which look quite spectacular when cruise liners are in port.\nRoseau's climate is a tropical monsoon climate, featuring relatively constant temperatures throughout the year with average high temperatures generally between and average low temperatures between . Rainfall is common throughout the year, with the city seeing an annual average nearly . Roseau features a noticeably drier stretch from February through April, though each of these months on average sees at least of rain.\nArchitecture.\nThe central district of Roseau is tightly packed with small and large houses and even larger modern concrete structures. There is little green or open space in the city; there is even less today, as many of the courtyards that were once commonplace are giving way to office space. The district is, however, framed in every direction by natural elements. The sea and the river provide water elements while the Botanical gardens and the Government House gardens frame the city with green space. These elements are rare in the Caribbean. No other centre in the region has such extensive botanical gardens with such central location, and the Roseau River is among the largest that flow through any Caribbean capital.\nThe urban structure of Central Roseau is based on an irregular grid system of miniature proportions, making it a highly illegible city. Even though the grid area is not extensive, it is relatively easy for a visitor to get lost. The grid area has some 80 blocks in an area of . In comparison, the grid areas of Kingstown and Castries \u2014 capitals of Saint Vincent and Saint Lucia \u2014 have some 50 and 60 blocks in the areas of over . The average block size in Central Roseau is thus some \u2153 hectare (1 acre), i.e., about half of the figure of Central Kingstown.\nThere are some fine examples of West Indian architecture in Roseau. The ones that stand out the most are the French Colonial style and the vernacular form. Much of the French influence can be found along King George V Street. Around the city there are good examples of the English influence in large colonial town houses and colonial public/government buildings.\nThe churches in Roseau are fine examples of Europe in Dominica with a bit of creolization. The Roman Catholic Cathedral stands prominent in Gothic Romanesque revival and the Anglican Church on Victoria Street in Georgian style.\nCity life.\nBecause of the suburban sprawl, few people live in Central Roseau, but more of them commute daily. Motorized vehicles pour into the central district introducing a mode of point-to-point interaction in an environment that was created for multiple use. As elders said, first there were no streets but just a space between the buildings. The streets of Roseau, and especially those of its central district, are not only ways to move from place to place but they are places themselves. They are used as gardens, playing fields, and social meeting places.\nThe Botanical Gardens on the fringes of the central district are mostly used by children.\nSports and recreation.\nIn Roseau, there are many opportunities for recreation. Many people seek the tranquility and cool of the Botanical Gardens as a getaway on Sunday afternoons and at lunch. It is a popular venue for local cricket matches and sports training. Football is popular; there are several pitches throughout the city (at Newtown, Potters Ville, and Bath Estate), as well as in the sports stadium at Windsor Park.\nSporting facilities and infrastructure.\nThere are dedicated sports facilities around the city. Private tennis courts are on High Street; netball and basketball courts abound in the major high schools. These are complemented by community facilities at Goodwill. A dedicated netball and basketball stadium is at Stockfarm near the Dominica State College.\nIn 2007, Windsor Park, a cricket stadium which is also home to the Dominica national football team, was completed with a donation of EC$33\u00a0million from the government of the People's Republic of China.\nElsewhere it is not uncommon to find that a section of the street, sidewalk or the beach has been adapted for makeshift games of cricket or football.\nOther popular sports include netball, basketball, rounders and (to a much lesser extent) tennis.\nAccommodations and infrastructure.\nThere are no world-famous hotel chains in the city. The most famous is the Fort Young Hotel. In addition there are several small family owned establishments in and on the outskirts of Roseau.\nDominica Broadcasting Corporation, the national radio station, and two private radio stations are in the capital.\nNon-governmental organizations.\nRoseau is home to service clubs including, Kiwanis, Rotary and Lions. There are other organizations such as the local humane society and conservation society. ChildFund International USA has an office in Roseau from where it runs its child centered development programs for Dominica and Saint Vincent.\nThe Dominica Association of Industry and Commerce, Waitukubuli Ecological Foundation, Dominica Tourism Association and others are based in the city.\nThe city is home to several labour organizations including the Dominica Amalgamated Workers' Union, the Dominica Public Service Union, the Dominica Trade Union, the National Workers' Union and the Waterfront and Allied Workers' Union.\nTransportation.\nAs the most important town on the island and hub of all business activity, the city is a central point of the road networks on the island. It is an important link between northern, eastern, and southern bound traffic.\nRoseau is served by Canefield Airport, a nearby small aircraft airport that provides direct links to nearby islands, as well as the larger Douglas\u2013Charles Airport to the north. The ferry terminal provides direct links to the neighbouring Guadeloupe to the north and Martinique and St. Lucia to the south.\nThere are no rail or subway systems.\nEducation.\nRoseau has been the historical centre of education on the island. There are six secondary schools in the city as well as eight primary schools. A community college, the Dominica State College, is in Roseau. There are two private medical schools, All Saints School of Medicine and Ross University School of Medicine, and a private university, Western Orthodox University.\nEmbassies and consulates.\nSeveral embassies are in the city. They include the Brazilian, the Chinese, the Cuban, and the Venezuelan embassies, with a couple of other consulates around the city.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Yangon was the capital of Myanmar until 2005 and served as such until 2006, when the military government relocated the administrative functions to the purpose-built capital city of Naypyidaw in north central Myanmar. With over five million people, Yangon is Myanmar's most populous city and its most important commercial centre.\nYangon boasts the largest number of colonial-era buildings in Southeast Asia, and has a unique colonial-era urban core that is remarkably intact. The colonial-era commercial core is centred around the Sule Pagoda, which is reputed to be over 2,000 years old. The city is also home to the gilded Shwedagon Pagoda \u2013 Myanmar's most sacred and famous Buddhist pagoda.\nYangon suffers from deeply inadequate infrastructure, especially compared to other major cities in Southeast Asia, such as Jakarta, Bangkok or Hanoi. Though many historic residential and commercial buildings have been renovated throughout central Yangon, most satellite towns that ring the city continue to be profoundly impoverished and lack basic infrastructure.\nEtymology and pronunciation.\nThe name \"Yangon\" () is derived from the combination of the Burmese words () and (), which mean 'enemies' and 'run out of', respectively. This word combination can be translated as 'End of Strife'.\nThe name is pronounced in British English and in American English.\nThe English romanisation, \"Rangoon\", is based on the Rakhine dialect, and pronounced in English.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nYangon was founded as \"Dagon\" in the early 11th century (c.\u20091028\u20131043) by the Mon people, who inhabited Lower Burma at that time. Dagon became an important pilgrimage pagoda town, starting in the 14th century, during the Hanthawaddy kingdom. Notable governors of Dagon included Princess Maha Dewi, who ruled the town from 1364 to 1392, and her grandniece, Shin Saw Pu, who later became the only female queen regnant in Burmese history. Queen Saw Pu built a palace next to the Shwedagon Pagoda in the town in 1460 and spent her semi-retired life at that palace until her death in 1471.\nIn 1755, King Alaungpaya, the founder of the Konbaung dynasty captured Dagon, added settlements around it, and called the enlarged town \"Yangon\". In the 1790s, the East India Company opened a factory in Yangon. The estimated population of Yangon in 1823 was about 30,000. The British captured Yangon during the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824\u201326), but returned the city to Burmese rule after the war. The city was destroyed by a fire in 1841.\nColonial Rangoon (1852\u20131948).\nThe British captured Yangon and all of Lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, and subsequently transformed Yangon into the commercial and political hub of British Burma. After the war, the British moved the capital of British Burma from Moulmein (present-day Mawlamyine) to Yangon. Based on the design by army engineer Lt. Alexander Fraser, the British constructed a new city on a grid plan on delta land, bounded to the east by the Pazundaung Creek and to the south and west by the Yangon River. Yangon became the capital of all British-ruled Burma after the British had captured Upper Burma in the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885. By the 1890s Yangon's increasing population and commerce gave birth to prosperous residential suburbs to the north of Royal Lake (Kandawgyi) and Inya Lake. The British also established hospitals including Rangoon General Hospital and colleges including Rangoon University.\nAfter the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British sent Bahadur Shah II, the last Mughal emperor, to Yangon to live in exile.\nColonial Yangon, with its spacious parks and lakes and mix of modern buildings and traditional wooden architecture, was known as \"the garden city of the East\". By the early 20th century, Yangon had public services and infrastructure on par with London.\nBefore World War II, about 55% of Yangon's population of 500,000 was Indian or South Asian, and only about a third was Bamar (Burman). Karens, Chinese, Anglo-Burmese, and others made up the rest.\nAfter World War I, Yangon became the center of the Burmese independence movement, with leftist Rangoon University students leading the way. Three nationwide strikes against British rule in 1920, 1936, and 1938 all began in Yangon. Yangon was under Japanese occupation (1942\u201345), and incurred heavy damage during World War II. The city was retaken by the Allies in May 1945. Yangon became the capital of the Union of Burma on 4 January 1948 when the country gained independence from British rule.\nContemporary Yangon (1948\u2013present).\nSoon after Burma's independence in 1948, many colonial-era names of streets and parks were changed to more nationalistic Burmese names. In 1989, the military junta changed the city's English name to \"Yangon\", along with many other changes in English transliteration of Burmese names. (The changes have not been accepted by many Burmese who consider the junta unfit to make such changes, nor by many publications and news bureaus, including, most notably, the BBC and foreign nations including the United Kingdom and the United States.)\nSince independence, Yangon has expanded outwards. Successive governments have built satellite towns such as Thaketa, North Okkalapa and South Okkalapa in the 1950s to Hlaingthaya, Shwepyitha and South Dagon in the 1980s. Today, Greater Yangon encompasses an area covering nearly .\nDuring Ne Win's isolationist rule (1962\u201388), Yangon's infrastructure deteriorated through poor maintenance and did not keep up with its increasing population. In the 1990s, the military government's more open market policies attracted domestic and foreign investment, bringing a modicum of modernity to the city's infrastructure. Some inner city residents were forcibly relocated to new satellite towns. Many colonial-period buildings were demolished to make way for high-rise hotels, office buildings, and shopping malls, leading the city government to place about 200 notable colonial-period buildings under the Yangon City Heritage List in 1996. Major building programs have resulted in six new bridges and five new highways linking the city to its industrial back country. Still, much of Yangon remains without basic municipal services such as 24-hour electricity and regular garbage collection.\nYangon has become much more indigenous Burmese in its ethnic make-up since independence. After independence, many South Asians and Anglo-Burmese left. Many more South Asians were forced to leave during the 1960s by Ne Win's xenophobic government. Nevertheless, sizeable South Asian and Chinese communities still exist in Yangon. The Anglo-Burmese have effectively disappeared, having left the country or intermarried with other Burmese groups.\nYangon was the centre of major anti-government protests in 1974, 1988 and 2007. In particular, the 8888 Uprising resulted in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of Burmese civilians, many of them in Yangoon where hundreds of thousands of people flooded into the streets of the former capital city. The Saffron Revolution saw mass shootings and the use of crematoria in Yangoon by the Burmese government to erase evidence of their crimes against monks, unarmed protesters, journalists and students.\nThe city's streets saw bloodshed each time as protesters were gunned down by the government, most notably during the 1988, 2007, and the 2021 mass protests, all of which were started in Yangon itself, signifying its importance as the cultural centre of Burma.\nIn May 2008, Cyclone Nargis hit Yangon. While the city had few human casualties, three-quarters of Yangon's industrial infrastructure was destroyed or damaged, with losses estimated at US$800\u00a0million.\nIn November 2005, the military government designated Naypyidaw, north of Yangon, as the new administrative capital, and moved much of the government to the newly developed city. Yangon remains the largest city and the most important commercial, economic and cultural center of Myanmar. On 7 May 2005, a series of coordinated bombings occurred in the city of Yangon, Myanmar. Eleven people were killed in the attack, and one of the 162 people that were injured was a member of the LCMS mission team to Myanmar.\nIn the 2020s, life in Yangon was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and 2021 coup d'\u00e9tat. The city was the location of mass protests in response to the coup. The pandemic and protests prompted authorities to enforce numerous lockdowns and curfews. The city's economy subsequently slowed. \nGeography.\nYangon is located in Lower Burma (Myanmar) at the convergence of the Yangon and Bago Rivers about 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) away from the Gulf of Martaban at 16\u00b048' North, 96\u00b009' East (16.8, 96.15). Its standard time zone is UTC/GMT +6:30 hours.\nIt is located 23 metres above sea level. Due to its location on the Irrawaddy Delta, intertidal flat ecosystems occur adjacent to the city.\nClimate.\nYangon has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system. The city features a lengthy wet season from May through October where a substantial amount of rainfall is received; and a dry season from November through April, where little rainfall is seen. It is primarily due to the heavy rainfall received during the rainy season that makes Yangon fall under the tropical monsoon climate category. During the course of year 1961 to 1990s, average temperatures show little variance, with average highs ranging from and average lows ranging from .\nYangon is prone to tropical cyclones every time of the year. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis made landfall as a Category 4 cyclone, making it the worst cyclone on the country's record.\nCityscape.\nUntil the mid-1990s, Yangon remained largely constrained to its traditional peninsula setting between the Bago, Yangon, and Hlaing Rivers. People moved in, but little of the city moved out. Maps from 1944 show little development north of Inya Lake and areas that are now layered in cement and stacked with houses were then virtual backwaters. Since the late 1980s, however, the city began a rapid spread north to where Yangon International Airport now stands. But the result is a stretching tail on the city, with the downtown area well removed from its geographic centre. The city's area has steadily increased from in 1901 to in 1940 to in 1974, to in 1985, and to in 2008.\nArchitecture.\nDowntown Yangon is known for its leafy avenues and fin-de-si\u00e8cle architecture. The former British colonial capital has the highest number of colonial period buildings in south-east Asia. Downtown Yangon is still mainly made up of decaying colonial buildings. The former High Court, the former Secretariat buildings, the former St. Paul's English High School and the Strand Hotel are excellent examples of the bygone era. Most downtown buildings from this era are four-story mix-use (residential and commercial) buildings with ceilings, allowing for the construction of mezzanines. Despite their less-than-perfect conditions, the buildings remain highly sought after and most expensive in the city's property market.\nIn 1996, the Yangon City Development Committee created a Yangon City Heritage List of old buildings and structures in the city that cannot be modified or torn down without approval. In 2012, the city of Yangon imposed a 50-year moratorium on demolition of buildings older than 50 years. The Yangon Heritage Trust, an NGO started by Thant Myint-U, aims to create heritage areas in Downtown, and attract investors to renovate buildings for commercial use.\nA latter-day hallmark of Yangon is the eight-story apartment building. (In Yangon parlance, a building with no elevators (lifts) is called an apartment building and one with elevators is called a condominium. Condos which have to invest in a local power generator to ensure 24-hour electricity for the elevators are beyond the reach of most Yangonites.) Found throughout the city, eight-story apartment buildings provide inexpensive housing for many Yangonites. The apartments are usually eight stories high (including the ground floor) mainly because city regulations, until February 2008, required that all buildings higher than or eight stories to install lifts. The code calls for elevators in buildings higher than or six stories, likely ushering in the era of the six-story apartment building. Although most apartment buildings were built only within the last 20 years, they look much older and rundown due to shoddy construction and lack of proper maintenance.\nUnlike other major Asian cities, Yangon does not have any skyscrapers. This is due to rule that no building should be more than 75% the height above sea level of Shwedagon Pagoda, which rises about . For instance, in 2015, a luxury housing project was cancelled due to its proximity to Shwedagon Pagoda. Critics of the project claimed that the project could cause structural damage to the pagoda. Aside from a few high-rise hotels and office towers, most high-rise buildings (usually 10 stories and up) are \"condos\" scattered across prosperous neighbourhoods north of downtown such as Bahan, Dagon, Kamayut and Mayangon.\nOlder satellite towns such as Thaketa, North Okkalapa, and South Okkalapa are lined mostly with one to two-story detached houses with access to the city's electricity grid. Newer satellite towns such as North Dagon and South Dagon are in a grid layout. The satellite towns\u2014old or new\u2014receive little or no municipal services.\nRoad layout.\nDowntown Yangon's road layout follows a grid pattern, based on four types of roads:\nThe east\u2013west grid of central was laid out by British military engineers Fraser and Montgomerie after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The city was later developed by the Public Works Department and Bengal Corps of Engineers. The pattern of south to north roads is as follows: one broad wide road, two narrow streets, one mid-size street, two more narrow streets, and then another broad wide road. This order is repeated from west to east. The narrow streets are numbered; the medium and broad roads are named.\nFor example, the Lanmadaw Road is followed by -wide 17th and 18th streets then the medium Sint-Oh-Dan Road, the 30-foot 19th and 20th streets, followed by another wide Latha Road, followed again by the two numbered small roads 21st and 22nd streets, and so on.\nThe roads running parallel west to east were the Strand Road, Merchant Road, Maha Bandula (n\u00e9e Dalhousie) Road, Anawrahta (Fraser) Road, and Bogyoke Aung San (Montgomerie) Road.\nParks and gardens.\nThe largest and best maintained parks in Yangon are located around Shwedagon Pagoda. To the south-east of the gilded stupa is the most popular recreational area in the city \u2013 Kandawgyi Lake. The 150-acre (61-ha) lake is surrounded by the 110-acre (45-ha) Kandawgyi Nature Park, and the 69.25-acre (28-ha) Yangon Zoological Gardens, which consists of a zoo, an aquarium and an amusement park, and Bogyoke Aung San Park. West of the pagoda towards the former Hluttaw (Parliament) complex is the 130-acre (53-ha) People's Square and Park, the former parading ground on important national days when Yangon was the capital. A few miles north of the pagoda lies the 37-acre (15-ha) Inya Lake Park \u2013 a favourite hangout place of Yangon University students, and a well-known place of romance in Burmese popular culture.\nHlawga National Park and Allied War Memorial at the outskirts of the city are popular day-trip destinations with tourists.\nWater supply.\nYangon's water is supplied by four reservoirs managed by the YCDC: Hlawga, Gyobyu, Phugyi, and Ngamoeyeik Reservoirs, all of which are scattered throughout Yangon Region. Kandawgyi and Inya Lakes no longer function as reservoirs for the city.\nAdministration.\nYangon is administered by the Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC). YCDC also coordinates urban planning. The city is made up of 33 townships and is part of Yangon Region. Yangon Region is divided into districts, which overlap with the city's jurisdiction. The current mayor of Yangon is Maung Maung Soe. Each township is administered by a Township Development Committee, alongside local leaders who make decisions regarding city beautification and infrastructure. \"Myo-thit\" (lit. \"New Towns\", or satellite towns) are not within such jurisdictions.\nIn 2022, the districts of Yangon Region were reorganised giving Yangon city nine newly formed districts, as well as parts of the newly formed Twante District.\nList of Yangon City Townships by District:\nYangon is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21.\nTransport.\nYangon is Burma's main domestic and international hub for air, rail, and ground transportation.\nAir.\nYangon International Airport, located 12\u00a0miles (19\u00a0km) from downtown, is the country's main gateway for domestic and international air travel. The airport has three terminals, known as T1, T2 and T3 which is also known as Domestic. It has direct flights to major cities in Asia, such as Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Kolkata, and Dubai. Although domestic airlines offer service to about forty domestic locations, most flights are to tourist destinations such as Bagan, Mandalay, Heho and Ngapali, and to the capital Naypyidaw.\nRailways.\nYangon Central Railway Station is the main terminus of Myanmar Railways' rail network whose reach covers Upper Myanmar (Naypyidaw, Mandalay, Shwebo), upcountry (Myitkyina), Shan hills (Taunggyi, Lashio) and the Taninthayi coast (Mawlamyine, Dawei).\nYangon Circular Railway operates a 39-station commuter rail network that connects Yangon's satellite towns. The system is heavily used by the local populace, selling about 150,000 tickets daily. The popularity of the commuter line has jumped since the government reduced petrol subsidies in August 2007.\nIn 2017 the government of Japan provided more than US$200\u00a0million in finance to assist with a range of works including developing and maintaining the Yangon circular railway line, purchasing new carriages and upgrading signalling.\nRapid transit.\nThe Yangon Urban Mass Rapid Transit is a proposed rapid transit system, due to begin construction in 2022 and be complete by 2027.\nBuses and cars.\nYangon has a road network of all types (tar, concrete and dirt) in March 2011. Many of the roads are in poor condition and not wide enough to accommodate an increasing number of cars. The vast majority of Yangon residents cannot afford a car and rely on an extensive network of buses to get around. Over 300 public and private bus lines operate about 6,300 crowded buses around the city, carrying over 4.4\u00a0million passengers a day. All buses and 80% of the taxis in Yangon run on compressed natural gas (CNG), following the 2005 government decree to save money on imported petroleum. Highway buses to other cities depart from Dagon Ayeyar Highway Bus Terminal for Irrawaddy delta region and Aung Mingala Highway Bus Terminal for other parts of the country.\nMotor transportation in Yangon is highly expensive for most of its citizens. As the government allows only a few thousand cars to be imported each year in a country with over 50 million people, car prices in Yangon (and in Burma) are among the highest in the world. In July 2008, the two most popular cars in Yangon, 1986/87 Nissan Sunny Super Saloon and 1988 Toyota Corolla SE Limited, cost the equivalent of about US$20,000 and US$29,000 respectively. A sports utility vehicle, imported for the equivalent of around US$50,000, goes for US$250,000. Illegally imported unregistered cars are cheaper \u2013 typically about half the price of registered cars. Nonetheless, car usage in Yangon is on the rise, a sign of rising incomes for some, and already causes much traffic congestion in highway-less Yangon's streets. In 2011, Yangon had about 300,000 registered motor vehicles in addition to an unknown number of unregistered ones.\nWithin Yangon city limits, it is illegal to drive trishaws, bicycles, and motorcycles. Since February 2010, pick-up truck bus lines have been forbidden to run in six townships of central Yangon, namely Latha, Lanmadaw, Pabedan, Kyauktada, Botahtaung and Pazundaung Townships. In May 2003, a ban on using car horns was implemented in six townships of Downtown Yangon to reduce noise pollution. In April 2004, the car horn ban was expanded to cover the entire city.\nOn 16 January 2017, as part of public transport reforms, city bus network system Yangon Bus Service (YBS) was created by the Yangon Region Transport Authority. On 20 May 2021, YRTA was reorganised as Yangon Region Transport Committee (YRTC). YBS is claimed to be a disabled-friendly bus service and have a card payment system. Since January 2019, passengers can either pay with cash or smart cards through the machines installed near the driver seat on the bus. As of January 2022, it is claimed that card machines are installed on more than 1900 buses. Ride hailing services operated by private corporations such as Uber and Grab are also available in Yangon today.\nRiver.\nYangon's four main passenger jetties, all located on or near downtown waterfront, mainly serve local ferries across the river to Dala and Thanlyin, and regional ferries to the Irrawaddy delta. The 22-mile (35\u00a0km) Twante Canal was the quickest route from Yangon to the Irrawaddy delta until the 1990s when roads between Yangon and the Irrawaddy Division became usable year-round. While passenger ferries to the delta are still used, those to Upper Burma via the Irrawaddy river are now limited mostly to tourist river cruises. In October 2017, a New Yangon Water Bus was launched.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nYangon is the most populous city by far in Myanmar. According to the 2014 census, the city had a population of 5.16\u00a0million. The city's population grew sharply after 1948 as many people (mainly, the indigenous Burmese) from other parts of the country moved into the newly built satellite towns of North Okkalapa, South Okkalapa, and Thaketa in the 1950s and East Dagon, North Dagon and South Dagon in the 1990s. Immigrants have founded their regional associations (such as Mandalay Association, Mawlamyaing Association, etc.) in Yangon for networking purposes. The government's decision to move the nation's administrative capital to Naypyidaw has drained an unknown number of civil servants away from Yangon.\nYangon is the most ethnically diverse city in the country. While Indians formed the slight majority prior to World War II, today, the majority of the population is of indigenous Bamar (Burman) descent. Large communities of Indians Burmese and the Chinese Burmese exist, especially in the traditional downtown neighbourhoods. A large number of Rakhine and Karen people also live in the city.\nBurmese is the principal language of the city. English is by far the preferred second language of the educated class. In recent years, however, the prospect of overseas job opportunities has enticed some to study other languages: Mandarin Chinese is most popular, followed by Japanese, and French.\nReligions.\nThe primary religions practised in Yangon are Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Shwedagon Pagoda is a famous religious landmark in the city.\nMedia.\nYangon is the country's hub for the movie, music, advertising, newspaper, and book publishing industries, and is the country's cultural center. All media is heavily regulated by the military government. Television broadcasting is off-limits to the private sector. All media content must first be approved by the government's media censor board, Press Scrutiny and Registration Division.\nMost television channels in the country are broadcast from Yangon. MRTV and Myawaddy TV are the two main channels, providing Burmese-language news and entertainment programs. Other special interest channels are MWD-1 and MWD-2, MITV, the English-language channel that targets overseas audiences via satellite and via internet, MRTV-4 and Channel 7 (Yangon) are with a focus on non-formal education programs and movies, and Movie 5, a pay-TV channel specialising in broadcasting foreign movies.\nYangon has three radio stations. Myanmar Radio is the national radio service and broadcasts mostly in Burmese and in English during specific times. Pop culture-oriented Yangon City FM and Mandalay City FM radio stations specialise in Burmese and English pop music, entertainment programs, live celebrity interviews, etc. New radio channels such as Shwe FM and Pyinsawaddy FM can also be tuned with the city area.\nNearly all print media and industries are based out of Yangon. All three national newspapers \u2013 two Burmese language dailies \"Myanma Alin\" () and \"Kyemon\" (), and the English language \"The New Light of Myanmar\" \u2013 are published by the government. Semi-governmental \"The Myanmar Times\" weekly, published in Burmese and in English, is mainly geared for Yangon's expatriate community. There are over 20 special interest journals and magazines covering sports, fashion, finance, crime, and literature (but never politics).\nAccess to foreign media is extremely difficult. Satellite television in Yangon, and in Burma, is very expensive as the government imposes an annual registration fee of Ks.10,00,000/-, equivalent to around U$600/year. Certain foreign newspapers and periodicals such as the \"Straits Times\" can be found only in a few (mostly downtown) bookstores. Internet access in Yangon, which has the best telecommunication infrastructure in the country, is slow and erratic at best, and the Burmese government implements one of the world's most restrictive regimes of internet control. International text messaging and voice messaging was permitted only in August 2008.\nCommunication.\nCommon facilities taken for granted elsewhere are luxury prized items in Yangon and Burma. The price of a GSM mobile phone was about K1.1\u00a0million in August 2008. In 2007, the country of 55 million had only 775,000 phone lines (including 275,000 mobile phones), and 400,000 computers. Even in Yangon, which has the best infrastructure, the estimated telephone penetration rate was only 6% at the end of 2004, and the official waiting time for a telephone line was 3.6 years. Most people cannot afford a computer and have to use the city's numerous Internet cafes to access a heavily restricted internet, and a heavily censored local intranet. According to official statistics, in July 2010, the country had over 400,000 internet users, with the vast majority hailing from just two cities, Yangon and Mandalay. Although internet access was available in 42 cities across the country, the number of users outside the two main cities was just over 10,000.\nLifestyle.\nYangon's property market is the most expensive in the country and beyond the reach of most Yangonites. Most rent outside the centre and few can afford to rent such apartments. (In 2008, rents for a typical apartments in the centre and vicinity range between K70,000 and K150,000 and those for high end condos between K200,000 and K500,000.)\nYangon is home to pagoda festivals (\"paya pwe\"), held during dry-season months (November \u2013 March). The most famous of all, the Shwedagon Pagoda Festival in March, attracts thousands of pilgrims from around the country.\nYangon's museums are the domain of tourists and rarely visited by the locals.\nMost of Yangon's larger hotels offer nightlife entertainment, geared towards tourists and the well-to-do Burmese. Some hotels offer traditional Burmese performing arts shows complete with a traditional Burmese orchestra.\nSports.\nAs the city has the best sporting facilities in the country, most national-level annual sporting tournaments such as track and field, football, volleyball, tennis and swimming are held in Yangon. The 40,000-seat Aung San Stadium and the 32,000-seat Thuwunna Stadium are the main venues for the popular annual State and Division football tournament. Until April 2009, the now-defunct Myanmar Premier League, consisted of 16 Yangon-based clubs, played all its matches in Yangon stadiums, and attracted little interest from the general public or commercial success despite the enormous popularity of football in Burma. Most Yangonites prefer watching European football on satellite TV. Teams such as Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City are among the favourite European teams among the Yangonites. It remains to be seen whether the Myanmar National League, the country's first professional football league, and its Yangon-based club Yangon United FC will attract a sufficient following in the country's most important media market.\nYangon is also home to annual the Myanmar Open golf tournament, and the Myanmar Open tennis tournament. The city hosted the 1961 and 1969 South East Asian Games. During colonial times, cricket was played mostly by British officials in the city. First-class cricket was played in the city in January 1927 when the touring Marylebone Cricket Club played Burma and the Rangoon Gymkhana. Two grounds were used to host these matches, the BAA Ground and the Gymkhana Ground. These matches mark the only time Burma and Rangoon Gymkhana have appeared in first-class cricket, and the only time first-class cricket has been played in Burma. After independence cricket all but died out in the country.\nYangon has a growing population of skateboarders, as documented in the films Altered Focus: Burma and Youth of Yangon. German non-profit organization Make Life Skate Life has received permission from the Yangon City Development Committee to construct a concrete skatepark at Thakin Mya park in downtown. The park was completed in 2015 and is available free of charge to anyone in the city.\nEconomy.\nYangon is the country's main center for trade, industry, real estate, media, entertainment and tourism. The city represents about one fifth of the national economy. According to official statistics for FY 2010\u20132011, the size of the economy of Yangon Region was 8.93\u00a0trillion kyats, or 23% of the national GDP.\nThe city is Lower Burma's main trading hub for all kinds of merchandise \u2013 from basic foodstuffs to used cars although commerce continues to be hampered by the city's severely underdeveloped banking industry and communication infrastructure. Bayinnaung Market is the largest wholesale center in the country for rice, beans and pulses, and other agricultural commodities. Much of the country's legal imports and exports go through Thilawa Port, the largest and busiest port in Burma. There is also a great deal of informal trade, especially in street markets that exist alongside street platforms of Downtown Yangon's townships. However, on 17 June 2011, the YCDC announced that street vendors, who had previously been allowed to legally open shop at 3\u00a0 pm, would be prohibited from selling on the streets, and permitted to sell only in their townships of residence. Since 1 December 2009, high-density polyethylene plastic bags have been banned by city authorities.\nManufacturing accounts for a sizeable share of employment. At least 14 light industrial zones ring Yangon, directly employing over 150,000 workers in 4,300 factories in early 2010. The city is the centre of country's garment industry which exported US$292\u00a0million in 2008/9 fiscal year. More than 80 percent of factory workers in Yangon work on a day-to-day basis. Most are young women between 15 and 27 years of age who come from the countryside in search of a better life. The manufacturing sector suffers from both structural problems (e.g. chronic power shortages) and political problems (e.g. economic sanctions). In 2008, Yangon's 2500 factories alone needed about 120 MW of power; yet, the entire city received only about 250 MW of the 530 MW needed. Chronic power shortages limit the factories' operating hours between 8\u00a0am and 6\u00a0pm.\nConstruction is a major source of employment. The construction industry has been negatively affected by the move of state apparatus and civil servants to Naypyidaw, new regulations introduced in August 2009 requiring builders to provide at least 12 parking spaces in every new high-rise building, and the general poor business climate. As of January 2010, the number of new high-rise building starts approved in 2009\u20132010 was only 334, compared to 582 in 2008\u20132009.\nTourism represents a major source of foreign currency for the city although by south-east Asian standards the number of foreign visitors to Yangon has always been quite low\u2014about 250,000 before the Saffron Revolution in September 2007. The number of visitors dipped even further following the Saffron Revolution and Cyclone Nargis. The recent improvement in the country's political climate has attracted an increasing number of businessmen and tourists. Between 300,000 and 400,000 visitors that went through Yangon International in 2011. However, after years of underinvestment, Yangon's modest hotel infrastructure\u2014only 3000 of the total 8000 hotel rooms in Yangon are \"suitable for tourists\"\u2014is already bursting at seams, and will need to be expanded to handle additional visitors. As part of an urban development strategy, a hotel zone has been planned in Yangon's outskirts, encompassing government- and military-owned land in Mingaladon, Hlegu and Htaukkyant Townships.\nEducation.\nYangon educational facilities has a very high number of qualified teachers but the state spending on education is among the lowest of the world. Around 2007 estimate by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies puts the spending for education at 0.5% of the national budget. The disparity in educational opportunities and achievement between rich and poor schools is quite stark even within the city. With little or no state support forthcoming, schools have to rely on forced \"donations\" and fees from parents for nearly everything \u2013 school maintenance to teachers' salaries, forcing many poor students to drop out.\nWhile many students in poor districts fail to reach high school, a handful of Yangon high schools in wealthier districts such as Dagon 1, Sanchaung 2, Kamayut 2, Bahan 2, Latha 2, and TTC provide the majority of students admitted to the most selective universities in the country, highlighting the extreme shallowness of talent pool in the country. The wealthy bypass the state education system altogether, sending their children to private English language instruction schools such as YIEC or more widely known as ISM, or abroad (typically Singapore or Australia) for university education. In 2014, international schools in Yangon cost at least US$8,000 a year.\nThere are over 20 universities and colleges in the city. While Yangon University remains the best known (its main campus is a part of popular Burmese culture e.g. literature, music, film, etc.), the nation's oldest university is now mostly a graduate school, deprived of undergraduate studies. Following the 1988 nationwide uprising, the military government has repeatedly closed universities, and has dispersed most of the undergraduate student population to new universities in the suburbs such as Dagon University, the University of East Yangon and the University of West Yangon. Nonetheless, many of the country's most selective universities are still in Yangon. Students from around the country still have to come to study in Yangon as some subjects are offered only at its universities. The University of Medicine 1, University of Medicine 2, Yangon Technological University, University of Computer Studies and Myanmar Maritime University are the most selective in the country.\nSchools for foreign expatriates include:\nHealth care.\nThe general state of health care in Yangon is poor. According to a 2007 estimate, the military government spends 0.4% of the national budget on health care, and 40% to 60% on defence. By the government's own figures, it spends 849 kyats (US$0.85) per person. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals including the flagship Yangon General Hospital lack many of the basic facilities and equipment.\nWealthier Yangonites still have access to country's best medical facilities and internationally qualified doctors. Only Yangon and Mandalay have any sizeable number of doctors left as many Burmese doctors have emigrated. The well-to-do go to private clinics or hospitals like Pun Hlaing International Hospital and Bahosi Medical Clinic. Medical malpractice is widespread, even in private clinics and hospitals that serve the well-to-do. In 2009 and 2010, a spate of high-profile deaths brought out the severity of the problem, even for the relatively well off Yangonites. The wealthy do not rely on domestic hospitals and travel abroad, usually Bangkok or Singapore, for treatment.\nThe following are healthcare facilities in Yangon in 2010\u20132011.\nInternational relations.\nYangon is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nYangon is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was derived from the Value-oriented Algorithmic Language (VAL), designed by Jack Dennis, and adds recursion and finite streams. It has a Pascal-like syntax and was designed to be a common high-level programming language for numerical programs on a variety of multiprocessors.\nHistory.\nSISAL was defined in 1983 by James McGraw et al., at the University of Manchester, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Colorado State University and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It was revised in 1985, and the first compiled implementation was made in 1986. Its performance is superior to C and rivals Fortran, according to some sources, combined with efficient and automatic parallelization.\nSISAL's name came from grepping \"sal\" for \"Single Assignment Language\" from the Unix dictionary /usr/dict/words.\nVersions exist for the Cray X-MP, Y-MP, 2; Sequent, Encore Alliant, DEC DEC VAX-11/784, dataflow architectures, KSR1, Inmos Transputers, and systolic arrays.\nArchitecture.\nThe requirements for a fine-grain parallelism language are better met with a dataflow programming language than a system programming language.\nSISAL is more than just a dataflow and fine-grain language. It is a set of tools that convert a textual human readable dataflow language into a graph format (named \"IF1\" - Intermediary Form 1). Part of the SISAL project also involved converting this graph format into runnable C code.\nSISAL Renaissance Era.\nIn 2010 SISAL saw a brief resurgence when a group of undergraduates at Worcester Polytechnic Institute investigated implementing a fine-grain parallelism backend for the SISAL language.\nIn 2018 SISAL was modernized with indent-based syntax, first-class functions, lambdas, closures and lazy semantics within a project SISAL-IS.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It yields a stiff fibre used in making rope and various other products. The sisal fiber is traditionally used for rope and twine, and has many other uses, including cloth, footwear, hats, bags, carpets, geotextiles, and dartboards. It is also used as fiber reinforcements for composite fiberglass, rubber, and concrete products. Like other agaves, the pith of the leaves can be fermented and distilled to make mezcal.\nSisal has an uncertain native origin, but is thought to have originated in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Sisal plants have a lifespan of 7\u201310 years, producing 200\u2013250 usable leaves containing fibers used in various applications. Sisal is a tropical and subtropical plant, thriving in temperatures above and sunshine.\nHistorically, sisal was used by the Aztecs and Maya for a crude fabric. It spread to other parts of the world in the 19th century, with Brazil becoming the major producer. Sisal is propagated using bulbils or suckers and can be improved genetically through tissue culture. Fibers are extracted through decortication and then dried, brushed, and baled for export.\nSisal farming initially led to environmental degradation, but it is now considered less damaging than other farming types. It is an invasive species in Hawaii and Florida.\nGlobal sisal production in 2020 was 210,000 tons, with Brazil being the largest producer, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar, China, and Mexico.\nTaxonomy.\nThe native origin of \"Agave sisalana\" is uncertain. Traditionally, it was deemed to be a native of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, but no records exist of botanical collections from there. They were originally shipped from the Spanish colonial port of Sisal in Yucat\u00e1n (thus the name). The Yucat\u00e1n plantations now cultivate henequen (\"Agave fourcroydes\").\nH. S. Gentry hypothesized a Chiapas origin, on the strength of traditional local usage. Evidence of an indigenous cottage industry there suggests it as the original habitat location, possibly as a cross of \"Agave angustifolia\" and \"Agave kewensis\". The species is now naturalized in other parts of Mexico, as well as in Spain, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Madagascar, R\u00e9union, Seychelles, many parts of Africa, China, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Burma, Cambodia, Thailand, the Solomon Islands, Queensland, Fiji, Hawaii, Florida, Central America, Ecuador, and the West Indies.\nPlant description.\nSisal plants consist of a rosette of sword-shaped leaves about tall. Young leaves may have a few minute teeth along their margins, but lose them as they mature.\nThe sisal plant has a 7- to 10-year lifespan and typically produces 200\u2013250 commercially usable leaves. Each leaf contains around 1000 fibers. The fibers account for only about 4% of the plant by weight. Sisal is considered a plant of the tropics and subtropics, since production benefits from temperatures above and sunshine.\nCultivation.\nSisal was used by the Aztecs and the Maya to make a fabric.\nIn the 19th century, sisal cultivation spread to Florida, the Caribbean islands, and Brazil (Paraiba and Bahia), as well as to countries in Africa, notably Tanzania and Kenya, and Asia. Sisal reportedly \"came to Africa from Florida, through the mechanism of a remarkable German botanist, by the name of Hindorf.\"\nIn Cuba its cultivation was introduced in 1880 by Fernando Heydrich in Matanzas.\nThe first commercial plantings in Brazil were made in the late 1930s, and the first sisal fiber exports from there were made in 1948. Brazilian production did not accelerate until the 1960s, and the first of many spinning mills was established. Today, Brazil is the major world producer of sisal.\nPropagation.\nPropagation of sisal is generally by using bulbils produced from buds in the flower stalk or by suckers growing around the base of the plant, which are grown in nursery fields until large enough to be transplanted to their final positions. These methods offer no potential for genetic improvement. \"In vitro\" multiplication of selected genetic material using meristematic tissue culture offers considerable potential for the development of improved genetic material.\nFiber extraction.\nFiber is extracted by a process known as decortication, where leaves are crushed, beaten, and brushed away by a rotating wheel set with blunt knives, so that only fibers remain. Alternatively, in East Africa, where production is typically on large estates, the leaves are transported to a central decortication plant, where water is used to wash away the waste parts of the leaves.\nThe fiber is then dried, brushed, and baled for export. Proper drying is important, as fiber quality depends largely on moisture content. Artificial drying has been found to result in generally better grades of fiber than sun drying, but is not always feasible in the less industrialized countries where sisal is produced. In the drier climate of northeast Brazil, sisal is mainly grown by smallholders and the fiber is extracted by teams using portable \"raspadors\", which do not use water.\nFiber is subsequently cleaned by brushing. Dry fibers are machine combed and sorted into various grades, largely on the basis of the previous in-field separation of leaves into size groups.\nEnvironmental impacts.\nSisal farming initially caused environmental degradation, because sisal plantations replaced native forests, but is still considered less damaging than many types of farming. No chemical fertilizers are used in sisal production, and although herbicides are occasionally used, even this impact may be eliminated, since most weeding is done by hand. The effluent from the decortication process causes serious pollution when it is allowed to flow into watercourses.\nSisal is considered to be an invasive species in Hawaii and Florida.\nUses.\nTraditionally, sisal has been the leading material for agricultural twine (binder twine and baler twine) because of its strength, durability, ability to stretch, affinity for certain dyestuffs, and resistance to deterioration in saltwater. The importance of this traditional use is diminishing with competition from polypropylene and the development of other haymaking techniques, while new higher-valued sisal products have been developed.\nApart from ropes, twines, and general cordage, sisal is used in low-cost and specialty paper, dartboards, buffing cloth, filters, geotextiles, mattresses, carpets, handicrafts, wire rope cores, and macram\u00e9. Sisal has been used as an environmentally friendly strengthening agent to replace asbestos and fiberglass in composite materials in various uses, including the automobile industry. The lower-grade fiber is processed by the paper industry because of its high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses. The medium-grade fiber is used in the cordage industry for making ropes and baler and binder twine. Ropes and twines are widely employed for marine, agricultural, and general industrial use. The higher-grade fiber after treatment is converted into yarns and used by the carpet industry.\nOther products developed from sisal fiber include spa products, cat-scratching posts, lumbar support belts, rugs, slippers, cloths, and disc buffers. Sisal wall covering meets the abrasion and tearing resistance standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials and of the National Fire Protection Association.\nSisal walls were used very frequently in the construction of Mormon meetinghouses built between 1985 and 2010. Because of its frequent use, it has become a meme in Mormon culture.\nAs extraction of fiber uses only a small percentage of the plant, some attempts to improve economic viability have focused on using the waste material for production of biogas, for stockfeed, or the extraction of pharmaceutical materials.\nSisal is a valuable forage for honeybees because of its long flowering period. It is particularly attractive to them during pollen shortage. The honey produced, however, is dark and has a strong and unpleasant flavor.\nBecause sisal is an agave, it can be fermented and distilled to make mezcal. In India, it may be an ingredient in some street snacks.\nCarpets.\nDespite the yarn durability for which sisal is known, slight matting of sisal carpeting may occur in high-traffic areas. Sisal carpet does not build up static nor does it trap dust, so vacuuming is the only maintenance required. High-spill areas should be treated with a fiber sealer and for spot removal, a dry-cleaning powder is recommended. Depending on climatic conditions, sisal absorbs air humidity or releases it, causing expansion or contraction. Sisal is not recommended for areas that receive wet spills or rain or snow. Sisal is used by itself in carpets or in blends with wool and acrylic for a softer hand.\nGlobal production and trade patterns.\nGlobal production of sisal fiber in 2020 amounted to 210 thousand metric tons, of which Brazil, the largest producing country, produced 86,061 tons.\nTanzania produced about 36,379 tons, Kenya produced 22,768 tons, Madagascar 17,578 tons, and 14,006 tons were produced in China. Mexico contributed 13,107 tons with smaller amounts coming from Haiti, Morocco, Venezuela, and South Africa. Sisal occupies sixth place among fiber plants, representing 2% of the world's production of plant fiber (plant fiber provide 65% of the world's fiber).\nHeraldry.\nThe sisal plant appears in the coat of arms of Barquisimeto, Venezuela.\nAn unofficial for the Mexican state of Yucat\u00e1n features a deer bounding over a sisal plant.\nIn literature.\nJournalist John Gunther wrote of sisal in 1953, \"if it had not been for the fact that sisal is a difficult crop, there might not have been a Munich in 1939. Neville Chamberlain started out life as a sisal planter in the Bahamas, and only returned to Britain and entered politics when he found that this obdurate vegetable was too hard to grow.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Depending on the size of the numbers, different algorithms are more efficient than others. Numerous algorithms are known and there has been much research into the topic.\nThe oldest and simplest method, known since antiquity as long multiplication or grade-school multiplication, consists of multiplying every digit in the first number by every digit in the second and adding the results. This has a time complexity of formula_1, where \"n\" is the number of digits. When done by hand, this may also be reframed as grid method multiplication or lattice multiplication. In software, this may be called \"shift and add\" due to bitshifts and addition being the only two operations needed.\nIn 1960, Anatoly Karatsuba discovered Karatsuba multiplication, unleashing a flood of research into fast multiplication algorithms. This method uses three multiplications rather than four to multiply two two-digit numbers. (A variant of this can also be used to multiply complex numbers quickly.) Done recursively, this has a time complexity of formula_2. Splitting numbers into more than two parts results in Toom\u2013Cook multiplication; for example, using three parts results in the Toom-3 algorithm. Using many parts can set the exponent arbitrarily close to 1, but the constant factor also grows, making it impractical.\nIn 1968, the Sch\u00f6nhage\u2013Strassen algorithm, which makes use of a Fourier transform over a modulus, was discovered. It has a time complexity of formula_3. In 2007, Martin F\u00fcrer proposed an algorithm with complexity formula_4. In 2014, Harvey, Joris van der Hoeven, and Lecerf proposed one with complexity formula_5, thus making the implicit constant explicit; this was improved to formula_6 in 2018. Lastly, in 2019, Harvey and van der Hoeven came up with a galactic algorithm with complexity formula_7. This matches a guess by Sch\u00f6nhage and Strassen that this would be the optimal bound, although this remains a conjecture today.\nInteger multiplication algorithms can also be used to multiply polynomials by means of the method of Kronecker substitution.\nLong multiplication.\nIf a positional numeral system is used, a natural way of multiplying numbers is taught in schools\nas long multiplication, sometimes called grade-school multiplication, sometimes called the Standard Algorithm:\nmultiply the multiplicand by each digit of the multiplier and then add up all the properly shifted results. It requires memorization of the multiplication table for single digits.\nThis is the usual algorithm for multiplying larger numbers by hand in base 10. A person doing long multiplication on paper will write down all the products and then add them together; an abacus-user will sum the products as soon as each one is computed.\nExample.\nThis example uses \"long multiplication\" to multiply 23,958,233 (multiplicand) by 5,830 (multiplier) and arrives at 139,676,498,390 for the result (product).\n 23958233\n \u00d7 5830\n 00000000 ( = 23,958,233 \u00d7 0)\n 71874699 ( = 23,958,233 \u00d7 30)\n 191665864 ( = 23,958,233 \u00d7 800)\n + 119791165 ( = 23,958,233 \u00d7 5,000)\n 139676498390 ( = 139,676,498,390)\nOther notations.\nIn some countries such as Germany, the above multiplication is depicted similarly but with the original product kept horizontal and computation starting with the first digit of the multiplier:\n 23958233 \u00b7 5830\n 119791165\n 191665864\n 71874699\n 00000000\n 139676498390\nBelow pseudocode describes the process of above multiplication. It keeps only one row to maintain the sum which finally becomes the result. Note that the '+=' operator is used to denote sum to existing value and store operation (akin to languages such as Java and C) for compactness.\nmultiply(a[1..p], b[1..q], base) // Operands containing rightmost digits at index 1\n product = [1..p+q] // Allocate space for result\n for b_i = 1 to q // for all digits in b\n carry = 0\n for a_i = 1 to p // for all digits in a\n product[a_i + b_i - 1] += carry + a[a_i] * b[b_i]\n carry = product[a_i + b_i - 1] / base\n product[a_i + b_i - 1] = product[a_i + b_i - 1] mod base\n product[b_i + p] = carry // last digit comes from final carry\n return product\nUsage in computers.\nSome chips implement long multiplication, in hardware or in microcode, for various integer and floating-point word sizes. In arbitrary-precision arithmetic, it is common to use long multiplication with the base set to 2\"w\", where \"w\" is the number of bits in a word, for multiplying relatively small numbers. To multiply two numbers with \"n\" digits using this method, one needs about \"n\"2 operations. More formally, multiplying two \"n\"-digit numbers using long multiplication requires \u0398(\"n\"2) single-digit operations (additions and multiplications).\nWhen implemented in software, long multiplication algorithms must deal with overflow during additions, which can be expensive. A typical solution is to represent the number in a small base, \"b\", such that, for example, 8\"b\" is a representable machine integer. Several additions can then be performed before an overflow occurs. When the number becomes too large, we add part of it to the result, or we carry and map the remaining part back to a number that is less than \"b\". This process is called \"normalization\". Richard Brent used this approach in his Fortran package, MP.\nComputers initially used a very similar algorithm to long multiplication in base 2, but modern processors have optimized circuitry for fast multiplications using more efficient algorithms, at the price of a more complex hardware realization. In base two, long multiplication is sometimes called \"shift and add\", because the algorithm simplifies and just consists of shifting left (multiplying by powers of two) and adding. Most currently available microprocessors implement this or other similar algorithms (such as Booth encoding) for various integer and floating-point sizes in hardware multipliers or in microcode.\nOn currently available processors, a bit-wise shift instruction is usually (but not always) faster than a multiply instruction and can be used to multiply (shift left) and divide (shift right) by powers of two. Multiplication by a constant and division by a constant can be implemented using a sequence of shifts and adds or subtracts. For example, there are several ways to multiply by 10 using only bit-shift and addition.\n ((x \u00ab 2) + x) \u00ab 1 # Here 10*x is computed as (x*2^2 + x)*2\n (x \u00ab 3) + (x \u00ab 1) # Here 10*x is computed as x*2^3 + x*2\nIn some cases such sequences of shifts and adds or subtracts will outperform hardware multipliers and especially dividers. A division by a number of the form formula_8 or formula_9 often can be converted to such a short sequence.\nAlgorithms for multiplying by hand.\nIn addition to the standard long multiplication, there are several other methods used to perform multiplication by hand. Such algorithms may be devised for speed, ease of calculation, or educational value, particularly when computers or multiplication tables are unavailable.\nGrid method.\nThe grid method (or box method) is an introductory method for multiple-digit multiplication that is often taught to pupils at primary school or elementary school. It has been a standard part of the national primary school mathematics curriculum in England and Wales since the late 1990s.\nBoth factors are broken up (\"partitioned\") into their hundreds, tens and units parts, and the products of the parts are then calculated explicitly in a relatively simple multiplication-only stage, before these contributions are then totalled to give the final answer in a separate addition stage.\nThe calculation 34 \u00d7 13, for example, could be computed using the grid:\nfollowed by addition to obtain 442, either in a single sum (see right), or through forming the row-by-row totals \n (300 + 40) + (90 + 12) = 340 + 102 = 442.\nThis calculation approach (though not necessarily with the explicit grid arrangement) is also known as the partial products algorithm. Its essence is the calculation of the simple multiplications separately, with all addition being left to the final gathering-up stage.\nThe grid method can in principle be applied to factors of any size, although the number of sub-products becomes cumbersome as the number of digits increases. Nevertheless, it is seen as a usefully explicit method to introduce the idea of multiple-digit multiplications; and, in an age when most multiplication calculations are done using a calculator or a spreadsheet, it may in practice be the only multiplication algorithm that some students will ever need.\nLattice multiplication.\nLattice, or sieve, multiplication is algorithmically equivalent to long multiplication. It requires the preparation of a lattice (a grid drawn on paper) which guides the calculation and separates all the multiplications from the additions. It was introduced to Europe in 1202 in Fibonacci's Liber Abaci. Fibonacci described the operation as mental, using his right and left hands to carry the intermediate calculations. Matrak\u00e7\u0131 Nasuh presented 6 different variants of this method in this 16th-century book, Umdet-ul Hisab. It was widely used in Enderun schools across the Ottoman Empire. Napier's bones, or Napier's rods also used this method, as published by Napier in 1617, the year of his death.\nAs shown in the example, the multiplicand and multiplier are written above and to the right of a lattice, or a sieve. It is found in Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi's \"Arithmetic\", one of Leonardo's sources mentioned by Sigler, author of \"Fibonacci's Liber Abaci\", 2002.\nExample.\nThe pictures on the right show how to calculate 345 \u00d7 12 using lattice multiplication. As a more complicated example, consider the picture below displaying the computation of 23,958,233 multiplied by 5,830 (multiplier); the result is 139,676,498,390. Notice 23,958,233 is along the top of the lattice and 5,830 is along the right side. The products fill the lattice and the sum of those products (on the diagonal) are along the left and bottom sides. Then those sums are totaled as shown.\nRussian peasant multiplication.\nThe binary method is also known as peasant multiplication, because it has been widely used by people who are classified as peasants and thus have not memorized the multiplication tables required for long multiplication. The algorithm was in use in ancient Egypt. Its main advantages are that it can be taught quickly, requires no memorization, and can be performed using tokens, such as poker chips, if paper and pencil aren't available. The disadvantage is that it takes more steps than long multiplication, so it can be unwieldy for large numbers.\nDescription.\nOn paper, write down in one column the numbers you get when you repeatedly halve the multiplier, ignoring the remainder; in a column beside it repeatedly double the multiplicand.

Looking both those values up on the table yields 36 and 9, the difference of which is 27, which is the product of 9 and 3.\nHistory of quarter square multiplication.\nIn prehistoric time, quarter square multiplication involved floor function; that some sources attribute to Babylonian mathematics (2000\u20131600 BC).\nAntoine Voisin published a table of quarter squares from 1 to 1000 in 1817 as an aid in multiplication. A larger table of quarter squares from 1 to 100000 was published by Samuel Laundy in 1856, and a table from 1 to 200000 by Joseph Blater in 1888.\nQuarter square multipliers were used in analog computers to form an analog signal that was the product of two analog input signals. In this application, the sum and difference of two input voltages are formed using operational amplifiers. The square of each of these is approximated using piecewise linear circuits. Finally the difference of the two squares is formed and scaled by a factor of one fourth using yet another operational amplifier.\nIn 1980, Everett L. Johnson proposed using the quarter square method in a digital multiplier. To form the product of two 8-bit integers, for example, the digital device forms the sum and difference, looks both quantities up in a table of squares, takes the difference of the results, and divides by four by shifting two bits to the right. For 8-bit integers the table of quarter squares will have 29\u22121=511 entries (one entry for the full range 0..510 of possible sums, the differences using only the first 256 entries in range 0..255) or 29\u22121=511 entries (using for negative differences the technique of 2-complements and 9-bit masking, which avoids testing the sign of differences), each entry being 16-bit wide (the entry values are from (0\u00b2/4)=0 to (510\u00b2/4)=65025).\nThe quarter square multiplier technique has benefited 8-bit systems that do not have any support for a hardware multiplier. Charles Putney implemented this for the 6502.\nComputational complexity of multiplication.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in computer science\nWhat is the fastest algorithm for multiplication of two formula_18-digit numbers?\nMore unsolved problems in computer science\nA line of research in theoretical computer science is about the number of single-bit arithmetic operations necessary to multiply two formula_18-bit integers. This is known as the computational complexity of multiplication. Usual algorithms done by hand have asymptotic complexity of formula_1, but in 1960 Anatoly Karatsuba discovered that better complexity was possible (with the Karatsuba algorithm).\nCurrently, the algorithm with the best computational complexity is a 2019 algorithm of David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven, which uses the strategies of using number-theoretic transforms introduced with the Sch\u00f6nhage\u2013Strassen algorithm to multiply integers using only formula_7 operations. This is conjectured to be the best possible algorithm, but lower bounds of formula_22 are not known.\nKaratsuba multiplication.\nKaratsuba multiplication is an O(\"n\"log23) \u2248 O(\"n\"1.585) divide and conquer algorithm, that uses recursion to merge subcalculations.\nBy rewriting the formula, one makes it possible to do sub calculations / recursion. By doing recursion, one can solve this in a fast manner.\nLet formula_12 and formula_13 be represented as formula_18-digit strings in some base formula_26. For any positive integer formula_27 less than formula_18, one can write the two given numbers as\nformula_29\nformula_30\nwhere formula_31 and formula_32 are less than formula_33. The product is then\nformula_34\nwhere\nformula_35\nformula_36\nformula_37\nThese formulae require four multiplications and were known to Charles Babbage. Karatsuba observed that formula_38 can be computed in only three multiplications, at the cost of a few extra additions. With formula_39 and formula_40 as before one can observe that\nformula_41\nBecause of the overhead of recursion, Karatsuba's multiplication is slower than long multiplication for small values of \"n\"; typical implementations therefore switch to long multiplication for small values of \"n\".\nGeneral case with multiplication of N numbers.\nBy exploring patterns after expansion, one see following:\nformula_42\nEach summand is associated to a unique binary number from 0 to\nformula_43, for example formula_44 etc. Furthermore; B is powered to number of 1, in this binary string, multiplied with m.\nIf we express this in fewer terms, we get:\nformula_45, where formula_46 means digit in number i at position j. Notice that formula_47\nformula_48\nHistory.\nKaratsuba's algorithm was the first known algorithm for multiplication that is asymptotically faster than long multiplication, and can thus be viewed as the starting point for the theory of fast multiplications.\nToom\u2013Cook.\nAnother method of multiplication is called Toom\u2013Cook or Toom-3. The Toom\u2013Cook method splits each number to be multiplied into multiple parts. The Toom\u2013Cook method is one of the generalizations of the Karatsuba method. A three-way Toom\u2013Cook can do a size-\"3N\" multiplication for the cost of five size-\"N\" multiplications. This accelerates the operation by a factor of 9/5, while the Karatsuba method accelerates it by 4/3.\nAlthough using more and more parts can reduce the time spent on recursive multiplications further, the overhead from additions and digit management also grows. For this reason, the method of Fourier transforms is typically faster for numbers with several thousand digits, and asymptotically faster for even larger numbers.\nSch\u00f6nhage\u2013Strassen.\nEvery number in base B, can be written as a polynomial:\nformula_49\nFurthermore, multiplication of two numbers could be thought of as a product of two polynomials:\nformula_50\nSince the coefficient of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; in the product is formula_51\none has a convolution, and one can use the fast Fourier transform (FFT):\nformula_52 \nTherefore, the multiplication is reduced to a FFT, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; multiplications, and an inverse FFT. It results a time complexity of \"O\"(\"n\"\u00a0log(\"n\")\u00a0log(log \"n\")).\nHistory.\nThe algorithm was invented by Strassen (1968). It was made practical and theoretical guarantees were provided in 1971 by Sch\u00f6nhage and Strassen resulting in the Sch\u00f6nhage\u2013Strassen algorithm.\nFurther improvements.\nIn 2007 the asymptotic complexity of integer multiplication was improved by the Swiss mathematician Martin F\u00fcrer of Pennsylvania State University to formula_53 using Fourier transforms over complex numbers, where log* denotes the iterated logarithm. Anindya De, Chandan Saha, Piyush Kurur and Ramprasad Saptharishi gave a similar algorithm using modular arithmetic in 2008 achieving the same running time. In context of the above material, what these latter authors have achieved is to find \"N\" much less than 23\"k\" + 1, so that \"Z\"/\"NZ\" has a (2\"m\")th root of unity. This speeds up computation and reduces the time complexity. However, these latter algorithms are only faster than Sch\u00f6nhage\u2013Strassen for impractically large inputs.\nIn 2014, Harvey, Joris van der Hoeven and Lecerf gave a new algorithm that achieves a running time of formula_54, making explicit the implied constant in the formula_55 exponent. They also proposed a variant of their algorithm which achieves formula_56 but whose validity relies on standard conjectures about the distribution of Mersenne primes. In 2016, Covanov and Thom\u00e9 proposed an integer multiplication algorithm based on a generalization of Fermat primes that conjecturally achieves a complexity bound of formula_56. This matches the 2015 conditional result of Harvey, van der Hoeven, and Lecerf but uses a different algorithm and relies on a different conjecture. In 2018, Harvey and van der Hoeven used an approach based on the existence of short lattice vectors guaranteed by Minkowski's theorem to prove an unconditional complexity bound of formula_56.\nIn March 2019, David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven announced their discovery of an \"O\"(\"n\" log \"n\") multiplication algorithm. It was published in the \"Annals of Mathematics\" in 2021. Because Sch\u00f6nhage and Strassen predicted that \"n\"\u00a0log(\"n\") is the \"best possible\" result, Harvey said: \"...our work is expected to be the end of the road for this problem, although we don't know yet how to prove this rigorously.\"\nLower bounds.\nThere is a trivial lower bound of \u03a9(\"n\") for multiplying two \"n\"-bit numbers on a single processor; no matching algorithm (on conventional machines, that is on Turing equivalent machines) nor any sharper lower bound is known. The Hartmanis\u2013Stearns conjecture would imply that formula_59 cannot be achieved. Multiplication lies outside of AC0[\"p\"] for any prime \"p\", meaning there is no family of constant-depth, polynomial (or even subexponential) size circuits using AND, OR, NOT, and MOD\"p\" gates that can compute a product. This follows from a constant-depth reduction of MOD\"q\" to multiplication. Lower bounds for multiplication are also known for some classes of branching programs.\nComplex number multiplication.\nComplex multiplication normally involves four multiplications and two additions.\nformula_60\nOr\nformula_61\nAs observed by Peter Ungar in 1963, one can reduce the number of multiplications to three, using essentially the same computation as Karatsuba's algorithm. The product (\"a\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"bi\") \u00b7 (\"c\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"di\") can be calculated in the following way.\n\"k\"1 = \"c\" \u00b7 (\"a\" + \"b\")\n\"k\"2 = \"a\" \u00b7 (\"d\" \u2212 \"c\")\n\"k\"3 = \"b\" \u00b7 (\"c\" + \"d\")\nReal part = \"k\"1 \u2212 \"k\"3\nImaginary part = \"k\"1 + \"k\"2.\nThis algorithm uses only three multiplications, rather than four, and five additions or subtractions rather than two. If a multiply is more expensive than three adds or subtracts, as when calculating by hand, then there is a gain in speed. On modern computers a multiply and an add can take about the same time so there may be no speed gain. There is a trade-off in that there may be some loss of precision when using floating point.\nFor fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) (or any linear transformation) the complex multiplies are by constant coefficients \"c\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"di\" (called twiddle factors in FFTs), in which case two of the additions (\"d\"\u2212\"c\" and \"c\"+\"d\") can be precomputed. Hence, only three multiplies and three adds are required. However, trading off a multiplication for an addition in this way may no longer be beneficial with modern floating-point units.\nPolynomial multiplication.\nAll the above multiplication algorithms can also be expanded to multiply polynomials. Alternatively the Kronecker substitution technique may be used to convert the problem of multiplying polynomials into a single binary multiplication.\nLong multiplication methods can be generalised to allow the multiplication of algebraic formulae:\n 14ac - 3ab + 2 multiplied by ac - ab + 1\n 14ac -3ab 2\n ac -ab 1\n 14a2c2 -3a2bc 2ac\n -14a2bc 3 a2b2 -2ab\n 14ac -3ab 2\n 14a2c2 -17a2bc 16ac 3a2b2 -5ab +2\nAs a further example of column based multiplication, consider multiplying 23 long tons (t), 12 hundredweight (cwt) and 2 quarters (qtr) by 47. This example uses avoirdupois measures: 1 t = 20 cwt, 1 cwt = 4 qtr.\n t cwt qtr\n 23 12 2\n 47 \u00d7\n 1. Multiply everything by 47\n 1081 564 94\n 2a.

Final add\n 1110 7 2\n ================= Answer: 1110 ton 7 cwt 2 qtr\nThe same layout and methods can be used for any traditional measurements and non-decimal currencies such as the old British \u00a3sd system.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name also refers to the edible fruit produced by this tree. The rambutan is native to Southeast Asia. It is closely related to several other edible tropical fruits, including the lychee, longan, pulasan, and quenepa.\nDescription.\nIt is an evergreen tree growing to a height of . The leaves are alternate, long, pinnate, with three to eleven leaflets, each leaflet wide and broad with an entire margin.\nThe flowers are small, , apetalous, discoidal, and borne in erect terminal panicles wide. Rambutan trees can be male (producing only staminate flowers and, hence, produce no fruit), female (producing flowers that are only functionally female), or hermaphroditic (producing flowers that are female with a small percentage of male flowers).\nFruit.\nThe fruit is a round to oval single-seeded drupe, long, rarely to long and broad, borne in a loose pendant cluster of ten to twenty fruits together. The leathery skin is reddish (rarely orange or yellow) and covered with fleshy pliable spines, hence the name, which means 'hairs'. The spines (also known as \"spinterns\") contribute to the transpiration of the fruit, which can affect the fruit's quality.\nThe fruit flesh, the aril, is translucent, whitish, or very pale pink, with a sweet, mildly acidic flavor reminiscent of grapes.\nThe single seed is glossy brown, , with a white basal scar. Soft and containing equal portions of saturated and unsaturated fats, the seed may be cooked and eaten, but is bitter and has narcotic properties.\nHistory.\nAround the 13th to 15th centuries, Arab traders, who played a major role in Indian Ocean trade, introduced rambutans to Zanzibar and Pemba in East Africa. There are limited rambutan plantings in some parts of India. In the 19th century, the Dutch introduced rambutans from Indonesia in Southeast Asia, to Suriname in South America. Subsequently, the plants spread to the tropical Americas, planted in the coastal lowlands of Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Trinidad, and Cuba. In 1912, rambutans were introduced to the Philippines from Indonesia. Further introductions were made in 1920 (from Indonesia) and 1930 (from Malaya), but until the 1950s its distribution was limited.\nThere was an attempt to introduce rambutans to the Southeastern United States, with seeds imported from Java, Indonesia in 1906, but the species proved to be unsuccessful, except in Puerto Rico.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"rambutan\" is derived from the Malay word meaning 'hair' referring to the numerous hairy protuberances of the fruits, together with the noun-building suffix . Similarly, in Vietnam, they are called (meaning 'messy hair'). The Chinese name is (Mandarin \"h\u00f3ngm\u00e1od\u0101n\", Hokkien \"\u00e2ng-m\u00f4\u0358-tan\"), literally 'red-haired pellet'.\nComposition.\nNutrients.\nRambutan fruit is 78% water, 21% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat (see table; data are for canned fruit in syrup; raw fruit data are unpublished). In a reference amount of , the canned fruit supplies 82 calories and only manganese at 15% of the Daily Value (DV), while other micronutrients are in low content (less than 10% DV, table).\nPhytochemicals.\nAs an un-pigmented fruit flesh, rambutan does not contain significant polyphenol content, but its colorful rind displays diverse phenolic acids, such as syringic, coumaric, gallic, caffeic, and ellagic acids. Rambutan seeds contain equal proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, where arachidic (34%) and oleic (42%) acids, respectively, are the highest in fat content.\nThe pleasant fragrance of rambutan fruit derives from numerous volatile organic compounds, including beta-damascenone, vanillin, phenylacetic acid, and cinnamic acid.\nEcology.\nPollination.\nAromatic rambutan flowers are highly attractive to many insects, especially bees. Flies (Diptera), bees (Hymenoptera), and ants (\"Solenopsis\") are the main pollinators. Among the Diptera, \"Lucilia\" spp. are abundant, and among the Hymenoptera, honey bees (\"Apis dorsata\" and \"A. cerana\") and the stingless bee genus \"Trigona\" are the major visitors. \"A. cerana\" colonies foraging on rambutan flowers produce large quantities of honey. Bees foraging for nectar routinely contact the stigma of female flowers and gather significant quantities of the sticky pollen from male blossoms. Little pollen has been seen on bees foraging female flowers. Although male flowers open at 06:00, foraging by \"A. cerana\" is most intense between 07:00 and 11:00, tapering off rather abruptly thereafter. In Thailand, \"A. cerana\" is the preferred species for small-scale pollination of rambutan. Its hair is also helpful in pollination where pollen can be hooked on and transported to female flowers.\nVarieties.\nWell over 200 cultivars were developed from selected clones available throughout tropical Asia. Most of the cultivars are also selected for compact growth, reaching a height of only for easier harvesting.\nCompared to propagated rambutan clones, rambutans taken from the wild have a higher acidity and potential for various food purposes. In Indonesia, 22 rambutan cultivars were identified as good quality, with five as leading commercial cultivars: 'Binjai', 'Lebak Bulus', 'Rapiah', 'Cimacan' and 'Sinyonya', with other popular cultivars including 'Simacan', 'Silengkeng', 'Sikonto' and 'Aceh kuning'. In the Malay Peninsula, commercial varieties include 'Chooi Ang', 'Peng Thing Bee', 'Ya Tow', 'Azimat', and 'Ayer Mas'.\nIn Nicaragua, a joint World Relief\u2013European Union team distributed seedlings to organizations such as Ascociaci\u00f3n Pueblos en Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria in 2001 to more than 100 farmers. Some of these farmers saw the first production of rambutans from their trees in 2005\u20132006 with development directed at the local market.\nIn the Philippines, two cultivars of rambutans are distinguished by their seed. The common rambutan seed and fruit are difficult to separate, while the 'Maharlika Rambutan' fruit separates cleanly from its seed. The fruit taste and size of these two cultivars are identical, but the 'Maharlika Rambutan' is more popular with a higher price.\nUses.\nCulinary.\nThe fruit of the rambutan tree may be eaten raw by removing the peel, eating the pulp, and discarding the seed. Rambutan is most often used in desserts, such as sorbets and puddings, but also in curries and savory dishes. The flavor is similar to lychee and pairs well with other tropical fruits.\nCultivation.\nRambutans are adapted to warm tropical climates, around , and are sensitive to temperatures below . It is grown commercially within 12\u201315\u00b0 of the equator. The trees grow well at elevations up to above sea level and do best in deep soil, clay loam, or sandy loam rich in organic matter. They grow on hilly terrain where there is good drainage.\nRambutans are propagated by grafting, air-layering, and budding. Budded trees may fruit after two to three years with optimum production occurring after eight to ten years. Trees grown from seed bear after five to six years.\nThe aril is attached to the seed in some commercial cultivars, but \"freestone\" cultivars are available and in high demand. Usually, a single light brown seed is found, which is high in certain fats and oils (primarily oleic acid and arachidic acid) valuable to industry, and used in cooking and the manufacture of soap. Rambutan roots, bark, and leaves have various uses in traditional medicine and in the production of dyes.\nRambutan cut open\nIn some areas, rambutan trees can bear fruit twice annually, once in late fall and early winter, with a shorter season in late spring and early summer. Other areas, such as Costa Rica, have a single fruit season, with the start of the rainy season in April stimulating flowering, and the fruit is usually ripe in August and September. The fragile fruit must ripen on the tree, then they are harvested over a four- to seven-week period. The fresh fruit are easily bruised and have a limited shelf life. An average tree may produce 5,000\u20136,000 or more fruit ( per tree). Yields begin at in young orchards and may reach on mature trees. In Hawaii, of were harvested producing of fruit in 1997. Yields could be increased by improved orchard management, including pollination, and by planting high-yielding compact cultivars.\nMost commercial cultivars are hermaphroditic; cultivars that produce only functionally female flowers require the presence of male trees. Male trees are seldom found, as vegetative selection has favored hermaphroditic clones that produce a high proportion of functionally female flowers and a much lower number of flowers that produce pollen. Over 3,000 greenish-white flowers occur in male panicles, each with five to seven anthers and a nonfunctional ovary. Male flowers have yellow nectaries and five to seven stamens. About 500 greenish-yellow flowers occur in each hermaphroditic panicle. Each flower has six anthers, usually a bilobed stigma, and one ovule in each of its two sections (locules). The flowers are receptive for about one day but may persist if pollinators are excluded.\nIn Thailand, rambutan trees were first planted in Surat Thani in 1926 by the Chinese Malay K. Vong in Ban Na San. An annual rambutan fair is held during August harvest time.\nIn Malaysia, rambutan flowers from March to July and again between June and November, usually in response to rain following a dry period. Flowering periods differ for other localities. Most, but not all, flowers open early in the day. Up to 100 flowers in each female panicle may be open each day during peak bloom. The initial fruit set may approach 25 percent, but a high abortion level contributes to a much lower level of production at harvest (1 to 3 percent). The fruit matures 15 to 18 weeks after flowering.\nRambutan cultivation in Sri Lanka mainly consists of small home gardens. Malwana, a village in the Kelani River Valley, is popular for its rambutan orchards. Their production comes to market in May, June, and July when it is very common to observe seasonal traders along the streets of Colombo. Sri Lanka also has some off-season rambutan production in January and February in areas such as Bibile, Medagama, and Monaragala.\nBoth male and female flowers are faintly sweet-scented and have functional nectaries at the ovary base. Female flowers produce two to three times more nectar than male flowers. Nectar sugar concentration ranges between 18\u201347 percent and is similar between the flower types. Rambutans are an important nectar source for bees in Malaysia.\nCross-pollination is a necessity because the anther is absent in most functionally female flowers. Although apomixis may occur in some cultivars, rambutans, like lychee, are dependent upon insects for pollination. In Malaysia, where only about one percent of the female flowers set fruit, no fruit is set on bagged flowers while hand pollination resulted in a 13 percent fruit set. Pollinators may maintain fidelity to either male or hermaphroditic flowers (trees), thus limiting pollination and fruit set under natural conditions where crossing between male and female flowers is required.\nProduction.\nRambutan is a fruit tree cultivated in humid tropical Southeast Asia. It is a common garden fruit tree and propagated commercially in small orchards. It is one of the best-known fruits of Southeast Asia and is also widely cultivated elsewhere in the tropics including Africa, southern Mexico, the Caribbean islands, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Panama, India, Vietnam, Philippines, and Sri Lanka. It is also produced in Ecuador where it is known as \"achotillo,\" and on the island of Puerto Rico.\n, Thailand was the largest producer of rambutans (, RTGS:\u00a0), growing 450,000 tonnes, followed by Indonesia at 100,000 tonnes, and Malaysia, 60,000 tonnes. In Thailand, the major cultivation centers are Chanthaburi Province, followed by Chumphon Province and Surat Thani Province. In Indonesia, the production center of rambutan is in the western parts of Indonesia, which includes Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan. In Java, the orchards and \"pekarangan\" (habitation yards) in the villages of Greater Jakarta and West Java have been known as rambutan production centers since the colonial era, with a trading center in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta.\nDuring 2017 and years before, imports of rambutan to the European Union were about 1,000 tonnes annually, enabling a year-round supply from numerous tropical suppliers.\nThe fruits are usually sold fresh and have a short shelf-life, and are commonly used in making jams and jellies, or canned. Evergreen rambutan trees with their abundant colored fruit make attractive landscape specimens.\nIn India, rambutan is imported from Thailand, as well as grown in the Pathanamthitta District of the southern state of Kerala.\nRambutans are not climacteric fruit\u2014that is, they ripen only on the tree and appear not to produce a ripening agent, such as the plant hormone ethylene, after being harvested. However, at post-harvest, the quality of the fruit is affected by storage factors. Low humidity levels, storage time, and incidences of mechanical damage can severely affect the quality of the fruit which would negatively affect the demand for such. In general, the fruit has a short shelf life in ambient conditions but implementing methods that can extend such is a productional advantage. Certain treatments like irradiation and the use of hot-forced air can help in fruit preservation although the former has seen more success.\nDistribution.\nThe center of genetic diversity for rambutans is the Indonesian region. They have been widely cultivated in Southeast Asian areas, such as Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines. It has spread from there to parts of Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Central America.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was that of homeotic genes that regulate development in a wide range of eukaryotes.\nThe field is composed of multiple core evolutionary concepts. One is deep homology, the finding that dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as \"pax-6\", from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved even across phyla; they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times in different parts of the embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.\nNew morphological features and ultimately new species are produced by variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions. Another possibility is the neo-Lamarckian theory that epigenetic changes are later consolidated at gene level, something that may have been important early in the history of multicellular life.\nHistory.\nEarly theories.\nPhilosophers began to think about how animals acquired form in the womb in classical antiquity. Aristotle asserts in his \"Physics\" treatise that according to Empedocles, order \"spontaneously\" appears in the developing embryo. In his \"The Parts of Animals\" treatise, he argues that Empedocles' theory was wrong. In Aristotle's account, Empedocles stated that the vertebral column is divided into vertebrae because, as it happens, the embryo twists about and snaps the column into pieces. Aristotle argues instead that the process has a predefined goal: that the \"seed\" that develops into the embryo began with an inbuilt \"potential\" to become specific body parts, such as vertebrae. Further, each sort of animal gives rise to animals of its own kind: humans only have human babies.\nRecapitulation.\nA recapitulation theory of evolutionary development was proposed by \u00c9tienne Serres in 1824\u201326, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They argued that the embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first like that of a fish, then in turn like that of a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognized four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.\nEvolutionary morphology.\nFrom the early 19th century through most of the 20th century, embryology faced a mystery. Animals were seen to develop into adults of widely differing body plan, often through similar stages, from the egg, but zoologists knew almost nothing about how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level, and therefore equally little about how developmental processes had evolved. Charles Darwin argued that a shared embryonic structure implied a common ancestor. For example, Darwin cited in his 1859 book \"On the Origin of Species\" the shrimp-like larva of the barnacle, whose sessile adults looked nothing like other arthropods; Linnaeus and Cuvier had classified them as molluscs. Darwin also noted Alexander Kowalevsky's finding that the tunicate, too, was not a mollusc, but in its larval stage had a notochord and pharyngeal slits which developed from the same germ layers as the equivalent structures in vertebrates, and should therefore be grouped with them as chordates.\n19th century zoology thus converted embryology into an evolutionary science, connecting phylogeny with homologies between the germ layers of embryos. Zoologists including Fritz M\u00fcller proposed the use of embryology to discover phylogenetic relationships between taxa. M\u00fcller demonstrated that crustaceans shared the Nauplius larva, identifying several parasitic species that had not been recognized as crustaceans. M\u00fcller also recognized that natural selection must act on larvae, just as it does on adults, giving the lie to recapitulation, which would require larval forms to be shielded from natural selection. Two of Haeckel's other ideas about the evolution of development have fared better than recapitulation: he argued in the 1870s that changes in the timing (heterochrony) and changes in the positioning within the body (heterotopy) of aspects of embryonic development would drive evolution by changing the shape of a descendant's body compared to an ancestor's. It took a century before these ideas were shown to be correct.\nIn 1917, D'Arcy Thompson wrote a book on the shapes of animals, showing with simple mathematics how small changes to parameters, such as the angles of a gastropod's spiral shell, can radically alter an animal's form, though he preferred a mechanical to evolutionary explanation. But without molecular evidence, progress stalled.\nIn 1952, Alan Turing published his paper \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\", on the development of patterns in animals' bodies. He suggested that morphogenesis could be explained by a reaction\u2013diffusion system, a system of reacting chemicals able to diffuse through the body. He modelled catalysed chemical reactions using partial differential equations, showing that patterns emerged when the chemical reaction produced both a catalyst (A) and an inhibitor (B) that slowed down production of A. If A and B then diffused at different rates, A dominated in some places, and B in others. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had run experiments with similar results, but was unable to publish them because scientists thought at that time that creating visible order violated the second law of thermodynamics.\nThe modern synthesis of the early 20th century.\nIn the so-called modern synthesis of the early 20th century, between 1918 and 1930 Ronald Fisher brought together Darwin's theory of evolution, with its insistence on natural selection, heredity, and variation, and Gregor Mendel's laws of genetics into a coherent structure for evolutionary biology. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: but it did not explain embryology. Sean B. Carroll has commented that had evo-devo's insights been available, embryology would certainly have played a central role in the synthesis.\nThe evolutionary embryologist Gavin de Beer anticipated evolutionary developmental biology in his 1930 book \"Embryos and Ancestors\", by showing that evolution could occur by heterochrony, such as in the retention of juvenile features in the adult. This, de Beer argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in the fossil record, since embryos fossilise poorly. As the gaps in the fossil record had been used as an argument against Darwin's gradualist evolution, de Beer's explanation supported the Darwinian position. However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved.\nThe lac operon.\nIn 1961, Jacques Monod, Jean-Pierre Changeux and Fran\u00e7ois Jacob discovered the lac operon in the bacterium \"Escherichia coli\". It was a cluster of genes, arranged in a feedback control loop so that its products would only be made when \"switched on\" by an environmental stimulus. One of these products was an enzyme that splits a sugar, lactose; and lactose itself was the stimulus that switched the genes on. This was a revelation, as it showed for the first time that genes, even in organisms as small as a bacterium, are subject to precise control. The implication was that many other genes were also elaborately regulated.\nThe birth of evo-devo and a second synthesis.\nIn 1977, a revolution in thinking about evolution and developmental biology began, with the arrival of recombinant DNA technology in genetics, the book \"Ontogeny and Phylogeny\" by Stephen J. Gould and the paper \"Evolution and Tinkering\" by Fran\u00e7ois Jacob. Gould laid to rest Haeckel's interpretation of evolutionary embryology, while Jacob set out an alternative theory. \nThis led to a second synthesis, at last including embryology as well as molecular genetics, phylogeny, and evolutionary biology to form evo-devo. In 1978, Edward B. Lewis discovered homeotic genes that regulate embryonic development in \"Drosophila\" fruit flies, which like all insects are arthropods, one of the major phyla of invertebrate animals. \nBill McGinnis quickly discovered homeotic gene sequences, homeoboxes, in animals in other phyla, in vertebrates such as frogs, birds, and mammals; they were later also found in fungi such as yeasts, and in plants. There were evidently strong similarities in the genes that controlled development across all the eukaryotes.\nIn 1980, Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus described gap genes which help to create the segmentation pattern in fruit fly embryos; they and Lewis won a Nobel Prize for their work in 1995.\nLater, more specific similarities were discovered: for example, the distal-less gene was found in 1989 to be involved in the development of appendages or limbs in fruit flies, the fins of fish, the wings of chickens, the parapodia of marine annelid worms, the ampullae and siphons of tunicates, and the tube feet of sea urchins. It was evident that the gene must be ancient, dating back to the last common ancestor of bilateral animals (before the Ediacaran Period, which began some 635 million years ago). Evo-devo had started to uncover the ways that all animal bodies were built during development.\nThe control of body structure.\nDeep homology.\nRoughly spherical eggs of different animals give rise to distinct morphologies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for body-building proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe does not have a gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development of different features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.\nThe puzzle of how embryonic development was controlled began to be solved using the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\" as a model organism. The step-by-step control of its embryogenesis was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green fluorescent protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.\nUsing such a technique, in 1994 Walter Gehring found that the \"pax-6\" gene, vital for forming the eyes of fruit flies, exactly matches an eye-forming gene in mice and humans. The same gene was quickly found in many other groups of animals, such as squid, a cephalopod mollusc. Biologists including Ernst Mayr had believed that eyes had arisen in the animal kingdom at least 40 times, as the anatomy of different types of eye varies widely. For example, the fruit fly's compound eye is made of hundreds of small lensed structures (ommatidia); the human eye has a blind spot where the optic nerve enters the eye, and the nerve fibres run over the surface of the retina, so light has to pass through a layer of nerve fibres before reaching the detector cells in the retina, so the structure is effectively \"upside-down\"; in contrast, the cephalopod eye has the retina, then a layer of nerve fibres, then the wall of the eye \"the right way around\". The evidence of \"pax-6\", however, was that the same genes controlled the development of the eyes of all these animals, suggesting that they all evolved from a common ancestor. Ancient genes had been conserved through millions of years of evolution to create dissimilar structures for similar functions, demonstrating deep homology between structures once thought to be purely analogous. This notion was later extended to the evolution of embryogenesis and has caused a radical revision of the meaning of homology in evolutionary biology.\nGene toolkit.\nA small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the \"Hox\" genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.\nHox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva. \"Pax-6\", already mentioned, is a classic toolkit gene. Although other toolkit genes are involved in establishing the plant bodyplan, homeobox genes are also found in plants, implying they are common to all eukaryotes.\nThe embryo's regulatory networks.\nThe protein products of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of pleiotropy, i.e., being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular cis-regulatory elements. For example, while a non-pleiotropic rhodopsin gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element just a few hundred base pairs long, the pleiotropic eyeless cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs. The regulatory networks involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls \"scores to hundreds\" of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each. All this complexity enables genes involved in the development of the embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.\nSuch a cascading regulatory network has been studied in detail in the development of the fruit fly embryo. The young embryo is oval in shape, like a rugby ball. A small number of genes produce messenger RNAs that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the embryo. In the early embryo, the \"bicoid\" and \"hunchback\" genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give pattern to the future head and thorax; the \"caudal\" and \"nanos\" genes are at high concentration near the posterior end, and give pattern to the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of \"caudal\"'s messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later switches on genes which create the fly's hindmost segments, but only at the posterior end where it is most concentrated.\nThe Bicoid, Hunchback and Caudal proteins in turn regulate the transcription of gap genes such as \"giant\", \"knirps\", \"Kr\u00fcppel\", and \"tailless\" in a striped pattern, creating the first level of structures that will become segments. The proteins from these in turn control the pair-rule genes, which in the next stage set up 7 bands across the embryo's long axis. Finally, the segment polarity genes such as \"engrailed\" split each of the 7 bands into two, creating 14 future segments.\nThis process explains the accurate conservation of toolkit gene sequences, which has resulted in deep homology and functional equivalence of toolkit proteins in dissimilar animals (seen, for example, when a mouse protein controls fruit fly development). The interactions of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements, or of signalling proteins and receptors, become locked in through multiple usages, making almost any mutation deleterious and hence eliminated by natural selection.\nThe mechanism that sets up every animal's front-back axis is the same, implying a common ancestor. There is a similar mechanism for the back-belly axis for bilaterian animals, but it is reversed between arthropods and vertebrates. Another process, gastrulation of the embryo, is driven by Myosin II molecular motors, which are not conserved across species. The process may have been started by movements of sea water in the environment, later replaced by the evolution of tissue movements in the embryo.\nThe origins of novelty.\nAmong the more surprising and, perhaps, counterintuitive (from a neo-Darwinian viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology is that the diversity of body plans and morphology in organisms across many phyla are not necessarily reflected in diversity at the level of the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: \"where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change\". So, if the observed morphological novelty between different clades does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by mutation), where does it come from? Novelty may arise by mutation-driven changes in gene regulation.\nVariations in the toolkit.\nVariations in the toolkit may have produced a large part of the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways. A toolkit gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin's large ground-finch was enlarged by the \"BMP\" gene, or when snakes lost their legs as \"distal-less\" became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form their limbs. Or, a toolkit gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, \"distal-less\", which controls such diverse structures as the mandible in vertebrates, legs and antennae in the fruit fly, and eyespot pattern in butterfly wings. Given that small changes in toolbox genes can cause significant changes in body structures, they have often enabled the same function convergently or in parallel. \"distal-less\" generates wing patterns in the butterflies \"Heliconius erato\" and \"Heliconius melpomene\", which are M\u00fcllerian mimics. In so-called facilitated variation, their wing patterns arose in different evolutionary events, but are controlled by the same genes. Developmental changes can contribute directly to speciation.\nConsolidation of epigenetic changes.\nEvolutionary innovation may sometimes begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by changes at the gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. M\u00fcller have suggested that organisms early in the history of multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.\nDevelopmental bias.\nDevelopment in specific lineages can be biased either positively, towards a given trajectory or phenotype, or negatively, away from producing certain types of change; either may be absolute (the change is always or never produced) or relative. Evidence for any such direction in evolution is however hard to acquire and can also result from developmental constraints that limit diversification. For example, in the gastropods, the snail-type shell is always built as a tube that grows both in length and in diameter; selection has created a wide variety of shell shapes such as flat spirals, cowries and tall turret spirals within these constraints. Among the centipedes, the Lithobiomorpha always have 15 trunk segments as adults, probably the result of a developmental bias towards an odd number of trunk segments. Another centipede order, the Geophilomorpha, the number of segments varies in different species between 27 and 191, but the number is always odd, making this an absolute constraint; almost all the odd numbers in that range are occupied by one or another species.\nEcological evolutionary developmental biology.\nEcological evolutionary developmental biology, informally known as eco-evo-devo, integrates research from developmental biology and ecology to examine their relationship with evolutionary theory. Researchers study concepts and mechanisms such as developmental plasticity, epigenetic inheritance, genetic assimilation, niche construction and symbiosis.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is named after the Russian geographer and explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky. Once extinct in the wild, since the 1990s it has been reintroduced to its native habitat in Mongolia in the Hustai National Park, Takhin Tal Nature Reserve, Khomiin Tal, and several other locales in Central Asia and Eastern Europe.\nSeveral genetic characteristics of Przewalski's horse differ from those seen in modern domestic horses, indicating neither is an ancestor of the other. For example, Przewalski's horse has 33 chromosome pairs, compared to 32 for the domestic horse. Their ancestral lineages split from a common ancestor between 160,000 and 38,000 years ago, long before the domestication of the horse. Przewalski's horse was long considered the only remaining truly wild horse, in contrast with the American mustang and the Australian brumby, which are instead feral horses descended from domesticated animals. That status was called into question when domestic horses of the 5,000-year-old Botai culture of Central Asia were found to be more closely related to Przewalski's horses than to \"E. f. caballus\". The study raised the possibility that modern Przewalski's horses could be the feral descendants of the domestic Botai horses. However, it remains possible that both the Botai horses and the modern Przewalski's horses descend separately from the same ancient wild Przewalski's horse population. Its taxonomic position is still debated, with some taxonomists treating Przewalski's horse as a species, \"E.\u00a0przewalskii\", others as a subspecies of wild horse (\"E.\u00a0ferus przewalskii\") or a variety of the domesticated horse (\"E. ferus caballus\").\nPrzewalski's horse is stockily built, smaller, and shorter than its domesticated relatives. Typical height is about 12\u201314\u00a0hands (\u2013\u00a0inches, \u2013\u00a0cm), and the average weight is around . They have a dun coat with \"pangar\u00e9\" features and often have dark primitive markings.\nTaxonomy.\nPrzewalski's horse was formally described as a novel species in 1881 by . The taxonomic position of Przewalski's horse remains controversial, and no consensus exists about whether it is a full species (as \"Equus przewalskii\"); a subspecies of \"Equus ferus\" the wild horse (as \"Equus ferus przewalskii\" in trinomial nomenclature, along with two other subspecies, the domestic horse \"E.\u00a0f.\u00a0caballus\", and the extinct tarpan \"E.\u00a0f.\u00a0ferus\"); or even a subpopulation of the domestic horse. The American Society of Mammalogists considers Przewalski's horse and the tarpan both to be subspecies of \"Equus ferus\", and classifies the domestic horse as a separate species, \"Equus caballus\".\nLineage.\nGenetic analysis shows that the takhi and the domestic horse differ significantly, with neither ancestral to the other. The evolutionary divergence of the two populations was estimated to have occurred about 72,000\u201338,000 years ago, well before domestication, most likely due to climate, topography, or other environmental changes.\nAccording to a 2009 study, the earliest known domestic horses were found at settlements of the Botai culture, from about 5500 years ago. These horses were raised for meat and milk. In 2018, a new study indicated ancient horses of the Botai culture are related to takhis, not to domestic horses as was previously thought. Specifically, the Botai horses appeared to be ancestral to the modern takhi, because all seven takhis nested within the phylogenetic tree of the 20 Botai horses. No comparison was made to definitively wild early takhis. The authors posit that modern Przewalski's horses are feral descendants of the ancient Botai domesticated animals, rather than representing a surviving population of never-domesticated horses. Another geneticist pointed out that Przewalski's horses may have simply descended from the same wild population that the Botai horses came from, which would still be compatible with the findings of the study.\nIn 2021, William Taylor and Christina Barron-Ortiz disputed the evidence for domestication of Przewalski's horse. Their case was rejected by Alan Outram and colleagues in a paper which was not dated or peer-reviewed. Taylor reiterated his arguments that Przewalski's horse had never been domesticated in an article in \"Scientific American\" in 2024.\nIn any case, the Botai horses were found to have negligible genetic contribution to any of the ancient or modern domestic horses studied, indicating that the domestication of the latter was independent, involving a different wild population, from any possible domestication of Przewalski's horse by the Botai culture.\nCharacteristics.\nPrzewalski's horse is stockily built in comparison to domesticated horses, with shorter legs, and is much smaller and shorter than its domesticated relatives. Typical height is about 12\u201314\u00a0hands (\u2013\u00a0inches, \u2013\u00a0cm), and length is about . It weighs around . The coat is generally dun in color with \"pangar\u00e9\" features, varying from dark brown around the mane, to pale brown on the flanks, and yellowish-white on the belly, as well as around the muzzle. The legs of Przewalski's horse are often faintly striped, also typical of primitive markings. The mane stands erect and does not extend as far forward, while the tail is about long, with a longer dock and shorter hair than seen in domesticated horses. The hooves of Przewalski's horse are longer in the front and have significantly thicker sole horns than feral horses, an adaptation that improves hoof performance on terrain.\nGenomics.\nThe karyotype of Przewalski's horse differs from that of the domestic horse, having 33\u00a0chromosome pairs versus\u00a032, apparently due to a fission of a large chromosome ancestral to domestic horse chromosome\u00a05 to produce Przewalski's horse chromosomes\u00a023 and 24, though conversely, a Robertsonian translocation that fused two chromosomes ancestral to those seen in Przewalski's horse to produce the single large domestic horse chromosome has also been proposed.\nMany smaller inversions, insertions and other rearrangements were observed between the chromosomes of domestic and Przewalski's horses, while there was much lower heterozygosity in Przewalski's horses, with extensive segments devoid of genetic diversity, a consequence of the recent severe bottleneck of the captive Przewalski's horse population. In comparison, the chromosomal differences between domestic horses and zebras include numerous large-scale translocations, fusions, inversions, and centromere repositioning. Przewalski's horse has the highest diploid chromosome number among all equine species. They can interbreed with the domestic horse and produce fertile offspring, with 65\u00a0chromosomes.\nThe mitochondrial genome has 37 genes that are 99.63% identical to that of the domestic horse.\nEcology and behavior.\nPrzewalski reported the horses forming troops of between five and fifteen members, consisting of a mature stallion, his mares and foals. Modern reintroduced populations similarly form family groups of one adult stallion, one to three mares, and their common offspring that stay in the family group until they are no longer dependent, usually at two or three years old. Young females join other harems, while bachelor stallions as well as old stallions who have lost their harems join bachelor groups. Family groups can join to form a herd that moves together.\nThe patterns of their daily lives exhibit horse behavior similar to that of feral horse herds. Stallions herd, drive, and defend all members of their family, while the mares often display leadership in the family. Stallions and mares stay with their preferred partners for years. While behavioral synchronization is high among mares, stallions other than the main harem stallion are generally less stable in this respect.\nHome range in the wild is little studied, but estimated as in the Hustai National Park and in the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area. The ranges of harems are separated, but slightly overlapping. They have few modern predators, but one of the few is the Himalayan wolf.\nHorses maintain visual contact with their family and herd at all times, and have a host of ways to communicate with one another, including vocalizations, scent marking, and a wide range of visual and tactile signals. Each kick, groom, tilt of the ear, or other contact with another horse is a means of communicating. This constant communication leads to complex social behaviors among Przewalski's horses.\nThe historical population was said to have lived in the \"wildest parts of the desert\" with a preference for \"especially saline districts\". They were observed mostly during spring and summer at natural wells, migrating to them by crossing valleys rather than by way of higher mountains.\nDiet.\nPrzewalski horse's diet consists of vegetation. In the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Przewalski's horses consume primarily grasses and forbs, including \"Elymus repens\", \"Carex \"spp., Fabaceae, and Asteraceae.\nLooking at the species' diet overall, Przewalski's horses most often eat \"E.\u00a0repens\", \"Trifolium pratense\", \"Vicia cracca\", \"Poa trivialis\", \"Dactylis glomerata\", and \"Bromus inermis\". While the horses eat a variety of different plant species, they tend to favor different species at different times of year. In the springtime, they favor \"Elymus repens\", \"Corynephorus canescens\", \"Festuca valesiaca,\" and \"Chenopodium album\". In early summer, they favor \"Dactylis glomerata\" and \"Trifolium\", and in late summer, they gravitate towards \"E.\u00a0repens\" and \"Vicia cracca\".\nIn winter the horses eat \"Salix \"spp., \"Pyrus communis\", \"Malus sylvatica\", \"Pinus sylvestris\", \"Rosa\" spp., and \"Alnus\" spp. Additionally, Przewalski's horses may dig for \"Festuca\" spp., \"Bromus inermis\", and \"E.\u00a0repens\" that grow beneath the ice and snow. Their winter diet is very similar to the winter diet of domestic horses, but differs from that revealed by isotope analysis of the historical (pre-captivity) population, which switched in winter to browsing shrubs, though the difference may be due to the extreme habitat pressure the historical population was under. In the wintertime, they eat their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Przewalski's horses seasonally display a set of changes collectively characteristic of physiologic adaptation to starvation, with their basal metabolic rate in winter being half what it is during springtime. This is not a direct consequence of decreased nutrient intake, but rather a programmed response to predictable seasonal dietary fluctuation.\nReproduction.\nMating occurs in late spring or early summer. Mating stallions do not start looking for mating partners until the age of five. Stallions assemble groups of mares or challenge the leader of another group for dominance. Females are able to give birth at the age of three and have a gestation period of 11\u201312\u00a0months. Foals are able to stand about an hour after birth. The rate of infant mortality among foals is 25%, with 83.3% of these deaths resulting from leading stallion infanticide. Foals begin grazing within a few weeks but are not weaned for 8\u201313 months after birth. They reach sexual maturity at two years of age.\nPopulation.\nHistory.\nPrzewalski's-type wild horses appear in European cave art dating as far back as 20,000 years ago, but genetic investigation of a 35,870-year-old specimen from one such cave instead showed an affinity with extinct Iberian horse lineage and the modern domestic horse, suggesting that it was not Przewalski's horse being depicted in this art. Horse skeletons dating to the fifth to the third millennia BCE, found in Central Asia, with a range extending to the southern Urals and the Altai, belong to the genetic lineage of Przewalski's horse. Of particular note are the horses of this lineage found in the archaeological sites of the Chalcolithic Botai culture. Sites dating from the mid-fourth-millennium BCE show evidence of horse domestication. Analysis of ancient DNA from Botai horse specimens from about 3000 BCE reveals them to have DNA markers consistent with the lineage of modern Przewalski's horses.\nThere are sporadic reports of Przewalski's horse in the historical record before its formal characterization. The Buddhist monk Bodowa wrote a description of what is thought to have been Przewalski's horse about AD 900, and an account from 1226 reports an incident involving wild horses during Genghis Khan's campaign against the Tangut empire. In the fifteenth century, Johann Schiltberger recorded one of the first European sightings of the horses in the journal recounting his trip to Mongolia as a prisoner of the Mongol Khan. Another was recorded as a gift to the Manchurian emperor around 1630, its value as a gift suggesting a difficulty in obtaining them. John Bell, a Scottish doctor in service to Peter the Great from 1719 to 1722, observed a horse in Russia's Tomsk Oblast that was apparently this species, and a few decades later in 1750, a large hunt with thousands of beaters organized by the Manchurian emperor killed between two and three hundred of these horses.\nThe species is named after a Russian colonel of Polish descent, Nikolai Przhevalsky (1839\u20131888) (Niko\u0142aj Przewalski in Polish). An explorer and naturalist, he obtained the skull and hide of an animal shot in 1878 in the Gobi near today's China\u2013Mongolia border. He would travel to the Dzungarian Basin to observe it in the wild. In 1881, the horse received a formal scientific description and was named \"Equus przevalskii\" by Ivan Semyonovich Polyakov, based on Przewalski's collection and description, while in 1884, the sole exemplar of the horse in Europe was a preserved specimen in the Museum of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. This was supplemented in 1894 when the brothers Grum-Grzhimailo returned several hides and skulls to St. Petersburg and described the horse's behavior in the wild. A number of these horses were captured around 1900 by Carl Hagenbeck and placed in zoos, and these, along with one later captive, reproduced to give rise to today's population.\nAfter 1903, there were no reports of the wild population until 1947, when several isolated groups were observed and a lone filly captured. Although local herdsmen reported seeing as many as 50 to 100 takhis grazing in small groups then, there were only sporadic sightings of single groups of two or three animals after that, mostly near natural wells. Two scientific expeditions in 1955 and 1962 failed to find any. After herders and naturalists reported single harem groups in 1966 and 1967, the last observation of the wild horse in its native habitat was of a single stallion in 1969. Expeditions after this failed to locate any horses, and the species would be designated \"extinct in the wild\" for over 30\u00a0years. Competition with livestock, hunting, capture of foals for zoological collections, military activities, and harsh winters recorded in 1945, 1948, and 1956 are considered to be main causes of the decline in Przewalski's horse population.\nThe wild population was already rare at its first scientific characterization. Przewalski reported seeing them only from a distance and may have instead sighted herds of local onager Mongolian wild asses. He was only able to obtain specimens of the type from Kirghiz hunters. The range of Przewalski's horse was limited to the arid Dzungarian Basin in the Gobi Desert. It has been suggested that this was not their natural habitat, but, like the onager, they were a steppe animal driven to this barren last refuge by the dual pressures of hunting and habitat loss to agricultural grazing. There were two distinct populations recognized by local Mongolians, a lighter steppe variety and a darker mountain one. This distinction is seen in early twentieth-century descriptions. Their mountainous habitat included the \"Takhiin Shar Nuruu\" (The Yellow Wild-Horse Mountain Range). In their last decades in the wild, the remnant population was limited to the small region between the Takhiin Shar Nuruu and Bajtag-Bogdo mountain ridges.\nCaptivity.\nAttempts to obtain specimens for exhibit and captive breeding were largely unsuccessful until 1902, when 28\u00a0captured foals were brought to Europe. These and a small number of additional captives would be distributed among zoos and breeding centers in Europe and the United States. Many facilities failed in their attempts at captive breeding, but a few programs were established. However, by the mid-1930s, inbreeding had caused reduced fertility, and the captive population experienced a genetic bottleneck, with the surviving captive breeding stock descended from only 11 of the founder captives. In addition, in at least one instance, the progeny of interbreeding with a domestic horse was bred back into the captive Przewalski's horse population. However, recent studies have shown only minimal genetic contribution of this domestic horse to the captive population.\nThe situation was improved when the exchange of breeding animals among facilities increased genetic diversity and there was a consequent improvement in fertility, but the population experienced another genetic bottleneck when many of the horses failed to survive World War\u00a0II. The most valuable group, in Askania Nova, Ukraine, was shot by German soldiers during World War\u00a0II occupation, and the group in the United States had died out. Only two captive populations in zoos remained, in Munich and in Prague, and of the 31\u00a0remaining horses at war's end, only 9 became ancestors of the subsequent captive population. By the end of the 1950s, only 12\u00a0individual horses were left in the world's zoos.\nA wild-caught mare captured as a foal a decade earlier was introduced into the Ukrainian captive population in 1957. This would prove the last wild-caught horse, and with the presumed extinction of the wild population, last sighted in Mongolia in the late 1960s, the captive population became the sole representatives of Przewalski's horse. Genetic diversity received a much-needed boost from this new source, with the spread of her bloodline through the inbred captive groups leading to their increased reproductive success, and by 1965, there were more than 130 animals spread among thirty-two zoos and parks.\nConservation efforts.\nIn 1977, the Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse was founded in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, by Jan and Inge Bouman. The foundation started a program of exchange between captive populations in zoos worldwide to reduce inbreeding and later began its own breeding program. As a result of such efforts, the extant herd has retained a far greater genetic diversity than its genetic bottleneck made likely. By 1979, when this concerted program of population management to maximize genetic diversity was begun, there were almost four hundred horses in sixteen facilities, a number that had grown by the early 1990s to over 1,500.\nWhile dozens of zoos worldwide have Przewalski's horses in small numbers, specialized reserves are also dedicated primarily to the species. The world's largest captive-breeding program for Przewalski's horses is at the Askania Nova preserve in Ukraine. From 1998, thirty-one horses were also released in the unenclosed Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine and Belarus. People evacuated the zone after the Chernobyl accident, so now it serves as a deserted \"de facto\" nature reserve. Though poaching has taken a toll on numbers, as of 2019 the estimated population in the Chernobyl zone was over 100 individuals.\nLe Villaret, located in the Cevennes National Park in southern France and run by the Association Takh, is a breeding site for Przewalski's horses that was created to allow the free expression of natural Przewalski's horse behaviors. In 1993, eleven zoo-born horses were brought to Le Villaret. Horses born there are adapted to life in the wild, free to choose their mates, and required to forage independently. This was intended to produce individuals capable of being reintroduced into Mongolia. In 2012, 39 individuals were at Le Villaret. An intensely researched population of free-ranging animals was also introduced to the Hortob\u00e1gy National Park \"puszta\" in Hungary; data on social structure, behavior, and diseases gathered from these animals are used to improve the Mongolian conservation effort. An additional breeding population of Przewalski's horses roams the former D\u00f6beritzer Heide military proving ground, now a nature reserve in Dallgow-D\u00f6beritz, Germany. Established in 2008, this population comprised 24 horses in 2019. Another population is being established in the Iberian System in Spain, the first free-roaming Przewalski's horses in Western Europe.\nIn 2024, a Colorado rancher discovered what appears to be a Przewalski's horse at a Kansas livestock auction, mistakenly identified as a mule. Another similar horse was found at a Utah sanctuary. Genetic tests suggest both are Przewalski's horses, raising concerns about how they ended up in U.S. auctions. One horse, Fiona, was euthanized following apparent organ failure, while the other's fate is unreported.\nReintroduction.\nThe Przewalski's Horse Reintroduction Project of China was initiated in 1985 when 11\u00a0wild horses were imported from overseas. After more than two decades of effort, the Xinjiang Wild Horse Breeding Centre has bred a large number of horses, 55 of which were released into the Kalamely Mountain area. The animals quickly adapted to their new environment. In 1988, six foals were born and survived, and by 2001, over 100\u00a0horses were at the centre. As of 2013[ [update]], the center hosted 127 horses divided into 13\u00a0breeding herds and three bachelor herds. \nReintroductions organized by Western European countries started in the 1990s. Several populations have now been released into the wild. A cooperative venture between the Zoological Society of London and Mongolian scientists has successfully reintroduced these horses from zoos into their natural habitat in Mongolia. In 1992, 16 horses were released into the wild in Mongolia, followed by additional animals later. One of the areas to which they were reintroduced became Khustain Nuruu National Park in 1998. Another reintroduction site is Great Gobi\u00a0B Strictly Protected Area, located at the fringes of the Gobi Desert. \nIn 2001, Przewalski's horses were reintroduced into the Kalamaili Nature Reserve in Xinjiang, China. \nSince 2004, there has been a program to reintroduce Przewalski's horses that were bred in France into Mongolia. Instrumental to that 2004 reintroduction was Claudia Feh, a Swiss equine specialist and conservation biologist. Feh led an effort to bring together animals that zoos had conserved to create a breeding population in southern France. Then, after it was established, three family groups were relocated to Khovd in western Mongolia. At a site on the northern edge of the Gobi Desert, Feh worked in cooperation with local people to ensure the horses survived and flourished. For this work, Feh received a Rolex Award in 2004.\nIn 2004 and 2005, 22\u00a0horses were released by the Association Takh to a third reintroduction site in the buffer zone of the Khar Us Nuur National Park, in the northern edge of the Gobi ecoregion. In the winter of 2009\u20132010, one of the worst \"dzud\" or snowy winter conditions ever hit Mongolia. The population of Przewalski's horse in the Great Gobi B SPA was drastically affected, providing clear evidence of the risks associated with reintroducing small and sequestered species in unpredictable and unfamiliar environments. \nAfter reintroduced horses had successfully reproduced, the status of the animal was changed from \"extinct in the wild\" to \"endangered\" in 2005, while on the IUCN Red List they were reclassified from \"extinct in the wild\" to \"critically endangered\", after a reassessment in 2008, and from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered\" after a 2011 reassessment. \nIn 2011, Prague Zoo started a new project, Return of the Wild Horses. With the support of public and many strategic partners, yearly transports of captive-bred horses into the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area continued. as of 2011[ [update]], an estimated total of almost 400\u00a0horses existed in three free-ranging populations in the wild. Prague Zoo has transported horses to Mongolia in several rounds in cooperation with partners (Czech Air Force, European Breeding Programme for Przewalski's Horses, Association pour le cheval de Przewalski: Takh, Czech Development Agency, Czech Embassy in Mongolia, and others). The zoo has the longest uninterrupted history of breeding Przewalski's horses in the world and keeps the studbook of this species. \nThe first reintroduction into the Orenburg region on the Russian steppe occurred in 2016. \nIn May 2023, a herd of ten Przewalski's horses obtained from Monts D'Azur Biological Reserve in France was introduced by Rewilding Europe to the Iberian Highlands rewilding landscape in Spain, near Villanueva de Alcor\u00f3n. Following an acclimatization period, the horses were released into the reserve proper in September. This introduction was intended to address the buildup of dense scrub caused by the decrease in traditional sheep grazing due to rural depopulation. The horses are intended to fill a niche similar to that of the extinct European wild horse and of contemporary domesticated herbivores by opening the landscape through low-intensity grazing and browsing, thereby enhancing biodiversity and lowering the risk of forest fires. Future introductions are planned. \nIn June 2024 six mares and a stallion were reintroduced to Kazakhstan from zoos in Europe, ten years after plans were announced to do so. The operation was organised by Prague Zoo, which selected horses from various programs in Europe, which were housed at Tierpark Berlin for some months before being transported to Kazakhstan in Czech army planes.\nAssisted reproduction and cloning.\nIn the earlier decades of captivity, the insular breeding by individual zoos led to inbreeding and reduced fertility. In 1979, several American zoos began a collaborative breeding-exchange program to maximize genetic diversity. Recent advances in equine reproductive science have also been used to preserve and expand the gene pool. Scientists at the Smithsonian Institution's National Zoo successfully reversed a vasectomy on a Przewalski horse in 2007\u2014the first operation of its kind on this species, and possibly the first ever on any endangered species. While normally, a vasectomy may be performed on an endangered animal under limited circumstances, particularly if an individual has already produced many offspring and its genes are overrepresented in the population, scientists realized the animal in question was one of the most genetically valuable Przewalski's horses in the North American breeding program. The first birth by artificial insemination occurred on 27 July 2013 at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.\nIn 2020, the first cloned Przewalski's horse was born, the result of a collaboration between San Diego Zoo Global, ViaGen Equine and Revive &amp; Restore. The cloning was carried out by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), whereby a viable embryo is created by transplanting the DNA-containing nucleus of a somatic cell into an immature egg cell (oocyte) that has had its nucleus removed, producing offspring genetically identical to the somatic cell donor. Since the oocyte used was from a domestic horse, this was an example of interspecies SCNT.\nThe somatic cell donor was a Przewalski horse stallion named Kuporovic, born in the UK in 1975 and relocated three years later to the US, where he died in 1998. Due to concerns over the loss of genetic variation in the captive Przewalski's horse population, and in anticipation of the development of new cloning techniques, tissue from the stallion was cryopreserved at the San Diego Zoo's Frozen Zoo. Breeding of this individual in the 1980s had already substantially increased the genetic diversity of the captive population after he was discovered to have more unique alleles than any other horse living at the time, including otherwise lost genetic material from two of the original captive founders. To produce the clone, frozen skin fibroblasts were thawed, and grown in cell culture. An oocyte was collected from a domestic horse, and its nucleus replaced by a nucleus collected from a cultured Przewalski's horse fibroblast. The resulting embryo was induced to begin division. It was cultured until it reached the blastocyst stage, then implanted into a domestic horse surrogate mare, which carried the embryo to term and delivered a foal with the Przewalski horse DNA of the long-deceased stallion.\nThe cloned horse was named Kurt, after Dr. Kurt Benirschke, a geneticist who developed the idea of cryopreserving genetic material from species considered to be endangered. His ideas led to creating the Frozen Zoo as a genetic library. In 2021, Kurt was relocated to the breeding herd at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. In order to integrate him into the existing herd, Kurt was partnered with a young female named Holly, a few months older than him, in order to allow him to learn the social and communication behaviors of wild Przewalski's horses. On reaching maturity at three to four years of age, Kurt is intended to become the breeder stallion for the San Diego Zoo herd to pass Kuporovic's genes into the larger captive Przewalski's horse population and thereby increase the genetic variation of the species.\nIn 2023, a genetic twin of Kurt, named Ollie, was born from cloning with the help of the San Diego Zoo Global Frozen Zoo. It is the first reported case of any endangered species having more than one clone successfully produced. This individual eventually joins Kurt and Holly at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. Due to having been conceived through the transfer of a somatic cell nucleus into an egg cell obtained from a domestic horse donor, Kurt and Ollie both display the mitochondrial genome of domestic horses instead of belonging to a Przewalski horse mitochondrial clade. However, as mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited, they will not pass on these domestic horse genes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a potent irritant for mammals, including humans, for which it produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related amides (capsaicinoids) are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, likely as deterrents against eating by mammals and against the growth of fungi. Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic, colorless, highly pungent (i.e., spicy) crystalline solid.\nNatural function.\nCapsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes and, to a lesser extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus \"Capsicum\". The seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith of the inner wall, where the seeds are attached.\nThe seeds of \"Capsicum\" plants are dispersed predominantly by birds. In birds, the TRPV1 channel does not respond to capsaicin or related chemicals, but mammalian TRPV1 is very sensitive to it. This is advantageous to the plant, as chili pepper seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and can germinate later, whereas mammals have molar teeth that destroy such seeds and prevent them from germinating. Thus, natural selection may have led to increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it disperse. There is also evidence that capsaicin may have evolved as an anti-fungal agent. The fungal pathogen \"Fusarium\", which is known to infect wild chilies and thereby reduce seed viability, is deterred by capsaicin, which thus limits this form of predispersal seed mortality.\nThe vanillotoxin-containing venom of a certain tarantula species (\"Psalmopoeus cambridgei)\" activates the same pathway of pain as is activated by capsaicin. It is an example of a shared pathway in both plant and animal anti-mammalian defense.\nUses.\nFood.\nBecause of the burning sensation caused by capsaicin when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, it is commonly used in food products to provide added spiciness or \"heat\" (piquancy), usually in the form of spices such as chili powder and paprika. In high concentrations, capsaicin will also cause a burning effect on other sensitive areas, such as skin or eyes. The degree of heat found within a food is often measured on the Scoville scale.\nThere has long been a demand for capsaicin-spiced products like chili pepper, and hot sauces such as Tabasco sauce and Mexican salsa. It is common for people to experience pleasurable and even euphoric effects from ingesting capsaicin. Folklore among self-described \"chiliheads\" attribute this to pain-stimulated release of endorphins, a different mechanism from the local receptor overload that makes capsaicin effective as a topical analgesic.\nResearch and pharmaceutical use.\nCapsaicin is used as an analgesic in topical ointments and dermal patches to relieve pain, typically in concentrations between 0.025% and 0.1%. It may be applied in cream form for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with arthritis, backache, strains and sprains, often in compounds with other rubefacients.\nIt is also used to reduce the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as post-herpetic neuralgia caused by shingles. A capsaicin transdermal patch (\"Qutenza\") for the management of this particular therapeutic indication (pain due to post-herpetic neuralgia) was approved in 2009, as a therapeutic by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Union. A subsequent application to the FDA for Qutenza to be used as an analgesic in HIV neuralgia was refused. One 2017 review of clinical studies found, with limited quality, that high-dose topical capsaicin (8%) compared with control (0.4% capsaicin) provided moderate to substantial pain relief from post-herpetic neuralgia, HIV-neuropathy, and diabetic neuropathy.\nAlthough capsaicin creams have been used to treat psoriasis for reduction of itching, a review of six clinical trials involving topical capsaicin for treatment of pruritus concluded there was insufficient evidence of effect. Oral capsaicin decreases LDL cholesterol levels moderately.\nThere is insufficient clinical evidence to determine the role of ingested capsaicin on several human disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases.\nPepper spray and pests.\nCapsaicinoids are also an active ingredient in riot control and personal defense pepper spray agents. When the spray comes in contact with skin, especially eyes or mucous membranes, it produces pain and breathing difficulty in the affected individual.\nCapsaicin is also used to deter pests, specifically mammalian pests. Targets of capsaicin repellants include voles, deer, rabbits, squirrels, bears, insects, and attacking dogs. Ground or crushed dried chili pods may be used in birdseed to deter rodents, taking advantage of the insensitivity of birds to capsaicin. The Elephant Pepper Development Trust claims that using chili peppers as a barrier crop can be a sustainable means for rural African farmers to deter elephants from eating their crops.\nAn article published in the \"Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part B\" in 2006 states that \"Although hot chili pepper extract is commonly used as a component of household and garden insect-repellent formulas, it is not clear that the capsaicinoid elements of the extract are responsible for its repellency.\"\nThe first pesticide product using solely capsaicin as the active ingredient was registered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1962.\nEquestrian sports.\nCapsaicin is a banned substance in equestrian sports because of its hypersensitizing and pain-relieving properties. At the show jumping events of the 2008 Summer Olympics, four horses tested positive for capsaicin, which resulted in disqualification.\nIrritant effects.\nAcute health effects.\nCapsaicin is a strong irritant requiring proper protective goggles, respirators, and proper hazardous material-handling procedures. Capsaicin takes effect upon skin contact (irritant, sensitizer), eye contact (irritant), ingestion, and inhalation (lung irritant, lung sensitizer). The LD50 in mice is 47.2\u00a0mg/kg.\nPainful exposures to capsaicin-containing peppers are among the most common plant-related exposures presented to poison centers. They cause burning or stinging pain to the skin and, if ingested in large amounts by adults or small amounts by children, can produce nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and burning diarrhea. Eye exposure produces intense tearing, pain, conjunctivitis, and blepharospasm.\nTreatment after exposure.\nThe primary treatment is removal of the offending substance. Plain water is ineffective at removing capsaicin. Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items.\nWhen capsaicin is ingested, cold milk may be an effective way to relieve the burning sensation due to caseins in milk, and the water of milk acts as a surfactant, allowing the capsaicin to form an emulsion with it.\nWeight loss and regain.\nAs of 2007, there was no evidence showing that weight loss is directly correlated with ingesting capsaicin. Well-designed clinical research had not been performed because the pungency of capsaicin in prescribed doses under research prevented subjects from complying in the study. A 2014 meta-analysis of further trials found weak evidence that consuming capsaicin before a meal might slightly reduce the amount of food consumed, and might drive food preference toward carbohydrates.\nPeptic ulcer.\nOne 2006 review concluded that capsaicin may relieve symptoms of a peptic ulcer rather than being a cause of it.\nDeath.\nIngestion of high quantities of capsaicin can be deadly, particularly in people with heart problems. Even healthy young people can suffer adverse health effects like myocardial infarction after ingestion of capsaicin capsules.\nMechanism of action.\nThe burning and painful sensations associated with capsaicin result from \"defunctionalization\" of nociceptor nerve fibers by causing a topical hypersensitivity reaction in the skin. As a member of the vanilloid family, capsaicin binds to a receptor on nociceptor fibers called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1). TRPV1, which can also be stimulated with heat, protons, and physical abrasion, permits cations to pass through the cell membrane when activated. The resulting depolarization of the neuron stimulates it to send impulses to the brain. By binding to TRPV1 receptors, capsaicin produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, such as warming, tingling, itching, or stinging, explaining why capsaicin is described as an irritant on the skin and eyes or by ingestion.\nClarifying the mechanisms of capsaicin effects on skin nociceptors was part of awarding the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, as it led to the discovery of skin sensors for temperature and touch, and identification of the single gene causing sensitivity to capsaicin.\nHistory.\nThe compound was first extracted in impure form in 1816 by Christian Friedrich Bucholz (1770\u20131818).\nIn 1873 German pharmacologist Rudolf Buchheim (1820\u20131879) and in 1878 the Hungarian doctor Endre H\u0151gyes stated that \"capsicol\" (partially purified capsaicin) caused the burning feeling when in contact with mucous membranes and increased secretion of gastric acid.\nCapsaicinoids.\nThe most commonly occurring capsaicinoids are capsaicin (69%), dihydrocapsaicin (22%), nordihydrocapsaicin (7%), homocapsaicin (1%), and homodihydrocapsaicin (1%).\nCapsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin (both 16.0 million SHU) are the most pungent capsaicinoids. Nordihydrocapsaicin (9.1 million SHU), homocapsaicin and homodihydrocapsaicin (both 8.6 million SHU) are about half as hot.\nThere are six natural capsaicinoids (table below). Although vanillylamide of n-nonanoic acid (Nonivamide, VNA, also PAVA) is produced synthetically for most applications, it does occur naturally in \"Capsicum\" species.\nBiosynthesis.\nHistory.\nThe general biosynthetic pathway of capsaicin and other capsaicinoids was elucidated in the 1960s by Bennett and Kirby, and Leete and Louden. Radiolabeling studies identified phenylalanine and valine as the precursors to capsaicin. Enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), caffeic acid \"O\"-methyltransferase (COMT) and their function in capsaicinoid biosynthesis were identified later by Fujiwake et al., and Sukrasno and Yeoman. Suzuki et al. are responsible for identifying leucine as another precursor to the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. It was discovered in 1999 that pungency of chili peppers is related to higher transcription levels of key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, caffeic acid \"O\"-methyltransferase. Similar studies showed high transcription levels in the placenta of chili peppers with high pungency of genes responsible for branched-chain fatty acid pathway.\nBiosynthetic pathway.\nPlants exclusively of the genus \"Capsicum\" produce capsaicinoids, which are alkaloids. Capsaicin is believed to be synthesized in the interlocular septum of chili peppers and depends on the gene \"AT3\", which resides at the \"pun1\" locus, and which encodes a putative acyltransferase.\nBiosynthesis of the capsaicinoids occurs in the glands of the pepper fruit where capsaicin synthase condenses vanillylamine from the phenylpropanoid pathway with an acyl-CoA moiety produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway.\nCapsaicin is the most abundant capsaicinoid found in the genus \"Capsicum\", but at least ten other capsaicinoid variants exist. Phenylalanine supplies the precursor to the phenylpropanoid pathway while leucine or valine provide the precursor for the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. To produce capsaicin, 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-CoA is produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway and condensed with vanillylamine. Other capsaicinoids are produced by the condensation of vanillylamine with various acyl-CoA products from the branched-chain fatty acid pathway, which is capable of producing a variety of acyl-CoA moieties of different chain length and degrees of unsaturation. All condensation reactions between the products of the phenylpropanoid and branched-chain fatty acid pathway are mediated by capsaicin synthase to produce the final capsaicinoid product.\nEvolution.\nThe \"Capsicum\" genus split from \"Solanaceae\" 19.6 million years ago, 5.4 million years after the appearance of \"Solanaceae\", and is native only to the Americas. Chilies only started to quickly evolve in the past 2 million years into markedly different species. This evolution can be partially attributed to a key compound found in peppers, 8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide, otherwise known as capsaicin. Capsaicin evolved similarly across species of chilies that produce capsaicin. Its evolution over the course of centuries is due to genetic drift and natural selection, across the genus \"Capsicum\". Despite the fact that chilies within the \"Capsicum\" genus are found in diverse environments, the capsaicin found within them all exhibit similar properties that serve as defensive and adaptive features. Capsaicin evolved to preserve the fitness of peppers against fungi infections, insects, and granivorous mammals.\nAntifungal properties.\nCapsaicin acts as an antifungal agent in four primary ways. First, capsaicin inhibits the metabolic rate of the cells that make up the fungal biofilm. This inhibits the area and growth rate of the fungus, since the biofilm creates an area where a fungus can grow and adhere to the chili in which capsaicin is present. Capsaicin also inhibits fungal hyphae formation, which impacts the amount of nutrients that the rest of the fungal body can receive. Thirdly, capsaicin disrupts the structure of fungal cells and the fungal cell membranes. This has consequential negative impacts on the integrity of fungal cells and their ability to survive and proliferate. Additionally, the ergosterol synthesis of growing fungi decreases in relation to the amount of capsaicin present in the growth area. This impacts the fungal cell membrane, and how it is able to reproduce and adapt to stressors in its environment.\nInsecticidal properties.\nCapsaicin deters insects in multiple ways. The first is by deterring insects from laying their eggs on the pepper due to the effects capsaicin has on these insects. Capsaicin can cause intestinal dysplasia upon ingestion, disrupting insect metabolism and causing damage to cell membranes within the insect. This in turn disrupts the standard feeding response of insects.\nSeed dispersion and deterrents against granivorous mammals.\nGranivorous mammals pose a risk to the propagation of chilies because their molars grind the seeds of chilies, rendering them unable to grow into new chili plants. As a result, modern chilies evolved defense mechanisms to mitigate the risk of granivorous mammals. While capsaicin is present at some level in every part of the pepper, the chemical has its highest concentration in the tissue near the seeds within chilies. Birds are able to eat chilies, then disperse the seeds in their excrement, enabling propagation.\nAdaptation to varying moisture levels.\nCapsaicin is a potent defense mechanism for chilies, but it does come at a cost. Varying levels of capsaicin in chilies currently appear to be caused by an evolutionary split between surviving in dry environments, and having defense mechanisms against fungal growth, insects, and granivorous mammals. Capsaicin synthesis in chilies places a strain on their water resources. This directly affects their fitness, as it has been observed that standard concentration of capsaicin of peppers in high moisture environments in the seeds and pericarps of the peppers reduced the seeds production by 50%.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Drupes do not split open to release the seed, i.e., they are indehiscent. These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions). \nThe definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, woody (lignified) stone is derived from the ovary wall of the flower. In an aggregate fruit, which is composed of small, individual drupes (such as a raspberry), each individual is termed a drupelet, and may together form an aggregate fruit. Such fruits are often termed \"berries\", although botanists use a different definition of \"berry\". Other fleshy fruits may have a stony enclosure that comes from the seed coat surrounding the seed, but such fruits are not drupes.\nFlowering plants that produce drupes include coffee, jujube, mango, olive, most palms (including a\u00e7a\u00ed, date, sabal and oil palms), pistachio, white sapote, cashew, and all members of the genus \"Prunus\", including the almond, apricot, cherry, damson, peach, nectarine, and plum.\nThe term drupaceous is applied to a fruit having the structure and texture of a drupe, but which does not precisely fit the definition of a drupe.\nDescription.\nThe boundary between a drupe and a berry is not always clear. Thus, some sources describe the fruit of species from the genus \"Persea\", which includes the avocado, as a drupe; others describe the avocado as a berry. One definition of berry requires the endocarp to be less than thick, other fruits with a stony endocarp being drupes. In marginal cases, terms such as \"drupaceous\" or \"drupe-like\" are sometimes used.\nA freestone is a drupe with a stone that can easily be removed from the flesh. A clingstone is a drupe with a stone which cannot easily be removed from the flesh. A tryma is a nut-like drupe. Hickory nuts (\"Carya\") and walnuts (\"Juglans\") in the Juglandaceae family grow within an outer husk; these fruits are technically drupes or drupaceous nuts, not true botanical nuts.\nMany drupes, with their sweet, fleshy outer layer, attract the attention of animals as food, and the plant benefits from the resulting dispersal of its seeds.\nExamples.\nTypical drupes include apricots, olives, loquat, peaches, plums, cherries, mangoes, pecans, and amlas (Indian gooseberries). Other examples include sloe (\"Prunus spinosa\") and ivy (\"Hedera helix\").\nThe coconut is a drupe, its mesocarp a dry or fibrous \"husk\", its endocarp a hard shell. \nBramble fruits such as the blackberry and the raspberry are aggregates of drupelets. The fruit of blackberries and raspberries comes from a single flower whose pistil is made up of a number of free carpels. However, mulberries, which closely resemble blackberries, are not aggregates but multiple fruits.\nSome drupes occur in clusters, as in palms. Examples include dates, \"Jubaea chilensis\" in central Chile and \"Washingtonia filifera\" in the Sonoran Desert of North America.\nMany gymnosperms like cycads, ginkgos and some cypresses have drupe-like \"fruits\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the Supreme Court's first African-American justice. Before his judicial service, he was an attorney who fought for civil rights, leading the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Marshall was a prominent figure in the movement to end racial segregation in American public schools. He won 29 of the 32 civil rights cases he argued before the Supreme Court, culminating in the Court's landmark 1954 decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", which rejected the separate but equal doctrine and held segregation in public education to be unconstitutional. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court in 1967. A staunch liberal, he frequently dissented as the Court became increasingly conservative.\nBorn in Baltimore, Maryland, Marshall attended Lincoln University and the Howard University School of Law. At Howard, he was mentored by Charles Hamilton Houston, who taught his students to be \"social engineers\" willing to use the law to fight for civil rights. Marshall opened a law practice in Baltimore but soon joined Houston at the NAACP in New York. They worked together on the segregation case of \"Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada\"; after Houston returned to Washington, Marshall took his place as special counsel of the NAACP, and he became director-counsel of the newly formed NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He participated in numerous landmark Supreme Court cases involving civil rights, including \"Smith v. Allwright\", \"Morgan v. Virginia\", \"Shelley v. Kraemer\", \"McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents\", \"Sweatt v. Painter\", \"Brown\", and \"Cooper v. Aaron\". His approach to desegregation cases emphasized the use of sociological data to show that segregation was inherently unequal.\nIn 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where he favored a broad interpretation of constitutional protections. Four years later, Johnson appointed him as the U.S. Solicitor General. In 1967, Johnson nominated Marshall to replace Justice Tom C. Clark on the Supreme Court; despite opposition from Southern senators, he was confirmed by a vote of 69 to 11. He was often in the majority during the consistently liberal Warren Court period, but after appointments by President Richard Nixon made the Court more conservative, Marshall frequently found himself in dissent. His closest ally on the Court was Justice William J. Brennan Jr., and the two voted the same way in most cases.\nMarshall's jurisprudence was pragmatic and drew on his real-world experience. His most influential contribution to constitutional doctrine, the \"sliding-scale\" approach to the Equal Protection Clause, called on courts to apply a flexible balancing test instead of a more rigid tier-based analysis. He fervently opposed the death penalty, which in his view constituted cruel and unusual punishment; he and Brennan dissented in more than 1,400 cases in which the majority refused to review a death sentence. He favored a robust interpretation of the First Amendment in decisions such as \"Stanley v. Georgia\", and he supported abortion rights in \"Roe v. Wade\" and other cases. Marshall retired from the Supreme Court in 1991 and was replaced by Clarence Thomas. He died in 1993.\nEarly life and education.\nThoroughgood Marshall was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Norma and William Canfield Marshall. His father held various jobs as a waiter in hotels, in clubs, and on railroad cars, and his mother was an elementary school teacher. The family moved to New York City in search of better employment opportunities not long after Thurgood's birth; they returned to Baltimore when he was six years old.50 He was an energetic and boisterous child who frequently found himself in trouble.37 Following legal cases was one of William's hobbies, and Thurgood oftentimes went to court with him to observe the proceedings.37 Marshall later said that his father \"never told me to become a lawyer, but he turned me into one... He taught me how to argue, challenged my logic on every point, by making me prove every statement I made, even if we were discussing the weather.\"38\nMarshall attended the Colored High and Training School (later Frederick Douglass High School) in Baltimore, graduating in 1925 with honors.34 He then enrolled at Lincoln University in Chester County, Pennsylvania, the oldest college for African Americans in the United States.43 The mischievous Marshall was suspended for two weeks in the wake of a hazing incident, but he earned good grades in his classes and led the school's debating team to numerous victories. His classmates included the poet Langston Hughes.88 Upon his graduation with honors in 1930 with a bachelor's degree in American literature and philosophy,46 Marshall\u2014being unable to attend the all-white University of Maryland Law School\u2014applied to Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C., and was admitted.107 At Howard, he was mentored by Charles Hamilton Houston, who taught his students to be \"social engineers\" willing to use the law as a vehicle to fight for civil rights.561499 Marshall graduated in June 1933 ranked first in his class, and he passed the Maryland bar examination later that year.\nLegal career.\nMarshall started a law practice in Baltimore, but it was not financially successful, partially because he spent much of his time working for the benefit of the community.1499 He volunteered with the Baltimore branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons (NAACP).477 In 1935, Marshall and Houston brought suit against the University of Maryland on behalf of Donald Gaines Murray, an African American whose application to the university's law school had been rejected on account of his race.78 In that case\u2014\"Murray v. Pearson\"\u2014Judge Eugene O'Dunne ordered that Murray be admitted, and the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that it violated equal protection to admit white students to the law school while keeping blacks from being educated in-state. The decision was never appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States and therefore did not apply nationwide, but it pleased Marshall, who later said that he had filed the lawsuit \"to get even with the bastards\" who had kept him from attending the school himself.47\nIn 1936, Marshall joined Houston, who had been appointed as the NAACP's special counsel, in New York City, serving as his assistant.47719 They worked together on the landmark case of \"Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada\" (1938)\".\"477 When Lloyd Lionel Gaines's application to the University of Missouri's law school was rejected on account of his race, he filed suit, arguing that his equal-protection rights had been violated because he had not been provided with a legal education substantially equivalent to that which white students received. After Missouri courts rejected Gaines's claims, Houston\u2014joined by Marshall, who helped to prepare the brief\u2014sought review in the U.S. Supreme Court.9470 They did not challenge the Court's decision in \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" (1896), which had accepted the \"separate but equal\" doctrine; instead, they argued that Gaines had been denied an equal education. In an opinion by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, the Court held that if Missouri gave whites the opportunity to attend law school in-state, it was required to do the same for blacks.70\nHouston returned to Washington in 1938, and Marshall assumed his position as special counsel the following year.26 He also became the director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. (the Inc Fund), which had been established as a separate organization for tax purposes.27 In addition to litigating cases and arguing matters before the Supreme Court, he was responsible for raising money, managing the Inc Fund, and conducting public-relations work.27 Marshall litigated a number of cases involving unequal salaries for African Americans, winning nearly all of them; by 1945, he had ended salary disparities in major Southern cities and earned a reputation as a prominent figure in the civil rights movement.1500 He also defended individuals who had been charged with crimes before both trial courts and the Supreme Court.1500 Of the thirty-two civil rights cases that Marshall argued before the Supreme Court, he won twenty-nine.598 He and W. J. Durham wrote the brief in \"Smith v. Allwright\" (1944), in which the Court ruled the white primary unconstitutional, and he successfully argued both \"Morgan v. Virginia\" (1946), involving segregation on interstate buses, and a companion case to \"Shelley v. Kraemer\" (1948), involving racially restrictive covenants.\nFrom 1939 to 1947, Marshall was a member of the Board of Directors of the American Civil Liberties Union. During that period, he aligned with the faction which favored a more absolutist defense of civil liberties. Most notably, unlike the majority of the Board, he was consistent in his opposition to Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, which put Japanese Americans into concentration camps. Also, in contrast to most of the Board, Marshall charged that the prosecution of thirty-two right wing opponents of Roosevelt's pre-war foreign policy in the Sedition Trial of 1944 violated the First Amendment.\nIn the years after 1945, Marshall resumed his offensive against racial segregation in schools.1501 Together with his Inc Fund colleagues, he devised a strategy that emphasized the inherent educational disparities caused by segregation rather than the physical differences between the schools provided for blacks and whites.1501 The Court ruled in Marshall's favor in \"Sipuel v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma\" (1948), ordering that Oklahoma provide Ada Lois Sipuel with a legal education, although the justices declined to order that she be admitted to the state's law school for whites. In 1950, Marshall brought two cases involving education to the Court: \"McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents\", which was George W. McLaurin's challenge to unequal treatment at the University of Oklahoma's graduate school, and \"Sweatt v. Painter\", which was Heman Sweatt's challenge to his being required to attend a blacks-only law school in Texas. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of both McLaurin and Sweatt on the same day; although the justices did not overrule \"Plessy\" and the separate but equal doctrine, they rejected discrimination against African-American students and the provisions of schools for blacks that were inferior to those provided for whites.\nMarshall next turned to the issue of segregation in primary and secondary schools.478 The NAACP brought suit to challenge segregated schools in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia, arguing both that there were disparities between the physical facilities provided for blacks and whites and that segregation was inherently harmful to African-American children.1502 Marshall helped to try the South Carolina case.1502 He called numerous social scientists and other expert witnesses to testify regarding the harms of segregation; these included the psychology professor Ken Clark, who testified that segregation in schools caused self-hatred among African-American students and inflicted damage that was \"likely to endure as long as the conditions of segregation exist\". The five cases eventually reached the Supreme Court and were argued in December 1952.119 In contrast to the oratorical rhetoric of his adversary\u2014John W. Davis, a former solicitor general and presidential candidate\u2014Marshall spoke plainly and conversationally.1502 He stated that the only possible justification for segregation \"is an inherent determination that the people who were formerly in slavery, regardless of anything else, shall be kept as near that stage as possible. And now is the time, we submit, that this Court should make clear that that is not what our Constitution stands for.\" On May 17, 1954, after internal disagreements and a 1953 reargument, the Supreme Court handed down its unanimous decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", holding in an opinion by Chief Justice Earl Warren that: \"in the field of public education the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\" When Marshall heard Warren read those words, he later said, \"I was so happy I was numb\".226\nThe Court in \"Brown\" ordered additional arguments on the proper remedy for the constitutional violation that it had identified; in \"Brown\" II, decided in 1955, the justices ordered that desegregation proceed \"with all deliberate speed\". Their refusal to set a concrete deadline came as a disappointment to Marshall, who had argued for total integration to be completed by September 1956.237478 In the years following the Court's decision, Marshall coordinated challenges to Virginia's \"massive resistance\" to \"Brown\", and he returned to the Court to successfully argue \"Cooper v. Aaron\" (1958), involving Little Rock's attempt to delay integration.1504 Marshall, who according to the legal scholar Mark Tushnet \"gradually became a civil rights leader more than a civil rights lawyer\", spent substantial amounts of time giving speeches and fundraising;1503 in 1960, he accepted an invitation from Tom Mboya to help draft Kenya's constitution. By that year, Tushnet writes, he had become \"the country's most prominent Supreme Court advocate\".1505\nCourt of Appeals.\nPresident John F. Kennedy, who according to Tushnet \"wanted to demonstrate his commitment to the interests of African Americans without incurring enormous political costs\", nominated Marshall to be a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on September 23, 1961. The Second Circuit, which spanned New York, Vermont, and Connecticut, was at the time the nation's prominent appellate court.10 When Congress adjourned, Kennedy gave Marshall a recess appointment, and he took the oath of office on October 23.10\nEven after his recess appointment, Southern senators continued to delay Marshall's full confirmation for more than eight months. A subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee postponed his hearing several times, leading Senator Kenneth Keating, a New York Republican, to charge that the three-member subcommittee, which included two pro-segregation Southern Democrats, was biased against Marshall and engaged in unjustifiable delay.29810 The subcommittee held several hearings between May and August 1962; Marshall faced harsh questioning from the Southerners over what the scholar Howard Ball described as \"marginal issues at best\".182 After further delays from the subcommittee, the full Judiciary Committee bypassed it and, by an 11\u20134 vote on September 7, endorsed Marshall's nomination.12 Following five hours of floor debate, the full Senate confirmed him by a 56\u201314 vote on September 11, 1962.\nOn the Second Circuit, Marshall authored 98 majority opinions, none of which were reversed by the Supreme Court, as well as 8 concurrences and 12 dissents.216 He dissented when a majority held in the Fourth Amendment case of \"United States ex rel. Angelet v. Fay\" (1964) that the Supreme Court's 1961 decision in \"Mapp v. Ohio\" (which held that the exclusionary rule applied to the states) did not apply retroactively, writing that the judiciary was \"not free to circumscribe the application of a declared constitutional right\".184 In \"United States v. Wilkins\" (1964), he concluded that the Fifth Amendment's protection against double jeopardy applied to the states; in \"People of the State of New York v. Galamison\" (1965), he dissented from a ruling upholding the convictions of civil rights protesters at the New York World's Fair. Marshall's dissents indicated that he favored broader interpretations of constitutional protections than did his colleagues.311\nSolicitor General.\nMarshall's nomination to the office of Solicitor General was widely viewed as a stepping stone to a Supreme Court appointment.19 Johnson pressured Southern senators not to obstruct Marshall's confirmation, and a hearing before a Senate subcommittee lasted only fifteen minutes; the full Senate confirmed him on August 11, 1965.190 As Solicitor General, Marshall won fourteen of the nineteen Supreme Court cases he argued.133 He later characterized the position as \"the most effective job\" and \"maybe the best\" job he ever had.19 Marshall argued in \"Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections\" (1966) that conditioning the ability to vote on the payment of a poll tax was unlawful; in a companion case to \"Miranda v. Arizona\" (1966), he unsuccessfully maintained on behalf of the government that federal agents were not always required to inform arrested individuals of their rights. He defended the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in \"South Carolina v. Katzenbach\" (1966) and \"Katzenbach v. Morgan\" (1966), winning both cases.\nSupreme Court nomination.\nIn February 1967, Johnson nominated Ramsey Clark to be Attorney General.25 The nominee's father was Tom C. Clark, an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.150 Fearing that his son's appointment would create substantial conflicts of interest for him, the elder Clark announced his resignation from the Court.25 For Johnson, who had long desired to nominate a non-white justice, the choice of a nominee to fill the ensuing vacancy \"was as easy as it was obvious\", according to the scholar Henry J. Abraham.219 Although the President briefly considered selecting William H. Hastie (an African-American appellate judge from Philadelphia) or a female candidate, he decided to choose Marshall.25 Johnson announced the nomination in the White House Rose Garden on June 13, declaring that Marshall \"deserves the appointment... I believe that it is the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place.\"15125\nThe public received the nomination favorably, and Marshall was praised by prominent senators from both parties. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings for five days in July.153 Marshall faced harsh criticism from such senators as Mississippi's James O. Eastland, North Carolina's Sam Ervin Jr., Arkansas's John McClellan, and South Carolina's Strom Thurmond, all of whom opposed the nominee's liberal jurisprudence.195 In what \"Time\" magazine characterized as a \"Yahoo-type hazing\", Thurmond asked Marshall over sixty questions about various minor aspects of the history of certain constitutional provisions.196 By an 11\u20135 vote on August 3, the committee recommended that Marshall be confirmed.337 On August 30, after six hours of debate, senators voted 69\u201311 to confirm Marshall to the Supreme Court.197 He took the constitutional oath of office on October 2, 1967, becoming the first African American to serve as a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.338\nSupreme Court.\nMarshall remained on the Supreme Court for nearly twenty-four years, serving until his retirement in 1991.314 The Court to which he was appointed\u2014the Warren Court\u2014had a consistent liberal majority, and Marshall's jurisprudence was similar to that of its leaders, Chief Justice Warren and Justice William J. Brennan Jr.1507 Although he wrote few major opinions during this period due to his lack of seniority, he was typically in the majority.344335 As a result of four Supreme Court appointments by President Richard Nixon, however, the liberal coalition vanished.335 The Court under Chief Justice Warren Burger (the Burger Court) was not as conservative as some observers had anticipated, but the task of constructing liberal majorities case-by-case was left primarily to Brennan; Marshall's most consequential contributions to constitutional law came in dissent.1508 The justice left much of his work to his law clerks, preferring to determine the outcome of the case and then allow the clerks to draft the opinion themselves.215 He took umbrage at frequent claims that he did no work and spent his time watching daytime soap operas;203 according to Tushnet, who clerked for Marshall, the idea that he \"was a lazy Justice uninterested in the Court's work... is wrong and perhaps racist\".2109 Marshall's closest colleague and friend on the Court was Brennan, and the two justices agreed so often that their clerks privately referred to them as \"Justice Brennanmarshall\".10 He also had a high regard for Warren, whom he described as \"probably the greatest Chief Justice who ever lived\".210\nMarshall consistently sided with the Supreme Court's liberal bloc.347 According to the scholar William J. Daniels: \"His approach to justice was Warren Court\u2013style legal realism... In his dissenting opinions he emphasized individual rights, fundamental fairness, equal opportunity and protection under the law, the supremacy of the Constitution as the embodiment of rights and privileges, and the Supreme Court's responsibility to play a significant role in giving meaning to the notion of constitutional rights.\" Marshall's jurisprudence was pragmatic and relied on his real-world experience as a lawyer and as an African American.339 He disagreed with the notion (favored by some of his conservative colleagues) that the Constitution should be interpreted according to the Founders' original understandings;382 in a 1987 speech commemorating the Constitution's bicentennial, he said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... I do not believe that the meaning of the Constitution was forever \"fixed\" at the Philadelphia Convention. Nor do I find the wisdom, foresight, and sense of justice exhibited by the framers particularly profound. To the contrary, the government they devised was defective from the start, requiring several amendments, a civil war, and momentous social transformation to attain the system of constitutional government, and its respect for the individual freedoms and human rights, that we hold as fundamental today... \"We the People\" no longer enslave, but the credit does not belong to the framers. It belongs to those who refused to acquiesce in outdated notions of \"liberty\", \"justice\", and \"equality\", and who strived to better them... I plan to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution as a living document, including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.\nEqual protection and civil rights.\nAs the Court became increasingly conservative, Marshall found himself dissenting in numerous cases regarding racial discrimination.1511 When the majority held in \"Milliken v. Bradley\" that a lower court had gone too far in ordering busing to reduce racial imbalances between schools in Detroit, he dissented, criticizing his colleagues for what he viewed as a lack of resolve to implement desegregation even when faced with difficulties and public resistance. In a dissent in \"City of Memphis v. Greene\" that according to Tushnet \"demonstrated his sense of the practical reality that formed the context for abstract legal issues\", he argued that a street closure that made it more difficult for residents of an African-American neighborhood to reach a city park was unconstitutional because it sent \"a plain and powerful symbolic message\" to blacks \"that because of their race, they are to stay out of the all-white enclave... and should instead take the long way around\". Marshall felt that affirmative action was both necessary and constitutional;257 in an opinion in \"Regents of the University of California v. Bakke\", he commented that it was \"more than a little ironic that, after several hundred years of class-based discrimination against Negroes, the Court is unwilling to hold that a class-based remedy for that discrimination is permissible\".131 Dissenting in \"City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.\", he rejected the majority's decision to strike down an affirmative-action program for government contractors, stating that he did \"not believe that this Nation is anywhere close to eradicating racial discrimination or its vestiges\".\nMarshall's most influential contribution to constitutional doctrine was his \"sliding-scale\" approach to the Equal Protection Clause, which posited that the judiciary should assess a law's constitutionality by balancing its goals against its impact on groups and rights.336 Dissenting in \"Dandridge v. Williams\", a case in which the majority upheld Maryland's $250-a-month cap on welfare payments against claims that it was insufficient for large families, he argued that rational basis review was not appropriate in cases involving \"the literally vital interests of a powerless minority\". In what Cass Sunstein described as the justice's greatest opinion, Marshall dissented when the Court in \"San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez\" upheld a system in which local schools were funded mainly through property taxes, arguing that the policy (which meant that poorer school districts obtained less money than richer ones) resulted in unconstitutional discrimination. His dissent in \"Harris v. McRae\", in which the Court upheld the Hyde Amendment's ban on the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions, rebuked the majority for applying a \"relentlessly formalistic catechism\" that failed to take account of the amendment's \"crushing burden on indigent women\". Although Marshall's sliding-scale approach was never adopted by the Court as a whole, the legal scholar Susan Low Bloch comments that \"his consistent criticism seems to have prodded the Court to somewhat greater flexibility\".527\nCriminal procedure and capital punishment.\nMarshall supported the Warren Court's constitutional decisions on criminal law, and he wrote the opinion of the Court in \"Benton v. Maryland\", which held that the Constitution's prohibition of double jeopardy applied to the states.337 After the retirements of Warren and Justice Hugo Black, however, \"Marshall was continually shocked at the refusal\" of the Burger and Rehnquist Courts \"to hold police and those involved in the criminal justice system responsible for acting according to the language and the spirit of fundamental procedural guarantees\", according to Ball.286 He favored a strict interpretation of the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement and opposed rulings that made exceptions to that provision;112 in \"United States v. Ross\", for instance, he indignantly dissented when the Court upheld a conviction that was based on evidence discovered during a warrantless search of containers that had been found in an automobile. Marshall felt strongly that the \"Miranda\" doctrine should be expanded and fully enforced.112 In cases involving the Sixth Amendment, he argued that defendants must have competent attorneys; dissenting in \"Strickland v. Washington\", Marshall (parting ways with Brennan) rejected the majority's conclusion that defendants must prove prejudice in ineffective assistance of counsel cases.112\nMarshall fervently opposed capital punishment throughout his time on the Court, arguing that it was cruel and unusual and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.318 He was the only justice with considerable experience defending those charged with capital crimes, and he expressed concern about the fact that injustices in death-penalty cases could not be remedied, often commenting: \"Death is so lasting.\" In \"Furman v. Georgia\", a case in which the Court struck down the capital-punishment statutes that were in force at the time, Marshall wrote that the death penalty was \"morally unacceptable to the people of the United States at this time in their history\" and that it \"falls upon the poor, the ignorant, and the underprivileged members of society\".1515 When the Court in \"Gregg v. Georgia\" upheld new death-penalty laws that required juries to consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances, he dissented, describing capital punishment as a \"vestigial savagery\" that was immoral and violative of the Eighth Amendment.305 Afterwards, Marshall and Brennan dissented in every instance in which the Court declined to review a death sentence, filing more than 1,400 dissents that read: \"Adhering to our views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, we would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.\"175\nFirst Amendment.\nAccording to Ball, Marshall felt that the rights protected by the First Amendment were the Constitution's most important principles and that they could be restricted only for extremely compelling reasons.316 In a 1969 opinion in \"Stanley v. Georgia\", he held that it was unconstitutional to criminalize the possession of obscene material.335 For the Court, he reversed the conviction of a Georgia man charged with possessing pornography, writing: \"If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch.\"317 In \"Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 400 v. Logan Valley Plaza\", he wrote for the Court that protesters had the right to picket on private property that was open to the public\u2014a decision that was effectively overruled (over Marshall's dissent) four years later in \"Lloyd Corporation v. Tanner\". He emphasized equality in his free speech opinions, writing in \"Chicago Police Dept. v. Mosley\" that \"above all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its messages, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content\".1513 Making comparisons to earlier civil rights protests, Marshall vigorously dissented in \"Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence\", a case in which the Court ruled that the government could forbid homeless individuals from protesting poverty by sleeping overnight in Lafayette Park; although Burger decried their claims as \"frivolous\" attempts to \"trivialize\" the Constitution, Marshall argued that the protesters were engaged in constitutionally protected symbolic speech.378\nMarshall joined the majority in \"Texas v. Johnson\" and \"United States v. Eichman\", two cases in which the Court held that the First Amendment protected the right to burn the American flag. He favored the total separation of church and state, dissenting when the Court upheld in \"Lynch v. Donnelly\" a city's display of a nativity scene and joining the majority in \"Wallace v. Jaffree\" to strike down an Alabama law regarding prayer in schools. On the issue of the free exercise of religion, Marshall voted with the majority in \"Wisconsin v. Yoder\" to hold that a school attendance law could not be constitutionally applied to the Amish, and he joined Justice Harry Blackmun's dissent when the Court in \"Employment Division v. Smith\" upheld a restriction on religious uses of peyote and curtailed \"Sherbert v. Verner\"'s strict scrutiny standard. In the view of J. Clay Smith Jr. and Scott Burrell, the justice was \"an unyielding supporter of civil liberties\", whose \"commitment to the values of the First Amendment was enhanced from actually realizing the historical consequences of being on the weaker and poorer side of power\".477\nPrivacy.\nIn Marshall's view, the Constitution guaranteed to all citizens the right to privacy; he felt that although the Constitution nowhere mentioned such a right expressly, it could be inferred from various provisions of the Bill of Rights.356 He joined the majority in \"Eisenstadt v. Baird\" to strike down a statute that prohibited the distribution or sale of contraceptives to unmarried persons, dissented when the Court in \"Bowers v. Hardwick\" upheld an anti-sodomy law, and dissented from the majority's decision in \"Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health\" that the Constitution did not protect an unconditional right to die. On the issue of abortion rights, the author Carl T. Rowan comments that \"no justice ever supported a woman's right to choice as uncompromisingly as Marshall did\".323 He joined Blackmun's opinion for the Court in \"Roe v. Wade\", which held that the Constitution protected a woman's right to have an abortion,342 and he consistently voted against state laws that sought to limit that right in cases such as \"Maher v. Roe\", \"H. L. v. Matheson\", \"Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health\", \"Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists\", and \"Webster v. Reproductive Health Services\".203\nOther topics.\nDuring his service on the Supreme Court, Marshall participated in over 3,400 cases and authored 322 majority opinions.401 He was a member of the unanimous majority in \"United States v. Nixon\" that rejected President Nixon's claims of absolute executive privilege.78 Marshall wrote several influential decisions in the fields of corporate law and securities law, including a frequently-cited opinion regarding materiality in \"TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.\"25 His opinions involving personal jurisdiction, such as \"Shaffer v. Heitner\", were pragmatic and de-emphasized the importance of state boundaries.1514 According to Tushnet, Marshall was \"the Court's liberal specialist in Native American law\"; he endeavored to protect Native Americans from regulatory action on the part of the states.338 He favored a rigid interpretation of procedural requirements, saying in one case that \"rules mean what they say\"\u2014a position that in Tushnet's view was motivated by the justice's \"traditionalist streak\".\nLike most Supreme Court justices, many of Marshall's law clerks went on to become prominent lawyers and legal scholars. His clerks included future Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan, U.S. circuit judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, and legal scholars Cass Sunstein, Mark Tushnet, and Martha Minow.\nPersonal life.\nMarshall wed Vivian \"Buster\" Burey on September 4, 1929, while he was a student at Lincoln University. They remained married until her death from cancer in 1955.180 Marshall married Cecilia \"Cissy\" Suyat, an NAACP secretary, eleven months later; they had two children: Thurgood Jr. and John. Thurgood Jr. became an attorney and worked in the Clinton administration, and John directed the U.S. Marshals Service and served as Virginia's secretary of public safety.\nMarshall was an active member of the Episcopal Church and served as a delegate to its 1964 convention, walking out after a resolution to recognize a right to disobey immoral segregation laws was voted down.180 He was a Prince Hall Mason, attending meetings and participating in rituals.180 He refused to attend the Supreme Court's annual Christmas party believing that it infringed upon the separation of church and state.\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor, who served with Marshall on the Supreme Court for a decade, wrote that \"it was rare during our conference deliberations that he would not share an anecdote, a joke or a story\"; although O'Connor initially treated the stories as \"welcome diversions\", she later \"realized that behind most of the anecdotes was a relevant legal point\".1217\u20131218\nRetirement, later life, and death.\nMarshall did not wish to retire\u2014he frequently said \"I was appointed to a life term, and I intend to serve it\"\u2014but he had been in ill health for many years, and Brennan's retirement in 1990 left him unhappy and isolated on the Court. The 82-year-old justice announced on June 27, 1991, that he would retire.480 When asked at a press conference what was wrong with him that would cause him to leave the Court, he replied: \"What's \"wrong\" with me? I'm old. I'm getting old and coming apart!\"379\nPresident George H. W. Bush (whom Marshall loathed) nominated Clarence Thomas, a rightist who had served in the Reagan and Bush administrations, to replace Marshall.379 His retirement took effect on October 1.951\nMarshall served as a visiting judge on the Second Circuit for a week in January 1992, and he received the American Bar Association's highest award in August of that year. His health continued to deteriorate, and, on January 24, 1993, at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center, he died of heart failure.395159 He was 84 years old.396\nMarshall lay in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court,159 and thousands thronged there to pay their respects;480 more than four thousand attended his funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral.397 The civil rights leader Vernon E. Jordan said that Marshall had \"demonstrat[ed] that the law could be an instrument of liberation\", while Chief Justice William Rehnquist gave a eulogy in which he said: \"Inscribed above the front entrance to the Supreme Court building are the words 'Equal justice under law'. Surely no one individual did more to make these words a reality than Thurgood Marshall.\" Marshall was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.398\nAppraisal and legacy.\nAccording to the scholar Daniel Moak, Marshall \"profoundly shaped the political direction of the United States\", \"transformed constitutional law\", and \"opened up new facets of citizenship to black Americans\".411 For Tushnet, he was \"probably the most important American lawyer of the twentieth century\";1498 in the view of the political scientist Robert C. Smith, he was \"one of the greatest leaders in the history of the African-American struggle for freedom and equality\".218 A 1999 survey of black political scientists listed Marshall as one of the ten greatest African-American leaders in history; panelists described him as the \"greatest jurist of the twentieth century\" and stated that he \"spearheaded the creation of the legal foundations of the civil rights movement\". Scholars of the Supreme Court have not rated Marshall as highly as some of his colleagues: although his pre\u2013Supreme Court legal career and his staunch liberalism have met with broad approval, a perception that he lacked substantial influence over his fellow justices has harmed his reputation. In Abraham's view, \"he was one of America's greatest public lawyers, but he was not a great Supreme Court justice\".222 A 1993 survey of legal scholars found that Marshall was ranked as the seventeenth-greatest justice of the Supreme Court\u2014a rating that, while still lower than that of his fellow liberal justices, was substantially higher than was recorded in an earlier survey.408\nMarshall has received numerous tributes.20 The state of Maryland renamed Baltimore's airport the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport in 2005, and the University of Maryland's law library is named in his honor.20617 Buildings named for Marshall include New York's 590-foot-high Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse (renamed in 2001), where he heard cases as an appellate judge, and the federal judicial center in Washington. He is the namesake of streets and schools throughout the nation, including notably Thurgood Marshall College at the University of California, San Diego.20 Marshall posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1993,253 and the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp in his honor in 2003. He was depicted by Sidney Poitier in the 1991 television movie \"Separate but Equal\",335 by Laurence Fishburne in George Stevens Jr.'s Broadway play \"Thurgood\", and by Chadwick Boseman in the 2017 film \"Marshall\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57447", "revid": "50916781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57447", "title": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "text": "Most populous city in North Carolina, United States\nCharlotte is the most populous city in the U.S. state of North Carolina. With a population of 874,579 at the 2020 census, it is the 14th-most populous city in the U.S., seventh-most populous city in the South, and second-most populous city in the Southeast (after Jacksonville, Florida). The Charlotte metropolitan area, with an estimated 2.88 million residents, is the 21st-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. The Charlotte metropolitan area is part of an 18-county combined statistical area with an estimated population of 3.47 million as of 2024. It is the county seat of Mecklenburg County.\nBetween 2004 and 2014, Charlotte was among the country's fastest-growing metropolitan areas, with 888,000 new residents. Based on U.S. census data from 2005 to 2015, Charlotte tops the U.S. in millennial population growth. Throughout the 2020s, it has remained one of the fastest-growing major cities in the United States. Residents of Charlotte are referred to as \"Charlotteans\".\nCharlotte is home to the corporate headquarters of Bank of America, Honeywell, Truist Financial, and the East Coast headquarters of Wells Fargo, which, when combined with other Charlotte-based financial institutions, makes the city the second-largest banking center in the nation.\nCharlotte's notable attractions include three professional sports teams, the Carolina Panthers of the NFL, the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA, and Charlotte FC of MLS. The city is also home to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, Opera Carolina, Charlotte Symphony, Charlotte Ballet, Children's Theatre of Charlotte, Mint Museum, Harvey B. Gantt Center, Bechtler Museum of Modern Art, the Billy Graham Library, Levine Museum of the New South, Charlotte Museum of History, Carowinds amusement park, and U.S. National Whitewater Center.\nCharlotte has a humid subtropical climate. It is located several miles east of the Catawba River and southeast of Lake Norman, the largest human-made lake in North Carolina. Lake Wylie and Mountain Island Lake are two smaller human-made lakes located near the city. As of 2024, 66% of the city's area is occupied by green spaces. The city ranks as the greenest in North America and 28th in the world.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Catawba Indians were the first known historic tribe to settle Mecklenburg County in the Charlotte area and were first recorded around 1567, according to Spanish records.\n18th century.\nThe area that is now Charlotte was first settled by European colonists around 1755 when Thomas Spratt and his family settled near what is now the Elizabeth neighborhood. Thomas Polk (great-uncle of President James K. Polk), who later married Thomas Spratt's daughter, built his house by the intersection of two Native American trading paths between the Yadkin and Catawba rivers. One path ran north\u2013south and was part of the Great Wagon Road; the second path ran east\u2013west along what is now Trade Street.\nBy 1759, half the Catawba tribe had died from smallpox, an endemic disease among European colonists, which the Catawba had no natural immunity against. At the time of their largest population, the Catawba population was 10,000. But by 1826, the Catawba population dropped to 110.\nThe city of Charlotte was developed first by a wave of migration of Scots-Irish Presbyterians, or Ulster-Scot settlers from Ulster, who dominated the culture of the Southern Piedmont Region and made up the principal founding population in the backcountry. German immigrants also settled in the area before the American Revolutionary War, but in smaller numbers. They still contributed greatly to the early foundations of the region.\nMecklenburg County was initially part of Bath County (1696 to 1729) of the New Hanover Precinct, which became New Hanover County in 1729. The western portion of New Hanover split into Bladen County in 1734, and its western portion split into Anson County in 1750. Mecklenburg County was formed from Anson County in 1762. Further apportionment was made in 1792, after the American Revolutionary War, with Cabarrus County formed from Mecklenburg.\nNicknamed the \"Queen City\", like its county a few years earlier, Charlotte was named in honor of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who had become the queen consort of Great Britain and Ireland in 1761, seven years before the town's incorporation. A second nickname derives from the American Revolutionary War, when British commander General Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis occupied the city but was driven out by hostile residents. He wrote that Charlotte was \"a hornet's nest of rebellion\", leading to the historical nickname \"The Hornet's Nest\".\nWithin decades of Polk's settling, the area grew to become the Town of Charlotte, incorporated in 1768. Though chartered as Charlotte, the name appears as a form of \"Charlottesburgh\" on many maps until around 1800. A form of \"Charlottetown\" also appears on maps of British origin depicting General Cornwallis' route of invasion. The crossroads in Piedmont became the heart of Uptown Charlotte. In 1770, surveyors marked the streets in a grid pattern for future development. The east\u2013west trading path became Trade Street, and the Great Wagon Road became Tryon Street, in honor of William Tryon, a royal governor of colonial North Carolina.\nThe intersection of Trade and Tryon is commonly known today as \"Trade and Tryon\", or simply \"The Square\", and formally as \"Independence Square\".\nWhile surveying the boundary between the Carolinas in 1772, William Moultrie stopped in Charlotte, whose five or six houses were \"very ordinary built of logs\".\nLocal leaders came together in 1775 and signed the Mecklenburg Resolves, more popularly known as the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. While not a true declaration of independence from British rule, it is among the first such declarations that eventually led to the American Revolution. May 20, the traditional date of the signing of the declaration, is celebrated annually in Charlotte as \"MecDec\", with musket and cannon fire by reenactors in Independence Square. North Carolina's state flag and state seal also bear the date.\nIn 1799, in nearby Cabarrus County, 12-year-old Conrad Reed found a 17- pound rock, which his family used as a doorstop. Three years later, a jeweler determined it was nearly solid gold, paying the family a paltry $3.50. The first documented gold find in the United States of any consequence set off the nation's first gold rush. Many veins of gold were found in the area throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the 1837 founding of the Charlotte Mint. North Carolina was the chief producer of gold in the United States, until the Sierra Nevada was found in 1848, although the volume mined in the Charlotte area was dwarfed by subsequent rushes.\n19th century.\nIn 1842, Union County formed from Mecklenburg's southeastern portion and a western portion of Anson County. These areas were all part of one of the original six judicial/military districts of North Carolina known as the Salisbury District.\nCharlotte is traditionally considered the home of Southern Presbyterianism, but in the 19th\u00a0century, numerous churches, including Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic formed, eventually giving Charlotte the nickname, \"The City of Churches\".\nSome groups still pan for gold occasionally in local streams and creeks. The Reed Gold Mine operated until 1912. The Charlotte Mint was active until 1861 when Confederate forces seized it at the outbreak of the Civil War. The mint was not reopened at the war's end, but the building, albeit in a different location, now houses the Mint Museum of Art.\nThe city's first boom came after the Civil War, as Charlotte became a cotton processing center and railroad hub. By the 1880s, Charlotte sat astride the Southern Railway mainline from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. Farmers from miles around would bring cotton to the railroad platform in Uptown. Local promotors began building textile factories, starting with the 1881 Charlotte Cotton Mill that still stands at Graham and 5th streets.\nCharlotte's city population at the 1890 census grew to 11,557.\n20th century.\nIn 1910, Charlotte surpassed Wilmington to become North Carolina's largest city with 34,014 residents.\nThe population grew again during World War I, when the U.S. government established Camp Greene, north of present-day Wilkinson Boulevard. The camp supported 40,000 soldiers, with many troops and suppliers staying after the war, launching urbanization that eventually overtook older cities along the Piedmont Crescent. In the 1920 census, Charlotte fell to being the state's second largest city, Winston-Salem with 48,395 people, had two thousand more people than Charlotte. Charlotte would pass Winston-Salem in population by the 1930 census, and has remained North Carolina's largest city since.\nUntil 1958, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad operated a daily passenger train from its own station (which had opened in 1896) to Wilmington.\nThe city's modern-day banking industry achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, largely under the leadership of financier Hugh McColl. McColl transformed North Carolina National Bank (NCNB) into a formidable national bank that through aggressive acquisitions eventually merged with BankAmerica to become Bank of America. First Union, later Wachovia in 2001, experienced similar growth before it was acquired by San Francisco\u2013based Wells Fargo in 2008. Measured by control of assets, Charlotte became the second largest banking headquarters in the United States after New York City.\nOn September 22, 1989, the city was hit by Hurricane Hugo. With sustained winds of and gusts of , Hugo caused massive property damage, destroyed 80,000 trees, and knocked out electrical power to most of the population. Residents were without power for weeks, schools were closed for a week or more, and the cleanup took months. The city was caught unprepared; Charlotte is inland, and residents from coastal areas in both Carolinas often wait out hurricanes in Charlotte.\n21st century.\nIn December 2002, Charlotte and much of central North Carolina were hit by an ice storm that resulted in more than 1.3\u00a0million people losing power. During an abnormally cold December, many were without power for weeks. Many of the city's Bradford pear trees split apart under the weight of the ice.\nIn August 2015 and September 2016, the city experienced several days of protests related to the police shootings of Jonathan Ferrell and Keith Scott.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.63%) is water. Charlotte is the twenty-sixth-most expansive city in the United States and lies at an elevation of . Charlotte constitutes most of Mecklenburg County in the Carolina Piedmont. Uptown Charlotte sits atop a long rise between two creeks, Sugar Creek and Irwin Creek, and was built on the gunnies of the St. Catherine's and Rudisill gold mines. Charlotte is southwest of Concord; northeast of Rock Hill, South Carolina; southwest of Greensboro; west of Fayetteville; and southwest of Raleigh, the state capital.\nThough the Catawba River and its lakes lie several miles west, there are no significant bodies of water or other geological features near the city center. Consequently, development has neither been constrained nor helped by waterways or ports that have contributed to many cities of similar size. The lack of these obstructions has contributed to Charlotte's growth as a highway, rail, and air transportation hub.\nNeighborhoods.\n \nCharlotte has 199 neighborhoods radiating in all directions from Uptown. Biddleville, the primary historic center of Charlotte's African American community, is west of Uptown, starting at the Johnson C. Smith University campus and extending to the airport. East of The Plaza and north of Central Avenue, Plaza Midwood is known for its international population, including Eastern Europeans, Greeks, Middle-Easterners, and Hispanics. North Tryon and the Sugar Creek area include several Asian American communities. NoDa (North Davidson), north of Uptown, is an emerging center for arts and entertainment. Myers Park, Dilworth, and Eastover are home to some of Charlotte's most affluent, oldest and largest houses, on tree-lined boulevards, with Freedom Park nearby.\nThe SouthPark area offers shopping, dining, and multifamily housing. Far South Boulevard is home to a large Hispanic community. Many students, researchers, and affiliated professionals live near UNC\u00a0Charlotte in the northeast area known as University City.\nThe large area known as Southeast Charlotte is home to many golf communities, luxury developments, churches, the Jewish community center, and private schools. As undeveloped land within Mecklenburg has become scarce, many of these communities have expanded into Weddington and Waxhaw in Union County. Ballantyne, in the south of Charlotte, and nearly every area on the I\u2011485 perimeter, has experienced rapid growth over the past ten years. The Steele Creek neighborhood which is primarily in Mecklenburg county is located within minutes near Uptown Charlotte.\nSince the 1980s in particular, Uptown Charlotte has undergone massive construction of buildings, housing Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Hearst Corporation, and Duke Energy, several hotels, and multiple condominium developments.\nParks and green space.\nLatta Park was created in 1891 as an amusement park.\nBryant Park was established in the 1930s and is one of the earliest small-scale public parks in Charlotte. It is the only green space remaining in West Morehead Street's industrial sector.\nThe Park Road Park is a prominent landmark near the SouthPark area. Park Road Park features eight basketball courts, two horseshoe pits, six baseball fields, five picnic shelters, volleyball courts, playgrounds, trails, tennis courts, and an lake. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Parks &amp; Recreation Department operates 36 tennis facilities and the 12 lighted tennis courts at the park. In September 2013, the Romare Bearden Park opened to the public.\nThe urban section of Little Sugar Creek Greenway was completed in 2012. Inspired in part by the San Antonio River Walk, and integral to Charlotte's extensive urban park system, it is \"a huge milestone\" according to Gwen Cook, greenway planner for Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation. However, the Little Sugar Creek Greenway bears no relation to the San Antonio River Walk.\nThe city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County began purchasing flood-prone homes in the 1990s. Voluntary buyouts of 700 households have created around s of open land that can flood safely, thereby saving an estimated $28 million in flood damage and emergency rescues.\nMcAlpine Creek Park and integrated McAlpine Creek Greenway constructed in 1978 was the first greenway built in the western piedmont of North Carolina.\nClimate.\nLike much of the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States, Charlotte has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\"), with four distinct seasons. Charlotte is part of USDA hardiness zone 8a, transitioning to 7b in the suburbs in all directions except the south. The following narrative reflects 1991\u20132020 climate data. Winters are short and fairly mild, with a normal January daily mean temperature of . On occasion the temperature can fall below , but Charlotte also enjoys multiple warm winter days in excess of . On average, there are 59 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 1.5 days that fail to rise above freezing.\nPrecipitation is evenly distributed through the year. Only August stands out as a slightly wetter month, averaging 4.35 inches of rainfall. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of . Hot and humid days can arrive as early as May and last until the end of September. There is an average of 44 days per year with highs at or above . Official record temperatures range from recorded six times on 6 September 1954, 9\u201310 August 2007 and June 29 to July 1, 2012, down to recorded on December 30, 1880, February 14, 1899 and January 21, 1985. The record cold daily maximum is on February 12 and 13, 1899. The record warm daily minimum is on August 13, 1881. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 5 to March 30, allowing a growing season of 220 days.\nCharlotte is directly in the path of subtropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico as it heads up the eastern seaboard, thus the city receives ample precipitation throughout the year but also many clear, sunny days. Precipitation is generally less frequent in autumn than in spring. On average, Charlotte receives of precipitation annually, evenly distributed throughout the year. Annual precipitation has historically ranged from in 2001 to in 1884.\nThere is an average of of snow, mainly in January and February and rarely December or March, with more frequent ice storms and sleet mixed in with rain. Seasonal snowfall has historically ranged from no snowfall in 2022-23 and 2023-24 to in 1959\u201360. Snow and ice storms can have a major impact on the area, as they often pull tree limbs down onto power lines and make driving hazardous. Snow has been recorded a small number of times in April, most recently on April 2, 2019.\nAs of 2020[ [update]], the Charlotte metropolitan area as a whole is noted for having one of the worst weather radar gaps among any major U.S. East Coast city, with little to no coverage in a roughly quadrilateral area spanning Concord, Salisbury and much \nof Statesville. As the nearest NWS-owned NEXRAD is located in Greer, South Carolina, more than to the west-southwest of Charlotte, this deficit is particularly problematic during severe thunderstorm or tornado episodes. The current lowest angle of the radar, based in Greer, is quite far above the surface over Charlotte, so the velocities measurement for detecting rotations cannot be below mid-level in potential tornado-forming storms and thus cannot indicate whether said rotation extends closer to the ground (below ).\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the 2020 census, there were 874,579 people, 342,448 households, and 195,614 families living in the city. In 2019, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates showed 885,708 residents living within Charlotte's city limits and 1,093,901 in Mecklenburg County. The combined statistical area, or trade area, of Charlotte\u2013Concord\u2013Gastonia, NC\u2013SC had an estimated population of 3,387,115 in 2023.

The Blue Line is an 18.9\u2011mile line north\u2013south light rail line running through South End, Center City, NoDa, and University City. The CityLYNX Gold Line streetcar, Phase 1 of which opened in 2015, is under Phase 2 construction as of fall 2020. When completed, the Gold Line will link the Beatties Ford neighborhood through Uptown and then south and east to the Elizabeth neighborhood. The LYNX Silver Line, a light rail line in the pre-project development phase as of fall 2020, will link the southeastern suburbs of Matthews, Stallings, and Indian Trail with Uptown Charlotte and the future Charlotte Gateway Station before extending west to Charlotte Douglas International Airport and across the Catawba River to Belmont in Gaston County.\nThe bulk of CATS ridership is derived from its extensive bus network, which has its main hub at the Charlotte Transportation Center in Uptown, which also connects to the Blue and Gold lines. Other bus hubs are located at community transit centers in SouthPark, Eastland, and at Rosa Parks Place. CATS operates express buses to outlying parts of the city and some commuter bus to the northern suburbs in the Lake Norman area under the MetroRAPID umbrella.\nWalkability.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Charlotte the 49th most walkable of the 50 largest cities in the United States.\nRoads and highways.\nCharlotte's central location between the population centers of the Northeast and Southeast has made it a transportation focal point and primary distribution center, with two major interstate highways, I-85 and I-77, intersecting near the city's center. The latter highway also connects to the population centers of the Rust Belt.\nCharlotte's beltway, designated I-485 and simply called \"485\" by local residents, was under construction for over 20 years, but funding problems slowed its progress. The final segment was finished in mid-2015. I-485 has a total circumference of approximately . Within the city, the I-277 loop freeway encircles Charlotte's uptown (usually referred to by its two separate sections, the John Belk Freeway and the Brookshire Freeway) while Charlotte Route 4 links major roads in a loop between I-277 and I-485. Independence Freeway, which carries U.S. 74 and links downtown with the Matthews area, is undergoing an expansion and widening in the eastern part of the city.\nAir.\nIn 2011, Charlotte Douglas International Airport was the sixth-busiest airport in both the U.S. and the world overall as measured by traffic (aircraft movements). The airport handled just over 50 million travellers in 2019, as well as many domestic and international carriers including Air Canada, Lufthansa, and Volaris. It is a major hub for American Airlines, having historically been a hub for its predecessors US Airways and Piedmont Airlines. Nonstop flights are available to many destinations across the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, Europe, Mexico, and South America. The 145th Airlift Wing of North Carolina Air National Guard is also located east of the airport.\nIntercity transportation.\nCharlotte is served daily by three Amtrak routes with ten daily trips from a station on North Tryon Street, just outside downtown.\nCharlotte is also served by both Greyhound and low-cost curbside carrier Megabus. Charlotte is a service stop for Greyhound routes running to Atlanta, Detroit, Jacksonville, New York and Philadelphia. It is also a stop for buses running out of Megabus' hub in Atlanta, with connections to Megabus' northeastern routes out of New York.\nThe city is planning a new centralized downtown multimodal station called Gateway Station. It is expected to house Amtrak, Greyhound and the future LYNX Red Line. It is under construction at the former site of the Greyhound station; Greyhound is currently operating from a temporary station nearby.\nSister cities.\nCharlotte's sister cities are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57448", "revid": "49920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57448", "title": "Tapioca", "text": "Starch extracted from cassava roots\nTapioca (; ) is a starch extracted from the tubers of the cassava plant (\"Manihot esculenta,\" also known as manioc), a species native to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, but which is now found in West Africa, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere. It is a perennial shrub adapted to the hot conditions of tropical lowlands. Cassava copes better with poor soils than many other food plants.\nTapioca is a staple food for millions of people in tropical countries. It provides only carbohydrate food value, and is low in protein, vitamins, and minerals. In other countries, it is used as a thickening agent in various manufactured foods.\nEtymology.\n\"Tapioca\" is derived from the word \"tipi'\u00f3ka\", its name in the Tupi language spoken by natives when the Portuguese first arrived in the Northeast Region of Brazil around 1500. This Tupi word is translated as 'sediment' or 'coagulant' and refers to the curd-like starch sediment that is obtained in the extraction process.\nProduction.\nEstablishment.\nThe cassava plant is easily established by cutting, according to the NRCS \"Propagate cassava by planting segments of the stem. Cut stems into 9-30 cm lengths; be sure to include at least one node. Segments can be buried vertically with 8-15 cm in the ground. The selection of healthy, pest-free cuttings is essential. Stem cuttings are sometimes referred to as 'stakes'. In areas where freezing temperatures are possible, plant cuttings as soon as the danger of frost has past. Cuttings can be planted by hand or by planting machines. Hand planting is done in one of three ways: vertical, flat below the soil surface or tilted. Under low rainfall conditions, vertical planting may result in the desiccation of the cuttings, while in areas of higher rainfall; flat-planted cuttings may rot. In general, flat planting 5-10 cm below the soil surface is recommended in dry climates and when mechanical planting is used. Germination seems to be higher; tubers tend to originate from a great number of points and grow closer to the surface of the soil, making better use of fertilizers applied on the surface and also making harvesting easier.\"\nThe cassava plant can also be established from seed, although this is not advised as seed germination rate is usually less than 50 percent. Because of this, seedlings are normally only used for breeding.\nManagement.\nCassava cuttings start growing roots within just a few days, and new shoots sprout from where the old leaves were attached to the stem. At first, growth is slow, so it\u2019s important to keep weeds under control during the early months.\nCassava grows best in light sandy loam or loamy sand soils that are deep, fertile, and retain moisture. It can also be cultivated successfully in a wide range of soils, from sandy to clayey textures, and in areas with relatively low soil fertility. Cassava is capable of producing economic yields on land that has been depleted by repeated cultivation and is unsuitable for most other crops. The crop generally performs well as long as the soil is friable enough to allow the tubers to expand properly.\nWhen cassava is cultivated on newly cleared forest land, little preparation beyond clearing existing vegetation is required. When grown after other crops, cassava can often be planted immediately following harvest, although in some cases, the soil is plowed two or three times to remove grass and weeds.\nFertilization is generally unnecessary on newly cleared land or when sufficient land is available for rotational cultivation. However, cassava is a fast-growing crop that depletes soil nutrients rapidly. Continuous cultivation without nutrient replacement can result in declining soil fertility. Commercial producers often restore soil nutrients through the application of synthetic fertilizers, while smallholder farmers commonly use organic manures such as cattle dung, duck manure, or composted household waste to maintain soil productivity.\nHarvest.\nCassava does not have a clearly defined stage of maturity and can be harvested whenever the storage roots reach a desirable size for consumption or processing. For food use, harvesting generally occurs between 8 and 12 months after planting. In most tropical regions, cassava can be harvested about eight months after planting, though under less favorable conditions, such as cooler or drier climates, it may take 18 months or more to reach harvestable size. Cassava plants may remain unharvested for more than one growing season, allowing the roots to enlarge further; however, older roots often become fibrous and woody, reducing their edibility and starch content.\nHarvesting is usually performed manually by loosening the soil and pulling up the roots, although mechanical harvesting may be used in commercial operations. Under optimal conditions, yields of fresh roots can reach up to 90 tonnes per hectare, while global averages, largely from smallholder systems, are around 10 tonnes per hectare.\nPreparation.\nThe cassava plant has either red or green branches with blue spindles on them. The root of the green-branched variant requires treatment to remove linamarin, a cyanogenic glycoside occurring naturally in the plant, which otherwise may be converted into cyanide. Konzo (also called mantakassa) is a paralytic disease associated with several weeks of almost exclusive consumption of insufficiently processed bitter cassava.\nIn Brazil's north and northeast, traditional community-based tapioca production is a byproduct of manioc flour production from cassava roots. In this process, the manioc (after treatment to remove toxicity) is ground to a pulp with a small hand- or diesel-powered mill. This masa is then squeezed to dry it out. The wet masa is placed in a long woven tube called a . The top of the tube is secured while a large branch or lever is inserted into a loop at the bottom and used to stretch the entire implement vertically, squeezing a starch-rich liquid out through the weave and ends. This liquid is collected, and the microscopic starch grains in it are allowed to settle into the bottom of the container. The supernatant liquid is then poured off, leaving behind a wet starch sediment that needs to be dried and results in the fine-grained tapioca starch powder similar in appearance to corn starch.\nCommercially, the starch is processed into several forms: hot soluble powder, meal, pre-cooked fine or coarse flakes, rectangular sticks, and spherical \"pearls.\" Pearls are the most widely available shape; sizes range from about 1\u00a0mm to 8\u00a0mm in diameter, with 2\u20133\u00a0mm being the most common.\nFlakes, sticks, and pearls must be soaked well before cooking to rehydrate, absorbing water up to twice their volume. After rehydration, tapioca products become leathery and swollen. Processed tapioca is usually white, but sticks and pearls may be colored. Traditionally, the most common color applied to tapioca has been brown, but recently pastel colors have been available. Tapioca pearls are generally opaque when raw but become translucent when cooked in boiling water.\nBrazil, Thailand, and Nigeria are the world's largest cassava producers. Currently, Thailand accounts for about 60 percent of worldwide exports.\nStorage.\nWhen roots are sold to processing factories, they must be processed within 24 hours of harvest to ensure raw material freshness and prevent microflora growth. This would be observed as brown-black discolorations in a freshly broken root.\nAll process water streams contain some amount of sulfur dioxide to control the growth of microbes. Dried starch provides a shelf-stable product. For example, uncooked, dried tapioca pearls have at least a 2-year shelf life stability, whereas freshly cooked pearls may last ten days in the refrigerator.\u00a0This difference is accounted to the water activity difference between the dried and wet product, the latter introducing a much more favorable condition for microbes to grow.\nEnvironmental issues.\nThere is an issue with tapioca because a large amount of water is needed in order to produce it. One factory reports that it uses around 60 m3 for one ton of tapioca starch just in the first step of processing. With this much water being used, properly disposing of the wastewater is a priority. Cassava contains cyanide, and depending on whether the tapioca is made for human consumption or industrial purposes there will be less or more cyanide. The wastewater used to process the tapioca contains this cyanide and if the wastewater is leaked into bodies of water containing aquatic life, due to the contaminated water's low pH, there is a direct effect on fish and possibly other animals that live on the shores of the polluted water. Water pollution from tapioca manufacturing has been a problem in many countries in Southeast Asia.\nA typical Indonesian tapioca factory in 2011 produces wastewater with three times the allowed amount of cyanides. The bigger issues relative to regulatory limits are the total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand values. As a result, the main proposed treatment methods include anaerobic digestion (producing methane-rich biogas), as fertilizer, and possible future reuse of the starch within. (An aerobic treatment system has been successful run in Thailand in 2004.) As of 2023, the technology to recycle the suspended starch granules in tapioca starch wastewater has become mature enough under the name of \"liquid sugar\". It is expected to create more money-value compared to biogas.\nUses.\nNutrition.\nDried tapioca pearls are 11% water and 89% carbohydrates, with no protein or fat. In a 100-gram reference amount, dried tapioca supplies 358 calories and no or only trace amounts of dietary minerals and vitamins.\nFlatbreads.\nA casabe is a thin flatbread made from bitter cassava root without leavening. It was originally produced by the indigenous Arawak and Carib peoples because these roots were a common plant of the rain forests where they lived. In eastern Venezuela, many indigenous groups still make \"casabe\". It is their chief bread-like staple. Indigenous communities, such as the Ye-Kuana, Kari-\u00d1a, Yanomami, Guarao or Warao descended from the Caribe or Arawac nations, still make \"casabe\".\nTo make \"casabe\", the starchy root of bitter cassava is ground to a pulp, then squeezed to expel a milky, bitter liquid called \"yare\". This carries the poisonous substances with it out of the pulp. Traditionally, this squeezing is done in a \"sebucan\", an 8 to long, tube-shaped, pressure strainer, woven in a characteristic helical pattern from palm leaves. The \"sebucan\" usually is hung from a tree branch or ceiling pole, and it has a closed bottom with a loop that is attached to a fixed stick or lever, which is used to stretch the sebucan. When the lever is pushed down, stretching the sebucan, the helical weaving pattern causes the strainer to squeeze the pulp inside. This is similar to the action of a Chinese finger trap. The pulp is spread in thin, round cakes about in diameter on a \"budare\" to roast or toast.\nThin and crisp cakes of \"casabe\" are often broken apart and eaten like crackers. Like bread, \"casabe\" can be eaten alone or with other dishes. Thicker \"casabe\" usually are eaten slightly moistened. A sprinkle of a few drops of liquid is enough to transform a dry \"casabe\" into soft, smooth bread.\nTapioca pearls.\nTapioca pearls, also known as \"boba\" in East Asia, are produced by passing the moist starch through a sieve under pressure. Pearl tapioca is a common ingredient in Asian desserts such as falooda, kolak, sago soup, and in sweet drinks such as bubble tea, fruit slush and taho, where they provide a chewy contrast to the sweetness and smooth texture of the drink. Small pearls are preferred for use in puddings. Large pearls are preferred for use in drinks. These pearls most often are brown, not white, due to the sugar added and are traditionally used in black or green tea drinks. They are used as various colors in shave ice and hot drinks. In addition to their use in puddings and beverages, tapioca pearls may be used in cakes.\nThe pearls are known as \"s\u0101bud\u0101n\u0101\" in the Indian subcontinent; they are used for sweet and savory dishes, such as sabudana khichri. In Brazil, the pearls are cooked with wine or other liquid to add flavor and are called \"sagu\".\nProcessing and properties.\nProcessing of the cassava flour into tapioca pearls requires the intermediate step of a product called tapioca grit. Tapioca grit is dried cassava flour that is partially gelatinized so that it looks like flakes or irregularly-shaped granules.\nIn contrast, making starch pearls uses a different process of roasting. To form the pearls, the tapioca grit can be cut or extruded into the shape of pearls, either small () or large (). The pearls are subjected to a form of heat-moisture treatment, which can extend shelf life up to 2 years.\nTapioca pearls have many unique properties that contribute to texture and mouth feel. Many of these physical properties are a result of its starch composition and are significantly affected by processing. Tapioca pearls are characteristically soft and chewy, with a prominent elastic texture and translucent appearance.\nSouth America.\nIn Colombia and Venezuela, arepas may be made with tapioca flour rather than cornmeal. Tapioca arepas probably predate cornmeal arepas; among traditional cultures of the Caribbean, the name for them is casabe. Throughout both Spanish and Portuguese South America, the tapioca, or yuca, starch is used to make regional variations of the baked cheese bun, known locally as \"pandebono\", \"pan de yuca\", \"p\u00e3o de queijo\", \"chip\u00e1\", or \"cu\u00f1ap\u00e9\", among other names.\nThe whole, unprocessed cassava root also has several culinary uses throughout South America.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazilian cuisine, tapioca is used in making many foods. In beiju (or biju), also simply called \"tapioca,\" the tapioca is moistened, strained through a sieve to become a coarse flour, then sprinkled onto a hot griddle or pan, where the heat makes the moist grains fuse into a flatbread which resembles a pancake or crepe. Then it may be buttered and eaten like toast (its most common use as a breakfast dish), or it may be filled with savory or sweet fillings, which define the kind of meal the tapioca is used for: breakfast/dinner or dessert. Fillings include butter, cheese, ham, bacon, vegetables, various kinds of meat, chocolate, fruits such as ground coconut, condensed milk, chocolate with slices of banana or strawberry, Nutella and cinnamon. This dish is usually served warm.\nA regional dessert called \"sagu\" is also made in Southern Brazil from tapioca pearls traditionally cooked with cinnamon and cloves in red wine, although other fruit flavors may be used. The cassava root is known by different names throughout the country: \"mandioca\" in the North, Central-West, and S\u00e3o Paulo; \"macaxeira\" in the Northeast; \"aipim\" in the Southeast and South.\nThe fine-grained tapioca starch is called \"polvilho,\" and it is classified as either \"sweet\" or \"sour.\" Sour \"polvilho\" is commonly used in dishes such as \"p\u00e3o de queijo\" or \"cheese bread,\" in which the starch is mixed with a hard cheese, usually matured Minas cheese (could be substituted by Parmesan cheese), eggs and butter and baked in the oven. The final result is an aromatic, chewy, and often crusty kind of bread that is ubiquitous across the country. Sweet \"polvilho\" is commonly used in cookies or cakes.\nNorth America.\nWhile frequently associated with tapioca pudding, a dessert in the United States, tapioca has other uses. People on gluten-free diets can eat bread made with tapioca flour (although some tapioca flour has wheat added to it). Tapioca syrup is sometimes added as a sweetener to a wide variety of foods and beverages as an alternative to sucrose or corn syrup.\nWest Indies.\nTapioca is a staple food from which dishes such as pepper pot as well as alcohol are made. It may be used to clean the teeth, as a foodstuff cooked with meats or fish, and in desserts such as cassava pone.\nSpecifically in rural Cuba early in Spanish rule, tapioca's popularity grew because it was easy to cultivate the crop and to transport it to nearby Spanish settlements, eventually influencing the way land and people were divided in that early imperial era.\nAsia.\nIn various Asian countries, tapioca pearls are widely used in desserts and drinks including Taiwanese bubble tea.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIn Southeast Asia, the cassava root is commonly cut into slices, wedges or strips, fried, and served as tapioca chips, similar to potato chips, wedges or french fries. Another method is to boil large blocks until soft and serve them with grated coconut as a dessert, either slightly salted or sweetened, usually with palm sugar syrup. In Thailand, this dish is called \"mansampalang\" (\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e1b\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07).\nCommercially prepared tapioca has many uses. Tapioca powder is commonly used as a thickener for soups and other liquid foods. It is also used as a binder in pharmaceutical tablets and natural paints. The flour is used to make tender breads, cakes, biscuits, cookies, and other delicacies. Tapioca flakes are used to thicken the filling of pies made with fruits having a high water content.\nA typical recipe for tapioca jelly can be made by washing two tablespoonfuls of tapioca, pouring a pint of water over it, and soaking it for three hours. The mixture is placed over low heat and simmered until quite clear. If too thick, a little boiling water can be added. It can be sweetened with white sugar, flavored with coconut milk or a little wine, and eaten alone or with cream.\nIndonesia.\nKrupuk, or traditional Indonesian crackers, is a significant use of tapioca starch in Indonesia. The most common krupuk is \"kerupuk kampung\" or \"kerupuk aci\" made of tapioca starch. The tapioca starch might be flavored with minced shrimp as \"krupuk udang\" (prawn cracker) or \"krupuk ikan\" (fish cracker). The thinly sliced or sometimes quite thick cassava was also sun-dried and deep fried to be made as \"kripik singkong\" crackers (cassava chips or tapioca chips). A variant of hot and spicy \"kripik singkong\" coated with sugar and chili pepper is known as \"kripik balado\" or \"keripik sanjay\", a specialty of Bukittinggi city in West Sumatra.\nCilok is a tapioca dumpling snack. Tapai is made by fermenting large blocks with a yeast-like bacteria culture to produce a sweet and slightly alcoholic dessert. Further fermentation releases more liquids and alcohol, producing \"Tuak\", a sour alcoholic beverage.\nMalaysia.\nA variation of the chips popular amongst the Malays is \"kerepek pedas\", where the crisps are coated with a hot, sweet, and tangy chili and onion paste, or sambal, usually with fried anchovies and peanuts added.\nThe cultivation of the plant is also extensively present in the Malay Peninsula, where in the hands of the Chinese, cassava tubers weighing from are first scraped and then washed carefully. By being passed between rollers, they are reduced to a pulp which is again carefully washed, then shaken up with water. This causes the fecula to separate and pass through a very fine sieve, resulting in flour. The flour is repeatedly washed and then placed on mats to bleach via sun exposure and air. Different applications may be applied here to give rise to the popular and loved tapioca pearls in bubble tea beverages, also known as boba. The pearl tapioca is achieved by placing the flour in a cradle-shaped frame covered with canvas, where it's slightly moistened and rotated to be granulated. Finally, it is dried in the sun, then over the fire in a greased iron pan, and ready for the market.\nSouth Asia.\nIn South Asia, tapioca pearls are known as \"sagudana\", \"sabudana\" or \"shabudana\" (pearl sago) or \"sabba akki\" (in Kannada). The pearls are used to make snacks.\nBangladesh.\nSagudana is sometimes used in dessert dishes. Faluda, a popular food, is also prepared with curd, ice, and other ingredients during summer.\nIndia.\nTapioca pearls are a common ingredient of traditional Indian dishes such as kheer.\nTapioca pearls are used to make \"Sabudana khichdi, pakoda, paratha\" in Maharashtra, which is commonly eaten during \"vrat\" (fasting). Indians generally soak it overnight or 6\u20138 hours in before cooking.\nCassava is referred to as Tapioca in Indian English usage. Cassava is called kappa or maracheeni in Malayalam.\nIt was introduced in 1880\u20131885 AD by the then Maharaja of Travancore, Vishakham Thirunal Rama Varma after a great famine hit the kingdom, as a substitute for rice.\nTapioca is widely consumed across Kerala. It is taken as breakfast or as a staple food. It is boiled (after skinning and cutting it into large pieces of about long or into small cubes) in water till adequately cooked, and the water is drained off. Once cooked, it can be mixed with grated coconut, chili, salt, turmeric, etc., then steamed and mashed into a dry pudding. If desired, this can be garnished with oil with mustard, onion, curry leaves, etc. Tapioca pieces (chendan kappa) are often eaten with simple chili sauce (a paste of green/red chili, shallots, garlic, salt, and oil).\nMashed tapioca is paired with meat or fish curry, especially sardines, as a delicacy in Kerala. Another popular combination is mashed tapioca with dried salted sardines directly cooked on charcoal and green chili.\nTapioca can be stored for extended periods by parboiling, drying it after skinning, and slicing it into 0.5\u00a0cm thick pieces. This is called unakka kappa (dried tapioca). Tapioca chips, thinly sliced tapioca wafers, similar to potato chips, are also extremely popular.\nIn Tamil, the roots of tapioca are called \"maravalli kizhangu\" and are used to prepare chips.\nTapioca pearls are referred to as \"javvarisi\" in Tamil. Most of the delicacies are cooked from this form of tapioca because it is easier to handle than the raw root itself. Tapioca is cultivated more in several districts, providing steady income to farmers in Tamil Nadu. Tapioca can be consumed raw (after removing the skins/outer cover) or boiled for various dishes or snacks.\nIn Nagaland and Mizoram in Northeast India, tapioca is eaten as a snack. It is usually boiled with a bit of salt in water after skinning it, or snacks are made by drying the tapioca after cutting it. It is then powdered into flour and turned into dough to either make a fired or baked biscuit. In their local dialect, they call it \"kuri aloo\", meaning \"wood potato.\" All groups of society eat these chips as a delicacy. The skin of the tapioca, which is not edible for humans, is kept aside to prepare food for domesticated pigs.\nIn Assam, sabudana is also used as a substitute diet against boiled rice (bhaat) for the sick, elderly, or infirm for easy digestion and strength.\nSri Lanka.\nIt is known as \"mangnokka\" in Sri Lanka, as well as by its Sinhalese and Tamil names. It is generally eaten boiled with a chili onion mixture called \"lunu miris sambol\" (a type of salsa) or coconut sambal. Another popular cassava dish is a curry cooked in coconut milk with a splash of turmeric. At the same time, it is popular to have tapioca pearls prepared as a delicacy. At one time, tapioca pearls were used to starch clothes by boiling tapioca pearls with the clothes. Spiced cassava chips are a popular snack usually sold by street vendors and street-side shops.\nAfrica.\nTapioca is eaten in the regions of Nigeria and Ghana as a common meal, usually at breakfast. Cassava is a staple food in West Africa, where it is widely eaten. In Nigeria, cassava is grated and dry roasted into \"garri\"; this is consumed by adding water, sugar, and or peanuts accompanied by meat or smoked fish. Garri is also made into \"eba\" by adding hot water; this is eaten with stew or soup. The Ijebu people of Nigeria make a cold water variant of eba by pounding the mixture with their fist until it becomes homogeneous; this is called \"feshelu\". The Egbas of Abeokuta, Ogun State peel, dry, and grind cassava into a powder called \"elubo\", which is then made into \"amala paki\" and eaten with a jute leaf stew called \"ewedu\".\nIn Lagos, cassava is processed into tapioca which is cooked in coconut milk and sugar; this can be eaten as a breakfast meal or as a dessert at parties or dinner. This is called \"mengau\".\nThe Igbos of Eastern Nigeria add palm oil and other seasonings to boiled and grated cassava, a dish called \"abacha\".\nPeople of the Niger Delta extract starch from cassava cooked into a starch eaten with pepper soup.\nIn Ghana, cassava is peeled, boiled until tender, and pounded in a large wooden mortar and pestle until it becomes homogeneous. This is called \"fufu\". It is eaten with soup.\nEurope.\nIn Belgium, tiny white tapioca pearls are added to clear soups. Tapioca pearls are used in French desserts, such as parfaits. A savory snack in the United Kingdom, Skips, is made from flavored tapioca.\nTapioca is also widely available in its dried forms and is used in some countries to make tapioca pudding.\nOther uses.\nTapioca root can be used to manufacture biodegradable bags developed from a tapioca resin of the plant as a viable plastic substitute. The product is renewable, reusable and recyclable. Other tapioca resin products include gloves, capes and aprons.\nTapioca starch, used commonly for starching shirts and garments before ironing, may be sold in bottles of natural gum starch to be dissolved in water or in spray cans.\nThe low amylose and low residual content, combined with the high molecular weight of its amylose, make tapioca a useful starting material for modification into a variety of specialty products. Tapioca starch applications in specialty products have become increasingly popular. The effects of additives on thermal transitions and physical and chemical properties can affect the quality and storage stability of tapioca-based products.\nSalt is often added to starch-based products to enhance flavor and functionality, as it can increase the gelatinization temperature of tapioca starch and delay the retrogradation of the gels formed upon cooling. Cations, particularly Na+ and Ca2+, can interact electrostatically with the oxygen atoms in the glucose molecule of the starch polymer. This interaction induces an antiplasticizing effect and increases competition for available water, increasing the glass transition temperature of the gelatinized molecule.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A member of the Democratic-Republican Party, he is primarily remembered for the killing of Alexander Hamilton in a duel, as well as his alleged conspiracy to take parts of the United States or the Spanish Empire to form an independent country.\nBurr was born to a prominent family in what was then the Province of New Jersey. After studying theology at Princeton University, he began his career as a lawyer before joining the Continental Army as an officer in the American Revolutionary War in 1775. After leaving military service in 1779, Burr practiced law in New York City, where he became a leading politician and helped form the new Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican Party.\nIn 1791, Burr was elected to the United States Senate, where he served until 1797. He later ran in the 1800 presidential election. An Electoral College tie between Burr and Thomas Jefferson resulted in the U.S. House of Representatives voting in Jefferson's favor, with Burr becoming Jefferson's vice president due to receiving the second-highest share of the votes. Although Burr maintained that he supported Jefferson, the president was somewhat at odds with Burr, who was relegated to the sidelines of the administration during his vice presidency and was not selected as Jefferson's running mate in 1804 after the ratification of the 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nBurr traveled west to the American frontier, seeking new economic and political opportunities. His secretive activities led to his 1807 arrest in Alabama on charges of treason. He was brought to trial more than once for what became known as the Burr conspiracy, an alleged plot to create an independent country led by Burr, but was acquitted each time. For a short period of time, Burr left the United States to live in Europe. He returned in 1812 and resumed practicing law in New York City. He died of a stroke on September 14, 1836, at the age of 80.\nEarly life and education.\nAaron Burr Jr. was born on February 6, 1756, in Newark, in what was then the Province of New Jersey, one of the Thirteen Colonies of colonial era British America. He was the second child of the Reverend Aaron Burr Sr., a Presbyterian minister and second president of the College of New Jersey, which later became Princeton University. His mother, Esther Edwards Burr, was the daughter of Jonathan Edwards, a theologian, and his wife Sarah Edwards. He had one older sister, Sarah, who was also known as Sally.\nIn 1757, Burr's father died while serving as president of College of New Jersey, which later became Princeton University. His grandfather, Jonathan Edwards, succeeded his father as the college's president, and lived with Burr and his mother in December 1757. Edwards died in March 1758, and Burr's mother and grandmother died the same year, leaving Burr and his sister orphaned when he was two years old. Young Burr and his sister were then placed with the William Shippen family in the Philadelphia, capital of British America. The following year, in 1759, the children's guardianship was assumed by their 21-year-old maternal uncle, Timothy Edwards. The following year, Edwards married Rhoda Ogden, and moved the family to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Burr attended the Elizabethtown Academy. Burr had a very strained relationship with his uncle, who was often physically abusive. As a child, he made several attempts to run away from home.\nAt age 13, Burr was admitted to the College of New Jersey as a sophomore, where he joined the American Whig Society and the Cliosophic Society, the college's literary and debating societies. In 1772, at age 16, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree, but continued studying theology at Princeton for an additional year. He then undertook rigorous theological training with Joseph Bellamy, a Presbyterian, but changed his career path after two years. At age 19, he moved to Litchfield, Connecticut to study law with his brother-in-law Tapping Reeve, founder of the Litchfield Law School. In 1775, news reached Litchfield of the clashes with British troops in the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which launched the American Revolutionary War, and Burr put his studies on hold to enlist in the Continental Army, whose commander-in-chief was George Washington.\nCareer.\nRevolutionary War.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Burr took part in Colonel Benedict Arnold's expedition to Quebec, an arduous trek of more than through the northern frontier of the Province of Massachusetts Bay (now Maine). Arnold was impressed by Burr's \"great spirit and resolution\" during the long march. He sent him up the Saint Lawrence River to contact General Richard Montgomery, who had taken Montreal, and escort him to Quebec. Montgomery then promoted Burr to captain and made him an aide-de-camp. Burr distinguished himself during the Battle of Quebec on December 31, 1775, where he attempted to recover Montgomery's corpse after he had been killed. However, his attempts to rescue the body of his general were short-lived, as Burr gave up due to the harsh conditions of the snow and the dead weight of Montgomery's body.\nIn the spring of 1776, Burr's relative Matthias Ogden helped him to secure a position with George Washington's staff in Manhattan, but he quit on June 26 to be on the battlefield. General Israel Putnam took Burr under his wing, and Burr saved an entire brigade from capture after the British landing in Manhattan by his vigilance in the retreat from Lower Manhattan to Harlem. Washington failed to commend his actions in the next day's General Orders, which was the fastest way to obtain a promotion. Burr was already a nationally known hero, but he never received a commendation. According to Ogden, he was infuriated by the incident, which may have led to the eventual estrangement between him and Washington. Nevertheless, Burr defended Washington's decision to evacuate New York as \"a necessary consequence\". It was not until the 1790s that the two men found themselves on opposite sides in politics.\nBurr was briefly posted in Kingsbridge during 1776, at which time he was charged with protecting 14-year-old Margaret Moncrieffe, the daughter of Staten Island-based British Major Thomas Moncrieffe. Miss Moncrieffe was in Manhattan \"behind enemy lines\", and Major Moncrieffe asked Washington to ensure her safe return there. Burr fell in love with Margaret, and her attempts to remain with Burr were unsuccessful.\nIn late 1776, Burr attempted to secure Washington's approval to retake fortifications on Staten Island, which were then held by the British, citing his deep familiarity with the area. Washington said he wanted to defer such an action until later in the conflict, and ultimately chose not to pursue it. The British learned of Burr's plans and later took extra precautions.\nIn July 1777, Burr was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed virtual leadership of Malcolm's Additional Continental Regiment. There were approximately 300 men under Colonel William Malcolm's nominal command, but Malcolm was frequently called upon to perform other duties, leaving Burr in charge. The regiment successfully fought off many nighttime raids into central New Jersey by Manhattan-based British troops who arrived by water. Later that year, Burr commanded a small contingent during the harsh winter encampment at Valley Forge, guarding \"the Gulph\", an isolated pass that controlled one approach to the camp. He imposed discipline and defeated an attempted mutiny by some of the troops.\nBurr's regiment was devastated by British artillery on June 28, 1778, at the Battle of Monmouth in New Jersey, and Burr suffered heatstroke and exhaustion. Washington denied Burr's request for medical leave without pay, and instead placed Burr in temporary command of the garrison at West Point, New York, until his recovery.\nIn January 1779, Burr was assigned to Westchester County, New York, in command of Malcolm's Regiment, a region between the British post at Kingsbridge and that of the Americans about to the north. This district was part of the more significant command of General Alexander McDougall, and there was much turbulence and plundering by lawless bands of civilians and by raiding parties of ill-disciplined soldiers from both armies.\nDue to continuing poor health, Burr resigned from the Continental Army in March 1779. During his recovery, Burr carried urgent messages to Washington and various officers at the request of Generals McDougall and Arthur St. Clair. On July 5, 1779, he rallied a group of Yale students at New Haven, Connecticut, along with Captain James Hillhouse and the Second Connecticut Governor's Guards, in a skirmish with the British at the West River. The British advance was repulsed, forcing them to enter New Haven from nearby Hamden.\nIn 1783, Burr became an Original Member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of officers who had served in the Continental Army and Navy during the Revolution.\nMarriage to Theodosia Bartow Prevost.\nBurr met Theodosia Bartow Prevost in August 1778 while she was married to Jacques Marcus Prevost, a Swiss-born British officer in the Royal American Regiment. In Prevost's absence, Burr began regularly visiting Theodosia at The Hermitage, her home in New Jersey. Theodosia would go on to visit Burr many times throughout his stay at West Point New York in June through July 1778. Although she was ten years older than Burr, the constant visits provoked gossip, and by 1780 the two were openly lovers. In December 1781, Burr learned that Jacques Prevost had died of yellow fever while serving in Jamaica.\nBurr and Theodosia were married in 1782, and they moved to a house on Wall Street in Lower Manhattan. After several years of severe illness, Theodosia died in 1794 from stomach or uterine cancer. Their only child to survive to adulthood was Theodosia Burr Alston, born in 1783.\nLaw and politics.\nIn the autumn of 1780, Burr resumed his study of law with Thomas Smith of Haverstraw. He was licensed as an attorney in Albany, New York, in January 1782, and was admitted to the bar as a counselor that April. He promptly opened a successful law office in Albany. He moved his law practice to New York City the following year, after the British evacuated the city.\nBurr quickly became a key player in politics, especially in New York, largely due to the power of the Tammany Society (which became Tammany Hall). Burr converted it from a social club into a political machine to help Jefferson reach the presidency, particularly in New York City.\nGovernment.\nBurr served in the New York State Assembly in 1784\u201385. In 1784, as an assemblyman, he unsuccessfully sought to abolish slavery immediately following the war, despite having owned slaves himself. He also continued his military service as a lieutenant colonel and commander of a regiment in the militia brigade commanded by William Malcolm. He became seriously involved in politics in 1789, when Governor George Clinton appointed him as New York State Attorney General. He was also Commissioner of Revolutionary War Claims.\nIn 1791, Burr was elected by the legislature as a United States Senator from New York, defeating incumbent General Philip Schuyler. During his time in the Senate, Burr made several federalist enemies due to his beliefs, including his opposition to Hamilton's proposed financial system. During the 1795 debates on the Jay Treaty, Burr gave a speech illustrating his alignment with the Democratic-Republican party; he would formally join the party prior to the end of his Senatorial term. In Burr's last year of being a senator, he opposed Washington's foreigner policy in Washington's Farewell Address. Rather than trying to be reelected, Burr resigned from the Senate in 1797, after only one term.\nBurr ran in the 1796 presidential election and received 30 electoral votes, coming in fourth behind John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Pinckney. He was shocked by this defeat, but many Democratic-Republican electors voted for Jefferson and a candidate other than Burr.\nPresident John Adams appointed Washington as commanding general of U.S. forces in 1798, but he rejected Burr's application for a brigadier general's commission during the Quasi-War with France. Washington wrote, \"By all that I have known and heard, Colonel Burr is a brave and able officer, but the question is whether he has not equal talents at intrigue.\" Burr returned to the New York State Assembly in 1798 and served there through 1799. During this time, he cooperated with the Holland Land Company in gaining passage of a law to permit aliens to hold and convey lands. National parties became clearly defined during Adams' presidency, and Burr loosely associated himself with the Democratic-Republicans. However, he had moderate Federalist allies such as Senator Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey.\nManhattan Company.\nIn September 1799, Burr founded his own bank, the Manhattan Company, and the enmity between him and Hamilton may have arisen from how he did so. Before the establishment of Burr's bank, the Federalists held a monopoly on banking interests in New York via the federal government's Bank of the United States and Hamilton's Bank of New York. These banks financed operations of significant business interests owned by aristocratic members of the city. Hamilton had prevented the formation of rival banks. Small businessmen relied on tontines to buy property and establish a voting voice.\nBurr used his power as the head of the New York State Assembly in order to convince his delegation to let a private company run the project as a doctor, Joseph Browne had previously suggested. He solicited support from Hamilton and other Federalists under the guise that he was establishing a badly needed water company for Manhattan. He secretly changed the application for a state charter at the last minute to include the ability to invest surplus funds in any cause that did not violate state law, and dropped any pretense of founding a water company once he had gained approval, but he did dig a well and built a large working water storage tank on the site of his bank, which was still standing and apparently still working in 1898. Hamilton and other supporters believed that Burr had acted \"dishonorably\" for tricking them. Meanwhile, construction was delayed on a safe water system for Manhattan, and writer Ron Chernow suggests that the delay may have contributed to deaths during a subsequent malaria epidemic. However, Museum of American Finance employees Maura Ferguson and Sarah Poole believe that the epidemic was not malaria, but yellow fever.\nThe Manhattan Company was more than a bank; it was a tool to promote Democratic-Republican power and influence, and its loans were directed to partisans. By extending credit to small businessmen, who then obtained enough property to gain the franchise to vote, the bank was able to increase the party's electorate. Federalist bankers in New York responded by trying to organize a credit boycott of Democratic-Republican businessmen.\nShortly after the bank's founding, Burr fought a duel with John Barker Church, whose wife Angelica was the sister-in-law of Alexander Hamilton. Church had accused Burr of taking a bribe from the Holland Land Company in exchange for his political influence. Burr and Church fired at each other and missed, and afterward, Church acknowledged that he was wrong to have accused Burr without proof. Burr accepted this as an apology, and the two men shook hands and ended the dispute.\n1800 presidential election.\nIn the 1800 United States presidential election, Burr combined the political influence of the Manhattan Company with party campaign innovations to deliver New York's support for Thomas Jefferson. That year, New York's state legislature chose the presidential electors, as they had four years earlier, in 1796, when they gave their support to John Adams. Prior to the April 1800 legislative elections, the State Assembly was controlled by the Federalists. The City of New York elected assembly members on an at-large basis. Burr and Hamilton were the key campaigners for their respective parties. Burr's Democratic-Republican slate of assemblymen was elected, giving the party control of the legislature, which in turn gave New York State's electoral votes to Jefferson and Burr. This drove another wedge between Burr and Hamilton, who had developed a rivalry with Jefferson.\nBurr enlisted the help of Tammany Hall to win the voting for selection of Electoral College delegates. He gained a place on the Democratic-Republican presidential ticket with Jefferson in the 1800 election. Jefferson and Burr won New York, and tied for the presidency overall, with 73 electoral votes each. Members of the Democratic-Republican Party understood they intended that Jefferson should be president and Burr vice president, but the tied vote required that the final choice be made by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each of the sixteen states having one vote, and nine votes needed for election.\nBurr remained quiet publicly, refusing to surrender the presidency to Jefferson, who was seen as the great enemy of the Federalists. Rumors circulated that he and a faction of Federalists were encouraging Democratic-Republican representatives to vote for him, blocking Jefferson's election in the House. However, solid evidence of such a conspiracy was lacking, and historians generally gave Burr the benefit of the doubt. In 2011, however, historian Thomas Baker discovered a previously unknown letter from William P. Van Ness to Edward Livingston, two leading Democratic-Republicans in New York. Van Ness was very close to Burr, serving as his second in the duel with Alexander Hamilton. As a leading Democratic-Republican, Van Ness secretly supported the Federalist plan to elect Burr as president and tried to get Livingston to join. Livingston agreed at first, then reversed himself. Baker argues that Burr probably supported the Van Ness plan: \"There is a compelling pattern of circumstantial evidence, much of it newly discovered, that strongly suggests Aaron Burr did exactly that as part of a stealth campaign to compass the presidency for himself.\" The attempt did not work, however, at least in part because of Livingston's reversal and especially Hamilton's vigorous opposition to Burr. Jefferson was ultimately elected president, and Burr vice president.\nVice presidency (1801\u20131805).\nJefferson never trusted Burr, so he was effectively shut out of party matters. As vice president, Burr earned praise from some enemies for his even-handedness and his judicial manner as President of the Senate; he fostered some practices for that office that have become time-honored traditions. Burr's judicial manner in presiding over the impeachment trial of Justice Samuel Chase has been credited as helping to preserve the principle of judicial independence that was established by \"Marbury v. Madison\" in 1803. One newspaper wrote that Burr had conducted the proceedings with the \"impartiality of an angel, but with the rigor of a devil\".\nBurr was not nominated to a second term as Jefferson's running mate in the 1804 election, and Clinton replaced Burr as vice president on March 4, 1805. Burr's farewell speech on March 2, 1805, moved some of his harshest critics in the Senate to tears. But the 20-minute speech was never recorded in full, and has been preserved only in short quotes and descriptions of the address, which defended the American system of government.\nDuel with Hamilton.\nWhen it became clear that Jefferson would drop Burr from his ticket in the 1804 election, Burr ran for governor of New York instead. He lost the gubernatorial election to little known Morgan Lewis, in what was the most significant margin of loss in the state's history up to that time. Burr blamed his loss on a personal smear campaign believed to have been orchestrated by his party rivals, including Clinton. Hamilton also opposed Burr, due to his belief that Burr had entertained a Federalist secession movement in New York. In April, the \"Albany Register\" published a letter from Dr. Charles D. Cooper to Senator Philip Schuyler, which relayed Hamilton's judgment that Burr was \"a dangerous man and one who ought not to be trusted with the reins of government,\" and claiming to know of \"a still more despicable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr\". In June, Burr sent this letter to Hamilton, seeking an affirmation or disavowal of Cooper's characterization of Hamilton's remarks.\nHamilton replied that Burr should give specifics of his remarks, not Cooper's, and said he could not answer regarding Cooper's interpretation. A few more letters followed, in which the exchange escalated to Burr's demanding that Hamilton recant or deny any statement disparaging Burr's honor over the past fifteen years. Hamilton, meaning what he said and wanting to ensure his reputation stayed clean for the future, did not. According to historian Thomas Fleming, Burr would have immediately published such an apology, and Hamilton's remaining power in the New York's Federalist party would have been diminished. Burr responded by challenging Hamilton to a duel, personal combat then formalized under rules known as \"code duello\".\nDueling was outlawed in New York, with bitter punishment awaiting any involved in dueling. It also was illegal in New Jersey, but the criminal ramifications were less severe. On July 11, 1804, the enemies met outside Weehawken, New Jersey, at the same location where Hamilton's oldest son, Philip Hamilton, had been killed in a duel three years earlier. Both men fired, and Hamilton was mortally wounded by a shot just above the hip.\nThe observers disagreed on who fired first. They did agree that there was a three-to-four-second interval between the first and the second shot, raising difficult questions in evaluating the two camps' versions. Historian William Weir speculated that Hamilton might have been undone by his machinations: secretly setting his pistol's trigger to require only a half-pound of pressure as opposed to the usual ten pounds. Weir contends, \"There is no evidence that Burr even knew that his pistol had a set trigger.\" Louisiana State University history professors Nancy Isenberg and Andrew Burstein concur with this, noting that \"Hamilton brought the pistols, which had a larger barrel than regular dueling pistols, and a secret hair-trigger, and were therefore much more deadly,\" and conclude that \"Hamilton gave himself an unfair advantage in their duel, and got the worst of it anyway.\" However, other accounts state that Hamilton reportedly responded \"not this time\" when his second, Nathaniel Pendleton, asked whether he would set the hair-trigger feature.\nDavid O. Stewart, in his biography of Burr, \"American Emperor\", notes that the reports of Hamilton's intentionally missing Burr with his shot began to be published in newspaper reports in papers friendly to Hamilton only in the days after his death. However, Ron Chernow, in his 2004 biography \"Alexander Hamilton\", states that Hamilton told numerous friends well before the duel of his intention to avoid firing at Burr. Additionally, Hamilton wrote several letters, including a \"Statement on Impending Duel With Aaron Burr\" and his last missives to his wife dated before the duel, which also attest to his intention. The second shot, witnesses reported, followed so soon after the first that witnesses could not agree on who fired first. Before the duel proper, Hamilton took a good deal of time getting used to the feel and weight of the pistol and putting on his glasses to see his opponent more clearly. The seconds placed Hamilton so that Burr would have the rising sun behind him, and during the brief duel, one witness reported, Hamilton seemed to be hindered by this placement as the sun was in his eyes.\nEach man took one shot. Burr's shot fatally injured Hamilton. While it is unclear whether Hamilton's was purposely fired into the air, Burr's bullet entered Hamilton's abdomen above his right hip, piercing his liver and spine. Hamilton was evacuated to the Manhattan residence of his friend, William Bayard Jr., where he and his family received visitors including Episcopal bishop Benjamin Moore, who gave Hamilton last rites. Burr was charged with multiple crimes, including murder, in New York and New Jersey, but was never tried in either jurisdiction.\nBurr fled to South Carolina, where his daughter lived with her family, but soon returned to Philadelphia and then to Washington, D.C. to complete his term as vice president. He avoided New York and New Jersey for a time, but all the charges against him were eventually dropped. In the case of New Jersey, the indictment was thrown out on the basis that, although Hamilton was shot in New Jersey, he died in New York.\nPost-vice presidency (1805\u20131836).\nConspiracy and trial.\nAfter Burr left the vice presidency at the end of his term in 1805, he journeyed to the western frontier, areas west of the Allegheny Mountains and down the Ohio River Valley, eventually reaching the lands acquired in the Louisiana Purchase. He leased 40,000 acres (16,000 ha) of land, known as the Bastrop Tract, along the Ouachita River, in present-day Louisiana, from the Spanish government. Starting in Pittsburgh and then proceeding to Beaver, Pennsylvania and Wheeling, Virginia, and onward, he drummed up support for his planned settlement, whose purpose and status was unclear.\nBurr's most important contact was General James Wilkinson, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army at New Orleans, and governor of the Louisiana Territory. Others included Harman Blennerhassett, who offered the use of his private island for training and outfitting Burr's expedition. Wilkinson later proved to be a bad choice.\nBurr envisioned the probability of the Spanish-American War. In case war was declared, Andrew Jackson, then commander of Tennessee's militia, stood ready to assist Burr.\nBurr's expedition of about eighty men carried modest arms for hunting and no war materiel was ever revealed even when Blennerhassett Island was seized by Ohio's militia. Burr vowed the aim of his conspiracy was that if he settled there with a large group of armed farmers and war broke out, he would likely face a force with which to fight and claim land for himself thereby restoring his wealth. However, the war did not emerge as soon as Burr expected. In 1819, the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty secured Florida for the U.S. without a fight, and war in Texas did not commence until 1836, the year Burr died.\nAfter a near-incident with Spanish forces at Natchitoches, Wilkinson decided he could best protect himself by betraying Burr's plans to his Spanish spymasters and to President Jefferson. Jefferson issued an order for Burr's arrest, declaring him a traitor before any indictment. Burr read this in a newspaper in the Territory of Orleans on January 10, 1807. Several journals reported on the subject, creating a pool of rumors, most against Burr. Jefferson's warrant put federal agents on his trail. Burr twice turned himself in to federal authorities, and both times judges found his actions legal and released him.\nJefferson's warrant, however, followed Burr, who fled toward Spanish Florida. He was intercepted at Wakefield, in Mississippi Territory in present-day Alabama, on February 19, 1807, by Edmund P. Gaines and Nicholas Perkins III. He was confined to Fort Stoddert after being arrested on charges of treason.\nBurr's secret correspondence with Anthony Merry and the Marquis of Casa Yrujo, the British and Spanish ministers in Washington, D.C., were eventually revealed. Burr tried to secure money and conceal what may have been his true design, which was aiding Mexico in overthrowing the Kingdom of Spain's governance of the Southwest. If Burr intended to establish a dynasty in what later became Mexican territory, such an offense at the time was a misdemeanor under the Neutrality Act of 1794, which Congress passed to block filibuster expeditions against U.S. neighbors, including those of George Rogers Clark and William Blount. Despite this, Thomas Jefferson sought the highest charges against Burr.\nIn 1807, Burr was charged with treason in U.S. circuit court in Richmond, Virginia. His defense lawyers included Edmund Randolph, John Wickham, Luther Martin, and Benjamin Gaines Botts. Burr was arraigned four times for treason prior to being indicted before a grand jury. The only physical evidence presented to the grand jury was Wilkinson's letter from Burr, which proposed stealing land in the Louisiana Purchase. During the grand jury's deliberations, however, the court discovered that the letter was written in Wilkinson's handwriting. He said he had made a copy because he had lost the original. The grand jury dismissed the letter out as evidence, and the news made a laughingstock of Wilkinson for the rest of the proceedings.\nThe trial, which was presided over by Chief Justice John Marshall, began on August 3. requires that treason either be admitted in open court or proven by an overt act witnessed by two people. Since no witnesses came forward, Burr was acquitted on September 1, despite efforts by the Jefferson administration to exert its political influence against him in the trial. Burr was immediately tried on a misdemeanor charge and was again acquitted.\nJefferson used his influence as president to seek Burr's conviction, leading the trial to be seen as a major test of the U.S. Constitution and the separation of powers. Jefferson challenged the authority of the Supreme Court and Chief Justice Marshall, who was appointed by John Adams and clashed with Jefferson over Adams' last-minute judicial appointments. Jefferson believed that Burr's treason was obvious. Burr sent a letter to Jefferson in which he stated that he could do Jefferson much harm. The case, as tried, was decided on whether Burr was present at certain events at certain times and in certain capacities. Jefferson used all of his personal influence in an attempt to convince Marshall to convict Burr, but Marshall was not swayed.\nHistorians Nancy Isenberg and Andrew Burstein write that Burr:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;was not guilty of treason, nor was he ever convicted, because there was no evidence, not one credible piece of testimony, and the star witness for the prosecution had to admit that he had doctored a letter implicating Burr.\nDavid O. Stewart, on the other hand, alleged that Burr was not explicitly guilty of treason, according to Marshall's definition, but evidence existed linking him to treasonous crimes. Bollman admitted to Jefferson during an interrogation that Burr planned to raise an army and invade Mexico. He said that Burr believed that he should be Mexico's monarch, since a republican government, in Burr's view, was not appropriate for Mexico.\nExile and return.\nBy the conclusion of his trial for treason, despite an acquittal, all of Burr's hopes for a political comeback had been dashed, and he fled America and his creditors for Europe. Dr. David Hosack, Hamilton's physician and a friend to both Hamilton and Burr, lent Burr money for passage on a ship.\nBurr lived in self-imposed exile from 1808 to 1812, passing most of this period in England, where he occupied a house on Craven Street, London. He became a good friend, even confidant, of the English Utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham, and on occasion lived at Bentham's home. He also spent time in Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and France. Ever hopeful, he solicited funding for renewing his plans for a conquest of Mexico but was rebuffed. He was ordered out of England and Emperor Napoleon of France refused to receive him. However, one of his ministers held an interview concerning Burr's goals for Spanish Florida or the British West Indies.\nAfter returning from Europe, Burr used the surname \"Edwards\", his mother's maiden name, for a while to avoid creditors. With help from old friends Samuel Swartwout and Matthew L. Davis, Burr returned to New York City and his law practice. Later he helped the heirs of the Eden family in a financial lawsuit. By the early 1820s, the remaining members of the Eden household, Eden's widow and two daughters, had become a surrogate family to Burr.\nLater life.\nDespite financial setbacks, Burr lived out the remainder of his life in New York in relative peace until 1833. On July 1 of that year, at age 77, he married Eliza Jumel, a wealthy widow who was nineteen years his junior. They lived together briefly at her residence which she had acquired with her first husband, the Morris-Jumel Mansion in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is now preserved and open to the public.\nSoon after the marriage, Jumel realized her fortune was dwindling due to Burr's land speculation losses, and separated from him after four months of marriage. The apocryphal story is that she chose Alexander Hamilton Jr. as her divorce lawyer in 1834, the same year Burr suffered an immobilizing stroke.\nPersonal life.\nIn addition to his daughter Theodosia, Burr was the father of at least three other children and he adopted two sons. Burr also acted as a parent to his two stepsons by his wife's first marriage and he became a mentor or guardian to several prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who lived in his home.\nBurr's daughter Theodosia.\nTheodosia Burr Alston was born in 1783 and was named after her mother. She was the only child of Burr's marriage to Theodosia Bartow Prevost who survived to adulthood. A second daughter, Sally, lived to the age of three. Two unnamed stillborns arrived later, with the first son in February 1787 and the second on July 9, 1788.\nBurr was a devoted and attentive father to Theodosia. Believing that a young woman should have an education equal to that of a young man, he prescribed a rigorous course of studies for her which included the classics, French, horsemanship and music. Their surviving correspondence indicates that he affectionately treated his daughter as a close friend and confidante as long as she lived. Theodosia was devoted to her father as well, once having wrote to him \"...you appear to me so superior, so elevated above all other men...\"\nTheodosia became widely known for her education and accomplishments. In 1801, she married Joseph Alston of South Carolina. They had a son together, Aaron Burr Alston, in 1802. In 1812, the young boy died of malaria at age ten. Following her son's death, Theodosia sent a letter to her father, stating, \"...there is no more joy for me, the world is a blank. I have lost my boy. My child is gone forever. He expired on the 30th of June.\"\n During the winter of 1812\u20131813, Theodosia was lost at sea with the schooner \"Patriot\" off the Carolinas. Although it is unknown what truly happened to Theodosia and the other passengers, the most common theories are that they were either murdered by pirates or shipwrecked in a storm. Burr and Mr. Alston personally chose to believe the theory that she had died in a storm, not wanting to think their beloved had been murdered.\nStepchildren and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\nUpon Burr's marriage, he became stepfather to the two teenage sons of his wife's first marriage. Augustine James Frederick Prevost (called \"Frederick\") and John Bartow Prevost had both joined their father in the Royal American Regiment in December 1780, at the ages of 16 and 14. When they returned in 1783 to become citizens of the United States, Burr acted as a father to them: he assumed responsibility for their education, gave both of them clerkships in his law office and frequently was accompanied by one of them as an assistant when he traveled on business. John was later appointed by Jefferson to a post in the Territory of Orleans as the first judge of the Louisiana Supreme Court.\nBurr served as a guardian to Nathalie de Lage de Volude (1782\u20131841) from 1794 to 1801, during Theodosia's childhood. The young daughter of a French marquis, Nathalie was taken to New York for safety during the French Revolution by her governess, Caroline de Senat. Burr opened his home to them, allowing Madame Senat to tutor private students there along with his daughter, and Nathalie became a companion and close friend to Theodosia. While traveling to France for an extended visit in 1801, Nathalie met Thomas Sumter Jr., a diplomat and the son of General Thomas Sumter. They married in Paris in March 1802, before returning to his home in South Carolina. From 1810 to 1821 they lived in Rio de Janeiro, where Sumter served as the American ambassador to Portugal during the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil. One of their children, Thomas De Lage Sumter, was a Congressman from South Carolina.\nIn the 1790s, Burr also took the painter John Vanderlyn into his home as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and provided him with financial support and patronage for 20 years. He arranged Vanderlyn's training by Gilbert Stuart in Philadelphia and sent him in 1796 to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he remained for six years.\nAdopted and acknowledged children.\nBurr adopted two sons, Aaron Columbus Burr and Charles Burdett, during the 1810s and 1820s after the death of his daughter Theodosia. Aaron (born Aaron Burr Columbe) was born in Paris in 1808 and arrived in America around 1815, and Charles was born in 1814. Both of the boys were reputed to be Burr's biological sons. A Burr biographer described Aaron Columbus Burr as \"the product of a Paris adventure\", conceived presumably during Burr's exile from the United States between 1808 and 1814.\nIn 1835, the year before his death, Burr acknowledged two young daughters whom he had fathered late in his life, by different mothers. Burr made specific provisions for his surviving daughters in a will dated January 11, 1835, in which he left \"all the rest and residue\" of his estate, after other specific bequests, to six-year-old Frances Ann (born c.\u20091829), and two-year-old Elizabeth (born c.\u20091833).\nUnacknowledged children.\nIn 1787 or earlier, Burr began a relationship with Mary Emmons, who was East Indian, likely of Bengali ethnicity. She worked as a servant in his household during his first marriage. She came from Calcutta to Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti), where she had lived under the adopted name Eug\u00e9nie Beauharnais before coming to America and taking on the name Mary Emmons. Burr fathered two children with Emmons, both of whom married into Philadelphia's \"Free Negro\" community in which their families became prominent:\nOne contemporary of John Pierre Burr identified him as a natural son of Burr in a published account, but Burr never acknowledged his relationship or children with Emmons during his life, in contrast to his adoption or acknowledgment of other children born later in his life.\nIn 2018, Louisa and John were acknowledged by the Aaron Burr Association as the children of Burr after Sherri Burr, a descendant of John Pierre, provided both documentary evidence and results of a DNA test to confirm a familial link between descendants of Burr and descendants of Pierre. The Association installed a headstone at Pierre's grave to mark his ancestry. Stuart Fisk Johnson, the president of the Association, commented, \"A few people didn't want to go into it because Aaron's first wife, Theodosia, was still alive, and dying of cancer [when Aaron fathered Pierre] ... But the embarrassment is not as important as it is to acknowledge and embrace actual living, robust, accomplished children.\"\nCharacter.\nBurr was a man of complex character who made many friends, but also many powerful enemies. He was indicted for murder after the death of Hamilton, but never prosecuted; he was reported by acquaintances to be curiously unmoved by Hamilton's death, expressing no regret for his role in the result. He was arrested and prosecuted for treason by President Jefferson, but acquitted. Although the charges were dropped, Burr remained distrusted by contemporaries for the rest of his life.\nIn his later years in New York, Burr provided money and education for several children, some of whom were reputed to be his natural children. To his friends and family, and often to strangers, he could be kind and generous. Jane Fairfield, the wife of the struggling poet Sumner Lincoln Fairfield, recorded in her autobiography that in the late 1820s, their friend Burr pawned his watch to provide for the care of the Fairfields' two children. Jane wrote that, while traveling, she and her husband had left the children in New York with their grandmother, who proved unable to provide adequate food or heat for them. The grandmother took the children to Burr's home and asked his help: \"[Burr] wept, and replied, 'Though I am poor and have not a dollar, the children of such a mother shall not suffer while I have a watch.' He hastened on this godlike errand, and quickly returned, having pawned the article for twenty dollars, which he gave to make comfortable my precious babes.\"\nBy Fairfield's account, Burr had lost his religious faith before that time; upon seeing a painting of Jesus' suffering, Burr candidly told her, \"It is a fable, my child; there never was such a being.\"\nBurr believed women to be intellectually equal to men and hung a portrait of Mary Wollstonecraft over his mantel. The Burrs' daughter, Theodosia, was taught dance, music, several languages and learned to shoot from horseback. Until her death at sea in 1813, she remained devoted to her father. Not only did Burr advocate education for women, upon his election to the New York legislature, he submitted a bill, which failed to pass, that would have allowed women to vote. Hamilton attacked Burr for supporting the idea that women were the intellectual equals of men.\nBurr was considered a notorious womanizer. In addition to cultivating relationships with women in his social circles, his journals indicate that he was a frequent patron of prostitutes during his travels in Europe; he recorded brief notes of dozens of such encounters, and the amounts he paid. He described \"sexual release as the only remedy for his restlessness and irritability\". Along with journals of his own, during the 1804 New York gubernatorial election, one of his enemies, James Cheetham, stated he had a list of \"the top 20 prostitutes in New York City\", all of whom mentioned they had Burr as a customer and favored him over the others.\nBurr also fought against anti-immigrant sentiment, led by Hamilton's Federalist party, which suggested that anyone without English heritage was a second-class citizen and even challenged the rights of non-Anglos to hold office. In response, Burr insisted that anyone who contributed to society deserved all the rights of any other citizen, no matter their background.\nJohn Quincy Adams wrote in his diary when Burr died: \"Burr's life, take it all together, was such as in any country of sound morals his friends would be desirous of burying in quiet oblivion.\" Adams' father, President John Adams, had frequently defended Burr during his life. At an earlier time, he wrote, Burr \"had served in the army, and came out of it with the character of a knight without fear and an able officer\".\nGordon S. Wood, a leading scholar of the revolutionary period, holds that it was Burr's character that put him at odds with the rest of the Founding Fathers, especially Madison, Jefferson and Hamilton. He believed that this led to his personal and political defeats and, ultimately, to his place outside the golden circle of revered revolutionary figures. Because of his habit of placing self-interest above the good of the whole, those men thought that Burr represented a serious threat to the ideals for which they had fought the revolution. Their ideal, as particularly embodied in Washington and Jefferson, was that of \"disinterested politics\", a government led by educated gentlemen. They would fulfill their duties in a spirit of public virtue and without regard to personal interests or pursuits. This was the core of an Enlightenment gentleman, and Burr's political enemies thought that he lacked that essential core. Hamilton thought that Burr's self-serving nature made him unfit to hold office, especially the presidency. Hamilton believed it \"a religious duty to oppose his career\", as he wrote in 1792.\nAlthough Hamilton considered Jefferson a political enemy, he also believed him a man of public virtue. Hamilton conducted an unrelenting campaign in the House of Representatives to prevent Burr's election to the presidency and gain election of his erstwhile enemy, Jefferson. Hamilton characterized Burr as exceedingly immoral, as well as \"unprincipled &amp; dangerous\". Hamilton deemed his political quest as one for \"permanent power\". He contended that Burr cared little about the Constitution and predicted that if he gained any more power, his leadership would continue to be for personal gain, while Jefferson was a true patriot and public servant committed to preserving the Constitution.\nDeath.\nBurr died in a boarding home after suffering two strokes in Port Richmond, New York, on Staten Island, on September 14, 1836, at age 80, the same day that his divorce was officially completed. The boarding house later became known as the St. James Hotel. He was buried near his father's gravesite in Princeton, New Jersey.\nLegacy.\nAlthough Burr is often remembered primarily for his duel with Hamilton, his establishment of guides and rules for the first impeachment trial set a high bar for behavior and procedures in the Senate chamber, many of which are followed today.\nHistorian Nancy Isenberg, seeking to explain Burr's negative image in modern times, wrote that his portrayal as a villain is actually the result of a smear campaign invented by his political enemies centuries ago, and then disseminated in newspapers, pamphlets and personal letters during and after his lifetime. According to Isenberg, pop-cultural portraits of Burr have repeated these distortions, transforming him into the quintessential \"bad guy\" of early American history. Stuart Fisk Johnson describes Burr as progressive thinker and doer, a brave military patriot and brilliant lawyer who helped establish some of the physical infrastructure and guiding legal principles which helped in the founding of America.\nA lasting consequence of Burr's role in the election of 1800 was the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which changed how vice presidents were chosen. As was evident from the 1800 election, the situation could quickly arise where the vice president, as the defeated presidential candidate, could not work well with the president. The Twelfth Amendment required that electoral votes be cast separately for president and vice president.\nBurr is also sometimes seen as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, although this characterization is unusual.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "57455", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57455", "title": "Sago", "text": "Starch extracted from tropical palm stems\nSago () is a starch extracted from the pith, or spongy core tissue, of various tropical palm stems, especially those of \"Metroxylon sagu\". It is a major staple food for the lowland peoples of New Guinea and the Maluku Islands, where it is called \"saksak\", \"rabia\" and \"sagu\". The largest supply of sago comes from Melanesia region, particularly Eastern Indonesia. Large quantities of sago are sent to Europe and North America for cooking purposes. It is traditionally cooked and eaten in various forms, such as rolled into balls, mixed with boiling water to form a glue-like paste (papeda), or as a pancake.\nSago is often produced commercially in the form of \"pearls\" (small rounded starch aggregates, partly gelatinized by heating). Sago pearls can be boiled with water or milk and sugar to make a sweet sago pudding. Sago pearls are similar in appearance to the pearled starches of other origin, e.g. cassava starch (tapioca) and potato starch. They may be used interchangeably in some dishes, and tapioca pearls are often marketed as \"sago\", since they are much cheaper to produce. Compared to tapioca pearls, real sago pearls are off-white, uneven in size, brittle and cook very quickly.\nThe name \"sago\" is also sometimes used for starch extracted from other sources, especially the sago cycad, \"Cycas revoluta\". The sago cycad is also commonly known as the sago palm, although this is a misnomer as cycads are not palms. Extracting edible starch from the sago cycad requires special care due to the poisonous nature of cycads. Cycad sago is used for many of the same purposes as palm sago.\nThe fruit of palm trees from which the sago is produced is not allowed to ripen fully, as full ripening completes the life cycle of the tree and exhausts the starch reserves in the trunk to produce the seeds to the point of death, leaving a hollow shell. The palms are cut down when they are about 15 years old, just before or shortly after the inflorescence appears. The stems, which grow high, are split out. The starch-containing pith is taken from the stems and ground to powder. The powder is kneaded in water over a cloth or sieve to release the starch. The water with the starch passes into a trough where the starch settles. After a few washings, the starch is ready to be used in cooking. A single palm yields about of dry starch.\nHistorical records.\nSago was noted by the Chinese historian Zhao Rukuo (1170\u20131231) during the Song dynasty. In his \"Zhu Fan Zhi\" (1225), a collection of descriptions of foreign countries, he writes that the kingdom of Boni \"produces no wheat, but hemp and rice, and they use \"sha-hu\" (sago) for grain\".\nSources, extraction and preparation.\nPalm sago.\nThe sago palm, \"Metroxylon sagu\", is found in tropical lowland forest and freshwater swamps across Southeast Asia and New Guinea and is the primary source of sago. It tolerates a wide variety of soils and may reach 30 meters in height (including the leaves). Several other species of the genus \"Metroxylon\", particularly \"Metroxylon salomonense\" and \"Metroxylon amicarum\", are also used as sources of sago throughout Melanesia and Micronesia.\nSago palms grow very quickly, in clumps of different ages similar to bananas, one sucker matures, then flowers and dies. It is replaced by another sucker, with up to 1.5\u00a0m of vertical stem growth per year. The stems are thick and are either self-supporting or have a moderate climbing habit; the leaves are pinnate. Each palm trunk produces a single inflorescence at its tip at the end of its life. Sago palms are harvested at the age of 7\u201315 years, just before or shortly after the inflorescence appears and when the stems are full of starch stored for use in reproduction. One palm can yield 150\u2013300\u00a0kg of starch.\nSago is extracted from \"Metroxylon\" palms by splitting the stem lengthwise and removing the pith which is then crushed and kneaded to release the starch before being washed and strained to extract the starch from the fibrous residue. The raw starch suspension in water is then collected in a settling container.\nCycad sago.\nThe sago cycad, \"Cycas revoluta\", is a slow-growing wild or ornamental plant. Its common names \"sago palm\" and \"king sago palm\" are misnomers as cycads are not palms. Processed starch known as sago is made from this and other cycads. It is a less-common food source for some peoples of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Unlike palms, cycads are highly poisonous: most parts of the plant contain the neurotoxins cycasin and BMAA. Consumption of cycad seeds has been implicated in the outbreak of Parkinson's disease-like neurological disorder in Guam and other locations in the Pacific. Thus, before any part of the plant may safely be eaten the toxins must be removed through extended processing.\nSago is extracted from the sago cycad by cutting the pith from the stem, root and seeds of the cycads, grinding the pith to a coarse flour, before being dried, pounded, and soaked. The starch is then washed carefully and repeatedly to leach out the natural toxins. The starchy residue is then dried and cooked, producing a starch similar to palm sago/sabudana.\nCassava sago.\nIn many countries including Australia, Brazil, and India, tapioca pearls made from cassava root are also referred to as \"sago\", \"sagu\", \"sabudana\", etc.\nUses.\nNutrition.\nSago from \"Metroxylon\" palms is nearly pure carbohydrate and has very little protein, vitamins, or minerals. of dry sago typically comprises 94\u00a0grams of carbohydrate, 0.2\u00a0grams of protein, 0.5\u00a0grams of dietary fiber, 10\u00a0mg of calcium, 1.2\u00a0mg of iron and negligible amounts of fat, carotene, thiamine and ascorbic acid and yields approximately of food energy. Sago palms are typically found in areas unsuited for other forms of agriculture, so sago cultivation is often the most ecologically appropriate form of land use and the nutritional deficiencies of the food can often be compensated for with other readily available foods.\nSago starch can be baked (resulting in a product analogous to bread, pancake, or biscuit) or mixed with boiling water to form a paste. It is a main staple of many traditional communities in New Guinea, Maluku, Borneo, South Sulawesi (most known in Luwu Regency) and Sumatra in the form of papeda. In Palembang, sago is one of the ingredients to make pempek. In Brunei, it is used for making the popular local dish called the ambuyat. It is also used commercially in making noodles and white bread. Sago starch can also be used as a thickener for other dishes. It can be made into steamed puddings such as sago plum pudding.\nIn Malaysia, the traditional food \"keropok lekor\" (fish cracker) uses sago as one of its main ingredients. To make keropok lekor in Losong in Kuala Terengganu, each kilogram of fish meat is mixed with half a kilogram of fine sago, with a little salt added for flavour. Tons of raw sago are imported each year into Malaysia to support the keropok lekor industry.\nIn 1805, two captured crew members of the shipwrecked schooner \"Betsey\" were kept alive until their escape from an undetermined island on a diet of sago.\nAny starch can be pearled by heating and stirring small aggregates of moist starch, producing partly gelatinized dry kernels that swell but remain intact on boiling. Pearl sago closely resembles pearl tapioca. Both are typically small (about 2\u00a0mm diameter) dry, opaque balls. Both may be white (if very pure) or colored naturally gray, brown or black, or artificially pink, yellow, green, etc. When soaked and cooked, both become much larger, translucent, soft and spongy. Both are widely used in Indian, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan cuisine in a variety of dishes and around the world, usually in puddings. In India, it is used in a variety of dishes such as desserts boiled with sweetened milk on occasion of religious fasts.\nThe Penan people of Borneo consume sago from Eugeissona palms as their staple carbohydrate.\nTextile production.\nSago starch is also used to treat fiber in a process is called sizing, which makes fibers easier to machine. The process helps to bind the fiber, give it a predictable slip for running on metal, standardize the level of hydration of the fiber and give the textile more body. Most of the natural based cloth and clothing has been sized; this leaves a residue which is removed in the first wash.\nOther uses.\nBecause many traditional people rely on sago palm as their main food staple and because supplies are finite, in some areas commercial or industrial harvesting of wild stands of sago palm can conflict with the food needs of local communities.\nResearch is conducted to potentially make use of the waste from the sago palm industry as an adsorbent for cleaning up oil spills.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Circumscription of the subclass will vary with the taxonomic system being used; the only requirement being that it includes the family Rosaceae.\nUnder Phylocode, Rosidae is a clade defined as the most inclusive crown clade containing \"Rosa cinnamomea\", but not \"Berberidopsis corallina\" nor \"Dillenia indica\" nor \"Gunnera manicata\" nor \"Helianthus annuus\" nor \"Saxifraga mertensiana\" nor \"Stellaria media\" nor \"Viscum album\".\nA well-known example of Rosidae as governed by the ICN was in the Cronquist system. In the 1981, original, version of that system, the circumscription was as follows.\nThe Phylocode definition includes Crossosomatales, Geraniales, Myrtales, Fabidae (Celastrales, Cucurbitales, Fabales, Fagales, Huaceae, Oxalidales, Malpighiales, Rosales and Zygophyllales), Malvidae (Brassicales, Huerteales, Malvales, and Sapindales) as they are defined in the APG III system. This definition was formulated in 2007, and is agnostic on the inclusion or exclusion of Picramniales and Vitales. Since 2007, the phylogenetic positions of Picramniales and Vitales have been clarified. The position of Picramniales as sister to Malvidae sensu stricto requires it to be included among the rosids. Vitales is sister to the clade of all that must be included in the rosids and its inclusion is optional. In APG III, it was included.\nThere is considerable overlap between the two definitions. Some apparent differences are the result of more broadly drawn orders in the second. Apiales, Cornales, Proteales and Santalales, and parts of Rafflesiales (sensu Cronquist) are excluded from the second, and many groups from Cronquist's Hamamelidae and Dillenidae are included.\nIn both senses, the term \"rosid\" applies, as an adjective and noun, to members of the group. In the APG III system, which eschewed formal botanical names between the ranks of class and order, the term \"rosids\" is used to define an informal clade corresponding to Rosidae as defined in the Phylocode.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Vatican-based Institute for the Works of Religion, commonly known as the \"Vatican Bank\", was Banco Ambrosiano's main shareholder.\nBefore 1981.\nThe Banco Ambrosiano was founded in Milan in 1896 by Giuseppe Tovini, a Catholic lawyer and banker from Valle Camonica, and was named after Saint Ambrose, the fourth century archbishop of the city. Tovini's purpose was to create a Catholic bank as a counterbalance to Italy's jewish banks, and its goals were \"serving moral organisations, pious works, and religious bodies set up for charitable aims.\" The bank came to be known as the \"priests' bank\"; one chairman was Franco Ratti, nephew to Pope Pius XI. In the 1960s, the bank began to expand its business, opening a holding company in Luxembourg in 1963 which came to be known as Banco Ambrosiano Holding. This was under the direction of Carlo Canesi, then a senior manager, and from 1965 chairman. His deputy was Roberto Calvi.\nIn 1971, Calvi became general manager, and in 1975 he was appointed chairman. Calvi expanded Ambrosiano's interests, including the creation of off-shore companies in the Bahamas and South America; a controlling interest in the Banca Cattolica del Veneto; and funds for the publishing house Rizzoli to finance the \"Corriere della Sera\" newspaper (giving Calvi control behind the scenes for the benefit of his associates in the P2 masonic lodge). Calvi was a friend of American Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, president of the Istituto per le Opere di Religione (the formal name of the Vatican Bank), and involved both the IOR and Marcinkus in his dealings. \nAmbrosiano provided funds for political parties in Italy, and for both the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua and for its Sandinista opposition. There are rumours that it provided money for Solidarity in Poland. At Lugano, , which was founded in 1957 with Dr. August Gansser-Burckhardt as president, became Banco Ambrosiano's Swiss arm in 1963 with Swiss managers and a 45% stake indirectly through the Banco Ambrosiano Holding S. A., Luxembourg, which Banco Ambosiano held a 70% stake, and was the linchpin of Calvi's offshore system with branches established in Nassau (Bahamas) and Luxembourg in the 1970s and after its failure Sumitomo Bank obtained in 1984 and added the Monaco branch in 1994.\nCalvi used his complex network of overseas banks and companies to move money out of Italy, to inflate share prices, and to secure massive unsecured loans. In 1978, the Banca d'Italia (Bank of Italy) produced a report on Ambrosiano that predicted future disaster and led to criminal investigations. Soon afterward the investigating Milanese magistrate, Alessandrini, was killed by a left-wing terrorist group, while the Bank of Italy official who superintended the inspection, Mario Sarcinelli, was imprisoned on charges that were later dismissed.\nAfter 1981.\nIn 1981, police raided the office of Propaganda Due to apprehend the Worshipful Master Licio Gelli and uncover further evidence against Roberto Calvi. Calvi was sentenced to four years prison. He was released pending appeal and retained his position at the bank. Carlo de Benedetti of Olivetti bought into the bank and became deputy chairman, only to leave two months later after receiving Mafia threats and a lack of co-operation from Calvi. His replacement, longtime employee Roberto Rosone, was wounded in a Mafia shooting. The criminal organization responsible was the \"Banda della Magliana\" (Magliana Gang) which had taken over Rome's underworld in the late 1970s, and has been linked to political events of the \"anni di piombo\" (years of lead).\nIn 1982 the bank was unable to account for $1.287 billion (equivalent to $ in present-day terms). Calvi fled the country on a false passport, and Rosone arranged for the Bank of Italy to take over. Calvi's personal secretary, Graziella Corrocher, left a note denouncing Calvi before leaping to her death from her office window. Calvi's body was found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London on June 18.\nDuring July 1982, funds to the off-shore interests were cut off, leading to their collapse, and in August the bank was replaced by the Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano under Giovanni Bazoli. Pope John Paul II pledged full transparency regarding the bank's links to the Vatican and brought in lay bankers including German financial expert Hermann Abs, a move that was publicly criticized by Simon Wiesenthal, due to Abs' role as top banker to Nazi Germany from 1938 to 1945. There was much argument over who should take responsibility for losses incurred by the Old Ambrosiano's off-shore companies, and the Holy See (Vatican) eventually agreed to pay out a substantial sum without accepting liability.\nIn April 1992, Carlo De Benedetti, former deputy chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, and 32 other people were convicted of fraud by a Milan court in connection with the bank's collapse. Benedetti was sentenced to six years and four months in prison. His sentence was overturned in April 1998 by the Court of Cassation.\nIn 1994, former Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi was indicted in the Banco Ambrosiano case, along with Licio Gelli, head of Propaganda Due, and former Justice minister Claudio Martelli. In April 1998, the Court of Cassation confirmed Licio Gelli's 12-year sentence for the Ambrosiano crash.\nClearstream scandal.\nJust before the media revealed the Ambrosiano scandal, G\u00e9rard Soisson, the manager of the transaction clearing company Clearstream, was found dead in Corsica, two months after Ernest Backes' dismissal from Clearstream in May 1983. Banco Ambrosiano was one of the many banks to have unpublished accounts in Clearstream. Backes, formerly the third-ranking officer of Clearstream and a primary source for Denis Robert's book on Clearstream's scandal, \"Revelation$\", claims he \"was fired because (he) knew too much about the Ambrosiano scandal. When Soisson died, the Ambrosiano affair wasn't yet known as a scandal. (After it was revealed) I realized that Soisson and I had been at the crossroads. We moved all those transactions known later in the scandal to Lima and other branches. Nobody even knew there was a Banco Ambrosiano branch in Lima and other South American countries.\"\nAs of 2005, the Italian justice has opened up again the investigation concerning the murder of Roberto Calvi, Ambrosiano's chairman, but it asked the support of Ernest Backes and will investigate Gerard Soisson's death, according to Lucy Komisar. Licio Gelli, the headmaster of P2 Masonic Lodge, and the mafioso Giuseppe \"Pippo\" Cal\u00f2 are being prosecuted for the assassination of Roberto Calvi.\nFalklands war involvement.\nFrance prohibited deliveries of Exocet AM39 missiles purchased by Peru to avoid the possibility of Peru giving them to Argentina, because they knew that payment would be made with a credit card from the Central Bank of Peru, but British intelligence had detected that the guarantee was a deposit of two hundred million dollars from the Banco Ambrosiano Andino, an owned subsidiary of the Banco Ambrosiano. An Italian investigation into Propaganda Due's involvement in the arms trade uncovered a contract for 52 Exocets signed by Carlos Alberto Corti, an Argentinian naval officer and member of P2.\nRoberto Calvi's 1982 murder.\nDavid Yallop popularized a conspiracy theory that Calvi, with the assistance of Propaganda Due, may have been responsible for the death of Pope John Paul I, who was planning a reform of Vatican finances.\nCalvi's family maintains that he was an honest man manipulated by others. According to the magistrates who indicted Propanda Due's leader, Licio Gelli, and Sicilian Mafia boss, Giuseppe Cal\u00f2, for Calvi's murder, Gelli would have ordered his death for embezzling his and the mafia's money, while the mafia wanted to prevent him revealing how Calvi helped its money laundering.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The north end is in the City of London near the Inns of Court and Temple Church, along with Blackfriars station. The south end is in the London Borough of Southwark, near the Tate Modern art gallery and the Oxo Tower. Opened in the 1860s, it replaced an earlier bridge from the 1760s.\nHistory.\nThe first fixed crossing at Blackfriars was a long toll bridge designed in an Italianate style by Robert Mylne and constructed with nine semi-elliptical arches of Portland stone. Beating designs by John Gwynn and George Dance, it took nine years to build, opening to the public in 1769. It was the third bridge across the Thames in the then built-up area of London, supplementing the ancient London Bridge, which dated from several centuries earlier, and Westminster Bridge. It was originally named \"William Pitt Bridge\" (after the Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder) as a dedication, but its informal name relating to the precinct within the City named after the Blackfriars Monastery, a Dominican priory which once stood nearby, was generally adopted. It was later made toll free.\nThe City of London Corporation was responsible for promoting it and the location between the other two bridges was chosen because it was realised that the disused wharfage of the lower River Fleet from the Thames to what became Ludgate Circus would allow access into the north bank without unduly disrupting the neighbourhood; hence its name of New Bridge Street. The Fleet can be seen discharging into the Thames at its north side. By taking an access road from its southern landing to a junction with the routes created to simplify passage between those bridges to its east and west to the south it would also add to those improvements. This created the junction at St George's Circus between Westminster Bridge Road, Borough Road and the later named Blackfriars Road which crossed the largely open parish of Christchurch Surrey. The continuation to the south at the major junction at Elephant and Castle is therefore named London Road.\nAlthough it was built of Portland stone the workmanship was very faulty. Between 1833 and 1840 extensive repairs were necessary, until at last it was decided to build a new bridge on the same site, which coincided with the creation of the Thames Embankment's junction with the new Queen Victoria Street and required a major reconfiguration.\nThe original Blackfriars Bridge was dismantled in 1860. P.A. Thom &amp; Company won the contract for the bridge's reconstruction, and they placed an order with Lloyds, Foster and Company for the required ironwork. However, P.A. Thom encountered difficulties in finding stable foundations for the bridge, which ultimately led to financial troubles. As a result, Lloyds, Foster and Company went bankrupt, suffering a loss of \u00a3250,000 on the project. The metalwork for the bridge was ultimately constructed by The Patent Shaft and Axletree Company, Wednesbury, following their acquisition of Lloyds, Foster and Company.\nThe present bridge which on 6 November 1869 was opened by Queen Victoria is long, consisting of five wrought iron arches built to a design by Joseph Cubitt. Cubitt also designed the adjacent rail bridge (now demolished) and it was a condition that the spans and piers of the two bridges be aligned. Like its predecessor it is owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. The Blackfriars and Southwark Bridges Act 1867 put the full length and its southern end within the city's borders, in the parish of St Anne Blackfriars, and not in the adjoining borough of Southwark. Due to the volume of traffic over the bridge, it was widened between 1907 and 1910, from to its present .\nOn 14 September 1909 a tram line was opened across the newly widened bridge by the Lord Mayor of London, George Wyatt Truscott. It closed on 5 July 1952.\nThe bridge attracted some international attention in June 1982, when the body of Roberto Calvi, a former chairman of Italy's largest private bank, was found hanging from one of its arches with five bricks and around $14,000 in three different currencies in his pockets. Calvi's death was initially treated as suicide, but he was on the run from Italy accused of embezzlement and in 2002 forensic experts concluded that he had been murdered by the Mafia, to whom he was indebted. In 2005, five suspected members of the Mafia were tried in a Rome court for Calvi's murder, but all were acquitted in June 2007 for lack of evidence.\nDecorations.\nOn the piers of the bridge are stone carvings of water birds by sculptor John Birnie Philip. On the East (downstream) side (i.e. the side closer to the Thames Estuary and North Sea), the carvings show marine life and seabirds; those on the West (upstream) side show freshwater birds \u2013 reflecting the role of Blackfriars as the tidal turning point.\nOn the north side of the bridge is a statue of Queen Victoria (funded by Sir Alfred Seale Haslam), to whom the bridge was dedicated.\nAt the north end of the bridge is a commemorative plaque documenting the bridge's history, including its reopening in 1909 by Lord Mayor Truscott, accompanied by a relief of the coat of arms of the City of London Corporation.\nThe ends of the bridge are shaped like a pulpit in a reference to Black Friars.\nRailway station.\nThe bridge gave its name to Blackfriars Bridge railway station on the southern bank which opened in 1864 before closing to passengers in 1885 following the opening of what is today the main Blackfriars station. Blackfriars Bridge station continued as a goods stop until 1964 when it was completely demolished, and much of it redeveloped into offices.\nThe River Fleet empties into the Thames under the north end of Blackfriars Bridge. The structure was given Grade II listed status in 1972.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 1774 the new bridge was mentioned in a popular song in Charles Dibdin's opera \"The Waterman\", referring to the boatmen who used to carry fashionable folks to Vauxhall Gardens and Ranelagh Gardens.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA Bailey bridge constructed over the River Rhine at Rees, Germany, in 1945 by the Royal Canadian Engineers (R.C.E.) was named \"Blackfriars Bridge\", and, at 558\u00a0m (1814\u00a0ft) including the ramps at each end, was the longest Bailey bridge then constructed.\nIn Neil Gaiman's \"Neverwhere\", \"Blackfriars Bridge\" was named as the home of an unknown order of monks who held the key to an angelic prison. The bridge is also featured in the lyrics of the song \"The Resurrectionist\" by the Pet Shop Boys.\nIn Louis A. Meyer's \"Bloody Jack: Being An Account of the Curious Adventures of Mary \"Jacky\" Faber, Ship's Boy\", Jacky is introduced as an orphan in early 19th-century London who lives with her orphan gang under Blackfriars Bridge.\nThe bridge appears during the opening sequence of the film \"Happy-Go-Lucky\", where the main character rides across it on a bicycle. In the 1998 spy film \"The Avengers\", the bridge is destroyed by a tornado caused by a weather-changing machine built by a mad scientist when he causes a hurricane over London.\nThe bridge was featured in the film \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" (2007). The Order of the Phoenix passes under it on their flight from number four, Privet Drive to Grimmauld Place.\nIn Terry Gilliam's \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\" (2009), Heath Ledger's character Tony is found hanging under the Blackfriars Bridge, described by Terry Gilliam as \"an homage to Roberto Calvi\".\nIn Cassandra Clare's book series \"The Infernal Devices\", Tessa Gray and Jem Carstairs meet at the bridge every year from 1878 to 2008 except for 1941 as it was deemed too dangerous due to World War II. They also get married there.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nThe many difficulties encountered and innovations used in building the first Blackfriars Bridge 1759\u201369 are described in:"}

It resembles an English Foxhound but is slightly smaller, though not as small as a Beagle. The breed has been used since the mid 13th century.\nDescription.\nAppearance.\nThe Harrier is similar to the English Foxhound, but smaller. Harriers stand between 19 and 21\u00a0inches at the shoulder, and adults weigh between 45 and 65\u00a0lbs. They do shed, have short hair and hanging ears, and come in a variety of color patterns. A humorous description of a Harrier is that of \"a Beagle on steroids\", despite its resemblance to an English Foxhound. It is a muscular hunting hound with a small, hard coat. It has large bones for stamina and strength. The Harrier is slightly longer than tall, with a level topline. The tail is medium-length, carried high, but is not curled over the back. The skull is broad with a strong square muzzle. The rounded ears are pendant, and the eyes are either brown or hazel. The wide nose is black. The expression is mellow when the dog is relaxed and alert when he is excited. The teeth should meet in a scissors or level bite. The feet are tight and cat-like, and the front toes may turn inward.\nTemperament.\nThe Harrier is cheerful, sweet-tempered, tolerant of people, and it is excellent with children. This pack dog is good with other dogs, but should be supervised with non-canine pets unless it is raised with them from puppyhood. It prefers life in a pack with people, dogs, or both. This active dog likes to go exploring, sniffing, and trailing, so be sure to keep it on a leash or in a safe enclosed area. Some Harriers like to bay.\nHealth.\nThis breed's lifespan is generally 12\u201315 years. Hip dysplasia is known to occur in this breed.\nCare.\nThe coat needs only occasional brushing to remove dead hair.\nExercise.\nThe Harrier requires daily exercise, such as long vigorous walks or runs. Without appropriate exercise, the Harrier can become hyperactive, overweight and/or destructive. While this dog was bred to run and work all day long and cannot be satisfied by a completely sedentary lifestyle, they adapt very well to the average home.\nHistory.\nSources have widely conflicting stories about the origins of this breed. According to one, the earliest Harrier types were crossed with Bloodhounds, the Talbot Hound, and even the Basset Hound. According to another, the breed was probably developed from crosses of the English Foxhound with Fox Terrier and Greyhound. Yet another regards the Harrier as simply a bred-down version of the English Foxhound.\nIn any case, today's Harrier is between the Beagle and English Foxhound in size and was developed primarily to hunt hares, though the breed has also been used in fox hunting. The name, \"Harrier\", reveals the breed's specialty - compare \"harehound\". The Harrier has a long history of popularity as a working pack-dog in England.\nThe Harrier is the most commonly used hound by hunts in Ireland, with 166 harrier packs, 37 of them mounted packs and 129 of them foot packs, spread throughout the country. In Ireland it is used to hunt both foxes and hares, with some packs hunting mainly foxes.\nHarriers in UK\nIn the Victorian era, the Harrier was included in the original Kennel Club Studbook (1874) as one of the only 40 breeds recognised by the document. The last time Harriers were shown at a Kennel Club show or entered in their Studbook was in 1915. The last time they were shown at Crufts was 1898.\nIn 1891, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles (AMHB) was founded and registered 107 Harrier packs.\nFrom the First World War until after the Second there was a significant decline not just in Harriers but in most breeds, working dogs and pet populations. Only Foxhounds received government support for food in order to manage the fox population. At the same time many privately owned Harrier packs hunted by the owners of large estates were disbanded. In the sporting Gazette of 1898 we read of the \u2018Annual Leicester sale of Harriers\u2019 at which the entire pack of 34 couple (68 hounds) belonging to the late Mr Carleton-Cowper was sold for a total of \u00a3550.10s. A further sale only a week later offered for sale 39 couple of hounds from three different packs. Such Harrier sales continued until soon after the WWII.\nIt was over ten years after the war that the MFHA with the support of the Kennel Club took a firm stand to ensure that in terms of breeding there was a clear distinction between Harriers bred for the purpose of Hunting and those bred for the bench shows and pet owners.\nBy the middle of the 20th Century, there were fewer than 50 Harrier packs and the AMHB banned the sale of registered Harriers and strictly controlled the breeding of dogs and sale of Harriers outside other registered packs, the result being that they all but disappeared outside the hunting community. The Kennel Club eventually withdrew breed recognition in the early 1970s.\nBy 2013, there were only 18 Harrier Packs in the UK. In 2022, there were only 13 Harrier Packs (eight Stud Book, five West Country): there were now under 750 Harriers left in the UK, and only 300 West Country Harriers left in the world.\nIn France and the USA, Harrier enthusiasts kept the breed going. France is the only nation with two dogs achieving world recognition with Iran des Coutas in 1974 and Alicien in 2011. In the USA, Emmy was BOB at Westminster Dog Show in 2018 and Whisper was BOB in 2020.\nThe Harrier was recognised again by the UK Kennel Club in January 2020. As of 2022, there were over 50 pure bred Harriers registered with the KC.\nAt the World Dog Show 2021, British Harrier Ross Demon for https:// was awarded the title of World Winner becoming only the third Harrier to be awarded this title (Iran de Coutas WW1974, Alician WW2011). In October 2021, the UK Kennel Club released the Interim Breed Standard, which meant that for the first time in 50 years Harriers could be shown under Kennel Club rules. The first KC show was the Ladies' Kennel Association in Birmingham on December 11, 2021 where 18 Harriers were entered in AVNSC (Any Variety Not Separately Classified). \n Best Of Breed was \"Evforce Miss Havoc\" \"at Henissy\". Best Puppy was \"Evforce Golden Agent\". Best Veteran was \"Frenzy\" \"at Henissy\". Crufts 2022 was to see 19 Harriers being shown for the first time in 124 years on Friday 11th. In 2022, The Best of Breed title was awarded to \"Evforce Miss Havoc at Henissy\" making her the first Harrier to be awarded Best of Breed since 1898. The Junior Clint\u00a0 \"Evforce Clint West Gunner\" was awarded Reserve Best of Breed. \"Henissy Farthing\" was awarded Reserve Best Bitch.\nIn 1885, the American Kennel Club recognized the Harrier breed of dog, classified in the Hound Group.\nThe Harrier Club of America cites the earliest description of a Harrier in \"The Chace\" (by the English poet William Somervile) which was written in 1735.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Games Boston was acquired by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment for $160 million and became a part of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (now Warner Bros. Games), the video game division of Warner Bros. Entertainment.\nHistory.\nTurbine was founded as CyberSpace, Inc. in April 1994 by Jeremy Gaffney, Jonathan Monserrat, Kevin Langevin, and Timothy Miller, some of whom were students from the Artificial Intelligence Lab at Brown University. In 1995, the company was based in Monserrat's mother's house with 12 staff members. They found an office in Providence, Rhode Island but later moved to Westwood, Massachusetts to better take advantage of the software engineers coming out of Boston's colleges. As CEO, Monsarrat used free food and office pranks to keep staff motivated.\nIn 1995, the company changed its name to Turbine Entertainment Software Corp. In 1999, the company's first game, \"Asheron's Call\", was released. It was notable for being the third 3D MMORPG, following the launch of \"Meridian 59\" and then \"EverQuest\". Its most notable feature, designed by Monsarrat, was a \"loyalty\" system giving new and experienced players incentives to work together. The Olthoi was the first monster developed for \"Asheron's Call\", designed by Joe Angell.\nAfter \"Asheron's Call\", the company went on to make a sequel, \"\", which came out in 2002 (just after the first \"Asheron's Call\" expansion). However, after only one expansion, \"Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings\" shut down in 2005. In the same year, Turbine Entertainment Software Corp. changed its name to Turbine, Inc.\nIn 2006, Turbine released '. Early reception was positive, but the game was criticised for poor solo play. In 2007, Turbine released ', which got positive reviews and was seen as a needed boost for the company.\nIn 2009, \"Dungeons and Dragons Online\" was suffering a low playerbase; in an attempt to save the game, Turbine replaced the traditional monthly subscription model with a free to play one. In 2010, Turbine also moved \"The Lord of the Rings Online\" (which was then on its second expansion) to a free-to-play model. In the same year, Turbine was purchased by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment for $160 million.\nIn 2012, Turbine brought back \"Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings\".\nThe game's development of \"Infinite Crisis\" ended on August 14, 2015.\nThe company was hit with layoffs for three years consecutively starting from 2014. While Turbine's focus was shifted to develop free-to-play mobile games by Warner Bros. in 2016, the servers for both \"The Lord of the Rings Online\" and \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online\" were maintained and supported.\nBy December 2016, Turbine was no longer involved with the development of \"The Lord of the Rings Online\" or \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online\". Instead a spin-off studio under the name of \"Standing Stone Games\" was formed to take over further development of the game, with game staff moving from Turbine to the new studio. As part of this transition, Daybreak Game Company became the new publisher, taking over from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. \"Asheron's Call\" IP remained as a property of Turbine, and the servers for both \"Asheron's Call\" and \"Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings\" were closed on January 31, 2017.\nBy November 2018, the studio was rebranded and became WB Games Boston.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Antlers are a single structure composed of bone, cartilage, fibrous tissue, skin, nerves, and blood vessels. They are generally found only on males, with the exception of reindeer/caribou. Antlers are shed and regrown each year and function primarily as objects of sexual attraction and as weapons.\nEtymology.\nAntler comes from the Old French \"antoillier \"(see present French : \"Andouiller\", from\" ant-, \"meaning before,\" oeil, \"meaning eye and\" -ier\", a suffix indicating an action or state of being) possibly from some form of an unattested Latin word \"*anteocularis\", \"before the eye\" (and applied to the word for \"branch\" or \"horn\").\nStructure and development.\nAntlers are unique to cervids. The ancestors of deer had tusks (long upper canine teeth). In most species, antlers appear to replace tusks. However, one modern species (the water deer) has tusks and no antlers and the muntjacs have small antlers and tusks. The musk deer, which are not true cervids, also bear tusks in place of antlers.\nIn contrast to antlers, horns\u2014found on pronghorns and bovids, such as sheep, goats, bison and cattle\u2014are two-part structures that usually do not shed. A horn's interior of bone is covered by an exterior sheath made of keratin (the same material as human fingernails and toenails).\nAntlers are usually found only on males. Only reindeer (known as caribou in North America) have antlers on the females, and these are normally smaller than those of the males. Nevertheless, fertile does from other species of deer have the capacity to produce antlers on occasion, usually due to increased testosterone levels. The \"horns\" of a pronghorn (which is not a cervid but a antilocaprid) meet some of the criteria of antlers, but are not considered true antlers because they contain keratin.\nEach antler grows from an attachment point on the skull called a pedicle. While an antler is growing, it is covered with highly vascular skin called velvet, which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing bone. Antlers are considered one of the most exaggerated cases of male secondary sexual traits in the animal kingdom, and grow faster than any other mammal bone. Growth occurs at the tip, and is initially cartilage, which is later replaced by bone tissue. Once the antler has achieved its full size, the velvet is lost and the antler's bone dies. This dead bone structure is the mature antler. In most cases, the bone at the base is destroyed by osteoclasts and the antlers fall off at some point. As a result of their fast growth rate, antlers are considered a handicap since there is an immense nutritional demand on deer to re-grow antlers annually, and thus can be honest signals of metabolic efficiency and food gathering capability.\nIn most Arctic and temperate-zone species, antler growth and shedding is annual, and is controlled by the length of daylight. Although the antlers are regrown each year, their size varies with the age of the animal in many species, increasing annually over several years before reaching maximum size. In tropical species, antlers may be shed at any time of year, and in some species such as the sambar, antlers are shed at different times in the year depending on multiple factors. Some equatorial deer such as Bornean muntjacs may never shed their antlers.\nA 2019 study published in \"Science\" identified eight genes active in antler formation that are normally associated with bone cancer, particularly osteosarcoma. Additional tumor-suppressing and tumor-growth-inhibiting genes were determined to be responsible for regulating antler growth. This was taken to indicate that antler formation is more similar to a highly controlled form of cancer growth than to normal bone development.\nAntlers function as both weapons in male-male competition and as displays of sexual ornaments for females. Because mature antlers are no longer living during combat, antler fractures are incapable of being repaired following competition. A study in 2019 hypothesized that the periodic casting and regrowth of antlers might have evolved as a way to ensure the availability of complete antler sets to display each year. Antler regeneration in male deer ensures that every mating season begins on a clean slate, as an increase in branching size and complexity happens each regeneration cycle in an individual.\nMechanical properties.\nBones typically serve a structural purpose, with load bearing abilities that are greater than any other part of an animal's body. Bones typically differ in shape and properties to better fit their overall function. Antlers are not structural and typically have different properties when compared to structural bones like femurs.\nWhile antlers are classified as bone, they differ in some ways from human bones and bovine bones. Bone is characterized as being made up of primarily collagen and a mineral phase. In antlers, the mineral content is considerably lower than other examples of bone tissue, while having a high volume of collagen. This leads antlers to having lower yield strength and stiffness, but higher fracture toughness when compared to human cortical bone. Mineral content differs among species and also depends on the food availability. In recent studies, increase in mineral content has been linked to the increase in stiffness with a decrease in fracture toughness.\nFurther, bones are highly anisotropic due to their hierarchical structure. Thus, mechanical properties are highly dependent on testing conditions and directions. Due to their cylindrical shape, antlers can be tested using bending along three different orientations. Bend testing in these orientations have resulted in different mechanical properties. In samples from antler bone taken in the transverse direction, an elastic modulus of 8.92\u201310.02 GPa was reported. For the longitudinal and radial orientations, the elastic modulus was 7.19\u20138.23 and 4.01\u20134.27 GPa respectively. The transverse direction was overall found to be the stronger orientation with higher mechanical properties. The ultimate tensile strength of 262.96\u2013274.38 MPa in the transverse direction was statistically significant when compared to the longitudinal and radial directions' values of 46.91\u201348.55 and 41.75\u201343.67 MPa.\nTensile testing of antler bones has also been conducted to compare to bovine femur results. The antler samples were tested in dry and wet conditions as done in other studies. The wetness of a sample resulted in a difference in mean maximum strain: 1.46% and 2.2%, dry and wet respectively. Further, the ultimate tensile strength of wet, dry and bovine difference showed differences as well: 188 MPa, 108 MPa, and 99.2 MPa for dry, wet and bovine samples respectively. Similarly, the elastic modulus for dry samples was 17.1 GPa, 7.5 GPa for wet samples, and 17.7 GPa for bovine femur. This difference in elastic modulus is due to the difference in function of a bovine femur versus an antler. Bovine femurs must withstand greater stresses, holding up the body of the animal, whereas an antler is used for sexual selection and competition.\nFunction.\nSexual selection.\nThe principal means of evolution of antlers is sexual selection, which operates via two mechanisms: male-to-male competition (behaviorally, physiologically) and female mate choice. Male-male competition can take place in two forms. First, they can compete behaviorally where males use their antlers as weapons to compete for access to mates; second, they can compete physiologically where males present their antlers to display their strength and fertility competitiveness to compete for access to mates. Males with the largest antlers are more likely to obtain mates and achieve the highest fertilization success due to their competitiveness, dominance and high phenotypic quality. Whether this is a result of male-male fighting or display, or of female choosiness differs depending on the species as the shape, size, and function of antlers vary between species.\nHeritability and reproductive advantage.\nThere is evidence to support that antler size influences mate selection in the red deer, and has a heritable component. Despite this, a 30-year study showed no shift in the median size of antlers in a population of red deer. The lack of response could be explained by environmental covariance, meaning that lifetime breeding success is determined by an unmeasured trait which is phenotypically correlated with antler size but for which there is no genetic correlation of antler growth. Alternatively, the lack of response could be explained by the relationship between heterozygosity and antler size, which states that males heterozygous at multiple loci, including MHC loci, have larger antlers. The evolutionary response of traits that depend on heterozygosity is slower than traits that are dependent on additive genetic components and thus the evolutionary change is slower than expected. A third possibility is that the costs of having larger antlers (resource use, and mobility detriments, for instance) exert enough selective pressure to offset the benefit of attracting mates; thereby stabilizing antler size in the population.\nProtection against predation.\nIf antlers functioned only in male\u2013male competition for mates, the best evolutionary strategy would be to shed them immediately after the rutting season, both to free the male from a heavy encumbrance and to give him more time to regrow a larger new pair. Yet antlers are commonly retained through the winter and into the spring, suggesting that they have another use. Wolves in Yellowstone National Park are 3.6 times more likely to attack individual male elk without antlers, or groups of elk in which at least one male is without antlers. Half of all male elk killed by wolves lack antlers, at times in which only one quarter of all males have shed antlers. These findings suggest that antlers have a secondary function in deterring predation.\nFemale antlers in reindeer.\nReindeer (\"Rangifer tarandus)\" are the only cervid species that inhabit the Arctic and subarctic regions of the globe, yet their most striking distinction is the presence of pedicles after birth and antlers in both males and females. One possible reason that females of this species evolved antlers is to clear away snow so they can eat the vegetation underneath. Another possible reason is for female competition during winter foraging. Espmark (1964) observed that the presence of antlers on females is related to the hierarchy rank and is a result of the harsh winter conditions and the female dominated parental investment. Males shed their antlers prior to winter, while female antlers are retained throughout winter. Also, female antler size plateaus at the onset of puberty, around age three, while males' antler size increases during their lifetime. This likely reflects the differing life history strategies of the two sexes, where females are resource limited in their reproduction and cannot afford costly antlers, while male reproductive success depends on the size of their antlers because they are under directional sexual selection. In other species of deer, the presence of antlers in females indicates some degree of intersex condition, the frequency of which has been seen to vary from 1.5% to 0.02%.\nAntenna for hearing.\nIn moose, antlers may act as large hearing aids. Equipped with large, highly adjustable external ears, moose have highly sensitive hearing. Moose with antlers have more sensitive hearing than moose without, and a study of trophy antlers with an artificial ear confirmed that the large flattened (palmate) antler behaves like a parabolic reflector.\nDiversification.\nThe diversification of antlers, body size and tusks has been strongly influenced by changes in habitat and behavior (fighting and mating).\nHomology and evolution of tines.\nAntlers originated once in the cervid lineage. The earliest fossil remains of antlers that have been found are dated to the early Miocene, about 17 million years ago. These early antlers were small and had just two forks. As antlers evolved, they lengthened and gained many branches, or tines, becoming more complex. The homology of tines has been discussed since the 1900s and has provided great insight into the evolutionary history of the Cervidae family.\nRecently, a new method to describe the branching structure of antlers was developed. It is by using antler grooves, which are formed on the surface of antlers by growth, projecting the branching structure on the burr circumference, and making diagrams. Comparing the positional order among species on the diagram, the tine on the same position is homologous. The study revealed that three-pointed structures of Capreolinae and Cervini are homoplasious, and their subclades gained synapomorphous tines.\nExploitation by other species.\nEcological role.\nDiscarded antlers represent a source of calcium, phosphorus and other minerals and are often gnawed upon by small animals, including squirrels, porcupines, rabbits and mice. This is more common among animals inhabiting regions where the soil is deficient in these minerals. Antlers shed in oak forest inhabited by squirrels are rapidly chewed to pieces by them.\nTrophy hunting.\nAntlered heads are prized as trophies with larger sets being more highly prized. The first organization to keep records of sizes was Rowland Ward Ltd., a London taxidermy firm, in the early 20th century. For a time only total length or spread was recorded. In the middle of the century, the Boone and Crockett Club and the Safari Club International developed complex scoring systems based on various dimensions and the number of tines or points, and they keep extensive records of high-scoring antlers. Deer bred for hunting on farms are selected based on the size of the antlers.\nHunters have developed terms for antler parts: beam, palm, brow, bez or bay, trez or tray, royal, and surroyal. These are the main shaft, flattened center, first tine, second tine, third tine, fourth tine, and fifth or higher tines, respectively. The second branch is also called an advancer.\nIn Yorkshire in the United Kingdom roe deer hunting is especially popular due to the large antlers produced there. This is due to the high levels of chalk in Yorkshire. The chalk is high in calcium which is ingested by the deer and helps growth in the antlers.\nShed antler hunting.\nGathering shed antlers or \"sheds\" attracts dedicated practitioners who refer to it colloquially as \"shed hunting\", or \"bone picking\". In the United States, the middle of December to the middle of February is considered shed hunting season, when deer, elk, and moose begin to shed. The North American Shed Hunting Club, founded in 1991, is an organization for those who take part in this activity.\nIn the United States in 2017 sheds fetch around US$10 per pound, with larger specimens in good condition attracting higher prices. The most desirable antlers have been found soon after being shed. The value is reduced if they have been damaged by weathering or being gnawed by small animals. A matched pair from the same animal is a very desirable find but often antlers are shed separately and may be separated by several miles. Some enthusiasts for shed hunting use trained dogs to assist them. Most hunters will follow \"game trails\" (trails where deer frequently run) to find these sheds or they will build a shed trap to collect the loose antlers in the late winter/early spring.\nIn most US states, the possession of or trade in parts of game animals is subject to some degree of regulation, but the trade in antlers is widely permitted. In the national parks of Canada, the removal of shed antlers is an offense punishable by a maximum fine of C$25,000, as the Canadian government considers antlers to belong to the people of Canada and part of the ecosystems in which they are discarded.\nCarving for decorative and tool uses.\nAntler has been used through history as a material to make tools, weapons, ornaments, and toys. It was an especially important material in the European Late Paleolithic, used by the Magdalenian culture to make carvings and engraved designs on objects such as the so-called B\u00e2ton de commandements and the \"Bison Licking Insect Bite\". In the Viking Age and medieval period, it formed an important raw material in the craft of comb-making. In later periods, antler\u2014used as a cheap substitute for ivory\u2014was a material especially associated with equipment for hunting, such as saddles and horse harness, guns and daggers, powder flasks, as well as buttons and the like. The decorative display of wall-mounted pairs of antlers has been popular since medieval times at least.\nThe Netsilik, an Inuit group, made bows and arrows using antler, reinforced with strands of animal tendons braided to form a cable-backed bow. Several Indigenous American tribes also used antler to make bows, gluing tendons to the bow instead of tying them as cables. An antler bow, made in the early 19th century, is on display at Brooklyn Museum. Its manufacture is attributed to the Yankton Sioux.\nThrough history large deer antler from a suitable species (e.g. red deer) were often cut down to its shaft and its lowest tine and used as a one-pointed pickax.\nCeremonial roles.\nAntler headdresses were worn by shamans and other spiritual figures in various cultures, and for dances; 21 antler \"frontlets\" apparently for wearing on the head, and over 10,000 years old, have been excavated at the English Mesolithic site of Starr Carr. Antlers are still worn in traditional dances such as Yaqui deer dances and carried in the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance.\nDietary usage.\nIn the velvet antler stage, antlers of elk and deer have been used in Asia as a dietary supplement or alternative medicinal substance for more than 2,000 years. Recently, deer antler extract has become popular among Western athletes and body builders because the extract, with its trace amounts of IGF-1, is believed to help build and repair muscle tissue; however, one double-blind study did not find evidence of intended effects.\nElk, deer, and moose antlers have also become popular forms of dog chews that owners purchase for their pet canines.\nShed hunting with dogs.\nDogs are sometimes used to find shed antlers. The North American Shed Hunting Dog Association (NASHDA) has resources for people who want to train their dogs to find shed antlers and hold shed dog hunting events.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Buchanan", "text": "American economist and Nobel Laureate (1919\u20132013)\nJames McGill Buchanan Jr. ( ; October 3, 1919 \u2013 January 9, 2013) was an American economist known for his work on public choice theory originally outlined in his most famous work, \"The Calculus of Consent\", co-authored with Gordon Tullock in 1962. He continued to develop the theory, eventually receiving the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1986. Buchanan's work initiated research on how politicians' and bureaucrats' self-interest, utility maximization, and other non-wealth-maximizing considerations affect their decision-making. He was a member of the Board of Advisors of The Independent Institute as well as of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a member of the Mont Pelerin Society (MPS) and MPS president from 1984 to 1986, a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the Cato Institute, and professor at George Mason University.\nEarly life and education.\nBuchanan was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the eldest of the three children of James and Lila (Scott) Buchanan. His paternal grandfather, John P. Buchanan, was governor of Tennessee from 1891 to 1893. According to Buchanan's 1992 memoir, when his father, James Buchanan Sr., married in 1918 and began his family he borrowed heavily to mechanize and improve the farm, including the acquisition of a herd of Jersey cattle. The Buchanan farm suffered during the 1920s\u2014by the time James Buchanan Jr. was old enough to work on the farm, all the work was done either manually or with mules and horses. Buchanan described his life on the farm as \"genteel poverty\" with neither indoor plumbing nor electricity. The house did contain his grandfather's library of books on politics. Unlike in other farm families where children regularly stayed home to help as farm labor, his mother insisted he never miss a day of school. While completing his first university degree in 1940 at Middle Tennessee State Teachers College he continued to live at home and work on the farm. In 1941 he completed his M.S. at the University of Tennessee.\nWorld War II.\nBuchanan attended the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School in New York starting in September 1941. He was assigned to Honolulu, Hawaii in March 1942, where he served as an officer on Admiral Chester W. Nimitz's operations planning staff in the United States Navy.\nBuchanan attributed his dislike of what he considered \"Eastern elites\" to his six months of Navy officer training in New York in 1941. He believed that there was overt discrimination against young men from the South or West in favor of those who had attended what he called establishment universities in the Northeast. In a 2011 interview, Buchanan said that out of twenty \"boys from the establishment universities, 12 or 13 were picked against a background of a total of 600 [men].\" He was completing his last month of training in New York during the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Buchanan said that \"in balance\" his work in operations planning during the war was \"easy.\" He was discharged in November 1945.\nEducation.\nWith the support of his wife, Ann Bakke, and the generous G.I. Bill education subsidy available to war veterans, Buchanan applied to graduate school. In his 1992 autobiography, Buchanan said that when he began his graduate studies in 1945 at the University of Chicago, he was unaware of how market-oriented the Chicago school of economics was. He stated that he was essentially socialist until he enrolled in a course taught by Frank Knight. Knight, who also taught leading economic thinkers such as Milton Friedman and George Stigler at the University of Chicago, was a founding member of the Mont Pelerin Society. Within six weeks of starting his studies, Buchanan said he was \"converted into a zealous advocate of the market order\". Knight became Buchanan's \"de facto\" PhD supervisor, and his 1948 dissertation, \"Fiscal Equity in a Federal State\", was heavily influenced by Knight. Buchanan did not consider himself as belonging to the Austrian or the Chicago schools of economics. But he was a member of the Mont Pelerin Society, and served as its president from 1984 to 1986 just before he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He did share many of their common beliefs. As Buchanan puts it: \"I certainly have a great deal of affinity with Austrian economics and I have no objections to being called an Austrian. Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises might consider me an Austrian but, surely some of the others would not.\" Buchanan went on to say that: \"I didn't become acquainted with Mises until I wrote an article on individual choice and voting in the market in 1954. After I had finished the first draft I went back to see what Mises had said in \"Human Action\". I found out, amazingly, that he had come closer to saying what I was trying to say than anybody else.\"\nIt was also at Chicago that he first read and found enlightening the work of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Photographs of Knight and Wicksell hung on his office walls ever after.\nAcademic career.\nAfter completing his PhD in 1948, Buchanan taught at the University of Tennessee as associate professor and later full professor from 1948 until 1951. He was a professor of economics at Florida State University from 1951 until 1956 and served for two years as the department chair. From 1955 to 1956 he was a Fulbright Scholar in Italy.\nHe taught at the University of Virginia from 1956 to 1968, UCLA from 1968 to 1969, and Virginia Tech from 1969 to 1983, where he held the title Distinguished Professor of Economics. In 1998, Buchanan returned to Virginia Tech as a Distinguished Emeritus Professor of Economics and Philosophy where he contributed in organizing and providing funds for workshops, symposium, and lectures, including the annual James M. Buchanan lectures.\nIn 1983 he became a professor at George Mason University where he remained until his retirement, after which he continued with emeritus status.\nProfessional organizations.\nThomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy.\nIn 1956 Buchanan and G. Warren Nutter approached the president of the University of Virginia to discuss the creation of a new school within the university, \"The Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy and Social Philosophy\". Nutter, who studied under Friedman and Knight at the University of Chicago in the late 1940s, was working at that time under the sponsorship of the Brookings Institution's National Bureau of Economic Research (INBR) on his 1962 book \"The Growth of Industrial Production in the Soviet Union\". It was Thomas Jefferson who founded the University of Virginia in 1819 in Charlottesville, Virginia as a public research university. The next year the school was founded with the intention of preserving a \"social order built on individual liberty, and . . . as an educational undertaking in which students will be encouraged to view the organizational problems of society as a fusion of technical and philosophical issues.\"\nOne of the center's early publications that reached a wider audience was a 1959 report Buchanan co-authored with Nutter, \"The Economics of Universal Education\". In it they wrote that the, \"case for universal education is self-evident: a democracy cannot function without an informed and educated citizenry. . . . If education is to be universal, compulsion must be exercised by government\u2014that is, by the collective organ of society\u2014since some parents might choose to keep their children out of school. For similar reasons, minimum standards of education must be determined by government. Otherwise, the requirement of education is empty and meaningless.\" Buchanan was not against \"state participation in education\" although he strongly opposed \" state monopoly of education\".\nIts publication provided the center and its authors, their first opportunity to be involved in a major public policy issue related to constitutional reform. A March 12, 1959 \"Charlottesville Daily Progress\" editorial called for reform of Virginia's constitution that would recognize \"both the need for universal education and the right of the individual to freedom of choice in the education of his children.\" Georgetown University historian, James H. Hershman, said the wording seems to be from \"The Economics of Universal Education\". In a 2017 CATO Institute's Libertarianism.org podcast, Richard E. Wagner, who studied under Buchanan in the 1960s and maintained a 50-year friendship with him, said that Buchanan was an \"egalitarian\" and had no objection to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education U.S. Supreme Court decision that introduced desegregation in public schools. Wagner said that while Buchanan opposed segregated schools at the time, he also believed in decentralization and parental and student choice within a liberal orientation of people being able to develop their talents and abilities. Hershman wrote the \"Encyclopedia Virginia\"'s \"Massive Resistance\" article,' and his 1978 PhD dissertation was on the massive resistance strategy\u2014a Virginia state government strategy adopted in 1956 to block the\u00a0desegregation of public schools led by Harry F. Byrd Sr., who coined the term. In a 2020 article, Hershman examined Buchanan's actions in the spring of 1959 within the context of the massive resistance policy. By the time Buchanan became involved, there was already a groundswell of protests against desegregation based on constitutional arguments, states' rights, and even some arguments from the Chicago school of economics. The Virginia school crisis offered Buchanan a \"major opportunity\" of promoting \"libertarian economic and social ideas.\" The Buchanan and Nutter report proved most useful just before an April 16, 1959, public hearing on a proposed constitutional change. In order to counter the argument that a \"private system was unfeasible and that any weakening of public education would damage the state's economy overall and discourage new industries from coming to Virginia\", supporters asked Buchanan and Nutter to write a shorter summary of their February report. They published two articles on the report in the Richmond \"Times-Dispatch\" on April 12 and 13. While Buchanan's personal views on race were beside the point, according to Hershman, the \"massive resistance private school initiative\" had provided an \"opportunity to \"create a functioning alternative to the existing public system\", to \"promote his libertarian education doctrines, as an example to showcase those ideas\". Hershman wrote that it did not seem to concern Buchanan that the libertarian doctrines would perpetuate segregation. Buchanan was on the wrong side of history. The school crisis brought in a power shift in the state of Virginia from a \"rural, courthouse elite to that of an urban, business elite\".\nIn later years, Buchanan no longer held the same ideas on school vouchers as those expressed in the 1959 report. He cautioned in a 1984 letter to the Institute for Economic Affairs' Arthur Seldon that a state-sponsored unregulated voucher system from tax revenues to avoid the \"evils of state monopoly\" of the education system, could have the unintended consequence of the \"evils of race-class-cultural segregation.\" The voucher system could result in recreating the exclusive membership-only system for elites. While vouchers would ideally promote market competition while also providing benefits of \"exposure to other races, classes and cultures\", Buchanan warned that this may not happen in practice.\nPublic Choice Society and \"Public Choice\" journal.\nWith the publication of \"The Calculus of Consent\" in 1962 and Mancur Olson's\u00a0\"Logic of Collective Action\" in 1965, there was growing interest in public choice theory. Tullock and Buchanan applied for and received a National Science Foundation grant to organize a preliminary research meeting in Charlottesville in 1963 with about twenty people from economics, philosophy, and political science including Olson, William H. Riker, Vincent Ostrom, Anthony Downs, Duncan Black, Roland McKean, Jerome Rothenberg, and John Rawls (author of the influential 1971 \"A Theory of Justice\"). They created a Committee for the Study of Non-Market Decision Making, which later became the Public Choice Society. They wanted to focus on how choices and \"decisions were made outside of a private market context\". As a follow-up, they launched a journal with Tullock as editor called \"Papers on Non-market Decision Making\". Tullock remained as editor until 1990. They had several follow-up meetings, including one in Chicago in 1967. Members were dissatisfied with the title and it was changed to \"Public Choice\".\nVirginia school of political economy.\nBuchanan remained at the University of Virginia until 1968. The work of Buchanan, Nutter, and other colleagues including Tullock, Stigler, Ronald Coase, Alexandre Kafka, and Leland B. Yeager later came to be seen as the start of the Virginia school of political economy as separate from the Chicago school of economics. Buchanan stated that Mancur Olson came up with the term some time after the Center for Study of Public Choice was founded at Virginia Tech. In a 1997 interview with \"Reason\", Coase discussed the atmosphere in the university's economics department in the 1960s, in which he and Buchanan, Tullock, and Nutter felt that their work was considered to be \"disreputable\" and they were considered to be \"right-wing extremists.\" Coase stated that he believed there was general suspicion towards anyone who supported an unregulated free market at that time.\nCenter for Study of Public Choice.\nIn 1969, Buchanan, Tullock, and Charles J. Goetz established the Center for Study of Public Choice at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) in Blacksburg, Virginia with Buchanan as its first director.\nIn 1983, Buchanan relocated the entire Center for Study of Public Choice unit, which included its seven faculty members to George Mason University (GMU) in Fairfax, Virginia. Buchanan complained to then-GMU economics department chair Karen Vaughn that VPI was losing its status as unique center for public choice. Buchanan was offered an annual salary of over $100,000 at George Mason, At the time, George Mason was a relatively unknown state university, having just gained independent status from the University of Virginia in 1972. Buchanan was drawn to GMU's leadership. Vaughn stated that she believed the addition of the Center contributed to GMU's rapid growth. Over the next decades, GMU became the largest public university in Virginia.\nEconomist James C. Miller III, who served as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and as Budget Director for then-US president Ronald Reagan consulted with Buchanan, Tullock, and Tollison at the center. From 1998 to 2002 the Center functioned as part of James M. Buchanan Center for Political Economy.\nOther activities and associations.\nBuchanan was associated with the Indianapolis-headquartered Liberty Fund, a free-market think tank which was founded in 1960 by Pierre F. Goodrich. Goodrich became a member of the Mont Pelerin Society in 1953 and had formed friendships with Hayek, Mises, Friedman and others. The Liberty Fund hosted conferences and symposiums on Buchanan's economic policy, liberalism and liberty. The entire collection of his publications are hosted on the Online Library of Liberty (OLL) site. The Liberty Fund also published \"The Collected Works of James Buchanan\".\nMajor research themes.\nBuchanan broad themes include public finance then public goods, public choice, and public philosophy. In the late 1940s and 1950s he investigated voting and other topics not usually studied in economics. Buchanan began to break from \"disciplinary constraints\" and examine problems from other disciplines such as political science.\nIn 1948, Buchanan first read the Swedish economist, Wicksell's \"Finanztheoretische Untersuchungen\" 1896 essay, \"A New Principle of Just Taxation.\" He translated it from German and in his 1986 Nobel Prize lecture Buchanan said that Wicksell was an \"important precursor of modern public-choice theory.\"had informed his own concept of unanimity-voting. Wicksell investigated a mechanism for voting how public goods could be financed in order to ensure that the tax burden was fairly distributed. Wicksell applied the benefit principle to taxation. By using the mechanism of unanimity-voting, everyone involved would have a guarantee of receiving \"benefits commensurate to their tax cost from any public good\". Wicksell said that no would be able to complain if he were able to receive \"a benefit which he himself considers to be (greater or at least) as great as the price he has to pay\".\nBuchanan said that his 1949 paper, \"The Pure Theory of Government Finance: A Suggested Approach\" published in the Journal of Political Economy he was influenced by Wicksell. to improve the rules and structure of politics, and particularly to recognize that politicians behave like most people, according to their own self-interests. It was a way of thinking about politics that was based on common sense reality, not romanticism. In that paper he called on economists to clarify their own assumptions about politics and to think about their political models before talking about \"good taxation\" and \"good spending.\" \"The Pure Theory of Government Finance: A Suggested Approach\" published in the Journal of Political Economy It contained core ideas that Buchanan continued to develop over his career which spanned six decades, according to his biographer Richard E. Wagner. In his 1989 address on Buchanan's contributions, Tony Atkinson said that it \"reads like a manifesto for his life's work.\" In it Buchanan clarified that the democratic state is not a single decision-making unit as in a monarchy. In democratic societies, the state can only represent the collective will of the sum of its individual members.\nHis 1950 article, \"Federalism and Fiscal Equity\"\u2014reprinted in Richard A. Musgrave 1959 \"Readings in the economics of taxation\"\u2014was described as a \"pioneering\" paper by Musgrave. During the recession of 1960\u20131961, Buchanan and Musgrave served on a Brookings Institution's National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) advisory committee on the needs, sources, and utilization of public finances. Brookings is a respected think tank that has a long history of producing influential commissioned reports for the United States government. In their discussion on equity objectives of fiscal policy, Musgrave cited Buchanan's recommendation that the central fiscal policy should consider individuals, not the \"states\", as a matter of equity. The requirement of horizontal equity\u2014the \"principle that equals should be treated equally\"\u2014 is more meaningful than that of vertical equity\u2014the \"requirement of differential treatment of unequals\".\nIn 1955 Buchanan spent the year in Italy reading the works of the neoclassical economist Maffeo Pantaleoni (1857\u00a0\u20131924) and his followers\u2014Antonio De Viti De Marco and Vilfredo Pareto\u2014, who are part of the Italian school of public finance theory. They are considered to be a major influence on Buchanan's work. He considered them to be among the \"intellectual forefathers of the modern public choice theory\". In his \"Public Principles of Public Debt\" published in 1958, Buchanan acknowledged that \"the Italian approach to the whole problem of public debt was instrumental in shaping my views\". rigorous analysis of the theory of logrolling, macroeconomics, constitutional economics, and libertarian theory. He was the first anglophone economist to focus on this and included their work in his chapter, \"The Italian Tradition in Fiscal Theory\", in his 1960 textbook \"Fiscal Theory and Political Economy\". He discussed collective decision-making in public finance\u2014the role of the government in the state's economy and fiscal theory.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s as Buchanan was developing his own thoughts on the concept of the state, Kenneth Arrow published his influential 1951 monograph, \"Social Choice and Individual Values\". which was the catalyst for debate on social choice. The monograph was based on ideas Arrow first developed in 1948 as a RAND Corporation intern and in his PhD dissertation in 1950 combining social ethics, voting theory and economics in his social choice theory. Arrow examined the role of individual preferences in the process of collective decision-making regarding aggregate or group preferences, for example, in voting and establishing underlying constitutions for the common good. Arrow concluded that it was generally impossible to assess the \"common good\", for example, the design of a social welfare function through a fair ranked voting electoral system because individual preferences within the aggregate differ. The paradox is the impossibility of majority voting yielding a stable result or pareto efficiency with existing rules of the game. Buchanan critiqued Arrow's impossibility theorem or Arrow's paradox. The thesis in Arrow's 1951 book that \"majority rule would not give you a political equilibrium\" created a lot of debate. Buchanan responded that his idea was anti-majoritaire\u2014if that is what the preferences are, then in a democracy we ought to have a rotation, so there is not just one majority simply ruling. Most political scientists in the 1950s believed in majoritarian democracy as the ideal parliamentary model. Buchanan's ideal was more of a constitutional structure. Buchanan described himself as a constitutional political economist who writes from an economic point of view within a structure of American politics that aligns with James Madison's vision of the ideal democratic parliamentary model, which was not a majority democracy. In public choice theory, Buchanan raises concerns about minorities being exploited under permanent majorities\nWhile in Italy on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1956 - 1957 he became aware of how his generation of Americans\u2014those born in the decades after WWI\u2014had a view of politics that was too romanticized. Italians took a more skeptical, realistic, and critical view of politics. When he returned to the US in 1956, he carried that skepticism with him. In 1958, Tullock took time off from his position at the U.S. Department of State that he had held since 1949, to do research at the University of Virginia focused on majority rule. Buchanan described Tullock as a natural realist about politics; his skepticism had increased in Washington.\nBuchanan met Tullock, who had a law degree but no formal training in economics, when Tullock accepted a postdoctoral position at the University of Virginia in 1958. Although Tullock's PhD was in law and he had little formal training in economics, the two complemented each other; Buchanan as the philosopher and Tullock the scientist. Together, they set out to provide an \"optimal set of the political rules of the game\".\nIn 1962, Buchanan and Tullock published \"Calculus of Consent, Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy\", in which they first outlined public choice theory. Buchanan said he was motivated to write \"The Calculus of Consent\", because he had a sense that those who should know what democracy actually was, did not. He started to question taxation, expenditure decisions, budgets and the political process. In the same year Buchanan began drafts of his 1967 book, \"Public Finance in Democratic Process: Fiscal Institutions and the Individual Choice\" in which he applied ideas from pioneering ideas from the public choice school of analysis developed in \"Calculus of Consent\" to public finance. Buchanan received research support and assistance from the Brookings Institution for the book. In it he analyzed how individual behavior affected fiscal institutions in situations related to collective choice, for example, the relationship between income tax and the public use of economic resources. He said that the primary way in which individuals can make collective choices is by voting.\nIn 1967 Buchanan co-authored \"Public Debt in a Democratic Society\" with Wagner. Buchanan considered his work on public debt as an important extension of his work on public choice theory. Public choice theory examined political decision-making structures as applied to budget policy, specifically as related to fiscal deficit. Buchanan said that there was government overreach in totalitarian regimes but also in the 1960s in Western democratic welfare-state nations, such as President Lyndon B. Johnson's \"Great Society\" programs designed to eliminate poverty and racial injustice. As more people became critical of government programs during the 1970s, in his view public choice theory provided some common sense answers, as opposed to romance. He said that he did not want to \"lead the way\", he wanted to provide a way for people to \"interpret better what they were seeing\". He described how politicians provide their constituents with programs that benefit them, paying for the new programs with deficit to avoid having to raise taxes to pay for them in order to remain in office. Public choice policies called for constitutional amendments to prevent the deficit from accelerating even more. In his 1986 chapter \"Budgetary Bias in Post-Keynesian Politics\" in \"Deficits\", he wrote, \"The most elementary prediction from public choice theory is that in the absence of moral or constitutional constraints democracies will finance some share of public consumption from debt issue rather than from taxation and that, in consequence, spending rates will be higher than would accrue under budget balance.\"\nIn 1968, Buchanan left the University of Virginia and spent a year at the University of California, Los Angeles. He published \"The Demand and Supply of Public Goods\", in which he described public finance methods using consensus politics developed by Wicksell and his student Erik Lindahl (1891 \u2013 1960) within the framework of their concept of the ideal state. Hayek had introduced their work to anglophone economists in his 1941 \"Pure Theory of Capital\" written while he was at the London School of Economics (LSE). Buchanan traced the history of public goods theory to Wicksell and re-examined the Wicksellian unanimous solution in voting. He discussed tax shares as a variable in public finance theory and potential outcomes of public choice by majority rule. The Lindahl tax share on public goods paid by individuals is based on the marginal benefits derived from the goods\u2014a system designed to maximize efficiency for the individual while also providing optimal public good. The rate or share of taxation is related to the willingness to pay. Buchanan discussed challenges to achieving a Pareto-optimal position from Lindahl's concept of public goods, such as free riders.\nBuchanan's 1969 work \"Cost and Choice\" is often overlooked for its contributions in defining the parameters of opportunity cost. In it, he writes that the costs to individuals determine what the price of a good or service is. For example, the physical work that is required to hunt an animal as well as the price of the tools necessary to hunt it and the time spent hunting all play a factor in the price an individual places on the meat. The asking price of the meat will vary from person to person because the input costs required for each person are not the same.\nIn his 1964 article \"What Should Economists Do?\", which was based on his 1963 address to the Southern Economic Association (SEA), Buchanan distinguished between economics and politics. The former studies \"the whole system of exchange relationships\" while the latter studies \"the whole system of coercive or potentially coercive relationships\". One of Buchanan's definitive statements on the re-orientation of the two academic disciplines of economics and political science was found in this 1963 SEA address.\nBuchanan told his contemporaries in the field of economics that Adam Smith's statement in his 1776 \"An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\" that the human \"propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another\" is what political economy is all about. Economists should therefore focus on the politics of exchange not on attempting to engineer efficient allocations of resources.\nMichael Munger described three elements of Buchanan's concept of public choice theory\u2014behavioural symmetry, methodological individualism, and politics as exchange, or \"politics without romance\". In their article on Buchanan's politics as exchange, they described him as a classical liberal, who also incorporated rational choice theory, and individual utility maximization in his analyses. The ultimate exchange process is not based on some romantic notion of public service that Buchanan roundly rejected. \"Politics of exchange implies a shared exchange relationship or enterprise that is crucial as a way of \"justifying political coercion of one person over another\". Buchanan encouraged individuals to be skeptical about bureaucrats' and politicians' motivations and behaviour. Buchanan said that the \"politics as exchange\" contract on which the constitution is based precedes any economic enterprise. Trade in goods and services can only be undertaken in an orderly fashion if a legal system in already in place, one that includes limits on the powers of governments. Politics of exchange can then be described as cooperative, the contract between \"nonmarket institutions and the mechanism of coercion is collective\". Politics as exchange is a way of justifying coercion by providing a means for a change that is mutually beneficial, attaining pareto efficiency through cooperation, where societal improvement is possible when a change results in harming no one but helping someone.\nIn his 1966 publication \"Public Finance in a Democratic Process\" Buchanan began to develop applications based on \"The Calculus of Consent\" using a multidisciplinary approach through the lens of both economics and politics .\nBuchanan was largely responsible for the rebirth of political economy as a scholarly pursuit. He emphasized that public policy cannot be considered solely in terms of distribution, but is instead always a matter of setting the rules of the game that engender a pattern of exchange and distribution. His work in public choice theory is often interpreted as the quintessential instance of economics imperialism; however, Amartya Sen has argued that Buchanan should not be identified with economics imperialism, since he has done more than most to introduce ethics, legal political thinking, and indeed social thinking into economics. Crucial to understanding Buchanan's system of thought is the distinction he made between politics and policy. Politics is about the rules of the game, where policy is focused on strategies that players adopt within a given set of rules. \"Questions about what are good rules of the game are in the domain of social philosophy, whereas questions about the strategies that players will adopt given those rules is the domain of economics, and it is the play between the rules (social philosophy) and the strategies (economics) that constitutes what Buchanan refers to as constitutional political economy\".\nIn his 1975 book, \"The Limits of Liberty: Between Anarchy and Leviathan\", which has been described as his \"magnum opus\", Buchanan examined the concept of a social contract. In \"The Limits of Liberty\" Buchanan did support some redistribution; his proposed social contract of a \"productive\" state includes tax-financed goods and some social insurance. He felt this would have unanimous agreement. In the summer of 1975 at a Liberty Fund conference in Ohio with most of the economists in attendance saying there should be no estate tax, Buchanan passionately disagreed. He thought that there should be a 100% marginal tax on all estates over a relatively modest amount, to prevent an aristocracy from forming in America and to ensure equal opportunity.\nBuchanan was a vocal critic of the 1994 David Card and Alan B. Krueger's minimum wage study. Contrary to the consensus at the time, they found that \"the increase in the minimum wage increased employment.\" In a 1996 response in the \"Wall Street Journal\", Buchanan wrote, \"Just as no physicist would claim that \"water runs uphill,\" no self-respecting economist would claim that increases in the minimum wage increase employment. [...] Fortunately, only a handful of economists are willing to throw over the teaching of two centuries; we have not yet become a bevy of camp-following whores.\"\nPublic choice theory.\nBuchanan is the chief architect and the leading researcher of public choice theory which was first outlined in his most well-known work, \"The Calculus of Consent\". Over many decades, Buchanan developed the theoretical formulation which straddled both economics and political science and became known as \"The New Political Economy\" or \"Public Choice\" for which he was honored with the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Sir Anthony (Tony) Atkinson said that one of Buchanan's major contributions was clarifying two levels of public choice\u2014the constitutional level which is where the rules of the game are set, and the postconstitutional level, where the game is played within the constitutional rules.\nIn \"The Calculus of Consent\", Buchanan and Tullock cited Swedish economist Knut Wicksell's standpoint on public choice in their argument for the need for unanimous agreement on constitutional rules. Anthony Atkinson cited the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences describing the significant role of Wicksell in the development of Buchanan's thinking. It was Buchanan who translated Wicksell's \"A New Principle of Just Taxation\" from German in 1958. Within the framework of public choice, they described the potential for logrolling as enhancing rather than reducing welfare. Logrolling refers to politicians' vote-trading on provisions as part of an endgame of achieving their political or economic goals.\nAccording to a 1992 journal article by George Mason University economists, Alexander Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen, the precursor to Buchanan and Tullock's public choice theory is found in the work of John C. Calhoun. Tabarrok, who is the director of the Center for Study of Public Choice, and Cowen, Director of the Mercatus Center and a CSPC faculty member, said that Calhoun's political philosophy writings, as developed in his 1851 \"A Disquisition on Government\", proposed the rule by unanimity to reform the constitution, which as it then existed according to Calhoun, had resulted in a form of democracy that did not sufficiently protect liberty. In his analysis of Calhoun's work through the Virginia political economy perspective, the Heartland Institute's Alexander Salter wrote that Buchanan's project regarding generality norm is supported by Calhoun's concurrent majority developed in the \"Disquisition\".\nIn the \"Dictionary of Economics,\" Tullock said that public choice theory applies methodologies from economics to the study of political behavior. Public choice theory assumes that people are mainly guided by self-interest, including politicians, bureaucrats, and government officials. Public choice theory focuses on democratic decision-making process within the political realm. Buchanan used both fields of economics and political science to help develop his theory of public choice. The same principles used to interpret people's decisions in a market setting are applied to voting, lobbying, campaigning, and even candidates. Buchanan maintains that a person's first instinct is to make their decisions based upon their own self-interest, which varied from previous models where government officials acted in constituents' best interest. Buchanan explains public choice theory as \"politics without romance\" because, he says, many of the promises made in politics are intended to appear concerned with the interest of others, but in reality, are the products of selfish ulterior motives. According to this view, political decisions, on both sides of the voting booth, are rarely made with the intention of helping anyone but the one making the decision. Buchanan argues that the actions of voters and politicians can be predicted by analyzing their behaviors.\nIn the 1960s when Buchanan first began to formulate his public choice theory, he was one of the few, if not the only economist, who was critical of Keynesian economics, which had become widely accepted in the United States in the 1960s and resulted in a shift in towards governance through \"macro-economic engineering\". Keynes had written his classic and influential \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\" in 1938, but there was a lag between its publication and the widespread adoption of his ideas. By 1965, \"Time\" magazine featured the phase \"We are all Keynesians now\" on its cover attributing it to Milton Friedman. Keynes promoted the use of deficit spending as a way to implement government programs in the wake of the Great Depression in the 1930s and Post-World War II. The 1977 book, \"Democracy in Deficit\", by Buchanan and co-author Richard Wagner was based on an analysis of Keynesian macroeconomic theory and policy in which they applied the basic tools of public choice theory for the first time. They found that there was a bias towards deficit spending that could be linked to the self-interest of the political agents involved.\nConstitutionalism.\nWithin constitutionalism, Buchanan worked on developing the field of constitutional economics. According to Buchanan, the ethic of constitutionalism is a key for constitutional order and \"may be called the idealized Kantian world\" where the individual \"who is making the ordering, along with substantially all of his fellows, adopts the moral law as a general rule for behavior\". Buchanan rejected \"any organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom to the citizens of this state\". This philosophical position forms the basis of constitutional economics. Buchanan believed that every constitution is created for at least several generations of citizens. Therefore, it must be able to balance the interests of the state, society, and the individual.\nThere was a long history of neoliberal economists in Chile even before Augusto Pinochet 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat that deposed President Salvador Allende. Through the 1970s and 1980s the Chilean economists known as the Chicago Boys who studied at the University of Chicago under Milton Friedman had applied his economic theories in their government positions in South America, including in the military dictatorship of Chile (1973\u20131990). The Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile of 1980 came into full force in March 1981 constitution, establishing a market-oriented model based on Chicago School and Friedman's neoliberal ideas. In Chile, Buchanan provided policy advice and his constitutional political economy arguments to Pinochet. He also allegedly provided an \"analytical defense of military rule to a predominantly Chilean audience.\" Hayek also visited Chile and Pinochet that year.\nViews on Anarchy.\nAnarchy as a theoretical ideal.\nBuchanan had strong views on anarchy as a means of running society. Going so far as to say in his 1975 book The Limits of Liberty \u201cThe ideal society is anarchy, in which no man or group of men coerces any other.\u201d (page 92). This paints a picture of Buchanan and what he believes, in a perfect world, no man should be forced to do anything. Grounded in reality, Buchanan also wrote, \u201cAnarchy is the ideal for ideal men; for ordinary men, some government is necessary.\u201d This gives credence to the idea that while anarchy sounds good in a vacuum, in real world applications there needs to be at least some kind of government control for the protection of society and its members. Scholars later debated between themselves on the validity of these ideas, and if Buchanan would be considered an anarchist or not. Some scholars, such as Peter Boettke and Rosolino Candela, made the case for Buchanan being closer to anarcho-capitalism than many other economists. The argument being that he treated anarchy as a moral idea over just a rhetorical trick. Other scholars such as Viktor Vanberg, and Roger Congleton, do not believe that Buchanan was truly an anarchist but said that he used it as a thought experiment, in order to put tight limits on government, but never calling for its full removal.\nLegacy.\nMiddle Tennessee State University (MTSU) Honors College's Buchanan Fellowship program, named for Buchanan, is awarded to 20 first-year student at MTSU annually. The Buchanan Transfer Fellowship program is awarded to 30 transfer students each year. Additionally, MTSU's Buchanan Family Reading Room at the James E. Walker Library was funded with a gift by Buchanan's family to honor Buchanan and the contributions of the family as a whole to the state of Tennessee.\nIn his 2017 publication, Richard Wagner described how Buchanan's scholarship continues to influence law, ethics, political science, and economics in the 21st century.\nNicol\u00e1s Cachanosky and Edward J. Lopez suggest that Buchanan's research can inform work on trade restrictions and populism in the twenty-first century.\nBuchanan is a central figure in the 2017 nonfiction book \"Democracy in Chains\" by Duke University professor and historian Nancy MacLean. MacLean traced Buchanan's concept of power to the 1950s and 1960s. Buchanan had become concerned that the federal government was channeling too many resources to the public. As he witnessed the federal government increasing its power, Buchanan sought ways to protect the wealthy from being forced to support programs that seemed to him to be a move towards socialism. MacLean described how Buchanan and other libertarians seek to protect capitalism by preventing government overreach. MacLean described Buchanan's concept of human nature as \"dismal\" and that he believed that politicians and government workers are motivated by self-interest and that government would continue to increase in scale and power unless there were constitutional limits in place. MacLean raised concerns that Buchanan and Charles Koch mutually supported one another to the detriment of democratic participation for all. Koch provided millions in funding to libertarian university programs and Buchanan provided the intellectual arguments from political economy to place limits on democracy. MacLean's book became a catalyst for discussion online and in journals. \"The New York Review of Books\", \"Boston Review of Books\", and \"Los Angeles Review of Books\" gave the book positive reviews. Her critics include David Bernstein who wrote a series of \"Washington Post\" opinion pieces as part of the \"Volokh Conspiracy\" blog. In a 2018 \"Journal of Economic Literature\" review of MacLean's book, Jean-Baptiste Fleury and Alain Marciano said that MacLean misunderstood public choice theory and that she had overlooked some significant aspects of Buchanan's biography and thinking and had over-interpreted others. MacLean, who spent years studying Buchanan's copious archives after his death, says that the influence of Buchanan's six decades of work on modern conservatism is not well-enough appreciated or understood by liberal politicians, economists, and journalists.\nPersonal life and death.\nBuchanan met Ann Bakke, who was of Norwegian descent, in Hawaii while they were both serving in the military during World War II. Bakke served with the Army Air Transport Command at Hickam Field as a secretary.\nThey married on October 5, 1945, in San Francisco. Ann died in 2005. They had no children.\nIn a 1986 \"Chicago Tribune\" interview Buchanan said, \"I want a private sphere in which I am protected, where nobody can invade...I don't feel the need to be a part of a community or a team.\" According to a \"Washington Post\" obituarist he was not known for his warm personality, and that even his \"staunchest admirers admitted that he was forbidding.\" Even though he had a long career at George Mason University in Fairfax, Buchanan and his wife chose to spend most of their time a four-hour drive away on their 400-acre working farm near Blacksburg. They had vegetable gardens and raised cattle.\nBuchanan was an Atheist and antagonistic to religion.\nBuchanan died at their farm on January 9, 2013, at age 93.\n\"The New York Times\" obituary said that the Nobel Prize-winning economist who championed public choice theory influenced a \"generation of conservative thinking about deficits, taxes and the size of government\". The \"Badische Zeitung\" (Freiburg) called Buchanan, who showed how politicians undermine fair and simple tax systems, the \"founder of the new political economy\".\nSelected publications.\nA listing of Buchanan's publications from 1949 to 1986 can be found at the https://, 1987, 89(1), pp.\u00a017\u201337.\nWorks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
