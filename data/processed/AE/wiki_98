Traditionally, the coconuts are sun-dried, especially for export, before the oil, also known as copra oil, is pressed out. The oil extracted from copra is rich in lauric acid, making it an important commodity in the preparation of lauryl alcohol, soaps, fatty acids, cosmetics, etc. and thus a lucrative product for many coconut-producing countries. The palatable oil cake, known as copra cake, obtained as a residue in the production of copra oil is used in animal feeds. The ground cake is known as coconut or copra meal.\nProduction.\nCopra has traditionally been grated and ground, then boiled in water to extract coconut oil. It was used by Pacific island cultures and became a valuable commercial product for merchants in the South Seas and South Asia in the 1860s. Nowadays, coconut oil (70%) is extracted by crushing copra; the by-product is known as copra cake or copra meal (30%).\nThe coconut cake which remains after the oil is extracted is 18\u201325% protein, but contains so much dietary fiber it cannot be eaten in large quantities by humans. Instead, it is normally fed to ruminants.\nThe production of copra \u2013 removing the shell, breaking it up, drying \u2013 is usually done where the coconut palms grow. Copra can be made by smoke drying, sun drying, or kiln drying. Hybrid solar drying systems can also be used for a continuous drying process. In a hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night time. Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight. Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove mold-creating contaminants. After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total). Sun drying is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture. This process can also be done in reverse order: partially drying the copra in the kiln, and finishing the process with sunlight. Starting with sun drying requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with kiln-drying can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun.\nIn India, small but whole coconuts can be dried over the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball. Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white. Coconut meat can be dried using direct heat and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire. The smoke residue can help preserve the half-dried meat but the process overall suffers from unpredictable results and the risk of fires.\nWhile there are some large plantations with integrated operations, copra remains primarily a smallholder crop. In former years copra was collected by traders going from island to island and port to port in the Pacific Ocean but South Pacific production is now much diminished, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\nEconomics.\nCopra production begins on coconut plantations. Coconut trees are generally spaced apart, allowing a density of 100\u2013160 coconut trees per hectare. A standard tree bears around 50\u201380 nuts a year, and average earnings in Vanuatu (1999) were US$0.20 per kg (one kg equals 8 nuts)\u2014so a farmer could earn approximately US$120 to US$320 yearly for each planted hectare. Copra has since more than doubled in price, and was quoted at US$540 per ton in the Philippines on a CIF Rotterdam basis (US$0.54 per kg) by the \"Financial Times\" on 9 November 2012.\nIn 2017 the value of global exports of copra was $145-146 Million. The largest exporter was Papua New Guinea with 35% of the global total, followed by Indonesia (20%), Solomon Islands (13%) and Vanuatu (12%). The largest importer of copra is the Philippines, which imports $93.4 Million or 64% of the global total. A very large number of small farmers and tree owners produce copra, which is a vital part of their income.\nAflatoxin susceptibility.\nCopra is highly susceptible to the growth of molds and their production of aflatoxins if not dried properly. Aflatoxins can be highly toxic, and are among the most potent known natural carcinogens, particularly affecting the liver. Aflatoxins in copra cake, fed to animals, can be passed on to milk or meat from livestock, leading to human illnesses.\nAnimal feed.\nCopra meal is used as fodder for horses and cattle. Its high oil and protein levels are fattening for stock. The protein in copra meal has been heat treated and provides a source of high-quality protein for cattle, sheep and deer, because it does not break down in the rumen.\nCoconut oil can be extracted using either mechanical expellers or solvents (hexane). Mechanically expelled copra meal is of higher feeding value, because it contains typically 8\u201312% oil, whereas the solvent-extracted copra meal contains only 2\u20134% oil. Premium quality copra meal can also contain 20\u201322% crude protein, and &lt; 20ppb aflatoxin.\nHigh-quality copra meal contains &lt; 12% non-structural carbohydrate (NSC), which makes it well suited for feeding to horses that are prone to ulcers, insulin resistance, colic, tying up, and acidosis.\nShipment.\nCopra has been classed with dangerous goods due to its spontaneously combustive nature. It is identified as a Division 4.2 substance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The molecular structure can be described as a neopentane with one hydrogen atom in each methyl group replaced by a hydroxyl (\u2013OH) group. It is therefore a polyol, specifically a tetrol. \nPentaerythritol is a white solid. It is a building block for the synthesis and production of explosives, plastics, paints, appliances, cosmetics, and many other commercial products.\nThe word pentaerythritol is a blend of \"penta-\" in reference to its five carbon atoms and \"erythritol\", which also possesses 4 alcohol groups.\nSynthesis.\nPentaerythritol was first reported in 1891 by German chemist Bernhard Tollens and his student P. Wigand. It may be prepared via a base-catalyzed multiple-addition reaction between acetaldehyde and 3 equivalents of formaldehyde to give pentaerythrose (CAS: 3818-32-4), followed by a Cannizzaro reaction with a fourth equivalent of formaldehyde to give the final product plus formate ion.\nUses.\nPentaerythritol is a versatile building block for the preparation of many compounds, particularly polyfunctionalized derivatives. applications include alkyd resins, varnishes, polyvinyl chloride stabilizers, tall oil esters, antioxidants (e.g. Anox 20). Such derivatives are found in plastics, paints, cosmetics, and many other products. Relevant to resins, pentaerythritol is a precursor to other polyol, such as dipentaerythritol:\nEsters of pentaerythitol are biodegradable, and they are used as transformer oils. Due to a very high flash point they also find some use in lubricating gas turbines.\nEster derivatives.\nPentaerythritol is a precursor to esters of the type C(CH2OX)4. Such derivatives are pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), a vasodilator and explosive, the trinitrate derivative pentrinitrol (Petrin), the tetraacetate normosterol (PAG), and the polymer cross-linking agents pentaerythritol tetraacrylate and pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate).\nA linear polymer which can be described as a (spiro) orthocarbonate ester of pentaerythritol, whose formula could be written as , was synthesized in 2002.\nFire retardants.\nPentaerythritol is used as a fire retardant, such as in plastics and intumescent paints and coatings. It releases water upon heating and leaves a deposit of thermally insulating char.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The U.S. Census Bureau is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce and its director is appointed by the president of the United States. As of September 19, 2025, George Cook is the acting director of the U.S. Census Bureau.\nThe Census Bureau's primary mission is conducting the U.S. census every ten years, which allocates the seats of the U.S. House of Representatives to the states based on their population. The bureau's various censuses and surveys help allocate over $675 billion in federal funds every year and it assists states, local communities, and businesses in making informed decisions. The information provided by the census informs decisions on where to build and maintain schools, hospitals, transportation infrastructure, and police and fire departments.\nIn addition to the decennial census, the Census Bureau continually conducts over 130 surveys and programs a year, including the American Community Survey, the U.S. Economic Census, and the Current Population Survey.&lt;ref name=\"USCB DOC-D1026 QVC Manual 01/03/09\"&gt;USCB DOC-D1026 QVC Manual 01/03/09&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Economic Census occurs every five years and reports on American business and the American economy in order to plan business decisions. Furthermore, economic and foreign trade indicators released by the federal government typically contain data produced by the Census Bureau.\nLegal mandate.\nArticle One of the United States Constitution (section II) directs the population be enumerated at least once every ten years and the resulting counts used to set the number of members from each state in the House of Representatives and, by extension, in the Electoral College. The Census Bureau now conducts a full population count every ten years in years ending with a zero and uses the term \"decennial\" to describe the operation. Between censuses, the Census Bureau makes population estimates and projections.\nIn addition, census data directly affects how more than $400 billion per year in federal and state funding is allocated to communities for neighborhood improvements, public health, education, transportation and more. The Census Bureau is mandated with fulfilling these obligations: the collecting of statistics about the nation, its people, and economy. The Census Bureau's legal authority is codified in Title 13 of the United States Code.\nThe Census Bureau also conducts surveys on behalf of various federal government and local government agencies on topics such as employment, crime, health, consumer expenditures, and housing. Within the bureau, these are known as \"demographic surveys\" and are conducted perpetually between and during decennial (10-year) population counts. The Census Bureau also conducts economic surveys of manufacturing, retail, service, and other establishments and of domestic governments.\nFrom 1790 through 1840, the census was taken by marshals of the judicial districts. The Census Act of 1840 established a central office which became known as the Census Office. Several acts followed that revised and authorized new censuses, typically at the 10-year intervals. In 1902, the temporary Census Office was moved under the Department of Interior, and in 1903 it was renamed the Census Bureau under the new Department of Commerce and Labor. The department was intended to consolidate overlapping statistical agencies, but Census Bureau officials were hindered by their subordinate role in the department.\nAn act in 1920 changed the date and authorized manufacturing censuses every two years and agriculture censuses every 10 years. In 1929, a bill was passed mandating the House of Representatives be reapportioned based on the results of the 1930 census. In 1954, various acts were codified into Title 13 of the U.S. Code.\nBy law, the Census Bureau must count everyone and submit state population totals to the U.S. president by December 31 of any year ending in a zero. States within the Union receive the results in the spring of the following year.\nData collection.\nCensus regions and divisions.\nThe United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions, with nine divisions. The Census Bureau regions are widely used for data collection and analysis. The Census Bureau definition is pervasive. The territories are not included, but the District of Columbia is.\nRegional divisions used by the United States Census Bureau:\nHistory.\nThe first census was collected in 1790 and published in 1791. It was 56 pages and cost $44,377.28.\nThe current system was introduced for the 1910 census, but other ways of grouping states were used historically by the Census Bureau. The first of these was introduced after the 1850 census by statistician and later census superintendent J. D. B. De Bow. He published a compendium where the states and territories were grouped into five \"great divisions\", namely the Middle, New England, the Northwestern, the Southern, and the Southwestern great divisions. Unsatisfied with this system, De Bow devised another one four years later, with states and territories grouped into an Eastern, Interior, and Western \"great section\", each divided into a northern and southern half called \"divisions\".\nIn the following decades, several other systems were used, until the current one was introduced in 1910. This system has seen only minor changes: New Mexico and Arizona were both added to the Mountain division upon statehood in 1912, the North region was divided into a Northeast and a North Central region in 1940, Alaska and Hawaii were both added to the Pacific division upon statehood in 1959, and the North Central region was renamed the Midwest in 1984.\nUses of census data.\nMany federal, state, local and tribal governments use census data to:\nCensus data is used to determine how seats of Congress are distributed to states. Census data is not used to determine or define race genetically, biologically or anthropologically. The census data is also used by the Bureau to obtain a real-time estimate in U.S. and World Population Clock. Only people who live in the 50 states and within the District of Columbia are included in the estimation.\nData stewardship.\nThe United States Census Bureau is committed to confidentiality and guarantees non-disclosure of any addresses or personal information related to individuals or establishments. Title 13 of the U.S. Code establishes penalties for the disclosure of this information. All census employees must sign an affidavit of non-disclosure prior to employment. This non-disclosure states \"I will not disclose any information contained in the schedules, lists, or statements obtained for or prepared by the Census Bureau to any person or persons either during or after employment.\" The punishment for breaking the non-disclosure is a fine up to $250,000 or five years in prison.\nThe bureau cannot share responses, addresses or personal information with anyone, including the United States or foreign governments, or law enforcement agencies such as the IRS or the FBI or Interpol. \"Providing quality data, for public good\u2014while respecting individual privacy and, at the same time, protecting confidentiality\u2014is the Census Bureau's core responsibility\"; \"Keeping the public's trust is critical to the Census's ability to carry out the mission as the leading source of quality data about the Nation's people and economy.\" Only after 72 years does the information collected become available to other agencies or the general public. Seventy-two years was picked because usually by 72 years since the census is taken, most participants would be deceased.\nDespite these guarantees of confidentiality, the Census Bureau has some history of disclosures to other government agencies. In 1918, the Census Bureau released individual information regarding several hundred young men to the Justice Department and Selective Service system for the purpose of prosecutions for draft evasion. During World War II, the United States Census Bureau assisted the government's Japanese American internment efforts by providing confidential neighborhood information on Japanese-Americans. The bureau's role was denied for decades but was finally proven in 2007.\nUnited States census data are valuable for the country's political parties; Democrats and Republicans are highly interested in knowing the accurate number of persons in their respective districts. These insights are often linked to financial and economic strategies that are central to federal, state and city investments for locations of particular populations. Such apportionments are designed to distribute political power across neutral spatial allocations; however, \"because so much is at stake, the census also runs the risk of being politicized.\"\nSuch political tensions highlight the complexity of identity and classification; some argue that unclear results from the population data \"is due to distortions brought about by political pressures.\" One frequently used example includes ambiguous ethnic counts, which often involves underenumeration and/or undercounting of minority populations. Ideas about race, ethnicity and identity have also evolved in the United States, and such changes warrant examination of how these shifts have impacted the accuracy of census data over time.\nThe United States Census Bureau began pursuing technological innovations to improve the precision of its census data collection in the 1980s. Robert W. Marx, the Chief of the Geography Division of the USCB, teamed up with the U.S. Geological Survey and oversaw the creation of the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) database system. Census officials were able to evaluate the more sophisticated and detailed results that the TIGER system produced; furthermore, TIGER data is also available to the public. And while the TIGER system does not directly amass demographic data, as a geographic information system (GIS), it can be used to merge demographics to conduct more accurate geospatial and mapping analysis.\nIn July 2019, the Census Bureau stopped releasing new data via American FactFinder, which was decommissioned in March 2020 after 20 years of being the agency's primary tool for data dissemination. The new platform is data.census.gov.\nOngoing surveys.\nThroughout the decade between censuses, the bureau conducts surveys to produce a general view and comprehensive study of the United States' social and economic conditions. Staff from the Current Surveys Program conduct over 130 ongoing and special surveys about people and their characteristics. A network of professional field representatives gathers information from a sample of households, responding to questions about employment, consumer expenditures, health, housing, and other topics.\nSurveys conducted between decades:\nOther surveys conducted.\nThe Census Bureau also collects information on behalf of survey sponsors. These sponsors include the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the National Science Foundation (NSF), among others.\nOrganizational structure.\nSince 1903, the official census-taking agency of the United States government has been the Bureau of the Census. The Census Bureau is headed by a director, assisted by a deputy director and an executive staff composed of the associate directors.\nThe Census Bureau headquarters has been in Suitland, Maryland, since 1942. A new headquarters complex completed there in 2007 supports over 4,000 employees.\nThe bureau operates regional offices in six cities:\nNew York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, and Los Angeles. The National Processing Center is in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Additional temporary processing facilities facilitate the decennial census, which employs more than a million people. The cost of the 2000 census was $4.5 billion. During the years just prior to the decennial census, parallel census offices, known as \"Regional Census Centers\" are opened in the field office cities. The decennial operations are carried out from these facilities. The Regional Census Centers oversee the openings and closings of smaller \"Area Census Offices\" within their collection jurisdictions. In 2020, Regional Census Centers oversaw the operation of 248 Area Census Offices, The estimated cost of the 2010 census is $14.7 billion.\nOn January 1, 2013, the Census Bureau consolidated its twelve regional offices into six. Increasing costs of data collection, changes in survey management tools such as laptops and the increasing use of multi-modal surveys (i.e. internet, telephone, and in-person) led the Bureau to consolidate. The six regional offices that closed were Boston, Charlotte, Dallas, Detroit, Kansas City and Seattle. The remaining regional offices are New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, and Los Angeles.\nThe Census Bureau also runs the Census Information Center cooperative program that involves 58 \"national, regional, and local non-profit organizations\". The CIC program aims to represent the interests of underserved communities.\nComputer equipment.\nThe 1890 census was the first to use the electric tabulating machines invented by Herman Hollerith. For 1890\u20131940 details, see In 1946, knowing of the bureau's funding of Hollerith and, later, Powers, John Mauchly approached the bureau about early funding for UNIVAC development. A UNIVAC I computer was accepted by the bureau in 1951.\nHandheld computers.\nHistorically, the census information was gathered by census takers going door-to-door collecting information in a ledger. Beginning in 1970 information was gathered via mailed forms. To reduce paper usage, reduce payroll expense and acquire the most comprehensive list of addresses ever compiled, 500,000 handheld computers (HHCs) (specifically designed, single-purpose devices) were used for the first time in 2009 during the address canvassing portion of the 2010 Decennial Census Project. Projected savings were estimated to be over $1 billion.\nSecurity precautions.\nThe HHC was manufactured by Harris Corporation, an established Department of Defense contractor, via a controversial contract with the Department of Commerce. Secured access via a fingerprint swipe guaranteed only the verified user could access the unit. A GPS capacity was integral to the daily address management and the transfer of gathered information. Of major importance was the security and integrity of the populace's private information.\nSuccess and failure.\nEnumerators (information gatherers) that had operational problems with the device understandably made negative reports. During the 2009 Senate confirmation hearings for Robert Groves, President Obama's Census Director appointee, there was much mention of problems but very little criticism of the units. In rural areas, the sparsity of cell phone towers caused problems with data transmission to and from the HHC. Since the units were updated nightly with important changes and updates, operator implementation of proper procedure was imperative.\nResearch studies.\nCensus Bureau stays current by conducting research studies to improve the work that they do. Census researchers explore topics about survey innovations, participation, and data accuracy, such as undercount, overcount, the use of technologies, multilingual research, and ways to reduce costs. In addition, the Bureau pretests surveys and digital products before they are fielded and then evaluates them after they have been conducted.\nNotable figures.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n72-year rule"}

Tetryl is a sensitive secondary high explosive used as a booster, a small charge placed next to the detonator in order to propagate detonation into the main explosive charge.\nChemical properties.\nTetryl is a yellow crystalline solid powder material, practically insoluble in water but soluble in acetone, benzene and other solvents. When tetryl is heated, it first melts, then decomposes and explodes. It burns readily and is more easily detonated than ammonium picrate or TNT, being about as sensitive as picric acid. It is detonated by friction, shock, or spark. It remains stable at all temperatures which may be encountered in storage. It is generally used in the form of pressed pellets, and has been approved as the standard bursting charge for small-caliber projectiles, since it gives much better fragmentation than TNT. It has an explosive velocity of 23,600\u201323,900 feet per second (7200\u20137300\u00a0m/s). Tetryl is the basis for the service tetryl blasting caps necessary for positive detonation of TNT. A mixture of mercury fulminate and potassium chlorate is included in the cap to ensure detonation of tetryl.\nEnvironmental effect.\nThe most toxic ordnance compounds, tetryl and 1,3,5-TNB, are also the most degradable. Therefore, these chemicals are expected to be short-lived in nature, and environmental impacts would not be expected in areas that are not currently subject to chronic inputs of these chemicals. Tetryl decomposes rapidly in methanol/water solutions, as well as with heat. All aqueous samples expected to contain tetryl should be diluted with acetonitrile prior to filtration and acidified to pH &lt; 3. All samples expected to contain tetryl should not be exposed to temperatures above room temperature. In addition, degradation products of tetryl appear as a shoulder on the 2,4,6-TNT peak. Peak heights rather than peak areas should be used when tetryl is present in concentrations that are significant relative to the concentration of 2,4,6-TNT.\nHistory and synthesis.\nTetryl was used mainly during World Wars I and II and later conflicts. Tetryl is usually used on its own, though can sometimes be found in compositions such as tetrytol. Tetryl is no longer manufactured or used in the United States, but can still be found in legacy munitions such as the M14 anti-personnel landmine.\nDutch chemist Karel Hendrik Mertens originally synthesized the compound as a part of his doctoral dissertation published in 1877 by slowly mixing dimethylaniline with concentrated nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid, and it's still a viable lab technique. However, in the 1930s a more economical route was commercialized, where methylamine produced by the Smole\u0144ski method (developed after WWI) reacts with dinitrochlorobenzene to make dinitromethylaniline which is then easily nitrated without byproducts.\nHealth concerns.\nAlthough tetryl is among the most toxic explosive compounds, it is very short-lived, especially if in fact detonated. This combined with the fact that the health impacts of this compound are largely unstudied, not much is known about any health problems that this compound may cause.\nEpidemiological data shows that tetryl has most effect on the skin, acting as a strong irritant. Symptoms of skin sensitization such as dermatitis, itch, erythema, etc. may occur. Tetryl can also affect mucous membranes, the upper respiratory tract, and possibly the liver.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57076", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57076", "title": "HMX", "text": "&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nHMX, also called octogen, is a powerful and relatively insensitive nitroamine high explosive chemically related to RDX. The compound's name is the subject of much speculation, having been variously listed as High Melting Explosive, High-velocity Military Explosive, or High-Molecular-weight RDX.\nThe molecular structure of HMX consists of an eight-membered ring of alternating carbon and nitrogen atoms, with a nitro group attached to each nitrogen atom. Because of its high mass-specific enthalpy of formation, it is one of the most potent chemical explosives manufactured, although a number of newer ones, including HNIW, TKX-50, and ONC, are more powerful.\nSynthesis.\nHMX is more complicated to manufacture than most explosives, and this confines it to specialist applications. It and RDX are both produced by the Bachmann process\u2014nitration of hexamine using a mixture of ammonium nitrate and nitric acid in a mixture of acetic acid and acetic anhydride as solvent\u2014with the major product determined by the specific reaction conditions.\nApplications.\nAlso known as cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine, tetrahexamine tetranitramine, or octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine, HMX was first made in 1930. In 1949 it was discovered that HMX can be prepared by nitrolysis of RDX. Nitrolysis of RDX is performed by dissolving RDX in a 55% HNO3 solution, followed by placing the solution on a steambath for about six hours. HMX is used almost exclusively in military applications, including as the detonator in nuclear weapons, in the form of polymer-bonded explosive, and as a solid-rocket propellant.\nHMX is used in melt-castable explosives when mixed with TNT, which as a class are referred to as \"octols\". Additionally, polymer-bonded explosive compositions containing HMX are used in the manufacture of missile warheads and armor-piercing shaped charges.\nHMX is also used in the process of perforating the steel casing in oil and gas wells. The HMX is built into a shaped charge that is detonated within the wellbore to punch a hole through the steel casing and surrounding cement out into the hydrocarbon-bearing formations. The pathway that is created allows formation fluids to flow into the wellbore and onward to the surface.\nThe \"Hayabusa2\" space probe used HMX to excavate a hole in an asteroid in order to access material that had not been exposed to the solar wind.\nOngoing research aims to reduce its sensitivity and improve some manufacturing properties.\nHealth and environmental fate.\nAnalytical methods.\nHMX enters the environment through air, water, and soil because it is widely used in military and civil applications. At present, reverse-phase HPLC and more sensitive LC-MS methods have been developed to accurately quantify the concentration of HMX in a variety of matrices in environmental assessments.\nToxicity.\nAt present, the information needed to determine if HMX causes cancer is insufficient. Due to the lack of information, EPA has determined that HMX is not classifiable as to its human carcinogenicity.\nThe available data on the effects on human health of exposure to HMX are limited. HMX causes CNS effects similar to those of RDX, but at considerably higher doses. In one study, volunteers submitted to patch testing, which produced skin irritation. Another study of a cohort of 93 workers at an ammunition plant found no hematological, hepatic, autoimmune, or renal diseases. However, the study did not quantify the levels of exposure to HMX.\nHMX exposure has been investigated in several studies on animals. Overall, the toxicity appears to be quite low. HMX is poorly absorbed by ingestion. When applied to the dermis, it induces mild skin irritation but not delayed contact sensitization. Various acute and subchronic neurobehavioral effects have been reported in rabbits and rodents, including ataxia, sedation, hyperkinesia, and convulsions. The chronic effects of HMX that have been documented through animal studies include decreased hemoglobin, increased serum alkaline phosphatase, and decreased albumin. Pathological changes were also observed in the animals' livers and kidneys.\nGas exchange rate was used as an indicator of chemical stress in Northern bobwhite quail (\"Colinus virginianus\") eggs, and no evidence of alterations in metabolic rates associated with HMX exposure was observed. No data are available concerning the possible reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of HMX. HMX is considered less toxic than TNT or RDX. Remediating HMX-contaminated water supplies has proven to be successful.\nBiodegradation.\nBoth wild and transgenic plants can phytoremediate explosives from soil and water.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The leaves are most often used raw in green salads, although lettuce is also seen in other kinds of food, such as sandwiches, wraps and soups; it can also be grilled. Its stem and seeds are sometimes used; celtuce (asparagus lettuce) is one variety grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or cooked. In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption. Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world. In 2023, world production of lettuce (and chicory) was 28 million tonnes, led by China with 53% of the total.\nLettuce was originally farmed by the ancient Egyptians, who transformed it from a plant whose seeds were used to obtain oil into an important food crop raised for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans; the latter gave it the name , from which the English \"lettuce\" is derived. By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century, cultivars were described that can still be found in modern gardens.\nGenerally grown as a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, although it requires relatively low temperatures to prevent it from flowering quickly. It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. \"L. sativa\" crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the genus \"Lactuca\". Although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.\nContaminated lettuce is often a source of bacterial, viral, and parasitic outbreaks in humans, including \"E. coli\" and \"Salmonella\".\nTaxonomy and etymology.\n\"Lactuca sativa\" is a member of the \"Lactuca\" (lettuce) genus and the Asteraceae (sunflower or aster) family. The species was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his \"Species Plantarum\". Synonyms for \"L.\u00a0sativa\" include \"Lactuca scariola\" var. \"sativa\", \"L.\u00a0scariola\" var. \"integrata\" and \"L.\u00a0scariola\" var. \"integrifolia\". \"L.\u00a0scariola\" is itself a synonym for \"L.\u00a0serriola\", the common wild or prickly lettuce. \"L.\u00a0sativa\" also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce. Lettuce is closely related to several \"Lactuca\" species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to \"L.\u00a0serriola\", an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in much of the world.\nThe Romans referred to lettuce as ( meaning \"milk\" in Latin), an allusion to the white substance, latex, exuded by cut stems. The name \"Lactuca\" has become the genus name, while (meaning \"sown\" or \"cultivated\") was added to create the species name. The current word \"lettuce\", originally from Middle English, came from the Old French or , which derived from the Roman name. The name \"romaine\" came from the variety of lettuce grown in the Roman papal gardens, while , another term for romaine lettuce, came from the earliest European seeds of the type from the Greek island of Kos, a center of lettuce farming in the Byzantine period.\nDescription.\nLettuce's native range spreads from the Mediterranean to Siberia, although it has been transported to almost all areas of the world. Plants generally have a height and spread of . The leaves are colorful, mainly in the green and red color spectrums, with some variegated varieties. There are also a few varieties with yellow, gold or blue-teal leaves.\nLettuces have a wide range of shapes and textures, from the dense heads of the iceberg type to the notched, scalloped, frilly or ruffly leaves of leaf varieties. Lettuce plants have a root system that includes a main taproot and smaller secondary roots. Some varieties, especially those found in the United States and Western Europe, have long, narrow taproots and a small set of secondary roots. Longer taproots and more extensive secondary systems are found in varieties from Asia.\nDepending on the variety and time of year, lettuce generally lives 65\u2013130 days from planting to harvesting. Because lettuce that flowers (through the process known as \"bolting\") becomes bitter and unsaleable, plants grown for consumption are rarely allowed to grow to maturity. Lettuce flowers more quickly in hot temperatures, while freezing temperatures cause slower growth and sometimes damage to outer leaves.\nOnce plants move past the edible stage, they develop flower stalks up to high with small yellow blossoms. Like other members of the tribe Cichorieae, lettuce inflorescences (also known as flower heads or capitula) are composed of multiple florets, each with a modified calyx called a pappus (which becomes the feathery \"parachute\" of the fruit), a corolla of five petals fused into a ligule or strap, and the reproductive parts. These include fused anthers that form a tube which surrounds a style and bipartite stigma. As the anthers shed pollen, the style elongates to allow the stigmas, now coated with pollen, to emerge from the tube. The ovaries form compressed, obovate (teardrop-shaped) dry fruits that do not open at maturity, measuring 3 to 4\u00a0mm long. The fruits have 5\u20137 ribs on each side and are tipped by two rows of small white hairs. The pappus remains at the top of each fruit as a dispersal structure. Each fruit contains one seed, which can be white, yellow, gray or brown depending on the variety of lettuce.\nThe domestication of lettuce over the centuries has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors. Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and the United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns. However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture.\nHistory.\nDNA analysis of 445 types of lettuce indicates that lettuce was first domesticated from its wild ancestor near the Caucasus, where seed shattering was first selected out of the cultivar. At this time, the lettuce plant was only suitable for harvesting its seeds, which could be pressed to extract oil, likely used for cooking, among other purposes. From there, lettuce was likely transported to the Near East and then to ancient Egypt, where the first depictions of lettuce cultivation can be found as early as 2680 BC. Like the early lettuce from the Caucasus, this lettuce was grown to produce cooking oil from its seeds.\nLettuce was considered a sacred plant of the reproduction god Min, and was carried during his festivals and placed near his images. The plant was thought to help the god \"perform the sexual act untiringly\". Its use in religious ceremonies resulted in the creation of many images in tombs and wall paintings. The cultivated variety appears to have been about tall and resembled a large version of the modern romaine lettuce. These upright lettuces were developed by the Egyptians and passed to the Greeks, who in turn shared them with the Romans. Around 50 AD, Roman agriculturalist Columella described several lettuce varieties\u00a0\u2013 some of which may have been ancestors of today's lettuces.\nThe plant was eventually selectively bred into a plant grown for its edible leaves. The long leaves in Egyptian depictions suggest that it may have been grown for its leaves, which would make it the first lettuce cultivar grown for this purpose. However, genome wide analysis suggests the traits needed for cultivation as a leafy vegetable, like the loss of bitterness and thorns, evolved much later, from around 500 BC in Southern Europe. Lettuce cultivars radiated more rapidly from this point, with oilseed lettuce likely being brought by the ancient Greeks from Egypt to Italy, where it was modified into \"cos\" lettuce and cultivated for its leaves. From there, it was brought north to Central Europe, where it was modified into butterhead lettuce and other varieties.\nLettuce appears in many medieval writings, especially as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned it in her writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses. In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces\u00a0\u2013 head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine (or cos) lettuce. Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.\nDue to its short lifespan after harvest, lettuce was originally sold relatively close to where it was grown. The early 20th century saw the development of new packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and transportability of lettuce and resulted in a significant increase in availability. During the 1950s, lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and packing of lettuce, replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.\nLettuce is easy to grow, and as such has been a significant source of sales for many seed companies. Tracing the history of many varieties is complicated by the practice of many companies, particularly in the US, of changing a variety's name from year to year. This practice is conducted for several reasons, the most prominent being to boost sales by promoting a \"new\" variety, or to prevent customers from knowing that the variety had been developed by a competing seed company. Documentation from the late 19th century shows between 65 and 140 distinct varieties of lettuce, depending on the amount of variation allowed between types\u00a0\u2013 a distinct difference from the 1,100 named lettuce varieties on the market at the time. Names also often changed significantly from country to country. Although most lettuce grown today is used as a vegetable, a minor amount is used in the production of tobacco-free cigarettes; however, domestic lettuce's wild relatives produce a leaf that visually more closely resembles tobacco.\nCultivation.\nA hardy annual, some varieties of lettuce can be overwintered even in relatively cold climates under a layer of straw, and older, heirloom varieties are often grown in cold frames. Lettuces meant for the cutting of individual leaves are generally planted straight into the garden in thick rows. Heading varieties of lettuces are commonly started in flats, then transplanted to individual spots, usually apart, in the garden after developing several leaves. Lettuce spaced farther apart receives more sunlight, which improves color and nutrient quantities in the leaves. Pale to white lettuce, such as the centers in some iceberg lettuce, contain few nutrients.\nLettuce grows best in full sun in loose, nitrogen-rich soils with a pH of between 6.0 and 6.8. Heat generally prompts lettuce to bolt, with most varieties growing poorly above ; cool temperatures prompt better performance, with being preferred and as low as being tolerated. Plants in hot areas that are provided partial shade during the hottest part of the day will bolt more slowly. Temperatures above will generally result in poor or non-existent germination of lettuce seeds. After harvest, lettuce lasts the longest when kept at and 96 percent humidity. The high water content of lettuce (94.9 percent) creates problems when attempting to preserve the plant\u00a0\u2013 it cannot be successfully frozen, canned or dried and must be eaten fresh. In spite of its high water content, traditionally grown lettuce has a low water footprint, with of water required for each kilogram of lettuce produced. Hydroponic growing methods can reduce this water consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude.\nLettuce varieties will cross with each other, making spacing of between varieties necessary to prevent contamination when saving seeds. Lettuce will also cross with \"Lactuca serriola\" (wild lettuce), with the resulting seeds often producing a plant with tough, bitter leaves. Celtuce, a lettuce variety grown primarily in Asia for its stems, crosses easily with lettuces grown for their leaves. This propensity for crossing, however, has led to breeding programs using closely related species in \"Lactuca\", such as \"L. serriola\", \"L. saligna\", and \"L. virosa\", to broaden the available gene pool. Starting in the 1990s, such programs began to include more distantly related species such as \"L. tatarica\".\nSeeds keep best when stored in cool conditions, and, unless stored cryogenically, remain viable the longest when stored at ; they are relatively short lived in storage. At room temperature, lettuce seeds remain viable for only a few months. However, when newly harvested lettuce seed is stored cryogenically, this life increases to a half-life of 500 years for vaporized nitrogen and 3,400 years for liquid nitrogen; this advantage is lost if seeds are not frozen promptly after harvesting.\nCultivars (varieties).\nThere are several types and cultivars of lettuce. Categorization may sometimes refer to \"leaf\" versus \"head\", but there are seven main cultivar groups of lettuce, each including many varieties:\nThe four main types in the Western world have been looseleaf, romaine, crisphead, and butterhead, with the others being intermediary or more exotic. The butterhead and crisphead types are sometimes known together as \"cabbage\" lettuce, because their heads are shorter, flatter, and more cabbage-like than romaine lettuces.\nCultivation problems.\nSoil nutrient deficiencies can cause a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants to a lack of head growth. Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause stunted growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves. For example, the larvae of the ghost moth is a common pest of lettuce plants. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants. Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural phenolics such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests. Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.\nLettuce also suffers from several viral diseases, including big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew, which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot and collapse. Bacterial diseases include \"Botrytis cinerea\", for which UV-C treatments may be used: V\u00e0squez et al. 2017 find that phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity, phenolic production, and \"B. cinerea\" resistance are increased by UV-C. Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases. Weeds can also be an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult. Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, this has led to the development of herbicide-resistant weeds in lettuce cultivation.\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2023, world production of lettuce (report combined with chicory) was 28 million tonnes, with China alone accounting for 53% of the total (table).\nLettuce is the only member of the genus \"Lactuca\" to be grown commercially.\nMarkets.\nWestern Europe and North America were the original major markets for large-scale lettuce production. By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets. Different locations tended to prefer different types of lettuce, with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt. By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially iceberg, lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe. In the US, no one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity. After the 1940s, with the development of iceberg lettuce, 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce. By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production. Stem lettuce was first developed in China, where it remains primarily cultivated.\nIn the early 21st century, bagged salad products increased in the lettuce market, especially in the US where innovative packaging and shipping methods prolonged freshness.\nIn the United States in 2022, lettuce was the main vegetable ingredient in salads, and was the most consumed among leaf vegetables; its market was about 20% of all vegetables, with Romaine and iceberg having about equal sales. Some 85% of the lettuce consumed in the United States in 2022 was produced domestically.\nUses.\nCulinary.\nAs described around 50 AD, lettuce leaves were often cooked and served by the Romans with an oil-and-vinegar dressing; however, smaller leaves were sometimes eaten raw. During the 81\u201396 AD reign of Domitian, the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began. Post-Roman Europe continued the tradition of poaching lettuce, mainly with large romaine types, as well as the method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves.\nToday, the majority of lettuce is grown for its leaves, although one type is grown for its stem and one for its seeds, which are made into an oil. Most lettuce is used in salads, either alone or with other greens, vegetables, meats and cheeses. Romaine lettuce is often used for Caesar salads. Lettuce leaves can also be found in soups, sandwiches and wraps, while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked.\nThe consumption of lettuce in China developed differently from in Western countries, due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves; Chinese \"salads\" are composed of cooked vegetables and are served hot or cold. Lettuce is also used in a larger variety of dishes than in Western countries, contributing to a range of dishes including bean curd and meat dishes, soups and stir-frys plain or with other vegetables. Stem lettuce, widely consumed in China, is eaten either raw or cooked, the latter primarily in soups and stir-frys. Lettuce is also used as a primary ingredient in the preparation of lettuce soup.\nNutrition.\nRaw iceberg lettuce is 96% water, 3% carbohydrates, and contains negligible protein and fat (table). In a reference amount of , iceberg lettuce supplies 14 calories and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin K (20% DV), with no other micronutrients in significant content (table).\nIn lettuce varieties with dark green leaves, such as romaine (also called \"cos\"), vitamin A contents are appreciable due to the presence of the provitamin A compound, beta-carotene. Dark green varieties of lettuce also contain moderate amounts of calcium and iron. The edible spine and ribs of the lettuce plant supply dietary fiber, while micronutrients are contained in the leaf portion.\nFood-borne illness.\nFood-borne pathogens that can survive on lettuce include \"Listeria monocytogenes\", the causative agent of listeriosis, which multiplies in storage. However, despite high levels of bacteria being found on ready-to-eat lettuce products, a 2008 study found no incidents of food-borne illness related to listeriosis, possibly due to the product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the \"Listeria\" bacteria or inhibition of bacteria to cause listeriosis.\nOther bacteria found on lettuce include \"Aeromonas\" species, which have not been linked to any outbreaks; \"Campylobacter\" species, which cause campylobacteriosis; and \"Yersinia intermedia\" and \"Yersinia kristensenii\" (species of \"Yersinia\"), which have been found mainly in lettuce. \"Salmonella\" bacteria, including the uncommon \"Salmonella braenderup\" type, have also caused outbreaks traced to contaminated lettuce. Viruses, including hepatitis A, calicivirus and a Norwalk-like strain, have been found in lettuce. The vegetable has also been linked to outbreaks of parasitic infestations, including \"Giardia lamblia\".\nLettuce has been linked to numerous outbreaks of the bacteria and \"Shigella\"; the plants were most likely contaminated through contact with animal or human feces. A 2007 study determined that the vacuum cooling method, especially prevalent in the California lettuce industry, increased the uptake and survival rates of \"E. coli\" O157:H7. Scientific experiments using treated municipal wastewater as irrigation for romaine lettuce have shown that the contamination levels of foliage, leachate, and soil with \"E. coli\" and bacteriophage AP205 (used by researchers as a surrogate for enteric viruses), respectively, were directly correlated with the presence of these organisms in the irrigation water.\nDue to the increase in food demand, the use of treated wastewater effluent for irrigation and animal or human excreta (i.e., manure or biosolids) as soil amendments is increasing. As such, so are the outbreaks of food-borne illnesses. Due to the overuse of antibiotics in farming, the number of pathogens resistant to antibiotics is increasing, one of these being \"AR E.coli\", which has been found on lettuce irrigated with wastewater.\nPathogens found on lettuce are not specific to lettuce (though some \"E. coli\" strains have affinity for Romaine). But, unlike other vegetables which tend to be cooked, lettuce is eaten raw, thus food-borne outbreaks associated with it are more frequent and affect a larger number of people.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57095", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57095", "title": "Tartarus", "text": "Place and deity in Greek mythology\nIn Greek mythology, Tartarus (; ) is the deep abyss that is used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans. Tartarus is the place where, according to Plato's \"Gorgias\" (c.\u2009400 BC), souls are judged after death and where the wicked received divine punishment. Tartarus appears in early Greek cosmology, such as in Hesiod's \"Theogony\", where the personified Tartarus is described as one of the earliest beings to exist, alongside Chaos and Gaia (Earth).\nGreek mythology.\nIn Greek mythology, Tartarus is both a deity and a place in the underworld.\nAs a deity.\nIn the Greek poet Hesiod's \"Theogony\" (c.\u00a0late 8th century BC), Tartarus was the third of the primordial deities, following after Chaos and Gaia (Earth), and preceding Eros, and was the father, by Gaia, of the monster Typhon. According to Hyginus, Tartarus was the offspring of Aether and Gaia.\nAs a location.\nHesiod asserts that a bronze anvil falling from heaven would fall nine days before it reached the earth. The anvil would take nine more days to fall from earth to Tartarus. In the \"Iliad\" (c.\u00a08th century BC), Zeus asserts that Tartarus is \"as far beneath Hades as heaven is above earth.\" Similarly the mythographer Apollodorus, describes Tartarus as \"a gloomy place in Hades as far distant from earth as earth is distant from the sky.\"\nWhile according to Greek mythology the realm of Hades is the place of the dead, Tartarus also has a number of inhabitants. When Cronus came to power as the King of the Titans, he imprisoned the three ancient one-eyed Cyclopes and only the hundred-armed Hecatonchires in Tartarus and set the monster Campe as its guard. Campe was part scorpion and had a ring of animal heads around her waist, snapping at anyone who dared to get near. She also carried a whip to torture the Cyclopes and the hundred-armed ones. Zeus killed Campe and released these imprisoned giants to aid in his conflict with the Titans. The gods of Olympus eventually triumphed. Cronus and many of the other Titans were banished to Tartarus, though Prometheus, Epimetheus, and female Titans such as Metis were spared. Other gods could be sentenced to Tartarus as well. In the Homeric hymn to Hermes, Apollo threatens to throw Hermes into Tartarus. Apollo himself was almost condemned to Tartarus by Zeus for the act of killing the Cyclops. The Hecatonchires became guards of Tartarus's prisoners. Later, when Zeus overcame the monster Typhon, he threw him into \"wide Tartarus\".\nResidents.\nOriginally, \"Tartarus\" was used only to confine dangers to the gods of Olympus and their predecessors. In later mythologies, Tartarus became a space dedicated to the imprisonment and torment of mortals who had sinned against the gods, and each punishment was unique to the condemned. For example:\nAccording to Plato (c.\u2009427 BC), Rhadamanthus, Aeacus and Minos were the judges of the dead and chose who went to Tartarus. Rhadamanthus judged Asian souls, Aeacus judged European souls and Minos was the deciding vote and judge of the Greek. Souls regarded as unjust or perjured would go to Tartarus. Those who committed crimes seen as curable would be purified there, while those who committed crimes seen as uncurable would be eternally damned, and demonstrate a warning example for the living. In Gorgias, Plato writes about Socrates telling Callicles, who believes might makes right, that doing injustice to others is worse than suffering injustice, and most uncurable inhabitants of Tartarus were tyrants whose might gave them the opportunity to commit huge crimes. Archelaus I of Macedon is mentioned as a possible example of this, while Thersites is said to be curable, because of his lack of might. According to Plato's Phaedo, the uncurable consisted of temple robbers and murderers, while sons who killed one of their parents during a status of rage but regretted this their whole life, and involuntary manslaughterers, would be taken out of Tartarus after one year, so they could ask their victims for forgiveness. If they should be forgiven, they were liberated, but if not, would go back and stay there until they were finally pardoned. In the \"Republic\", Plato mentions the Myth of Er, who is said to have been a fallen soldier who resurrected from the dead, and saw their realm. According to this, the length of a punishment an adult receives for each crime in Tartarus, who is responsible for a lot of deaths, betrayed states or armies and sold them into slavery or had been involved in similar misdeeds, corresponds to ten times out of a hundred earthly years (while good deeds would be rewarded in equal measure).\nThere were a number of entrances to Tartarus in Greek mythology. One was in Aornum.\nRoman mythology.\nIn Roman mythology, sinners (as defined by the Roman societal and cultural norms of their time) are sent to Tartarus for punishment after death. Virgil describes Tartarus in great detail in the . He described it as expansive. It is surrounded by three perimeter walls, beyond which flows a flaming river named the Phlegethon. Drinking from the Phlegethon will not kill a mortal and it will heal while causing great pain. To further prevent escape, a hydra with fifty black, gaping jaws sits atop a gate that screeches when opened. They are flanked by adamantine columns, a substance that, like diamond, was believed to be so hard that nothing can cut through it.\nInside the walls of Tartarus sits a wide-walled castle with a tall, iron turret. Tisiphone, one of the Erinyes, who represents vengeance, stands sleepless guard at the top of the turret lashing her whip. Roman mythology describes a pit inside extending down into the earth twice as far as the distance from the lands of the living to Olympus. The twin sons of the Titan Aloeus were said to be imprisoned at the bottom of this pit.\nBiblical pseudepigrapha.\nTartarus occurs in the Septuagint translation of Job (40:20 and 41:24) into Koine Greek, and in Hellenistic Jewish literature from the Greek text of the Book of Enoch, dated to 400\u2013200 BC. This states that God placed the archangel Uriel \"in charge of the world and of Tartarus\" (20:2). Tartarus is generally understood to be the place where 200 fallen Watchers (angels) are imprisoned.\nReference to the watchers of the book of Enoch is also observed in Jude 1:6-7 where scripture describes Angels being bound by chains under everlasting darkness, and 2 Peter 2:4 which further describes fallen angels committed to chains in Tartarus.\nIn \"Hypostasis of the Archons\" (also translated 'Reality of the Rulers'), an apocryphal gnostic treatise dated before 350 AD, Tartarus makes a brief appearance when Z\u014d\u0113 (life), the daughter of Sophia (wisdom) casts Ialdaba\u014dth (demiurge) down to the bottom of the abyss of Tartarus.\nIn The Book of Thomas, Tartaros is claimed by Jesus to be the place where those who hear the word of Judas Thomas and \"turn away or sneer\" are to be sent. These damned will be handed over to the angel or power Tartarouchos.\nNew Testament.\nIn the New Testament, the noun \"Tartarus\" does not occur but \"tartaro\u014d\" (\"\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03c9\", \"throw to Tartarus\"), a shortened form of the classical Greek verb \"kata-tartaro\u014d\" (\"throw down to Tartarus\"), does appear in 2 Peter 2:4. Liddell\u2013Scott provides other sources for the shortened form of this verb, including Acusilaus (5th century BC), Joannes Laurentius Lydus (4th century AD) and the Scholiast on Aeschylus's \"Eumenides\", who cites Pindar relating how the earth tried to \"tartaro\" \"cast down\" Apollo after he overcame the Python. In classical texts, the longer form \"kata-tartaroo\" is often related to the throwing of the Titans down to Tartarus.\nThe English Standard Version is one of several English versions that gives the Greek reading Tartarus as a footnote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell(a) and committed them to chains(b) of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment;\u2014\u200a\nAdam Clarke reasoned that Peter's use of language relating to the Titans was an indication that the ancient Greeks had heard of a Biblical punishment of fallen angels. Some Evangelical Christian commentaries distinguish Tartarus as a place for wicked angels and Gehenna as a place for wicked humans on the basis of this verse. Other Evangelical commentaries, in reconciling that some fallen angels are chained in Tartarus, yet some not, attempt to distinguish between one type of fallen angel and another.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the UK, a dessert wine is considered to be any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white fortified wines (fino and amontillado sherry) drunk before the meal and the red fortified wines (port and madeira) drunk after it. Thus, most fortified wines are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less-strong fortified white wines, such as Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry and Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, are regarded as honorary dessert wines. In the United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% alcohol by volume, which includes all fortified wines\u2014and is taxed more highly as a result. This dates back to when the US wine industry only made dessert wines by fortification, but such a classification is outdated now that modern yeast and viticulture can produce dry wines over 15% without fortification (and German dessert wines can contain half that amount of alcohol).\nMethods of production.\nMakers of dessert wines want to produce a wine containing high levels of both sugar and alcohol. Since all winemaking creates alcohol from fermentation of sugars they are typically traded off. However, there are many ways to increase relative sugar levels in the final wine:\nNatural sweetness.\nIn the absence of other techniques, makers of dessert wine have to produce their sugar in the vineyard. Some grape varieties, such as Muscat, Ortega and Huxelrebe, naturally produce much more sugar than others. Environmental conditions have a big effect on ultimate sugar levels; the vigneron can help by leaving the grapes on the vine until they are fully ripe, and by green harvesting and pruning to expose the young grapes to the sun. Green harvesting reduces the number of bunches on a vine early in the summer, so that the sugar production of the leaves is divided between fewer bunches. While the vigneron cannot control the sun, a sunny year regulates sugar levels. The semi-sweet Auslese wines in the German wine classification are probably the best example of this approach; most modern winemakers perceive that their customers want either fully dry or 'properly' sweet dessert wines, so 'leave it to nature' is currently out of fashion. But most of the Muscats of ancient times were probably made this way, including the famous Constantia of South Africa.\nChaptalization.\nHoney was added to wine in Roman times, for sweetness and to increase the final strength of the wine. Today sugar is usually added in order to boost the alcohol levels of flabby, unripe wines rather than for sweetness, although a degree of chaptalization is permitted in the wines of many countries. German wines must declare whether they are 'natural' or not; in any case, chaptalization is banned from the top tiers of German wines.\nS\u00fcssreserve.\nThe 'reserve of sweetness' is a German technique in which unfermented must (grape juice) is added to the wine after fermentation. This increases the sweetness of the final wine and dilutes the alcohol somewhat\u2014in Germany the final wine can contain no more than 15% S\u00fcssreserve by volume. S\u00fcssreserve allows winemakers to fully ferment the wine without having to worry about stopping fermentation before all the sugar has gone. Since sulphites are used to stop fermentation, this technique reduces the usage of sulphites. S\u00fcssreserve is used by other makers of German-style wines, particularly in New Zealand.\nFortification.\nThe main fortified wines drunk with dessert are sweet Montilla-Moriles &amp; sherry, particularly Pedro Xim\u00e9nez, and vins doux naturels. The Pedro Ximenez dessert wine is unique because it is a raisin wine that is then fortified and aged in a solera system like other sweet wine from Andalucia. Other sweet sherries (is a blend wine) such as Bristol Cream may also be drunk as dessert wine.\nThe production of vins doux naturels was perfected by Arnaud de Villeneuve at the University of Montpellier in the 13th century. They are now quite common in the Languedoc-Roussillon of southwest France. As the names suggest, Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, Muscat de Rivesaltes, Muscat de Frontignan, Muscat de Lunel, Muscat de Mireval and Muscat de St-Jean Minervois are all made from the white Muscat grape, whilst Banyuls and Maury are made from red Grenache. Regardless of the grape, fermentation is stopped with up to 10% of 95% grape spirit. The Muscats are made in a somewhat oxidised style, the Grenaches less so.\nRaisin wine.\nIn ancient Carthage, a sweet wine called \"passum\" was made from air-dried grapes and across the Malta Channel from the site of Carthage similar wines are still made, called Moscato Passito di Pantelleria. Such wines were described by the Romans. Northern Italy is home to a number of 'passito' wines, where the grapes are dried on straw, on racks, or hung from the rafters. These wines include Vin Santo (into which almond biscuits, 'cantucci', are traditionally dunked), Sciachetr\u00e0, Recioto di Soave (drunk with the local version of panettone) and the sweet red Recioto della Valpolicella (which stands up to chocolate better than most wine). Across the Alps, the French make 'straw wine' (\"vin de paille\") in the Jura, Rhone and Alsace; the Spanish start off making a raisin wine with Pedro Xim\u00e9nez before fortifying it; the Cypriots have their ancient Commandaria; and there have been recent experiments with the style in South Africa and the US.\nIce wine.\nMost wine laws require temperatures below at most \u22127\u00a0\u00b0C (19\u00a0\u00b0F) before the grapes for ice wine can be picked. At such temperatures, some water in the grapes freezes but the sugars and other solids remain dissolved in the remaining juice. If the grapes are pressed while frozen, a very concentrated must can result, which needs special yeast and a long time to ferment. The resulting wines are very sweet, but balanced by their acidity. The minuscule yields mean they tend to be very expensive. The most famous are German \"Eiswein\" and Canadian Icewine, but ice wines are also made in the United States, Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Italy, Australia, France and New Zealand in smaller quantities.\nNoble rot wine.\nThe primary distinction between botrytized wines and other non-fortified sweet wines, such as late-harvest wines, ice wines (eiswein), or straw wines, lies in the extensive range and richness of aroma compounds generated by Botrytis cinerea fungal infection of the grapes. Significant differences are also evident in other components, like glycerol and acid composition, due to microbial activity. Descriptors frequently used for these wines highlight flavours of peach, apricot, pear, quince, raisin, and honey, along with unique \"botrytis\" or roti characteristics. Additionally, a notable feature of botrytized wines is their high acid content, which prevents them from tasting cloying, even with sugar levels often exceeding 200 g/l\nSome of the most famous dessert wines, such as Tokaji Asz\u00fa of Tokaj-Hegyalja in Hungary, Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem of Sauternes, and Seewinkel of Austria, are made using grapes mouldy with \"Botrytis cinerea\", which sucks water out of the grape whilst imparting flavours of honey and apricot to the future wine.\nThe fungus requires specific conditions to produce \"noble rot\"; if it is too damp, the same fungus causes destructive \"grey rot\". Vignerons endeavour to maximise the amount of noble rot without losing the whole crop to grey rot. Typically, noble rot forms best in conditions with regular morning mist, normally from a nearby lake or the sea. The wait for noble rot to form means these wines are usually harvested late.\nThe first noble rot wines were likely created by accident\u2014both the Hungarians and the Germans have similar stories of how the harvest was delayed for some reason, but the mouldy grapes were vinified anyway and then found to be delicious. Given that propensity to noble rot was a factor in Hungarian vineyard demarcations some 50 years before a messenger was supposedly mugged on his way to Schloss Johannisberg in Germany and asz\u00fa inventory predates it by about 200 years, Hungary's Tokaj is where it was first produced. Germany may have later discovered the same process independently.\nNoble rot is responsible for many other dessert wines, including Beerenauslese and Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA) of the German wine classification, French Monbazillac, Austrian Beerenauslese, Ausbruch and other TBA-type wines from all over the world.\nServing.\nA general rule is that the wine should be sweeter than the food it is served with\u2014a perfectly ripe peach has been described as the ideal partner for many dessert wines, whereas it makes sense not to drink wine at all with many chocolate- and toffee-based dishes. Red dessert wines like Recioto della Valpolicella and fortified wines like the vin doux naturel Muscats are the best matches for such difficult-to-pair desserts.\nAlternatively, the wine itself can be a dessert, but bakery sweets can make a good match, particularly with a little bitterness like biscuits that are dunked in Vin Santo. A development of this matching of contrasts is a rich savoury dish like the foie gras that is a traditional partner to Sauternes.\nWhite dessert wines are generally served somewhat chilled, but can be easily served too cold. Red dessert wines are served at room temperature or slightly chilled.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They had three children who survived infancy: Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who predeceased his parents; Princess Elizabeth, who became Queen of Bohemia; and James's future successor, Charles I. Anne demonstrated an independent streak and a willingness to use factional Scottish politics in her conflicts with James over the custody of Prince Henry and his treatment of her friend Beatrix Ruthven. Anne appears to have loved James at first, but the couple gradually drifted and eventually lived apart, though mutual respect and a degree of affection survived.\nIn England, Anne shifted her energies from factional politics to patronage of the arts and constructed her own magnificent court, hosting one of the richest cultural salons in Europe. After 1612, she had sustained bouts of ill health and gradually withdrew from the centre of court life. Though she was reported to have been a Protestant at the time of her death, she may have converted to Catholicism at some point.\nSome historians have dismissed Anne as frivolous and self-indulgent. However, 18th-century writers including Thomas Birch and William Guthrie considered her a woman of \"boundless intrigue\". Recent reappraisals acknowledge Anne's assertive independence and, in particular, her dynamic significance as a patron of the arts during the Jacobean age.\nEarly life.\nAnne was born on 12 December 1574 at the castle of Skanderborg on the Jutland Peninsula in the Kingdom of Denmark to Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow and King Frederick II of Denmark. In need of a male heir the King had been hoping for a son, and Sophie gave birth to a son, Christian, three years later.\nWith her older sister, Elizabeth, Anne was sent to be raised at G\u00fcstrow by her maternal grandparents, the Duke and Duchess of Mecklenburg. Christian was also sent to be brought up at G\u00fcstrow but two years later, in 1579, his father the King wrote to his parents-in-law, to request the return of his sons, Christian and Ulrich, (probably, at the urging of the Rigsr\u00e5d, the Danish Privy Council), and Anne and Elizabeth returned with him.\nAnne enjoyed a close, happy family upbringing in Denmark, thanks largely to Queen Sophie, who nursed the children through their illnesses herself. Suitors from all over Europe sought the hands of Anne and Elizabeth in marriage, including James VI of Scotland, who favoured Denmark as a kingdom reformed in religion and a profitable trading partner.\nJames's other serious possibility, though eight years his senior, was Catherine, sister of the Huguenot King Henry III of Navarre (future Henry IV of France), who was favoured by Elizabeth I of England. One reason James set this option aside was Henry's hard requirement for military assistance. Scottish ambassadors in Denmark first concentrated their suit on the oldest daughter, but Frederick betrothed Elizabeth to Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick, promising the Scots instead that \"for the second [daughter] Anna, if the King did like her, he should have her.\" \nBetrothal and proxy marriage.\nThe constitutional position of Sophie, Anne's mother, became difficult after Frederick's death in 1588, when she found herself in a power struggle with the Rigsraad for control of her son King Christian IV. As a matchmaker, however, Sophie proved more diligent than Frederick and, overcoming sticking points on the amount of the dowry and the status of Orkney, she sealed the agreement by July 1589. Anne herself seems to have been thrilled with the match. On 28 July 1589, the English spy Thomas Fowler reported that Anne was \"so far in love with the King's Majesty as it were death to her to have it broken off and hath made good proof divers ways of her affection which his Majestie is apt enough to requite.\" Fowler's insinuation, that James preferred men to women, would have been hidden from the fourteen-year-old Anne, who devotedly embroidered shirts for her fianc\u00e9 while 300 tailors worked on her wedding dress.\nWhatever the truth of the rumours, James required a royal match to preserve the Stuart line. \"God is my witness\", he explained, \"I could have abstained longer than the weal of my country could have permitted, [had not] my long delay bred in the breasts of many a great jealousy of my inability, as if I were a barren stock.\" He wrote to Sophie from Aberdeen that Anne's portrait had \"fascinated our eyes and heart\" and he had \"no higher desire\" than to behold her in person. On 20 August 1589, Anne was married by proxy to James at Kronborg Castle, the ceremony ending with a torchlit procession and James's representative, George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, sitting next to Anne on the bridal bed.\nMarriage.\nAnne set sail for Scotland within 10 days, but her fleet under the command of Admiral Peder Munk was beset by misadventures. At Elsinore a naval gun backfired, killing two gunners. The next day, a gun fired in tribute to two visiting Scottish noblemen exploded, killing one gunner and injuring 9 of the crew. Storms at sea then put the fleet in severe difficulties and one report had Anne's ship missing for three days. Two of the ships in the flotilla collided, killing two more sailors. Anne's ship, the Gideon, sprang a dangerous leak and put into Gammel Sellohe in Norway for repairs, but it leaked again after setting sail. The fleet then put in at Flekker\u00f8y, by which time it was 1 October and the crews were unwilling to try again so late in the year. Anne was forced back to the coast of Norway, from where she travelled by land to Oslo for refuge, accompanied by the Earl Marischal and others of the Scottish and Danish embassies.\nOn 12 September Lord Dingwall had landed at Leith, reporting that \"he had come in company with the Queen's fleet three hundred miles, and was separated from them by a great storm: it was feared that the Queen was in danger upon the seas.\" Alarmed, James called for national fasting and public prayers, and kept watch on the Firth of Forth for Anne's arrival from Seton Palace, the home of his friend Lord Seton. He wrote several songs, one comparing the situation to the plight of Hero and Leander, and sent a search party out for Anne, carrying a letter he had written to her in French: \"Only to one who knows me as well as his own reflection in a glass could I express, my dearest love, the fears which I have experienced because of the contrary winds and violent storms since you embarked\". Anne's letters arrived in October explaining that she had abandoned the crossing. She wrote, in French;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;we have already put out to sea four or five times but have always been driven back to the harbours from which we sailed, thanks to contrary winds and other problems that arose at sea, which is the cause why, now Winter is hastening down on us, and fearing greater danger, all this company is forced to our regret, and to the regret and high displeasure of your men, to make no further attempt at present, but to defer the voyage until the Spring.\nIn what Willson calls \"the one romantic episode of his life\", James sailed from Leith with a three-hundred-strong retinue to fetch his wife personally. He arrived in Oslo on 19 November after travelling by land from Flekkefjord via T\u00f8nsberg. According to a Scottish account, he presented himself to Anne, \"with boots and all\", and, disarming her protests, gave her a kiss, in the Scottish fashion.\nAnne and James were formally married in hall of the Old Bishop's Palace in Oslo, then the house of Christen Mule, on 23 November 1589, \"with all the splendour possible at that time and place.\" So that both bride and groom could understand, Leith minister David Lindsay conducted the ceremony in French, describing Anne as \"a Princess both godly and beautiful\u00a0... she giveth great contentment to his Majesty.\" A month of celebrations followed; and on 22 December, cutting his entourage to 50, James visited his new relations at Kronborg Castle in Elsinore, where the newlyweds were greeted by Queen Sophie, 12 year-old King Christian IV, and Christian's four regents. Anne and James may have repeated their marriage ceremony at Kronborg, this time by Lutheran rites, on 21 January 1590. The couple moved on to Copenhagen on 7 March and attended the wedding of Anne's older sister Elizabeth to Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick on 19 April, sailing two days later for Scotland in a patched up \"Gideon\". They arrived in the Water of Leith on 1 May. After a welcoming speech in French by James Elphinstone, Anne stayed in the King's Wark and James went alone to hear a sermon by Patrick Galloway in the Parish Church. Five days later, Anne made her state entry into Edinburgh in a solid silver coach brought over from Denmark, James riding alongside on horseback.\nCoronation.\nAnne was crowned on 17 May 1590 in the Abbey Church at Holyrood, the first Protestant coronation in Scotland. During the seven-hour ceremony, her gown was opened by the Countess of Mar for presiding minister Robert Bruce to pour \"a bonny quantity of oil\" on \"parts of her breast and arm\", so anointing her as queen. (Kirk ministers had objected vehemently to this element of the ceremony as a pagan and Jewish ritual, but James insisted that it dated from the Old Testament.) The king handed the crown to Chancellor Maitland, who placed it on Anne's head. She then affirmed an oath to defend the true religion and worship of God and to \"withstand and despise all papistical superstitions, and whatsoever ceremonies and rites contrary to the word of God\".\nHousehold in Scotland.\nAnne brought servants and courtiers from Denmark, including the ladies-in-waiting and chamberers Katrine Skinkel, Anna Kaas, and Margaret Vinstarr, the preacher Johannes Sering, a page William Belo, and artisans such as goldsmith Jacob Kroger, the carpenter Frederick, her cooks Hans Poppilman and Marion, and her tailors. Her Danish secretary Calixtus Schein had two Scottish colleagues, William Fowler and John Geddie. The head of her first household was Wilhelm von der Wense. Servants from her home country provided familiarity and bridged a cultural divide.\nAt first, observers like William Dundas thought the queen led a solitary life, with few Scottish companions. Later in 1590 more Scottish noblewomen were appointed to serve her, including Marie Stewart, a daughter of Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, Margaret Wood, and members of the Ochiltree Stewart family. James invited Scottish lairds including Robert Mure of Caldwell to send gifts of hackney horses for the queen's ladies to ride. Anne bought her ladies and maidens of honour matching clothes and riding outfits, made by her Danish tailor P\u00e5l Rei and furrier Henrie Koss, and the Scottish tailors Peter Sanderson and Peter Rannald supervised by her master of Wardrobe, S\u00f8ren Johnson. She had an African servant, noted in the accounts only as the \"Moir\", who was probably a \"page of the equerry\", attending her horse. He was dressed in orange velvet and Spanish taffeta. When he died at Falkland Palace in July 1591, James paid for his funeral. The German physician Martin Sch\u00f6ner attended Anne when she was ill or in childbed.\nTwo Danish favourites, Katrine Skinkel and Sofie Kass wore velvet hats with feathers to match the queen's, made by an older gentlewoman in the household, Elizabeth Gibb, the wife of the king's tutor Peter Young. Anne gave her ladies wedding gowns and trousseaux when they married, and even arranged a loan for the dowry of Jean, Lady Kennedy. When, in December 1592 the widower John Erskine, Earl of Mar married Marie Stewart, James VI and Anne of Denmark attended the celebrations at Alloa and there was a masque in costume in which Anne of Denmark performed. Materials for Anne's masque costumes included lightweight silks and ribbons and \"plumages\" of feathers. Her court musicians in Scotland included John Norlie, an English lutenist.\nIn 1593, Anne told the English ambassador Robert Bowes that she would like to meet Queen Elizabeth, and wanted to have a young English gentleman or maiden of \"good parentage\" join her household. Bowes passed this request to Cecil to consider. She made another overture of friendship to Elizabeth I in May 1595, asking for her portrait. There was no response and Bowes had to reiterate her request. Finally, in February 1596 Elizabeth condescended to grant Anne's \"earnest desire\" and send her a picture.\nRelationship with James.\nBy all accounts, James was at first entranced by his bride, but his infatuation evaporated quickly and the couple often found themselves at loggerheads, though in the early years of their marriage James seems always to have treated Anne with patience and affection. James Melville of Halhill, a gentleman of her bedchamber, wrote that in Scotland Anne would intercede with James on behalf of honest courtiers, if she heard that he was stirred up against them by \"wrong information\" or slander.\nIn their first years of marriage, James VI and Anne of Denmark personally dressed in costume and took part in masques at the weddings of courtiers. These performances typically involved music, dance, and disguise. Between 1593 and 1595, James was romantically linked with Anne Murray, later Lady Glamis. He addressed her in verse as \"my mistress and my love\". Anne of Denmark herself was also occasionally the subject of scandalous rumours. In the \"Basilikon Doron\", written 1597\u20131598, James described marriage as \"the greatest earthly felicitie or miserie, that can come to a man\".\nFrom the first moment of the marriage, Anne was under pressure to provide James and Scotland with an heir. Even before Anne arrived in Scotland, rumours circulated that she was pregnant. but the passing of 1591 and 1592 with no sign of a pregnancy provoked renewed Presbyterian libels on the theme of James's fondness for male company and whispers against Anne \"for that she proves not with child\". When it was thought that she was pregnant, James tried to prevent her going horse riding but she refused. There was great public relief when on 19 February 1594 Anne gave birth to her first child, Henry Frederick. He was named after his two grandfathers, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and King Frederick II of Denmark.\nCustody of Prince Henry.\nAnne soon learned that she would have no say in her son's care. James appointed as head of the nursery his former nurse Helen Little, who installed Henry in James's own oak cradle. Most distressingly for Anne, James insisted on placing Prince Henry in the custody of John Erskine, Earl of Mar at Stirling Castle, in keeping with Scottish royal tradition.\nIn late 1594, she began a furious campaign for custody of Henry, recruiting a faction of supporters to her cause, including the chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane. Nervous of the lengths to which Anne might go, James formally charged Mar in writing never to surrender Henry to anyone except on orders from his own mouth, \"because in the surety of my son consists my surety\", nor to yield Henry to the Queen even in the event of his own death. \"And in case God call me at any time see that neither for the Queen nor Estates, their pleasure, you deliver him till he be eighteen years of age, and that he command you himself.\" Anne demanded the matter be referred to the Council, but James would not hear of it. The issue remained unresolved and James went north after the Battle of Glenlivet. He wrote to Anne inviting her to join him as he tried to discover the whereabouts of rebel lords. She did not make the journey.\nAnne made plans to make a progress to see the English border in May 1595, but James refused. The controversy over the custody of Prince Henry continued, with public scenes in which James reduced her to rage and tears over the issue. Anne became so bitterly upset that in July 1595 she suffered a miscarriage. Thereafter, she outwardly abandoned her campaign, but it was thought permanent damage had been done to the marriage. In August 1595, John Colville wrote: \"There is nothing but lurking hatred disguised with cunning dissimulation betwixt the King and the Queen, each intending by slight to overcome the other.\" Despite these differences, Anne and James visited the Prince at Stirling in December 1595 and returned to Holyrood Palace to celebrate her 21st birthday.\nThey had six more children. It was said, in May 1597, that Anne was \"careful of no other thing, but to dance and sport\". Anne extended and rebuilt Dunfermline Palace, in 1601 preparing a lodging for her daughter Princess Elizabeth, but the princess remained at Linlithgow Palace on the king's orders. Her younger sons Charles and Robert were allowed to stay with her at Dunfermline and Dalkeith Palace.\nIn February 1603, the French ambassador in London, Christophe de Harlay, Count of Beaumont, reported a rumour spread by James's friends that Anne was cruel and ambitious, hoping to rule Scotland as Regent or Governor for her son after her husband's death. Anne saw a belated opportunity to gain custody of Henry in 1603 when James left for London with the Earl of Mar to assume the English throne following the death of Elizabeth I. At his departure James made a tender public farewell to his wife. Pregnant at the time, Anne descended on Stirling with a force of \"well-supported\" nobles, intent on removing the nine-year-old Henry, whom she had hardly seen for five years; but Mar's wife and his young son would allow her to bring no more than two attendants with her into the castle. The obduracy of Henry's keepers sent Anne into such a fury that she suffered another miscarriage: according to David Calderwood, she \"went to bed in anger and parted with child the tenth of May.\"\nWhen the Earl of Mar returned with James's instructions that Anne join him in the Kingdom of England, she informed James by letter that she refused to do so unless allowed custody of Henry. James's reply indicates that Anne had accused him of not loving her, of only marrying her because of her high birth, and of listening to rumours that she might turn Catholic: \"I thank God,\" he wrote, \"I carry that love and respect unto you which by the law of God and nature I ought to do my wife and mother of my children, but not for ye are a King's daughter, for whether ye were a King's or a cook's daughter ye must be all alike to me, being once my wife.\" And he swore \"upon the peril of my salvation and damnation, that neither the Earl of Mar nor any flesh living ever informed me that ye was upon any papist or Spanish course.\" This \"forceful maternal action\", as historian Pauline Croft describes it, obliged James to climb down at last, though he reproved Anne for \"froward womanly apprehensions\" and described her behaviour in a letter to Mar as \"wilfulness\". Both Barroll and McManus point out that Anne's actions were political as well as maternal; Barroll and McManus elaborate diplomacy and politics went into the hand-over: the governing Council met at Stirling and banned Anne's noble attendants from coming within of Henry; Mar delivered Henry to Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox, representing the king; Lennox delivered him to the Council; the Council handed him over to Anne and Lennox, who were to take him south together. As the Queen travelled south, John Graham, 3rd Earl of Montrose, wrote to James urging him to exercise greater control over her: \"But lest Her Highness' wrath continuing, should hereafter produce unexpected tortures, I would most humbly entreat Your Majesty to prevent the same\u00a0... and suffer not this canker or corruption to have any further progress.\"\nJames wrote to Anne that he had not received accusations from Mar's supporters that her actions at Stirling were motivated by religious factionalism or \"Spanish courses\". He reminded her that she was \"a king's daughter\" but \"whether ye a king's or a cook's daughter, ye must be all alike to me, being once my wife\", and so she should have respected the confidence he, her husband, had placed in Mar. The French ambassador in London, Maximilien de B\u00e9thune, Duke of Sully, heard that Anne would bring and exhibit her embalmed still-born male child in England in order to dispel false rumours about a plot.\nStirling to Windsor Castle.\nAfter a brief convalescence from the miscarriage, Anne travelled from Stirling to Edinburgh, where several English ladies had gathered, hoping to join her court, including Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, and Frances Howard, Countess of Kildare. Anne ordered a new gown of figured taffeta and had her white satin gown refashioned. New clothes were bought for her entourage, and her jester Tom Durie was given a green coat.\nMarmaduke Darrell was sent from London with money for the expenses of her journey and the group of ladies sent by the Privy Council to attend her. Anne duly travelled south with Prince Henry, their progress causing a sensation in England. Princess Elizabeth followed two days later and soon caught up, but Prince Charles was left at Dunfermline, being sickly. Anne kept with her the body of the child she had miscarried.\nShe was met at York on 11 June by Thomas Cecil, Lord Burghley. He wrote to Sir Robert Cecil, \"she will prove, if I be not deceived, a magnifical prince, a kind wife and a constant mistress\". Her large crowd of followers was disorderly and there were quarrels between the Earl of Argyll and the Earl of Sussex, and between Thomas Somerset and William Murray who argued about the role of Master of Horse. The Duke of Lennox and the Earls of Shrewsbury and Cumberland made a proclamation at Worksop Manor that her followers should put aside any private quarrels, and hangers-on without formal roles should leave.\nCourtiers and gentry made efforts to meet her on her journey. Lady Anne Clifford recorded that she and her mother killed three horses in their haste to see the Queen at Dingley. In the great hall at Windsor Castle, \"there was such an infinite number of lords and ladies and so great a Court as I think I shall never see the like again.\" Lady Anne Clifford was thirteen years old at the time.\nAnne and James were crowned at Westminster Abbey on 25 July 1603. The coronation prayers for Anne alluded to Esther, the Wise Virgins, and other Biblical heroines.\nAn English estate and income for the Queen.\nA council was appointed in 1593 by the Parliament of Scotland to look after her landed estates and income. Anne of Denmark's household expenses in Scotland were alleviated by money given to James VI by Elizabeth I. Between July 1591 and September 1594, she received \u00a318,796 Scots. At the end of December 1595, the Queen's council, re-appointed as a financial administration known as the Octavians, gave Anne of Denmark a purse of gold which she then presented to the king as a New Year's Day gift.\nAnne's financial position changed in England when she was awarded a new jointure estate based on lands, manors, and parks which had previously been given to Catherine of Aragon. Administrators, led by Sir Robert Cecil, were appointed in November 1603, while the court was at Wilton House. The yearly income would be \u00a36,376 according to a summary sent by King James to Anne's brother Christian IV for approval in December 1603. Anne wrote to Christian IV, pleased by the comparison with Catherine of Aragon, who was also a king's daughter. An Act for the Confirmation of the Jointure was discussed and read in the House of Commons on 24 May 1604.\nThe estate included Somerset House, the Honour of Hatfield, Pontefract Castle, Nonsuch Palace, and the old palace at Havering-atte-Bower. Robert Cecil had considered other royal dowries, including those of Cecily of York, Mary Tudor, and Mary of France. Thomas Edmondes heard the settlement was \"as much, or rather more, than has been granted to any former King's wife\". The manor of Topsham in Devon included admiralty rights at the port, and in July 1606 (after the sudden death of its owner) she obtained a cargo of tobacco from Venezuela.\nThe English jointure income was to be spent on Anne's clothes and her household wages and rewards. King James would pay the other costs of her household, stable, and food. The Venetian diplomat Scaramelli heard she had received a gift of valuable jewels from James, Nonsuch Palace, and a yearly income of 40,000 crowns. If she became a widow she would be independent of her son, Prince Henry. Anne would be able to grant leases of her English manors. An advisory committee was appointed to manage the property and income in England. She would continue to draw an income from her Scottish jointure properties. A similar commission for her Scottish properties had been appointed in April 1603 under the leadership of Alexander Seton, Lord Fyvie. Henry Wardlaw of Pitreavie was chamberlain of the Scottish lands, comprising the Lordship of Dunfermline, the Earldom of Ross, and Lordships of Ardmannoch and Etrrick Forest, and compiled accounts of the queen's revenue.\nOn 13 February 1610, John Chamberlain wrote that Anne \"hath been somewhat melancholy of late about her jointure, that was not fully to her liking\" and King James had promised additional funds. In the autumn of 1617, King James changed the settlement, giving Anne an additional \u00a320,000, to make \u00a350,0000 yearly, from which she would pay for her household diet and stable if he died before her.\nMarital frictions.\nObservers regularly noted incidents of marital discord between Anne and James. The so-called Gowrie conspiracy of 1600, in which the young Earl of Gowrie, John Ruthven, and his brother Alexander Ruthven were killed by James's attendants for a supposed assault on the King, triggered the dismissal of their sisters Beatrix and Barbara Ruthven as ladies-in-waiting to Anne, with whom they were \"in chiefest credit.\" The Queen, who was five months pregnant, refused to get out of bed unless they were reinstated and stayed there for two days, also refusing to eat. When James tried to command her, she warned him to take care how he treated her because she was not the Earl of Gowrie. James placated her for the moment by paying a famous acrobat to entertain her, but she never gave up, and her stubborn support for the Ruthvens over the next three years was taken seriously enough by the government to be regarded as a security issue. In 1602, after discovering that Anne had smuggled Beatrix Ruthven into Holyrood, James carried out a cross-examination of the entire household; in 1603, he finally decided to grant Beatrix Ruthven a pension of \u00a3200, \"because though her family is hateful on account of the abominable attempt against the King, she has shown no malicious disposition\".\nIn 1603, James fought with Anne over the proposed composition of her English household, sending her a message that \"his Majesty took her continued perversity very heinously.\" In turn, Anne took exception to James's drinking: in 1604 she confided to the French ambassador Beaumont that \"the King drinks so much, and conducts himself so ill in every respect, that I expect an early and evil result.\"\nA briefer confrontation occurred in 1613 when Anne shot and killed James's favourite dog during a hunting session at Theobalds. After his initial rage, James smoothed things over by giving her a \u00a32,000 diamond in memory of the dog, whose name was Jewel.\nSeparate life.\nAnne enjoyed living in London, while James preferred to escape the capital, most often at his hunting lodge in Royston. Anne's chaplain, Godfrey Goodman, later summed up the royal relationship: \"The King himself was a very chaste man, and there was little in the Queen to make him uxorious; yet they did love as well as man and wife could do, not conversing together.\" Anne moved into Greenwich Palace and then Somerset House, which she renamed Denmark House. After 1607, she and James rarely lived together, by which time she had borne seven children and suffered at least three miscarriages. After narrowly surviving the birth and death of her last baby, Sophia, in 1607, Anne's decision to have no more children may have widened the gulf between her and James.\nA funeral and a wedding.\nThe death of their son Henry in November 1612 at the age of eighteen, probably from typhoid and the departure of their daughter Elizabeth further weakened the family ties binding Anne and James. Henry's death hit Anne particularly hard; the Venetian ambassador Foscarini was advised not to offer condolences to her \"because she cannot bear to have it mentioned; nor does she ever recall it without abundant tears and sighs\". The letter writer John Chamberlain suggested that Anne absented herself from the investiture of Charles as Prince of Wales four years later \"lest she renew her grief by the memory of the last Prince.\"\nAt first, Anne had objected to her daughter's match with Frederick V of the Palatinate, regarding it as beneath the royal family's dignity. She did not come to a betrothal ceremony at Whitehall, due to an attack with gout. However, she had warmed to Frederick, and attended the wedding itself on 14 February 1613. She was saddened by the tournaments on the following day, which reminded her of Henry. The couple left England for Heidelberg in April. From this time forward, Anne's health deteriorated, and she withdrew from the centre of cultural and political activities, staging her last known masque in 1614, and no longer maintaining a royal court. Anne's ailments included gout, dropsy, arthritis and swollen feet. Her influence over James visibly waned as he became openly dependent on powerful favourites.\nReaction to favourites.\nAlthough James had always adopted male favourites among his courtiers, he now encouraged them to play a role in the government. Anne reacted very differently to the two powerful favourites who dominated the second half of her husband's English reign, Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset, and George Villiers, the future Duke of Buckingham. She detested Carr, and although acknowledging his marriage in \"The Somerset Masque\", she encouraged the rise of Villiers, whom James knighted in her bedchamber. Archbishop of Canterbury George Abbot and others had pressed Anne to support Villiers's appointment as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber; at first, she refused, saying, according to Abbot's own account, \"if Villiers get once into his favour, those who shall have most contributed to his preferment will be the first sufferers by him. I shall be no more spared than the rest\"; but Carr's enemies nonetheless persuaded the Queen to advocate for Villiers. She developed friendly relations with Villiers, calling him her \"dog\". Even so, Anne found herself increasingly ignored after Buckingham's rise and became a lonely figure towards the end of her life.\nReligion.\nA further source of difference between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the Anglican communion at her English coronation. Anne had been brought up a Lutheran, and had a Lutheran chaplain, Hans Sering, in her household. However, she may have secretly converted to Catholicism at some point, a politically embarrassing scenario which alarmed ministers of the Scottish Kirk and caused suspicion in Anglican England.\nQueen Elizabeth had certainly been worried about that possibility, sending messages to Anne warning her to ignore papist counsellors and requesting the names of anyone who had tried to convert her; Anne had replied that there was no need to name names because any such efforts had failed. Anne drew criticism from the Kirk for keeping Henrietta Gordon, wife of the exiled Catholic George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly, as a confidante; after Huntly's return in 1596, the St Andrews minister David Black called Anne an atheist and remarked in a sermon that \"the Queen of Scotland was a woman for whom, for fashion's sake, the clergy might pray but from whom no good could be hoped.\"\nWhen former intelligencer Sir Anthony Standen was discovered bringing Anne a rosary from Pope Clement VIII in 1603, James imprisoned him in the Tower for ten months. Anne protested her annoyance at the gift, but eventually secured Standen's release.\nLike James, Anne later supported a Catholic match for both their sons, and her correspondence with the potential bride, Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, included a request that two friars be sent to Jerusalem to pray for her and the King. The papacy itself was never quite sure where Anne stood; in 1612, Pope Paul V advised a nuncio: \"Not considering the inconstancy of that Queen and the many changes she had made in religious matters and that even if it might be true that she might be a Catholic, one should not take on oneself any judgement.\"\nCourt and politics.\nIn Scotland, Anne sometimes exploited court factionalism for her own ends, in particular by supporting the enemies of the Earl of Mar. As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state. Henry Howard, active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James that though Anne possessed every virtue, Eve was corrupted by the serpent. Another of James's secret correspondents, Robert Cecil, believed that \"the Queen was weak and a tool in the hands of clever and unscrupulous persons.\" In practice, Anne seems to have been little interested in high politics unless they touched on the fate of her children or friends, and later told Secretary of State Robert Cecil that \"she was more contented with her pictures than he with his great employments.\" However, in November 1600 Robert Cecil had been anxious to find out about correspondence she had with Archduke Albert, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands.\nIn England, Anne largely turned from political to social and artistic activities. Though she participated fully in the life of James's court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of the Stuart dynasty and its Danish connections.\nThe Venetian envoy, Nicol\u00f2 Molin, wrote this description of Anne in 1606:\nAnne's comments did attract attention and were reported by diplomats. In May 1612 the Duke of Bouillon came to London as the ambassador of Marie de' Medici, dowager of France. According to the Venetian ambassador, Antonio Foscarini, his instructions included a proposal of marriage between Princess Christine, the second Princess of France, and Prince Henry. Anne told one of his senior companions that she would prefer Prince Henry married a French princess without a dowry than a Florentine princess with any amount of gold.\nReputation.\nAnne has traditionally been regarded with condescension by historians, who have emphasised her triviality and extravagance. Along with James, she tended to be dismissed by a historical tradition, beginning with the anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th century, which saw in the self-indulgence and vanity of the Jacobean court the origins of the English Civil War. Historian David Harris Willson, in his 1956 biography of James, delivered this damning verdict: \"Anne had little influence over her husband. She could not share his intellectual interests, and she confirmed the foolish contempt with which he regarded women. Alas! The king had married a stupid wife.\" The 19th-century biographer Agnes Strickland condemned Anne's actions to regain custody of Prince Henry as irresponsible: \"It must lower the character of Anne of Denmark in the eyes of everyone, both as a woman and queen, that she\u00a0... preferred to indulge the mere instincts of maternity at the risk of involving her husband, her infant, and their kingdom, in the strife and misery of unnatural warfare.\"\nHowever, the reassessment of James in the past two decades, as an able ruler who extended royal power in Scotland and preserved his kingdoms from war throughout his reign, has been accompanied by a re-evaluation of Anne as an influential political figure and assertive mother, at least for as long as the royal marriage remained a reality. John Leeds Barroll argues in his cultural biography of Anne that her political interventions in Scotland were more significant, and certainly more troublesome, than previously noticed; and Clare McManus, among other cultural historians, has highlighted Anne's influential role in the Jacobean cultural flowering, not only as a patron of writers and artists but as a performer herself.\nPatron of the arts.\nAnne shared with James the fault of extravagance, though it took her several years to exhaust her considerable dowry. In 1593, James appointed a special Council, known as the \"Octavians\", to sort out Anne's accounts and make economies. She loved dancing and pageants, activities often frowned upon in Presbyterian Scotland, but for which she found a vibrant outlet in Jacobean London, where she created a \"rich and hospitable\" cultural climate at the royal court, became an enthusiastic playgoer, and sponsored lavish masques. Sir Walter Cope, asked by Robert Cecil to select a play for the Queen during her brother Ulrik of Holstein's visit, wrote, \"Burbage is come and says there is no new play the Queen has not seen but they have revived an old one called \"Love's Labour's Lost\" which for wit and mirth he says will please her exceedingly.\" Anne's masques, scaling unprecedented heights of dramatic staging and spectacle, were avidly attended by foreign ambassadors and dignitaries and functioned as a potent demonstration of the English crown's European significance. Zorzi Giustinian, the Venetian ambassador, wrote of the Christmas 1604 masque that \"in everyone's opinion no other Court could have displayed such pomp and riches\".\nAnne's masques were responsible for almost all the courtly female performance in the first two decades of the 17th-century and are regarded as crucial to the history of women's performance. Anne sometimes performed with her ladies in the masques herself, occasionally offending or scandalising members of the audience. In Anne's first masque, Samuel Daniel's \"The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses\" of 1604, she played Pallas Athena, wearing a tunic that Dudley Carleton judged too short, because it revealed her legs and feet. Anne commissioned the leading talents of the day to create these masques, including Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones. In \"The Masque of Blackness\" of 1605, Anne performed while six months pregnant, and caused further scandal by appearing, alongside several of her ladies in waiting, with their skin painted as \"blackamores\". Carleton reported that, when the Queen afterwards danced with the Spanish ambassador, he kissed her hand \"though there was danger it would have left a mark upon his lips\". \nAccording to John Webb, Inigo Jones had worked for Christian IV in Denmark before joining Anne's service in England. Jones, a gifted architect steeped in the latest European taste, also designed the Queen's House at Greenwich for Anne, one of the first true Palladian buildings in England, as well as ornamental gateways for her gardens and vineyard at Oatlands. The Sergeant Painter John de Critz decorated a fireplace in her \"tiring chamber\", her dressing room at Somerset House with various colours of marbling and imitation stone, and painted black and white marble in the chapel at Oatlands. In 1618 a passage at Somerset House was decorated with Renaissance style grotesque work, recorded as \"crotesque\".\nThe diplomat Ralph Winwood obtained special greyhounds for her hunting from Jacob van den Eynde, Governor of Woerden. The Dutch inventor Salomon de Caus laid out her gardens at Greenwich and Somerset House. She had a barge for her journeys on the Thames, with glass windows. Anne particularly loved music and patronised the lutenist and composer John Dowland, previously employed at her brother's court in Denmark, as well as \"more than a good many\" French musicians. Between 1607 and her death in 1619 she also employed the Irish harper Daniel Duff O'Cahill.\nAnne also commissioned artists such as Paul van Somer, Isaac Oliver, and Daniel Mytens, who led English taste in visual arts for a generation. Under Anne, the Royal Collection began once more to expand, a policy continued by Anne's son, Charles. With some irony, Anne's servant Jean Drummond compared the queen's reputation to be content among \"harmless pictures in a paltry gallery\" with the Earl of Salisbury's \"great employments in fair rooms\". Drummond's remark contrasts the smaller and more private spaces housing the queen's collection with the halls and presence chambers where statecraft was enacted. Two paintings from her collection are now held by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, depicting \"Christ and the woman at the well\" and \"Christ and the Canaanite woman\".\nShe was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to found a college or university at Ripon in Yorkshire in 1604. The scheme was promoted by Cecily Sandys, the widow of the Bishop Edwin Sandys and other supporters including Bess of Hardwick and Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury. Historian Alan Stewart suggests that many of the phenomena now seen as peculiarly Jacobean can be identified more closely with Anne's patronage than with James, who \"fell asleep during some of England's most celebrated plays\".\nAnne had a surprisingly good relationship with James Montague, one of James's closest aides and Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608 to 1616. Her first visit to Bath may have been timed to coincide with the completion of the re-roofing of Bath Abbey, at the bishop's own expense, and Montague staged a \"Panegiricall entertainement\", probably at the bishop's palace in Wells in 1613, in which the character of Joseph of Arimathea presented the queen with a bough from the Holy Thorn of Glastonbury.\nLater years and illness.\nAnne of Denmark received \"great good\" from recipes provided by Walter Raleigh. The royal physician Sir Theodore de Mayerne left extensive Latin notes describing his treatment of Anne of Denmark from 10 April 1612 to her death.\nFrom September 1614 Anne was troubled by pain in her feet, as described in the letters of her chamberlain Viscount Lisle and the countesses of Bedford and Roxburghe. Lisle first noted \"the Queen hath been a little lame\" as early as October 1611. She was ill in March 1615, suspected to have dropsy. In August an attack of gout forced her to stay an extra week in Bath, her second visit to the spa town for its medicinal waters.\nAlthough she danced at a Christmas masque, said to be \"a good sign of her convalescence\", in January 1616 she moved from Whitehall Palace to Somerset House suffering from gout. King James planned to visit Scotland, and it was said that she dreamed of ruling England as regent in his absence. The Earl of Dunfermline noted in February that \"her majesty looks very well, but yet I think is not perfectly well, she infrequently dresses, and keeps her bedchamber and a solitary life most times.\" James went to Scotland, while Anne stayed at Greenwich Palace and moved to Oatlands in June. She was well enough to go hunting in August 1617. By late 1617, Anne's bouts of illness had become debilitating; the letter writer John Chamberlain recorded: \"The Queen continues still ill disposed and though she would fain lay all her infirmities upon the gout yet most of her physicians fear a further inconvenience of an ill habit or disposition through her whole body.\"\nIn December 1617 the Venetian ambassador Piero Contarini had to wait a few days to get an audience with her because of illness. He described her appearance at Somerset House. She was seated under a canopy of gold brocade. Her costume was pink and gold, low cut at the front in an oval shape, and her farthingale was four feet wide. Her hair was dressed with diamonds and other jewels and extended in rays, or like the petals of a sunflower, with artificial hair. She had two little dogs who barked at the ambassador. Contarini had a second audience with Anne in December and was led through private corridors in the palace by a richly dressed lady in waiting carrying a candle.\nOn 9 April 1618 she was well enough to make a shopping trip incognito to the Royal Exchange, and was discovered, drawing a crowd of onlookers. She had a nosebleed at Oatlands in September 1618 that confined her to bed and disrupted her travel plans. Lucy, Countess of Bedford, thought it had weakened her, and she appeared \"dangerously ill\". In November, a comet was interpreted as a portent of her death, but she was reported to be in good health and had watched a fox hunt from her bedroom window. Lady Anne Clifford recorded that Anne was ill throughout Christmas and missed seeing masque performed at the Whitehall Banqueting House.\nDeath and funeral.\nAnne moved to Hampton Court and was attended by Mayerne and Henry Atkins. In January 1619 Mayerne instructed Anne to saw wood to improve her blood flow, but the exertion served to make her worse. Mayerne attributed the queen's ill-health to her cold and northerly upbringing, and wrote in his notes that as a child she had been carried around by her nurses until the age of nine, rather than allowed to walk.\nJames visited Anne only three times during her last illness, though their son Charles often slept in the adjoining bedroom at Hampton Court Palace and was at her bedside during her last hours, when she had lost her sight. With her until the end was her personal maid, Anna Kaas, who had arrived with her from Denmark in 1590.\nQueen Anne died aged 44 on 2 March 1619, of dropsy.\nDespite his neglect of Anne, James was emotionally affected by her death. James had also fallen seriously ill when Prince Henry was dying. He did not visit her during her dying days or attend her funeral, being himself sick, the symptoms, according to Sir Theodore de Mayerne, including \"fainting, sighing, dread, incredible sadness\u00a0...\". The king \"took her death seemly\". The inquest discovered Anne to be \"much wasted within, specially her liver\". After a prolonged delay, due to a lack of ready money to pay the funeral expenses, the monarchy already being in great debt to its suppliers, she was buried in King Henry's Chapel, Westminster Abbey, on 13 May 1619. John Chamberlain recorded that the funeral procession turned into \"a drawling, tedious sight\", since the noblewomen had to walk such a distance and became so exhausted by the weight of their clothes that \"they came laggering all along\", leaning on the gentlemen for support \"or else I see not how they had been able to hold out\".\nThe catafalque placed over her grave, designed by Maximilian Colt, was destroyed during the English Civil War. Inigo Jones had provided an alternative design for the catalfaque with more complex sculptural symbolism than Colt's.\nAs he had done before he ever met her, King James turned to verse to pay his respects:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLionel Cranfield, as Master of Great Wardrobe, spent \u00a320,000 on the funeral. After the funeral, her French servant Piero Hugon, and Anna, a Danish maiden of honour, were arrested and accused of stealing jewels worth \u00a330,000. Another servant, Margaret Hartsyde, had faced similar charges a decade earlier.\nIssue.\nAnne gave birth to seven children who survived beyond childbirth, four of whom died in infancy or early childhood. She also suffered at least three miscarriages. The physician Martin Sch\u00f6ner attended her pregnancies. Her second son succeeded James as King Charles I. Her daughter Elizabeth was the \"Winter Queen\" of Bohemia and the grandmother of King George I of Great Britain.\nIn literature.\nAnne of Denmark features as a central character in Jean Findlay's historical novel, \"The Queen's Lender\" (2022).\nAnne of Denmark features as a point of view character in Susanna Kearsley\u2019s historical novel \u201cThe King\u2019s Messenger\u201d (2025).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCalendars of State Papers.\nScotland\nVenice"}

The church occupies the site of the ancient chancel and transepts of a large medieval Benedictine abbey, which was confiscated and sacked in 1560 during the Scottish Reformation and permitted to fall into disrepair. Part of the old abbey church continued in use at that time and some parts of the abbey infrastructure still remain.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Benedictine Abbey of the Holy Trinity and St Margaret, was founded in 1128 by King David I of Scotland, but the monastic establishment was based on an earlier priory dating back to the reign of his father King M\u00e1el Coluim mac Donnchada, i. e. \"Malcolm III\" or \"Malcolm Canmore\" (regnat 1058\u201393), and his queen, St Margaret. At its head was the Abbot of Dunfermline, the first of which was Geoffrey of Canterbury, former Prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, the Kent monastery that probably supplied Dunfermline's first monks. At the peak of its power it controlled four burghs, three courts of regality, and a large portfolio of lands from Moray in the north south to Berwickshire.\nIn the decades after its foundation the abbey was the recipient of considerable endowments, as seen from the dedication of 26 altars donated by individual benefactors and guilds where private masses for those benefactors would have been said. The abbey was an important destination for pilgrims because it hosted the reliquary shrine and cult of Saint Margaret from whom the abbey later claimed foundation and for which an earlier foundation charter was fabricated.\nThe foundations of the earliest church, namely the Church of the Holy Trinity, are under the superb Romanesque nave built in the 12th century.\nDuring the winter of 1303 the court of Edward I of England was held in the abbey, and on his departure the following year most of the buildings were burned.\nLater history.\nDuring the Scottish Reformation, the stolen abbey church experienced a first Protestant 'cleansing' by September 1559, and was sacked in March 1560. By September 1563 the choir and feretory chapel were roofless, and it was said that the nave was also in a sorry state, with the walls so extensively damaged that it was a danger to enter. Some parts of the abbey infrastructure still remain, principally the vast refectory and rooms over the gatehouse which was part of the former city wall. The nave was also spared and it was repaired in 1570 by Robert Drummond of Carnock. In 1672 parts of the east end collapsed, while in 1716 part of the central tower is said to have fallen, presumably destabilising much that still stood around its base, and the east gable tumbled in 1726. The final collapse of the central tower took place in 1753.\nThe nave served as the parish church till the 19th century, and now forms the vestibule of a new church. This edifice, in the Perpendicular style, opened for public worship in 1821, occupies the site of the ancient chancel and transepts, though differing in style and proportions from the original structure. Also of the monastery there still remains the south wall of the refectory, with a fine window. Next to the abbey is the ruin of Dunfermline Palace, also part of the original abbey complex and connected to it via the gatehouse.\nDunfermline Abbey, one of Scotland's most important cultural sites has, after Iona, received more of Scotland's royal dead than any other place in the kingdom. One of the most notable non-royal names to be associated with the abbey is the Northern Renaissance poet, Robert Henryson. The tomb of Saint Margaret and Malcolm Canmore, within the ruined walls of the Lady chapel, was restored and enclosed by command of Queen Victoria.\nToday.\nThe current building on the site of the choir of the old abbey church is a parish church of the Church of Scotland, still with the name Dunfermline Abbey. The minister (since 2012[ [update]]) is the Reverend MaryAnn R. Rennie.\nArchitecture.\nThe old building was a fine example of simple and massive Romanesque, as the nave testifies, and has a beautiful doorway in its west front. Alexander I had the two towers built which flanked the great western entrance.\nAnother rich Romanesque doorway was exposed in the south wall in 1903, when masons were cutting a site for the memorial to the soldiers who had fallen in the Second Boer War. A new site was found for this monument in order that the ancient and beautiful entrance might be preserved. The venerable structure is maintained publicly, and private munificence has provided several stained-glass windows. The architecture of the Afghan Church in Mumbai in India (dedicated to St John the Baptist) references the door and the right side of the church of Dunfermline Abbey.\nOther burials.\nIn the Elgin Vault, under the South transept: \nElsewhere:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Trimpey is a recovered alcoholic who works in the field of treatment of alcoholism and other drug addictions. Rational Recovery is a commercial trademark, along with the Addictive Voice Recognition Technique (AVRT). The organization published a periodical, the \"Journal of Rational Recovery\", from at latest 1993 until at least June 2001. The former \"Rational Recovery\" website (\"rational.org\") and a newer website www.avrt.com are now both 'parked' domains.\nProgram.\nThe program (AVRT) is not a form of therapy, counseling, or addiction treatment. Some assistance is free, but the program requires some \"very modest charges\" for goods and services including books, articles, and audio CDs to assist in the recovery process. Much of the material is offered for free via the Internet, and an interested person can begin the Rational Recovery program through the Internet. The Rational Recovery program is based on the premise that the addict both desires and is capable of permanent, planned abstinence. However, the Rational Recovery program recognizes that, paradoxically, the addict also wants to continue using. This is because of their belief in the power of the substance to quell their anxiety; an anxiety which is itself partially substance-induced, as well as greatly enhanced, \"by\" the substance. This ambivalence is the Rational Recovery definition of addiction.\nAccording to this paradigm, the primary force driving an addict's predicament is what Trimpey calls the \"addictive voice\", which can physiologically be understood as being related to the parts of the human brain that control our core survival functions such as hunger, sex, and bowel control. Consequently, when the desires of this \"voice\" are not satiated, the addict experiences anxiety, depression, restlessness, irritability, and anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure). In essence, the RR method is to first make a commitment to planned, permanent abstinence from the undesirable substance or behavior, and then equip oneself with the mental tools to stick to that commitment. Most important to recovering addicts is the recognition of this addictive voice, and determination to remain abstinent by constantly reminding themselves of the rational basis of their decision to quit. As time progresses, the recovering addict begins to see the benefits of separating themselves and their rational minds from a bodily impulse that has no regard for responsibility, success, delayed gratification, or moral obligation.\nWhile nomenclature differs, the methods are similar to those used in \"Cognitive Therapy of Substance Disorders\" (Beck, et al.) and other belief-, attitude- and appraisal-challenging and cognitive restructuring schemes.\nThe RR program is based on recognizing and defeating what the program refers to as the \"addictive voice\" (internal thoughts that support self-intoxication) and dissociation from addictive impulses. The specific technique of Addictive Voice Recognition Technique (AVRT) refers to the practice of objectively recognizing any mental thoughts that support or suggest substance use as AV (addictive voice). This passive recognition allows the practitioner to realize that they don't need to do what the AV says, but can effortlessly abstain. This technique relies heavily on basic semantics, essentially relegating the AV to an objectively recognizable \"it\" and retaining the control and free will of the \"I.\" Rather than saying to oneself, \"I drink\", one can use AVRT to understand that \"I don't want to drink, it (the AV) wants to drink.\" Once this \"separation\" is achieved, and the practitioner has personally experienced that they indeed can observe objectively their own addictive voice, maintaining abstinence is a matter of self-control and becomes a personal choice of free will.\nIn his book, \"Rational Recovery\", Trimpey calls the addict's addictive voice \"the bark of Beast\", \"the Beast\" being the desire for intoxication. He proposes that this is the sole reason why addicts continue their self-destructive ways. Furthermore, by recognizing any feeling, image, urge, etc. that supports drinking/using as \"Beast activity\", the compulsions will fall silent, and the person can eventually regain control over their life and never worry about relapses. Rather than making addiction a lifelong battle, it is much easier to say \"no\" to the addictive voice, than to give in. Moreover, this separation of the rational self from the relentless \"Beast\" will, Trimpey says, enable addicts to always remain aware of the repercussions associated with a single relapse.\nThe notions that internal thoughts support self-intoxication and that the practitioner is in control of the addictive voice have become foundational in \"evidence-based\" treatment schemes at more progressive substance abuse treatment facilities in the US, Canada, Australia and the UK. These facilities base their programs on the success of rational emotive behavior therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive appraisal therapy, and schema therapy for anxiety and depression, as well as for substance abuse.\nComparison with Alcoholics Anonymous.\nWhile Rational Recovery and AA promote abstinence, the programs use radically different strategies. Rational Recovery repeatedly claims that there is no better time to construct a \"big plan\" to abstain from drinking/using than now, and that AA's idea of \"one day at a time\" is contradictory to never using again. That is, Rational Recovery says, if AA proposes that you are never going to drink again, then there isn't a reason to keep track of time.\nCourt-mandated twelve-step program attendance.\nIn the United States, psychologist and lawyer Stanton Peele has encouraged legal action against mandated attendance of 12-step programs, stating an objection to the courts and other government and tax-supported agencies mandating attendance at meetings run by organizations with spiritual or religious content. They interpret state-mandated 12-step program attendance as a violation of the Establishment Clause within the First Amendment. This view has been upheld in \"Griffin v. Coughlin\", \"Grandberg v. Ashland County\", \"Warner v. Orange County Department of Probation\", \"Kerr v. Lind\", and \"O'Connor v. State of California\". In his book, Peele notes the five most popular secular alternatives to AA at the time of publication, namely Rational Recovery, SMART Recovery, Women for Sobriety, Secular Organizations for Sobriety, and Moderation Management.\nReligious neutrality.\nTrimpey asserts that some have accused Rational Recovery of being anti-religious. The Rational Recovery FAQ states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Rational Recovery has voiced the conscientious objections of tens of thousands of persons who have received unwanted, unconstitutional, religious indoctrinations in the course of addiction treatment. To them and others, we provide a program that is free from religion. By advocating for their religious freedom, and identifying the 12-step program as a religion that competes with established religions, we have been accused by some of being irreligious, sacrilegious, or even anti-religious. Ain't so.\nRational Recovery claims to remain neutral on the subject of religion and sobriety. Rational Recovery founder Jack Trimpey explains, \"...Rational Recovery is not interested in having people give up any of their religious beliefs; it's just none of our business what people believe about gods and saints. The only exception here, of course, is when one is 'depending' on a rescuing deity in order to remain sober. If that is one's preference, then AA is an ideal program.\"\nMeetings canceled.\nRational Recovery claims that \"AVRT has made recovery groups obsolete.\" In late 1998, Rational Recovery announced, \"The Recovery Group Movement is Over! . . . Beginning January 1, 1999, all addiction recovery group meetings . . . in the United States and Canada are \"canceled\" and will not be rescheduled.\" Despite those remarks, there are still some groups in existence today, although the numbers are dwindling.\nIn a 1993 research study led by Marc Galanter, former president of both the American Society of Addiction Medicine and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry, attempted to measure the impact of Rational Recovery on members. The research found that \"Rational Recovery succeeded in engaging substance abusers and promoting abstinence among many of them while presenting a cognitive orientation that is different from the spiritual one of AA. Its utility in substance abuse treatment warrants further assessment. The results of the impact on this type of recovery are too few to make an educational assumption.\" This research was conducted before Rational Recovery disbanded their meetings in favor of self-recovery treatment. SMART Recovery split from Rational Recovery just after this research and continues to offer these same groups.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The halo is a zone of radiation damage caused by the inclusion of minute radioactive crystals within the host crystal structure. The inclusions are typically zircon, apatite, or titanite which can accommodate uranium or thorium within their crystal structures. One explanation is that the discolouration is caused by alpha particles emitted by the nuclei; the radius of the concentric shells are proportional to the particles' energy.\nProduction.\nUranium-238 follows a sequence of decay through thorium, radium, radon, polonium, and lead. These are the alpha-emitting isotopes in the sequence. (Because of their continuous energy distribution and greater range, beta particles cannot form distinct rings.)\nThe final characteristics of a pleochroic halo depends upon the initial isotope, and the size of each ring of a halo is dependent upon the alpha decay energy. A pleochroic halo formed from U-238 has theoretically eight concentric rings, with five actually distinguishable under a lighted microscope, while a halo formed from polonium has only one, two, or three rings depending on which isotope the starting material is. In U-238 haloes, U-234, and Ra-226 rings coincide with the Th-230 to form one ring; Rn-222 and Po-210 rings also coincide to form one ring. These rings are indistinguishable from one another under a petrographic microscope.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57122", "revid": "49730707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57122", "title": "Multiplication table", "text": "Mathematical table\nIn mathematics, a multiplication table (sometimes, less formally, a times table) is a mathematical table used to define a multiplication operation for an algebraic system.\nThe decimal multiplication table was traditionally taught as an essential part of elementary arithmetic around the world, as it lays the foundation for arithmetic operations with base-ten numbers. Many educators believe it is necessary to memorize the table up to 9 \u00d7 9.\nHistory.\nPre-modern times.\nThe oldest known multiplication tables were used by the Babylonians about 4000 years ago. However, they used a base of 60. The oldest known tables using a base of 10 are the Chinese decimal multiplication table on bamboo strips dating to about 305\u00a0BC, during China's Warring States period.\nThe multiplication table is sometimes attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras (570\u2013495\u00a0BC). It is also called the Table of Pythagoras in many languages (for example French, Italian and Russian), sometimes in English. The Greco-Roman mathematician Nichomachus (60\u2013120\u00a0AD), a follower of Neopythagoreanism, included a multiplication table in his \"Introduction to Arithmetic\", whereas the oldest surviving Greek multiplication table is on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD and currently housed in the British Museum.\nIn 493\u00a0AD, Victorius of Aquitaine wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in Roman numerals) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were \"a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144.\"\nModern times.\nIn his 1820 book \"The Philosophy of Arithmetic\", mathematician John Leslie published a table of \"quarter-squares\" which could be used, with some additional steps, for multiplication up to 1000 \u00d7 1000. Leslie also recommended that young pupils memorize the multiplication table up to 50 \u00d7 50. \nIn 1897, August Leopold Crelle published \"Calculating tables giving the products of every two numbers from one to one thousand\" which is a simple multiplication table for products up to 1000 \u00d7 10000.\nTables showing all products of numbers from 1 to 10 or 1 to 12 are the sizes most commonly found in primary schools. The table below shows products up to 12 \u00d7 12:\nThe common multi-digit multiplication algorithms taught in school break that problem down into a sequence of single-digit multiplication and multi-digit addition problems. Single-digit multiplication can be summarized in a 100-entry table of all products of digits from 0 to 9. Because 0 \u00d7 \"a\" = 0 for any number a, the rows and columns for multiplication by 0 are typically left out. Multiplication of integers is commutative, \"a\" \u00d7 \"b\" = \"b\" \u00d7 \"a\". Therefore, the table is symmetric across its main diagonal, and can be reduced to 45 entries by only showing entries \"a\" \u00d7 \"b\" where \"a\" \u2265 \"b\", as shown below. The table could be reduced further (to 36 entries) by leaving off rows and columns for multiplication by 1, the multiplicative identity, which satisfies \"a\" \u00d7 1 = \"a\".\nThe traditional rote learning of multiplication was based on memorization of columns in the table, arranged as follows.\nThis form of writing the multiplication table in columns with complete number sentences is still used in some countries, such as Colombia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, instead of the modern grids above.\nPatterns in the tables.\nThere is a pattern in the multiplication table that can help people to memorize the table more easily. It uses the figures below:\nFigure 1 is used for multiples of 1, 3, 7, and 9. Figure 2 is used for the multiples of 2, 4, 6, and 8. These patterns can be used to memorize the multiples of any number from 0 to 10, except 5. As you would start on the number you are multiplying, when you multiply by 0, you stay on 0 (0 is external and so the arrows have no effect on 0, otherwise 0 is used as a link to create a perpetual cycle). The pattern also works with multiples of 10, by starting at 1 and simply adding 0, giving you 10, then just apply every number in the pattern to the \"tens\" unit as you would normally do as usual to the \"ones\" unit.\nFor example, to recall all the multiples of 7:\nIn abstract algebra.\nTables can also define binary operations on groups, fields, rings, and other algebraic systems. In such contexts they are called Cayley tables.\nFor every natural number \"n\", addition and multiplication in Z\"n\", the ring of integers modulo \"n\", is described by an \"n\" by \"n\" table &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. For example, the tables for Z5 are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFor other examples, see group.\nHypercomplex numbers.\nHypercomplex number multiplication tables show the non-commutative results of multiplying two hypercomplex imaginary units. The simplest example is that of the quaternion multiplication table &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;:\nChinese and Japanese multiplication tables.\nThe Chinese multiplication table consists of eighty-one terms. It was historically called the \"nine-nine table\", because in ancient times it started with 9 \u00d7 9: nine nines beget eighty-one, eight nines beget seventy-two, etc. It was known in China as early as the Spring and Autumn period, and survived through the age of the abacus; pupils in elementary school today still must memorize it. A shorter version of the table consists of only forty-five sentences:\nMokkan discovered at Heij\u014d Palace suggest that the multiplication table may have been introduced to Japan through Chinese mathematical treatises such as the Sunzi Suanjing, because their expression of the multiplication table share the character in products less than ten. Chinese and Japanese share a similar system of eighty-one short, easily memorable sentences taught to students to help them learn the multiplication table up to 9 \u00d7 9. In current usage, the sentences that express products less than ten include an additional particle in both languages. In the case of modern Chinese, this is (); and in Japanese, this is (). This is useful for those who practice calculation with a suanpan or a soroban, because the sentences remind them to shift one column to the right when inputting a product that does not begin with a tens digit. In particular, the Japanese multiplication table uses non-standard pronunciations for numbers in some specific instances (such as the replacement of \"san roku\" with \"saburoku\"; indicated in bold below).\nWarring States decimal multiplication bamboo slips.\nA bundle of 21 bamboo slips dated 305\u00a0BC in the Warring States period in the Tsinghua Bamboo Slips (\u6e05\u83ef\u7c21) collection is the world's earliest known example of a decimal multiplication table.\nStandards-based mathematics reform in the US.\nIn 1989, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) developed new standards which were based on the belief that all students should learn higher-order thinking skills, which recommended reduced emphasis on the teaching of traditional methods that relied on rote memorization, such as multiplication tables. Widely adopted texts such as Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space (widely known as TERC after its producer, Technical Education Research Centers) omitted aids such as multiplication tables in early editions. NCTM made it clear in their 2006 Focal Points that basic mathematics facts must be learned, though there is no consensus on whether rote memorization is the best method. In recent years, a number of nontraditional methods have been devised to help children learn multiplication facts, including video-game style apps and books that aim to teach times tables through character-based stories.\nIn 2024, the recommendation to learn the multiplication table was removed from the California Mathematics Curriculum Framework.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57124", "revid": "1008048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57124", "title": "Buddy Bolden", "text": "American cornetist and jazz pioneer (1877\u20131931)\nCharles Joseph \"Buddy\" Bolden (September 6, 1877 \u2013 November 4, 1931) was an American cornetist who was regarded by contemporaries and later jazz scholars as a key figure in the development of a New Orleans style of ragtime music, or \"jass\", which later came to be known as jazz.\nChildhood.\nWhen he was born, Bolden's father, Westmore Bolden, was working as a driver for William Walker, the former employer of Buddy's grandfather Gustavus Bolden, who was born in Louisiana in 1806 and died in 1866. Gustavus was most likely born into slavery, though no definitive records say. His mother, Alice (n\u00e9e Harris), was aged 18 when she married Westmore on August 14, 1873. Westmore Bolden was around 25 at the time, as records show that he was 19 in August 1866. When Buddy was six years old, his father died, after which the boy lived with his mother and other family members. In records of the period the family name is variously spelled \"Bolen\", \"Bolding\", \"Boldan\", and \"Bolden\", thus complicating research. Buddy likely attended Fisk School in New Orleans, though evidence is circumstantial, as early records of this and other local schools are missing.\nMusical career.\nBolden was known as \"King\" Bolden (see Jazz royalty), and his band was at its peak in New Orleans from around 1900 to 1907. He was known for his loud sound and improvisational skills, and his style had an impact on younger musicians. Bolden's trombonist Willie Cornish, among others, recalled making phonograph cylinder recordings with the Bolden band, but none are known to survive.\nMany early jazz musicians credited Bolden and his bandmates with having originated what came to be known as \"jazz\", though the term was not in common musical use until after Bolden was musically active. Jazz historian Ted Gioia has labelled Bolden the father of jazz, though this is quickly qualified: 'even if he did not invent jazz, he had mastered the recipe for it, which combined the rhythms of ragtime, the bent notes and chord patterns of the blues, and an instrumentation drawn from New Orleans brass bands and string ensembles.' In his \"A New History of Jazz,\" Alyn Shipton describes Bolden as having invented 'the music that became jazz.' He is credited with creating a looser, more improvised version of ragtime and adding blues; Bolden's band was said to be the first to have brass instruments play the blues. He was also said to have adapted ideas from gospel music heard in uptown African-American Baptist churches.\nInstead of imitating other cornetists, Bolden played the music he heard \"by ear\" and adapted it to his horn. In doing so, he created an exciting and novel fusion of ragtime, black sacred music, marching-band music, and rural blues. He rearranged the typical New Orleans dance band of the time to better accommodate the blues: string instruments became the rhythm section, and the front-line instruments were clarinets, trombones, and Bolden's cornet. Bolden was known for his powerful, loud, \"wide open\" playing style. Joe \"King\" Oliver, Freddie Keppard, Bunk Johnson, and other early New Orleans jazz musicians were directly inspired by his playing.\nOne of the best known Bolden numbers is \"Funky Butt\" (later known as \"Buddy Bolden's Blues\"), which represents one of the earliest references to the concept of funk in popular music. Bolden's \"Funky Butt\" was, as Danny Barker once put it, a reference to the olfactory effect of an auditorium packed full of sweaty people \"dancing close together and belly rubbing.\" This tune was incendiary in New Orleans at the time: clarinettist Sidney Bechet recalled that 'the police put you in jail if they heard you singing that song.' \nBolden is also credited with the invention of the \"Big Four\", a key rhythmic innovation on the marching band beat, which gave early jazz more room for individual improvisation. As Wynton Marsalis explains, the big four (below) was the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march. The second half of the Big Four is the pattern commonly known as the habanera rhythm developed from sub-Saharan African music traditions.\n&lt;score sound=\"1\" override_midi=\"Big four Buddy Bolden.mid\"&gt;\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\relative c' {\n \\clef percussion\n \\time 4/4\n \u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nPhysical and mental decline.\nBolden had an episode of acute alcoholic psychosis in 1907 at age 30. With the full diagnosis of dementia praecox (today called schizophrenia), he was admitted to the Louisiana State Insane Asylum at Jackson, a mental institution, where he spent the rest of his life. Recent research has suggested that Bolden may in fact have had pellagra, a vitamin deficiency common among poor and black groups in the population, which in 1907 swept through the southern United States. In his essay 'Jazz and disability', George McKay positions Bolden (alongside disabled European guitarist Django Reinhardt) as a pivotal figure in this new music's inclusive capacity: 'Apparently from an edge, the edge of sound mental health or a normal life itself, Buddy Bolden seems to have had a mind that let him hear and create a new music... [His] tantalizing as well as desperate story,\nhis achievements and influence, which are shrouded in silence, is also one of cognitive impairment\nat the heart of the jazz tradition.' Bolden's death on November 4, 1931, was caused by cerebral arteriosclerosis according to the death certificate.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1895\u20131896, Bolden began a relationship with Harriet \"Hattie\" Oliver, a woman several years his senior who lived in the same neighborhood. Their relationship was brief, and though they never married, she gave birth to their son, Charles Joseph Bolden Jr., on May 2, 1897.\nFurther life and legend.\nWhile there is substantial first-hand oral history about Bolden, facts about his life continue to be lost amidst colorful myth. Stories about his being a barber by trade or that he published a scandal sheet called \"The Cricket\" have been repeated in print despite being debunked decades earlier.\nTributes.\nFiction.\nBolden has inspired a number of fictional characters with his name.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a native of Milan and was chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, which collapsed in one of Italy's biggest political scandals.\nCalvi's death by hanging in London in June 1982 is a source of enduring controversy and was ruled a murder after two coroners' inquests and an independent investigation. Five people were acquitted in Rome in June 2007 of conspiracy to murder Roberto Calvi. Popular suspicion has linked his death to allegedly corrupt officials of the Vatican Bank, the Sicilian Mafia, and the Continental Freemasonry lodge Propaganda Due.\nLife and career.\nRoberto Calvi's father was the manager of the Banca Commerciale Italiana (Italian Commercial Bank). Calvi joined the bank after World War II, but he moved to Banco Ambrosiano, then Italy's second-largest bank, in 1947. He married in 1952 and had two children. Soon he became the personal assistant of Carlo Alessandro Canesi, a leading figure and later president of Banco Ambrosiano. Calvi was the bank's general manager in 1971 and chairman in 1975.\nBanco Ambrosiano scandal.\nIn 1978, the Bank of Italy produced a report on Banco Ambrosiano which found that several billion lire had been exported illegally, leading to criminal investigations. Calvi was tried in 1981, given a four-year suspended sentence, and fined US$19.8 million for transferring US$27 million out of the country in violation of Italian currency laws. He was released on bail pending appeal and kept his position at the bank. During his short spell in jail, Calvi attempted suicide. His family maintains that he was manipulated by others and was innocent of the crimes attributed to him.\nThe controversy surrounding Calvi's dealings at Banco Ambrosiano echoed a scandal in 1974 when the Holy See lost an estimated US$30 million upon the collapse of the Franklin National Bank owned by financier Michele Sindona. Bad loans and foreign currency transactions led to the collapse of the bank. Sindona died in prison after drinking coffee laced with cyanide.\nCalvi wrote a letter of warning to Pope John Paul II on 5 June 1982, two weeks before the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, stating that such an event would \"provoke a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in which the Church will suffer the gravest damage.\" The correspondence confirmed that illegal transactions were common knowledge among the top affiliates of the bank and the Vatican. Banco Ambrosiano collapsed in June 1982 following the discovery of debts between US$700 million and 1.5 billion. Much of the money had been transferred through the Vatican Bank, which owned shares in Banco Ambrosiano.\nIn 1984, the Vatican Bank agreed to pay US$224 million to 120 of Banco Ambrosiano's creditors as a \"recognition of moral involvement\" in the bank's collapse. It has never been confirmed whether the Vatican Bank was directly involved in the scandal due to a lack of evidence in the subpoenaed correspondence, which only revealed that Calvi consistently supported the Vatican's religious agenda. Calvi committed the crime of fiscal misconduct, and there was no evidence of church involvement otherwise, so the Vatican Bank was granted immunity.\nDeath.\nCalvi went missing from his Rome apartment on 10 June 1982, having fled the country on a false passport under the name Gian Roberto Calvini, fleeing initially to Venice. From there, he apparently hired a private plane to London via Z\u00fcrich. A postal clerk was crossing London's Blackfriars Bridge at 7:30 am on Friday, 18 June and noticed Calvi's body hanging from the scaffolding beneath. Calvi had five bricks in his pockets and had in his possession about US$14,000 in three different currencies.\nCalvi was a member of Licio Gelli's illegal masonic lodge Propaganda Due (P2), who referred to themselves as \"frati neri\" or \"black friars.\" This led to a suggestion in some quarters that Calvi was murdered as a masonic warning because of the symbolism associated with the word \"Blackfriars\".\nThe day before his body was found, Calvi was stripped of his post at Banco Ambrosiano by the Bank of Italy, and his private secretary Graziella Corrocher jumped to her death from a fifth-floor window at the bank's headquarters. Corrocher left behind an angry note condemning the damage that Calvi had done to the bank and its employees. Her death was ruled a suicide.\nCalvi's death was the subject of two coroners' inquests in London. The first recorded verdict of suicide was in July 1982. The Calvi family then secured the services of George Carman, QC. The second inquest was held in July 1983, and the jury recorded an open verdict, indicating that the court had been unable to determine the exact cause of death. Calvi's family maintained that his death had been a murder.\nIn 1991, the Calvi family commissioned the New York-based investigation company Kroll Associates to investigate the circumstances of Calvi's death. The case was assigned to Jeff Katz, who was a senior case manager for the company in London. As part of his two-year investigation, Katz hired a former Home Office forensic scientist, Angela Gallop, to undertake forensic tests. She found that Calvi could not have hanged himself from the scaffolding because the lack of paint and rust on his shoes proved that he had not walked on the scaffolding. In October 1992, the forensic report was submitted to the home secretary and the City of London Police, who dismissed it at the time.\nCalvi's body was exhumed in December 1998, and an Italian court commissioned a German forensic scientist to repeat the work produced by Katz and his forensic team. That report was published in October 2002, ten years after the original, and confirmed the first report. In addition, it said that the injuries to Calvi's neck were inconsistent with hanging and that he had not touched the bricks found in his pockets. When his body was found, the River Thames had receded with the tide, but the scaffolding could have been reached by a person standing in a boat at the time of the hanging. That had also been the conclusion of a separate report by Katz in 1992, which also detailed a reconstruction based on Calvi's last known movements in London and theorized that he had been taken by boat from a point of access to the Thames in West London.\nThis aspect of Calvi's death was the focus of the theory that he was murdered and is the version of events depicted in Giuseppe Ferrara's film reconstruction of the event. In September 2003, the City of London Police re-opened their investigation as a murder inquiry. More evidence arose, revealing that Calvi stayed in a flat in Chelsea Cloisters just prior to his death. Sergio Vaccari was a small-time drug dealer who had stayed in the same flat, and he was found dead in possession of masonic papers displaying member names of P2. The murders of both Calvi and Vaccari involved bricks stuffed in clothing, correlating the two deaths and confirming Calvi's ties to the lodge.\nCalvi's life was insured for US$10 million with Unione Italiana. His family's attempts to obtain a payout resulted in litigation (\"Fisher v Unione Italiana\" [1998] CLC 682). The forensic report of 2002 established that Calvi had been murdered and the policy was finally settled, although around half of the sum was paid to creditors of the Calvi family who incurred considerable costs during their attempts to establish the cause of his death.\nProsecution of Giuseppe Cal\u00f2 and Licio Gelli.\nIn July 1991, Sicilian Mafia \"pentito\" Francesco Marino Mannoia claimed that Roberto Calvi became the victim of a contract killing because he had lost money belonging to senior Mafia bosses when Banco Ambrosiano collapsed. \nAccording to Mannoia, the killer was Francesco Di Carlo, a \"mafioso\" living in London at the time, on the orders of Giuseppe Cal\u00f2 and Propaganda Due Worshipful Master Licio Gelli. Di Carlo also became a cooperating witness in June 1996 and denied that he was the killer, but he admitted that Cal\u00f2 had approached him to commit the murder.\nAccording to Di Carlo, the killers were Vaccari and Vincenzo Casillo, who belonged to the Camorra from Naples and both of whom were later murdered. In 1997, Italian prosecutors in Rome implicated Cal\u00f2 in Calvi's murder, along with Flavio Carboni, an allegedly mobbed up Sardinian businessman with wide-ranging interests. Di Carlo and Ernesto Diotallevi, a member of the Banda della Magliana, were also alleged to be involved in the killing. In July 2003, Italian prosecutors concluded that the Sicilian Mafia acted in its own interests and to ensure that Calvi could not blackmail them.\nGelli was the master of the P2 lodge, and he received a notification on 19 July 2005 informing him that he was formally under investigation on charges of ordering Calvi's contract killing, along with Cal\u00f2, Diotallevi, Flavio Carboni, and Carboni's Austrian girlfriend Manuela Kleinszig. The other four suspects had been indicted on murder charges in April. According to the indictment, the five ordered the murder to prevent Calvi \"from using blackmail power against his political and institutional sponsors from the world of Masonry, belonging to the P2 lodge, or to the Institute for Religious Works (the Vatican Bank) with whom he had managed investments and financing with conspicuous sums of money, some of it coming from Cosa Nostra and public agencies\".\nGelli was accused of demanding Calvi's death as punishment for embezzling money from Banco Ambrosiano that belonged both to Gelli and to senior figures in the Mafia. The Mafia allegedly wanted to prevent Calvi from revealing that the Banco Ambrosiano had been used for money laundering. Gelli denied involvement but acknowledged that the financier was murdered. In his statement before the court, he said that the killing was commissioned in the People's Republic of Poland. This is thought to be a reference to Calvi's alleged involvement in financing the Solidarity trade union movement at the request of Pope John Paul II, allegedly on behalf of the Vatican. However, Gelli's name was not in the final indictment at the trial which started in October 2005.\nTrials in Italy.\nIn 2005, the Italian magistrates investigating Calvi's death took their inquiries to London in order to question witnesses. They had been cooperating with Chief Superintendent Trevor Smith who built his case partly on evidence provided by Katz. Smith had been able to make the first arrest of a UK witness who had allegedly committed perjury during the Calvi inquest.\nOn 5 October 2005, the trial began in Rome of the five individuals charged with Calvi's murder. The defendants were Cal\u00f2, Carboni, Kleinszig, Ernesto Diotallevi, and Calvi's former driver and bodyguard Silvano Vittor. The trial took place in a specially fortified courtroom in Rome's Rebibbia prison. All five were cleared of murdering Calvi on 6 June 2007. Judge Mario Lucio d'Andria threw out the charges, citing \"insufficient evidence\" after hearing 20 months of evidence. The court ruled that Calvi's death was murder and not suicide. The defence suggested that there were plenty of people with a motive for Calvi's murder, including Vatican officials and Mafia figures who wanted to ensure his silence. Legal experts following the trial said that the prosecutors found it hard to present a convincing case due to the 25 years that had elapsed since Calvi's death. Additionally, key witnesses were unwilling to testify, untraceable, or dead. The prosecution called for Manuela Kleinszig to be cleared, stating that there was insufficient evidence against her, but they sought life sentences for the four men.\nKatz claimed that it was likely that senior figures in the Italian establishment escaped prosecution. \"The problem is that the people who probably actually ordered the death of Calvi are not in the dock - but to get to those people might be very difficult indeed\". Katz said that it was \"probably true\" that the Mafia carried out the killing, but that the gangsters suspected of the crime were either dead or missing. The verdict in the trial was not the end of the matter, since the prosecutor's office in Rome had opened a second investigation by June 2007 implicating Gelli and others.\nIn May 2009, the prosecution dropped the case against Gelli. According to the magistrate, there was insufficient evidence to argue that Gelli had played a role in planning and executing the crime. On 7 May 2010, the Court of Appeals confirmed the acquittal of Cal\u00f2, Carboni, and Diotallevi. Public prosecutor Luca Tescaroli commented that \"Calvi has been murdered for the second time.\" On 18 November 2011, the Court of Cassation confirmed the acquittal. Cal\u00f2 is still serving a life sentence on unrelated Mafia charges.\nFilms about Calvi's death.\nBBC One's programme \"Panorama\" chronicled Calvi's last days and uncovered new evidence which suggested that others had been involved in his death. The 1983 PBS \"Frontline\" documentary \"God's Banker\" investigated Calvi's links with the Vatican and P2, and questioned whether his death was really a suicide. The circumstances surrounding his death were made into the feature film \"I Banchieri di Dio - Il Caso Calvi\" (God's Bankers - The Calvi Case) in 2001. A heavily fictionalized version of Calvi appears in \"The Godfather Part III\" in the character of Frederick Keinszig.\nIn 1990, \"The Comic Strip Presents\" produced a spoof version of Calvi's story under the title \"Spaghetti Hoops\", with Nigel Planer in the lead role, directed by Peter Richardson, and co-written by him and Pete Richens. \"Variety\" magazine described the comedy film \"The Pope Must Die\" (1991) as \"loosely based on the Roberto Calvi banking scandal\". In the 2009 film \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,\" the character of Tony is found hanging alive under Blackfriars Bridge, which director Terry Gilliam described as \"an homage to Roberto Calvi\".\nCalvi is featured in the Italian film \"Il divo\" (2008), a biography of former Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Located in the Jezreel Valley, it falls under the jurisdiction of Megiddo Regional Council. In 2023, it had a population of 944.\nThe kibbutz is located near Megiddo Junction, the intersection of highways 65, from Hadera to Afula, and 66, running from Haifa south to the West Bank. The junction is the site of a bus terminal and a high-security prison. The kibbutz was built 600 metres north-east of the site of the depopulated Arab village of Lajjun, now known as Einot Kobi.\nIn Christian apocalyptic literature, Mount Megiddo, the hill overlooking the valley where the current kibbutz is located, is identified as the site of the final battle between the forces of good and evil at the end of time, known as Armageddon and mentioned in the New Testament in Revelation 16:16.\nGeography.\nThe kibbutz is located near the site of the several Battles of Megiddo and Tel Megiddo, a rich archeological site. According to the Bible, the town was apportioned to the tribe of Manasseh (). In 2005, Israeli archaeologists discovered the remains of an ancient church, perhaps the oldest in the Holy Land, under the grounds of the prison. Authorities are speculating about moving the prison so the site can be accessible to tourists.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nTel Megiddo is considered one of the most ancient settlements in the Middle East. It guarded the western branch of a narrow pass and trade route connecting Ancient Egypt and Assyria. The site was inhabited from approximately 7000 BCE to 586 BCE. The first significant remains date to the Chalcolithic period (4500\u20133500 BCE). The town experienced a decline in the Early Bronze-Age IV period (2300\u20132000 BCE), \nThe city was somewhat revived around 2000 BCE. Following massive construction, the town reached its largest size in the Middle Bronze Age, at 10\u201312 hectares. Though the city was subjugated by Thutmose III, it still prospered, and a massive and highly elaborate palace was constructed in the Late Bronze Age.\nIron Age (biblical era).\nThe city was destroyed around 1150 BCE. The area was resettled by what some scholars have identified as early Israelites, before being replaced with an unwalled Philistine town. When the Israelites captured it, it became an important city. It was destroyed, possibly by Aramaean raiders, and rebuilt, this time as an administrative center for Tiglath-Pileser III's occupation of Samaria. \nIts importance soon dwindled, and it was abandoned around 586 BCE. Since that time, Megiddo has remained uninhabited. Surviving ruins pre-dating 586 BCE have had no new settlements to disturb the ruins. Since then, the town of Lajjun, not to be confused with the el-Lajjun archaeological site in Jordan, was built near the site, but without any new habitation or disturbance of the tell itself.\nOttoman period.\nDuring the Ottoman Period, Lajjun was the capital of Turabay Emirate (1517-1683), which encompassed the Jezreel Valley, Mount Carmel, Beit She'an Valley, northern Samaria, Ramot Menashe, the northern part of the Sharon plain. It was the center of an eponymous Sanjak (district) and one of Palestine' provincial Capitals during the 16th century. Around 1600, the seat of the Turabays moved to Jenin.\nFirst World War.\nThe Battle of Megiddo was fought during World War I. Allied troops, led by General Edmund Allenby fought a defending Ottoman army near the site of the ancient ruin.\nState of Israel.\nThe kibbutz was founded on 2 February 1949 by a gar'in of Holocaust survivors from Hungary and Poland who organized at the end of World War II and fought in the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli war. At first the members settled on the ruins of the Arab village al-Lajjun. Several years later, they relocated to a nearby hill. In 1952 a gar'in of migrants from Lebanon and Mexico joined the kibbutz. In 1959, another gar'in of migrants from Argentina arrived. In the next few years more gar'ins joined and youth organizations volunteered in the kibbutz, but the population did not grow as members left the kibbutz.\nThe kibbutz is featured in a popular Israeli children's story about a puppy named Pluto from Kibbutz Megiddo.\nThe kibbutz had problems developing demographically and economically. The number of residents remained low, with a high turnover of residents until the late 1990s. In November 2000, due to demographic problems and economic instability, members of the kibbutz decided to change the communal lifestyle and structure of the kibbutz in a way that every member is now responsible for his or her own livelihood and the kibbutz provides only some welfare services. Also, the members of the kibbutz decided to transfer the ownership of the housing units and businesses from the kibbutz to the residents.\nIn 2007, two new neighbourhoods were built on the western and northern parts of the kibbutz, with 108 housing units.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nMegiddo is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Olympus was founded on October 12, 1919 as Takachiho Seisakusho by Takeshi Yamashita, initially specializing in microscopes and thermometers, and later in imaging. In 1921, the name Olympus was registered as a trademark. In 1942, the company was renamed Takachiho Optical Industries, and in 1949 it was renamed Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. In 2003, the company adopted its current name, Olympus Corporation.\nOlympus holds roughly a 70 percent share of the global endoscope market, estimated to be worth approximately US$2.5\u00a0billion. As of 2025, endoscopes and related surgical technologies are now Olympus's exclusive product line. It was formerly also a maker of cameras, camera lenses and dictaphones, until it divested this part to OM Digital Solutions in 2020. It divested from its microscopy and scientific imaging division in 2023, which spun off as Evident Corporation.\nIn 2011, Olympus attracted worldwide media scrutiny when it fired its CEO Michael Christopher Woodford for whistleblowing, and the matter snowballed into a corporate corruption investigation with multiple arrests. In 2016, it paid US$million (equivalent to $million in 2024) in fines associated with its illegal, long running, kickback scheme.\nProducts.\nCameras and audio.\nIn 1936, Olympus introduced its first camera, the Semi-Olympus I, fitted with the first Zuiko-branded lens. The Olympus Chrome Six was a series of folding cameras made by Takachiho, and later Olympus, from 1948 to 1956, for 6\u00d74.5\u00a0cm or 6\u00d76\u00a0cm exposures on 120 film.\nThe first innovative camera series from Olympus was the Pen, launched in 1959. It used a half-frame format, taking 72 18\u00d724\u00a0mm photographs on a standard 36-exposure 35mm film cassette, which made Pen cameras compact and portable for their time.\nThe Pen system design team, led by Yoshihisa Maitani, later created the OM system, a full-frame professional 35mm SLR system designed to compete with Nikon and Canon's bestsellers. The OM system introduced a new trend towards more compact cameras and lenses, being much smaller than its competitors and presenting innovative design features such as off-the-film (OTF) metering and OTF flash automation. Eventually, the system included 14 different bodies, approximately 60 Zuiko-branded lenses, and numerous camera accessories.\nIn 1983, Olympus, along with Canon, branded a range of video recording equipment manufactured by JVC, and called it \"Olympus Video Photography\", even employing renowned photographer Terance Donovan to promote the range. A second version of the system was available the year after, but this was Olympus's last foray into the world of consumer video equipment until digital cameras became popular.\nTsuyoshi Kikukawa, who was later to become president of Olympus, foresaw the demand for the digital SLR, and is credited with the company's strategy in digital photography. He fought for commitment by Olympus to enter the market in high-resolution photographic products. As a result of his efforts, Olympus released an 810,000-pixel digital camera for the mass market in 1996, when the resolution of rivals' offerings was less than half. The next year, Olympus hit the market with a 1.41\u00a0million pixel camera. By 2001, the company's annual turnover from digital photography was in excess of \u00a5100\u00a0billion. Olympus manufactures compact digital cameras and is the designer of the Four Thirds system standard for digital single-lens reflex cameras. Olympus's Four Thirds system flagship DSLR camera was the E-5, released in 2010. Olympus is also the largest manufacturer of Four Thirds lenses, under the Zuiko Digital brand. After the introduction of the Micro Four Thirds system, and the general market growth of the Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Cameras, the regular Four Thirds system became neglected. Then, in 2017, after three years without a new lens, and seven years without a new body, Olympus officially discontinued the Four Thirds system\nOlympus and Panasonic started a new development together, called the Micro Four Thirds system. It is an interchangeable lens system, with the Four Thirds sensor size, and no mirrors (Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Camera). The lack of mirrors allowed the camera body to be a lot smaller than that of a DSLR, while maintaining its image quality and the interchangeability of the lenses. The first product in the Micro Four Thirds system was the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1, released in 2008. The first Olympus-branded MFT camera was the Olympus PEN E-P1. Because it was very expensive, they made a cheaper option, called the Olympus PEN Lite E-PL1. The market growth of the MILC cameras made Olympus introduce a new series in their lineup, which was the modern, digital implementation of the legendary OM series, the OM-D. It maintained the Micro Four Thirds system, but added a built-in electronic viewfinder, a more ergonomic button layout packaged in a retro style chassis. The first model in this family was the E-M5, released in 2012. Since then, Olympus has developed their two lines (PEN and OM-D) and the Micro Four Thirds system, still alongside Panasonic. The latest Olympus camera is the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV as of 20 August 2020.\nAt one time, Olympus cameras used only the proprietary xD-Picture Card for storage media. This storage solution is less popular than more common formats, and recent cameras can use SD and CompactFlash cards. The most recent development is Olympus's focus on the Micro Four Thirds system. Olympus has also been using special proprietary USB cables, such as the CB-USB8, instead of following standards.\nOlympus first introduced the Microcassette. The Olympus Pearlcorder L400, released in the 1980s, was the smallest and lightest microcassette voice recorder ever offered for sale, 2.9 (L) \u00d7 0.8 (H) \u00d7 2.0 in. (W) / 73 (L) \u00d7 20 (H) \u00d7 52 (W) .\nIn 2012, the company announced that Sony and Fujifilm had offered forming a capital alliance and the company would focus on Mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILC).\nIn 2020, Olympus announced that the camera department would be sold to Japan Industrial Partners at the end of the year. In October 2020, Olympus transferred its Imaging division to the newly established OM Digital Solutions. On 1 January 2021, 95% of the shares in OM Digital Solutions were transferred to OJ Holdings, Ltd, a specially established subsidiary of Japan Industrial Partners. Olympus retained ownership of the remaining 5%.\nMedical and surgical.\nOlympus manufactures endoscopic, ultrasound, electrocautery, endotherapy, and cleaning and disinfection equipment. The first flexible endoscope in the world was co-developed and manufactured by Olympus in Tokyo. In 1987, KeyMed Medical &amp; Industrial Equipment, a British manufacturer was purchased. With a comprehensive product range, Olympus accounts for a large share of the world market in gastrointestinal endoscopes. It has roughly 70% share of the global market whose estimated valued at US$2.5\u00a0billion. On 28 September 2012, Olympus and Sony announced that the two companies will establish a joint venture\u2014Sony Olympus Medical Solutions Inc\u2014to develop new surgical endoscopes with 4K resolution (or higher) and 3D capability. On 16 September 2015, Sony Olympus Medical Solutions Inc announced that their jointly developed 4K surgical endoscopy system would be commercialized and made available for purchase in early October 2015, and would be sold by Olympus under the brand name \"VISERA 4K UHD\".\nOlympus has acquired the Israeli medical device company Medi-Tate, a move aimed at enhancing its portfolio in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The acquisition, finalized in February 2021, strengthens Olympus' position in the urological devices market.\nMedi-Tate specializes in the research, development, manufacturing, and sale of devices designed for minimally invasive treatment of BPH. Its flagship product, the iTind, is a temporarily implanted nitinol device that alleviates lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with BPH. The iTind procedure can be performed by a urologist in various settings, including outpatient hospital facilities, ambulatory surgery centers, or a doctor's office. The device works by gradually expanding and applying gentle pressure at three specific points, reshaping the prostatic urethra and the bladder neck to provide symptom relief.\nOn 14 September 2022, Sony Olympus Medical Solutions Inc announced that they developed a new model of their 4K surgical endoscopy system, which also allows for Infared imaging and Narrow Band imaging. This new model was made available for purchase in September 2022 by Olympus in Europe, Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia, Oceania and Japan under the name \"VISERA ELITE III\". On 15 January 2024, Canon Medical Systems Corporation and Olympus Corporation announced that they reached an agreement to collaborate on a jointly developed Endoscopic Ultrasound System (EUS) that takes advantage of both companies\u2019 experience in endoscopy and sonography.\nScientific.\nSince the beginning, the company has been a manufacturer of microscopes and optics for specialised needs, such as medical use. The first microscope manufactured at Olympus was called the Asahi. Currently, Olympus is a worldwide renowned manufacturer of microscopes. Olympus offers a complete range of microscopes, which covers applications from education and routine studies up to state of the art research imaging systems, both in life science and materials science.\nOlympus Scientific Solutions Americas Corporation is a Waltham, Massachusetts-based manufacturer, and is a subsidiary of Olympus Corporation. One of its companies, for example, is Olympus Imaging and Measuring Systems, specializing in imaging instruments for testing and measurement during industrial inspections. In April 2022, Olympus Scientific rebranded itself as Evident Corporation, and at first was a wholly owned subsidiary of Olympus corporation. However, a year later, Evident was acquired by Bain Capital.\nIndustrial.\nOlympus manufactures and sells industrial scanners, flaw detectors, probes and transducers, thickness gages, digital cameras, image analysis software, industrial videoscopes, fiberscopes, light sources, XRF and XRD analyzers, and high-speed video cameras.\nCorporate affairs.\nOwnership.\nShareholding in Olympus is dispersed, and the company's key institutional investors are largely passive. As of 31 March 2011, investors included Nippon Life Insurance (8.4%), Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (4.98%), and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking (3.13%), and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (2.55%). Foreign institutions and individuals spoke for 27.71% of Olympus shares. On 28 September 2012, Olympus and Sony announced that Olympus would receive a 50\u00a0billion yen capital injection from Sony. On 22 February 2013, Sony became the largest shareholder (11.46%) of Olympus, later cutting that stake in half during one of its own restructurings, only to sell its entire remaining stake in Olympus, totaling 5% of the company, after a request by activist investor Daniel S. Loeb to do so, in 2019.\nGovernance.\nAccording to its 2011 Annual Report, Olympus was governed by a 15-person board of directors, with Tsuyoshi Kikukawa its president and CEO, and Michael C. Woodford as president and chief operating officer. Mr Kikukawa resigned in the following year and was arrested by Tokyo police for alleged criminal offenses during and before his term as president and CEO. The corporation in 2011 had three \"outside directors\". It had a four-member 'Board of Auditors' which supervises and audits directors' performance. The company's executive committee consisted of 28 members, responsible for the day-to-day operations.\nScandals.\n2011 accounting scandal.\nIn 2011, the company attracted worldwide media scrutiny when it fired its newly appointed English chief executive (CEO) Michael Christopher Woodford, a 30-year Olympus veteran, for probing into financial irregularities and unexplained payments totaling hundreds of millions of US dollars. Although the board initially dismissed Woodford's concerns via mass media as \"disruptive\" and Woodford himself as failing to grasp the local culture, the matter quickly snowballed into a corporate corruption scandal concerning alleged concealment of more than \u00a5117.7\u00a0billion ($1.5\u00a0billion) in investment losses, kickbacks, and covert payments to criminal organizations dating back as far as the 1980s. One of the longest-lasting accounting scandals in Japanese corporate history, the incident wiped out over three-quarters of the company's valuation and led much of the board to resign in disgrace. Investigations were launched across Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, culminating in the arrests of numerous corporate directors, senior managers, auditors, and bankers and raising significant concerns over prevailing standards of corporate governance and transparency, as well as the state of Japanese financial markets. Woodford himself, who stated he had received death threats for his role in exposing the cover-up, was reportedly awarded \u00a310\u00a0million ($16\u00a0million) in damages for defamation and wrongful dismissal. In the wake of this turmoil, Olympus announced plans to shed 2,700 jobs (seven percent of its workforce) and shut 40 percent of its 30 manufacturing plants by 2015. \nOn 1 April 2011, Michael Christopher Woodford, 51, was named president and chief operating officer \u2013 the first ever foreigner to hold the position \u2013 replacing Kikukawa, who became chairman. Woodford, an Olympus veteran of 30 years, was previously executive managing director of Olympus Medical Systems Europa. Olympus appointed Woodford its CEO six months later, but the board suddenly removed him as chief executive two weeks into the job, while allowing him to retain his board seat.\nWoodford alleged that his removal was linked to several prior acquisitions he questioned, particularly the US$2.2\u00a0billion deal in 2008 to acquire British medical equipment maker Gyrus Group. Thomson Reuters reported that US$687\u00a0million was paid to a middle-man as a success fee \u2013 a sum equal to 31% of the purchase price, and which ranks as the highest ever M&amp;A fee. According to the \"Daily Telegraph\", some of the sums paid out relating to the acquisition of a technology company ITX were also under examination. Woodford noted that an article in Japanese financial magazine \"Facta\" in July prompted his suspicion of the transactions. Reports also said the company acquired three other Japanese companies outside its core business, and recognised that the assets were worth US$721\u00a0million less than their acquisition value 12 months previously.\nShareholders expressed concern after Olympus's share price nearly halved in value following the Woodford revelations, and asked for \"prompt action\". Following his dismissal, Woodford passed on information to the British Serious Fraud Office, and requested police protection. He said the payments may have been linked to \"forces behind\" the Olympus board. Japanese newspaper \"Sankei\" suggested that a total of US$1.5\u00a0billion in acquisition-related advisory payments could be linked to the yakuza.\nThe company responded on 19 October that \"major differences had arisen between Mr. Woodford and other management regarding the direction and conduct of the company\u2019s business\". On the Gyrus acquisition, it also declared the Audit Board's view that \"no dishonesty or illegality is found in the transaction itself, nor any breach of obligation to good management or any systematic errors by the directors recognised.\" On 26 October, the company announced that to assuage shareholders' concerns, Kikukawa resigned as chairman; he was replaced by Shuichi Takayama. Olympus shares rebounded 23 percent.\nOn 8 November 2011, the company admitted that the money had been used to cover losses on investments dating to the 1990s and that company's accounting practice was \"not appropriate\", thus coming clean on \"one of the biggest and longest-running loss-hiding arrangements in Japanese corporate history\", according to the \"Wall Street Journal\". The company laid the blame for the inappropriate accounting on ex-president Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, auditor Hideo Yamada, and executive VP Hisashi Mori.\nOn 21 December 2011, Japanese authorities, including the Tokyo prosecutor's office, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police and the Japanese Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, raided the company's offices in Tokyo.\nIn February 2012, seven Olympus executives were arrested by Japanese police and prosecutors. Former president Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, former executive vice president Hisashi Mori, and former auditor Hideo Yamada were taken into custody on suspicion of violating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law, along with former bankers Akio Nakagawa and Nobumasa Yokoo and two others, suspected of having helped the board hide significant losses.\nOn 25 September 2012, the company and Kikukawa, Yamada, and Mori pleaded guilty to collusion to submit false financial reports.\nOn 1 March 2016, Olympus agreed to pay $646\u00a0million of fines to US authorities.\n2024 CEO resignation.\nOn October 28, 2024, CEO Stefan Kaufmann was forced to resign by the Olympus board of directors after allegations of purchasing illegal narcotics. Preceding executive Yasuo Takeuchi was assigned the new CEO. Share prices dropped by 6% following the news. On November 28, a 44-year-old man was re-arrested on drug dealing and extortion charges, allegedly forcing Kaufmann to pay 9,150,000 yen across 23 payments as hush money. Kaufmann was later sentenced by the Tokyo District court to 10 months in prison.

Its Masonic charter was withdrawn in 1976, and it was transformed by Worshipful Master Licio Gelli into an international, illegal, clandestine, anti-communist, anti-Soviet, anti-Marxist, and radical right criminal organization and secret society operating in contravention of Article 18 of the Constitution of Italy that banned all such secret associations. Gelli continued to operate the unaffiliated lodge from 1976 to 1984. P2 was implicated in numerous Italian crimes and mysteries, including the collapse of the Holy See-affiliated Banco Ambrosiano, the contract killings of journalist Carmine Pecorelli and mobbed-up bank president Roberto Calvi, and political corruption cases within the nationwide \"mani pulite\" bribery scandal. P2 came to light through the investigations into the collapse of Michele Sindona's financial empire.\nP2 was sometimes referred to as a \"state within a state\" or a \"shadow government\". The lodge had among its members prominent journalists, members of the Italian parliament, industrialists, and senior Italian military officers \u2014including Silvio Berlusconi, who later became Prime Minister of Italy; the House of Savoy pretender to the Italian throne Prince Victor Emmanuel; and the heads of all three Italian foreign intelligence services (at the time SISDE, SISMI, and CESIS). When searching Gelli's villa in 1982, police found a document which he had entitled \"Plan for Democratic Rebirth\", which called for a coup d'etat, the consolidation of the media, the suppression of Italian labour unions, and the rewriting of the Italian constitution.\nOutside of Italy, P2 had many active lodges in Venezuela, Uruguay, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina. Among its Argentine members were Ra\u00fal Alberto Lastiri, who was briefly interim president of the country after the end of the self-styled \"Argentine Revolution\" dictatorship (1966\u20131973); Emilio Massera, who was part of the military junta led by Jorge Rafael Videla during Argentina's last civil-military dictatorship (1976\u20131983); the Peronist orthodox Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega, who was Minister of Social Welfare (1973\u20131975) and founder of the paramilitary organisation Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA); and former Argentine Army general, Dirty War perpetrator, and convicted murderer Guillermo Su\u00e1rez Mason.\nP2's leader, Gelli, has been recognized in the 2020s as the mastermind behind the 1980 Bologna massacre, the deadliest terrorist attack in post-WWII Italy.\nFoundation.\nWith the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, the Grand Orient of Italy, the most important and numerous Masonic community in Italy, felt the need to safeguard the identity of its most prominent members, even within the organisation. For this reason, the membership of the latter did not appear on any official list, but was known only to the Grand Master, who recorded it as an initiation \"by ear\". It was not until 1877 that Giuseppe Mazzoni began to draw up a list called Propaganda Massonica, officially establishing the lodge in question and becoming its first venerable master.\nPropaganda was founded in 1877, in Turin, as Propaganda Massonica. This lodge was frequented by politicians and government officials from across Italy who were unable to attend their own lodges and included prominent members of the Piedmont nobility. Since its foundation, the main feature of the lodge was to provide adequate cover and secrecy for the most important initiates, both inside and outside the Masonic organisation.\nAdriano Lemmi (Grand Master from 1885 to 1895) was initiated into the Propaganda lodge in 1877 and helped to give it prestige by bringing together members of parliament, senators and bankers who, due to their positions, were forced to leave their local lodges and settle in Rome. During its history, the lodge included important Italian figures, such as the poet Giosu\u00e8 Carducci, politicians Francesco Crispi and Arturo Labriola and journalist Gabriele Galantara.\nEven after Lemmi's Grand Mastership, the lodge continued to be an important reference point in the organisation of the Masonic Grand Orient. Among its members, at the beginning of the 20th, century there were Giovanni Ameglio (1920), Mario Cevolotto, Eugenio Chiesa (1913), Alessandro Fortis (1909), Gabriele Galantara (1907), and Giorgio Pitacco (1909). \nPropaganda Massonica was banned in 1925, alongside all other Masonic lodges and secret societies, by the Fascist regime. The Grand Master Domizio Torrigiani signed the decree dissolving all lodges. However, Italian Freemasonry was reconstituted in exile in Paris on 12 January 1930.\nFollowing the end of World War II, Freemasonry became legal again and the lodge was reformed. The name was changed to when the Grand Orient of Italy numbered its lodges. By the 1960s, the lodge was all but inactive, holding few meetings. This original lodge was only tangentially related to the one established by Licio Gelli in 1966, two years after becoming a Freemason. On the contrary, Giuliano Di Bernardo, former Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Italy, affirmed that \"the cards of the P2 affiliates bore the signature of the Grand Master, therefore they were all effective members of the Grand Orient of Italy.\"\nWith the return of the Grand Orient to Italy, the lodge was reconstituted under the name 'Propaganda 2', for reasons of numbering of Italian lodges imposed by organisational necessity. The lodges resumed their activities, returning to the direct authority of the Grand Master of the Order until the advent of Licio Gelli. During the Cold War, Italian Freemasonry traditions of free-thinking under the transformed into fervent anti-communism. The increasing influence of the political left at the end of the 1960s became a concern to the Masons of Italy. Gelli was first appointed by Lino Salvini, Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Italy\u2014one of Italy's largest Masonic lodges, to represent him in all functions within the lodge (1970), with task of reorganizing P2, then he was appointed Venerable Master, i.e. head in all respects (1975).\nBased on notes from the SISMI and SISDE discovered by magistrate Vincenzo Calia during his investigation into the death of Enrico Mattei, the P2 Lodge was allegedly founded by Eugenio Cefis, who ran it until he became president of Montedison. After the oil scandal, he was replaced by the duo Licio Gelli and Umberto Ortolani. According to other sources, the secret head of the P2 Lodge was former Christian Democrat Giulio Andreotti.\nGelli was initiated into Freemasonry on 6 November 1963, at the \"Gian Domenico Romagnosi\" lodge in Rome. The Parliamentary Commission believes that Gelli had also gained influence in the \"court\" of Argentine General Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n (a photograph shows him at the Casa Rosada with the President and Giulio Andreotti): he was subsequently affiliated with the Hod Lodge by Venerable Master Alberto Ascarelli and promoted to the rank of Master.\nSubsequently, in the \"Garibaldi \u2013 Pisacane di Ponza \u2013 Hod\" lodge, Gelli began to introduce numerous prominent figures, earning the appreciation of his venerable Master, who introduced him to Giordano Gamberini, Grand Master of the Order. Gelli convinced Gamberini to initiate new members \"on the sword\" (i.e. outside the specific Masonic ritual) and to include them in the list of \"covered brothers\" of the P2 lodge.\nGelli took a list of \"dormant members\", or members no longer invited to participate in Masonic rituals, as Italian Freemasonry was under close scrutiny by Christian Democracy (DC) in power through the Pentapartito. Through these initial connections, Gelli was able to extend his network throughout the echelons of the Italian establishment. In 1967, P2 initiated former SIFAR Brigadier-General Giovanni Allavena, who handed Gelli approximately 157,000 confidential files (see \"fascicoli riservati del SIFAR\") on many public persons, including intercepted telephone calls, photographs, correspondence, and private information.\nDiscovery.\nThe activities of P2 were discovered by prosecutors while investigating banker Michele Sindona, the collapse of his bank and his ties to the Sicilian Mafia. In March 1981, police found a list of alleged members in Gelli's house in Arezzo. It contained 962 names, among which were important state officials, important politicians and a number of military officers, including the heads of the three Italian secret services. Future Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was on the list, although he had not yet entered politics at the time. Another famous member was Victor Emmanuel, the son of the last Italian king.\nPrime Minister Arnaldo Forlani (whose was a P2 member as well) appointed a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, headed by the independent DC Tina Anselmi. In May 1981, Forlani was forced to resign due to the P2 scandal, causing the fall of the Italian government.\nIn January 1982, the P2 lodge was definitively disbanded by the Law 25 January 1982, no. 17. In July 1982, new documents were found hidden in the false bottom of a suitcase belonging to Gelli's daughter at Fiumicino airport in Rome. The documents were entitled (\"Memorandum on the Italian Situation\") and (\"Plan of Democratic Rebirth\"), and are seen as the political programme of P2. According to these documents, the main enemies of Italy were the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and the trade unions, particularly the Communist Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL). These had to be isolated and cooperation with the PCI, the second biggest party in Italy and one of the largest in Europe, which was proposed in the Historic Compromise by Aldo Moro, needed to be disrupted.\nGelli's goal was to form a new political and economic elite to lead Italy away from the danger of Communist rule. More controversially, it sought to do this by means of an authoritarian form of democracy. P2 advocated a programme of extensive political corruption: \"political parties, newspapers and trade unions can be the objects of possible solicitations which could take the form of economic-financial manoeuvres. The availability of sums not exceeding 30 to 40 billion lire would seem sufficient to allow carefully chosen men, acting in good faith, to conquer key positions necessary for overall control.\"\nP2's influence.\nP2 was implicated in numerous Italian scandals and mysteries. Opinions about the importance and reach of the P2 differ. Some see P2 as a reactionary, shadow government ready to preempt a takeover of power in case of an electoral victory of the Italian Communist Party (PCI). Among them, there were Massimo D'Alema, President of the Bicameral Commission that aimed to reform the Italian constitution, and the former Italian President Sandro Pertini. Others think it was nothing more than a sordid association of people eager to improve their careers by making powerful and important connections (e.g. the master Indro Montanelli).\nKidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro.\nAccording to the Italian magistrate Gherardo Colombo, Propaganda Due had a role in the kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro because he opened the door to the PCI and Francesco Cossiga was powerless.\n\"Italicus Express\" bombing.\nP2 was also heavily involved in the \"Italicus Express\" bombing (1974). One of the magistrates of the Arezzo Public Prosecutor's Office investigating the massacre, Mario Marsili, was Licio Gelli's son-in-law and, at the time the lists were found (1980), he was found to be a \"dormant\" member of the P2 lodge (card n\u00b0. 506). The Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry declared:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] the Italicus massacre can be attributed to a neo-Fascist or neo-Nazi terrorist organisation operating in Tuscany; that the P2 Masonic lodge instigated the attacks and financed extra-parliamentary right-wing groups in Tuscany; that the P2 Masonic lodge is therefore seriously involved in the Italicus massacre and can even be held responsible in historical and political terms, if not in legal terms, as an essential economic, organisational and moral backdrop.\ntakeover.\nIn 1977, P2 took control of the newspaper, a leading paper in Italy. At the time, the paper had encountered financial trouble and was unable to raise bank loans because its then editor, Piero Ottone, was considered hostile to the ruling Christian Democrats. \"Corriere\"'s owners, the publishing house Rizzoli, struck a deal with Gelli, who provided the money with funds from the Vatican Bank directed by archbishop Paul Marcinkus. Ottone was fired and the paper's editorial line shifted to the right.\nThe paper published a long interview with Gelli in 1980. The interview was carried out by the television talk show host Maurizio Costanzo, who would also be exposed as a member of P2. Gelli said he was in favour of rewriting the Italian constitution towards a Gaullist presidential system. When asked what he always wanted to be, he replied: \"A puppet master\".\nBologna massacre.\nP2 members Gelli and the head of the secret service Pietro Musumeci were condemned for attempting to mislead the police investigation of the Bologna massacre on 2 August 1980, which killed 85 people and wounded more than 200. 2020s investigations, and following prosecutions from the Bologna \"Corte d'Assise\", declared Licio Gelli, along with other P2 members, as the mastermind behind the massacre (the deadliest terroristic attack in Italy after the Second World War).\nBanco Ambrosiano scandal.\nP2 became the target of considerable attention in the wake of the collapse of (one of Milan's principal banks, owned in part by the Vatican Bank), and the suspicious 1982 death of its president Roberto Calvi in London, initially ruled a suicide but later prosecuted as a murder. It was suspected by investigative journalists that some of the plundered funds went to P2 or to its members.\nIRI slush funds.\nP2 was also involved in the Institute for the Industrial Reconstruction's slush funds, about which, during the 9th legislature, it was instituted a parliamentary commission of inquiry.\naccount.\nOne of the documents found in 1981 was about a numbered bank account, the so-called \" account\", at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Lugano (Switzerland). It detailed the payment of US$7 million by the president of ENI, Florio Fiorini, through Roberto Calvi to the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) leader Claudio Martelli on behalf of Bettino Craxi, the socialist Prime Minister from 1983 to 1987.\nThe full extent of the payment became clear only twelve years later, in 1993, during the (Italian for \"clean hands\") investigations into political corruption. The money was allegedly a kickback on a loan which the Socialist leaders had organised to help bail out the ailing . Rumours that the Minister of Justice, Martelli, was connected with the account had been circulating since investigations began into the P2 plot. He always flatly denied them. Learning that formal investigations were opened, he resigned as minister.\nCriminal organization.\nParliamentary Commission of Inquiry.\nAfter the discovery of the lists, Arnaldo Forlani appointed a committee of three wise men (Vezio Crisafulli, Lionello Levi Sandri and Aldo Mazzini Sandulli) to provide cognitive and critical elements on the activities of P2. At the end of 1981, at the behest of the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nilde Iotti, a parliamentary commission of inquiry was set up, led by the Christian Democrat deputy Tina Anselmi. The commission carried out a long analysis to shed light on the Loggia, considered a point of reference in Italy for American secret service circles intending to keep Italian political life under control to the point, if necessary, of promoting specific constitutional reforms or organising a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\". The commission \u2013 which concluded its work in 1984 \u2013 produced six reports. \nThe Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, headed by Anselmi, concluded that the P2 lodge was a secret criminal organization. Allegations of surreptitious international relationships, mainly with Argentina (Gelli repeatedly suggested that he was a close friend of Juan Per\u00f3n) and with some people suspected of affiliation with the US Central Intelligence Agency, were also partly confirmed. Soon a political debate overtook the legal level of the analysis. The majority report said that P2 action resulted in \"the pollution of the public life of a nation. It aimed to alter, often in decisive fashion, the correct functioning of the institutions of the country, according to a project which ... intended to undermine our democracy.\" A minority report by Massimo Teodori concluded that P2 was not just an abnormal outgrowth from an essentially healthy system, as upheld by the majority report, but an inherent part of the system itself.\nThe P2 was also investigated by the Commission for Mass Murders for alleged involvement in some massacres, but this led to nothing relevant. The members of P2 and Gelli were fully acquitted of the charges of \"conspiracy against the State\" by the Court of Assizes and the Court of Assizes of Appeal in Rome between 1994 and 1996.\nNew Italian law prohibiting \"secret lodges\".\nEven though outlawed by Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in 1925, Masonic institutions have been tolerated in Italy since the end of World War II and have been quite open about their activities and membership. A special law was issued that prohibited secret lodges, i.e. those whose locations and dates of meeting are secret, like Gelli's pseudo-Masonic association. The , after taking disciplinary action against members with P2 connections, distanced itself from Gelli's lodge. Other laws introduced a prohibition on membership in allegedly secret organizations for some categories of state officials (especially military officers). These laws were questioned by a case from the European Court of Human Rights in 2013. Following an action brought by a serving British naval officer, the European Court has established as precedent the illegality of any member nation attempting to ban Masonic membership for military officers, as a breach of their human rights.&lt;ref name=\"European Court of Human Rights (26740/02)\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nLicio Gelli's 1981 list.\nOn 17 March 1981, a list composed by Licio Gelli was found in his country house (Villa Wanda). The list should be is a combination of P2 members and the contents of Gelli's Rolodex. Many on the list were apparently never asked if they wanted to join P2, and it is unknown to what extent the list includes members who were formally initiated into the lodge. Since 1981, some of those on the list have demonstrated their distance from P2 to the satisfaction of the Italian legal system.\nOn 21 May 1981, the Italian government released the list. The Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry headed by Tina Anselmi considered the list reliable and genuine. It decided to publish the list in its concluding report, .\nThe list contains 962 names (including Gelli's). It has been claimed that at least 1,000 names may still be secret, as the membership numbers begin with number 1,600, which suggests that the complete list has not yet been found. The list included all of the heads of the secret services, 195 officers of the different military and security forces (12 generals of the Carabinieri, five of the financial police Guardia di Finanza, 22 of the army, four of the air force, and eight admirals), as well as 44 members of parliament, three ministers and a secretary of a political party, leading magistrates, a few prefects and heads of police, bankers and businessmen, civil servants, journalists and broadcasters. Included were a top official of the Banco di Roma, Italy's third-largest bank at the time, and a former director-general of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the country's largest bank. The political deputies on the list spanned most of the political spectrum, including the socialist PSI and PSDI, the centrist DC, PRI and PLI as well as the far-right MSI; the communist PCI was the only major political force not represented on the list.\nAfter the list was discovered, the Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani waited until 21 May 1981, before making public the list of P2 members, which included the names of two ministers then in office (the socialist Enrico Manca, and the Christian Democrat Franco Foschi) and five undersecretaries (Costantino Belluscio of the PSDI, Pasquale Bandiera of the PRI, Francesco Fossa of the PSI, Rolando Picchioni of the DC and Anselmo Martoni of the PSDI, the latter however mentioned as \"asleep\", i.e. resigned).\nAmong the 962 people listed as members of the Masonic lodge were politicians, businessmen, lawyers, company directors and, above all, members of the Italian armed forces and the Italian secret services. Michele Sindona himself appeared on the list of P2 members, confirming the suspicions of the investigating judges. Colonel Bianchi resisted various attempts at intimidation, as most of the people mentioned were still in power, and forwarded the list to the competent authorities. Among the generals, the press repeatedly mentioned Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa, although there was only a registration form signed by him and no evidence of active membership.\nRegarding the secret services, it was noted that not only the chiefs were registered (among them Vito Miceli, head of the SIOS and later director of the SID, Giuseppe Santovito of the SISMI, Walter Pelosi of the CESIS and Giulio Grassini of the SISDE) who were politically appointed, but also the most important officials with a consolidated internal career. Among these, the following stood out: General Giovanni Allavena (responsible for the SIFAR files), Colonel Giovanni Minerva (manager of the intricate case of the military aeroplane Argo 16 and considered one of the most important men in the entire post-war military service) and General Gianadelio Maletti, who along with Captain Antonio Labruna (also a member) was suspected of colluding with the subversive cells of Franco Freda and for this reason tried and convicted of aiding and abetting.\nThe hypothesis was put forward that the list found in Gelli's villa was not the complete list, and that many other names managed to avoid being implicated. In the parliamentary commission's reconstruction, to the 962 on the list found, one would have to add the alleged members of that occult circle of which Gelli was supposedly the link with the lodge. Gelli himself, as also highlighted by the Anselmi Commission, in an interview in 1976, had spoken of more than two thousand four hundred members.\nAccording to the prosecutor of Rome at the time, there were a total of 2000 members on the two lists, while on 29 May 1977 the weekly magazine \"L'Espresso\" wrote: \u00abP2 Lodge... It is the most compact and powerful nucleus of the Freemasons of Palazzo Giustiniani: it has 2400 members, the cream of finance, bureaucracy, the Armed Forces, the state's boyars, listed in a coded archive... Gelli, a regular interlocutor of the highest offices of the State (he often sees Andreotti and is received at the Quirinale), is listened to as an advisor to the top brass of the Armed Forces, with trusted and devoted friends in the judiciary\u00bb.\nGelli himself, commenting on the presence of numerous P2 members in the committees of experts that dealt with the kidnapping of Aldo Moro (March\u2013May 1978), stated that the presence of a large number of lodge members in these committees was due to the fact that at the time many prominent personalities were members, so it was natural that several of them would be found in these committees. Gelli claimed that the members were not normally aware of the identity of the other members, but that the existence of the P2 Lodge was well known, having also been discussed in several interviews well before the list was discovered.\nHypotheses were made about who the occult head of the organisation could be, Roberto Calvi's widow declared that Giulio Andreotti was the real head of the lodge, while the role of vice-president was supposedly held by Francesco Cosentino (who was registered on the P2 list with membership card number 1618): however, no reliable evidence has ever been found to confirm this statement. Nara Lazzerini, for many years Licio Gelli's secretary and lover, also stated in 1981 and 1995 before magistrates that it was said in the lodge that the real boss was Giulio Andreotti:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gelli told me that among the members of his Masonic Lodge P2 was the Honourable Mr Andreotti [...]. I remember that in the P2 environment it was said that the real boss was Andreotti and not Gelli. I remember, in particular, that during a lunch in Florence, William Rosati and Ezio Giunchiglia told me that the real manoeuvring force was Andreotti and that they did everything with Andreotti [...].\u2014\u200a\nRosati and Giunchiglia were two regional leaders of Lodge P2: the first was the manager of a private clinic and head of the P2 group for Liguria with sympathies for the extreme right (membership card no. 1906, died in 1984); the second official of the Ministry of Defence (card no. 1508) for the provinces of Pisa and Livorno. Daffodil during the trial Gelli pi\u00f9 622 was defined by PM Elisabetta Cesqui as a character who was \"in the area of greatest shadow of P2, between the side of contacts with the US military and intelligence environments and the one that leads back to the arms trade.\" During the trial for the massacre in Bologna, Lia Bronzi Donati, Grand Master of the traditional female Masonic lodge (and the most important, and perhaps the only, female figure in the Masonic world at the time), told the magistrates who were questioning her as a witness that the list of P2 members consisted of at least 6,000 names and that Andreotti was the presence above the P2 Lodge\": this information was confided to him by William Rosati \"who became the moral reference of P2 after the seizure of the lists\".\nAndreotti, for his part, had always denied knowing Gelli, until the publication of the aforementioned photo of Buenos Aires. Licio Gelli, for whom the judiciary issued an arrest warrant on 22 May 1981 for violation of art. 257 of the penal code (political or military espionage), temporarily took refuge in Uruguay.\nNotable people on Gelli's list.\nNotable individuals include:\n Environmental Heritage (1976\u20131978) and Minister of Public Education and Universities (1978\u20131979).\nRelationships with the regular Freemasonry.\nAccording to , former Venerable Master of the Grand Orient of Italy, \"until its dissolution in 1982 due to the Anselmi-Spadolini law, [P2] was a regular lodge of the Grand Orient of Italy, as attested by extensive documentation that passed between the grand masters Gamberini, Salvini and Battelli on the one hand and Licio Gelli on the other.\"\nExpulsion.\nThe Grand Orient of Italy officially expelled Gelli and the P2 lodge in 1976. In 1974, it was proposed that P2 be erased from the list of lodges by the Grand Orient of Italy, and the motion carried overwhelmingly. The following year a warrant was issued by the Grand Master for a new P2 lodge. It seems the Grand Orient in 1976 had only suspended the lodge, and not actually expelled it, on Gelli's request. Gelli was found to be active in the Grand Orient's national affairs two years later, financing the election of a new Grand Master. In 1981, a Masonic tribunal decided that the 1974 vote did mean the lodge had factually ceased to exist and that Gelli's lodge had therefore been masonically and politically illegal since that time.\nConsequences and judicial investigations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;P2 was dissolved by law, but its system of political, financial and criminal relations may have survived [...] As for Dr Berlusconi, his current interventionism is symptomatic of the reaction of a part of the old regime which, having accumulated wealth and power in the eighties, intends to continue to influence political life in the nineties as well.\u2014\u200a\nThe Court of Cassation decided that the Gelli case was the responsibility of the Rome Public Prosecutor's Office, from which he was accused only of fraudulent activity and false pretences. In May 1983, the case against the P2 leaders was closed. Later, Judge Gherardo Colombo declared that if the investigation had remained in Milan, \"Bribesville\" would have erupted a decade earlier, given the amount of information in Gelli's papers.\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office of Rome began proceedings against Licio Gelli and about twenty other people, accused of political conspiracy, criminal association and other crimes. After an investigation that lasted almost ten years, in October 1991, the investigating judge at the Criminal Court of Rome requested that they be sent for trial. The trial lasted a year and a half and with the sentence on 16 April 1994, filed the following 26 July, the Court pronounced a sentence of acquittal of all the accused of the crime of attacking the Constitution through political conspiracy because the fact did not exist. The appeal was rejected, and on 27 March 1996, the Court of Appeal confirmed the sentence. Although subsequent judicial inquiries have (not without receiving criticism from many quarters) partly denied the conclusions of the commission of inquiry, tending to reduce the influence of the lodge, the discovery of the P2 case made people in Italy aware of the existence, in other systems and in other countries, of lobbying, i.e. the exertion of political pressure on those in positions of power to influence the choices made in the running of the nation in a direction favourable to the lobbyists.\nIn 1987, Licio Gelli was sentenced to 8 years in prison by the Court of Assizes of Florence for having financed members of the Tuscan extreme right, involved in the attacks on the Florence-Bologna railway line. Two years later, on appeal, the judges declared that they did not have to proceed against the accused because, at the time of his extradition from Switzerland, political offences had been excluded. The Supreme Court ordered a new trial, stating that Gelli should have been fully acquitted. On 9 October 1991, the Court of Assizes of Appeal of Florence acquitted him with a broad formulation.\nOn 23 November 1995, Gelli was definitively convicted of misleading the court in the trial for the massacre in Bologna that took place on 2 August 1980, in which 85 people were killed and 200 were injured. The misdirection was carried out, in collaboration with the SISMI general Pietro Musumeci (a member of P2), the Carabinieri colonel Giuseppe Belmonte and the wheeler-dealer Francesco Pazienza, by placing a suitcase loaded with weapons, explosives, ammunition, flight tickets and false documents on the Taranto-Milan train on 13 January 1981. Gelli was also found guilty of fraud regarding the bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano, which was connected to the Vatican bank, the Istituto per le Opere di Religione (IOR) (there was a $1.3 billion hole in the bank).\nOver time, equal attention has been paid to the fate of the \"piduisti\", some of whom have been publicly successful in politics or entertainment, while others have returned to anonymity. Some have been freed from the social stigma (Silvio Berlusconi successfully entered politics, becoming Prime Minister four times in 15 years; Fabrizio Cicchitto returned to politics; Maurizio Costanzo made a self-defence speech and maintained his career as a journalist). Berlusconi himself declared to Iceberg (a political programme broadcast on Telelombardia): \"I have never been part of P2. And in any case, according to the sentences of the Republic's courts, being a P2 member is not a demerit. [...] I read about these projects later. A set-up: P2 was a scoop that made the fortune of \"La Repubblica\" and \"L'Espresso\", it was an exploitation that unfortunately destroyed many protagonists of the political, cultural and journalistic life of our country.\" Massimo D'Alema, ther then Prime Minister, replied: \"Being a member of the Pide means having participated in an organisation, a secret sect that plotted against the State, and this has been ratified by Parliament. An opinion that I share.\"\nFrom 2007 onwards, Licio Gelli was placed under house arrest in his villa Wanda in Arezzo, to serve a 12-year sentence for the Banco Ambrosiano's bankruptcy. In an interview with la Repubblica on September 28, 2003, during the Berlusconi II government, he said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am enjoying a peaceful old age. Every morning I talk to the voices of my conscience, and it is a dialogue that calms me. I look at the country, I read the newspapers and I think: here it is, everything is being realised little by little, piece by piece. Maybe yes, I should have the copyright. Justice, TV, public order. I wrote it all thirty years ago in 53 points.\nSubversive programme \"Plan of Democratic Rebirth\".\nIt was immediately realised that the seized documents testified to the existence of an organisation that aimed to take possession of the organs of state power in Italy: the \"Plan for Democratic Rebirth\" (), a document halfway between a manifesto and a feasibility study that was seized a few months later from Gelli's daughter, contained a sort of roadmap for the penetration of the lodge's members into key sectors of the State, indications for the start of selected proselytising and, appropriately, also a budget estimate of the costs for the acquisition of the vital functions of power: \"The availability of funds not exceeding 30 or 40 billion seems sufficient to allow well-selected men of good faith to conquer the key positions necessary for their control.\"\nThe primary objectives were the reorganisation of the State under the banner of anti-communist and anti-socialist authoritarianism, accompanied by a selective and class-based approach to social structures. Among the main points of the plan was the simplification of the political panorama with the presence of two large macro-parties, bringing the magistracy under the control of the executive power, separating the careers of magistrates, overcoming the bicameral system and reducing the number of parliamentarians, abolishing the provinces, breaking the unity of the trade unions and reforming the labour market, control over the mass media, transforming the universities in Italy into foundations under private law, abolishing the legal validity of academic qualifications and adopting a repressive policy against petty crime and political opponents.\nThe people to be \"recruited\" into the parties would in exchange have to obtain \"predominance\" (textual) over their own organisations (in the plan it states \"for the PSI, for example, Mancini, Mariani and Craxi; for the PRI: Visentini and Bandiera; for the PSDI: Orlandi and Amidei; for the DC: Andreotti, Piccoli, Forlani, Gullotti and Bisaglia; for the PLI: Cottone and Quilleri; for the Destra Nazionale (possibly): Covelli\"), while the \"recruited\" journalists were supposed to \"sympathise\" with the men recommended by the Masonic lodge. Some of the politicians mentioned went on to play leading roles in their parties and in the government, but these personalities were considered \"to be recruited\". However, it has never been clearly established whether Gelli contacted them to pursue the aims of P2.\nFrom the content of the Plan of Democratic Rebirth (according to the texts available on the web) there can be summarized some points of subversive reformas:\nEconomic and social measures.\nReform of the labour market;\nTrade unions.\nThe first objective is linked to the issue of the insufficient definition of clear boundaries and the overlapping of powers, which weaken the State. For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The shift of the centres of real power from Parliament to the unions and from the Government to multinational employers, with the corresponding instruments of financial action.\nThe two objectives are achieved with two hypotheses:\nMedium and long-term measures.\nAbout the role of the press:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;which should be solicited at the level of journalists through a selection that mainly touches: \"Corriere della Sera\", \"Il Giorno\", \"Il Giornale\", \"La Stampa\", \"Il Resto del Carlino\", \"Il Messaggero\", \"Il Tempo\", \"Roma\", \"Il Mattino\", \"La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno\", il \"Giornale di Sicilia\" for newspapers; and for magazines: \"L'Europeo\", \"L'Espresso\", \"Panorama\", \"Epoca\", \"Oggi\", \"Gente\", \"Famiglia Cristiana\". And don't forget RAI-TV.\nImplementation.\nAlthough the P2 lodge was formally dissolved, many of its former members (some of whose names were not included in the published lists) continued for decades to operate and hold prominent roles in politics, the judiciary, the economy, banking systems, among others, and in cooperation with Roman Catholic bishops and high prelates who were operating in Italy in the same years. Mgr. Marcel Lefebvre suggested the existence of a Masonic Lodge in the Vatican with close relationships to other regular Masonic obediences.\nThe progressive implementation of the Plan of Democratic Rebirth has been detailed by some Italian media.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its different types are variously known as gram, Bengal gram, chana dal, garbanzo, garbanzo bean, or Egyptian pea. It is one of the earliest cultivated legumes, the oldest archaeological evidence of which was found in Syria.\nChickpeas are high in protein. The chickpea is a key ingredient in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines, used in hummus, and, when soaked and coarsely ground with herbs and spices, then made into patties and fried, falafel. As an important part of Indian cuisine, it is used in salads, soups, stews, and curries. In 2023, India accounted for 75% of global chickpea production.\nEtymology.\nChickpeas have been cultivated for at least ten thousand years. Cultivation spread from the Fertile Crescent eastward toward South Asia and into Europe through the Balkans. Historical linguistics have found ancestral words relating to chickpeas in the prehistoric Proto-Indo-European language family that evolved into the Indo-European languages. The Proto-Indo-European roots and that denoted both 'pea' and 'oat' appeared in the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe between 4,500 and 2,500 BCE. As speakers of the language became isolated from each other through the Indo-European migrations, the regional dialects diverged due to contact with other languages and dialects, and transformed into the known ancient Indo-European languages. The Old Prussian word , appearing between 1 and 100 CE, retained the 'pea' meaning of the word, but in most cases, the word came to be used to denote chickpeas. In Old Macedonian, the word appeared between 1000 and 400 BCE, and may have evolved from the Proto-Hellenic word . In Ancient Rome, the Latin word for chickpeas appeared around 700 BCE, and is probably derived from the word used by the Pelasgians that inhabited north Greece before Greek-speaking tribes took over. The Old Armenian word for chickpeas appeared before 400 CE. Over time, linkages between languages led to other descendant words, including the Albanian word , the Swedish word , the Slovak word , the Estonian word , the Basque word , and the Maltese word .\nThe Latin word evolved into words for chickpeas in nearly all extinct and living Romance languages, including the Mozarabic word ; the Catalan words , , , and ; the Walloon words ; the Old French words and ; and the Modern French terms , , and . These words were borrowed by many geographically neighboring languages, such as the French term becoming in Old English. The word \"pease\", like the modern words for wheat and corn, was both singular and plural, but since it had an \"s\" sound at the end of it which became associated with the plural form of nouns, English speakers by the end of the 17th century were starting to refer to a single grain of pease as a \"pea\".\nOther important Proto-Indo-European roots relating to chickpeas are , , and , which were used to denote both the kernel of a legume and a pea. This root evolved into the Greek word , mentioned in \"The Iliad\" in around 800 BCE and in \"Historia Plantarum\" by Theophrastus, written between 350 and 287 BCE. The Portuguese words and ; the Asturian word ; the Galician word ; the French words , , and ; and the Spanish word are all related to the Greek term. In American English, the term \"garbanzo\" to refer to the chickpea appeared in writing as early as 1759, and the seed is also referred to as a garbanzo bean.\nTaxonomy.\nChickpea (\"Cicer arietinum\") is a member of the genus \"Cicer\" and the legume family, Fabaceae. Carl Linnaeus described it in the first edition of \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753, marking the first use of binomial nomenclature for the plant. Linnaeus classified the plant in the genus \"Cicer\", which was the Latin term for chickpeas, crediting Joseph Pitton de Tournefort's 1694 publication which called it \"Cicer arietinum\". Tournefort himself repeated the names of the plant that had been used since antiquity.\nThe specific epithet \"arietinum\" is based on the shape of the seed resembling the head of a ram. In Ancient Greece, Theophrastus described one of the varieties of chickpea called \"rams\" in \"Historia Plantarum\". The Roman writer on agriculture Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella wrote about chickpeas in the second book of \"De re rustica\", published in about 64 CE, and said that the chickpea was called \"arietillum\". Pliny the Elder expanded further in \"Naturalis Historia\" that this name was due to the seed's resemblance to the head of a ram.\n\"Cicer arietinum\" is the type species of the genus. The wild species \"C. reticulatum\" is interfertile with \"C. arietinum\" and is considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated species. \"Cicer echinospermum\" is also closely related and can be hybridized with both \"C. reticulatum\" and \"C. arietinum\", but generally produce infertile seeds.\nHistory.\nThe chickpea was originally domesticated along with wheat, barley, peas, and lentils during the First Agricultural Revolution about 10,000 years ago. The closest evolutionary relative to chickpeas is \"Cicer reticulatum\", a plant native to a relatively small area in the Southeastern part of modern-day Turkey and nearby areas in modern-day Syria. Initially, ancient hunter-gatherer cultures harvested wild plants that they encountered, but evidence of the cultivation of some domestic food crops from 7500 BCE and possibly earlier have been documented.\nArchaeological sites in modern Syria, such as Tell El-Kerkh and Tell Abu Hureyra, have revealed remnant traces of peas, lentils, and fava beans, along with grain legumes including chickpeas, bitter vetch, and grass peas from the 8th millennium BCE. Samples from Tell El-Kerkh have been analyzed, revealing traces of both the cultivated \"C. arietinum\" and the wild \"C. reticulatum\". Additional discoveries have been made at \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc in Turkey dating from between 7500 and 6800 BCE, and at Hacilar in Turkey that date from 5450 BCE.\nCultivation of domesticated chickpea is well documented from 3300 BCE onwards in Egypt and the Middle East. During the Neolithic Era, chickpea cultivation spread to the west and was established in present-day Greece by the late Neolithic Era. During the Bronze Age, chickpea cultivation spread to Crete and as far as upper Egypt, with specimens from 1400 BCE found at Deir el-Medina. At the same time, it spread to the east, and chickpeas from 1900 BCE were found at Tell Bazmusian. In the Indian subcontinent, archaeological evidence of chickpea cultivation at Lal Quila, Sanghol, Inamgaon, Nevasa, Hulas, Senuwar, and Daimabad date from between 1750 and 1500 BCE. By the Iron Age, cultivation had spread as far south as Lalibela in Ethiopia. The Spanish and Portuguese introduced chickpea cultivation to the New World in the 16th century.\nThe process of domestication involved the selective breeding of plants that produced large, palatable seeds that do not require a dormancy period, plants that have seeds that are easy to separate from the pods, plants with a predictable ripening period to allow a whole field to ripen at once, and plants with desirable physical forms. This selective breeding produced several different varieties of chickpeas. In Greece, Theophrastus wrote \"Chickpeas... differ in size, color, taste, and shape; there are the varieties called 'rams' and 'vetch-like' chickpeas, and the intermediate forms\" in \"Historia Plantarum\", written between 350 and 287 BCE. \nOne key selection factor in the domestication of chickpeas was the selection of a spring-sown cropping season. The evolutionary relatives of \"Cicer arietinum\" grow during the Winter and are harvested in the Spring. In the Near East, more than 80 percent of annual precipitation occurs between the months of December and February, while the long summers are hot and dry. Growing in the damp Winter months made the crops vulnerable to Ascochyta blight caused by \"Didymella rabiei\", resulting in crop failures. Recorded evidence shows that by the Hellenistic period and the time of the Roman Empire, summer cropping of chickpeas was being practiced.\nGenome sequencing.\nSequencing of the genome has been completed for 90 chickpea genotypes, including several wild species. A collaboration of 20 research organizations, led by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), sequenced CDC Frontier, a \"kabuli\" chickpea variety, and identified more than 28,000 genes and several million genetic markers.\nDescription.\nThe plant grows to 20\u201350\u00a0cm (8\u201320\u00a0in) high and has small, feathery leaves on either side of the stem. It has white flowers with blue, violet, or pink veins. Chickpeas are a type of pulse, with one seedpod containing two or three peas.\nVarieties.\n\"Desi\" is the most common variety of chickpea in South Asia, Ethiopia, Mexico, and Iran, typically grown in semi-arid tropics, also called Bengal gram. It has small, dark seeds and a rough coat; coloring can be black, green, or speckled. In Hindi, it is called \"desi chana\" 'native chickpea', or \"kala chana\" 'black chickpea', and in Assamese and Bengali, it is called \"boot\" or \"chholaa boot\". It can be hulled and split to make \"chana dal\", \"Kurukshetra Prasadam\" (channa laddu), and \"bootor daali\".\n\"Kabuli\" is the most common variety of chickpea in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East, typically grown in temperate regions. It is larger than Desi varieties and tan-colored, with a smooth coat. It was introduced to India in the 18th century from Afghanistan and is called \"kabuli chana\" in Hindi\".\"\n\"Ceci neri\", an uncommon black chickpea is grown only in Apulia and Basilicata, in southern Italy. It is around the same size as garbanzo beans, slightly larger and darker than the 'desi' variety.\nUses.\nCulinary.\nChickpeas are usually rapidly boiled for 10 minutes and then simmered for longer. Dried chickpeas need a long cooking time (1\u20132 hours), but will easily fall apart when cooked longer. If soaked for 12\u201324 hours before use, cooking time can be shortened by around 30 minutes. Chickpeas can also be pressure-cooked or \"sous vide\" cooked at .\nMature chickpeas can be cooked and eaten cold in salads, cooked in stews, ground into flour, ground and shaped in balls and fried as \"falafel\", made into a batter and baked to make \"farinata\" or \"socca\", or fried to make \"panelle\". Chickpea flour is known as \"gram flour\" or \"besan\" in South Asia and is used frequently in South Asian cuisine.\nIn Portugal, chickpeas are one of the main ingredients in \"rancho\", eaten with pasta, meat, or rice. They are used in other hot dishes with \"bacalhau\" and in soups, meat stews, salads mixed with tuna and vegetables, olive oil, vinegar, hot pepper, and salt. In Spain, they are used cold in \"tapas\" and salads, as well as in \"cocido madrile\u00f1o\".\nHummus is the Arabic word for chickpeas, which are often cooked and ground into a paste and mixed with tahini (sesame seed paste) to make \"\u1e25ummu\u1e63 bi \u1e6da\u1e25\u012bna\", usually called simply hummus in English. By the end of the 20th century, hummus had become common in American cuisine: by 2010, 5% of Americans consumed it regularly, and it was present at some point in 17% of American households.\nIn the Middle East, chickpeas are also roasted, spiced, and eaten as a snack, such as \"leblebi\".\nChickpeas and Bengal grams are used to make curries. They are one of the most popular vegetarian foods in the Indian subcontinent and in diaspora communities of many other countries, served with a variety of bread or steamed rice. Popular dishes in Indian cuisine are made with chickpea flour, such as \"mirchi bajji\" and \"mirapakaya bajji.\" In India, as well as in the Levant, unripe chickpeas are often picked out of the pod and eaten as a raw snack, and the leaves are eaten as a leaf vegetable in salads. In India, desserts such as besan halwa and sweets such as mysore pak, and laddu are made.\nChickpea flour is used to make \"Burmese tofu\", which was first known among the Shan people of Burma. In South Asian cuisine, chickpea flour (besan) is used as a batter to coat vegetables before deep frying to make pakoras. The flour is also used as a batter to coat vegetables and meats before frying or fried alone, such as \"panelle\" (little bread), a chickpea fritter from Sicily. Chickpea flour is used to make the Mediterranean flatbread \"socca\" and is called \"panisse\" in Provence, southern France. It is made of cooked chickpea flour, poured into saucers, allowed to set, cut into strips, and fried in olive oil, often eaten during Lent. In Tuscany, chickpea flour (farina di ceci) is used to make an oven-baked pancake: the flour is mixed with water, oil, and salt. Chickpea flour, known as kadlehittu in Kannada, is used for making sweet dish Mysore pak.\nIn the Philippines, chickpeas preserved in syrup are eaten as sweets and in desserts such as \"halo-halo\".\nAshkenazi Jews traditionally serve whole chickpeas, referred to as \"arbes\" (\u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05d1\u05e2\u05e1) in Yiddish, at the \"Shalom Zachar\" celebration for baby boys. The chickpeas are boiled until soft and served hot with salt and lots of ground black pepper.\n\"Guasanas\" or \"garbanza\" is a Mexican chickpea street snack. The beans, while still green, are cooked in water and salt, kept in a steamer to maintain their humidity, and served in a plastic bag.\nA chickpea-derived liquid (\"aquafaba\") can be used as an egg white replacement to make meringue or ice cream, with the residual pomace used as flour.\nIn 1793, ground, roasted chickpeas were noted by a German writer as a substitute for coffee in Europe. In the First World War, they were grown for this use in some areas of Germany. They are still sometimes brewed instead of coffee.\nAnimal feed.\nChickpeas are an energy and protein source as animal feed.\nRaw chickpeas have a lower trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitor content than peas, common beans, and soybeans. This leads to higher nutrition values and fewer digestive problems in nonruminants. Nonruminant diets can be completed with 200 g/kg of raw chickpeas to promote egg production and growth of birds and pigs. Higher amounts can be used when chickpeas are treated with heat.\nExperiments have shown that ruminants grow equally well and produce an equal amount and quality of milk when soybean or cereal meals are replaced with chickpeas. Pigs show the same performance, but growing pigs experience a negative effect of raw chickpea feed; extruded chickpeas can increase performance even in growing pigs. Only young broilers (starting period) showed worse performance in poultry diet experiments with untreated chickpeas. Fish performed equally well when extruded chickpeas replaced their soybean or cereal diet. Chickpea seeds have also been used in rabbit diets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary components of legumes\u2014such as lecithin, polyphenols, oligosaccharides; and amylase, protease, trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors\u2014can lead to lower nutrient availability, and thus to impaired growth and health of animals (especially in nonruminants). Ruminants generally have less trouble digesting legumes with secondary components since they can inactivate them in the rumen liquor. Their diets can be supplemented by 300\u00a0g/kg or more raw chickpea seeds. However, protein digestibility and energy availability can be improved through treatments such as germination, dehulling, and heat. Extrusion is a very good heat technique to destroy secondary legume components since the proteins are irreversibly denatured. Overprocessing may decrease the nutritional value; extrusion leads to losses in minerals and vitamins, while dry heating does not change the chemical composition.\nProduction.\nIn 2023, world production of chickpeas was 16.5 million tonnes, led by India with 75% of the total, and Australia as a major secondary producer (table).\nNutrition.\nCooked chickpeas are 60% water, 27% carbohydrates, 9% protein, and 3% fat (table). In a reference amount of , cooked chickpeas supply of food energy, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of folate (43% DV) and manganese (45% DV, table). Cooked chickpeas are a moderate source (10\u201316% DV) of thiamine and several dietary minerals (table).\nEffects of cooking.\nCooking treatments do not lead to variance in total protein and carbohydrate content. Soaking and cooking of dry seeds possibly induces chemical modification of protein-fibre complexes, which leads to an increase in crude fibre content. Thus, cooking can increase protein quality by inactivating or destroying heat-labile antinutritional factors. Cooking also increases protein digestibility, essential amino acid index, and protein efficiency ratio. Although cooking lowers concentrations of amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, total aromatic, and sulphur-containing amino acids, their contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference. Raffinose and sucrose and other reducing sugars diffuse from the chickpea into the cooking water and this reduces or completely removes these components from the chickpea. Cooking also significantly reduces fat and mineral content. The B vitamins riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and pyridoxine dissolve into cooking water at differing rates.\nGermination.\nGermination of chickpeas improves protein digestibility, although at a lower level than cooking. Germination degrades proteins to simple peptides, improving crude protein, nonprotein nitrogen, and crude fibre content. Germination decreases lysine, tryptophan, sulphur, and total aromatic amino acids, but most contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference pattern.\nOligosaccharides, such as stachyose and raffinose, are reduced in higher amounts during germination than during cooking. Minerals and B vitamins are retained more effectively during germination than with cooking. Phytic acids are reduced significantly, but trypsin inhibitor, tannin, and saponin reduction are less effective than cooking.\nAutoclaving, microwave cooking, boiling.\nIn a 2002 study comparing germination and cooking effects on chickpea nutritional values, all treatments of cooking (autoclaving, microwave cooking, and boiling) were found to improve protein digestibility. Essential amino acids were slightly increased by boiling and microwave cooking compared to autoclaving and germination. Losses of B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in those cooked by boiling and autoclaving.\nSkinning.\nChickpeas contain oligosaccharides (raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose) which are indigestible to humans but are fermented in the gut by bacteria, leading to flatulence in susceptible individuals. This can be prevented by skinning the husks from the chickpeas before serving.\nLeaves.\nIn some parts of the world, young chickpea leaves are consumed as cooked green vegetables. Especially in malnourished populations, it can supplement important dietary nutrients because regions where chickpeas are consumed have sometimes been found to have populations lacking micronutrients. Chickpea leaves have a significantly higher mineral content than either cabbage leaves or spinach leaves. Environmental factors and nutrient availability could influence mineral concentrations in natural settings. Consumption of chickpea leaves may contribute nutrients to the diet.\nResearch.\nThe consumption of chickpeas is under preliminary research for the potential to improve nutrition and affect chronic diseases.\nHeat and nutrient cultivation.\nAgricultural yield for chickpeas is often based on genetic and phenotypic variability, which has recently been influenced by artificial selection. The uptake of macronutrients such as inorganic phosphorus or nitrogen is vital to the plant development of \"Cicer arietinum\", commonly known as the perennial chickpea. Heat cultivation and macronutrient coupling are two relatively unknown methods used to increase the yield and size of the chickpea. Recent research has indicated that a combination of heat treatment along with the two vital macronutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen, is the most critical component to increasing the overall yield of \"Cicer arietinum\".\nPerennial chickpeas are a fundamental source of nutrition in animal feed as they are high-energy and protein sources for livestock. Unlike other food crops, the perennial chickpea can change its nutritional content in response to heat cultivation. Treating the chickpea with a constant heat source increases its protein content almost threefold. Consequently, the impact of heat cultivation affects the protein content of the chickpea itself and the ecosystem it supports. Increasing the height and size of chickpea plants involves using macronutrient fertilization with varying doses of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen.\nThe level of phosphorus that a chickpea seed is exposed to during its lifecycle has a positive correlation relative to the height of the plant at full maturity. Increasing the levels of inorganic phosphorus at all doses incrementally increases the height of the chickpea plant. Thus, the seasonal changes in phosphorus soil content, as well as periods of drought that are known to be a native characteristic of the dry Middle-Eastern region where the chickpea is most commonly cultivated, have a strong effect on the growth of the plant itself. Plant yield is also affected by a combination of phosphorus nutrition and water supply, resulting in a 12% increase in crop yield.\nNitrogen nutrition is another factor that affects the yield of \"Cicer arietinum\", although the application differs from other perennial crops regarding the levels administered to the plant. High doses of nitrogen inhibit the yield of the chickpea plant. Drought stress is a likely factor that inhibits nitrogen uptake and subsequent fixation in the roots of \"Cicer arietinum\". The perennial chickpea's growth depends on the balance between nitrogen fixation and assimilation, which is also characteristic of many other agricultural plant types. The influence of drought stress, sowing date, and mineral nitrogen supply affects the plant's yield and size, with trials showing that \"Cicer arietinum\" differed from other plant species in its capacity to assimilate mineral nitrogen supply from the soil during drought stress. Additional minerals and micronutrients make the absorption process of nitrogen and phosphorus more available. Inorganic phosphate ions are generally attracted towards charged minerals such as iron and aluminium oxides.\nAdditionally, growth and yield are also limited by the micronutrients zinc and boron deficiencies in the soil. Boron-rich soil increased chickpea yield and size, while soil fertilization with zinc seemed to have no apparent effect on the chickpea yield.\nPathogens.\nPathogens are the main cause of yield loss (up to 90%). One example is the fungus \"Fusarium oxysporum\" f.sp. \"ciceris\", present in most of the major pulse crop-growing areas and causing regular yield damages between 10 and 15%. Many plant hosts produce heat shock protein 70s including \"C. arietinum\". In response to \"F. o. ciceris\" Gupta \"et al.\", 2017 finds \"C. arietinum\" produces an orthologue of AtHSP70-1, an \"Arabidopsis\" HSP70.\nFrom 1978 until 1995, the worldwide number of pathogens increased from 49 to 172, of which 35 were recorded in India. These pathogens originate from groups of bacteria, fungi, viruses, mycoplasma, and nematodes and have high genotypic variation. The most widely distributed pathogens are \"Ascochyta rabiei\" (35 countries), \"Fusarium oxysporum\" f.sp. \"ciceris\" (32 countries) \"Uromyces ciceris-arietini\" (25 countries), bean leafroll virus (23 countries), and \"Macrophomina phaseolina\" (21 countries). \"Ascochyta\" disease emergence is favoured by wet weather; spores are carried to new plants by wind and water splash.\nThe stagnation of yield improvement over the last decades is linked to the susceptibility to pathogens. Research for yield improvement, such as an attempt to increase yield from by breeding cold-resistant varieties, is always linked with pathogen-resistance breeding as pathogens such as \"Ascochyta rabiei\" and \"F. o.\" f.sp. \"ciceris\" flourish in conditions such as cold temperature. Research started selecting favourable genes for pathogen resistance and other traits through marker-assisted selection. This method is a promising sign for the future to achieve significant yield improvements.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A fascist volunteer in his youth, he is chiefly known for his role in the Banco Ambrosiano scandal and in the Bologna massacre. He was revealed in 1981 as being the Venerable Master of the clandestine Masonic lodge Propaganda Due (P2). This would lead to him getting arrested in Switzerland in 1982. He managed to escape from prison the next year, but eventually agreed to surrender him back into the custody of Swiss authorities for a short period of time in 1987. From 1996 until his death in 2015, Galli remained mostly under house arrest at his home in Arezzo, Italy.\nEarly life.\nGelli was born in Pistoia, Tuscany. During the 1930s, Gelli, when he was still a seventeen-year-old student in a Liceo Classico high school in Pistoia, was expelled from all schools in Italy and left as a volunteer to fight in Spain with the Fascist Brigades that supported Generalissimo Franco. It was in the fighting of Malaga that his brother Raffaello died. The youngest recruit in his contingent, he was decorated by Franco himself.\nGelli also volunteered for the Blackshirts expeditionary forces sent by Mussolini in support of Francisco Franco's rebellion in the Spanish Civil War. He served as liaison officer between the Italian government and Nazi Germany, and participated in the Italian Social Republic with Giorgio Almirante, founder of the neofascist Italian Social Movement (MSI).\nAfter a sales job with the Italian mattress factory Permaflex, Gelli founded his own textile and importing company.\nInvolvement in failed coup and fugitive years in Argentina.\nIn 1970, in the plans of the failed \"Golpe Borghese\", Gelli was tasked with arresting the Italian President, Giuseppe Saragat. As Master of the Propaganda Due (P2) lodge, Gelli had ties with very high level personalities in Italy and abroad, in particular in Argentina, where he was a fugitive for many years. The regular Masonic lodge was enjoyed by Guillermo Su\u00e1rez Mason and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega, two key-exponents of the Argentine military junta.\nThe Argentine Chancellor Alberto Vignes drafted with Juan Per\u00f3n, who had returned from exile in 1973, a decree granting Gelli the \"Gran Cruz de la Orden del Libertador\" in August 1974, as well as the honorary office of economic counselor in the embassy of Argentina in Italy. Gelli publicly declared on repeated occasions that he was a close friend of Per\u00f3n, although no confirmation ever came from South America. Gelli affirmed that he introduced Peron to Masonry and that this friendship was of real importance for Italy. He stated: \"Peron was a Mason, I initiated him in Madrid in Puerta de Hierro, in June 1973.\" Gelli become the main economic and financial consultant of Isabel Per\u00f3n and of Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega.\nAccording to a letter sent by Gelli to C\u00e9sar de la Vega, a P2 member and Argentine ambassador to the UNESCO, Gelli commissioned P2 member Federico Carlos Barttfeld to be transferred from the consulate of Hamburg to the Argentine embassy in Rome. Gelli was also named minister plenipotentiary for cultural affairs in the Argentine embassy in Italy, thus providing him with diplomatic immunity. He had four diplomatic passports issued by Argentina, and has been charged in Argentina with falsification of official documents. During the 1970s, Gelli brokered three-way oil and arms deals between Libya, Italy and Argentina through the Agency for Economic Development, which he and Umberto Ortolani owned.\nSeveral members of the Argentine military junta have been found to be P2 members, such as Ra\u00fal Alberto Lastiri, Argentina's interim president from 13 July 1973 until 12 October 1973, Emilio Massera, part of Jorge Videla's military junta from 1976 to 1978, and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega, the infamous founder of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (\"Triple A\"). The lodge P2, also known as the Propaganda Due, was also linked to the robbery of Juan Per\u00f3n's severed hands.\nAlleged involvement in CIA activities in Italy.\nIn 1981 Gelli was one of the very few Italians to be invited to President Reagan's inauguration.\nIn 1990 a report on RAI Television alleged that the CIA had paid Gelli to instigate terrorist activities in Italy. Following this report, which also claimed that the CIA had been involved in the assassination of the Swedish Prime minister Olof Palme, then President Francesco Cossiga requested the opening of investigations while the CIA itself officially denied these allegations. Critics have claimed the RAI report to be a fraud because of the inclusion of testimony from Richard Brenneke, who claimed to be a former CIA agent and made several declarations concerning the October surprise conspiracy. Brenneke's background was also investigated by a U.S. Senate subcommittee, which dismissed Brenneke's claims of CIA employment. In June 2020, the Swedish police closed their investigation into Olof Palme's assassination, assigning blame to Stig Engstr\u00f6m, a Swedish graphic designer and centre-right municipal activist who was not affiliated with the CIA.\n1981 raid and the P2 list.\nGelli's downfall started with the Banco Ambrosiano scandal, which led to a 1981 police raid on his villa and the discovery of the P2 covert lodge. On 17 March 1981 a police raid on his villa in Arezzo led to the discovery of a list of 962 persons composed of Italian military officers and civil servants, including the heads of the three Italian secret services, involved in Propaganda Due (also known as \"P2\"), a clandestine lodge expelled from the Grande Oriente d'Italia Masonic organization. Future Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was on the list, although he had not yet entered politics. He was then known as the founder and owner of \"Canale 5\" TV channel, and was listed as a member of P2.\nA Parliamentary Commission, directed by Tina Anselmi (of the Christian Democratic party), found no evidence of crimes, but in 1981 the Italian parliament passed a law banning secret associations in Italy. Gelli was expelled from \"GOI\" freemasonry on 31 October 1981, and the P2 scandal provoked the fall of Arnaldo Forlani's cabinet in June 1981 \nThe P2 lodge had some form of power in Italy, given the public prominence of its members, and many observers still consider it to be extremely strong. Several famous people in Italy today (starting with the top TV anchor-man Maurizio Costanzo) were affiliated with P2. Among these Michele Sindona, a banker with clear connections to the Mafia, has been clearly associated with P2. In 1972, Sindona purchased a controlling interest in Long Island's Franklin National Bank. Two years later, the bank collapsed. Convicted in 1980 in the US, \"mysterious Michele\" was extradited to Italy. Two years later, he was poisoned in his cell while serving a life sentence. The P2 membership list was authenticated, with a few exceptions, by a 1984 parliamentary report.\nImprisonment in Switzerland, escape, and return to Switzerland.\nOn the run, Gelli escaped to Switzerland where he was arrested on 13 September 1982 while trying to withdraw tens of millions of dollars in Geneva. Detained in the modern Champ-Dollon Prison near Geneva, he managed to escape on August 10, 1983 and then fled to South America for four years. In 1984 Jorge Vargas, the secretary general of the \"Uni\u00f3n Nacionalista de Chile\" (UNACH, Nationalist Union of Chile, a short-lived National Socialist party ) and a former member of the \"Movimiento Revolucionario Nacional Sindicalista\" (National-Syndicalist Revolutionary Movement ), declared to \"La Tercera de la Hora\" that Gelli was then in Pinochet's Chile.\nFinally, in 1987, Gelli secretly came back to Switzerland in the car of his lawyer Marc Bonnant and surrendered in Geneva to investigative judge Jean-Pierre Trembley. He was wanted in connection with the 1982 collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano and on charges of subversive association in connection with the 1980 Bologna railway station bombing, which killed 85 people. He was sentenced to two months in prison in Switzerland, while an Italian court in Florence sentenced him on 15 December 1987, \"in absentia\", to eight years in prison on charges of financing right-wing terrorist activity in Tuscany in the 1970s. Gelli had already been sentenced \"in absentia\" to 14 months in jail by a court in San Remo for illegally exporting money from Italy.\nExtradition to Italy, trials and house arrest.\nSwitzerland eventually agreed to extradite him to Italy, but only on financial charges stemming from the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano. Gelli's extradition in February 1988 required a high-level security apparatus, including 100 sharpshooters, decoy cars, a train, road blocks and two armored cars to transfer him to Italy. In July 1988 he was absolved of charges of subversive association by a Bologna court but was presented with a five-year prison term for slander, having side-tracked the investigation into the 1980 bombing of the Bologna train station. Stipulations connected to his extradition, however, prevented him from serving time. Two years later, an appeal court threw out Gelli's slander conviction. A retrial was ordered in October 1993.\nIn 1992 Gelli was sentenced to 18 years and six months of prison after being found guilty of fraud concerning the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano in 1982 (a \"black hole\" of $1.4 billion was found). The Vatican bank, \"Istituto per le Opere di Religione\", main share-holder of the Banco Ambrosiano, consequently had a \"black hole\" of $250 million. This sentence was reduced by the Court of Appeal to 12 years. The year 1992 also saw the beginning of the trial of 16 members of the P2 Masonic Lodge, which included charges of conspiracy against the state, espionage, and the revelation of state secrets. In April 1994 Gelli received a 17-year sentence for divulging state secrets and slandering the investigation, while the court threw out the charge that P2 members conspired against the state; Gelli's sentence was reduced, and he was placed under house arrest two years later.\nIn April 1998 the Court of Cassation confirmed a 12-year sentence for the Ambrosiano crash. Gelli then disappeared on the eve of being imprisoned, in May 1998, while being under house arrest in his mansion near Arezzo. His disappearance was strongly suspected to be the result of being forewarned. Then, finally, he was arrested in September 1998 the French Riviera in Cannes. Two motions of no confidence were made by the right-wing opposition (the Northern League and the ex-Christian Democratic splinter groups CDU-CDR), against the Justice Minister, Giovanni Maria Flick, and the Interior Minister, Giorgio Napolitano, stating that Gelli had benefited from accomplices helping him in his escape. They also made reference to secret negotiations which would have allowed him to reappear without going to prison. But the two ministers won the confidence vote. Police found $2M worth of gold ingots in Gelli's villa.\nA few years after the Ambrosiano scandal, many suspects pointed toward Gelli with reference to his possible involvement in the murder of the Milanese banker Roberto Calvi, also known as \"God's banker\", who had been jailed in the wake of the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano. On 19 July 2005 Gelli was formally indicted by Roman Magistrates for the murder of Roberto Calvi, along with former Mafia boss Giuseppe Cal\u00f2 (also known as \"Pippo Cal\u00f2\"), businessmen Ernesto Diotallevi and Flavio Carboni, and the latter's girlfriend, Manuela Kleinszig. In his statement before the court Gelli blamed people connected with Calvi's work in financing the Polish Solidarity movement, allegedly on behalf of the Vatican. He was accused of having provoked Calvi's death in order to punish him for having embezzled money owed to him and the Mafia. The Mafia also wanted to prevent Calvi from revealing how the bank had been used for money laundering. Gelli's name, however, was not in the final indictment at the trial that started in October 2005, and the other accused were eventually acquitted due to \"insufficient evidence\", though by the time of these acquittals in June 2007, the prosecutor's office in Rome had opened a second investigation implicating Gelli, among others. In May 2009, the case against Gelli was dropped. According to the magistrate there was insufficient evidence to argue that Gelli had played a role in the planning and execution of the crime. Gelli has been implicated in Aldo Moro's murder, since the Italian chief of intelligence, accused of negligence, was a \"piduista\" (P2 member).\nAfter being captured in September 1998, Gelli would continue to remain under house arrest until his death in December 2015.\nLater years.\nIn 1996, Gelli was nominated as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, supported by Mother Teresa and Naguib Mahfouz. The same year, however, Gelli was placed under house arrest at his Villa Wanda home in Arezzo. Aside from a four month escape period, which occurred from May to September 1998, Gelli would continue to remain under house arrest at Villa Wanda for the remainder of the life. In 2003 Gelli told \"La Repubblica\" that it seemed that the P2 \"democratic rebirth plan\" was being implemented by Silvio Berlusconi:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every morning I speak to my conscience and the dialogue calms me down. I look at the country, read the newspaper, and think: \"All is becoming a reality little by little, piece by piece. To be truthful, I should have had the copyright to it. Justice, TV, public order. I wrote about this thirty years ago\u00a0... Berlusconi is an extraordinary man, a man of action. This is what Italy needs: not a man of words, but a man of action.\nHe talked of many Italian politicians. Of Fabrizio Cicchitto, he said he knew him well (\"\u00e8 bravo, preparato\"\u00a0\u2014 \"he's good and capable\"). With regard to Berlusconi's program for the reform of the judicial system, he boasted that this had been an integral part of his original project. He also approved of Berlusconi's reorganization of television networks.\nOn 15 December 2015 Gelli died in Arezzo, Tuscany, aged 96. The funeral home was set up in Villa Wanda. The funeral Mass was celebrated on December 17 in the Church of Mercy of Pistoia, his native town, in the presence of relatives and onlookers and relatively few VIPs. During the funeral, access to the church was prevented by a private security agency. The body was transferred to the family chapel of the Cemetery of Mercy in Pistoia, where his first wife Wanda already rested.\nAfter his death, an autographed will was published in which he named as his only \"spiritual heir\" the Romanian general Bartolomeu Constantin S\u0103voiu, Grand Master of the Romanian National Lodge.\nPersonal archive.\nOn 11 February 2006, Licio Gelli donated his \"non-secret archive\" to the State Archives of Pistoia, as part of an official ceremony, held under the patronage of the Municipality. However, the municipal administrators of Pistoia preferred not to take part in the ceremony.\nHowever, the so-called \"500 directory\" remained secret (426 files addressed by Gelli to businessmen, politicians, companies, banks, clergymen, etc.). Guardia di Finanza and investigators have never managed to find its contents.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Vaalserberg is located in the province of Limburg, at the south-easternmost edge of the country, near the town of Vaals (after which it is named).\nThe Vaalserberg was the highest point anywhere in the Netherlands until the Caribbean island of Saba, with its volcano, was incorporated into the country as a \"special municipality\" in 2010.\nThree-country point.\nThe Vaalserberg is also the location of the tripoint between Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands and so its summit is called the \"Drielandenpunt\" (\"three country point\") in Dutch, \"Dreil\u00e4ndereck\" (\"three country corner\") in German and \"Trois Fronti\u00e8res\" (\"three borders\") or \"Trois Bornes\" (\"three border stones\") in French.\nOn the Belgian side, the tripoint borders the region of Wallonia, including both the regular French-speaking area and the smaller German-speaking area. The German side falls within the city limits of Aachen in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Between 1830 and 1919, the summit was a quadripoint, also bordering Neutral Moresnet, which is now part of Belgium's German-speaking area.\nThe current Belgian-German border is not the same as the former eastern border of Moresnet with Prussia but is a little more to the east. Therefore, five different borders came together at this point but never more than four at one time, except possibly between 1917 and 1920, when the border situation was unclear and disputed.\nThe border intersection has made the Vaalserberg a well-known tourist attraction in the Netherlands, with a tower on the Belgian side (; ; ), opened in 1994 to replace the previous tower, built in 1970. It offers a grand panorama of the surrounding landscape.\n south of the point, a railway crosses the German-Belgian border in the \"Gemmenicher Tunnel\". It is the freight-only railway between Tongeren and Aachen.\nFour-borders road.\nThe road leading up to this point on the Dutch side is called the \"Viergrenzenweg\" (\"four borders way\"), probably because of the former territory of Neutral Moresnet. The names of the roads in Belgium (\"Route des Trois Bornes\") and Germany (\"Dreil\u00e4nderweg\") refer to the present three bordering countries.\nAlong the road on the Dutch side is the \"Wilhelminatoren\" observation tower, with a restaurant and forest trails. The present tower officially opened on 7 October 2011 and features a lift and a glass floor. The first tower at the site was built in 1905 during the reign of its namesake, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, and was demolished in 1945. The second tower opened on 11 August 1951 and was demolished over the winter of 2010\u20132011 because of its poor condition and high maintenance requirements.\nRoad cycling.\nThe Vaalserberg is often used in the Amstel Gold Race and is climbed halfway through the race. The climb is named in the roadbook of the Gold Race as Drielandenpunt and crosses the border with Belgium and followed after is the Gemmenich climb to go into the Netherlands again.\nThe Belgian climb part (or descent) is called C\u00f4te des Trois bornes or C\u00f4te des Trois Fronti\u00e8res and includes two hairpin bends. It starts from Gemmenich with the roadname Route des Trois Bornes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n'Tim Travel': https:// (YouTube)"}

It is the major waterway connecting the port of Rotterdam to Germany. Before it reaches Rotterdam, it joins with the Afgedamde Maas near Woudrichem to form the Boven Merwede. Along its length, Nijmegen, Tiel, Zaltbommel and Gorinchem are towns of importance with direct access to the river.\nThe river, which is the main channel in the Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta system, carries 65% of the total flow of the Rhine.\nHistory.\nThe name Waal, in Roman times called \"Vacalis, Vahalis\" or \"Valis\", later \"Vahal\", is of Germanic origin and is named after the many meanders in the river (). It is, in turn, thought to have inspired early Dutch settlers of the Hudson Valley region in New York to name the Wallkill River after it (\"Waalkil\" \"Waal Creek\").\nThe current river shows little signs of these great bends, since it has been the subject of numerous normalisation projects carried out between the 18th and 20th centuries to improve the river as an economically important shipping route. Some of the cut-off bends are still visible near the main river and are sometimes reconnected to it in times of high water levels.\nBend in South Holland.\nIn the Middle Ages, the name \"Waal\" continued after the confluence with the Meuse. The delta parts now known as Boven Merwede, Beneden Merwede and the upper section of the Noord were also called Waal. Near Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht, the mainstream continued west until it flowed into Oude Maas near Heerjansdam. This last stretch past Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht, which separated the river islands of IJsselmonde and Zwijndrechtse Waard, is still called Waal, but is more commonly known as Waaltje (Dutch for \"Little Waal\").

It is bordered by Overijssel to the south, Friesland to the west, Groningen to the north, and the German state of Lower Saxony to the east. As of January 2023, Drenthe had a population of about 502,000, and a total area of .\nDrenthe has been populated for 15,000 years. The region has subsequently been part of the Episcopal principality of Utrecht, Habsburg Netherlands, Dutch Republic, Batavian Republic, Kingdom of Holland and Kingdom of the Netherlands. Drenthe has been an official province since 1796. The capital and seat of the provincial government is Assen. The King's Commissioner of Drenthe is Jetta Klijnsma. The Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB) is the largest party in the States-Provincial, followed by the Labour Party (PvdA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).\nDrenthe has the lowest population density in the European Netherlands. It is a predominantly rural area, unlike many other parts of the Netherlands; except for the small cities of Assen (pop. 67,963) and Emmen (pop. 58,130), the land in Drenthe is mainly used for agriculture and it has a notable amount of forests and nature.\nHistory.\nThe name Drenthe is said to stem from Germanic \"thrija hantja\" meaning \"three lands\".\nDrenthe has been populated by people since prehistory. Artifacts from the Wolstonian Stage (150,000 years ago) are among the oldest found in the Netherlands. In fact, it was one of the most densely populated areas of the Netherlands until the Bronze Age. The most tangible evidence of this are the dolmens (\"hunebedden\") built around 3500 BC. 53 of the 54 dolmens in the Netherlands can be found in Drenthe, concentrated in the northeast of the province. In 2006, the archaeological reserve of Strubben\u2013Kniphorstbos, located between Anloo and Schipborg, was created to preserve part of this heritage.\nMost of the Bronze Age objects found in the Netherlands have been found in Drenthe. One item shows that trading networks during this period extended a far distance. Large bronze \"situlae\" (buckets) found in Drenthe were manufactured somewhere in eastern France or in Switzerland. They were used for mixing wine with water (a Roman/Greek custom). The many finds in Drenthe of rare and valuable objects, such as tin-bead necklaces, suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Netherlands in the Bronze Age.\nDrenthe was first mentioned in a document from 820, it was called \"Pago Treanth\" (Drenthe district). In archives from \"Het Utrechts Archief\", from 1024 to 1025, the \"county Drenthe\" is mentioned, when Emperor Henry II gave it to Bishop Adalbold II of Utrecht. Subjugation of this region into the Holy Roman Empire culminated in the Drenther Crusade launched by the Papacy around 1228-1232.\nAfter long being subject to the Utrecht diocese, Bishop Henry of Wittelsbach in 1528 ceded Drenthe to Emperor Charles V of Habsburg, who incorporated it into the Habsburg Netherlands. When the Republic of the Seven United Provinces was declared in 1581, Drenthe became part of it as the County of Drenthe, although it never gained full provincial status due to its poverty; the province was so poor it was exempt from paying federal taxes and as a consequence was denied representation in the States General. The successor Batavian Republic granted it provincial status on 1 January 1796.\nShortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, the Dutch government built a camp near the town of Hooghalen to intern German Jewish refugees. During the Second World War, the German occupiers used the camp (which they named KZ Westerbork) as a \"Durchgangslager\" (transit camp). Many Dutch Jews, Sinti, Roma, resistance combatants and political adversaries were imprisoned before being transferred to concentration and extermination camps in Germany and occupied Poland. Anne Frank was deported on the last train leaving the Westerbork transit camp on 3 September 1944.\nIn the 1970s, there were four hostage crises where South Moluccan terrorists demanded an independent Republic of South Maluku. They held hostages in hijacked trains in 1975 and 1977, in a primary school in 1977, and in the province hall in 1978.\nGeography.\nDrenthe is situated at in the northeast of the Netherlands; with to the north the province Groningen, to the west the province Friesland, to the south the province Overijssel, and to the east the German districts Emsland and Bentheim in the state Lower Saxony.\nDrenthe is the 9th largest province of the Netherlands. It has a total area of , with of land and of water. About 72% of the land or is used for agriculture.\nDrenthe has several heathlands and no significant rivers or lakes. The national parks Drents-Friese Wold and Dwingelderveld (IUCN category II) and the national landscape Drentsche Aa (IUCN category V) are all (partially) located in the province.\nThe major urban centers of the province are the capital Assen in the north and Emmen, Meppel, Hoogeveen, and Coevorden in the south.\nClimate.\nDrenthe has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfb).\nSubdivisions.\nThe province (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics or NUTS level 2) is divided into three COROP regions (NUTS level 3): North Drenthe, Southeast Drenthe, and Southwest Drenthe. The COROP regions are used for statistical purposes.\nThe Netherlands underwent a large number of municipal mergers in the past decades and Drenthe was no exception. The most significant simultaneous set of mergers took place in 1998, when 32 municipalities were amalgamated into 10 larger municipalities. As of 2014[ [update]] Drenthe consists of 12 municipalities; Emmen is the largest municipality in terms of both population and area, Westerveld is the least populous and Meppel covers the smallest area.\nThe municipalities Assen, Noordenveld, and Tynaarlo are part of the interprovincial Groningen-Assen Region and the municipalities Aa en Hunze, Assen, Borger-Odoorn, Coevorden, Emmen, Midden-Drenthe, Noordenveld, and Westerveld are part of the international Ems Dollart Region (EDR).\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOn 1 January 2023, Drenthe had a total population of 502,051 and a population density of .

The province borders Drenthe to the north, Friesland to the north-west, Flevoland (and a small part of the IJsselmeer) to the west, Gelderland to the south and west, and Germany's states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia to the east. Overijssel had a population of about 1,184,000 as of January 2023. \nThe province's name comes from the perspective of the Episcopal principality of Utrecht, which held the territory until 1528. The capital city of Overijssel is Zwolle (pop. 132,441) and the largest city is Enschede (pop. 161,235). The land mostly consists of grasslands and some forests (including Sallandse Heuvelrug National Park).\nHistory.\nOversticht.\nOverijssel was formerly known as Oversticht and also included most of the modern-day province of Drenthe. In 1336, it was made part of Guelders, though it was ceded to the Bishopric of Utrecht in 1347. The Bishops ceded the Oversticht to the Emperor Charles V in 1528, who styled himself Lord of Overijssel, after the Latin name of Oversticht that was known since 1233: \"Transysla\" or \"Transisalania\", or Over-IJssel, i.e. the other side of the river IJssel. The people joined with the other Dutch and rebelled against Charles' heir Philip II. Overijssel became governed by the most powerful mayors and lords in the province, including by the lieutenant-governor Nicolaas Schmelzing (1561\u20131629).\nAfter a brief occupation by the forces of the Bishop of M\u00fcnster (1672\u201374), Overijssel received a new form of government which granted the stadtholders more power. Widespread resistance against the increased power throughout the provinces eventually led to the formation of the Batavian Republic in 1795. A centralist government arose and the Netherlands was organised into a series of \"d\u00e9partements\", based on those used by revolutionary France.\nOverijssel.\nAt first organised into its own \"d\u00e9partement\", it was merged with Drenthe in 1798 to form Ouden IJssel, which was renamed Overijssel in 1801.\nThe French annexed the Batavian Republic in 1810, and Overijssel was organised into the new French d\u00e9partement of Bouches-de-l'Yssel. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, the kingdom of the Netherlands and the former province of Overijssel were recreated.\nOverijssel was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II from May 1940 until its liberation in April 1945. The Noordoostpolder, a reclaimed territory which had been laid dry in 1942, was part of Overijssel from 1962 until 1986, when it became part of the newly created province of Flevoland.\nGeography.\nOverijssel is bordered by Germany (Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia) to the east, the Achterhoek region of Gelderland to the south, the Veluwe region of Gelderland and Flevoland to the west, and Friesland and the former moors of Drenthe to the north. Overijssel comprises three regions: Kop van Overijssel in the northwest, Salland in the centre of the province, and Twente in the east. Besides the capital Zwolle, other major cities are Almelo, Deventer, Hengelo, Enschede, and Kampen.\nTo the southeast, the province's surface is mostly sandy, interspersed with small rivers such as the Regge and Dinkel and other brooks. In the northwest, the geology is dominated by sediments from the \"Overijsselse Vecht\" and clay. The northern parts were once covered by \"veen\" (bogs) which separated the dryer and more arable south from Drenthe and which have been exploited as fuel to a large degree. Only small patches survive today (\"Engbertsdijksvenen\" near Geesteren, \"Witteveen\" (near Haaksbergen), and the Aamsveen (near Enschede). The extreme northwest is dominated by a system of lakes formed by former peat-mining and protected under the Weerribben-Wieden National Park status, which is a valuable wetland.\nThe highest point in Overijssel is the summit of the Tankenberg, a hill in the municipality of Losser, at 85 metres (278\u00a0ft). The lowest point is in the Mastenbroek Polder near Kampen at 2 metres (6\u00a0ft) below sea level.\nImportant rivers : IJssel, Zwarte Water, Overijsselse Vecht, Dinkel, Regge and Reest.\nMajor channels : Twentekanaal (Enschede and Zutphen-branch to Almelo), Overijssels Kanaal, Kanaal Almelo-De Haandrik, Kanaal Almelo-Nordhorn (outdoors) and Dedemsvaart (largely muted).\nClimate.\nOverijssel enjoys an oceanic climate (Cfb in the K\u00f6ppen classification). However, winters tend to be more severe than the rest of the Netherlands, because of its distance from the coast.\nPolitics.\nThe King's Commissioner of Overijssel is Andries Heidema (CU) since 11 July 2018. The King's Commissioner is the chairman of the Provincial-Executive (executive branch) and the States-Provincial (elected legislature) of the province.\nThe Provincial Council, the general government of the province, consists of 47 members who are elected every four years. Until the States elections of March 2007, Overijssel had 63 Members of Parliament. An amendment to the Provinces Act resulted in the total number of States members in the Netherlands being reduced from 764 to the current 564.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2015, 26.1% of the population were Protestant, while 23.3% were Roman Catholic, 2.9% were Muslim, and 5.6% adhered to other faiths. Over two-fifths of the population (42.2%) identified as non-religious. In 2010-2013 Overijssel had the highest rate of people as a provincial proportion in the Netherlands who regularly visit a place of worship (although not the highest rate of religious affiliation which was in Limburg). The province has many orthodox Calvinist communities (most strongly in Staphorst) adhering to the Dutch Reformed Church (\"Hervormde\") or Reformed (\"Gereformeerde\"), mainly in the western part that forms part of the Bible Belt. Overijssel also has regular Protestant Church communities and also has some of the highest concentration of Catholic adherents outside the south of the Netherlands in several municipalities in the east and south of the province.\nEconomy.\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 43.2 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 5.6% of the Netherlands economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 32,700 \u20ac or 108% of the EU27 average in the same year.\nThe province has become highly industrialized. The Twente district in the southeast, where cotton spinning, weaving, and bleaching came into prominence in the 19th century, is one of the principal centres of the Dutch textile industry. The main centres are Enschede, Almelo, Hengelo, and Oldenzaal. Other important industrial centres are Deventer, Kampen, and Zwolle.\nTransport.\nCycling.\nBicycling is common and integrated into Overijssel's everyday transportation network.\nRoad.\nOverijssel is an important transit province to and from Germany and the northeast of the Netherlands. There are three main motorways in Overijssel, the A1, A28, and the A35/N35. Other major trunk roads are the N18, A32, N36, N48 and N50. In addition, the province manages a large number of provincial roads of major and minor importance.\nRail network.\nFour intercity connections (Enschede-Randstad, Zwolle \u2013 Roosendaal and Groningen/Leeuwarden-Amersfoort-Randstad and Groningen/Leeuwarden-Lelystad-Randstad) run through Overijssel. Zwolle railway station has a junction function. The stations of Almelo, Deventer and Hengelo have a transfer function. The stations of Hengelo, Enschede and Oldenzaal have a direct connection with Germany. The international intercity to Berlin stops in Deventer, Almelo and Hengelo. Goods traffic takes place on many lines to Germany and the north of the Netherlands.\nThe following railway lines are located in Overijssel:\nAirport.\nThe main airport in Overijssel is the Enschede Airport Twente, located outside of Enschede. The airport does not currently offer any international flights, though it has historically.\nWaterways.\nDue to its location on the IJssel, Overijssel has a number of large bridges. The most important is the IJsselbrug near Zwolle, but the IJsselbrug near Deventer is also important. These are also the busiest roads in the province. At Kampen the N50 crosses the IJssel. Kampen also has two bridges over the IJssel. Other bridges over the IJssel are at Zwolle the Oude IJsselbrug and the railway bridge over the IJssel, and at Deventer a railway and road bridge. In addition to these bridges, the river IJssel can also be crossed at a number of places by means of a number of ferries.\nMunicipalities.\nOverijssel is divided into 25 municipalities. Until 1 January 2001, there were still 44, but after a municipal reclassification came into effect, the number fell to 26. On 1 January 2005, the municipalities of Deventer and Bathmen were merged (under the name Deventer), reducing the number of municipalities into 25.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a total area of of which is water, it is the largest province of the Netherlands by land area, and second by total area. Gelderland shares borders with six other provinces (Flevoland, Limburg, North Brabant, Overijssel, South Holland and Utrecht) and the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\nThe capital is Arnhem (pop. 159,265); however, Nijmegen (pop. 176,731) and Apeldoorn (pop. 162,445) are both larger municipalities. Other major regional centres in Gelderland are Ede, Doetinchem, Zutphen, Harderwijk, Tiel, Wageningen, Zevenaar, and Winterswijk. Gelderland had a population of about 2,134,000 as of January 2023. It contains the Netherlands's largest forest region (the Veluwe), the Rhine and other major rivers, and a significant amount of orchards in the south (Betuwe).\nHistory.\nHistorically, the province dates from states of the Holy Roman Empire and takes its name from the nearby German city of Geldern. According to the Wichard saga, the Lords of Pont fought and killed a dragon in 878 AD, and named the town they founded after the death-rattle of the dragon: \"Gelre!\"\nThe County of Guelders arose out of the Frankish pagus Hamaland in the 11th century around castles near Roermond and Geldern. The counts of Gelre acquired the Betuwe and Veluwe regions and, through marriage, the County of Zutphen. Thus the counts of Guelders laid the foundation for a territorial power that, through control of the Rhine, Waal, Meuse and IJssel rivers, was to play an important role in the later Middle Ages. The geographical position of their territory dictated the external policy of the counts during the following centuries; they were committed to the interests of the Holy Roman Empire and to expansion south and west.\nFurther enlarged by the acquisition of the imperial city of Nijmegen in the 13th century, the countship was raised to a duchy in 1339 by the Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV. After 1379, the duchy was ruled from J\u00fclich and by the counts of Egmond and Cleves. The duchy resisted Burgundian domination, but William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg was forced to cede it to Charles V in 1543, after which it formed part of the Burgundian-Habsburg hereditary lands.\nThe duchy revolted with the rest of the Netherlands against Philip II of Spain and joined the Union of Utrecht (1579). After the deposition of Philip II, its sovereignty was vested in the States of Gelderland, and the princes of Orange were stadtholders. In 1672, the province was temporarily occupied by Louis XIV and, in 1713, the southeastern part, including the ducal capital of Geldern, fell to Prussia. Part of the Batavian Republic (1795\u20131806), of Louis Bonaparte's Kingdom of Holland (1806\u201310), and of the French Empire (1810\u201313), Gelderland became a province of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815.\nDuring the Second World War, the area saw heavy fighting between Allied Paratroopers, British XXX Corps and the German II SS Panzer Corps, at the Battle of Arnhem.\nGeography.\nGelderland can roughly be divided into four geographical regions: the Veluwe in the north, the Rivierenland including the Betuwe in the southwest, the Achterhoek (literally meaning the \"back corner\") or Graafschap (which originally means earldom or county) in the east and the city-region of Arnhem and Nijmegen in the centre-south.\nMunicipalities.\nIn 2020, the 51 municipalities in Gelderland were divided into four COROPs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAbolished municipalities.\nThese municipalities were merged with neighbouring ones:\nThese municipalities were merged and given a new name:\nTransport.\nGelderland has over 5,000 kilometers of cycle paths.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was \u20ac78.3 billion in 2018, accounting for 10.1% of the Netherlands' economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac33,000 or 110% of the EU27 average in the same year.\nCulture.\nIn Gelderland there are many museums, like the Netherlands Open Air Museum and Museum Arnhem in Arnhem, Valkhof Museum in Nijmegen, the Het Loo Palace in Apeldoorn and in Otterlo the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum. There are several large theatres in Gelderland such as the Stadsschouwburg in Nijmegen, Stadstheater in Arnhem and Orpheus (theater) in Apeldoorn. Some cities are also equipped with large concert halls like MUSIS (formerly: Musis sacrum) in Arnhem and Concertgebouw de Vereeniging in Nijmegen. The more widely-known popular music venues are Luxor Live in Arnhem, Doornroosje in Nijmegen, Gigant in Apeldoorn and the GelreDome stadium in Arnhem. Every year the municipality Renkum and Overbetuwe receive a large amount of tourist visiting because of the Battle of Arnhem.

{"id": "57161", "revid": "50368418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57161", "title": "North Holland", "text": "Province of the Netherlands\nNorth Holland (, ) is a province of the Netherlands in the northwestern part of the country. It is located on the North Sea, north of South Holland and Utrecht, and west of Friesland and Flevoland. As of January 2023, it had a population of about 2,952,000 and a total area of , of which is water.\nFrom the 9th to the 16th century, the area was an integral part of the County of Holland. During this period West Friesland was incorporated. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the area was part of the province of Holland and commonly known as the Noorderkwartier (English: \"Northern Quarter\"). In 1840, the province of Holland was split into the two provinces of North Holland and South Holland. In 1855, the Haarlemmermeer was drained and turned into land.\nThe provincial capital is Haarlem (pop. 161,265). The province's largest city and also the largest city in the Netherlands is the Dutch capital Amsterdam, with a population of 862,965 as of November 2019. The King's Commissioner of North Holland is Arthur van Dijk, who has been serving since 2019. There are 45 municipalities and three (including parts of) water boards in the province. The busiest airport in the Netherlands and Europe's third-busiest airport, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, is in North Holland.\nHistory.\nEmergence of a new province (1795 to 1840).\nThe province of North Holland as it is today has its origins in the period of French rule from 1795 to 1813. This was a time of bewildering changes to the Dutch system of provinces. In 1795, the old order was swept away and the Batavian Republic was established. In the Constitution enacted on 23 April 1798, the old borders were radically changed. The republic was reorganised into eight departments (\"d\u00e9partement\") with roughly equal populations. Holland was split up into five departments named \"Texel\", \"Amstel\", \"Delf\", \"Schelde en Maas\", and \"Rijn\". The first three of these lay within the borders of the old Holland; the latter two were made up of parts of different provinces. In 1801 the old borders were restored when the department of Holland was created. This reorganisation had been short-lived, but it gave birth to the concept of breaking up Holland and making it a less powerful province.\nIn 1807, Holland was reorganised. This time the two departments were called \"Amstelland\" (corresponding to the modern province of North Holland) and \"Maasland\" (corresponding to the modern province of South Holland). This also did not last long. In 1810, all the Dutch provinces were integrated into the French Empire. Amstelland and Utrecht were amalgamated as the department of \"Zuiderzee\" (Zuyderz\u00e9e in French) and Maasland was renamed \"Monden van de Maas\" (Bouches-de-la-Meuse in French).\nAfter the defeat of the French in 1813, this organisation remained unchanged for a year or so. When the 1814 Constitution was introduced, the country was reorganised as provinces and regions (\"landschappen\"). Zuiderzee and Monden van de Maas were reunited as the province of \"Holland\". One of the ministers on the constitutional committee (van Maanen) suggested that the old name \"Holland and West Friesland\" be reintroduced to respect the feelings of the people of that region. This proposal was rejected.\nHowever, the division was not totally reversed. When the province of Holland was re-established in 1814, it was given two governors, one for the former department of Amstelland (area that is now North Holland) and one for the former department of Maasland (now South Holland). Even though the province had been reunited, the two areas were still being treated differently in some ways and the idea of dividing Holland remained alive. During this reorganisation the islands of Vlieland and Terschelling were returned to Holland and parts of \"Hollands Brabant\" (including \"Land of Altena\") went to North Brabant. The borders with Utrecht and Gelderland were definitively set in 1820.\nWhen the constitutional amendments were introduced in 1840, it was decided to split Holland once again, this time into two provinces called \"North Holland\" and \"South Holland\". The need for this was not felt in South Holland or in West Friesland (which feared the dominance of Amsterdam). The impetus came largely from Amsterdam, which still resented the 1838 relocation of the court of appeal to The Hague in South Holland.\nUrbanisation and economic growth (1840 to today).\nAfter the Haarlemmermeer was drained in 1855 and turned into arable land, it was made part of North Holland. In exchange, South Holland received the greater part of the municipality of Leimuiden in 1864. In 1942, the islands Vlieland and Terschelling went back to the province of Friesland. In 1950, the former island Urk was ceded to the province of Overijssel.\nIn February 2011, North Holland, together with the provinces of Utrecht and Flevoland, showed a desire to investigate the feasibility of a merger between the three provinces. This has been positively received by the First Rutte cabinet, for the desire to create one Randstad province has already been mentioned in the coalition agreement. The province of South Holland, part of the Randstad urban area, visioned to be part of the Randstad province, and very much supportive of the idea of a merger into one province. With or without South Holland, if created, the new province would be the largest in the Netherlands in both area and population.\nGeography.\nNorth Holland is situated at in the northwest of the Netherlands with to the northeast the province of Friesland, to the east the province of Flevoland, to the southeast the province of Utrecht, to the southwest the province of South Holland, and to the west the North Sea.\nNorth Holland is a broad peninsula for the most part, located between the North Sea, the Wadden Sea, the IJsselmeer, and the Markermeer. More than half of the province consists of reclaimed polder land situated below sea level. The West Frisian islands of Noorderhaaks and Texel are also part of the province. North Holland makes up a single region of the International Organization for Standardization world region code system, having the code -NH.\nNature.\nSome of the best known nature reserves in this province are:\nMore information about nature reserves in North Holland is available (in Dutch) on the relevant site pages of national nature conservation organisations Natuurmonumenten and Staatsbosbeheer\n, as well as provincial organisation \"Landschap Noord-Holland\".\nRegions in North Holland.\nNorth Holland has various regions that, for historical or other reasons, have their own identities. Some of these regions are unofficial, ill-defined and sometimes overlapping. Others are official and are part of regional groupings artificially created for various administrative purposes. These regions are not the same as the municipalities.\nList of some of these unofficial and official regions in North Holland:\nPopulation and municipalities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAbout one in six Dutch people live in North Holland, which resulted in a population density over eight times the European average as of 2004. \nAs of 24 March 2022, North Holland is divided into 45 municipalities (local government). After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, three islands in the Caribbean: Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius, were offered to join the province. However, the offer has been neither accepted nor rejected. \nNorth Holland has five municipalities with 100,000 or more inhabitants. They are, in order of size, Amsterdam (in terms of population this is also the largest municipality in the Netherlands), Haarlem, Zaanstad, Haarlemmermeer and Alkmaar. Another seven municipalities have a population between 50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants (Hilversum, Amstelveen, Purmerend, Hoorn, Velsen, Den Helder and Dijk en Waard).\nMunicipalities are grouped for statistical purposes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReligion.\nIn 2015 official statistics have showed that most inhabitants are religiously unaffiliated. 62.9% are not religious, 16.3% are Roman Catholic, 7.9% are Protestant, 6.6% are Muslim, and 6.2% of other faiths. Almost half of all Dutch Jews live in this province, mainly in and around Amsterdam and Amstelveen which has the highest Jewish population in the Netherlands. Dutch Muslims in North Holland are also concentrated in Amsterdam and some surroundings like Zaanstad. Although Catholicism in the Netherlands in mainly concentrated in the south of the country, there exist several highly Catholic exclaves within North Holland especially in the north of the province such as in Edam-Volendam and Opmeer where more than half are adherents. North Holland has the lowest rate of Protestantism and orthodox Calvinism outside the south of the country, however it does have one strongly Protestant village called Marken.\nEconomy.\nSeveral international organisations such as Amnesty International have settled the head office of their Netherlands branch in the province and particularly in Amsterdam; the international head office of Greenpeace is located in the city. Other companies based in the Netherlands' capital include Akzo Nobel, Heineken International, ING Group, ABN AMRO, TomTom, Delta Lloyd Group, Booking.com and Philips. Randstad NV is headquartered in Diemen while KPMG and KLM operate from Amstelveen.\nSeveral national nature friendly organisations like Milieudefensie, the national \"Union of vegetarians\", the \"Vissenbescherming\" (Fish protection foundation) and the Party for the Animals as well have their head office in North Holland.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57164", "revid": "37133225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57164", "title": "Cajuns", "text": "Louisiana French ethnicity\nThe Cajuns (; French: \"les Cadjins\" or \"les Cadiens\" ), also known as Louisiana \"Acadians\" (French: \"les Acadiens\"), are a Louisiana French ethnicity mainly found in the US state of Louisiana and surrounding Gulf Coast states.\nWhile Cajuns are usually described as the descendants of the Acadian exiles who went to Louisiana over the course of \"Le Grand D\u00e9rangement\", Louisianians frequently use \"Cajun\" as a broad cultural term (particularly when referencing Acadiana) without necessitating race or descent from the deported Acadians. Although the terms \"Cajun\" and \"Creole\" today are often portrayed as separate identities, Louisianians of Acadian descent have historically been known as, and are, a subset of Creoles (synonymous for \"Louisianais\", which is a demonym for French Louisianians). Cajuns make up a significant portion of south Louisiana's population and have had an enormous impact on the state's culture.\nWhile Lower Louisiana had been settled by French colonists since the late 17th century, many Cajuns trace their roots to the influx of Acadian settlers after the Great Expulsion from their homeland during the French and British hostilities prior to the French and Indian War (1756 to 1763). Most Acadians can trace their ancestry back to approximately 50 families who were living in Port Royal, Acadia, now Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, in 1671. The Acadia region to which many modern Cajuns trace their origin consisted largely of what are now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island plus parts of eastern Quebec and northern Maine.\nSince their establishment in Louisiana, the Cajuns have become famous for their French dialect, Louisiana French, and have developed a rich culture including folkways, music, and cuisine. Acadiana is heavily associated with them.\nEtymology and historical usage of the term.\nThe term \"Cajun\" comes from a rural pronunciation of \"Acadien\" (Acadian).\nCivil War usage.\nThe first usage of the term \"Cajun\" came about during the American Civil War, during the Union's invasion of French Louisiana.\nAfter conquering Vermilionville, the capital of \"Nouvelle Acadie\" (New Acadia) in 1863, Lieutenant George C. Harding of the 21st Indiana Infantry used the term \"Cajun\" to describe the region's inhabitants:\nI will try and tell what a Cajun is. He is a half-savage creature, of mixed French and Indian blood, lives in swamps and subsists by cultivating small patches of corn and sweet potatoes. The wants of the Cajun are few, and his habits are simple... I can not say that we were abused by the Cajuns.\nA correspondent for the New York Herald reported: \"Our forces captured some prisoners. Many deserters and refugees came within our lines. The rebel deserters are principally French Creoles, or Arcadians...\"\nIn 1863, war correspondent Theophilus Noel reported for his newspaper: \"You must not use the word Cagin, implying thereby that there is any nigger blood in the party to whom you are talking.\"\nCajun Country/Creole City usage.\nAfter the Civil War, urban Creoles began referring to the peasant class (\"petits habitants\") as \"Cajuns\". Cajuns inhabited the \"Cajun Countries\" of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\nAt the same time, \"Creole\" increasingly referred to Creoles of the middle class (\"bourgeoisie\") or aristocratic class (\"grands habitants\"), and served as a designation for inhabitants of the \"Creole Cities\": Mobile, Alabama and New Orleans, Louisiana.\nCarl Brasseaux notes in \"Acadian to Cajun, Transformation of a People\", that:\n\"Cajun\" was used by Anglos to refer to all persons of French descent and low economic standing, regardless of their ethnic affiliation. Hence poor Creoles of the bayou and prairie regions came to be permanently identified as \"Cajun\". The term \"Cajun\" thus became a socioeconomic classification for the multicultural amalgam of several culturally and linguistically distinct groups.\nAlabama Cajans.\nCajans inhabited a region of Alabama called the Cajan Country, which was all of the bayou country surrounding Mobile. To the north, the Cajan Country reached the hills of Mount Vernon and Citronelle, and to the east, it reached through the bayous and forests around Daphne to the Perdido River.\nCajans were of varying racial mixtures; during the segregation era, some Cajans under Alabama's new racial laws were considered black, others were considered white, and others yet designated as Indians. Cajans were discriminated against due to their racial ambiguity, and many did not have access to public schools. Cajans tended to stay among their own communities.\nAmericanized usage.\nAfter the Americanization of Acadiana between the 1950s and 1970s, the term \"Cajun\" became synonymous with \"white French Louisianian\", due in part to CODOFIL's decision to promote Louisiana's link to Acadia in the \"Cajun Renaissance\".\nIt is common to see various demographic differences assigned to the Cajun/Creole binary. A typical example is cuisine: Many claim that \"Cajun\" gumbo does not include tomatoes whereas \"Creole\" gumbo does, but this distinction is better viewed as geographic rather than ethnic. Residents of Acadiana\u2014a historically isolated and rural region\u2014do not typically make gumbo with tomatoes, regardless of ancestry or self-proclaimed identity, whereas urban New Orleanians do. Technically, \"Cajun\" cuisine should properly fit under the umbrella of \"Creole\" cuisine, much like \"Cajuns\" themselves traditionally fit under the \"Creole\" umbrella.\nIn contrast to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, today's Cajuns and Creoles are often presented as distinct groups, and some Cajuns disavow a Creole identity whereas others embrace it. Surnames and geographic location are not necessarily markers of either identity.\nCajun nationality.\nEthnic group of national origin.\nThe Cajuns retain a unique dialect of the French language called Louisiana French (or more commonly known as Cajun French), and hold numerous other cultural traits that distinguish them as an ethnic group. Cajuns were officially recognized by the US government as a national ethnic group in 1980 per a discrimination lawsuit filed in federal district court. Presided over by Judge Edwin Hunter, the case, known as \"Roach v. Dresser Industries Valve and Instrument Division\" (494 F.Supp. 215, D.C. La., 1980), hinged on the issue of the Cajuns' ethnicity:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We conclude that plaintiff is protected by Title VII's ban on national origin discrimination. The Louisiana Acadian is alive and well. He is \"up front\" and \"main stream.\" He is not asking for any special treatment. By affording coverage under the \"national origin\" clause of Title VII he is afforded no special privilege. He is given only the same protection as those with English, Spanish, French, Iranian, Czechoslovakian, Portuguese, Polish, Mexican, Italian, Irish, et al., ancestors.\u2014\u200a\nHistory of Acadian ancestors.\nThe British conquest of Acadia happened in 1710. Over the next 45 years, the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to the Crown. During this period, Acadians participated in various military operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour. During the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years' War and known by that name in Canada and Europe), the British sought to neutralize the Acadian military threat and to interrupt their vital supply lines to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia. The territory of Acadia was afterward divided and apportioned to various British colonies, now Canadian provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, the Gaspe Peninsula in the province of Quebec. The deportation of the Acadians from these areas beginning in 1755 has become known as the Great Upheaval or \"Le Grand D\u00e9rangement\".\nThe Acadians' migration from Canada was spurred by the 1763 Treaty of Paris which ended the war. The treaty terms provided 18 months for unrestrained emigration. Many Acadians moved to the region of the Atakapa in present-day Louisiana, often travelling via the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). Joseph Broussard led the first group of 200 Acadians to arrive in Louisiana on February 27, 1765, aboard the \"Santo Domingo\". On April 8, 1765, he was appointed militia captain and commander of the \"Acadians of the Atakapas\" region in St. Martinville. Some of the settlers wrote to their family scattered around the Atlantic to encourage them to join them at New Orleans. For example, Jean-Baptiste Semer wrote to his father in France:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My dear father ... you can come here boldly with my dear mother and all the other Acadian families. They will always be better off than in France. There are neither duties nor taxes to pay and the more one works, the more one earns without doing harm to anyone.\u2014\u200a\nThe Acadians were scattered throughout the eastern seaboard. Families were split and boarded ships with different destinations. Many ended up west of the Mississippi River in what was then French-colonized Louisiana, including territory as far north as Dakota territory. France had ceded the colony to Spain in 1762, prior to their defeat by Britain and two years before the first Acadians began settling in Louisiana. The interim French officials provided land and supplies to the new settlers. The Spanish governor, Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez, later proved to be hospitable, permitting the Acadians to continue to speak their language, practice their native religion (Roman Catholicism \u2013 which was also the official religion of Spain), and otherwise pursue their livelihoods with minimal interference. Some families and individuals did travel north through the Louisiana territory to set up homes as far north as Wisconsin. Acadians fought in the American Revolution. Although they fought for Spanish General Galvez, their contribution to the winning of the war has been recognized.\nGalvez left New Orleans with an army of Spanish regulars and the Louisiana militia made up of 600 Acadian volunteers and captured the British strongholds of Fort Bute at Bayou Manchac, across from the Acadian settlement at St. Gabriel. On September 7, 1779, Galvez attacked Fort Bute and then on September 21, 1779, attacked and captured Baton Rouge.\nA review of participating soldiers shows many common Acadian names among those who fought in the battles of Baton Rouge and West Florida. The Galvez Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution was formed in memory of those soldiers.\nThe Spanish colonial government settled the earliest group of Acadian exiles west of New Orleans, in what is now south-central Louisiana\u2014an area known at the time as Attakapas, and later the center of the Acadiana region. As Brasseaux wrote, \"The oldest of the pioneer communities ... Fausse Point, was established near present-day Loreauville by late June 1765.\" The Acadians shared the swamps, bayous, and prairies with the Attakapa and Chitimacha Native American tribes.\nAfter the end of the American Revolutionary War, about 1,500 more Acadians arrived in New Orleans. About 3,000 Acadians had been deported to France during the Great Upheaval. In 1785, about 1,500 were authorized to emigrate to Louisiana, often to be reunited with their families, or because they could not settle in France. Living in a relatively isolated region until the early 20th century, Cajuns today are largely assimilated into the mainstream society and culture. Some Cajuns live in communities outside Louisiana. Also, some people identify themselves as Cajun culturally despite lacking Acadian ancestry.\nCajuns as Creoles.\nIn the modern era it is common to see Cajuns and Creoles discussed as separate and distinct groups; historically speaking, this was not necessarily the case. Many historical accounts exist wherein persons with Acadian surnames (and of various races) either self-identify or are described by others as Creoles.\nIn Louisiana, the French word \"Cr\u00e9ole\" (itself borrowed from Spanish and Portuguese) meant \"born in the New World\" (compare with Spanish \"Criollo\"). This label was meant to distinguish the native-born population from newly arrived European immigrants and from slaves imported from Africa. Likewise, after the Sale of Louisiana, the term \"Creole\" distinguished people of Catholic, Latin backgrounds from newly arrived Americans and other Protestant anglophones.\nIn general, \"Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9\" in Louisiana was largely defined by whether that person was born in Louisiana, spoke a Latin-based language (often French, Spanish or Creole) and practiced Catholicism. Having been born on Louisianian soil and maintaining a Catholic francophone identity, the Acadian descendants were indeed and often considered to be Creoles.\nDocuments from the late eighteenth century, such as militia rolls, make a distinction between \"Acadians\" (those born before or during \"Le Grand D\u00e9rangement\") and \"Creoles\" (those born after \"Le Grand D\u00e9rangement\"), often the children of the former group, with identical surnames and belonging to the same families. Today, members of these families\u2014including, among many others, those with surnames such as Broussard, H\u00e9bert, and Thibodeaux\u2014usually consider these names Cajun rather than Creole.\nSources from the 19th century sometimes make specific references to \"Acadian Creoles\" in particular\u2014a term entirely absent from contemporary Louisiana. One article in vol. 56 of \"The Youth's Companion\" notes that, \"The Acadian Creoles of Louisiana are a humane and charitable race\u2014simple-minded and full of queer, superstitious notions, but an orphan thrown upon their care never suffers.\" The Mouton family, an influential Acadian family of the period, provides an excellent case study in this regard, with secessionist Alexandre Mouton retaining the famous nickname of \"the Creole Hotspur.\" His son, the Confederate General Alfred Mouton, is also noted in contemporary sources as \"a brave and intrepid Creole\". Today, by contrast, members of the Mouton family are referred to as \"Acadians\" or \"Cajuns\" more often than as \"Creoles\".\nIn 1885, the \"New Iberia Enterprise\" (taken from a section of advice for American editors) wrote: \"Although all men born here, of whatever color and using whatever language, are Americans, it is the custom to designate the descendants of the old French, Spanish, and Acadian settlers of the country and using as a rule the French language, Creoles, and all using the English tongue, Americans.\"\nIn his \"Refutation des \u00e9rreurs de M. George W. Cable sur le sujet des Cr\u00e9oles\", published in L'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Louisianais, the francophone Creole John L. Peytavin accused the writer George Washington Cable of fundamentally misrepresenting Creoles to the American public. (Cable, who was not a Creole and did not speak French, had written that Cajuns of Acadian descent were not themselves Creoles.) Peytavin declared: \"The Acadian Creoles have the same right to be called Creoles as others of foreign descent.\"\nEthnic mixing and non-Acadian origins.\nCajuns do not descend solely from Acadian exiles who settled in south Louisiana in the 18th century. Cajuns include people with Irish and Spanish ancestry, and to a lesser extent of Germans and Italians; Many also have Native American, African and Afro-Latin Creole admixture. Historian Carl A. Brasseaux asserted that this process of mixing created the Cajuns in the first place.\nNon-Acadian French Creoles in rural areas were absorbed into Cajun communities. Some Cajun parishes, such as Evangeline and Avoyelles, possess relatively few inhabitants of actual Acadian origin. Their populations descend in many cases from settlers who migrated to the region from Quebec, Mobile, or directly from France (French emigration). Regardless, Acadian influences are generally acknowledged to have prevailed in most sections of south Louisiana.\nMany Cajuns have ancestors who were not French. Some of the original settlers in Louisiana were Spanish Basques and Spanish Canary Islanders. A later migration included Irish and German immigrants who began to settle in Louisiana before and after the Louisiana Purchase, particularly on the German Coast along the Mississippi River north of New Orleans. People of Latin American origin; a number of early Filipino settlers (notably in Saint Malo, Louisiana) who were known as \"Manilamen\" from the annual cross-Pacific Galleon or Manila Galleon trade with neighboring Acapulco, Mexico; descendants of African slaves; and some Cuban Americans have also settled along the Gulf Coast, and in some cases, intermarried into Cajun families.\nOne obvious result of this cultural mixture is the variety of surnames common among the Cajun population. Surnames of the original Acadian settlers (which are documented) have been augmented by French and non-French family names that have become part of Cajun communities. The spelling of many family names has changed over time. (See, for example, \"Eaux)\".\nIndian and Afro-Cajuns.\nCajuns as an ethnic group historically included Indians and Blacks. Black Louisiana Frenchmen have historically self-identified as Cajun, using the term in regards to the ethnicity of Acadiana and the language they speak: Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Ardoin for example spoke only Cajun French and at his height was known as the first Black Cajun recording artist; Clifton Chenier the King of Zydeco, routinely self-identified as a Black Cajun:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPeople of Acadiana have historically described what the Cajun nationality means to them; Brandon Moreau, a Cajun of Basile, Louisiana, described Cajun as an \"inclusive term designating region, descent, or heritage \u2013 not race.\" Moreau also described an incident of where he used the term coonass with a good friend of his: \"We were all talking in the hall, and I said I was a coonass. She said she was Cajun, but that she would never be a coonass. She's black and it offended her.\"\nCajun culture due to its mixed Latin-Creole nature had fostered more laissez-faire attitudes between blacks and whites in Acadiana more than anywhere else in the South. Roman Catholicism actively preached tolerance and condemned racism and all hate crimes; the Roman Church threatened to excommunicate any of its members who would dare to break its laws.\nAnglo-Americans openly discriminated against Cajuns because they were Catholics, had a Latin Culture, and spoke Cajun French. White Cajuns and White Creoles accepted advances in racial equality, and they had compassion for Black Cajuns, Black Creoles, and African Americans. In the 1950s, twice as many blacks in Louisiana's French-Catholic parishes registered to vote compared to blacks in the Anglo-Protestant parishes.\nAmericanization of Acadiana (1950\u20131970).\nWhen the United States of America began assimilating and Americanizing the parishes of Acadiana between the 1950s and 1970s, they imposed segregation and reorganized the inhabitants of the Cajun Country to identify racially as either \"white\" Cajuns or \"black\" Creoles. As the younger generations were made to abandon speaking French and French customs, the White or Indian Cajuns assimilated into the Anglo-American host culture, and the Black Cajuns assimilated into the African American culture.\nCajuns looked to the civil rights movement and other Black liberation and empowerment movements as a guide to fostering Louisiana's French cultural renaissance. A Cajun student protester in 1968 declared \"We're slaves to a system. Throw away the shackles... and be free with your brother.\"\nEstablishment of CODOFIL and preservation efforts.\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, attempts were made to suppress Cajun culture by measures such as forbidding the use of the Cajun French language in schools. After the Compulsory Education Act forced Cajun children to attend formal schools, English-speaking teachers threatened, punished, and sometimes beat their Cajun students in an attempt to force them to use English (a language to which many of them had not been exposed before). During World War II, Cajuns often served as French interpreters for American forces in France; this helped to overcome prejudice.\nIn 1968, the organization of Council for the Development of French in Louisiana was founded to preserve the French language in Louisiana -- not merely among Cajuns but all French-speaking Louisianians. Besides advocating for their legal rights, Cajuns also recovered ethnic pride and appreciation for their ancestry. Since the mid-1950s, relations between the Cajuns of the US Gulf Coast and Acadians in the Maritimes and New England have been renewed, forming an Acadian identity common to Louisiana, New England, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.\nState Senator Dudley LeBlanc (\"Coozan Dud\", a Cajun slang nickname for \"Cousin Dudley\") took a group of Cajuns to Nova Scotia in 1955 for the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the expulsion. The \"Congr\u00e8s Mondial Acadien\", a large gathering of Acadians and Cajuns held every five years since 1994, is another example of continued unity.\nSociologists Jacques Henry and Carl L. Bankston III have maintained that the preservation of Cajun ethnic identity is a result of the social class of Cajuns. During the 18th and 19th centuries, \"Cajuns\" came to be identified as the French-speaking rural people of Southwestern Louisiana. Over the course of the 20th century, the descendants of these rural people became the working class of their region. This change in the social and economic circumstances of families in Southwestern Louisiana created nostalgia for an idealized version of the past. Henry and Bankston point out that \"Cajun\", which was formerly considered an insulting term, became a term of pride among Louisianans by the beginning of the 21st century. It is common for persons living in the historically Cajun area of Louisiana to self-identify as Cajuns even when they have limited or no Cajun ancestry.\nEdwin W. Edwards, Constitution of 1974.\nPerhaps the greatest proponent and catalyst for reclaiming Cajun and French history of Louisiana is four-term former Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards. Selected to serve as honorary chair of the Eighteenth Century Louisiana panel of the 2014 academic Enlightenment Conference in Montr\u00e9al, the former Governor in a video address said, \"One of the legacies of which I am most proud is Louisiana's 1974 Constitution and its provision that the 'right of the people to preserve, foster, and promote their respective historic linguistic and cultural origins is recognized'.\"\nAs the late LSU Law Center professor Lee Hargrave wrote, in reference to the protection of cultural heritage, \"Proponents of the section were primarily Francophones concerned with the protection of the French Acadian culture. Representatives of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana appeared before the committee several times to urge some recognition of cultural rights, and delegates from Lafayette and Lake Charles worked strongly for the proposal.\"\nMontr\u00e9al panelist and New Orleans Cr\u00e9ole historian Jari Honora explained that Edwards \"is a perfect commentator for this panel given his advocacy for Louisiana's Francophone cultural communities during his four terms as governor. After several decades of 'Americanization' and suppression of French language and culture in Louisiana, Governor Edwards' conscious self-identification as an Acadian descendant marked a high-point for the Cajun/Creole cultural renaissance in this state.\"\nCulture.\nGeography.\nGeography had a strong correlation to Cajun lifestyles. Most Cajuns resided in Acadiana, where their descendants are still predominant. Cajun populations today are found also in the area southwest of New Orleans and scattered in areas adjacent to the French Louisiana region, such as to the north in Alexandria, Louisiana. Strong Cajun roots, influence, and culture can also be found in parts of Southern Mississippi. These areas include Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, Gulfport, Gautier, Natchez, D'Iberville, and Biloxi, Mississippi. Over the years, many Cajuns and Creoles also migrated to the Houston, Beaumont and Port Arthur areas of Southeast Texas, in especially large numbers as they followed oil-related jobs in the 1970s and 1980s, when oil companies moved jobs from Louisiana to Texas.\nMany Cajuns and Creoles of color also moved to Southern California. However, the city of Lafayette is referred to as \"The Heart of Acadiana\" because of its location, and it is a major center of Cajun culture. Despite the migration and influence in other states, cities outside of Louisiana, including these Texas cities, are not considered a part of Acadiana and are not considered a part of \"Cajun Country.\"\nMusic.\nCajun music is evolved from its roots in the music of the French-speaking Catholics of Canada. In earlier years, the fiddle was the predominant instrument, but gradually the accordion has come to share the limelight. Cajun music gained national attention in 2007, when the Grammy Award for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album category was created.\nCuisine.\nDue to \"Le Grand D\u00e9rangement\", many Acadians were invited to settle in Louisiana by the Spanish Governor Galvez. Unfamiliar with the terrain, they assimilated Creole and Native American influences into their Acadian traditions. Cajun cuisine focused on local ingredients and wild game (e.g., duck, rabbit), vegetables (e.g., okra, mirlitons), and grains. Coastal communities relied heavily on fish and shellfish. Seafood, especially shellfish, is still very popular in the region and remains a dominant feature of many classic Cajun dishes like seafood gumbo and court-bouillon.\nSince many Cajuns were farmers and not especially wealthy, they were known for not wasting any part of a butchered animal. Many rural communities held a weekly \"boucherie\", which is a communal butchering of an animal, often a pig. Each family received a share of the meat. \nSome high-profile foods like \"grattons\" and \"boudin\" are examples of Cajun cuisine that are widely popular.\nLanguage.\nLouisiana French is a variety or dialect of the French language spoken primarily in Louisiana. At one time as many as seven dialects were spread across the Cajun heartland.\nWhile Cajuns are often said to speak \"Cajun French,\" this term is increasingly seen as a misnomer because the dialect did not originate with the Acadians, and Acadian-descended people are not the only ones to speak it. Recent linguistic scholarship has also cast doubt on how much Acadian influence is present in Louisianian dialects today, and the influences that do exist are sometimes regional rather than widespread. For these reasons, the term \"Louisiana French\" is increasingly preferred.\nRecent documentation has been made of Cajun English, an often non-rhotic French-influenced dialect of English spoken by Cajuns, either as a second language, in the case of the older members of the community, or as a first language by younger Cajuns.\nReligious traditions.\n\"Our Lady of the Assumption\" is Patroness of the Acadians (Cajuns). In 1638, the colonies of France, to include Acadie, and France were consecrated by the Pope and the King to Mary under the aforementioned title; the date of consecration was August 15 which is the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and is a Holy Day of Obligation for Roman Catholics (Source 4).\nTraditional Catholic religious observances such as Mardi Gras, Lent, and Holy Week are integral to many Cajun communities. Likewise, these traditional Catholic religious observances may further be understood from \"Cultural Catholicism in Cajun-Creole Louisiana\" by Marcia Gaudet which tells that such traditional religious observances, although they may not be \"strictly theological and liturgical forms\", are still integral and necessary to many and remain religiously valid as \"unofficial religious customs and traditions are certainly a part of Roman Catholicism as it is practiced\".\nMardi Gras.\n\"Mardi Gras\" (French for \"Fat Tuesday\", also known as Shrove Tuesday) is the day before Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of Lent, a 40-day period of fasting and reflection in preparation for Easter Sunday. Mardi Gras was historically a time to use up the foods that were not to be used during Lent, including fat, eggs, and meat.\nMardi Gras celebrations in rural Acadiana are distinct from the more widely known celebrations in New Orleans and other metropolitan areas. A distinct feature of the Cajun celebration centers on the \"Courir de Mardi Gras\" (translated: fat Tuesday run). A group of men, usually on horseback and wearing capuchons (a cone-shaped ceremonial hat) and traditional costumes, approach a farmhouse and ask for something for the community gumbo pot. Often, the farmer or his wife allows the riders to have a chicken, if they can catch it. The group then puts on a show, comically attempting to catch the chicken set out in a large open area. Songs are sung, jokes are told, and skits are acted out. When the chicken is caught, it is added to the pot at the end of the day. The \"courir\" held in the small town of Mamou and Church Point has become well known. This tradition has much in common with the observance of \"La Chandeleur\", or Candlemas (February 2), by Acadians in Nova Scotia.\nEaster.\nOn \"P\u00e2ques\" (French for Easter), a game called \"p\u00e2quer\", or \"p\u00e2que-p\u00e2que\" was played. Contestants selected hard-boiled eggs, paired off, and tapped the eggs together \u2013 the player whose egg did not crack was declared the winner. This is an old European tradition that has survived in Acadia until today. Today, Easter is still celebrated by Cajuns with the traditional game of \"paque\", but is now also celebrated in the same fashion as Christians throughout the United States with candy-filled baskets, \"Easter bunny\" stories, dyed eggs, and Easter egg hunts.\nFolk beliefs.\nOne folk custom is belief in a \"traiteur\", or healer, whose primary method of treatment involves the laying on of hands and of prayers. An important part of this folk religion, the \"traiteur\" combines Catholic prayer and medicinal remedies to treat a variety of ailments, including earaches, toothaches, warts, tumors, angina, and bleeding. Another is in the \"rougarou\", a version of a \"loup garou\" (French for werewolf), that will hunt down and kill Catholics who do not follow the rules of Lent. In some communities, the \"loup garou\" of legend has taken on an almost protective role. Children are warned that \"loups garous\" can read souls, and that they only hunt and kill evil men and women and misbehaved horses. The folkloric creature \"letiche\" is said to be the soul of an unbaptized infant or child raised by alligators that haunts the bayous.\nCelebrations and gatherings.\nCajuns, along with other Cajun Country residents, have a reputation for a \"joie de vivre\" (French for \"joy of living\"), in which hard work is appreciated as much as \"let the good times roll / laissez les bon temps rouler\".\nCommunity gatherings.\nIn the culture, a \"coup de main\" (French for \"to give a hand\") is an occasion when the community gathers to assist one of their members with time-consuming or arduous tasks. Examples might include a barn raising, harvests, or assistance for the elderly or sick.\nFestivals.\nThe majority of Cajun festivals include a \"fais do-do\" (\"go to sleep\" in French, originating from encouraging children to fall asleep in the rafters of the dance hall as the parents danced late into the night) or street dance, usually to a live local band. Crowds at these festivals can range from a few hundred to more than 100,000.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and remove contaminants from the air. HVAC system design is a subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, based on the principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. Modern HVAC designs focus on energy efficiency and sustainability, especially with the rising demand for green building solutions. In modern construction, MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) engineers integrate HVAC systems with energy modeling techniques to optimize system performance and reduce operational costs. \"Refrigeration\" is sometimes added to the field's abbreviation as HVAC&amp;R or HVACR, or \"ventilation\" is dropped, as in HACR (as in the designation of HACR-rated circuit breakers). \nHVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels, and senior living facilities; medium to large industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and hospitals; vehicles such as cars, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines; and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.\nVentilation is the process of replacing or exchanging air within a space to regulate temperature and remove moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other contaminants, while also replenishing oxygen.\nVentilating or ventilation (the \"V\" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, and keeps interior air circulating. Building ventilation methods are categorized as mechanical (forced) or natural.\nOverview.\nThe three major functions of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning are interrelated, especially with the need to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality within reasonable installation, operation, and maintenance costs. HVAC systems can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. HVAC systems can provide ventilation, and maintain pressure relationships between spaces. The means of air delivery and removal from spaces is known as room air distribution.\nIndividual systems.\nIn modern buildings, the design, installation, and control systems of these functions are integrated into one or more HVAC systems. For very small buildings, contractors normally estimate the capacity and type of system needed and then design the system, selecting the appropriate refrigerant and various components needed. For larger buildings, building service designers, mechanical engineers, or building services engineers analyze, design, and specify the HVAC systems. Specialty mechanical contractors and suppliers then fabricate, install and commission the systems. Building permits and code-compliance inspections of the installations are normally required for all sizes of buildings.\nDistrict networks.\nAlthough HVAC is executed in individual buildings or other enclosed spaces (like NORAD's underground headquarters), the equipment involved is in some cases an extension of a larger district heating (DH) or district cooling (DC) network, or a combined DHC network. In such cases, the operating and maintenance aspects are simplified and metering becomes necessary to bill for the energy that is consumed, and in some cases energy that is returned to the larger system. For example, at a given time one building may be utilizing chilled water for air conditioning and the warm water it returns may be used in another building for heating, or for the overall heating-portion of the DHC network (likely with energy added to boost the temperature).\nBasing HVAC on a larger network helps provide an economy of scale that is often not possible for individual buildings, for utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar heat, winter's cold, the cooling potential in some places of lakes or seawater for free cooling, and the enabling function of seasonal thermal energy storage. Utilizing natural sources for HVAC can significantly benefit the environment and promote awareness of alternative methods.\nHistory.\nHVAC is based on inventions and discoveries made by Nikolay Lvov, Michael Faraday, Rolla C. Carpenter, Willis Carrier, Edwin Ruud, Reuben Trane, James Joule, William Rankine, Sadi Carnot, Alice Parker and many others.\nMultiple inventions within this time frame preceded the beginnings of the first comfort air conditioning system, which was designed in 1902 by Alfred Wolff (Cooper, 2003) for the New York Stock Exchange, while Willis Carrier equipped the Sacketts-Wilhems Printing Company with the process AC unit the same year. Coyne College was the first school to offer HVAC training in 1899. The first residential AC was installed by 1914, and by the 1950s there was \"widespread adoption of residential AC\".\nThe invention of the components of HVAC systems went hand-in-hand with the Industrial Revolution, and new methods of modernization, higher efficiency, and system control are constantly being introduced by companies and inventors worldwide.\nHeating.\nHeaters are appliances whose purpose is to generate heat (i.e. warmth) for the building. This can be done via central heating. Such a system contains a boiler, furnace, or heat pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a furnace room in a home, or a mechanical room in a large building. The heat can be transferred by convection, conduction, or radiation. Space heaters are used to heat single rooms and only consist of a single unit.\nGeneration.\nHeaters exist for various types of fuel, including solid fuels, liquids, and gases. Another type of heat source is electricity, normally heating ribbons composed of high resistance wire (see Nichrome). This principle is also used for baseboard heaters and portable heaters. Electrical heaters are often used as backup or supplemental heat for heat pump systems.\nThe heat pump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. Heat pumps can extract heat from various sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air inside. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate climates, but with improvements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more efficient homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates. They can also operate in reverse to cool an interior.\nDistribution.\nWater/steam.\nIn the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the rooms. Most modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.\nThe use of water as the heat transfer medium is known as hydronics. The heated water can also supply an auxiliary heat exchanger to supply hot water for bathing and washing.\nAir.\nWarm air systems distribute the heated air through ductwork systems of supply and return air through metal or fiberglass ducts. Many systems use the same ducts to distribute air cooled by an evaporator coil for air conditioning. The air supply is normally filtered through air filters to remove dust and pollen particles.\nDangers.\nThe use of furnaces, space heaters, and boilers as a method of indoor heating could result in incomplete combustion and the emission of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds, and other combustion byproducts. Incomplete combustion occurs when there is insufficient oxygen; the inputs are fuels containing various contaminants and the outputs are harmful byproducts, most dangerously carbon monoxide, which is a tasteless and odorless gas with serious adverse health effects.\nWithout proper ventilation, carbon monoxide can be lethal at concentrations of 1000 ppm (0.1%). However, at several hundred ppm, carbon monoxide exposure induces headaches, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin in the blood, forming carboxyhemoglobin, reducing the blood's ability to transport oxygen. The primary health concerns associated with carbon monoxide exposure are its cardiovascular and neurobehavioral effects. Carbon monoxide can cause atherosclerosis (the hardening of arteries) and can also trigger heart attacks. Neurologically, carbon monoxide exposure reduces hand to eye coordination, vigilance, and continuous performance. It can also affect time discrimination.\nVentilation.\nVentilation is the process of changing or replacing air in any space to control the temperature or remove any combination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, or carbon dioxide, and to replenish oxygen. It plays a critical role in maintaining a healthy indoor environment by preventing the buildup of harmful pollutants and ensuring the circulation of fresh air. Different methods, such as natural ventilation through windows and mechanical ventilation systems, can be used depending on the building design and air quality needs. Ventilation often refers to the intentional delivery of the outside air to the building indoor space. It is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings. \nAlthough ventilation plays a key role in indoor air quality, it may not be sufficient on its own. A clear understanding of both indoor and outdoor air quality parameters is needed to improve the performance of ventilation in terms of ... In scenarios where outdoor pollution would deteriorate indoor air quality, other treatment devices such as filtration may also be necessary. \nMethods for ventilating a building may be divided into \"mechanical/forced\" and \"natural\" types.\nMechanical or forced.\nMechanical, or forced, ventilation is provided by an air handler (AHU) and used to control indoor air quality. Excess humidity, odors, and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air. However, in humid climates more energy is required to remove excess moisture from ventilation air.\nKitchens and bathrooms typically have mechanical exhausts to control odors and sometimes humidity. Factors in the design of such systems include the flow rate (which is a function of the fan speed and exhaust vent size) and noise level. Direct drive fans are available for many applications and can reduce maintenance needs.\nIn summer, ceiling fans and table/floor fans circulate air within a room for the purpose of reducing the perceived temperature by increasing evaporation of perspiration on the skin of the occupants. Because hot air rises, ceiling fans may be used to keep a room warmer in the winter by circulating the warm stratified air from the ceiling to the floor.\nPassive.\nNatural ventilation is the ventilation of a building with outside air without using fans or other mechanical systems. It can be via operable windows, louvers, or trickle vents when spaces are small and the architecture permits. ASHRAE defined Natural ventilation as the flow of air through open windows, doors, grilles, and other planned building envelope penetrations, and as being driven by natural and/or artificially produced pressure differentials.\nNatural ventilation strategies also include cross ventilation, which relies on wind pressure differences on opposite sides of a building. By strategically placing openings, such as windows or vents, on opposing walls, air is channeled through the space to enhance cooling and ventilation. Cross ventilation is most effective when there are clear, unobstructed paths for airflow within the building.\nIn more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to rise and flow out high building openings to the outside (stack effect), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use very little energy, but care must be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or humid climates, maintaining thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.\nAn important component of natural ventilation is air change rate or air changes per hour: the hourly rate of ventilation divided by the volume of the space. For example, six air changes per hour means an amount of new air, equal to the volume of the space, is added every ten minutes. For human comfort, a minimum of four air changes per hour is typical, though warehouses might have only two. Too high of an air change rate may be uncomfortable, akin to a wind tunnel which has thousands of changes per hour. The highest air change rates are for crowded spaces, bars, night clubs, commercial kitchens at around 30 to 50 air changes per hour.\nRoom pressure can be either positive or negative with respect to outside the room. Positive pressure occurs when there is more air being supplied than exhausted, and is common to reduce the infiltration of outside contaminants.\nAirborne diseases.\nNatural ventilation is a key factor in reducing the spread of airborne illnesses such as tuberculosis, the common cold, influenza, meningitis or COVID-19. Opening doors and windows are good ways to maximize natural ventilation, which would make the risk of airborne contagion much lower than with costly and maintenance-requiring mechanical systems. Old-fashioned clinical areas with high ceilings and large windows provide the greatest protection. Natural ventilation costs little and is maintenance free, and is particularly suited to limited-resource settings and tropical climates, where the burden of TB and institutional TB transmission is highest. In settings where respiratory isolation is difficult and climate permits, windows and doors should be opened to reduce the risk of airborne contagion. Natural ventilation requires little maintenance and is inexpensive.\nNatural ventilation is not practical in much of the infrastructure because of climate. This means that the facilities need to have effective mechanical ventilation systems and or use Ceiling Level UV or FAR UV ventilation systems.\nVentilation is measured in terms of Air Changes Per Hour (ACH). As of 2023, the CDC recommends that all spaces have a minimum of 5 ACH. For hospital rooms with airborne contagions the CDC recommends a minimum of 12 ACH. The challenges in facility ventilation are public unawareness, ineffective government oversight, poor building codes that are based on comfort levels, poor system operations, poor maintenance, and lack of transparency.\nUVC or Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation is a function used in modern air conditioners which reduces airborne viruses, bacteria, and fungi, through the use of a built-in LED UV light that emits a gentle glow across the evaporator. As the cross-flow fan circulates the room air, any viruses are guided through the sterilization module\u2019s irradiation range, rendering them instantly inactive.\nAir conditioning.\nAn air conditioning system, or a standalone air conditioner, provides cooling and/or humidity control for all or part of a building. Air conditioned buildings often have sealed windows, because open windows would work against the system intended to maintain constant indoor air conditions. Outside, fresh air is generally drawn into the system by a vent into a mix air chamber for mixing with the space return air. Then the mixture air enters an indoor or outdoor heat exchanger section where the air is to be cooled down, then be guided to the space creating positive air pressure. The percentage of return air made up of fresh air can usually be manipulated by adjusting the opening of this vent. Typical fresh air intake is about 10% of the total supply air.\nAir conditioning and refrigeration are provided through the removal of heat. Heat can be removed through radiation, convection, or conduction. The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as refrigerants. A refrigerant is employed either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is used to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a free cooling system that uses pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (typically water or a glycol mix).\nIt is imperative that the air conditioning horsepower is sufficient for the area being cooled. Underpowered air conditioning systems will lead to power wastage and inefficient usage. Adequate horsepower is required for any air conditioner installed.\nRefrigeration cycle.\nThe refrigeration cycle uses four essential elements to cool, which are compressor, condenser, metering device, and evaporator.\nIn variable climates, the system may include a reversing valve that switches from heating in winter to cooling in summer. By reversing the flow of refrigerant, the heat pump refrigeration cycle is changed from cooling to heating or vice versa. This allows a facility to be heated and cooled by a single piece of equipment by the same means, and with the same hardware.\nFree cooling.\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.\nSome systems include an \"economizer mode\", which is sometimes called a \"free-cooling mode\". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion \"DX\" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.\nPackaged split system.\nCentral, \"all-air\" air-conditioning systems (or package systems) with a combined outdoor condenser/evaporator unit are often installed in North American residences, offices, and public buildings, but are difficult to retrofit (install in a building that was not designed to receive it) because of the bulky air ducts required. (Minisplit ductless systems are used in these situations.) Outside of North America, packaged systems are only used in limited applications involving large indoor space such as stadiums, theatres or exhibition halls.\nAn alternative to packaged systems is the use of separate indoor and outdoor coils in split systems. Split systems are preferred and widely used worldwide except in North America. In North America, split systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are gaining popularity in small commercial buildings. Split systems are used where ductwork is not feasible or where the space conditioning efficiency is of prime concern. The benefits of ductless air conditioning systems include easy installation, no ductwork, greater zonal control, flexibility of control, and quiet operation. In space conditioning, the duct losses can account for 30% of energy consumption. The use of minisplits can result in energy savings in space conditioning as there are no losses associated with ducting.\nWith the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.\nSplit systems are more efficient and the footprint is typically smaller than the package systems. On the other hand, package systems tend to have a slightly lower indoor noise level compared to split systems since the fan motor is located outside.\nDehumidification.\nDehumidification (air drying) in an air conditioning system is provided by the evaporator. Since the evaporator operates at a temperature below the dew point, moisture in the air condenses on the evaporator coil tubes. This moisture is collected at the bottom of the evaporator in a pan and removed by piping to a central drain or onto the ground outside.\nA dehumidifier is an air-conditioner-like device that controls the humidity of a room or building. It is often employed in basements that have a higher relative humidity because of their lower temperature (and propensity for damp floors and walls). In food retailing establishments, large open chiller cabinets are highly effective at dehumidifying the internal air. Conversely, a humidifier increases the humidity of a building.\nThe HVAC components that dehumidify the ventilation air deserve careful attention because outdoor air constitutes most of the annual humidity load for nearly all buildings.\nMaintenance.\nAll modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop airflow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, which can result in damage to the system or even fire.\nBecause an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.\nEnergy efficiency.\nHVAC systems play a key role in improving the energy efficiency of buildings, as the building sector accounts for one of the highest shares of global energy consumption. Since the 1980s, HVAC equipment manufacturers have focused on improving system efficiency. Initially, these efforts were driven by rising energy costs, but in recent years, environmental sustainability and stricter efficiency regulations have become the primary motivators. Additionally, improving HVAC system efficiency can enhance indoor air quality, which may lead to better occupant health, comfort, and productivity. In the US, the EPA has imposed tighter restrictions over the years. There are several methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.\nHeating energy.\nIn the past, water heating was more efficient for heating buildings and was the standard in the United States. Today, forced air systems can double for air conditioning and are more popular.\nSome benefits of forced air systems, which are now widely used in churches, schools, and high-end residences, are\nA drawback is the installation cost, which can be slightly higher than traditional HVAC systems.\nEnergy efficiency can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very critical to maintaining a proper temperature.\nForecasting is another method of controlling building heating by calculating the demand for heating energy that should be supplied to the building in each time unit.\nGround source heat pump.\nGround source, or geothermal, heat pumps are similar to ordinary heat pumps, but instead of transferring heat to or from outside air, they rely on the stable, even temperature of the earth to provide heating and air conditioning. Many regions experience seasonal temperature extremes, which would require large-capacity heating and cooling equipment to heat or cool buildings. For example, a conventional heat pump system used to heat a building in Montana's low temperature or cool a building in the highest temperature ever recorded in the US\u2014 in Death Valley, California, in 1913 would require a large amount of energy due to the extreme difference between inside and outside air temperatures. A metre below the earth's surface, however, the ground remains at a relatively constant temperature. Utilizing this large source of relatively moderate temperature earth, a heating or cooling system's capacity can often be significantly reduced. Although ground temperatures vary according to latitude, at underground, temperatures generally only range from .\nSolar air conditioning.\nPhotovoltaic solar panels offer a new way to potentially decrease the operating cost of air conditioning. Traditional air conditioners run using alternating current, and hence, any direct-current solar power needs to be inverted to be compatible with these units. New variable-speed DC-motor units allow solar power to more easily run them since this conversion is unnecessary, and since the motors are tolerant of voltage fluctuations associated with variance in supplied solar power (e.g., due to cloud cover).\nVentilation energy recovery.\nEnergy recovery systems sometimes utilize heat recovery ventilation or energy recovery ventilation systems that employ heat exchangers or enthalpy wheels to recover sensible or latent heat from exhausted air. This is done by transfer of energy from the stale air inside the home to the incoming fresh air from outside.\nAir conditioning energy.\nThe performance of vapor compression refrigeration cycles is limited by thermodynamics. These air conditioning and heat pump devices \"move\" heat rather than convert it from one form to another, so \"thermal efficiencies\" do not appropriately describe the performance of these devices. The Coefficient of performance (COP) measures performance, but this dimensionless measure has not been adopted. Instead, the Energy Efficiency Ratio (\"EER\") has traditionally been used to characterize the performance of many HVAC systems. EER is the Energy Efficiency Ratio based on a outdoor temperature. To more accurately describe the performance of air conditioning equipment over a typical cooling season a modified version of the EER, the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (\"SEER\"), or in Europe the ESEER, is used. SEER ratings are based on seasonal temperature averages instead of a constant outdoor temperature. The current industry minimum SEER rating is 14 SEER. Engineers have pointed out some areas where efficiency of the existing hardware could be improved. For example, the fan blades used to move the air are usually stamped from sheet metal, an economical method of manufacture, but as a result they are not aerodynamically efficient. A well-designed blade could reduce the electrical power required to move the air by a third.\nDemand-controlled kitchen ventilation.\nDemand-controlled kitchen ventilation (DCKV) is a building controls approach to controlling the volume of kitchen exhaust and supply air in response to the actual cooking loads in a commercial kitchen. Traditional commercial kitchen ventilation systems operate at 100% fan speed independent of the volume of cooking activity and DCKV technology changes that to provide significant fan energy and conditioned air savings. By deploying smart sensing technology, both the exhaust and supply fans can be controlled to capitalize on the affinity laws for motor energy savings, reduce makeup air heating and cooling energy, increasing safety, and reducing ambient kitchen noise levels.\nAir filtration and cleaning.\nAir cleaning and filtration removes particles, contaminants, vapors and gases from the air. The filtered and cleaned air then is used in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Air cleaning and filtration should be taken in account when protecting our building environments. If present, contaminants can come out from the HVAC systems if not removed or filtered properly.\nClean air delivery rate (CADR) is the amount of clean air an air cleaner provides to a room or space. When determining CADR, the amount of airflow in a space is taken into account. For example, an air cleaner with a flow rate of per minute and an efficiency of 50% has a CADR of per minute. Along with CADR, filtration performance is very important when it comes to the air in our indoor environment. This depends on the size of the particle or fiber, the filter packing density and depth, and the airflow rate.\nIndustry and standards.\nThe HVAC industry is a worldwide enterprise, with roles including operation and maintenance, system design and construction, equipment manufacturing and sales, and in education and research. The HVAC industry was historically regulated by the manufacturers of HVAC equipment, but regulating and standards organizations such as HARDI (Heating, Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Distributors International), ASHRAE, SMACNA, ACCA (Air Conditioning Contractors of America), Uniform Mechanical Code, International Mechanical Code, and AMCA have been established to support the industry and encourage high standards and achievement. (UL as an omnibus agency is not specific to the HVAC industry.)\nThe starting point in carrying out an estimate both for cooling and heating depends on the exterior climate and interior specified conditions. However, before taking up the heat load calculation, it is necessary to find fresh air requirements for each area in detail, as pressurization is an important consideration.\nInternational.\nISO 16813:2006 is one of the ISO building environment standards. It establishes the general principles of building environment design. It takes into account the need to provide a healthy indoor environment for the occupants as well as the need to protect the environment for future generations and promote collaboration among the various parties involved in building environmental design for sustainability. ISO16813 is applicable to new construction and the retrofit of existing buildings.\nThe building environmental design standard aims to:\nUnited States.\nLicensing.\nIn the United States, federal licensure is generally handled by EPA certified (for installation and service of HVAC devices).\nMany U.S. states have licensing for boiler operation. Some of these are listed as follows:\nFinally, some U.S. cities may have additional labor laws that apply to HVAC professionals.\nSocieties.\nMany HVAC engineers are members of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). ASHRAE regularly organizes two annual technical committees and publishes recognized standards for HVAC design, which are updated every four years.\nAnother popular society is AHRI, which provides regular information on new refrigeration technology, and publishes relevant standards and codes.\nCodes.\nCodes such as the UMC and IMC do include much detail on installation requirements, however. Other useful reference materials include items from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.\nAmerican design standards are legislated in the Uniform Mechanical Code or International Mechanical Code. In certain states, counties, or cities, either of these codes may be adopted and amended via various legislative processes. These codes are updated and published by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) or the International Code Council (ICC) respectively, on a 3-year code development cycle. Typically, local building permit departments are charged with enforcement of these standards on private and certain public properties.\nTechnicians.\nAn HVAC technician is a tradesman who specializes in heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration. HVAC technicians in the US can receive training through formal training institutions, where most earn associate degrees. Training for HVAC technicians includes classroom lectures and hands-on tasks, and can be followed by an apprenticeship wherein the recent graduate works alongside a professional HVAC technician for a temporary period. HVAC techs who have been trained can also be certified in areas such as air conditioning, heat pumps, gas heating, and commercial refrigeration.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers is a body that covers the essential Service (systems architecture) that allow buildings to operate. It includes the electrotechnical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, refrigeration and plumbing industries. To train as a building services engineer, the academic requirements are GCSEs (A-C) / Standard Grades (1-3) in Maths and Science, which are important in measurements, planning and theory. Employers will often want a degree in a branch of engineering, such as building environment engineering, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. To become a full member of CIBSE, and so also to be registered by the Engineering Council UK as a chartered engineer, engineers must also attain an Honours Degree and a master's degree in a relevant engineering subject. CIBSE publishes several guides to HVAC design relevant to the UK market, and also the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. These guides include various recommended design criteria and standards, some of which are cited within the UK building regulations, and therefore form a legislative requirement for major building services works. The main guides are:\nWithin the construction sector, it is the job of the building services engineer to design and oversee the installation and maintenance of the essential services such as gas, electricity, water, heating and lighting, as well as many others. These all help to make buildings comfortable and healthy places to live and work in. Building Services is part of a sector that has over 51,000 businesses and employs represents 2\u20133% of the GDP.\nAustralia.\nThe Air Conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association of Australia (AMCA), Australian Institute of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heating (AIRAH), Australian Refrigeration Mechanical Association and CIBSE are responsible.\nAsia.\nAsian architectural temperature-control have different priorities than European methods. For example, Asian heating traditionally focuses on maintaining temperatures of objects such as the floor or furnishings such as Kotatsu tables and directly warming people, as opposed to the Western focus, in modern periods, on designing air systems.\nPhilippines.\nThe Philippine Society of Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigerating Engineers (PSVARE) along with Philippine Society of Mechanical Engineers (PSME) govern on the codes and standards for HVAC / MVAC (MVAC means \"mechanical ventilation and air conditioning\") in the Philippines.\nIndia.\nThe Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ISHRAE) was established to promote the HVAC industry in India. ISHRAE is an associate of ASHRAE. ISHRAE was founded at New Delhi in 1981 and a chapter was started in Bangalore in 1989. Between 1989 &amp; 1993, ISHRAE chapters were formed in all major cities in India.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57172", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57172", "title": "Peasants' Revolt", "text": "1381 uprising in England\nThe Peasants' Revolt, also named Wat Tyler's Rebellion or the Great Rising, was a major uprising across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years' War, and instability within the local leadership of London. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. \nInterpretations of the revolt by academics have shifted over the years. It was once seen as a defining moment in English history, in particular causing a promise by King Richard II to abolish serfdom, and a suspicion of Lollardy, but modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. \nThe revolt has been widely used in socialist literature, including by the author William Morris, and remains a potent symbol for the political left, informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the Community Charge in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTerminology.\nThe term \"Peasants' Revolt\" does not occur in medieval sources: contemporary chronicles did not give the events a specific title, and the term \"peasant\" did not appear in the English language until the 15th century. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was generally known as \"the Insurrection of Wat Tyler\". Though he commented that \"which eighteenth- or nineteenth-century historian first used the doubly discredited phrase 'Peasants' Revolt' I have been unable to determine\", Paul Strohm's first identified usage of the term was in John Richard Green's \"Short History of the English People\" in 1874. The name has been critiqued by modern historians such as Strohm and Miri Rubin, both on the grounds that many in the movements were not peasants, and that the events more closely resemble a prolonged protest or rising rather than a revolt or rebellion. Alternative terms include \"the 1381 Rising\" and \"the English\nRising of 1381\".\nBackground and causes.\nEconomics.\nThe Peasants' Revolt was fed by the economic and social upheaval of the 14th century. At the start of the century, the majority of English people worked in the countryside economy that fed the country's towns and cities and supported an extensive international trade. Across much of England, production was organised around manors, controlled by local lords\u00a0\u2013 including the gentry and the Church\u00a0\u2013 and governed through a system of manorial courts. Some of the population were unfree serfs, who had to work on their lords' lands for a period of time each year, though the balance of free and unfree varied across England, and in the south-east serfdom was relatively rare. Some serfs were born unfree and could not leave their manors to work elsewhere without the consent of the local lord; others accepted limitations on their freedom as part of the tenure agreement for their farmland. Population growth led to pressure on the available agricultural land, increasing the power of local landowners.\nIn 1348 a plague known as the Black Death crossed from mainland Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 percent of the population. After an initial period of economic shock, England began to adapt to the changed economic situation. The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and labourers in much shorter supply. Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards. In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded. The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.\nThe authorities responded to the chaos by passing emergency legislation, the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making it a crime to refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed. The system was initially enforced through special Justices of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal Justices of the Peace, typically members of the local gentry. Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking higher wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion. The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include branding and imprisonment. The royal government had not intervened in this way before, nor allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.\nOver the next few decades, economic opportunities increased for the English peasantry. Some labourers took up specialist jobs that would have previously been barred to them, and others moved from employer to employer, or became servants in richer households. These changes were keenly felt across the south-east of England, where the London market created a wide range of opportunities for farmers and artisans. Local lords had the right to prevent serfs from leaving their manors, but when serfs found themselves blocked in the manorial courts, many simply left to work illegally on manors elsewhere. Wages continued to rise, and between the 1340s and the 1380s the purchasing power of rural labourers increased by around 40 percent. As the wealth of the lower classes increased, Parliament brought in fresh laws in 1363 to prevent them from consuming expensive goods formerly only affordable by the elite. These sumptuary laws proved unenforceable, but the wider labour laws continued to be firmly applied.\nWar and finance.\nAnother factor in the revolt of 1381 was the conduct of the war with France. In 1337 Edward III of England had pressed his claims to the French throne, beginning a long-running conflict that became known as the Hundred Years' War. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. Charles V of France became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England. By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in Calais and Brest alone, for example, were costing \u00a336,000 a year to maintain, while military expeditions could consume \u00a350,000 in only six months. Edward died in 1377, leaving the throne to his grandson, Richard II, then only ten years old.\nRichard's government was formed around his uncles, most prominently the rich and powerful John of Gaunt, and many of his grandfather's former senior officials. They faced the challenge of financially sustaining the war in France. Taxes in the 14th century were raised on an \"ad hoc\" basis through Parliament, then comprising the Lords, the titled aristocracy and clergy; and the Commons, the representatives of the knights, merchants and senior gentry from across England. These taxes were typically imposed on a household's movable possessions, such as their goods or stock. The raising of these taxes affected the members of the Commons much more than the Lords. To complicate matters, the official statistics used to administer the taxes pre-dated the Black Death and, since the size and wealth of local communities had changed greatly since the plague, effective collection had become increasingly difficult.\nJust before Edward's death, Parliament introduced a new form of taxation called the poll tax, which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples. Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised \u00a322,000. The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds. The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption. A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms. Widespread evasion proved to be a problem, and the tax only raised \u00a318,600\u00a0\u2013 far short of the \u00a350,000 that had been hoped for.\nIn November 1380, Parliament was called together again in Northampton. Archbishop Simon Sudbury, the new Lord Chancellor, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, and the risk of the Crown having to default on its debts. The Commons were told that the colossal sum of \u00a3160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next. Parliament passed a third poll tax (this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples) which they estimated would raise \u00a366,666. The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing to register. The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply. The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the taxes.\nProtest and authority.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n...from the beginning all men by nature were created alike...\n\u2013John Ball, 1381\nThe decades running up to 1381 were a rebellious, troubled period. London was a particular focus of unrest, and the activities of the city's politically active guilds and fraternities often alarmed the authorities. Londoners resented the expansion of the royal legal system in the capital, in particular the increased role of the Marshalsea Court in Southwark, which had begun to compete with the city authorities for judicial power in London. The city's population also resented the presence of foreigners, Flemish weavers in particular. Londoners detested John of Gaunt because he was a supporter of the religious reformer John Wycliffe, whom the London public regarded as a heretic. John of Gaunt was also engaged in a feud with the London elite and was rumoured to be planning to replace the elected mayor with a captain, appointed by the Crown. This led to riots in 1377. The London elite were themselves fighting out a vicious, internal battle for political power. As a result, in 1381 the ruling classes in London were unstable and divided.\nRural communities, particularly in the south-east, were unhappy with the operation of serfdom and the use of the local manorial courts to exact traditional fines and levies, not least because the same landowners who ran these courts also often acted as enforcers of the unpopular labour laws or as royal judges. Many of the village elites refused to take up positions in local government and began to frustrate the operation of the courts. Animals seized by the courts began to be retaken by their owners, and legal officials were assaulted. Some started to advocate the creation of independent village communities, respecting traditional laws but separate from the hated legal system centred in London. As the historian Miri Rubin describes, for many, \"the problem was not the country's laws, but those charged with applying and safeguarding them\".\nConcerns were raised about these changes in society. William Langland wrote the poem \"Piers Plowman\" in the years before 1380, praising peasants who respected the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages. The poet John Gower warned against a future revolt in both \"Mirour de l'Omme\" and \"Vox Clamantis\". There was a moral panic about the threat posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters. New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy laws were more widely applied and the treason laws were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands. By the 1370s, there were fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.\nThe discontent began to give way to open protest. In 1377, the \"Great Rumour\" occurred in south-east and south-west England. Rural workers organised themselves and refused to work for their lords, arguing that, according to the Domesday Book, they were exempted from such requests. The workers made unsuccessful appeals to the law courts and the King. There were also widespread urban tensions, particularly in London, where John of Gaunt narrowly escaped being lynched. The troubles increased again in 1380, with protests and disturbances across northern England and in the western towns of Shrewsbury and Bridgwater. An uprising occurred in York, during which John de Gisborne, the city's mayor, was removed from office, and fresh tax riots followed in early 1381. There was a great storm in England during May 1381, which many felt to prophesy future change and upheaval, adding further to the disturbed mood.\nEvents.\nOverview.\nThe final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in Essex on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the southeast of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local prisons. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, an end to serfdom, and the removal of King Richard II's senior officials and law courts.\nInspired by the sermons of the radical cleric John Ball and led by Wat Tyler, a contingent of Kentish rebels advanced on London. They were met at Blackheath by representatives of the royal government, aldermen John Horn, Adam Karlille and John Frosh, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade them to return home. King Richard, then aged 14, retreated to the safety of the Tower of London, but most of the royal forces were abroad or in northern England. On 13 June, the rebels entered London and, joined by many local townsfolk, attacked the prisons, destroyed the Savoy Palace, set fire to law books and buildings in the Temple, and killed anyone associated with the royal government. The following day, Richard met the rebels at Mile End and agreed to most of their demands, including the abolition of serfdom. Meanwhile, rebels entered the Tower of London, killing Simon Sudbury, Lord Chancellor, and Robert Hales, Lord High Treasurer, whom they found inside.\nOn 15 June, Richard left the city to meet Tyler and the rebels at Smithfield. Violence broke out, and Richard's party killed Tyler. Richard defused the tense situation long enough for London's mayor, William Walworth, to gather a militia from the city and disperse the rebel forces. Richard immediately began to re-establish order in London and rescinded his previous grants to the rebels. The revolt had also spread into East Anglia, where the University of Cambridge was attacked and many royal officials were killed. Unrest continued until the intervention of Henry Despenser, who defeated a rebel army at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June. Troubles extended north to York, Beverley, and Scarborough, and as far west as Bridgwater in Somerset. Richard mobilised 4,000 soldiers to restore order. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed; by November, at least 1,500 rebels had been killed.\nOutbreak of the revolt.\nEssex and Kent.\nThe revolt of 1381 broke out in Essex, following the arrival of John Bampton to investigate non-payment of the poll tax on 30 May. Bampton was a Member of Parliament, a Justice of the Peace and well-connected with royal circles. He based himself in Brentwood and summoned representatives from the neighbouring villages of Corringham, Fobbing and Stanford-le-Hope to explain and make good the shortfalls on 1 June. The villagers appear to have arrived well-organised, and armed with old bows and sticks. Bampton first interrogated the people of Fobbing, whose representative, Thomas Baker, declared that his village had already paid their taxes, and that no more money would be forthcoming. When Bampton and two sergeants attempted to arrest Baker, violence broke out. Bampton escaped and retreated to London, but three of his clerks and several of the Brentwood townsfolk who had agreed to act as jurors were killed. Robert Bealknap, the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, who was probably already holding court in the area, was empowered to arrest and deal with the perpetrators.\nBy the next day, the revolt was rapidly growing. The villagers spread the news across the region, and John Geoffrey, a local bailiff, rode between Brentwood and Chelmsford, rallying support. On 4 June, the rebels gathered at Bocking, where their future plans seem to have been discussed. The Essex rebels, possibly a few thousand strong, advanced towards London, some probably travelling directly and others via Kent. One group, under the leadership of John Wrawe, a former chaplain, marched north towards the neighbouring county of Suffolk, with the intention of raising a revolt there.\nRevolt also flared in neighbouring Kent. Sir Simon de Burley, a close associate of both Edward III and the young Richard, had claimed that a man in Kent, called Robert Belling, was an escaped serf from one of his estates. Burley sent two sergeants to Gravesend, where Belling was living, to reclaim him. Gravesend's local bailiffs and Belling tried to negotiate a solution under which Burley would accept a sum of money in return for dropping his case, but this failed and Belling was taken away to be imprisoned at Rochester Castle. A furious group of local people gathered at Dartford, possibly on 5 June, to discuss the matter. From there the rebels travelled to Maidstone, where they stormed the prison, and then on to Rochester on 6 June. Faced by the angry crowds, the constable in charge of Rochester Castle surrendered it without a fight and Belling was freed.\nSome of the Kentish crowds now dispersed, but others continued. From this point, they appear to have been led by Wat Tyler, whom the \"Anonimalle Chronicle\" suggests was elected their leader at a large gathering at Maidstone on 7 June. Relatively little is known about Tyler's former life; chroniclers suggest that he was from Essex, had served in France as an archer and was a charismatic and capable leader. Several chroniclers believe that he was responsible for shaping the political aims of the revolt. Some also mention a Jack Straw as a leader among the Kentish rebels during this phase in the revolt, but it is uncertain if this was a real person, or a pseudonym for Wat Tyler or John Wrawe.\nTyler and the Kentish men advanced to Canterbury, entering the walled city and castle without resistance on 10 June. The rebels deposed the absent Archbishop of Canterbury, Sudbury, and made the cathedral monks swear loyalty to their cause. They attacked properties in the city with links to the hated royal council, and searched the city for suspected enemies, dragging the suspects out of their houses and executing them. The city prison was opened and the prisoners freed. Tyler then persuaded a few thousand of the rebels to leave Canterbury and advance with him on London the next morning.\nMarch on the capital.\nThe Kentish advance on London appears to have been coordinated with the movement of the rebels in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. Their forces were armed with weapons including sticks, battle axes, old swords and bows. Along their way, they encountered Lady Joan, the King's mother, who was travelling back to the capital to avoid being caught up in the revolt; she was mocked but otherwise left unharmed. The Kentish rebels reached Blackheath, just south-east of the capital, on 12 June.\nWord of the revolt reached the King at Windsor Castle on the night of 10 June. He travelled by boat down the River Thames to London the next day, taking up residence in the powerful fortress of the Tower of London for safety, where he was joined by his mother, Archbishop Sudbury, the Lord High Treasurer Sir Robert Hales, the Earls of Arundel, Salisbury and Warwick and several other senior nobles. A delegation, headed by Thomas Brinton, the Bishop of Rochester, was sent out from London to negotiate with the rebels and persuade them to return home.\nAt Blackheath, John Ball gave a famous sermon to the assembled Kentishmen. Ball was a well-known priest and radical preacher from Kent, who was by now closely associated with Tyler. Chroniclers' accounts vary as to how he came to be involved in the revolt; he may have been released from Maidstone prison by the crowds, or might have been already at liberty when the revolt broke out. Ball rhetorically asked the crowds \"When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then a gentleman?\" and promoted the rebel slogan \"With King Richard and the true commons of England\". The phrases emphasised the rebel opposition to the continuation of serfdom and to the hierarchies of the Church and State that separated the subject from the King, while stressing that they were loyal to the monarchy and, unlike the King's advisers, were \"true\" to Richard. The rebels rejected proposals from the Bishop of Rochester that they should return home, and instead prepared to march on.\nDiscussions took place in the Tower of London about how to deal with the revolt. The King had only a few troops at hand, in the form of the castle's garrison, his immediate bodyguard and, at most, several hundred soldiers. Many of the more experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion. Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels and criminals, leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.\nSince the Blackheath negotiations had failed, the decision was taken that the King himself should meet the rebels, at Greenwich, on the south side of the Thames. Guarded by four barges of soldiers, Richard sailed from the Tower on the morning of 13 June, where he was met on the other side by the rebel crowds. The negotiations failed, as Richard was unwilling to come ashore and the rebels refused to enter discussions until he did. Richard returned across the river to the Tower.\nEvents in London.\nEntry to the city.\nThe rebels began to cross from Southwark onto London Bridge on the afternoon of 13 June. The defences on London Bridge were opened from the inside, either in sympathy for the rebel cause or out of fear, and the rebels advanced into the city. At the same time, the rebel force from Essex made its way towards Aldgate on the north side of the city. The rebels swept west through the centre of the city, and Aldgate was opened to let the rest of the rebels in.\nThe Kentish rebels had assembled a wide-ranging list of people whom they wanted the King to hand over for execution. It included national figures, such as John of Gaunt, Archbishop Sudbury and Hales; other key members of the royal council; officials, such as Belknap and Bampton who had intervened in Kent; and other hated members of the wider royal circle. When they reached the Marshalsea Prison in Southwark, they tore it apart. By now the Kent and Essex rebels had been joined by many rebellious Londoners. The Fleet and Newgate Prisons were attacked by the crowds, and the rebels also targeted houses belonging to Flemish immigrants.\nOn the north side of London, the rebels approached Smithfield and Clerkenwell Priory, the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller which was headed by Hales. The priory was destroyed, along with the nearby manor. Heading west along Fleet Street, the rebels attacked the Temple, a complex of legal buildings and offices owned by the Hospitallers. The contents, books and paperwork were brought out and burned in the street, and the buildings systematically demolished. Meanwhile, John Fordham, the Keeper of the Privy Seal and one of the men on the rebels' execution list, narrowly escaped when the crowds ransacked his accommodation but failed to notice he was still in the building.\nNext to be attacked along Fleet Street was the Savoy Palace, a huge, luxurious building belonging to John of Gaunt. According to the chronicler Henry Knighton it contained \"such quantities of vessels and silver plate, without counting the parcel-gilt and solid gold, that five carts would hardly suffice to carry them\"; official estimates placed the value of the contents at around \u00a310,000. The interior was systematically destroyed by the rebels, who burnt the soft furnishings, smashed the precious metal work, crushed the gems, set fire to the Duke's records and threw the remains into the Thames and the city drains. Almost nothing was stolen by the rebels, who declared themselves to be \"zealots for truth and justice, not thieves and robbers\". The remains of the building were then set alight. In the evening, rebel forces gathered outside the Tower of London, from where the King watched the fires burning across the city.\nTaking the Tower of London.\nOn the morning of 14 June, the crowd continued west along the Thames, burning the houses of officials around Westminster and opening the Westminster prison. They then moved back into central London, setting fire to more buildings and storming Newgate Prison. The hunt for Flemings continued, and those with Flemish-sounding accents were killed, including the royal adviser, Richard Lyons. In one city ward, the bodies of 40 executed Flemings were piled up in the street, and at the Church of St Martin Vintry, popular with the Flemish, 35 of the community were killed. Historian Rodney Hilton argues that these attacks may have been coordinated by the weavers' guilds of London, who were commercial competitors of the Flemish weavers.\nIsolated inside the Tower, the royal government was in a state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.\nIt is uncertain who spoke for the rebels at Mile End, and Wat Tyler may not have been present on this occasion, but they appear to have put forward their various demands to the King, including the surrender of the hated officials on their lists for execution; the abolition of serfdom and unfree tenure; \"that there should be no law within the realm save the law of Winchester\", and a general amnesty for the rebels. It is unclear precisely what was meant by the law of Winchester, but it probably referred to the rebel ideal of self-regulating village communities. Richard issued charters announcing the abolition of serfdom, which immediately began to be disseminated around the country. He declined to hand over any of his officials, apparently instead promising that he would personally implement any justice that was required.\nWhile Richard was at Mile End, the Tower was taken by the rebels. This force, separate from those operating under Tyler at Mile End, approached the castle, possibly in the late morning. The gates were open to receive Richard on his return and a crowd of around 400 rebels entered the fortress, encountering no resistance, possibly because the guards were terrified by them.\nOnce inside, the rebels began to hunt down their key targets, and found Archbishop Sudbury and Robert Hales in the chapel of the White Tower. Along with William Appleton, John of Gaunt's physician, and John Legge, a royal sergeant, they were taken out to Tower Hill and beheaded. Their heads were paraded around the city, before being affixed to London Bridge. The rebels found John of Gaunt's son, the future Henry IV, and were about to execute him as well, when John Ferrour, one of the royal guards, successfully interceded on his behalf. The rebels also discovered Lady Joan and Joan Holland, Richard's sister, in the castle but let them go unharmed after making fun of them. The castle was thoroughly looted of armour and royal paraphernalia.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Richard did not return to the Tower but instead travelled from Mile End to the Great Wardrobe, one of his royal houses in Blackfriars, part of south-west London. There he appointed the military commander Richard FitzAlan, the Earl of Arundel, to replace Sudbury as Chancellor, and began to make plans to regain an advantage over the rebels the following day. Many of the Essex rebels now began to disperse, content with the King's promises, leaving Tyler and the Kentish forces the most significant faction in London. Tyler's men moved around the city that evening, seeking out and killing John of Gaunt's employees, foreigners and anyone associated with the legal system.\nSmithfield.\nOn 15 June the royal government and the remaining rebels, who were unsatisfied with the charters granted the previous day, agreed to meet at Smithfield, just outside the city walls. London remained in confusion, with various bands of rebels roaming the city independently. Richard prayed at Westminster Abbey, before setting out for the meeting in the late afternoon. The chroniclers' accounts of the encounter all vary on matters of detail, but agree on the broad sequence of events. The King and his party, at least 200 strong and including men-at-arms, positioned themselves outside St Bartholomew's Priory to the east of Smithfield, and the thousands of rebels massed along the western end.\nRichard probably called Tyler forwards from the crowd to meet him, and Tyler greeted the King with what the royal party considered excessive familiarity, terming Richard his \"brother\" and promising him his friendship. Richard queried why Tyler and the rebels had not yet left London following the signing of the charters the previous day, but this brought an angry rebuke from Tyler, who requested that a further charter be drawn up. The rebel leader rudely demanded refreshment and, once this had been provided, attempted to leave.\nAn argument then broke out between Tyler and some of the royal servants. The Lord Mayor of London, William Walworth, stepped forward to intervene, Tyler made some motion towards the King, and the royal soldiers leapt in. Either Walworth or Richard ordered Tyler to be arrested, Tyler attempted to attack the Mayor, and Walworth responded by stabbing Tyler. Ralph Standish, a royal squire, then repeatedly stabbed Tyler with his sword, mortally injuring him.\nThe situation was now precarious and violence appeared likely as the rebels prepared to unleash a volley of arrows. Richard rode forward towards the crowd and persuaded them to follow him away from Smithfield, to Clerkenwell Fields, defusing the situation. Walworth meanwhile began to regain control of the situation, backed by reinforcements from the city. Tyler's head was cut off and displayed on a pole and, with their leader dead and the royal government now backed by the London militia, the rebel movement began to collapse. Richard promptly knighted Walworth and his leading supporters for their services.\nWider revolt.\nEastern England.\nWhile the revolt was unfolding in London, John Wrawe led his force into Suffolk. Wrawe had considerable influence over the development of the revolt across eastern England, where there may have been almost as many rebels as in the London revolt. The authorities put up very little resistance to the revolt: the major nobles failed to organise defences, key fortifications fell easily to the rebels and the local militias were not mobilised. As in London and the south-east, this was in part due to the absence of key military leaders and the nature of English law, but any locally recruited men might also have proved unreliable in the face of a popular uprising.\nOn 12 June, Wrawe attacked Sir Richard Lyons' property at Overhall, advancing on to Cavendish and Bury St Edmunds in west Suffolk the next day, gathering further support as they went. John Cambridge, the Prior of the wealthy Bury St Edmunds Abbey, was disliked in the town, and Wrawe allied himself with the townspeople and stormed the abbey. The Prior escaped, but was found two days later and beheaded. A small band of rebels marched north to Thetford to extort protection money from the town, and another group tracked down Sir John Cavendish, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. Cavendish was caught in Lakenheath and killed. John Battisford and Thomas Sampson independently led a revolt near Ipswich on 14 June. They took the town without opposition and looted the properties of the archdeacon and local tax officials. The violence spread out further, with attacks on many properties and the burning of the local court records. One official, Edmund Lakenheath, was forced to flee from the Suffolk coast by boat.\nRevolt began to stir in St Albans in Hertfordshire late on 13 June, when news broke of the events in London. There had been long-running disagreements in St Albans between the town and the local abbey, which had extensive privileges in the region. On 14 June, protesters met with the Abbot, Thomas de la Mare, and demanded their freedom from the abbey. A group of townsmen under the leadership of William Grindecobbe travelled to London, where they appealed to the King for the rights of the abbey to be abolished. Wat Tyler, then still in control of the city, granted them authority in the meantime to take direct action against the abbey. Grindecobbe and the rebels returned to St Albans, where they found the Prior had already fled. The rebels broke open the abbey prison, destroyed the fences marking out the abbey lands and burnt the abbey records in the town square. They then forced Thomas de la Mare to surrender the abbey's rights in a charter on 16 June. The revolt against the abbey spread out over the next few days, with abbey property and financial records being destroyed across the county.\nOn 15 June, a revolt broke out in Cambridgeshire, led by elements of Wrawe's Suffolk rebellion and some local men, such as John Greyston, who had been involved in the events in London and had returned to his home county to spread the revolt, and Geoffrey Cobbe and John Hanchach, members of the local gentry. The University of Cambridge, staffed by priests and enjoying special royal privileges, was widely hated by the other inhabitants of the town. A revolt backed by the Mayor of Cambridge broke out with the university as its main target. The rebels ransacked Corpus Christi College, which had connections to John of Gaunt, and the University's church, and attempted to execute the university bedel, who escaped. The university's library and archives were burnt in the centre of the town, with one Margery Starre leading the mob in a dance to the rallying cry \"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\" while the documents burned. The next day, the university was forced to negotiate a new charter, giving up its royal privileges. Unrest then spread north from Cambridge toward Ely, where the prison was opened and the local Justice of the Peace executed.\nIn Norfolk, the revolt was led by Geoffrey Litster, a weaver, and Sir Roger Bacon, a local lord with ties to the Suffolk rebels. Litster began sending out messengers across the county in a call to arms on 14 June, and isolated outbreaks of violence occurred. The rebels assembled on 17 June outside Norwich and killed Sir Robert Salle, who was in charge of the city defences and had attempted to negotiate a settlement. The people of the town then opened the gates to let the rebels in. They began looting buildings and killed Reginald Eccles, a local official. William de Ufford, the Earl of Suffolk fled his estates and travelled in disguise to London. The other leading members of the local gentry were captured and forced to play out the roles of a royal household, working for Litster. Violence spread out across the county, as prisons were opened, Flemish immigrants killed, court records burned, and property looted and destroyed.\nNorthern and western England.\nRevolts also occurred across the rest of England, particularly in the cities of the north, traditionally centres of political unrest. In the town of Beverley, violence broke out between the richer mercantile elite and the poorer townspeople during May. By the end of the month the rebels had taken power and replaced the former town administration with their own. The rebels attempted to enlist the support of Alexander Neville, the Archbishop of York, and in June forced the former town government to agree to arbitration through Neville. Peace was restored in June 1382 but tensions continued to simmer for many years.\nWord of the troubles in the south-east spread north, slowed by the poor communication links of medieval England. In Leicester, where John of Gaunt had a substantial castle, warnings arrived of a force of rebels advancing on the city from Lincolnshire, who were intent on destroying the castle and its contents. The mayor and the town mobilised their defences, including a local militia, but the rebels never arrived. John of Gaunt was in Berwick when word reached him on 17 June of the revolt. Not knowing that Wat Tyler had by now been killed, John of Gaunt placed his castles in Yorkshire and Wales on alert. Fresh rumours, many of them incorrect, continued to arrive in Berwick, suggesting widespread rebellions across the west and east of England and the looting of the ducal household in Leicester; rebel units were even said to be hunting for the Duke himself. Gaunt began to march to Bamburgh Castle, but then changed course and diverted north into Scotland, only returning south once the fighting was over.\nNews of the initial events in London also reached York around 17 June, and attacks at once broke out on the properties of the Dominican friars, the Franciscan friaries and other religious institutions. Violence continued over the coming weeks, and on 1 July a group of armed men, under the command of John de Gisbourne, forced their way into the city and attempted to seize control. The mayor, Simon de Quixlay, gradually began to reclaim authority, but order was not properly restored until 1382. The news of the southern revolt reached Scarborough where riots broke out against the ruling elite on 23 June, with the rebels dressed in white hoods with a red tail at the back. Members of the local government were deposed from office, and one tax collector was nearly lynched. By 1382 the elite had re-established power.\nIn the Somerset town of Bridgwater, revolt broke out on 19 June, led by Thomas Ingleby and Adam Brugge. The crowds attacked the local Augustine house and forced their master to give up his local privileges and pay a ransom. The rebels then turned on the properties of John Sydenham, a local merchant and official, looting his manor and burning paperwork, before executing Walter Baron, a local man. The Ilchester prison was stormed, and one unpopular prisoner executed.\nSuppression.\nThe royal suppression of the revolt began shortly after the death of Wat Tyler on 15 June. Sir Robert Knolles, Sir Nicholas Brembre and Sir Robert Launde were appointed to restore control in the capital. A summons was put out for soldiers, probably around 4,000 men were mustered in London, and expeditions to the other troubled parts of the country soon followed.\nThe revolt in East Anglia was independently suppressed by Henry Despenser, the Bishop of Norwich. Henry was in Stamford in Lincolnshire when the revolt broke out, and when he found out about it he marched south with eight men-at-arms and a small force of archers, gathering more forces as he went. He marched first to Peterborough, where he routed the local rebels and executed any he could capture, including some who had taken shelter in the local abbey. He then headed south-east via Huntingdon and Ely, reached Cambridge on 19 June, and then headed further into the rebel-controlled areas of Norfolk. Henry reclaimed Norwich on 24 June, before heading out with a company of men to track down the rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster. The two forces met at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June; the Bishop's forces triumphed and Litster was captured and executed. Henry's quick action was essential to the suppression of the revolt in East Anglia, but he was very unusual in taking matters into his own hands in this way, and his execution of the rebels without royal sanction was illegal.\nOn 17 June, the King dispatched his half-brother Thomas Holland and Sir Thomas Trivet to Kent with a small force to restore order. They held courts at Maidstone and Rochester. William de Ufford, the Earl of Suffolk, returned to his county on 23 June, accompanied by a force of 500 men. He quickly subdued the area and was soon holding court in Mildenhall, where many of the accused were sentenced to death. He moved on into Norfolk on 6 July, holding court in Norwich, Great Yarmouth and Hacking. Hugh, Lord la Zouche, led the legal proceedings against the rebels in Cambridgeshire. In St Albans, the Abbot arrested William Grindecobbe and his main supporters.\nOn 20 June, the King's uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, and Robert Tresilian, the replacement Chief Justice, were given special commissions across the whole of England. Thomas oversaw court cases in Essex, backed up by a substantial military force as resistance was continuing and the county was still in a state of unrest. Richard himself visited Essex, where he met with a rebel delegation seeking confirmation of the grants the King had given at Mile End. Richard rejected them, allegedly telling them that \"rustics you were and rustics you are still. You will remain in bondage, not as before, but incomparably harsher\". Tresilian soon joined Thomas, and carried out 31 executions in Chelmsford, then travelled to St Albans in July for further court trials, which appear to have utilised dubious techniques to ensure convictions. Thomas went on to Gloucester with 200 soldiers to suppress the unrest there. Henry Percy, the Earl of Northumberland, was tasked to restore order to Yorkshire.\nA wide range of laws were invoked in the process of the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or demolishing houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.\nThe rebel leaders were quickly rounded up. A rebel leader by the name of Jack Straw was captured in London and executed. John Ball was caught in Coventry, tried in St Albans, and executed on 15 July. Grindecobbe was also tried and executed in St Albans. John Wrawe was tried in London; he probably gave evidence against 24 of his colleagues in the hope of a pardon, but was sentenced to be executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered on 6 May 1382. Sir Roger Bacon was probably arrested before the final battle in Norfolk, and was tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London before finally being pardoned by the Crown. As of September 1381, Thomas Ingleby of Bridgwater had successfully evaded the authorities.\nAlthough women such as Johanna Ferrour played a prominent role in the revolt, no evidence has been found of women being executed or punished as harshly as their male counterparts.\nAftermath.\nThe royal government and Parliament began to re-establish the normal processes of government after the revolt; as the historian Michael Postan describes, the uprising was in many ways a \"passing episode\". On 30 June, the King ordered England's serfs to return to their previous conditions of service, and on 2 July the royal charters signed under duress during the rising were formally revoked. Parliament met in November to discuss the events of the year and how best to respond to their challenges. The revolt was blamed on the misconduct of royal officials, who, it was argued, had been excessively greedy and overbearing. The Commons stood behind the existing labour laws, but requested changes in the royal council, which Richard granted. Richard also granted general pardons to those who had executed rebels without due process, to all men who had remained loyal, and to all those who had rebelled\u00a0\u2013 with the exception of the men of Bury St Edmunds, any men who had been involved in the killing of the King's advisers, and those who were still on the run from prison.\nDespite the violence of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.\nThere were no further attempts by Parliament to impose a poll tax or to reform England's fiscal system. The Commons instead concluded at the end of 1381 that the military effort on the Continent should be \"carefully but substantially reduced\". Unable to raise fresh taxes, the government had to curtail its foreign policy and military expeditions and began to examine the options for peace. The institution of serfdom declined after 1381, but primarily for economic rather than political reasons. Rural wages continued to increase, and lords increasingly sold their serfs' freedom in exchange for cash, or converted traditional forms of tenure to new leasehold arrangements. During the 15th century serfdom vanished in England.\nRebels.\nChroniclers primarily described the rebels as rural serfs, using broad, derogatory Latin terms such as \"serviles rustici\", \"servile genus\" and \"rusticitas\". Some chroniclers, including Knighton, also noted the presence of runaway apprentices, artisans and others, sometimes terming them the \"lesser commons\". The evidence from the court records following the revolt, albeit biased in various ways, similarly shows the involvement of a much broader community, and the earlier perception that the rebels were only constituted of unfree serfs is now rejected.\nThe rural rebels came from a wide range of backgrounds, but typically they were, as the historian Christopher Dyer describes, \"people well below the ranks of the gentry, but who mainly held some land and goods\", and not the very poorest in society, who formed a minority of the rebel movement. Many had held positions of authority in local village governance, and these seem to have provided leadership to the revolt. Some were artisans, including, as the historian Rodney Hilton lists, \"carpenters, sawyers, masons, cobblers, tailors, weavers, fullers, glovers, hosiers, skinners, bakers, butchers, innkeepers, cooks and a lime-burner\". They were predominantly male, but with some women in their ranks. The rebels were typically illiterate; only between 5 and 15 per cent of England could read during this period. They also came from a broad range of local communities, including at least 330 south-eastern villages.\nMany of the rebels had urban backgrounds, and the majority of those involved in the events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants. In some cases, the townsfolk who joined the revolt were the urban poor, attempting to gain at the expense of the local elites. In London, for example, the urban rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled. Other urban rebels were part of the elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds. In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between urban and rural less meaningful. With the Peasants\u2019 Revolt marking the revolution of the freedom fight, labour had become so expensive that the feudal system was ultimately coming to an end. The rebels of the Peasants\u2019 Revolt were represented by various writers since they did not represent themselves in historical records. The distortion of written records implied that these rebels were illiterate, or otherwise incoherent. Some of these distortions made by countless authors were also interpretative and favored their own positions, making the job of historians more difficult as they try to uncover a more truthful representation of the rebels. Author and medievalist Steven Justice exemplifies that the rebels were, in fact, capable of speech and language at its most developed. Examples of this included cultural forms of expression such as rituals, performances, and literary texts.\nThe vast majority of those involved in the revolt of 1381 were not represented in Parliament and were excluded from its decision-making. In a few cases the rebels were led or joined by relatively prosperous members of the gentry, such as Sir Roger Bacon in Norfolk. Some of them later claimed to have been forced to join the revolt by the rebels. Clergy also formed part of the revolt; as well as the more prominent leaders, such as John Ball or John Wrawe, nearly 20 are mentioned in the records of the revolt in the south-east. Some were pursuing local grievances, some were disadvantaged and suffering relative poverty, and others appear to have been motivated by strong radical beliefs.\nMany of those involved in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.\nLegacy.\nHistoriography.\nContemporary chroniclers of the events in the revolt have formed an important source for historians. The chroniclers were biased against the rebel cause and typically portrayed the rebels, in the words of the historian Susan Crane, as \"beasts, monstrosities or misguided fools\". London chroniclers were also unwilling to admit the role of ordinary Londoners in the revolt, preferring to place the blame entirely on rural peasants from the south-east. Among the key accounts was the anonymous \"Anonimalle Chronicle\", whose author appears to have been part of the royal court and an eye-witness to many of the events in London. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham was present for much of the revolt, but focused his account on the terror of the social unrest and was extremely biased against the rebels. The events were recorded in France by Jean Froissart, the author of the \"Chronicles\". He had well-placed sources close to the revolt, but was inclined to elaborate the known facts with colourful stories. No sympathetic accounts of the rebels survive.\nFor four centuries, chroniclers and historians of the revolt were overwhelmingly negative, but attitudes started to change in the 18th century as serfdom was long rejected and in the aftermath of the radicalism associated with the French Revolution. At the end of the 19th century, there was a surge in historical interest in the Peasants' Revolt, spurred by the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements. Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, Andr\u00e9 R\u00e9ville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of the revolt. By 1907, the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified. R\u00e9ville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, and over the next century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.\nInterpretations of the revolt have changed over the years. Historians of the 17th century, such as John Smyth, established the idea that the revolt had marked the end of unfree labour and serfdom in England. Historians of the 19th century, such as William Stubbs and Thorold Rogers, reinforced this conclusion, Stubbs describing it as \"one of the most portentous events in the whole of our history\". In the 20th century, this interpretation was increasingly challenged by historians such as May McKisack, Michael Postan and Richard Dobson, who revised the impact of the revolt on further political and economic events in England. Mid-20th century Marxist historians were both interested in, and generally sympathetic to, the rebel cause, a trend culminating in Hilton's 1973 account of the uprising, set against the wider context of peasant revolts across Europe during the period. The Peasants' Revolt has received more academic attention than any other medieval revolt, and this research has been interdisciplinary, involving historians, literary scholars and international collaboration.\nA large slate memorial to \"The Great Rising\" was commissioned by Matthew Bell and carved by Emily Hoffnung. It was unveiled by the film director Ken Loach in Smithfield on 15 July 2015.\nPopular culture.\nThe Peasants' Revolt became a popular literary subject. The poet John Gower, who had close ties to officials involved in the suppression of the revolt, amended his famous poem \"Vox Clamantis\" after the revolt, inserting a section condemning the rebels and likening them to wild animals. Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived in Aldgate and may have been in London during the revolt, used the rebel killing of Flemings as a metaphor for wider disorder in \"The Nun's Priest's Tale\" part of \"The Canterbury Tales\", parodying Gower's poem. Although the Peasant's Revolt was only ever mentioned sparingly in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales,\" the Peasant's Revolt was one of the many historical incidents that occurred in Chaucer's life prior to his popular works. With other events such as The Black Death, the devastation that followed after the plague incited the peasants that survived to seek a better quality of life. Evidence of the impression that the revolt made on Chaucer can be seen in the Miller's Prologue of \"The Canterbury Tales.\" Chaucer portrays the Miller as someone who is not entirely satisfied with the typical idea of what a peasant is and how they should live, and he uses metaphors in order to make this implication in the Miller's Prologue. The notion that the Miller is able to tell a tale that can match, or is even better than one of the highest-ranking Knights in the pilgrimage shows the rebellion and persistence in bettering one's status, which is similar to what was seen in the attitudes of the peasants in their revolt. Chaucer otherwise made no reference to the revolt in his work, possibly because as he was a client of the King it would have been politically unwise to discuss it. William Langland, the author of the poem \"Piers Plowman\", which had been widely used by the rebels, made various changes to its text after the revolt in order to distance himself from their cause.\nThe revolt formed the basis for the late 16th-century play, \"The Life and Death of Jack Straw\", possibly written by George Peele and probably originally designed for production in the city's guild pageants. It portrays Jack Straw as a tragic figure, being led into wrongful rebellion by John Ball, making clear political links between the instability of late-Elizabethan England and the 14th century. The story of the revolt was used in pamphlets during the English Civil War of the 17th century, and formed part of John Cleveland's early history of the war. It was deployed as a cautionary account in political speeches during the 18th century, and a chapbook entitled \"The History of Wat Tyler and Jack Strawe\" proved popular during the Jacobite risings and American War of Independence. The historian James Crossley argues that after the French Revolution, the Peasants' Revolt was seen more positively, especially among radicals and revolutionaries. Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke argued over the lessons to be drawn from the revolt, Paine expressing sympathy for the rebels and Burke condemning the violence. The Romantic poet Robert Southey based his 1794 play \"Wat Tyler\" on the events, taking a radical and pro-rebel perspective.\nAs the historian Michael Postan describes, the revolt became famous \"as a landmark in social development and [as] a typical instance of working-class revolt against oppression\", and was widely used in 19th and 20th century socialist literature. William Morris built on Chaucer in his novel \"A Dream of John Ball\", published in 1888, creating a narrator who was openly sympathetic to the peasant cause, albeit a 19th-century persona taken back to the 14th century by a dream. The story ends with a prophecy that socialist ideals will one day be successful. In turn, this representation of the revolt influenced Morris's utopian socialist \"News from Nowhere\". Florence Converse used the revolt in her novel \"Long Will\" in 1903. Later 20th century socialists continued to draw parallels between the revolt and contemporary political struggles, including during the arguments over the introduction of the Community Charge in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.\nConspiracy theorists, including writer John Robinson, have attempted to explain alleged flaws in mainstream historical accounts of the events of 1381, such as the speed with which the rebellion was coordinated. Theories include that the revolt was led by a secret, occult organisation called \"the Great Society\", said to be an offshoot of the order of the Knights Templar destroyed in 1312, or that the fraternity of the Freemasons was covertly involved in organising the revolt.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "57174", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57174", "title": "Rib cage", "text": "Bone structure of the thorax\nThe rib cage or thoracic cage is an endoskeletal enclosure in the thorax of most vertebrates that comprises the ribs, vertebral column and sternum, which protect the vital organs of the thoracic cavity, such as the heart, lungs and great vessels and support the shoulder girdle to form the core part of the axial skeleton.\nA typical human thoracic cage consists of 12 pairs of ribs and the adjoining costal cartilages, the sternum (along with the manubrium and xiphoid process), and the 12 thoracic vertebrae articulating with the ribs. The thoracic cage also provides attachments for extrinsic skeletal muscles of the neck, upper limbs, upper abdomen and back, and together with the overlying skin and associated fascia and muscles, makes up the thoracic wall.\nIn tetrapods, the rib cage intrinsically holds the muscles of respiration (diaphragm, intercostal muscles, etc.) that are crucial for active inhalation and forced exhalation, and therefore has a major ventilatory function in the respiratory system.\nStructure.\nThere are thirty-three vertebrae in the human vertebral column. The rib cage is associated with TH1\u2212TH12. Ribs are described based on their location and connection with the sternum. All ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly one to twelve. Ribs that articulate directly with the sternum are called \"true ribs\", whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed \"false ribs\". The \"false ribs\" include the \"floating ribs\" (eleven and twelve) that are not attached to the sternum at all.\nAttachment.\nThe terms \"true ribs\" and \"false ribs\" describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum respectively. The first seven rib pairs known as the \"fixed\" or \"vertebrosternal\" ribs are the \"true ribs\" () as they connect directly to the sternum via their own individual costal cartilages. The next five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the \"false ribs\" () or \"vertebrochondral\" ribs, which do not connect directly to the sternum. The first three pairs of vertebrochondral ribs (eighth to tenth) connect indirectly to the sternum via the costal cartilages of the ribs above them, and the overall elasticity of their articulations allows the bucket handle movements of the rib cage essential for respiratory activity.\nThe phrase \"floating rib\" () or \"vertebral\" rib refers to the two lowermost (the eleventh and twelfth) rib pairs; so-called because they are attached only to the vertebrae and not to the sternum or any of the costal cartilages. These ribs are relatively small and delicate, and include a cartilaginous tip.\nThe spaces between the ribs are known as intercostal spaces; they contain the instrinsic intercostal muscles and the neurovascular bundles containing intercostal nerves, arteries and veins. The superficial surface of the rib cage is covered by the thoracolumbar fascia, which provides external attachments for the neck, back, pectoral and abdominal muscles.\nParts of rib.\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft. All ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. They are numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top (T1) to bottom. The head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra with which it articulates. It is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. The upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above, and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra with the same number. The transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the same number. The crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.\nThe neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. The neck is about 3\u00a0cm long. Its anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give attachment to the ligament of the neck. Its upper border presents a rough crest (\"crista colli costae\") for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse ligament; its lower border is rounded.\nOn the posterior surface at the neck, is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular portion. The articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which the head is connected. The non-articular portion is a rough elevation and affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. The tubercle is much more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\nThe angle of a rib (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. This line is directed downward and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle. At this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted on its long axis.\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively greater from the second to the tenth ribs. The area between the angle and the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\nBones.\nRibs and vertebrae.\nThe first rib (the topmost one) is the most curved and usually the shortest of all the ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its borders inward and outward.\nThe \"head\" is small and rounded, and possesses only a single articular facet, for articulation with the body of the first thoracic vertebra. The \"neck\" is narrow and rounded. The \"tubercle\", thick and prominent, is placed on the outer border. It bears a small facet for articulation with the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T1. There is no \"angle\", but at the tubercle, the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward, so that the head of the bone is directed downward. The upper surface of the body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment of the anterior scalene; the \"anterior groove\" transmits the subclavian vein, the \"posterior \"the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus. Behind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the medial scalene. The \"under surface\" is smooth and without a costal groove. The \"outer border\" is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment to the first digitation of the serratus anterior. The \"inner border\" is concave, thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. The \"anterior extremity\" is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs.\nThe second rib is the second uppermost rib in humans or second most frontal in animals that walk on four limbs. In humans, the second rib is defined as a true rib since it connects with the sternum through the intervention of the costal cartilage anteriorly (at the front). Posteriorly, the second rib is connected with the vertebral column by the second thoracic vertebra. The second rib is much longer than the first rib, but has a very similar curvature. The non-articular portion of the tubercle is occasionally only feebly marked. The angle is slight and situated close to the tubercle. The body is not twisted so that both ends touch any plane surface upon which it may be laid; but there is a bend, with its convexity upward, similar to, though smaller than that found in the first rib. The body is not flattened horizontally like that of the first rib. Its external surface is convex, and looks upward and a little outward; near the middle of it is a rough eminence for the origin of the lower part of the first and the whole of the second digitation of the serratus anterior; behind and above this is attached the posterior scalene. The internal surface, smooth, and concave, is directed downward and a little inward: on its posterior part there is a short costal groove between the ridge of the internal surface of the rib and the inferior border. It protects the intercostal space containing the intercostal veins, intercostal arteries, and intercostal nerves.\nThe ninth rib has a frontal part at the same level as the first lumbar vertebra. This level is called the transpyloric plane, since the pylorus is also at this level.\nThe tenth rib attaches directly to the body of vertebra T10 instead of between vertebrae like the second through ninth ribs. Due to this direct attachment, vertebra T10 has a complete costal facet on its body.\nThe eleventh and twelfth ribs, the floating ribs, have a single articular facet on the head, which is of rather large size. They have no necks or tubercles, and are pointed at their anterior ends. The eleventh has a slight angle and a shallow costal groove, whereas the twelfth does not. The twelfth rib is much shorter than the eleventh rib, and only has a one articular facet.\nSternum.\nThe sternum is a long, flat bone that forms the front of the rib cage. The cartilages of the top seven ribs (the \"true ribs\") join with the sternum at the sternocostal joints. The costal cartilage of the second rib articulates with the sternum at the sternal angle making it easy to locate.\nThe manubrium is the wider, superior portion of the sternum. The top of the manubrium has a shallow, U-shaped border called the jugular (suprasternal) notch. The clavicular notch is the shallow depression located on either side at the superior-lateral margins of the manubrium. This is the site of the sternoclavicular joint, between the sternum and clavicle. The first ribs also attach to the manubrium.\nThe transversus thoracis muscle is innervated by one of the intercostal nerves and superiorly attaches at the posterior surface of the lower sternum. Its inferior attachment is the internal surface of costal cartilages two through six and works to depress the ribs.\nDevelopment.\nExpansion of the rib cage in males is caused by the effects of testosterone during puberty. Thus, males generally have broad shoulders and expanded chests, allowing them to inhale more air to supply their muscles with oxygen.\nThe development of the rib cage is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, as well as specific stages of embryonic growth. Genetic factors play a critical role, with specific genes regulating the formation of bones and cartilage to ensure the proper development and alignment of the ribs and sternum. During the embryonic stage, the rib cage begins to form from the mesoderm, one of the three primary germ layers. Ribs develop from structures called somites, which later segment into vertebrae and ribs. Initially, the ribs are composed of cartilage, which gradually ossifies into bone through a process known as endochondral ossification.\nAs the embryo grows, the ribs elongate and differentiate into three types: true ribs, which attach directly to the sternum; false ribs, which connect to the sternum via cartilage; and floating ribs, which do not attach to the sternum. Additionally, environmental factors such as maternal health, nutrition, and exposure to certain substances can impact rib cage development. For instance, deficiencies in essential nutrients like calcium and vitamin D may hinder proper bone growth and development. Together, these genetic, developmental, and environmental influences ensure the formation of a functional rib cage.\nVariation.\nVariations in the number of ribs occur. About 1 in 200\u2013500 people have an additional cervical rib, and there is a female predominance. Intrathoracic supernumerary ribs are extremely rare. The rib remnant of the 7th cervical vertebra on one or both sides is occasionally replaced by a free extra rib called a cervical rib, which can mechanically interfere with the nerves (brachial plexus) going to the arm.\nIn several ethnic groups, most significantly the Japanese, the tenth rib is sometimes a floating rib, as it lacks a cartilaginous connection to the seventh rib.\nFunction.\nThe human rib cage is a component of the human respiratory system. It encloses the thoracic cavity, which contains the lungs. An inhalation is accomplished when the muscular diaphragm, at the floor of the thoracic cavity, contracts and flattens, while the contraction of intercostal muscles lift the rib cage up and out.\nExpansion of the thoracic cavity is driven in three planes; the vertical, the anteroposterior and the transverse. The vertical plane is extended by the help of the diaphragm contracting and the abdominal muscles relaxing to accommodate the downward pressure that is supplied to the abdominal viscera by the diaphragm contracting. A greater extension can be achieved by the diaphragm itself moving down, rather than simply the domes flattening. The second plane is the anteroposterior and this is expanded by a movement known as the 'pump handle'. The downward sloping nature of the upper ribs are as such because they enable this to occur. When the external intercostal muscles contract and lift the ribs, the upper ribs are able also to push the sternum up and out. This movement increases the anteroposterior diameter of the thoracic cavity, and hence aids breathing further. The third, transverse, plane is primarily expanded by the lower ribs (some say it is the 7th to 10th ribs in particular), with the diaphragm's central tendon acting as a fixed point. When the diaphragm contracts, the ribs are able to evert (meaning turn outwards or inside out) and produce what is known as the bucket handle movement, facilitated by gliding at the costovertebral joints. In this way, the transverse diameter is expanded and the lungs can fill.\nThe circumference of the normal adult human rib cage expands by 3 to 5\u00a0cm during inhalation.\nClinical significance.\nRib fractures are the most common injury to the rib cage. These most frequently affect the middle ribs. When several adjacent ribs incur two or more fractures each, this can result in a flail chest which is a life-threatening condition.\nA dislocated rib can be painful and can be caused simply by coughing, or for example by trauma or lifting heavy weights.\nOne or more costal cartilages can become inflamed \u2013 a condition known as costochondritis; the resulting pain is similar to that of a heart attack.\nAbnormalities of the rib cage include pectus excavatum (\"sunken chest\") and pectus carinatum (\"pigeon chest\"). A bifid rib is a bifurcated rib, split towards the sternal end, and usually just affecting one of the ribs of a pair. It is a congenital defect affecting about 1.2% of the population. It is often without symptoms though respiratory difficulties and other problems can arise.\nRib removal is the surgical removal of one or more ribs for therapeutic or cosmetic reasons.\nRib resection is the removal of part of a rib.\nRegeneration.\nThe ability of the human rib to regenerate itself has been appreciated for some time. However, the repair has only been described in a few case reports. The phenomenon has been appreciated particularly by craniofacial surgeons, who use both cartilage and bone material from the rib for ear, jaw, face, and skull reconstruction.\nThe perichondrium and periosteum are fibrous sheaths of vascular connective tissue surrounding the rib cartilage and bone respectively. These tissues containing a source of progenitor stem cells that drive regeneration.\nSociety and culture.\nThe position of ribs can be permanently altered by a form of body modification called tightlacing, which uses a corset to compress and move the ribs.\nThe ribs, particularly their sternal ends, are used as a way of estimating age in forensic pathology due to their progressive ossification.\nBiblical story.\nThe number of ribs as 24 (12 pairs) was noted by the Flemish anatomist Vesalius in his key work of anatomy \"De humani corporis fabrica\" in 1543, setting off a wave of controversy, as it was traditionally assumed from the Biblical story of Adam and Eve that men's ribs would number one fewer than women's. However, thirteenth or \"cervical ribs\" occur in 1% of humans and this is more common in females than in males.\nOther animals.\nIn herpetology, costal grooves refer to lateral indents along the integument of salamanders. The grooves run between the axilla to the groin. Each groove overlies the myotomal septa to mark the position of the internal rib.\nBirds and reptiles have bony uncinate processes on their ribs that project caudally from the vertical section of each rib. These serve to attach sacral muscles and also aid in allowing greater inspiration. Crocodiles have cartilaginous uncinate processes.\nNotes.\n \"This article incorporates text in the public domain from the 20th edition of\" Gray's Anatomy \"(1918)\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is approximately (sticks) and (rope). A person who has practiced using this weapon is referred to in Japanese as .\nThe nunchaku is most widely used in Southern Chinese Kung fu, Okinawan Kobudo and karate. It is intended to be used as a training weapon, since practicing with it enables the development of quick hand movements and improves posture. Modern nunchaku may be made of metal, plastic, or fiberglass instead of the traditional wood. Toy versions and replicas not intended to be used as weapons may be made of polystyrene foam or plastic. Possession of this weapon is illegal in some countries, except for use in professional martial arts schools.\nThe origin of the nunchaku is unclear. One traditional explanation holds that it was originally invented by Emperor Taizu of Song, as a weapon utilised in war, initially named Grand Ancestor Coiling Dragon Staff (\u5927\u5c0f\u76e4\u9f8d\u68cd/\u592a\u7956\u76e4\u9f8d\u68cd, taai3 zo2 pun4 lung4 gwan3/taai3 zo2 pun4 lung4 gwan3). Another weapon, called the tabak-toyok, native to the northern Philippines, is constructed very similarly, suggesting that it and the nunchaku descended from the same instrument.\nIn modern times, the nunchaku and the tabak-toyok were popularized by the actor and martial artist Bruce Lee and by Dan Inosanto. Lee famously used nunchaku in several scenes in the 1972 film \"Fist of Fury\". When Tadashi Yamashita worked with Bruce Lee on the 1973 film \"Enter the Dragon,\" he enabled Lee to further explore the use of the nunchaku and other kobudo disciplines. The nunchaku is also the signature weapon of the character Michelangelo in the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" franchise.\nIn addition, the nunchaku is used in certain contact sports.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the Ryukyuan word likely originated from the Min Chinese word of \"nng chat kun\"(\u5169\u7bc0\u68cd). Another name for this weapon is \"n\u016bchiku\" ().\nIn the English language, \"nunchaku\" are often referred to as \"nunchucks\". It is a variant of a word from the Okinawan language, which itself may come from a Min Chinese word for a farming tool, neng-cak.\nOrigins.\nThe first written record of nunchaku-like weapon was the Chinese military compendium of compiled during the Northern Song dynasty\":\" \"\u9435\u93c8\u593e\u68d2\uff0c\u672c\u51fa\u897f\u620e\uff0c\u99ac\u4e0a\u7528\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6575\u6f22\u4e4b\u6b65\u5175\u3002\u5176\u72c0\u5982\u8fb2\u5bb6\u6253\u9ea5\u4e4b\u67b7\uff0c\u4ee5\u9435\u98fe\u4e4b\uff0c\u5229\u65bc\u81ea\u4e0a\u64ca\u4e0b\uff0c\u6545\u6f22\u5175\u5584\u7528\u8005\u5de7\u65bc\u620e\u4eba\u3002\"\nTranslation:\n\"Two sticks connected by metal chain, originated from Xirong, used on horses in combat against Han infantry, shaped similarly to flails used by farmers to thresh wheat, iron-decorated, easy to strike below from above, Han soldiers who were able to master could exercise with excellence against the Xirongs.\"One popular belief is that nunchaku in its contemporary form was originally a short South-East Asian flail. A near variant to the nunchaku called tabak-toyok exists in the northern Philippines, which was used to thresh rice or soybeans. Alternative theories are that it was originally developed from an Okinawan horse bit (\"muge\") or from a wooden clapper called \"hyoshiki\" carried by the village night watch, made of two blocks of wood joined by a cord. The night watch would hit the blocks of wood together to attract people's attention, then warn them about fires and other dangers.\nAn oft-repeated claim is that the nunchaku and other Okinawan weapons were tools adapted for use as weapons by peasants who were forbidden from possessing conventional weapons, but available academic sources suggest this is likely a romantic exaggeration created by 20th century martial arts schools. Martial arts in Okinawa were practiced exclusively by the aristocracy (\"kazoku\") and \"serving nobles\" (\"shizoku\"), but were prohibited among commoners (\"heimin\").\nConstruction.\nNunchaku consist of two sections of wood connected by a cord or chain, though variants may include additional sections of wood and chain. In China, the striking stick is called \"dragon stick\" (\"\u9f8d\u68cd\"), while the handle is called \"yang stick\" (\"\u967d\u68cd\").\nThe rounded nunchaku is comparatively heavy and used for training, whereas the octagonal nunchaku is used for combat. Ideally, each piece should be long enough to protect the forearm when held in a high grip near the top of the shaft. Both ends are usually of equal length, although asymmetrical nunchaku exist that are closer to a traditional flail.\nThe ideal length of the connecting rope or chain is just long enough to allow the user to lay it over his or her palm, with the sticks hanging comfortably and perpendicular to the ground. The weapon should be properly balanced in terms of weight. Cheaper or gimmicky nunchaku (such as glow-in-the-dark versions) are often not properly balanced, which prevents the performer from performing the more advanced and flashier \"low-grip\" moves, such as overhand twirls. The weight should be balanced towards the outer edges of the sticks for maximum ease and control of the swing arcs.\nTraditional nunchaku are made from a strong, flexible hardwood such as oak, loquat or pasania.\nFormal styles.\nThe nunchaku is most commonly used in Okinawan kobud\u014d and karate, but it is also used in Korean hapkido and Filipino eskrima. (More accurately, the Tabak-Toyok, a similar though distinct Philippine weapon, is used, not the Okinawan nunchaku). Its application is different in each style. The traditional Okinawan forms use the sticks primarily to grip and lock. Filipino martial artists use it much the same way they would wield a stick: striking is given precedence. Korean systems combine offensive and defensive moves, so both locks and strikes are taught. Other proprietary systems of Nunchaku are also used in Sembkalah (Iranian Monolingual Combat Style), which makes lethal blows in defense and assault.\nNunchaku is often the first weapon wielded by a student, to teach self-restraint and posture, as the weapon is liable to hit the wielder more than the opponent if not used properly.\nThe Nunchaku is usually wielded in one hand, but it can also be dual wielded. It can be whirled around, using its hardened handles for blunt force, as well as wrapping its chain around an attacking weapon to immobilize or disarm an opponent. Nunchaku training has been noted to increase hand speed, improve posture, and condition the hands of the practitioner. Therefore, it makes a useful training weapon.\nFreestyle.\nFreestyle nunchaku is a modern style of performance art using nunchaku as a visual tool, rather than as a weapon. With the growing prevalence of the Internet, the availability of nunchaku has greatly increased. In combination with the popularity of other video sharing sites, many people have become interested in learning how to use the weapons for freestyle displays. Freestyle is one discipline of competition held by the World Nunchaku Association. Some modern martial arts teach the use of nunchaku, as it may help students improve their reflexes, hand control, and other skills.\nLegality.\nIn a number of countries, possession of nunchaku is legally restricted, ranging from prohibiting carrying them concealed in public to outright banning any form of possession. Nearly all such regulations were created in the 1970s after a wave of popularity attributed to their appearances in the Bruce Lee martial arts films and related media. This popularity led to them being commonly found in the possession of delinquent youths and petty criminals. This combination of popular media exposure creating the impression of danger and lethality, and their perceived popularity with undesirable classes of society, led to legal restrictions being passed. Later legal challenges led to closer examination of nunchaku's actual use in criminal behavior, and have found most of these laws were likely not warranted. For example Judge Pamela Chan in 2018's \"Maloney v. Singas\" concluded \"there is virtually no evidence that nunchakus are associated with, or have been used to engage in, criminal conduct.\"\nIn Australia, a state or territory approval in a B709B form is required to lawfully import any nunchaku made of hard materials. They are classified as prohibited weapons in New South Wales.\nNorway, Canada, Russia, Poland, Chile, and Spain are all known to have significant restrictions.\nIn Germany, nunchaku have been illegal since April 2006, when they were declared a strangling weapon.\nIn England and Wales, public possession of nunchaku is heavily restricted by the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 and the Criminal Justice Act 1988. However, nunchaku are not included in the list of weapons whose sale and manufacture is prohibited by Schedule 1 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons) Order 1988 and are traded openly (subject to age restrictions).\nIn Scotland, laws restricting offensive weapons are similar to those of England and Wales. However, in a case in 2010, Glasgow Sheriff Court refused to accept a defence submission that nunchaku were not explicitly prohibited weapons under Scottish law, although the defendants were acquitted on other grounds.\nThe use of nunchaku was, in the 1980s and 1990s, censored from UK rebroadcasts of American children's TV shows such as \"ThunderCats\" and \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" cartoons and films. The UK version of \"ThunderCats\" edited out nunchaku used by the character Panthro. \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" needed to be edited, the nunchaku used by Michelangelo were edited, until they were replaced by a grappling hook. The UK version of the video game \"Soul Blade\" was also edited, replacing the character Li Long's nunchaku with a three-sectioned staff.\nIn Hong Kong, it is illegal to possess metal or wooden nunchaku connected by a chain, though one can obtain a license from the police as a martial arts instructor, and rubber nunchaku are still allowed. Possession of nunchaku in mainland China is legal.\nIn the United States, regulations on nunchaku vary by state as well as county and city jurisdictions. Some states do not apply any restrictions, while other state laws and local ordinances continue to prohibit carrying nunchaku in specific situations, such as on school grounds or in government facilities, or if carrying in public as a concealed weapon. Broader prohibitions were passed in the 1970s for the reasons outlined above, but many have since been repealed or overturned. State-level nunchaku bans on possession were initially passed in New York, Arizona, California, and Massachusetts, but only the Massachusetts ban remains:\nLaw enforcement use.\nNunchaku have been employed by a few American police departments for decades, especially after the popular Bruce Lee movies of the 1970's. For instance, in 2015, police in the small town of Anderson, California were trained and deployed to use nunchaku as a form of non-lethal force. They were selected because of their utility as both a striking weapon and a control tool.\nOrcutt Police Nunchaku (OPN) had been adopted by more than 200 law enforcement agencies in the USA. Even though it could be used as a striking weapon, it was mainly used as a grappling implement on the wrists and ankles for pain compliance. They were very effective in that regard but improper use had been associated with injuries like wrist and limb breaks that led to them being phased out.\nTASERs have become the preferred non-lethal weapon for most departments.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The United States federally recognized tribe is the Tohono O\u02bcodham Nation. The Ak-Chin Indian Community also has Tohono O\u02bcodham citizens.\nThe Tohono O\u02bcodham Nation governs the Tohono O\u02bcodham Indian Reservation, a major reservation located in southern Arizona. It encompasses portions of three counties: Pima, Pinal, and Maricopa in the United States. Tohono O\u02bcodham territory extends into the Mexican state of Sonora.\nName.\nThe Tohono O\u02bcodham tribal government and most of the people have rejected the common exonym \"Papago\" since the 1980s. They call themselves Tohono O\u02bcodham, meaning \"desert people\".\nThe Akimel O\u2019odham, a neighboring tribe, referred to them as \"Ba\ua789baw\u012dko\u02bca\", meaning \"eating tepary beans\". The Spanish colonizers learned that name from the Pima and transliterated it as \"P\u00e1pago\", in their pronunciation. Anglo settlers in the area adopted that term.\nHistory.\nThe historical lands of the Tohono O\u02bcodham stretched over much of what are now the jurisdictions of southern Arizona and Northern Mexico, across most of the Sonoran Desert. In the south, their land abutted against that of the Seris and Opata peoples. To the east, they ranged to at least the San Miguel River valley. The people may have migrated further east in seasonal travel. The Gila River represents the northern limits. To the west, their lands extended to the Colorado River and the Gulf of California. The frontiers of their territory would have been shared to an extent with neighboring tribes.\nThese lands are characterized by wide plains bordered by tall mountains. Water is scarce but is believed to have been more plentiful before European colonization. Their practices of cattle grazing and well drilling decreased stream flows. Localized natural springs provided water in some areas. In some areas, the people also relied on \"tinajas\", or potholes, that were filled with rainwater in the mountains. Rains are intensely seasonal in the Sonoran Desert, with much rainfall occurring in late summer monsoons. Monsoon storms are generally fierce and produce flooding. The remainder of rainfall generally falls in winter and is more gentle. Snows are extremely rare, and winters have a few days below freezing. The growing season is very long, up to 264 days in places. Summer temperatures are extreme, reaching up to for weeks at a time.\nThe Tohono O\u02bcodham migrated between summer and winter homes, usually moving to follow the water. They built their summer homes along alluvial plains, where they channeled summer rains onto fields they were cultivating. Some dikes and catchment basins were built, as was typical of Pima practices to the north. But most streams were not reliable enough for the people to build permanent canal systems. Winter villages were built in the mountains, to take advantage of more reliable water, and to enable the men to engage in hunting games.\nHistorically, the O\u02bcodham were enemies of the nomadic Apache from the late 17th until the beginning of the 20th century. The O\u02bcodham word for the Apache 'enemy' is \"ob.\" The O\u02bcodham were settled agricultural people who raised crops. According to their history, they knew the Apache would raid when they ran short on food, or hunting was bad.\nThe relationship between the O\u02bcodham and Apache was especially strained after 1871 when 92 O\u02bcodham joined Mexicans and Anglo-Americans and killed an estimated 144 Apache in the Camp Grant massacre. All but eight of the dead were women and children. The O\u02bcodham also captured 29 Apache children, whom they sold into slavery in Mexico. Conflict with European settlers encroaching on their lands eventually resulted in the O\u02bcodham and the Apache finding common interests.\nLittle of early O\u02bcodham history is known. That recorded by Europeans reflects their biases. The first European exploration and recording of O\u02bcodham lands was made in the early 1530s by \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca of the ill-fated Narv\u00e1ez expedition. Esteban the Moor passed through these lands, one of the four survivors of the Narvaez expedition. He returned later to lead Fray Marcos de Niza in an attempt to find the mythical Seven Cities of Gold. Esteban was killed by the Zuni when he dishonored their customs, and de Niza cut short his journey. De Niza wrote that the native cities were grander than Mexico City, which led to the Coronado expedition.\nConsiderable evidence suggests that, before the late 17th century, the O\u02bcodham and Apache were friendly and engaged in the exchange of goods and marriage partners. O\u02bcodham oral history, however, suggests that intermarriages resulted instead from raiding between the two tribes. It was typical for women and children to be taken captive in raids, to be used as slaves by the victors. Often women married into the tribe in which they were held captive and assimilated under duress. Both tribes thus incorporated \"enemies\" and their children into their cultures.\nThe San Xavier District is the site of Mission San Xavier del Bac, the \"White Dove of the Desert\". This is a major tourist attraction near Tucson. The mission was founded in 1700 by Jesuit missionary and explorer Eusebio Kino. Both the first and current church building were constructed by O\u02bcodham. The second building was constructed under direction of Franciscan priests, during a mission period from 1783 to 1797. The oldest European building in present-day Arizona, the mission is considered a premier example of Spanish colonial design. It is one of many missions built in the Southwest by the Spanish on what was then the northern frontier of their colony.\nTourists sometimes assume that the desert people had embraced the Catholicism of the Spanish conquistadors. Tohono O\u02bcodham villages resisted such change for hundreds of years. During the 1660s and in 1750s, two major rebellions rivaled in scale the 1680 Pueblo Rebellion. Their armed resistance prevented the Spanish from increasing their incursions into the lands of Pimer\u00eda Alta. The Spanish retreated to what they called \"Pimer\u00eda Baja\". As a result, the desert people preserved their traditions largely intact for generations.\nCulture.\nThe Tohono O\u02bcodham share linguistic and cultural roots with the closely related Akimel O\u02bcodham (People of the River), historically known as Pima, whose lands lie just south of present-day Phoenix, along the lower Gila River. The ancestors of both the Tohono O\u02bcodham and the Akimel O\u02bcodham resided along the major rivers of southern Arizona. Ancient pictographs adorn a rock wall that juts up out of the desert near the Baboquivari Mountains.\nOn the nature of the O\u02bcodham, Eric Winston writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The O\u02bcodham were not a people in a political sense. Instead, their sense of belonging came from similar traditions and ways of life, language and related legends, and experiences shared in surviving in a beautiful but not entirely hospitable land.\nDebates surround the origins of the O\u02bcodham. compete with claims that the Hohokam, who left the Casa Grande Ruins, are their ancestors.\nIn the Santa Barbara Mission Archive-Library are materials collected by a Franciscan friar who worked among the Tohono O\u02bcodham. These include scholarly volumes and monographs. The Office of Ethnohistorical Research, located at the Arizona State Museum on the campus of the University of Arizona, has undertaken a documentary history of the O\u02bcodham, offering translated colonial documents that discuss Spanish relations with the O\u02bcodham in the 17th and 18th centuries.\nO\u02bcodham musical and dance activities lack \"grand ritual paraphernalia that call for attention\" and grand ceremonies such as pow-wows. Instead, they wear muted white clay. O\u02bcodham songs are accompanied by hard wood rasps and drumming on overturned baskets, both of which lack resonance and are \"swallowed by the desert floor\". Dancing features skipping and shuffling quietly in bare feet on dry dirt, the dust raised being believed to rise to atmosphere and assist in forming rain clouds.\nSociety.\nSociety focused on the family, and each member had specific roles to play. Women were in charge of food preparation and also gathered the bulk of food, although all members helped. Older girls in the family would be in charge of fetching water each morning, the duty would fall to the wife if there were no daughters. Women also wove baskets, and made pottery, such as \"ollas\". Men performed many of the farming tasks, and hunted. Older men would hunt larger game like bighorn sheep, younger men and boys hunted small game. Most communities had a medicine man, a usually male position. Decisions were made by men in a communal fashion, with elders holding prominence. Children were free to play until age six, around which time they began to learn their roles. Grandparents and older siblings were the most frequent teachers, as parents tended to be very busy.\nMarriages were generally arranged by parents, or if the parents had died, older siblings. Since individual villages tended to be closely related, marriages were generally between villages, as close relatives were not allowed to marry. A wife would generally move to the village of her husband, but exceptions could be made if the wife's village needed more help. Polygamy was allowed. Although women had little choice in whom they married, they could choose to leave their marriage if unhappy; they would then return to their village and a new marriage would be arranged.\nSociety was intensely communal, and there were few positions of authority. Hunters shared their catches with the entire village. Food and supplies were shared with those who needed it. It was expected that if you had been given things in a time of need that you would repay the debt when you could.\nDespite a shared language and heritage, the O\u02bcodham were only loosely connected across their lands. Loyalty laid with the village, not the people. However, the O\u02bcodham generally got along well with neighbors. They regularly gathered with nearby villages, and would even partner with them in times of conflict against outsider tribes. Gatherings for races, trade, socialization, and gossip were frequent events. Gambling was a common recreational event, with men playing a game with sticks similar to dice, and women playing a game which required tossing painted sticks. They would bet trinkets such as shells or beads, as well as valuables such as blankets and mats. Betting also occurred on races, which were the most important sport. Girls were already generally good runners due to being water fetchers, and all members needed to be able to run to escape danger or attacks. Day long races were popular events, and courses would be . Women played a field hockey-like game called \"toka\" which is still enjoyed and is a frequent school sport on the modern reservation.\nSubgroups.\nThough they shared a linguistic root with the Pima, and could understand the languages of nearby tribes, such tribes were considered distant cousins at best. Even within the O\u02bcodham there were linguistic and cultural differences that led to the groups being only loosely united. Different groups had different origin stories, linguistic quirks, and appearances. Where a person lived was the best indicator of which group they belonged to, more so than the other differences. As of the 1700s, when Europeans began to categorize the tribes, there were probably at least six groups. The actual number of groups has varied by author. The following categorization is from Eric Winston's 1994 textbook on the O\u02bcodham, and includes seven groups, along with some subgroups.\nWarfare.\nThe O\u02bcodham were a generally peaceful people. They rarely, if ever, initiated conflict, and got along well with most neighboring tribes. The exception was the Apache, who were frequent raiders of the O\u02bcodham and other tribes. The Apache were to the east and northeast of the O\u02bcodham, and had probably moved into the area sometime in the 15th century. The Apache had limited interest in farming, and preferred to raid neighboring troops for supplies. The eastern O\u02bcodham, the Sobapuris, bore the brunt of Apache attacks.\nDiet.\nThe original O\u02bcodham diet consisted of regionally available wild game, insects, and plants. Through foraging, O\u02bcodham ate a variety of regional plants, such as: ironwood seed, honey mesquite, hog potato, and organ-pipe cactus fruit. While the Southwestern United States does not have an ideal climate for cultivating crops, O\u02bcodham cultivated crops of white tepary beans, peas, and Spanish watermelons. They hunted pronghorn antelope, gathered hornworm larvae, and trapped pack rats for sources of meat. Preparation of foods included steaming plants in pits and roasting meat on an open fire.\nSaguaro cactus fruit was an especially important food. The Tohono O\u02bcodham use long sticks to harvest the fruits, which are then made into a variety of products including jams, syrups, and ceremonial wine. Tohono O\u02bcodham cooks made porridge from its edible seeds. The harvest begins in June; villages would travel to the saguaro stands for the duration of the harvest. A pair of saguaro ribs, about long, is bundled together to make a harvesting tool called a \"kuibit\". They then reduce the freshly harvested fruit into a thick syrup through several hours of boiling, as the fresh fruit does not keep for long. of fruit will yield about of syrup. Copious volumes of fruit are harvested; an example harvest in 1929 yielded among 600 families. At the end of the harvest, each family would contribute a small amount of syrup to a communal stock that would be fermented by the medicine man. This was cause for rainmaking celebrations. Stories would be told, there was much dancing, and songs would be sung. Each man would drink some of the saguaro wine. The resulting intoxicated state was seen as holy, and any dreams it brought on were considered portentous. This was the only time that the O\u02bcodham drank alcohol during the year.\n\"Ak cin\", known as \"mouth of the wash\", refers to the farming method in which farmers would monitor the weather for signs of storm cloud formations. The appearance of storm clouds signified that there was going to be a downpour of rain. Farmers would anticipate these moments and quickly prep their plantations for seeding as the rain began to flood their lands. This type of agriculture was most commonly used during summer monsoons. Mission Garden in Tucson, Arizona, includes O\u02bcodham areas that show foods and farming methods before and after European contact. This includes planting in basins that hold the monsoon rains.\nTraditional tribal foods were a combination of goods provided by nature and items they cultivated. From nature, the Tohono O\u02bcodham would consume rabbit, sap and flour from mesquite trees (flour was made by crushing the pods of the trees), cholla cactus, and acorns. On the agricultural side of their diet, farmers focused on corn, squash, and tepary beans.\nLost traditions, modern times.\nIt was not until more numerous Americans of Anglo-European ancestry began moving into the Arizona territory that the outsiders began to oppress the people's traditional ways. Unlike many tribes in the United States, the Tohono O\u02bcodham never signed a treaty with the federal government, but the O\u02bcodham experienced challenges common to other nations.\nAs O\u02bcodham communal lands were allocated to households and some \"surplus\" sold to non-Native Americans under the Dawes Act of 1888, a variety of religious groups entered the territory. Presbyterian missionaries built schools and missions there, vying with Roman Catholics and Mormons to convert the O\u02bcodham to their faith.\nMajor farmers established the cotton industry, initially employing many O\u02bcodham as agricultural workers. Under the U.S. federal Indian policy of the late 19th and early 20th century, the government required native children to attend Indian boarding schools. They were forced to use English, practice Christianity, and give up much of their tribal cultures in an attempt by the government to assimilate the children of various tribes into the American mainstream.\nThe current tribal government, established in the 1930s under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, reflects years of commercial, missionary, and federal intervention. While the federal government encouraged tribes to reestablish their governments, it approved models based on the electoral system and structure of the US. The goal was to make the Indians into \"real\" Americans, but the boarding schools generally offered training only for low-level domestic and agricultural labor, typical of jobs available in rural areas. \"Assimilation\" was the official policy, but full participation was not the goal. Boarding school students were supposed to function within the segregated society of the United States as economic laborers, not leaders.\nThe Tohono O\u02bcodham have retained many traditions into the twenty-first century, and still speak their language. Since the late 20th century, however, U.S. mass culture has penetrated and in some cases eroded O\u02bcodham traditions as their children adopt new trends in technology and other practices.\nHealth.\nBeginning in the 1960s, government intervention in the tribe's agricultural cultivation caused the Tohono O\u02bcodham tribal citizens to shift from a traditional plant-based diet to one that favored foods high in fat and calories. The government began to close off the tribe's water source, preventing the Indigenous group from being able to produce traditional crops. This resulted in the widespread trend of type 2 diabetes among citizens of the tribe. The adaptation of a processed food diet caused the presence of type 2 diabetes to rise at alarming rates, with nearly 60 percent of the adult population in the tribe facing this disease and 75 percent of children expected to contract this disease in their lifetime. Children are also at risk for childhood obesity.\nMany of the original crops that the Indigenous group produced, such as tepary beans, squash, and the buds of cholla cactus, were items that could have aided in combating the diabetes crisis within the community. These foods possessed nutrients that would have helped normalize blood sugar and minimize the impact of diabetes. However, as a result of government intervention, many of these traditional foods were lost. A local nonprofit, Tohono O\u02bcodham Community Action (TOCA), has built a set of food systems programs that contribute to public health, cultural revitalization, and economic development. It has started a cafe that serves traditional foods.\nThe Tohono O\u02bcodham community has made efforts to combat future issues by attempting to rehabilitate the systems the tribe had in place before government intervention. The Indigenous group has been advocating for the restoration of their water privileges so that they will be able to effectively produce traditional crops for the tribe. Moreover, even in tribal schools, such as those in the local Baboquivari Unified School District, the quality of lunch programs is being reassessed in order to bring a larger emphasis of the need for healthier food options.\nThe Tohono O\u02bcodham Nation is one of the few Indigenous groups to offer tribal citizens access to medical treatment in the United States. Requirements for this enrollment include being a citizen of Mexico and of the Tohono O\u02bcodham Nation. As advocacy for the border wall continues to grow, inspections and securities along these boundaries have heightened, limiting tribal members' access to resources beyond the border.\nCultural revitalization.\nThe cultural resources of the Tohono O\u02bcodham are threatened\u2014particularly the language\u2014but are stronger than those of many other aboriginal groups in the United States.\nEvery February the nation holds the annual Sells Rodeo and Parade in its capital. Sells District rodeo has been an annual event since being founded in 1938. It celebrates traditional frontier skills of riding and managing cattle.\nIn the visual arts, Michael Chiago and the late Leonard Chana gained widespread recognition for their paintings and drawings of traditional O\u02bcodham activities and scenes. Chiago has exhibited at the Heard Museum and has contributed cover art to \"Arizona Highways\" magazine and University of Arizona Press books. Chana illustrated books by Tucson writer Byrd Baylor and created murals for Tohono O\u02bcodham Nation buildings.\nIn 2004, the Heard Museum awarded Danny Lopez its first heritage award, recognizing his lifelong work sustaining the desert people's way of life. At the National Museum for the American Indian (NMAI), the Tohono O\u02bcodham were represented in the founding exhibition and Lopez blessed the exhibit.\nTucson Indian School.\nThe Tohono O\u02bcodham children were required to attend Indian boarding schools, designed to teach them the English language and assimilate them to the mainstream European-American ways. According to historian David Leighton, of the \"Arizona Daily Star\" newspaper, the Tohono O\u02bcodham attended the Tucson Indian School. This boarding school was founded in 1886, when T.C. Kirkwood, superintendent of the board of national missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, asked the Tucson Common Council for land near where the University of Arizona would be built. The Common Council granted the Board of Home Missions a 99-year lease on land at $1 a year. The Board purchased of land on the Santa Cruz River, from early pioneer Sam Hughes.\nThe new facility opened in 1888, with 54 boys and girls. At the new semi-religious boarding school, boys learned rural trades like carpentry and farming, while girls were taught sewing and similar domestic skills of the period. In 1890, additional buildings were completed but the school was still too small for the demand, and students had to be turned away. To raise funds for the school and support its expansion, its superintendent entered into a contract with the city of Tucson to grade and maintain streets. While officially called the Tucson Indian Training School, \"any person of either sex, regardless of race or color\", who showed \"promise of development into a Christian leader or citizen and whose educational needs may, in the judgement of the school, be better served by the school than by another available resource\" was eligible for admission.\nIn 1903, Jose Xavier Pablo, who later went on to become a leader in the Tohono O\u02bcodham Nation, graduated from the school. Three years later, the school bought the land they were leasing from the city of Tucson and sold it at a significant profit. In 1907, they purchased land just east of the Santa Cruz River, near present-day Ajo Way and built a new school. The new boarding school opened in 1908; it has a separate post office, known as the Escuela Post Office. Sometimes this name was used in place of the Tucson Indian School.\nBy the mid-1930s, the Tucson Indian School covered 160 acres, had 9 buildings, and was capable of educating 130 students. In 1940, about 18 different tribes made up the population of students at the school. With changing ideas about the education of tribal children, the federal government began to support education where the children lived with their families. By August 1953, it had no grades lower than 7th grade. In 1960, the school closed its doors. The site was developed as Santa Cruz Plaza, just southwest of Pueblo Magnet High School.\nTohono O\u02bcodham Nation.\nThe Tohono O\u02bcodham Nation within the United States occupies a reservation that incorporates a portion of its people's original Sonoran desert lands. It is organized into eleven districts. The land lies in three counties of the present-day state of Arizona: Pima, Pinal, and Maricopa. The reservation's land area is , the third-largest Indian reservation area in the United States (after the Navajo Nation and the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation). The 2000 census reported 10,787 people living on reservation land. The tribe's enrollment office tallies a population of 25,000, with 20,000 living on its Arizonan reservation lands.\nGovernment.\nThe nation is governed by a three branch system. The executive which includes a chairman and vice-chairman, who are elected by eligible adult members of the nation. According to their constitution, elections are conducted under a complex formula intended to ensure that the rights of small O\u02bcodham communities are protected, as well as the interests of the larger communities and families. The legislative branch which includes the tribal council which is made up two representatives from each of the twelve districts. The third branch is the Judicial which includes five judges. present chairman is Ned Norris Jr, Vice Chairwoman is Wavalene Saunders, Legislative Chairman is Timothy Joaquin Gu Achi, and Chief Judge is Donald Harvey. This can all be found on the Nation's website.\nLands.\nLike other tribes, the Tohono O\u02bcodham felt land pressures from American ranchers, settlers, and the railroads. Documentation was poor, and many members did not leave their lands in a written will. John F. Trudell, a US attorney general assistant recorded an O\u02bcodham man declaring \"I do not know anything about a land grant. The Mexicans never had any land to give us. From the earliest times our fathers have owned land which was given to them by the Earth's prophet.\" Because the O\u02bcodham lived on public lands or had no documentation of ownership, their holdings were threatened by white cattle herders in the 1880s. However, they used their history of cooperation with the government in the Apache Wars to bargain for land rights. Today, O\u02bcodham lands are made up of multiple reservations:\nTohono O\u02bcodham Community Action (TOCA).\nThe Tohono O\u02bcodham Community Action (TOCA) was founded by current CEO and President Terrol Dew Johnson and co-founder Tristan Reader in 1996 on the basis of wanting to restore and re-integrate lost tribal traditions into the community. Located in Sells, Arizona, they originally started as a community garden and offered basketweaving classes. Now, the organization has expanded to having its own two farms, restaurant, and art gallery.\nAnother influence to the creation of this organization originates from the fact that the Indigenous tribe was on the brink of collapse as a result of growing dependency on welfare and food stamps. The Tohono O\u02bcodham people were facing the lowest per capita income of any Indigenous reservation, with 65 percent of members living below the poverty line and 70 percent facing unemployment. Crime amongst the younger generation rapidly increased as a result of gang activity and the high school drop out rate was over 50 percent. Homicide was prevalent within the community, with the rate being three times the national average.\nIn 2009, TOCA opened its restaurant, Desert Rain Caf\u00e9. The purpose of the cafe's launch was to bring traditional tribal foods to the community in order to help combat the growing presence of Type 2 diabetes. Thus, the restaurant practices the integration of traditional foods with each menu item containing at least one traditional ingredient, such as mesquite meal, prickly pear, or agave syrup. For crops such as tepary beans or squash, the caf\u00e9 utilizes their farms to produce these goods, providing customers with fresh meals. Some of their dishes include a Mesquite Oatmeal Cookie, Short Rib Stew, Brown Tepary bean Quesadilla, or pico de gallo. It has been estimated that the restaurant serves over 100,000 meals yearly.\nBasket weaving was a dominant cultural characteristic, being used in rain ceremonies that lasted for four days and nights. These baskets were also purposed for daily use to hold or prepare foods. At the start of the institution, Johnson would hold weekly classes on Wednesday for artisans throughout the reservation. Making a basket could take as long as one year. This prolonged process stems from the fact that the fibers used in these baskets must be harvested and prepared, plus creating a design that represents the history of the Tohono O\u02bcodham nation. Materials for baskets vary between grasses native to the area, such as Yucca grass and devil's claw plant, an awl, and knife.\nMartin Luther King Jr.'s first visit to an Indian reservation.\nOn April 2, 2017, in the \"Arizona Daily Star\" newspaper, historian David Leighton related what is believed to be Martin Luther King Jr's first visit to an Indian reservation, the Tohono O\u02bcodham Indian Reservation.\nOn September 20, 1959, Martin Luther King Jr. flew to Tucson from Los Angeles to give a talk at the Sunday Evening Forum. On that night, he gave a speech called \"A Great Time To Be Alive\", at the University of Arizona auditorium, now called Centennial Hall. Following the forum, a reception was held for King, in which he was introduced to Rev. Casper Glenn, the pastor of a multiracial church called the Southside Presbyterian Church. King was very interested in this racially mixed church and made arrangements to visit it the next day.\nThe following morning, Glenn picked up King in his Plymouth station wagon and drove him to the Southside Presbyterian Church. There, Glenn showed King photographs he had taken of the racially diverse congregation, most of whom were part of the Tohono O\u02bcodham tribal group at the time. Glenn remembers that upon seeing the photos, \"King said he had never been on an Indian reservation, nor had he ever had a chance to get to know any Indians.\" He then requested to be driven to the nearby reservation, as a spur-of-the-moment desire.\nThe two men traveled on Ajo Way to Sells, on what was then called the Papago Indian Reservation, now the Tohono O\u02bcodham Indian Reservation. When they arrived at the tribal council office, the tribal leaders were surprised to see King and very honored he had come to visit them. King was very anxious to talk to them but was circumspect with his questions. \"He was fascinated by everything that they shared with him,\" Glenn said.\nThe ministers then went to the local Presbyterian church in Sells, which had been recently constructed by its members, with funds provided by the national Presbyterian church. King had a chance to speak to Pastor Towsand, who was excited to meet King. On the way back to Tucson, \"King expressed his appreciation of having the opportunity to meet the Indians,\" Glenn recalled.\nDistricts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the second-most populous city in Arizona with a population of 542,630 at the 2020 census, behind the capital city Phoenix, while the Tucson metropolitan statistical area has an estimated 1.08 million residents and is the 52nd-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. Tucson and Phoenix anchor the Arizona Sun Corridor. The city is southeast of Phoenix and north of the United States\u2013Mexico border. It is home to the University of Arizona.\nMajor incorporated suburbs of Tucson include Oro Valley and Marana northwest of the city, Sahuarita south of the city, and South Tucson in an enclave south of downtown. Communities in the vicinity of Tucson (some within or overlapping the city limits) include Casas Adobes, Catalina Foothills, Flowing Wells, Midvale Park, Tanque Verde, Tortolita, and Vail. Towns outside the Tucson metropolitan area include Three Points, Benson to the southeast, Catalina and Oracle to the north, and Green Valley to the south.\nTucson was founded as a military fort by the Spanish when Hugo O'Conor authorized the construction of Presidio San Agust\u00edn del Tucs\u00f3n in 1775. It was included in the state of Sonora after Mexico gained independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821. The United States acquired a region of present-day southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico from Mexico under the Gadsden Purchase in 1853. Tucson served as the capital of the Arizona Territory from 1867 to 1877. Tucson was Arizona's largest city by population during the territorial period and early statehood, until it was surpassed by Phoenix by 1920. Nevertheless, its population growth remained strong during the late 20th century. Tucson was the first American city to be designated a \"City of Gastronomy\" by UNESCO in 2015.\nThe Spanish name of the city, (), is derived from the O'odham (). is a stative verb meaning \"(be) black, (be) dark\". is (in this usage) a noun referring to the base or foundation of something. The name is commonly translated into English as \"the base [of the hill] is black\", a reference to a basalt-covered hill now known as Sentinel Peak. Tucson is sometimes referred to as the Old Pueblo and Optics Valley, the latter referring to its optical science and telescopes known worldwide.\nHistory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical affiliations\n Spanish Empire (1775\u20131821) First Mexican Empire (1821\u20131823) United Mexican States (1823\u20131854) (1854\u20131861) Confederate States (1861\u20131862) (1862-present)\nThe Tucson area was probably first visited by Paleo-Indians, who were known to have been in southern Arizona about 12,000 years ago. Recent archaeological excavations near the Santa Cruz River found a village site dating from 2100\u00a0BC. The floodplain of the Santa Cruz River was extensively farmed during the Early Agricultural Period, c.\u20091200\u00a0BC to AD\u00a0150. These people hunted, gathered wild plants and nuts, and ate corn, beans, and other crops grown using irrigation canals they constructed.\nThe Early Ceramic period occupation of Tucson had the first extensive use of pottery vessels for cooking and storage. The groups designated as the Hohokam lived in the area from AD\u00a0600 to 1450 and are known for their vast irrigation canal systems and their red-on-brown pottery.\nItalian Jesuit missionary Eusebio Francisco Kino first visited the Santa Cruz River valley in 1692. He founded the Mission San Xavier del Bac in 1700, about upstream from the site of the settlement of Tucson. A separate Convento settlement was founded downstream along the Santa Cruz River, near the base of what is now known as \"A\" mountain. Hugo Ocon\u00f3r (Hugo O'Conor), the founding father of the city of Tucson, Arizona, authorized the construction of a military fort in that location, \"Presidio San Agust\u00edn del Tucs\u00f3n,\" on August 20, 1775 (the present downtown Pima County Courthouse was built near this site). During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the Second Battle of Tucson were repeatedly mounted by the Apache. Eventually, the town came to be called \"Tucs\u00f3n,\" a Spanish version of the O'odham word for the area. It was included in the state of Sonora after Mexico gained independence from the Kingdom of Spain and its Spanish Empire in 1821\nDuring the Mexican\u2013American War in 1846\u20131848, Tucs\u00f3n was captured by Philip St. George Cooke with the Mormon Battalion, but it soon returned to Mexican control as Cooke proceeded to the west, establishing Cooke's Wagon Road to California. Tucs\u00f3n was not included in the Mexican Cession to the United States following the war. Cooke's road through Tucs\u00f3n became one of the important routes into California during the California Gold Rush of 1849.\nThe US acquired those portions of modern-day Arizona that lay south of the Gila River by treaty from Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase on June 8, 1854. Under this treaty and purchase, Tucs\u00f3n became a part of the United States of America. The American military did not formally take over control until March 1856. In time, the name of the town became standardized in English in its current form, where the stress is on the first syllable, the \"u\" is long, and the \"c\" is silent.\nIn 1857, Tucson was established as a stage station on the San Antonio\u2013San Diego Mail Line. In 1858, it became third division headquarters of the Butterfield Overland Mail and operated until the line was shut down in March 1861. The Overland Mail Corporation attempted to continue running, but following the Bascom Affair, devastating Apache attacks on the stations and coaches ended operations in August 1861.\nIn March 1861, a series of secession conventions were held throughout the region known as \"Traditional Arizona\", including in Tucson. The conventions adopted a secession ordinance, citing the region's common interests and geography with the Confederacy, their political sympathy with the Southern secession movement, their opposition to the \"sectional\" party, the \"Black\" Republicans, the need of frontier protection, and the loss of postal service routes under the United States government, as reasons for their separation. The conventions subsequently established a provisional territorial government for the Confederate \"Territory of Arizona.\"\nEfforts by the Confederacy to secure control of the region led to the New Mexico Campaign. Baylor sent Company A, Arizona Rangers to Tucson to protect the population from the Apache and delay the advance of Union troops from Fort Yuma.\nDuring the Civil War, the Tucson area saw several military engagements, primarily involving cavalry forces from the Union and Confederacy. The most significant of these was the Battle of Picacho Pass on April 15, 1862. Although the Confederate forces claimed a tactical victory at the pass, they were soon compelled to withdraw. The Union forces subsequently secured and held the territory, ensuring Union control of the region for the duration of the conflict.\nOn May 20, 1862, Union forces entered Tucson and captured the city. The city subsequently became part of the new Union Territory of Arizona.\nTucson was incorporated in 1877, making it the oldest incorporated city in Arizona.\nFrom 1877 to 1878, the area suffered a rash of stagecoach robberies. Most notable were the two holdups committed by masked road agent William Whitney Brazelton. Brazelton held up two stages in the summer of 1878 near Point of Mountain Station, about northwest of Tucson. John Clum, of Tombstone, Arizona, fame, was one of the passengers. Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell and his citizen posse killed Brazelton on August 19, 1878, in a mesquite bosque along the Santa Cruz River south of Tucson. Brazelton had been suspected of highway robbery in the Tucson area, the Prescott region, and the Silver City, New Mexico area. Because of the crimes and threats to his business, John J. Valentine Sr. of Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. had sent Bob Paul, a special agent and future Pima County sheriff, to investigate. The US Army established Fort Lowell, then east of Tucson, to help protect settlers and travelers from Apache attacks.\nIn 1882, Morgan Earp was fatally shot, in what was later referred to in the press as the \"Earp\u2013Clanton Tragedy\". Marietta Spence, wife of Pete Spence, one of the Cochise County Cowboys, testified at the coroner's inquest on Earp's killing and implicated Frank Stilwell in the murder. The coroner's jury concluded Pete Spence, Stilwell, Frederick Bode, and Florentino \"Indian Charlie\" Cruz were the prime suspects in the assassination of Morgan Earp.\nDeputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp gathered a few trusted friends and accompanied Virgil Earp and his family as they traveled to Benson to take a train to California. They found Stilwell apparently lying in wait for Virgil Earp at the Tucson station and killed Stilwell on the tracks. After killing Stilwell, Wyatt deputized others and conducted a vendetta, killing three more cowboys over the next few days before leaving the territory.\nJim Leavy had built a reputation of having fought in at least 16 gunfights. On June 5, 1882, Leavy had an argument with faro dealer John Murphy in Tucson. The two agreed to have a duel on the Mexican border, but after hearing of Leavy's exploits as a gunfighter, Murphy decided to ambush Leavy instead. Together with two of his friends, Murphy ambushed Leavy as he was leaving the Palace Hotel, killing him. According to Wright, the three co-defendants in Leavy's murder later escaped from the Pima County Jail, but were later recaptured. Murphy and Gibson were found in Fenner, California, living under assumed names; they were retried for the murder before being found not guilty. Moyer was captured in Denver and sentenced to life in Yuma Territorial Prison, but was pardoned in 1888.\nPost-frontier life.\nAs other settlers tried to overcome violent frontier society, in 1885, the territorial legislature founded the University of Arizona as a land-grant college on what was overgrazed ranchland between Tucson and Fort Lowell.\nIn 1890, Asians made up 4.2% of the city's population. They were predominantly Chinese men who had been recruited as workers on the railroads.\nBy 1900, Tucson had 7,531 residents. By 1910, the population increased to 13,913. About this time, the U.S. Veterans Administration had begun construction of the present Veterans Hospital. The city's clean, dry air made it a destination for many veterans who had been gassed in World War I and needed respiratory therapy. In addition, these dry and high-altitude conditions were thought to be ideal for the treatment of tuberculosis, for which no cures were known before antibiotics were developed against it.\nThe city continued to grow, with the population increasing to 20,292 in 1920 and 36,818 in 1940. In 2006, the estimated population of Pima County, in which Tucson is located, passed one million, while the City of Tucson's population was 535,000.\nIn 1912, Arizona was admitted as a state. This increased the number of flags that had been flown over Tucson to five: Spanish, Mexican, United States, Confederate, and the State of Arizona.\nDuring the territorial and early statehood periods, Tucson was Arizona's largest city and commercial center, while Phoenix was the seat of state government (beginning in 1889) and agriculture. The development of Tucson Municipal Airport increased the city's prominence. Between 1910 and 1920, though, Phoenix surpassed Tucson in population, and has continued to outpace Tucson in growth. In recent years, both Tucson and Phoenix have had some of the highest growth rates of any jurisdiction in the United States.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2010, the City of Tucson has a land area of . The city's elevation is above sea level (as measured at the Tucson International Airport). Tucson is on an alluvial plain in the Sonoran Desert, surrounded by five minor ranges of mountains: the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Tortolita Mountains to the north, the Santa Rita Mountains to the south, the Rincon Mountains to the east, and the Tucson Mountains to the west. Tucson Mountains include Wasson Peak. The highest point in the area is Mount Wrightson, found in the Santa Rita Mountains at above sea level.\nTucson is southeast of Phoenix and north of the United States\u2013Mexico border by interstate highway. The 2020 United States census puts the city's population at 542,629 with a metropolitan area population at 1,043,433. In 2020, Tucson ranked as the 33rd-largest city and 53rd-largest metropolitan area in the United States. A major city in the Arizona Sun Corridor, Tucson is the largest city in southern Arizona, and the second-largest in the state after Phoenix. It is also the largest city in the area of the historic Gadsden Purchase. As of 2015, the Greater Tucson Metro area has exceeded a population of 1 million.\nThe city is built along the Santa Cruz River, formerly a perennial river. Now a dry riverbed for much of the year, it regularly floods during significant seasonal rains.\nInterstate 10 runs northwest through town, connecting Tucson to Phoenix to the northwest (on the way to its western terminus in Santa Monica, California), and to Las Cruces, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas to the southeast. (Its eastern terminus is in Jacksonville, Florida).\nI-19 runs south from Tucson toward Nogales and the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. I-19 is the only Interstate highway that uses \"kilometer posts\" instead of \"mileposts\". However, speed limits are marked in miles per hour and kilometers per hour.\nNeighborhoods.\nDowntown and Central Tucson.\nSimilar to many other cities in the Western US, Tucson was developed by European Americans on a grid plan starting in the late 19th century, with the city center at Stone Avenue and Broadway Boulevard. While this intersection was initially near the geographic center of Tucson, the center has shifted as the city has expanded far to the east. Development to the west was effectively blocked by the Tucson Mountains. Covering a large geographic area, Tucson has many distinct neighborhoods.\nTucson's earliest neighborhoods, some of which were redeveloped and covered by the Tucson Convention Center (TCC), include:\nOther historical neighborhoods near downtown include:\nAt the end of the 2010s, city planners and the business community worked to redevelop downtown Tucson. The primary project was Rio Nuevo, a large retail and community center that had been stalled in planning for more than a decade. One Rio Nuevo project that was successful is Mission Garden. Related to Tucson's City of Gastronomy designation, this living agricultural museum at the base of Sentinel Peak west of downtown grows heritage crops and heirloom trees that represent people who have lived in the area for thousands of years. Downtown is generally regarded as the area bordered by 17th Street to the south, I-10 to the west, and 6th Street to the north, and Toole Avenue and the Union Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific) railroad tracks, site of the historic train depot on the east side. Downtown is divided into the Presidio District, the Barrio Viejo, and the Congress Street Arts and Entertainment District. Some authorities include the 4th Avenue shopping district, northeast of the rest of downtown and connected by an underpass beneath the UPRR tracks.\nHistoric attractions downtown with rich architecture include the Hotel Congress designed in 1919, the Art Deco Fox Theatre designed in 1929, the Rialto Theatre opened in 1920, and St. Augustine Cathedral completed in 1896. Included on the National Register of Historic Places is the old Pima County Courthouse, designed by Roy Place in 1928. El Charro Caf\u00e9, Tucson's oldest restaurant, operates its main location downtown.\nAs one of the oldest parts of town, Central Tucson is anchored by the Broadway Village shopping center, designed by local architect Josias Joesler at the intersection of Broadway Boulevard and Country Club Road. The 4th Avenue Shopping District between downtown, the university, and the Lost Barrio just east of downtown, also has many unique and popular stores. Local retail business in Central Tucson is densely concentrated along Fourth Avenue and the Main Gate Square on University Boulevard near the UA campus. El Con Mall is also in the eastern part of midtown.\nThe University of Arizona, chartered in 1885, is in midtown and includes Arizona Stadium and McKale Center (named for J.F. \"Pop\" McKale, a prominent coach and athletics administrator at the university).\nThe historic Tucson High School (designed by Roy Place in 1924) was featured in the 1987 film \"Can't Buy Me Love\". The Arizona Inn (built in 1930) and the Tucson Botanical Gardens are also in Central Tucson.\nTucson's largest park, Reid Park, is in midtown and includes Reid Park Zoo and Hi Corbett Field. Speedway Boulevard, a major east\u2013west arterial road in central Tucson, was named the \"ugliest street in America\" by \"Life\" in the early 1970s, quoting Tucson Mayor James Corbett.\nIn the late 1990s, Speedway Boulevard was awarded \"Street of the Year\" by \"Arizona Highways.\" Speedway Boulevard was named after an historic horse racetrack, known as the Harlem River Speedway, and more commonly called \"The Speedway\", in New York City. The Tucson street was called \"The Speedway\" from 1904 to about 1906, when \"The\" was removed from the title.\nAs of the early 21st century, Central Tucson is considered bicycle-friendly. To the east of the University of Arizona, Third Street is bike-only except for local traffic; it passes by the historic homes of the Sam Hughes neighborhood. To the west, East University Boulevard leads to the Fourth Avenue Shopping District. To the North, North Mountain Avenue has a full bike-only lane for half of the to the Rillito River Park bike and walk multi-use path. To the south, North Highland Avenue leads to the Barraza-Aviation Parkway bicycle path.\nSouthern Tucson.\nSouth Tucson is the name of an independent, incorporated town of south of downtown. It is surrounded by the City of Tucson and was incorporated in 1936 and reincorporated in 1940.\nThe population is about 83% Mexican-American and 10% Native American, as residents self-identify in the census. South Tucson is widely known for its many Mexican restaurants and architectural styles. Bright murals have been painted on some walls, but city policy discourages this and many have been painted over.\nThe south side of the city of Tucson is generally considered to be the area around south of 22nd Street, east of I-19, west of Davis Monthan Air Force Base and southwest of Aviation Parkway, and north of Los Reales Road. The Tucson International Airport and Tucson Electric Park are located here.\nWestern Tucson.\nThe West Side has areas of both urban and suburban development. It is generally defined as the area west of I-10. Western Tucson encompasses the banks of the Santa Cruz River and the foothills of the Tucson Mountains. Area attractions include the International Wildlife Museum and Sentinel Peak. The Marriott Starr Pass Resort and Spa serves travelers and residents. As travelers pass the Tucson Mountains, they enter the area commonly referred to as \"west of\" Tucson or \"Old West Tucson\". In this large, undulating plain extending south into the Altar Valley, rural residential development predominates. Attractions include Saguaro National Park West, and movie set/theme park developed at the Old Tucson Studios.\nOn Sentinel Peak, just west of downtown, a giant \"A\" was installed in honor of the University of Arizona, resulting in the nickname \"A\" Mountain. Starting in about 1915, an annual tradition developed for freshmen to whitewash the A, which was visible for miles. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, the A was painted red, white, and blue. At the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003, antiwar activists painted the A black. Competition ensued, with various sides repainting the A in different colors until the city council intervened and made the red, white, and blue colors official. In 2013, the color scheme changed back to white. Another color may be decided by a biennial election. With the tricolor scheme, some observers complain the shape of the A is hard to distinguish from the background of the peak. Since 1993, the A has been painted green for St. Patrick's Day. It has also been given other color schemes for different causes.\nNorthern Tucson.\nNorth Tucson includes the urban neighborhoods of Amphitheater and Flowing Wells. Usually considered the area north of Fort Lowell Road, North Tucson includes some of Tucson's primary commercial zones (Tucson Mall and the Oracle Road Corridor). Many of the city's most upscale boutiques, restaurants, and art galleries are also on the north side, including St. Philip's Plaza. The plaza is directly adjacent to the historic St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church (built in 1936).\nThe north side also is home to the suburban community of Catalina Foothills, in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains just north of the city limits. This community includes many of the area's most expensive homes, sometimes multimillion-dollar estates. The Foothills area is generally defined as north of River Road, east of Oracle Road and west of Sabino Creek. Some of the Tucson area's major resorts are in the Catalina Foothills, including Hacienda Del Sol, Westin La Paloma Resort, Loews Ventana Canyon Resort and Canyon Ranch Resort. La Encantada, an outdoor shopping mall, is also in the Foothills.\nThe DeGrazia Gallery of the Sun is near the intersection of Swan Road and Skyline Drive. Built by artist Ted DeGrazia starting in 1951, the property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and features an eclectic chapel, an art gallery, and a museum.\nThe expansive area northwest of the city limits is diverse, ranging from the rural communities of Catalina and parts of the town of Marana, the small suburb of Picture Rocks, the town of Oro Valley in the western foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains, and residential areas in the northeastern foothills of the Tucson Mountains. Continental Ranch (Marana), Dove Mountain (Marana), and Rancho Vistoso (Oro Valley), and Saddlebrooke (North Oro Valley) are all master planned communities in the northwest that have thousands of residents.\nThe community of Casas Adobes is also on the Northwest side, with the distinction of being Tucson's first suburb, established in the late 1940s. Casas Adobes is centered on the historic Casas Adobes Plaza (built in 1948). Casas Adobes is also home to Tohono Chul Park, which is now within the town of Oro Valley, (a nature preserve) near the intersection of North Oracle Road and West Ina Road. The attempted assassination of Representative Gabby Giffords, which resulted in the murders of chief judge for the U.S. District Court for Arizona, John Roll, and five other people on January 8, 2011, occurred at the La Toscana Village in Casas Adobes. The Foothills Mall is also on the northwest side in Casas Adobes.\nThis area is home to many of the Tucson area's golf courses and resorts, including the Preserve and Mountainview Golf Clubs at Saddlebrooke, Hilton El Conquistador Golf &amp; Tennis Resort in Oro Valley, the Omni Tucson National Resort &amp; Spa, and Westward Look Resort. The Ritz Carlton at Dove Mountain, the second Ritz Carlton resort in Arizona, which also includes a golf course, opened in the foothills of the Tortolita Mountains in northeast Marana in 2009.\nEastern Tucson.\nEast Tucson is relatively new compared to other parts of the city, developed between the 1950s and the 1970s, with developments such as Desert Palms Park. It is generally classified as the area of the city east of Swan Road, with above-average real estate values relative to the rest of the city. The area includes urban and suburban development near the Rincon Mountains. East Tucson includes Saguaro National Park East. Tucson's \"Restaurant Row\" is also on the east side, along with a significant corporate and financial presence. Restaurant Row is sandwiched by three of Tucson's storied Vicinages: Harold Bell Wright Estates, named after the author's ranch which occupied some of that area before the depression; the Tucson Country Club (the third to bear the name Tucson Country Club), and the Dorado Country Club. Tucson's largest office building is 5151 East Broadway in east Tucson, completed in 1975. The first phases of Williams Centre, a mixed-use, master-planned development on Broadway near Craycroft Road, were opened in 1987. Park Place, a recently renovated shopping center, is also along Broadway (west of Wilmot Road).\nNear the intersection of Craycroft and Ft. Lowell Roads are the remnants of the Historic Fort Lowell. This area has become one of Tucson's iconic neighborhoods. In 1891, the Fort was abandoned and much of the interior was stripped of their useful components and it quickly fell into ruin. In 1900, three of the officer buildings were purchased for use as a sanitarium. The sanitarium was then sold to Harvey Adkins in 1928. The Bolsius family \u2013 Pete, Nan and Charles \u2013 purchased and renovated surviving adobe buildings of the Fort, transforming them into spectacular artistic southwestern architectural examples. Their woodwork, plaster treatment and sense of proportion drew on their Dutch heritage and New Mexican experience.\nOther artists and academics throughout the middle of the 20th century, including Win Ellis, Jack Maul, Madame Germaine Cheruy and Ren\u00e9 Cheruy, Giorgio Belloli, Charles Bode, Veronica Hughart, Edward H. Spicer and Rosamond Spicer, Hazel Larson Archer and Ruth Brown, renovated adobes, built homes and lived in the area. The artist colony attracted writers and poets including beat generation Alan Harrington and Jack Kerouac whose visit is documented in his iconic book \"On the Road\". This rural pocket in the middle of the city is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Each year in February the vicinage celebrates its history in the City Landmark it owns and restored the San Pedro Chapel.\nSituated between the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Rincon Mountains near Redington Pass northeast of the city limits is the affluent community of Tanque Verde. The Arizona National Golf Club, Forty-Niners Country Club, and the historic Tanque Verde Guest Ranch are also in northeast Tucson.\nSoutheast Tucson continues to experience rapid residential development. The area includes Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The area is considered to be south of Golf Links Road. It is the home of Santa Rita High School, Chuck Ford Park (Lakeside Park), Lakeside Lake, Lincoln Park (upper and lower), The Lakecrest Vicinagess, and Pima Community College East Campus. The Atterbury Wash with its access to excellent bird watching is also in the Southeast Tucson area. The suburban community of Rita Ranch houses many of the military families from Davis-Monthan, and is near the southeasternmost expansion of the current city limits. Close by Rita Ranch and also within the city limits lies Civano, a planned development meant to showcase ecologically sound building practices and lifestyles.\nClimate.\nTucson has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"BWh\"), with two major seasons, a hot summer and mild winter. Tucson averages of precipitation per year, concentrated during the Pacific storms of winter and the North American Monsoon of summer. Fall and spring tend to be sunny and dry. Despite being at a more southerly latitude than Phoenix, Tucson is slightly cooler and wetter due to a variety of factors, including elevation and orographic lift in surrounding mountains, though Tucson does occasionally see warmer daytime temperatures in the winter.\nSummer is characterized by average daily high temperatures between and low temperatures between . Early summer is characterized by low humidity and clear skies; mid- and late summer are characterized by higher humidity, cloudy skies, and frequent rain. The sun is intense in Tucson during part of the year, and those who spend time outdoors need protection. Recent studies show that the rate of skin cancer in Arizona is at least three times higher than in more northerly regions. Additionally, heat stroke is a concern for hikers, mountain bikers, and adventurers who explore canyons, open desert lands, and other exposed areas.\nWhile monsoon season officially begins on June 15, the arrival of the North American Monsoon is unpredictable, as it varies from year to year. On average, Tucson receives its first monsoon storms around July 3. Monsoon activity generally persists through August and often into September. During the monsoon, the humidity is much higher than the rest of the year. It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon, followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause flash floods. The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes. Large areas of the city do not have storm sewers, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours. A few underpasses in Tucson have \"feet of water\" scales painted on their supports to discourage fording by automobiles during a rainstorm. Arizona traffic code Title 28\u2013910, the so-called \"Stupid Motorist Law\", was instituted in 1995 to discourage people from entering flooded roadways. If the road is flooded and a barricade is in place, motorists who drive around the barricade can be charged up to $2,000 for costs involved in rescuing them. Despite the warnings and precautions, three Tucson drivers have drowned between 2004 and 2010.\nThe weather in the fall is much like spring, dry, with warm/cool nights and warm/hot days. Temperatures above are possible into early October. Temperatures decline at the quickest rate in October and November, and are normally the coolest in late December and early January.\nWinters in Tucson are mild relative to other parts of the United States. Average daytime highs range between , with overnight lows between . Tucson typically averages three hard freezes per winter season, with temperatures dipping to the mid- or low 20 degrees F (\u22124 to \u22127\u00a0\u00b0C), but this is typically limited to only a very few nights. Although rare, snow occasionally falls in lower elevations in Tucson and is common in the Santa Catalina Mountains. The most recent snowfall was on March 2, 2023, when a winter storm caused snow to fall throughout most of the southwest. Tucson airport recorded of snow, the seventh heaviest March snowfall on record.\nEarly spring is characterized by gradually rising temperatures and several weeks of vivid wildflower blooms beginning in late February and into March. During this time of year the diurnal temperature variation occurs with a temperature change often surpassing daily.\nSince records began in 1894, the record maximum temperature was on June 27, 1990, and the record minimum temperature was on January 7, 1913. There are an average of 158 days annually with highs of or higher and an average of 12 days with lows reaching or below the freezing mark. Average annual precipitation is . On average, 47.4 days have measurable precipitation. The wettest year was 1905, with and the driest year was 2020 with . The most precipitation in one month was in July 2021. The most precipitation in 24 hours was on July 29, 1958. Annual snowfall averages . The most snow in one winter was in winter 1971\u20131972.

Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, on the city's southeastern edge, also provides many jobs for Tucson residents. Its presence, as well as the presence of the US Army Intelligence Center (Fort Huachuca, the region's largest employer, in nearby Sierra Vista), has led to the development of many high-technology industries, including government contractors. The city of Tucson is also a major hub for the Union Pacific Railroad's Sunset Route that links the Los Angeles ports with the South/Southeast regions of the country.\nRaytheon Missiles and Defense (formerly Hughes Aircraft Co.), Texas Instruments, IBM, Intuit Inc., Universal Avionics, Honeywell Aerospace, Sunquest Information Systems, Sanofi-Aventis, Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., and Bombardier Aerospace all have a large presence in Tucson. Roughly 150 Tucson companies are involved in the design and manufacture of optics and optoelectronics systems, earning Tucson the nickname \"Optics Valley\". Much of this comes from the Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona, which is one of few locations in the world that can cast the enormous mirrors used in telescopes around the world and in space.\nTourism is another major industry in Tucson. The city's many resorts, hotels, and attractions bring in $2\u00a0billion and over 3.5\u00a0million visitors annually.\nOne of the major annual attractions is the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show, and its associated shows, all held generally in the first two weeks of February. These associated shows (such as gems, jewelry, beads, and fossils) are held throughout the city, with 43 different shows in 2010. This makes Tucson's the largest such exposition in the world. Its yearly economic impact in 2015 was evaluated at $120\u00a0million.\nIn addition to vacationers, many winter residents, or \"snowbirds\", are attracted to Tucson's mild winters and live here on a seasonal basis. They also contribute to the local economy. Snowbirds often purchase second homes in Tucson and nearby areas, contributing significantly to the property tax base.\nTop employers.\nAccording to Tucson's 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:\nArts and culture.\nAnnual cultural events and fairs.\nTucson Gem and Mineral Show.\nThe Tucson Gem &amp; Mineral Show is one of the largest gem and mineral shows in the world and has been held for over 50 years.

It was recently named a top-10 road race in the United States, ranking at #4.\nTucson Folk Festival.\nFor the past 33 years, the Tucson Folk Festival has taken place the first Saturday and Sunday of May in downtown Tucson's El Presidio Park. In addition to nationally known headline acts each evening, the Festival highlights over 100 local and regional musicians on five stages and is one of the largest free festivals in the country. All stages are within easy walking distance. Organized by the Tucson Kitchen Musicians' Association, volunteers make this festival possible. KXCI 91.3-FM, Arizona's only community radio station, is a major partner, broadcasting from the Plaza Stage throughout the weekend. There are also many workshops, events for children, sing-alongs, and a popular singer-songwriter contest. Musicians typically play 30-minute sets, supported by professional audio staff volunteers. A variety of food and crafts are available at the festival, as well as local microbrews. All proceeds help fund future festivals.\nFourth Avenue Street Fair.\nThere are two Fourth Avenue Street Fairs, in December and late March/early April, staged between 9th Street and University Boulevard, that feature arts and crafts booths, food vendors and street performers. The fairs began in 1970 when Fourth Avenue, which at the time had half a dozen thrift shops, several New Age bookshops and the Food Conspiracy Co-Op, was a gathering place for hippies, and a few merchants put tables in front of their stores to attract customers before the holidays.\nThese days, the street fair has grown into a large corporate event, with most tables owned by outside merchants. It hosts mostly traveling craftsmen selling various arts such as pottery, paintings, wood working, metal decorations, candles, and many others.\nTucson Rodeo (Fiesta de los Vaqueros).\nAnother popular event held in February, which is early spring in Tucson, is the Fiesta de los Vaqueros, or rodeo week, founded by winter visitor, Leighton Kramer. While at its heart the Fiesta is a sporting event, it includes what is billed as \"the world's largest non-mechanized parade\". The Rodeo Parade is a popular event as most schools give two rodeo days off instead of Presidents' Day. The exception is Presidio High (a non-public charter school), which does not get either. Western wear is seen throughout the city as corporate dress codes are cast aside during the Fiesta. The Fiesta de los Vaqueros marks the beginning of the rodeo season in the United States.\nTucson Meet Yourself.\nEvery October for the past 30 years, the Tucson Meet Yourself festival has celebrated the city's many ethnic groups. For one weekend, the downtown area features dancing, singing, artwork, and food from more than 30 different ethnicities. The event is held at and around the Jacome Plaza, located in front of the Joel D. Valdez Main Library. All performers are from Tucson and the surrounding area, in keeping with the idea of \"meeting yourself\". The records of the Tucson Meet Yourself Festival reside at the University of Arizona Special Collections Library.\nTucson Modernism Week.\nSince 2012, during the first two weekends of October, the Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation hosts Tucson Modernism Week.

Modeled on the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), it combines aspects of many different cultural traditions. The first All Souls Procession was organized by local artist Susan Kay Johnson in 1990 and involved 35 participants; by 2013, participation was estimated at 50,000.\nThe Procession, held at sundown, consists of a non-motorized parade through downtown Tucson featuring many floats, sculptures, and memorials, in which the community is encouraged to participate. The parade is followed by performances on an outdoor stage, culminating in the burning of an urn in which written prayers have been collected from participants and spectators. The event is organized and funded by the non-profit arts organization Many Mouths One Stomach, with the help of volunteers and donations from the public and local businesses.\nCyclovia Tucson.\nCyclovia Tucson is an annual event supported by Living Streets Alliance that invites people of all ages and abilities to walk, bike, and roll down car-free streets for a day. Cyclovia is an Open Streets initiative designed to maximize the enormous amount of space taken up by roads in sprawling cities like Tucson. Since 2012, Cyclovia transforms the streets of metro Tucson into a block party atmosphere to socialize, incorporating partnerships with small businesses, and giving people the opportunity to move freely through the streets without moving cars. Cyclovia happens twice a year, typically in the spring and in the fall.\nCultural and other attractions.\nCultural and other attractions include:\nFourth Avenue, near the University of Arizona, is home to many shops, restaurants, and bars, and hosts the annual 4th Avenue Street Fair every December and March. University Boulevard, leading directly to the UA Main Gate, is also the center of numerous bars, retail shops, and restaurants most commonly frequented by the large student population of the UA.\nEl Tiradito is a religious shrine in the downtown area. The shrine dates back to the early days of Tucson. It is based on a love story of revenge and murder.

The Tucson Girls Chorus runs six choirs and numerous satellite choirs which perform locally, nationally, and internationally.\nTucson is considered an influential center for Mariachi music and is home to a large number of Mariachi musicians and singers. The Tucson International Mariachi Conference, hosted annually since 1982, involves several hundred mariachi bands and folklorica dance troops during a three-day festival in April. The Norte\u00f1o Festival and Street Fair in the enclave city of South Tucson is held annually at the end of summer.\nTucson is also known nationally for its punk scene. Since the late 1970s punk subculture has flourished in Tucson. At present there are multiple punk bars downtown and house venues in the surrounding neighborhoods.\nProminent musicians based in Tucson or with ties to the city include Linda Ronstadt, Lalo Guerrero, The Dusty Chaps, Howe Gelb, Bob Log III, Calexico, Giant Sand, Hipster Daddy-O and the Handgrenades, The Bled, AJJ, Ramshackle Glory, and Tucson's official troubadour Ted Ramirez. The Tucson Area Music Awards, or TAMMIES, are an annual event.\nTelevision and film.\nTucson has been the setting and filming location for multiple films. Some notable films that have been filmed in Tucson include \"Revenge of the Nerds\", \"Can't Buy Me Love\", \"Major League\", \"Tombstone\", and \"Tin Cup\". The city is also a common filming location and setting for Western films, most were filmed at Old Tucson. The television show \"Hey Dude\" was filmed at Tanque Verde Ranch. Additionally, the fictional motorcycle clubs the Sons of Anarchy and Mayans from the television shows \"Sons of Anarchy\" and \"Mayans M.C.\" both have Tucson chapters that are featured in the show. In the season 4 \"Sons of Anarchy\" episode \"Una Venta\", the cast travels to Tucson to discuss an issue with the Tucson chapter. The upcoming TV series \"Duster\" began filming in Tucson in October 2021. The series is specifically being filmed in downtown Tucson and the Tucson Mountains region of Saguaro National Park.\nCuisine.\nTucson is well known for its Sonoran-style Mexican food. Since the turn of the century, other ethnic restaurants and fine dining choices have proliferated. Tucson cuisine is influenced by a diverse group of peoples, from Native Americans to Spanish settlers, Anglo-American ranchers and rail workers from China.\nIn 2015, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated Tucson a \"world city of gastronomy\" under the Creative Cities Network program, becoming thus the first city of gastronomy in the United States. The city's focus on food includes Mission Garden, a living agricultural museum that showcases the crops and trees that have been grown in the area for over 4,000 years.\nThe Sonoran hot dog is very popular in Tucson. A hot dog is wrapped in bacon and grilled, served on a bolillo-style hot dog bun, and topped with pinto beans, onions, tomatoes, and a variety of additional condiments, often including mayonnaise, mustard, and jalape\u00f1o salsa. Tucson also has a strong, though contested, claim to being the place of origin of the chimichanga.\nTucson is also the birthplace of Chinese Chorizo, a Sino-Mexican fusion dish consisting of pork sausage seasoned with soy sauce, rice wine and chili. This version of chorizo originated from local Chinese grocery stores, which existed from the 1880s to 1970s. Since 2022, the Chinese Chorizo Festival has been held every October, and participants invent new dishes involving the sausage.\nNicknames.\nTucson is commonly known as \"The Old Pueblo\". While the exact origin of this nickname is uncertain, it is commonly traced back to Mayor R. N. \"Bob\" Leatherwood. When rail service was established to the city on March 20, 1880, Leatherwood celebrated the fact by sending telegrams to various leaders, including the President of the United States and the Pope, announcing the \"ancient and honorable pueblo\" of Tucson was now connected by rail to the outside world. The term became popular with newspaper writers who often abbreviated it as \"A. and H. Pueblo\". This in turn transformed into the current form of \"The Old Pueblo\".\nIn the early 1980s, city leaders ran a contest searching for a new nickname. The winning entry was the \"Sunshine Factory\". The new nickname never gained popular acceptance, allowing the old name to remain in common use. Tucson was dubbed \"Optics Valley\" in 1992 when \"Business Week\" ran a cover story on the Arizona Optics Industry Association.\nSports.\nTucson is not represented in any of the five major sports leagues of the United States: the NFL, MLB, the NBA, the NHL, or MLS.\nThe University of Arizona's athletic teams, most notably the men's basketball, football, baseball, and softball teams, have strong local interest. The men's basketball team, formerly coached by Hall of Fame head coach Lute Olson and currently coached by Tommy Lloyd, made 25 straight NCAA Tournaments appearances (1985\u20132009) and won the 1997 National Championship. Arizona's softball team has reached the NCAA National Championship game 12 times and has won 8 times, most recently in 2007. Arizona's baseball team won NCAA National Championships in 1976, 1980, 1986, and 2012. The university's swim teams have gained international recognition, with swimmers coming from as far as Japan and Africa to train with coach Frank Busch, who has also worked with the U.S. Olympic swim team for numerous years. Both men's and women's swim teams won the 2008 NCAA National Championships.\nIn ice hockey, the Tucson Roadrunners of the American Hockey League began play during the 2016\u20132017 season after relocating to Tucson in 2016. They play at the Tucson Convention Center Arena from October to April, and are the top affiliate of the Utah Mammoth. Between 1975 and 1979, there were three professional ice hockey teams in Tucson. The Tucson Mavericks of the Central Hockey League from 1975 to 1976, the Tucson Icemen of the Southwest Hockey League from 1976 to 1977, and the Tucson Rustlers of the Pacific Hockey League from 1978 to 1979. Later in 1997, the Tucson Gila Monsters were unveiled and played from 1997 to 1999 in the West Coast Hockey League. After the Gila Monsters folded in 1999 a team was announced that were to begin play for the Western Professional Hockey League called the Tucson Scorch they never played a game due to the owner not posting a financial guarantee which was required for a team to begin play in the league.\nIn American football, the Indoor Football League announced in 2018 they were bringing an expansion team to Tucson to play at the Tucson Convention Center's newly renovated Tucson Arena starting in 2019. That team would be announced as the Tucson Sugar Skulls.\nIn baseball, the Tucson Saguaros of the independent Pecos League began play in 2016 and play at the Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium. They won the league in their inaugural season and won two more championships in 2020 and 2021. The Tucson Padres played at Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium from 2011 to 2013. They served as the AAA affiliate of the San Diego Padres. The team, formerly known as the Portland Beavers, temporarily moved to Tucson from Portland while the team awaited a new stadium in Escondido. Legal issues derailed the plans to build the Escondido stadium, so they moved to El Paso, Texas for the 2014 season and onward. Previously, the Tucson Sidewinders, a triple-A affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks from 1998 to 2008, won the Pacific Coast League championship and unofficial AAA championship in 2006. The Sidewinders played at Tucson Electric Park (now called Kino Sports Complex) and were in the Pacific Conference South of the PCL.

Tucson Raceway Park hosts NASCAR-sanctioned auto racing events and is one of only two asphalt short tracks in Arizona. Rillito Downs is an in-town destination on weekends in January and February each year. This historic track held the first organized quarter horse races in the world, and they are still racing there. The racetrack is threatened by development. The Moltacqua racetrack, was another historic horse racetrack on what is now Sabino Canyon Road and Vactor Ranch Trail, but it no longer exists.\nParks and recreation.\nThe city has more than 120 parks, from small and local to larger parks with ballfields, natural areas, lakes, 5 public golf courses, and Reid Park Zoo. The Loop is a popular system of shared-use paths encircling the city primarily along washes and is usually well-separated from traffic. Several scenic parks and points of interest are also nearby, including the Tucson Botanical Gardens, Tohono Chul Park, Saguaro National Park, Sabino Canyon, and Biosphere 2 (just north of the city, near the town of Oracle).\nTumamoc Hill is an active research site maintained by the University of Arizona and Pima County that doubles as a popular walking/running trail. The paved trail on Tumamoc Hill is each way, divided into two parts. The lower half is a much more gradual slope compared to the steep upper half reaching a final elevation of , where it overlooks most of the city of Tucson. The trail attracts around 1,500 visits a day from various demographics of the Tucson area.\nMt. Lemmon is north (by the Catalina Highway) and over above Tucson in the Santa Catalina Mountains in the Coronado National Forest. Outdoor activities in the Catalinas include hiking, mountain biking, birding, rock climbing, picnicking, camping, swimming in mountain stream pools, sky rides at Ski Valley, fishing, and photography. In winter with enough snow, the sky ride converts back to skiing at the southernmost ski resort in the continental United States. Summerhaven, a community near the top of Mt. Lemmon, is also a popular destination.\nThe League of American Bicyclists gave Tucson a gold rating for bicycle friendliness in late April 2007. Tucson hosts the largest perimeter cycling event in the United States. The ride, called \"El Tour de Tucson\", takes place each November on the Saturday before Thanksgiving. El Tour de Tucson produced and promoted by Perimeter Bicycling has had as many as 10,000 participants from all over the world. In 2019, ridership is expected to be 6,000 cyclists. Tucson is one of only nine cities in the U.S. to receive a gold rating or higher for cycling friendliness from the League of American Bicyclists. The city is known for its winter cycling opportunities, with teams and riders from around the world spending a portion of the year training in Tucson's year-round biking climate. Popular mountain biking areas include Tucson Mountain Park, Sweetwater Preserve, the Tortolita Mountain trail systems, and Fantasy Island. Road cyclists take on Catalina Highway's steep climb year-round.\nGovernment.\nPima County supported John Kerry 53% to 47% in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election, and Barack Obama 54% to 46% in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election. In the latter year, Pima was the only county to vote against Arizona's gay marriage ban. In 2013, Tucson became the second city in Arizona to approve of civil unions for same-sex partners. The city was the first in the state to pass a domestic partnership registry earlier in 2003.\nIn general, Tucson and Pima County support the Democratic Party, while the state's largest metropolitan area, greater Phoenix, has traditionally supported the Republican Party. Congressional redistricting in 2013, following the publication of the 2010 Census, divided the Tucson area into three Federal Congressional districts (the first, second and third of Arizona). The city center is in the 7th District, represented by Raul Grijalva, a Democrat, from 2003 until his death in 2025, while the more affluent residential areas to the east are in the 6th District, represented by Republican Juan Ciscomani since 2022, and the exurbs north and west between Tucson and Phoenix in the 2nd District are represented by Republican Eli Crane since 2022.\nThe United States Postal Service operates post offices in Tucson. The Tucson Main Post Office is at 1501 South Cherrybell Stravenue.\nCity government.\nTucson follows the \"weak mayor\" model of the council-manager form of local government. The six-member city council holds exclusive legislative authority, and shares executive authority with the mayor, who is elected by the voters independently of the council. An appointed city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city. Tucson is the only city in Arizona that holds officially partisan elections for city offices, with candidates nominated through party primaries.\nBoth the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in August. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on election day the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2017).\nTucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial publicly financed campaigns. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33\u00a2 for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64\u00a2 per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.\nMayor Regina Romero (D) was sworn into office on December 2, 2019, succeeding Jonathan Rothschild (D) who was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding Robert E. Walkup (R), who took office in 1999. Walkup was preceded by George Miller (D), 1991\u20131999; Tom Volgy (D), 1987\u20131991; Lew Murphy (R), 1971\u20131987; and Jim Corbett (D), 1967\u20131971.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nPrimarily, students of the Tucson area attend public schools in the Tucson Unified School District (TUSD). TUSD has the second highest enrollment of any school district in Arizona, behind Mesa Unified School District in the Phoenix metropolitan area. There are also many publicly funded charter schools with a specialized curriculum. Other notable districts include Sunnyside Unified School District, Marana Unified School District, Amphitheater Unified School District, Vail Unified School District, and Flowing Wells Unified School District.\nIn 1956, Tucson High School had the largest enrollment of any secondary school in the United States, with a total of more than 6,800 students. In 2018, Tucson High School enrollment was just over 3,000. \n The facility operated on a two-shift basis while construction went on for two other high schools that opened within a year to educate children in the rapidly booming Tucson population.\nMedia.\nPrint.\nTucson has one daily newspaper, the morning \"Arizona Daily Star\". Wick Communications publishes the daily legal paper \"The Daily Territorial\", while Boulder, Colo.-based 10/13 Communications publishes \"Tucson Weekly\" (an \"alternative\" publication), \"Inside Tucson Business\" and the \"Explorer\". TucsonSentinel.com is a nonprofit independent online news organization. \"Tucson Lifestyle Magazine\", \"Lovin' Life in Tucson\", \"DesertLeaf\", and \"Z\u00f3calo Magazine\" are monthly publications covering arts, architecture, decor, fashion, entertainment, business, history, and other events. The \"Arizona Daily Wildcat\" is the University of Arizona's student newspaper, and the \"Aztec News\" is the Pima Community College student newspaper. \"Catholic Outlook\" is the newspaper for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson, and the \"Arizona Jewish Post\" is the newspaper of the Jewish Federation of Southern Arizona.\nTelevision.\nThe Tucson metro area is served by many local television stations and is the 65th largest designated market area (DMA) in the U.S. with 433,330 homes (0.39% of the total U.S.). It is limited to the three counties of southeastern Arizona (Pima, Santa Cruz, and Cochise)\nThe major television networks serving Tucson are:\nInfrastructure.\nEnergy.\nTucson's primary electrical power source is a natural gas power plant managed by Tucson Electric Power that is within the city limits on the southwestern boundary of Davis-Monthan Air-force base adjacent to Interstate 10. The air pollution generated has raised some concerns as the Sundt operating station has been online since 1962 and is exempt from many pollution standards and controls due to its age.\nSolar has been gaining ground in Tucson with its ideal over 300 days of sunshine climate. Federal, state, and even local utility credits and incentives have also enticed residents to equip homes with solar systems.\nDavis-Monthan AFB has a 3.3 Megawatt (MW) ground-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) array and a 2.7 MW rooftop-mounted PV array, both of which are in the Base Housing area. The base will soon have the largest solar-generating capacity in the United States Department of Defense after awarding a contract on September 10, 2010, to SunEdison to construct a 14.5 MW PV field on the northwestern side of the base.\nGlobal Solar Energy, which is at the University of Arizona's science and technology park, is one of the planet's largest CIGS solar fields at 750 kilowatts.\nLight pollution.\nTucson and Pima County adopted dark sky ordinances to control light pollution in support of the region's astronomical observatories in 1972. Last amended in 2012, the City of Tucson/Pima County Outdoor Lighting Code establishes maximum illumination levels, shielding requirements, and limits on signage in \"continuing support of astronomical activity and minimizing wasted energy, while not compromising the safety, security, and well-being of persons engaged in outdoor nighttime activities.\"\nWater.\nLess than 100 years ago, the Santa Cruz River flowed nearly year-round through Tucson. This supply of water has slowly disappeared, causing Tucson to seek alternative sources.\nIn 1881, water was pumped from a well on the banks of the Santa Cruz River and flowed by gravity through pipes into the distribution system.\nTucson currently draws water from two main sources: Central Arizona Project (CAP) water and groundwater. In 1992, Tucson Water delivered CAP water to some customers that was unacceptable due to discoloration, bad odor and flavor, as well as problems it caused with some customers' plumbing and appliances. Tucson's city water currently consists of CAP water mixed with groundwater.\nIn an effort to conserve water, Tucson is recharging groundwater supplies by running part of its share of CAP water into various open portions of local rivers to seep into their aquifer. Additional study is scheduled to determine how much water is lost through evaporation from the open areas, especially during the summer. The City of Tucson provides reclaimed water to its inhabitants, but it is only used for \"applications such as irrigation, dust control, and industrial uses\". These resources have been in place for more than 27 years, and deliver to over 900 locations.\nTo prevent further loss of groundwater, Tucson has been involved in water conservation and groundwater preservation efforts, shifting away from its reliance on a series of Tucson area wells in favor of conservation, consumption-based pricing for residential and commercial water use, and new wells in the more sustainable Avra Valley aquifer, northwest of the city. An allocation from the Central Arizona Project Aqueduct (CAP), which passes more than across the desert from the Colorado River, has been incorporated into the city's water supply, annually providing over 20 million gallons of \"recharged\" water which is pumped into the ground to replenish water pumped out. Since 2001, CAP water has allowed the city to remove or turn off over 80 wells.\nWater harvesting.\nThe city of Tucson, Arizona provides financial incentives for residents to harvest their rainwater. Tucson's water supply, like many Western cities, is drawn from two main sources: surface water that is pumped more than from the Colorado River and groundwater. The pump expends a significant amount of energy and the Colorado River is diminishing as a result of climate change and overuse.\nIn 2012, the city began a program that rebates residents as much as $2,000 for the purchase of water harvesting systems. \"Water harvesting\" refers to rainwater, which is gathered from building surfaces, and stormwater\",\" which collects nonpotable storm runoff from streets and earth. The program is financed by a water bill fee of 10 cents per 748 gallons of city water used. In the first few years, the rebate program was not conserving water as efficiently as they anticipated. But in fiscal year 2018\u20132019, the rebate program saved 52.1 million gallons of water. That is enough water to meet the annual usage of 160 households. The city has been trying to grow the approximately 250 people who obtain active rebates each year by introducing a loan program to bring rebates within reach of lower-income residents.\nThe city government has an ambitious goal to be carbon neutral by 2030 and is integrating changes that will help change local resident's conventional thinking and practices. On May 1, 2020, Tucson began charging residents and businesses within city limits a monthly Green Stormwater Infrastructure fee (13 cents per 748 gallons of city water used), which is projected to raise some $3\u00a0million a year for public stormwater capture installations and other projects. But this comes at a time when unemployment is rising and the number of low income residents facing unaffordable bills between 2010 and 2018 doubled to 46% as the average bill increased by 119% in Tucson. Additionally, as part of the citywide climate resiliency effort, Mayor Regina Romero recently announced the planting of a million trees over the next decade.\nTransportation.\nPublic transit.\nTucson's Sun Tran bus system serves greater Tucson with standard, express, regional shuttle, and on-demand shuttle bus service. It was awarded Best Transit System in 1988 and 2005. A streetcar line, Sun Link, connects the University of Arizona campus with 4th Avenue, downtown, and the Mercado District west of Interstate 10 and the Santa Cruz River. Ten-minute headway passenger service began July 25, 2014. The streetcar uses Sun Tran's card payment and transfer system, connecting with the University of Arizona's CatTran shuttles, Amtrak, and Greyhound intercity bus service. Sun Tran has been fare-free since the spring of 2020. Initially this change was made to limit contact between riders and drivers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the city council voted to eliminate fares indefinitely in 2023.\nRail.\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Tucson three times weekly in both directions, operating its \"Sunset Limited\" between Los Angeles, California and New Orleans, Louisiana; and \"Texas Eagle\" service between Los Angeles and Chicago, Illinois.\nAirport.\nTucson International Airport (), is south of the city's center. TIA is the second-largest commercial airport in Arizona (behind Sky Harbor in Phoenix), providing nonstop flights to 15 destinations throughout the United States. In addition to passenger and freight service, TIA supports the 162nd Fighter Wing's fleet of seventy F-16s stationed at the Tucson Air National Guard Base. There are two general aviation reliever airports in the area. The city of Tucson operates Ryan Airfield southwest of the city center, and the town of Marana operates Marana Regional Airport to the northwest. Pinal Airpark is also within the metropolitan area.\nRoadways.\nThere are two Interstate highways in the metropolitan area. Interstate 10 runs southeast from Phoenix through Marana, passes west of downtown, and continues east toward El Paso. Interstate 19 leaves the I-10 south of downtown and heads south to the Mexican border. Arizona State Route 210 is a shorter expressway that links downtown with Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and Tucson's southeast side. Tucson does not have a beltway system, and relies almost entirely on surface streets.\nFreeways and state highways in Tucson include:\nCycling.\nCycling is popular in Tucson. Tucson and Pima County maintain an extensive network of marked bike routes, signal crossings, on-street bike lanes, mountain-biking trails, and dedicated shared-use paths. The Loop is a network of seven linear parks, built mainly along river beds, comprising of paved, vehicle-free trails that encircles the majority of the city with links to Marana and Oro Valley. The Tucson\u2013Pima County Bicycle Advisory Committee (TPCBAC) serves in an advisory capacity to local governments on issues relating to bicycle recreation, transportation, and safety. The League of American Bicyclists awarded Tucson a gold rating for bicycle-friendliness in 2006.\nSister cities.\nTucson's sister cities are:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57183", "revid": "461300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57183", "title": "Middleware (distributed applications)", "text": "Provides services for the various components of a distributed systemMiddleware in the context of distributed applications is software that constraint services beyond those provided by the operating system to enable the various components of a distributed system to communicate and manage data. Middleware supports and simplifies complex distributed applications. It includes web servers, application servers, messaging and similar tools that support application development and delivery. Middleware is especially integral to modern information technology based on XML, SOAP, Web services, and service-oriented architecture.\nMiddleware often enables interoperability between applications that run on different operating systems, by supplying services so the application can exchange data in a standards-based way. Middleware sits \"in the middle\" between application software that may be working on different operating systems. It is similar to the middle layer of a three-tier single system architecture, except that it is stretched across multiple systems or applications. Examples include EAI software, telecommunications software, transaction monitors, and messaging-and-queueing software.\nThe distinction between operating system and middleware functionality is, to some extent, arbitrary. While core kernel functionality can only be provided by the operating system itself, some functionality previously provided by separately sold middleware is now integrated in operating systems. A typical example is the TCP/IP stack for telecommunications, nowadays included virtually in every operating system.\nDefinitions.\nMiddleware is defined as software that provides a link between separate software applications. It is sometimes referred to as plumbing because it connects two applications and passes data between them. Middleware allows data contained in one database to be accessed through another. This makes it particularly useful for enterprise application integration and data integration tasks.\nIn more abstract terms, middleware is \"The software layer that lies between the operating system and applications on each side of a distributed computing system in a network.\"\nOrigins.\nMiddleware gained popularity in the 1980s as a solution to the problem of how to link newer applications to older legacy systems, although the term had been in use since 1968. It also facilitated distributed processing, the connection of multiple applications to create a larger application, usually over a network.\nUse.\nMiddleware services provide a more functional set of application programming interfaces to allow an application to:\nwhen compared to the operating system and network services.\nMiddleware offers some unique technological advantages for business and industry. For example, traditional database systems are usually deployed in closed environments where users access the system only via a restricted network or intranet (e.g., an enterprise\u2019s internal network). With the phenomenal growth of the World Wide Web, users can access virtually any database for which they have proper access rights from anywhere in the world. Middleware addresses the problem of varying levels of interoperability among different database structures. Middleware facilitates transparent access to legacy database management systems (DBMSs) or applications via a web server without regard to database-specific characteristics.\nBusinesses frequently use middleware applications to link information from departmental databases, such as payroll, sales, and accounting, or databases housed in multiple geographic locations. In the highly competitive healthcare community, laboratories make extensive use of middleware applications for data mining, laboratory information system (LIS) backup, and to combine systems during hospital mergers. Middleware helps bridge the gap between separate LISs in a newly formed healthcare network following a hospital buyout.\nMiddleware can help software developers avoid having to write application programming interfaces (API) for every control program, by serving as an independent programming interface for their applications.\nFor Future Internet network operation through traffic monitoring in multi-domain scenarios, using mediator tools (middleware) is a powerful help since they allow operators, searchers and service providers to supervise Quality of service and analyse eventual failures in telecommunication services.\nFinally, e-commerce uses middleware to assist in handling rapid and secure transactions over many different types of computer environments. In short, middleware has become a critical element across a broad range of industries, thanks to its ability to bring together resources across dissimilar networks or computing platforms.\nIn 2004 members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) carried out a study of Middleware with respect to system integration in broadcast environments. This involved system design engineering experts from 10 major European broadcasters working over a 12-month period to understand the effect of predominantly software-based products to media production and broadcasting system design techniques. The resulting reports Tech 3300 and Tech 3300s were published and are freely available from the EBU web site.\nTypes.\nMessage-oriented middleware.\nMessage-oriented middleware (MOM) is middleware where transactions or event notifications are delivered between disparate systems or components by way of messages, often via an enterprise messaging system. With MOM, messages sent to the client are collected and stored until they are acted upon, while the client continues with other processing.\n An enterprise messaging system is a type of middleware that facilitates message passing between disparate systems or components in standard formats, often using XML, SOAP or web services. As part of an enterprise messaging system, message broker software may queue, duplicate, translate and deliver messages to disparate systems or components in a messaging system.\n Enterprise service bus (ESB) is defined by the Burton Group as \"some type of integration middleware product that supports both message-oriented middleware and Web services\".\nIntelligent middleware.\nIntelligent Middleware (IMW) provides real-time intelligence and event management through intelligent agents. The IMW manages the real-time processing of high volume sensor signals and turns these signals into intelligent and actionable business information. The actionable information is then delivered in end-user power dashboards to individual users or is pushed to systems within or outside the enterprise. It is able to support various heterogeneous types of hardware and software and provides an API for interfacing with external systems. It should have a highly scalable, distributed architecture which embeds intelligence throughout the network to transform raw data systematically into actionable and relevant knowledge. It can also be packaged with tools to view and manage operations and build advanced network applications most effectively.\nContent-centric middleware.\nContent-centric middleware offers a simple \"provider-consumer\" abstraction through which applications can issue requests for uniquely identified content, without worrying about where or how it is obtained. Juno is one example, which allows applications to generate content requests associated with high-level delivery requirements. The middleware then adapts the underlying delivery to access the content from sources that are best suited to matching the requirements. This is therefore similar to Publish/subscribe middleware, as well as the Content-centric networking paradigm.\n Remote procedure call middleware enables a client to use services running on remote systems. The process can be synchronous or asynchronous.\n With object request broker middleware, it is possible for applications to send objects and request services in an object-oriented system.\n is middleware between applications and database servers.\n Embedded middleware provides communication services and software/firmware integration interface that operates between embedded applications, the embedded operating system, and external applications.\nPolicy Appliances.\nPolicy appliance is a generic term referring to any form of middleware that manages policy rules. They can mediate between data owners or producers, data aggregators, and data users. Among heterogeneous institutional systems or networks they may be used to enforce, reconcile, and monitor agreed information management policies and laws across systems (or between jurisdictions) with divergent information policies or needs. Policy appliances can interact with smart data (data that carries with it contextual relevant terms for its own use), intelligent agents (queries that are self-credentialed, authenticating, or contextually adaptive), or context-aware applications to control information flows, protect security and confidentiality, and maintain privacy. Policy appliances support policy-based information management processes by enabling rules-based processing, selective disclosure, and accountability and oversight. \nExamples of policy appliance technologies for rules-based processing include analytic filters, contextual search, semantic programs, labeling and wrapper tools, and DRM, among others; policy appliance technologies for selective disclosure include anonymization, content personalization, subscription and publishing tools, among others; and, policy appliance technologies for accountability and oversight include authentication, authorization, immutable and non-repudiable logging, and audit tools, among others. \nOther.\nOther sources include these additional classifications:\nVendors.\nIBM, Red Hat, Oracle Corporation and Microsoft are some of the vendors that provide middleware software. Vendors such as Axway, SAP, TIBCO, Informatica, Objective Interface Systems, Pervasive, ScaleOut Software and webMethods were specifically founded to provide more niche middleware solutions. Groups such as the Apache Software Foundation, OpenSAF, the ObjectWeb Consortium (now OW2) and OASIS' AMQP encourage the development of open source middleware. Microsoft .NET \"Framework\" architecture is essentially \"Middleware\" with typical middleware functions distributed between the various products, with most inter-computer interaction by industry standards, open APIs or RAND software licence. Solace provides middleware in purpose-built hardware for implementations that may experience scale. StormMQ provides Message Oriented Middleware as a service.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was sited southwest of the modern city of St Albans in Hertfordshire, England. The major ancient Roman route Watling Street passed through the city, but was realigned in medieval times to bring trade to St Albans. It was about a day's walk from London.\nA large portion of the Roman city remains unexcavated, being now park and agricultural land, although due to ploughing on the privately owned agricultural half of the city a lot of damage has been done, as proven by parts of mosaic floors that have been found on the surface, and results of ground penetrating radar show outlines of buildings as smudges rather than clearly defined walls like those protected by the parkland. \nPart of the Roman city has been built upon, such as the small settlement around the Anglo-Saxon St Michael's Church. Much of the site and its environs is now a scheduled monument.\nHistory.\nBefore the Romans established their settlement, there was already a tribal centre in the area which belonged to the Catuvellauni. This settlement is usually called Verlamion. The etymology is uncertain but the name has been reconstructed as *\"Uerul\u0101mion\", which would have a meaning like \"[the tribe or settlement] of the broad hand\" (\"Uerul\u0101mos\") in Brittonic. In this pre-Roman form, it was among the first places in Britain recorded by name. The settlement was established by Tasciovanus, who minted coins there.\nThe Roman settlement was granted the rank of \"municipium\" around AD\u00a050, meaning its citizens had what were known as \"Latin Rights\", a lesser citizenship status than a possessed. It grew to a significant town, and as such received the attentions of Boudica of the Iceni in 61, when Verulamium was sacked and burnt on her orders: a black ash layer has been recorded by archaeologists, thus confirming the Roman written record. The rebuilt town grew steadily; by the early 3rd century, it covered an area of about , behind a deep ditch and wall. It is the location of the martyrdom of the first British martyr saint, Saint Alban, who was a Roman patrician converted by the priest Amphibalus.\nVerulamium contained a forum, basilica and a theatre, much of which were damaged during two fires, one in 155 and the other in around 250. One of the few extant Roman inscriptions in Britain was found in the remnants of the forum (see Verulamium Forum inscription). The town was rebuilt in stone rather than timber at least twice over the next 150 years. Occupation by the Romans ended between AD 400 and 450.\nRemains of the Roman period.\nAs well as the items in the museum, there are a few remains of the Roman city visible, including\nAlthough there are other Roman theatres in Britain (for example at Camulodunum), the one at Verulamium has been claimed to be the only full excavated example of its kind, being a theatre with a stage rather than an amphitheatre. The theatre is on the grounds of and therefore run by the Gorhambury Estate.\nMore remains under the nearby agricultural land which have never been excavated were for a while seriously threatened by deep ploughing.\nAlthough recent results of GPR ( ground penetrating radar) have revealed more damage than originally thought has been done to most buildings, especially the north western part of the old Roman city.\nVerulamium is mentioned in a Latin inscription on a wax tablet, dated to AD 62, discovered in London during the Bloomberg excavations, 2010\u201314:\nIn the consulship of Publius Marius Celsus and Lucius Afinius Gallus, on the 12th day before the Kalends of November (21 October AD 62). I, Marcus Rennius Venustus, (have written and say that) I have contracted with Gaius Valerius Proculus that he bring from Verulamium by the Ides of November (13 November) 20 loads of provisions at a transport-charge of one-quarter denarius for each, on condition that \u2026 one as \u2026 to London; but if \u2026 the whole \u2026\nPost-Roman times.\nSt Albans Abbey and the associated Anglo-Saxon settlement were founded on a hill outside the Roman city. The site of the abbey may have been a location where there was reason to believe that St Alban was executed or buried. More certainly, the abbey is near the site of a Roman cemetery, which, as was normal in Roman times, was outside the city walls. It is unknown whether there are Roman remains under the medieval abbey. An archaeological excavation in 1978, directed by Martin Biddle, failed to find Roman remains on the site of the medieval chapter house.\nDavid Nash Ford identifies the community as the \"Cair Mincip\" (\"Fort Municipium\") listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Britain in his \"History of the Britons\". As late as the eighth century the Saxon inhabitants of St Albans nearby were aware of their ancient neighbour, which they knew alternatively as \"Verulamac\u00e6stir\" or, under what H. R. Loyn terms \"their own hybrid\", \"Vaeclingsc\u00e6stir\", \"the fortress of the followers of W\u00e6cla\".\nLoss and recovery.\nThe city was quarried for building material for the construction of medieval St Albans; indeed, much of the Norman abbey was constructed from the remains of the Roman city, with Roman brick and stone visible. The modern city takes its name from Alban, either a citizen of \"Verulamium\" or a Roman soldier, who was condemned to death in the 3rd century for sheltering Amphibalus, a Christian. Alban was converted by him to Christianity, and by virtue of his death, Alban became the first British Christian martyr.\nSince much of the modern city and its environs are built over Roman remains, it is still common to unearth Roman artefacts several miles away. A complete tile kiln was found in Park Street some from Verulamium in the 1970s, and there is a Roman mausoleum near Rothamsted Park away.\nWithin the walls of ancient \"Verulamium\", the Elizabethan philosopher, essayist and statesman Sir Francis Bacon built a \"refined small house\" called Verulam House that was thoroughly described by the 17th century diarist John Aubrey. No trace of it is left, but Aubrey noted, \"At Verulam is to be seen, in some few places, some remains of the wall of this [Roman] Citie\".\nMoreover, when Bacon was ennobled in 1618, he took the title Baron Verulam after \"Verulamium\". The barony became extinct after he died without heirs in 1626.\nThis title was revived in 1790 for James Grimston, a Hertfordshire politician. He was later made Earl of Verulam, a title still held by his descendants.\nVerulamium Museum.\nThe Verulamium Museum, part of St Albans Museums, is on a site once occupied by the forum. It is now on the edge of Verulamium Park.\nThe museum contains much information about the town, both as a Roman and Iron Age settlement, plus Roman history in general. It was established following the excavations carried out by Mortimer Wheeler and his wife, Tessa Wheeler, during the 1930s.\nIt is run by the district council.\nCollections.\nIt is noted for the large and colourful mosaics and many other artefacts, such as pottery, jewellery, tools and coins, from the Roman period. Many items were found in formal excavations, but some, including the Verulamium Forum inscription and a coffin still containing a male skeleton, were unearthed nearby during building work.\nOther.\nThe asteroid 4206 Verulamium was named in honour of the ancient city.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the lead singer and one of the founder members of the Rolling Stones. Jagger has co-written most of the band's songs with lead guitarist Keith Richards; their songwriting partnership is one of the most successful in rock music history. His career has spanned more than six decades, and he has been widely described as one of the most popular and influential front men in the history of rock music. His distinctive voice and energetic live performances, along with Richards's guitar style, have been the Rolling Stones' trademark throughout the band's career. Early in his career, Jagger gained notoriety for his romantic involvements and illicit drug use, and has often been portrayed as a countercultural figure.\nJagger was born and grew up in Dartford. He studied at the London School of Economics before abandoning his studies to focus on his career with the Rolling Stones. In the early 1970s, Jagger starred in the films \"Performance\" (1970) and \"Ned Kelly\" (1970), to mixed receptions. Beginning in the 1980s, he released a number of solo works, including four albums and the single \"Dancing in the Street\", a 1985 duet with David Bowie that reached No.\u00a01 in the UK and Australia and was a top-ten hit in other countries.\nIn the 2000s, Jagger co-founded a film production company, Jagged Films, and produced feature films through the company beginning with the 2001 historical drama \"Enigma\". He was also a member of the supergroup SuperHeavy from 2009 to 2011. Although relationships with his bandmates, particularly Richards, deteriorated during the 1980s, Jagger has always found more success with the Rolling Stones than with his solo and side projects. He was married to Bianca P\u00e9rez-Mora Macias from 1971 to 1978, and has had several other relationships; he has eight children with five women.\nIn 1989, Jagger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and, in 2004, into the UK Music Hall of Fame with the Rolling Stones. As a member of the Rolling Stones and as a solo artist, he reached No.\u00a01 on the UK and US singles charts with 13 singles, the top 10 with 32 singles and the top 40 with 70 singles. In 2003, he was knighted for his services to popular music. Jagger is credited with being a trailblazer in pop music and with bringing a style and sex appeal to rock and roll that have been imitated and proven influential with subsequent generations of musicians.\nEarly life and education.\nMichael Philip Jagger was born into a middle-class family in Dartford, Kent, on 26\u00a0July 1943. His father, Basil Fanshawe \"Joe\" Jagger, was a gymnast and physical education teacher who helped popularise basketball in Britain. His paternal grandfather, David Ernest Jagger, was also a teacher. His mother, Eva Ensley Mary (\"n\u00e9e\" Scutts), born in Sydney of English descent, was a hairdresser who was politically active in the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom. His parents were married in 1940 at Holy Trinity Church in Dartford. Jagger's younger brother, Chris (born 19\u00a0December 1947), is also a musician, and the two have performed together.\nAlthough he was encouraged to follow his father's career path growing up, Jagger has said, \"I always sang as a child. I was one of those kids who just liked to sing. Some kids sing in choirs; others like to show off in front of the mirror. I was in the church choir and I also loved listening to singers on the radio\u2014the BBC or Radio Luxembourg\u2014or watching them on TV and in the movies.\"\nIn September 1950, Keith Richards and Jagger first met as classmates at Wentworth Primary School in Dartford, prior to the Jagger family's 1954 move to Wilmington, Kent. The same year he passed the eleven-plus examination and attended Dartford Grammar School, which now has the Mick Jagger Centre performing arts venue. Jagger and Richards lost contact with each other when they went to different schools.\nIn the mid-1950s, Jagger began his music career, forming a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor. They played songs by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin' Wolf, and Bo Diddley. Jagger met Richards again on 17 October 1961 on Platform Two of Dartford railway station. The Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records Jagger was carrying revealed a shared interest in rhythm and blues. A musical partnership began shortly afterwards. Richards and Taylor often met Jagger at his house. In late 1961, the meetings moved to Taylor's house, where Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith joined the trio. The quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.\nJagger left school in 1961 after passing seven O-levels and two A-levels. He and Richards moved into a flat at Edith Grove in Chelsea, London, with guitarist Brian Jones. While Richards and Jones planned to start their own rhythm and blues group, Jagger continued to study finance and accounting on a government grant as an undergraduate student at the London School of Economics. He had seriously considered becoming either a journalist or a politician, comparing the latter to a pop star.\nBrian Jones, using the name Elmo Lewis, began working at the Ealing Club, where a loose music ensemble known as Blues Incorporated was performing, under the leadership of Alexis Korner. Jones, Richards, and Jagger began playing with the group, with Jagger eventually becoming the band's lead singer. Jones, Richards, and Jagger began meeting on their own to practise, establishing the foundation for what would become the Rolling Stones.\nCareer.\n1960s.\nAt the beginning of the Rolling Stones' founding in the early 1960s, the band mostly played for no money at a basement club opposite London's Ealing Broadway tube station, which was subsequently named Ferry's Club. The group had very little equipment and borrowed Korner's gear to play. Their first appearance, under the name the Rollin' Stones, after one of their favourite Muddy Waters songs, was performed at the Marquee Club, a London jazz club, on 12\u00a0July 1962. They later changed their name to the Rolling Stones, since it seemed more formal.\nThe initial band members included Jagger, Richards, Jones, Ian Stewart on piano, Dick Taylor on bass, and Tony Chapman on drums, but Richards wrote in \"Life\", his memoir, that, \"The drummer that night was Mick Avory\u2014not Tony Chapman, as history has mysteriously handed it down\u00a0...\". In June 1963, the band began a five-month residency at Eel Pie Island Hotel, which the BBC later credited with shaping the band's career. That autumn, Jagger left the London School of Economics to pursue a musical career with the Rolling Stones.\nThe group initially played songs by American rhythm and blues artists, including Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. The band's first two UK No.\u00a01 hits were cover versions, \"It's All Over Now\" by Bobby Womack and \"Little Red Rooster\" by Willie Dixon. Encouraged by manager Andrew Loog Oldham, Jagger and Richards soon began writing their own songs. Their songwriting partnership took time to develop; one of their early compositions was \"As Tears Go By\", a song written for Marianne Faithfull, a young singer Loog Oldham was promoting.\nFor the Rolling Stones, the duo wrote \"The Last Time\", the group's third No.\u00a01 single in the UK, based on \"This May Be the Last Time\", a traditional Negro spiritual song recorded by the Staple Singers in 1955. Jagger and Richards also wrote their first international hit, \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". It established the Rolling Stones' image as defiant troublemakers in contrast to the Beatles as \"lovable moptop[s]\". Jagger told Stephen Schiff in a 1992 \"Vanity Fair\" profile: I wasn't trying to be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything. I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from suburbia who sings in this band, but someone older might have thought it was just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and where are we going if this is music?\u00a0... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame.\nThe group's early albums, including \"Out of Our Heads\", \"Aftermath\", and \"Between the Buttons\", were successful commercially. In 1967, Jagger, Richards, and Jones were hounded by authorities over their recreational drug use after the \"News of the World\" published a three-part feature, \"Pop Stars and Drugs: Facts That Will Shock You\". The feature described alleged LSD parties hosted by the Moody Blues and attended by the Who's Pete Townshend and Cream's Ginger Baker, and alleged admissions of drug use by leading pop musicians. The first article targeted Donovan, who was raided and charged soon after the feature aired. The second instalment, published on 5 February, targeted the Rolling Stones.\nA reporter who contributed to the story spent an evening at the London club Blaise's, where a member of the Rolling Stones allegedly took several Benzedrine tablets, displayed a piece of hashish, and invited his companions back to his flat for a \"smoke\". The article claimed this was Mick Jagger, but it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity; the reporter had been eavesdropping on Brian Jones. Two days after the article was published, Jagger filed a writ for libel against the \"News of the World\".\nJagger and Richards were later arrested on drug charges and given unusually harsh sentences. Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy, and Richards was sentenced to one year in prison for allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property. The traditionally conservative editor of \"The Times\", William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences. On appeal, Richards's sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge, although he spent one night in London's Brixton Prison. The Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade.\nBy the release of the Stones' album \"Beggars Banquet\", Brian Jones was contributing only sporadically to the band. Jagger said Jones was \"not psychologically suited to this way of life\". His drug use became a hindrance, and he could not obtain a US visa. Richards reported that when Jagger, Watts, and he were at Jones's house in June 1969, Jones admitted he was unable to \"go on the road again\". Jones left the band, saying, \"I've left, and if I want to I can come back\". On 3\u00a0July 1969, less than a month later, Jones drowned in the swimming pool at his home, Cotchford Farm, in Hartfield, East Sussex. When asked if he felt guilty about Jones's death, Jagger told \"Rolling Stone\" in 1995:\nNo, I don't really. I do feel that I behaved in a very childish way, but we were very young, and in some ways we picked on him. But, unfortunately, he made himself a target for it; he was very, very jealous, very difficult, very manipulative, and if you do that in this kind of a group of people you get back as good as you give, to be honest. I wasn't understanding enough about his drug addiction. No one seemed to know much about drug addiction. Things like LSD were all new. No one knew the harm. People thought cocaine was good for you.\nOn 5\u00a0July 1969, two days after Jones's death, the Rolling Stones played a previously scheduled concert at Hyde Park, attended by 250,000 people, dedicating it as a tribute to Jones. It was their first concert with new guitarist, Mick Taylor, who replaced Jones. At the beginning of the Hyde Park concert, Jagger read an excerpt from Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem \"Adona\u00efs\", an elegy written on the death of John Keats, after which thousands of butterflies were released in Jones's memory. The band began the concert with \"I'm Yours and I'm Hers\", a song by Johnny Winter. During the concert, they band played three new songs from two forthcoming albums, \"Midnight Rambler\" and \"Love in Vain\", from \"Let It Bleed\", released in December 1969, and \"Loving Cup\", which appeared on \"Exile on Main St.\", released May 1972. They also played \"Honky Tonk Women\", released as a single the previous day.\nOn 6 December 1969, the Stones performed at the Altamont Free Concert music festival, in which Meredith Hunter was stabbed to death by a member of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club after drawing a revolver and approaching the stage, which was seen as a threat to the band. Accounts of Hunter's reasoning for drawing the revolver were mixed. According to \"The Guardian\" music editor Ben Beaumont-Thomas, Hunter's death and the overall mood of festival goers \"has become symbolic for the corruption of 1960s hippy idealism\". Jagger later recalled to Robert Greenfield that he was \"scared shitless\" that, according to \"Rolling Stone\", \"he might be attacked on stage\" by Hells Angels members who \"felt they had been unfairly blamed for the disaster that left a Stones fan dead\".\n1970s.\nIn 1970, Jagger bought Stargroves, a manor house and estate near East Woodhay in Hampshire. The Rolling Stones and several other bands recorded there using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. In 1970, Nicolas Roeg's film \"Performance\", produced in 1968 and featuring Jagger, was released. In the film, Jagger plays the role of Turner, a reclusive rock star. Keith Richards's girlfriend Anita Pallenberg also appeared in the film.\nDuring a 1970 concert in Paris, Jagger called for the release of imprisoned French Maoists.\nJagger and the rest of the Rolling Stones moved to Southern France as tax exiles in early 1971 to avoid paying a 93 per cent supertax imposed by Harold Wilson's Labour government on the country's top earners. Jagger moved into a chateau near Biot in April 1971, days before the new tax year. After the band's acrimonious split with their second manager, Allen Klein, in 1971, and Richards's heroin addiction, Jagger assumed control of the band's business affairs, leading to feuds between Jagger and Richards. Jagger has managed the group ever since, with Prince Rupert Loewenstein acting as business adviser and financial manager from 1968 until 2007.\nJagger and the rest of the band changed their look and style as the 1970s progressed. While in France, Jagger learned to play guitar and contributed guitar parts for songs on \"Sticky Fingers\" (1971) and the Stones' subsequent albums except \"Dirty Work\" in 1986. For the Rolling Stones' highly publicised 1972 American tour, Jagger wore glam-rock clothing and glitter makeup on stage. Their interest in the blues had been made manifest on the 1972 album \"Exile on Main St.\" Music critic Russell Hall described Jagger's emotional singing on the gospel-influenced \"Let It Loose\", which appears on \"Exile on Main St.\", as the singer's best vocal achievement.\nIn 1972, Jagger, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman, Nicky Hopkins, and Ry Cooder released \"Jamming with Edward!\", an album recorded during the band's \"Let It Bleed\" sessions. The album includes loose jams recorded while the rest of the Stones (reportedly) were waiting for Keith Richards to return to the studio.\nIn November 1972, the band began recording sessions in Kingston, Jamaica, for the album \"Goats Head Soup\", which was released in 1973 and reached No.\u00a01 in both the UK and US. The album includes the song \"Angie\", a global hit that was the first in a string of commercially successful singles to emerge from tepidly received studio albums. The sessions for \"Goats Head Soup\" produced unused material, including \"Waiting on a Friend\", a ballad that was not released until the \"Tattoo You\" LP nine years later.\nAnother legal battle over drugs, dating back to their stay in France, interrupted the making of \"Goats Head Soup\". Authorities issued a warrant for Richards's arrest, and the other band members returned briefly to France for questioning related to the incident. Along with Jagger's 1967 and 1970 convictions on drug charges, this complicated the band's plans for their Pacific tour in early 1973. The band was denied permission to play in Japan and was nearly banned from playing in Australia. A European tour followed in September and October 1973, which bypassed France after Richards's arrest in England on drug charges.\nThe 1974 album \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\" was recorded in the Musicland Studios in Munich; it reached No.\u00a02 in the UK and No.\u00a01 in the US. Jagger and Richards produced the album credited as \"the Glimmer Twins\". The album and the single of the same name were both hits.\nFollowing Mick Taylor's exodus from the band in December 1974, the Stones needed a new guitarist. The recording sessions for the next album, \"Black and Blue\" (1976) (No.\u00a02 in the UK, No.\u00a01 in the US), in Munich provided an opportunity for some guitarists hoping to join the band to work while trying out. Several guitarists were auditioned, some without even knowing they were auditioning. Ronnie Wood, then the guitarist of the band Faces was selected and joined the band in 1975. Wood has sometimes functioned as a mediator in the group, especially between Jagger and Richards. His first full-length LP with the band was \"Some Girls\" (1978), on which they ventured into disco and punk, a move primarily led by Jagger.\n1980s.\nFollowing the success of \"Some Girls\", the band released the album \"Emotional Rescue\" in mid-1980. During recording sessions for the album, a rift between Jagger and Richards began developing. Richards wanted to tour in the summer or autumn of 1980 to promote \"Emotional Rescue\", but Jagger declined. \"Emotional Rescue\" hit the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and the title track reached No.\u00a03 in the US.\nIn early 1981, the Rolling Stones reconvened and began touring the US that year, leaving little time to write and record a new album. The band's album \"Tattoo You\", released in 1981, featured several outtakes, including \"Start Me Up\", the album's lead single that reached No.\u00a02 in the US and ranked No.\u00a022 on Billboard's Hot 100 year-end chart. Two songs, \"Waiting on a Friend\" (US No.\u00a013), and \"Tops\", feature Mick Taylor's unused rhythm guitar tracks. Jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins plays on three \"Tattoo You\" songs, \"Slave\", \"Neighbours\", and \"Waiting on a Friend\". The album reached No.\u00a02 in the UK and No.\u00a01 in the US.\nWhile continuing to tour and release albums with the Rolling Stones, Jagger began a solo career. According to a February 1985 article in \"Rolling Stone\", Jagger did so to \"establish an artistic identity for himself apart from the Rolling Stones\" which was described as \"his boldest attempt yet\". Jagger started writing and recording material for his first solo album \"She's the Boss\". Released on 19\u00a0February 1985, the album, produced by Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell, features Herbie Hancock, Jeff Beck, Jan Hammer, Pete Townshend and the Compass Point All Stars. It sold well, and the single \"Just Another Night\" was a Top Ten hit. During this period, he collaborated with the Jacksons on the song \"State of Shock\", sharing lead vocals with Michael Jackson.\nIn 1985, Jagger performed without the Rolling Stones at Live Aid, a multi-venue charity concert in 1985. Jagger performed at Philadelphia's JFK Stadium, where he also performed a duet of \"It's Only Rock and Roll\" with Tina Turner, highlighted by Jagger tearing away Turner's skirt, and a cover of \"Dancing in the Street\" with David Bowie, who was performing at Wembley Stadium in London. The video was shown simultaneously on the screens of both Wembley and JFK Stadiums. The song reached No.\u00a01 in the UK the same year.\nRichards ended his heroin use and became more present in decision-making, but Jagger was not accustomed to Richards's presence and did not like his authority over the band diminished. This led to a feud between Jagger and Richards that has been referred to as \"World War III\" with concern at the time that Jagger touring without the Stones could prove a \"death sentence\" for the band. When the Stones released \"Dirty Work\" in March 1986, Jagger's relations with Richards had reached an all-time low, leading Jagger to refuse to tour with the band to support the new album. Jagger responded, saying: I think that one ought to be allowed to have one's artistic side apart from just being in the Rolling Stones. I love the Rolling Stones\u2014I think it's wonderful, I think it's done a lot of wonderful things for music. But, you know, it cannot be, at my age and after spending all these years, the only thing in my life.\nJagger released his second solo album, \"Primitive Cool\", in 1987. Though it failed to match the commercial success of his debut solo album, it was critically well received. Richards released his first solo album, \"Talk is Cheap\", shortly afterwards. Many felt the respective solo efforts marked the end of the Rolling Stones as a band. In 1988, Jagger produced the songs \"Glamour Boys\" and \"Which Way to America\" on Living Colour's album \"Vivid\". Between 15 and 28\u00a0March, he also performed a solo concert tour in Japan, playing in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka.\nJagger and Richards reunited in the Barbados in 1988 and produced dozens of new songs. Richards recalls:We just started in. And within two days, we realized we had five or six songs happening. I did have to take Mick to a few discos\u2014which are not my favourite places in the world\u2014because Mick likes to go out and dance at night. So I did that. That was my sacrifice. I humoured him. And that's when I knew we could work together.\nRon Wood believes the modest sales of Jagger's \"Primitive Cool\" \"surprised\" Jagger and made him \"realize the strength of the band\". Richards recalled, \"We've been stuffed together for years and one of the consequences of the break was making us realize we were stuck together whether we liked it or not. Jagger said, \"Because we've been doing it for so long, we don't really have to discuss it. When we come up with a lick or a riff or a chorus, we already know if it's right or if it's wrong.\" On 29 August 1989, the band released its 19th UK and 21st US album, \"Steel Wheels\".\n1990s.\nThe 1989\u20131990 Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour was the band's first world tour in seven years and their biggest stage production to date. Opening acts included Living Colour and Guns N' Roses. Recordings from the tour were released in a 1991 concert album, \"Flashpoint\", which reached No.\u00a06 in the UK and No.\u00a016 in the US, and the concert film \"Live at the Max\", released in 1991. The tour was Bill Wyman's last. After years of deliberation, Wyman chose to leave the band, although his departure was not made official until January 1993.\nFollowing the success of \"Steel Wheels\", and the end of Jagger and Richards's well-publicised feud, Jagger attempted to reestablish himself as a solo artist. He acquired Rick Rubin as co-producer in January 1992 for his third solo album, \"Wandering Spirit\". Sessions for the album began that month in Los Angeles and ended nine months later, in September 1992. Richards recorded his second solo studio album, \"Main Offender\", at the same time.\nOn \"Wandering Spirit\", Jagger used Lenny Kravitz as a vocalist on his cover of Bill Withers's \"Use Me\" and bassist Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers on three separate tracks. Jagger signed with Atlantic Records, which had signed the Stones in the 1970s, to distribute the solo album. \"Wandering Spirit\", released in February 1993, and \"The Very Best of Mick Jagger\", a compilation album containing no new material, were both released by Atlantic Records. \"Wandering Spirit\" was commercially successful, reaching No.\u00a012 in the UK and No.\u00a011 in the US.\nIn 1993, the Stones were ready to start recording their next studio album, and Charlie Watts recruited bassist Darryl Jones, a former sideman of Miles Davis and Sting, as Wyman's replacement for the recording of \"Voodoo Lounge\", released in 1994. Jones continued to perform with the band as the band's touring and session bassist. The album was well received critically and proved commercially successful, going double platinum in the US. Reviews of the \"Voodoo Lounge\" noted and credited the album's \"traditionalist\" sounds to the Rolling Stones' new producer Don Was. \"Voodoo Lounge\" won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 1995 Grammy Awards. It reached No.\u00a01 in the UK and No.\u00a02 in the US.\nThe Voodoo Lounge Tour to support \"Voodoo Lounge\" lasted into 1996, grossing $320\u00a0million and becoming the world's highest-grossing tour ever at the time. On 8 September 1994, the Stones performed \"Love Is Strong\", a new song, and \"Start Me Up\" at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The band was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 1994 MTV ceremony.\nThe Rolling Stones ended the 1990s with the album \"Bridges to Babylon\", released in 1997 to mixed reviews. It reached No.\u00a06 in the UK and No.\u00a03 in the US. The music video for the single \"Anybody Seen My Baby?\" featuring Angelina Jolie was played in steady rotation on both MTV and VH1. Sales were roughly equal to those of previous records (about 1.2\u00a0million copies sold in the US). The subsequent Bridges to Babylon Tour, which crossed Europe, North America, and other destinations, proved the band remained a strong live music attraction. Another live album, \"No Security\", was released from the tour. \"No Security\" included all new songs, except \"Live With Me\" and \"The Last Time\", which had been previously unreleased on live albums. The album reached No.\u00a067 in the UK and No.\u00a034 in the US. In 1999, the Rolling Stones staged the No Security Tour in the US and continued the Bridges to Babylon tour in Europe.\n2000s.\nIn 2001, Jagger released his fourth solo album, \"Goddess in the Doorway,\" spawning the single \"Visions of Paradise\", which reached No.\u00a044 in the UK. Following the 11 September attacks, Jagger joined Richards in the Concert for New York City, a benefit concert in response to the terrorist attack, to sing \"Salt of the Earth\" and \"Miss You\".\nFrom 1989 to 2001, according to \"Fortune\", the Stones generated more than US$1.5\u00a0billion in total gross revenue, surpassing the revenue of U2, Bruce Springsteen, and Michael Jackson. Jagger celebrated the Rolling Stones' 40th anniversary by touring with the band on the year-long Licks Tour, supporting the band's commercially successful career retrospective, \"Forty Licks\", a double album. Along with Eurythmics member and record producer David A. Stewart, Jagger wrote and performed the soundtrack to the 2004 romantic comedy \"Alfie\", which included the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song-winning single \"Old Habits Die Hard\". In 2007, the band grossed US$437\u00a0million on A Bigger Bang Tour, earning the band an entry in the 2007 edition of \"Guinness World Records\" for the most lucrative music tour ever. Asked if the band would retire after the tour, Jagger said, \"I'm sure the Rolling Stones will do more things and more records and more tours. We've got no plans to stop any of that really.\"\nTwo years later, in October 2009, Jagger joined U2 to perform \"Gimme Shelter\" with Fergie and will.i.am, and \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" with U2 at the 25th Anniversary Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Concert.\n2010s.\nOn 20 May 2011, Jagger announced the formation of a new supergroup, SuperHeavy, including Dave Stewart, Joss Stone, Damian Marley, and A. R. Rahman. The group started with a phone call Jagger received from Stewart. Stewart had heard three sound systems playing different music at the same time in his home in St Ann's Bay, Jamaica. This gave him the idea of creating a group with Jagger, fusing the musical styles of several artists. After multiple phone calls and deliberation, the other members of the group were decided upon. SuperHeavy released one album and two singles in 2011, reportedly recording 29 songs in ten days. Jagger is featured on will.i.am's 2011 single \"T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)\" along with Jennifer Lopez, officially released to iTunes on 4 February 2012.\nOn 21\u00a0February 2012, Jagger, B. B. King, Buddy Guy and Jeff Beck, and a blues ensemble, performed at the White House concert series before President Barack Obama. When Jagger held out a mic to him, Obama twice sang the line \"Come on, baby don't you want to go\" of the blues cover \"Sweet Home Chicago\", the blues anthem of Obama's hometown. Jagger hosted the season finale of \"Saturday Night Live\" on 19 and 20\u00a0May 2012, doing several comic skits and playing some Rolling Stones' hits with Arcade Fire, Foo Fighters and Jeff Beck.\nJagger performed in with the Rolling Stones on 12\u00a0December 2012. The Stones played the Glastonbury festival in 2013, headlining on Saturday, 29\u00a0June. This was followed by two concerts in London's Hyde Park as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations, their first there since their famous 1969 performance. In 2013, Jagger teamed up with his brother Chris Jagger for two new duets on his album \"Concertina Jack,\" released to mark the 40th anniversary of his debut album. On 7 October 2016, the Stones headlined the first night of the three-day music festival Desert Trip and covered the Beatles' 1969 single \"Come Together\"; Paul McCartney performed the next night. In July 2017, Jagger released the double A-sided single \"Gotta Get a Grip\" / \"England Lost\". They were released as a response to the \"anxiety, unknowability of the changing political situation\" in a post-Brexit UK, according to Jagger. Accompanying music videos were released for both songs.\nIn March 2019, a Rolling Stones tour of the US and Canada from April to June had to be postponed as Jagger needed a transcatheter aortic valve replacement. On 4\u00a0April 2019, it was announced that Jagger had successfully undergone the procedure at NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital, and was in great health. After a six-week delay while Jagger recovered, the No Filter Tour resumed with two performances at Chicago's Soldier Field.\n2020s.\nThe band's 1973 album \"Goats Head Soup\" was reissued in September 2020 and featured previously unreleased outtakes, such as \"Scarlet\", featuring Jimmy Page. The album topped the UK Albums Chart as the Rolling Stones became the first band to top the chart across six different decades.\nThe Rolling Stones\u2014featuring Jagger, Richards, Watts and Wood at their homes\u2014were one of the headline acts on Global Citizen's \"One World: Together at Home\" on-line and on-screen concert on 18 April 2020, a global event featuring dozens of artists and comedians to support frontline healthcare workers and the World Health Organization during the COVID-19 pandemic. Five days later, they released \"Living in a Ghost Town\", a new Rolling Stones' single recorded in London and Los Angeles in 2019 and finished in isolation (part of the new material that the band were recording in the studio before the COVID-19 lockdown), a song that the band \"thought would resonate through the times we're living in\" and their first release of original material since 2012. The song reached No.\u00a01 on the German Singles Chart, the first time the Stones had reached the top spot in 52 years, and making them the oldest artists ever to do so.\nIn August 2021, it was announced that Charlie Watts would undergo an unspecified medical procedure and would not perform on the remainder of the No Filter tour; the longtime Stones associate Steve Jordan filled in as drummer. Watts died at a London hospital on 24 August 2021, at the age of 80, with his family around him. Jagger, Richards and Wood paid tribute to him, along with former bandmate Wyman. It was discussed whether the band would continue, and they opted to carry on as it was what \"Charlie wanted us to do\". During their first show after Watts's death, Jagger told the crowd:It's a bit of a poignant night for us. Because this is our first tour in 59 years that we've done without our lovely Charlie Watts. We all miss Charlie so much. We miss him as a band. We miss him as friends, on and off the stage. We've got so many memories of Charlie. I'm sure some of you that have seen us before have got memories of Charlie as well. And I hope you'll remember him like we do. So we'd like to dedicate this show to Charlie.In a May 2022 interview, Jagger stated \"I don't really expect him to be there any more if I turn round during a show. But I do think about him. Not only during rehearsals or on stage, but in other ways too.\" On the one-year anniversary of Watts's death, Jagger shared what \"Rolling Stone\" described as a \"moving tribute\" on social media, which included a voiceover by Jagger backed with \"Till the Next Goodbye\". That same year, Jagger co-wrote and performed \"Strange Game\" for the television series \"Slow Horses\" after being emailed \"out of the blue\" by composer Daniel Pemberton, whom he did not know; it was subsequently nominated for an Emmy award. That June, two shows scheduled in the Stones' Sixty tour were postponed after Jagger contracted COVID-19. The tour resumed following Jagger's recovery in late June. Jagger launched his own line of harmonicas the following January in collaboration with whynow Music and Lee Oskar, expressing a desire to encourage younger musicians to take up the instrument.\nRelationship with Keith Richards.\nJagger's songwriting partnership with Richards is one of the most successful in history. His relationship with Richards is frequently described as \"love/hate\" by the media. Richards said in a 1998 interview: \"I think of our differences as a family squabble. If I shout and scream at him, it's because no one else has the guts to do it or else they're paid not to do it. At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done.\"\n\"Dirty Work\" (a UK and US No. 4) was released in March 1986 to mixed reviews, despite the US top-five hit \"Harlem Shuffle\". With relations between Richards and Jagger at a low, Jagger refused to tour to promote the album, and instead undertook his own solo tour, which included Rolling Stones' songs. Richards has referred to this period in his relations with Jagger as \"World War III\". As a result of the animosity within the band at this time, they almost broke up.\nJagger's solo albums, \"She's the Boss\" (UK No.\u00a06; US No.\u00a013) (1985) and \"Primitive Cool\" (UK No.\u00a026; US No.\u00a041) (1987), met with moderate success and, in 1988, with the Rolling Stones mostly inactive, Richards released his first solo album, \"Talk Is Cheap\" (UK No.\u00a037; US No.\u00a024). It was well received by fans and critics, going gold in the US. The following year \"\", a documentary spanning the career of the band, was released for their 25th anniversary.\nRichards's autobiography, \"Life\", was published on 26\u00a0October 2010. According to a 15\u00a0October 2010 article, Richards described Jagger as \"unbearable\", noting that their relationship had been strained \"for decades\". By 2015, Richards's opinion had softened. While saying Jagger could come off as a \"snob\", he added \"I still love him dearly\u00a0... your friends don't have to be perfect.\"\nActing and film production.\nJagger has had an intermittent acting career. His most significant role was in Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's \"Performance\" (1968), and as Australian bushranger Ned Kelly in the film of the same name (1970). He composed an improvised soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film \"Invocation of My Demon Brother\" on the Moog synthesiser in 1969.\nJagger auditioned for the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the 1975 film adaptation of \"The Rocky Horror Show\", a role that was eventually played by Tim Curry, the original performer from its theatrical run in London's West End. Director Alejandro Jodorowsky approached him in the same year to play the role of Feyd-Rautha in his proposed adaptation of Frank Herbert's \"Dune\", but the movie never made it to the screen. Jagger appeared as himself in the Rutles' film \"All You Need Is Cash\" (1978) and was cast as Wilbur, a main character in Werner Herzog's \"Fitzcarraldo\", in the late 1970s. The illness of principal actor Jason Robards (later replaced by Klaus Kinski), and a delay in the film's notoriously difficult production, resulted in him being unable to continue because of schedule conflicts with a Stones' tour; some footage of Jagger's work is shown in the documentaries \"Burden of Dreams\" and \"My Best Fiend\". Jagger developed a reputation for playing the heavy later in his acting career in films including \"Freejack\" (1992), \"Bent\" (1997), and \"The Man From Elysian Fields\" (2002).\nIn 1991, Jagger founded Jagged Films with Victoria Pearman and, in 1995, founded the film production company Lip Service with Steve Tisch. Jagged Films' first release was the World War\u00a0II drama \"Enigma\" (2001), starring Kate Winslet as one of Bletchley Park's Enigma codebreakers. That same year, Jagged Films produced a documentary about Jagger entitled \"Being Mick\". The programme, which first aired in the US on ABC on 22\u00a0November, coincided with the release of his fourth solo album, \"Goddess in the Doorway.\" In 2008 the company began work on \"The Women\", an adaptation of the George Cukor's film of the same name, directed by Diane English.\nAs a member of the Rolling Stones, Jagger appears in several documentaries. These include \"Gimme Shelter\", filmed during the band's 1969 tour of the US, and \"Sympathy for the Devil\" (1968) directed by French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard. Martin Scorsese worked with Jagger on \"Shine a Light\", a documentary film featuring the band with footage from the A Bigger Bang Tour during two nights of performances at New York's Beacon Theatre. It screened in Berlin in February 2008. McCarthy predicted the film would fare better once released to video than in its limited theatrical runs.\nJagger was a co-producer of, and guest-starred in, the first episode of the short-lived American comedy television series \"The Knights of Prosperity\". He also co-produced the James Brown biopic \"Get On Up\" (2014). Alongside Martin Scorsese, Rich Cohen and Terence Winter, Jagger co-created and executive produced the period drama series \"Vinyl\" (2016), which starred Bobby Cannavale and aired for one season on HBO before its cancellation. Jagger portrays an English art dealer-collector and patron in Giuseppe Capotondi's thriller \"The Burnt Orange Heresy\" (2020).\nJagger is co-producer of the upcoming film \"Miles &amp; Juliette\" about Miles Davis and Juliette Gr\u00e9co when they met in Paris in 1949.\nPersonal life.\nFamily and relationships.\nJagger has been married and divorced once, and has had other relationships, resulting in eight children with five women. As of 2024, he also has seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\nJagger's first serious girlfriend was Cleo Sylvestre, whom he began to date around 1961. Jagger dated Chrissie Shrimpton between 1963 and 1966. From 1966 to 1970, he had a relationship with Marianne Faithfull, the English singer-songwriter/actress with whom he wrote \"Sister Morphine\", a song on \"Sticky Fingers\". They broke up in May 1970 after she suffered a miscarriage and lost custody of her son. They had named the girl Corrina. Faithfull has stated that both she and Jagger were devastated at the loss, and that they both coped in different ways, her with drugs and Jagger by burying himself in work. She also stated that she knew that he longed to be a father and that the event marked the beginning of the end of their relationship.\nJagger met the American singer Marsha Hunt in 1969 and, though she was married, the pair began a relationship. When it ended in June 1970, Hunt was pregnant with Jagger's first child, Karis Hunt Jagger, who was born on 4 November 1970. Hunt is said to be the inspiration for the song \"Brown Sugar\", also from \"Sticky Fingers\".\nIn 1970, he met Nicaraguan-born Bianca P\u00e9rez-Mora Macias. They married on 12 May 1971 in a Catholic ceremony in Saint-Tropez, France. Their daughter, Jade Sheena Jezebel Jagger, was born on 21\u00a0October 1971. They separated in 1977, and in May 1978 she filed for divorce on the grounds of his adultery.\nIn late 1977, Jagger began dating American model Jerry Hall. They had an unofficial private marriage ceremony in Bali, Indonesia, on 21 November 1990, and lived at Downe House in Richmond, London. The couple had four children: Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Scarlett Jagger (born 2\u00a0March 1984), James Leroy Augustin Jagger (born in 1985), Georgia May Ayeesha Jagger (born 12\u00a0January 1992), and Gabriel Luke Beauregard Jagger (born in 1997).\nDuring his relationship with Hall, Jagger had an affair from 1991 to 1994 with Italian singer/model Carla Bruni, who later became the First Lady of France when she married then-President of France Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008. Jagger's relationship with Hall ended after she discovered that he had an affair with Brazilian model Luciana Gimenez, who gave birth to Jagger's seventh child, Lucas Maurice Morad Jagger, in May 1999. Jagger's unofficial marriage to Hall was declared invalid, unlawful, and null and void by the High Court of England and Wales in London in 1999. From 2000 to 2001 Jagger was in a relationship with the English model Sophie Dahl.\nJagger was in a relationship with fashion designer L'Wren Scott from 2001 until her death in 2014. Scott died by suicide in March 2014. She left her entire estate, estimated at US$9\u00a0million, to him. Jagger set up the L'Wren Scott scholarship at London's Central Saint Martins College.\nSince Scott died in 2014, Jagger has been in a relationship with American ballet dancer Melanie Hamrick. Jagger was 73 when Hamrick gave birth to their son Deveraux Octavian Basil Jagger in 2016.\nJagger's father, Basil \"Joe\" Jagger, died of pneumonia on 11\u00a0November 2006 at age 93. Although the Rolling Stones were on the A Bigger Bang tour, Jagger flew to Britain to see his father before returning the same day to Las Vegas, where he was to perform that night, after being informed his father's condition was improving. The show went ahead as scheduled, despite Jagger learning of his father's death that afternoon. Jagger's friends said that the show going on was \"what Joe would have wanted\". Jagger called his father the \"greatest influence\" in his life.\nInterests and philanthropy.\nJagger is a supporter of music in schools, a patron of the Mick Jagger Centre in Dartford, and sponsors music through his Red Rooster Programme in its local schools. The Red Rooster name is taken from the title of one of the Rolling Stones' earliest singles.\nAn avid cricket fan, Jagger founded Jagged Internetworks to cover the sport, beginning with the 1997-98 Singer Akai Champions Trophy. He keenly follows the England national football team, and has regularly attended FIFA World Cup games. In 2021, Fox Business quoted an estimate that his net worth was US500 million and called him \"one of music's more identifiable figures\". Earlier that same year, \"The Times\" had quoted it at approximately \u00a3310 million. In 2025, the \"Independent\" estimated his net worth at \u00a3440 million.\nHonours.\nJagger was honoured with a knighthood for services to popular music in the Queen's 2002 Birthday Honours, and on 12 December 2003 he received the accolade from The Prince of Wales. Jagger's father and daughters Karis and Elizabeth were present. Jagger stated that although the award did not have significant meaning for him, he was \"touched\" by the significance that it held for his father, saying that his father \"was very proud\". In 1989, Jagger was inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside the other Stones, including Mick Taylor and Ronnie Wood as well as Brian Jones and Ian Stewart (posthumously). In November 2004, the Rolling Stones were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame.\nIn 2014, the \"Jaggermeryx naida\" (\"Jagger's water nymph\"), a 19-million-year-old species of 'long-legged pig', was named after Jagger. Jaw fragments of the long-extinct anthracotheres were discovered in Egypt. The trilobite species \"Aegrotocatellus jaggeri\" was also named after Jagger. On Jagger's 75th birthday, scientists named seven fossil stoneflies after present and former members of the band. Two species, \"Petroperla mickjaggeri\" and \"Lapisperla keithrichardsi\", were placed within a new family Petroperlidae. The new family was named in honour of the Rolling Stones, derived from the Greek \"petra\" that stands for \"stone\". The scientists referred to the fossils as \"Rolling Stoneflies\".\nIn 2023, Jagger and bandmate Keith Richards were honoured in Dartford with statues.\nIn popular culture.\nFrom the time that the Rolling Stones developed their anti-establishment image in the mid-1960s, Jagger, with Richards, has been an enduring icon of the counterculture. This was enhanced by his drug-related arrests, sexually charged on-stage antics, provocative song lyrics, and his role in \"Performance\". One of his biographers, Christopher Andersen, describes him as \"one of the dominant cultural figures of our time\", adding that Jagger was \"the story of a generation\". Jagger, who at the time described himself as an anarchist and espoused the leftist slogans of the era, took part in a demonstration against the Vietnam War outside the US Embassy in London in 1968. This inspired him to write \"Street Fighting Man\" that same year.\nIn 1967, Cecil Beaton photographed Jagger's naked buttocks, a photo that sold at Sotheby's auction house in 1986 for $4,000.\nJagger was reported to be a contender for the anonymous subject of Carly Simon's 1972 hit song \"You're So Vain\", on which he sings backing vocals. Pop artist Andy Warhol painted a series of silkscreen portraits of Jagger in 1975, one of which was owned by Farah Diba, wife of the Shah of Iran. It hung on a wall inside the royal palace in Tehran.\nIn 2010, a retrospective exhibition of portraits of Jagger was presented at the festival Rencontres d'Arles, in France. The catalogue of the exhibition is the first photo album of Jagger and shows his evolution over 50 years.\nJagger's relationships served as the inspiration for the theatrical show parody \"Jumpin' Jack\", written by Lyle Victor Albert. In the show, the protagonist, Jack, is \"a member of that ever-expanding, worldwide club made up of Mick Jagger's illegitimate children.\"\nMaroon 5's song \"Moves like Jagger\" is about Jagger, who acknowledged the song in an interview, calling the concept \"very flattering\". Kesha's song \"Tik Tok\" and the Black Eyed Peas' hit \"The Time (Dirty Bit)\" refer to Jagger, and his vocal delivery is mentioned by rapper Ghostface Killah in his song \"The Champ\", from his 2006 album \"Fishscale\", which was later referenced by Kanye West in the 2008 T.I. and Jay-Z single \"Swagga Like Us\".\nOn television, the ITV satirical puppet show \"Spitting Image\" caricatured Jagger as perpetually high throughout its run in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1998, the MTV animated show \"Celebrity Deathmatch\" had a clay-animated fight to the death between Jagger and Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler; Jagger wins the fight by using his tongue to stab Tyler through the chest. The 2000 film \"Almost Famous\", set in 1973, refers to Jagger: \"Because if you think Mick Jagger'll still be out there, trying to be a rock star at age 50 ... you're sadly, sadly mistaken.\" This was a view that Jagger similarly shared in 1975, once quipping to \"People\" magazine \"I'd rather be dead than sing 'Satisfaction' when I'm 45\".\nIn 2012, Jagger was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork\u2014the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover\u2014to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.\nIn more recent decades, Jagger has been seen as a \"poster boy\" for healthy living and, as of 2006, was \"said to run 12 km a day, to kick-box, lift weights, cycle, and practise ballet and yoga\"; he has his own personal trainer. It has been estimated that during the average show, he covers between five and twelve miles on stage \"while strutting and shimmying through shows at dizzying speeds\".\nLegacy.\nIn the words of British dramatist and novelist Philip Norman, \"the only point concerning Mick Jagger's influence over 'young people' that doctors and psychologists agreed on was that it wasn't, under any circumstances, fundamentally harmless\". According to Norman, even Elvis Presley at his most scandalous had not exerted a \"power so wholly and disturbingly physical\". \"[W]hile [Presley] made girls scream, [he] did not have Jagger's ability to make men feel uncomfortable.\" Norman likens Jagger in his early performances with the Rolling Stones in the 1960s to a male ballet dancer, with \"his conflicting and colliding sexuality: the swan's neck and smeared harlot eyes allied to an overstuffed and straining codpiece\".\nHis performance style has been studied by academics who analysed gender, image and sexuality. Musicologist Sheila Whiteley noted that Jagger's performance style \"opened up definitions of gendered masculinity and so laid the foundations for self-invention and sexual plasticity which are now an integral part of contemporary youth culture\". His stage personas also contributed significantly to the British tradition of popular music that always featured the character song and where the art of singing becomes a matter of acting\u2014which creates a question about the singer's relationship to his own words.\nHis voice has been described as a powerful expressive tool for communicating feelings to his audience, and expressing an alternative vision of society. To express \"virility and unrestrained passion\" he developed techniques previously used by African American preachers and gospel singers such as \"the roar, the guttural belt style of singing, and the buzz, a more nasal and raspy sound\". Steven Van Zandt wrote: \"The acceptance of Jagger's voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock &amp; roll. He broke open the door for everyone else. Suddenly, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison weren't so weird\u2014even Bob Dylan.\"\nOver time, Jagger has developed into the template for rock front men and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of the \"Telegraph\", \"changed music\" through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music industry. Jagger is often described as one of the most popular and influential front men in the history of rock &amp; roll; in 1994 the \"New York Times\" noted that his \"influence hangs heavily over contemporary British rock\" as many singers \"incorporated elements\" of his onstage presence into their personas. In 2015, \"Billboard\" ranked him among the best rock front men of all time, referring to him as \"\"the\" rock and roll front man\" whose \"swagger brought a style and sexiness to rock music that he built on for decades\" and openly wondering \"would we even have rock stars without Mick?\"\nDavid Bowie joined many rock bands with blues, folk, and soul orientations in his first attempts as a musician in the mid-1960s, and he was to recall: \"I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger.\" Bowie suggested, \"I think Mick Jagger would be astounded and amazed if he realized that to many people he is not a sex symbol, but a mother image.\" Jagger appeared on \"Rolling Stone\"'s List of 100 Greatest Singers at No.\u00a016; in the article, Lenny Kravitz wrote: \"I sometimes talk to people who sing perfectly in a technical sense who don't understand Mick Jagger. [...] His sense of pitch and melody is really sophisticated. His vocals are stunning, flawless in their own kind of perfection.\" This edition also cites Jagger as a key influence on Jack White, Steven Tyler and Iggy Pop. Jagger also has been known to seek out newcomer artists to the music industry and advise them.\n\"The Telegraph\" has called Mick Jagger \"the Rolling Stone who changed music\". CNN has called Jagger's \"greatest talent, besides strutting and singing\" his \"ability to surround himself and the rest of the band with a group of very able executives.\" \"Billboard\" ranked Jagger as the greatest rock lead singer of all time, writing \"no one has moves like Jagger\u2014nor the voice, the image, the fashion sense, or the remarkably enduring charisma\u00a0... After so many years, Mick Jagger continues to personify not only the Rolling Stones but rock'n'roll itself\".\nAs Jagger has aged, his continued vitality has provoked comment. Bon Jovi front man Jon Bon Jovi said: \"I can't get over it\u00a0... I'm\u00a0... dying already and I'm gonna go out there and play four songs. How do they do it?\" Since his early career Jagger has embodied what some authors describe as a \"Dionysian archetype\" of \"eternal youth\" personified by many rock stars and the rock culture.\nJagger has repeatedly said that he will not write an autobiography, but according to John Blake, after a slew of unauthorised biographies, Jagger was persuaded by Lord Weidenfeld in the early 1980s to prepare his own for a \u00a31\u00a0million advance. The resulting 75,000-word manuscript is held by Blake, who briefly planned to publish it until Jagger withdrew support.\n\"Mick Jagger is the least egotistical person,\" observed Watts in 2008. \"He'll do what's right for the band. He's not a big head\u2014and, if he was, he went through it thirty years ago.\"\nFilmography.\nAs actor.\nJagger was slated to appear in the 1982 film \"Fitzcarraldo\" and some scenes were shot with him, but he had to leave for a Rolling Stones' tour and his character was eliminated.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57190", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57190", "title": "Muscogee", "text": "Indigenous people from Southeastern Woodlands\nThe Muscogee (English: ), Mvskoke or Mvskokvlke (, in the Muscogee language), also known as Muscogee Creek or just Creek, are a group of related Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands in the United States. Their historical homelands are in what now comprises southern Tennessee, much of Alabama, western Georgia and parts of northern Florida.\nMost of the Muscogee people were forcibly removed to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) by the federal government in the 1830s during the Trail of Tears. A small group of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy remained in Alabama, and their descendants formed the federally recognized Poarch Band of Creek Indians. Another Muscogee group moved into Florida between roughly 1767 and 1821, trying to evade European encroachment, and intermarried with local tribes to form the Seminole. Through ethnogenesis, the Seminole emerged with a separate identity from the rest of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy. The great majority of Seminole were forcibly relocated to Indian Territory in the late 1830s, where their descendants later formed federally recognized tribes. Some of the Seminole, with the Miccosukee moved south into the Everglades, resisting removal. These two tribes gained federal recognition in the 20th century and remain in Florida.\nThe respective languages of all of these modern-day branches, bands, and tribes, except one, are closely related variants called Muscogee, Mvskoke and Hitchiti-Mikasuki, all of which belong to the Eastern Muskogean branch of the Muscogean language family. These languages are mostly mutually intelligible. The Yuchi people today are part of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, but their Yuchi language is a linguistic isolate, unrelated to any other language.\nThe ancestors of the Muscogee people were part of the Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere, also known as Mississippian cultures. Between 800 and 1600 CE, they built complex cities with earthwork mounds with surrounding networks of satellite towns and farmsteads. Muscogee confederated town networks were based on a 900-year-old history of complex and well-organized farming and town layouts around plazas, ballparks, and square ceremonial dance grounds.\nThe Muscogee Creek are associated with large moundbuilding polities, such as the Ocmulgee, Etowah Indian Mounds, and Moundville sites. Precontact Muscogee polities shared agriculture, transcontinental trade, craft specialization, hunting, and religion. Early Spanish explorers encountered ancestors of the Muscogee in the mid-16th century.\nThe Muscogee were the first Native Americans officially considered by the early United States government to be \"civilized\" under George Washington's civilization plan. In the 19th century, the Muscogee were known as one of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\", because they were said to have integrated numerous cultural and technological practices of their more recent European American neighbors.\nInfluenced by Tenskwatawa's interpretations of the 1811 comet and the New Madrid earthquakes, the Upper Towns of the Muscogee, supported by the Shawnee leader Tecumseh, actively resisted European-American encroachment. Internal divisions with the Lower Towns led to the Red Stick War (Creek War, 1813\u20131814). Begun as a civil war within Muscogee factions, it enmeshed the Northern Muscogee bands as British allies in the War of 1812 against the United States, while the Southern Muscogee remained US allies. Once the northern Muscogee Creek rebellion had been put down by General Andrew Jackson with the aid of the Southern Muscogee Creek, the Muscogee nation was forced to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which ceded 22,000,000 acres of land to the US, including land belonging to the Southern Muscogee who had fought alongside Jackson. The result was a weakening of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy and the forced cession of Muscogee lands to the US.\nDuring the 1830s Indian Removal, most of the Muscogee Confederacy were forcibly relocated to Indian Territory. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation, Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town, Kialegee Tribal Town, and Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, all based in Oklahoma, are federally recognized tribes. In addition, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama, the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas are federally recognized. Formed in part originally by Muscogee refugees, the Seminole people today have three federally recognized tribes: the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, Seminole Tribe of Florida, and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida.\nHistory.\nPrecontact.\nAt least 12,000 years ago, Native Americans or Paleo-Indians lived in what is today the Southern United States. Paleo-Indians in the Southeast were hunter-gatherers who pursued a wide range of animals, including megafauna, which became extinct following the end of the Pleistocene age. During the time known as the Woodland period, from 1000 BC to 1000 AD, locals developed pottery and small-scale horticulture of the Eastern Agricultural Complex.\nThe Mississippian culture arose as the cultivation of corn (maize) from Mesoamerica led to agricultural surpluses and population growth. Increased population density gave rise to urban centers and regional chiefdoms. Stratified societies developed, with hereditary religious and political elites. This culture flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from 800 to 1500, especially along the Mississippi River and its major tributaries.\nThe early historic Muscogee were descendants of the Mississippian culture along the Tennessee River in modern Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. They may have been related to the Tama of central Georgia. Muscogee oral history describes a migration from places west of the Mississippi River, in which they eventually settled on the east bank of the Ocmulgee River. Here they waged war against other bands of Native American Indians, such as the Savanna, Ogeeche, Wapoo, Santee, Yamasee, Utina, Icofan, Patican and others, until at length they had overcome them, and absorbed some as confederates into their tribe.\nIn the mid-16th century, when explorers from the Spanish made their first forays inland from the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, many political centers of the Mississippians were already in decline, or abandoned. The region is best described as a collection of moderately sized native chiefdoms (such as the Coosa chiefdom on the Coosa River), interspersed with completely autonomous villages and tribal groups. The earliest Spanish explorers encountered villages and chiefdoms of the late Mississippian culture, beginning on April 2, 1513, with Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n's landing in Florida. The 1526 Lucas V\u00e1zquez de Ayll\u00f3n expedition in South Carolina also recorded encounters with these peoples.\nMuscogee people were gradually influenced by interactions and trade with the Europeans: trading or selling deer hides in exchange for European goods such as muskets, or alcohol. Secondly, the Spanish pressed them to identify leaders for negotiations; they did not understand government by consensus.\nSpanish expedition (1540\u20131543).\nAfter Cabeza de Vaca, a castaway who survived the ill-fated Narv\u00e1ez expedition, returned to Spain in 1537, he told the Court that Hernando de Soto had said that America was the \"richest country in the world\". Hernando de Soto was a Spanish explorer and conquistador who led the first expedition into the interior of the North American continent. De Soto, convinced of the \"riches\", wanted Cabeza de Vaca to go on the expedition, but Cabeza de Vaca declined his offer because of a payment dispute. \nFrom 1540 to 1543, de Soto explored through present-day Florida and Georgia, and then westward into the Alabama and Mississippi area. The areas were inhabited by historic Muscogee Native Americans. De Soto brought with him a well-equipped army. He attracted many recruits from a variety of backgrounds who joined his quest for riches in the Americas. \nAs the de Soto expedition's brutalities became known to the indigenous peoples, they decided to defend their territory. Chief Tuskaloosa led his people in the Battle of Mabila, where the Native Americans were defeated. The victory came at great cost to the Spanish campaign in loss of supplies, casualties, and morale. The expedition never fully recovered.\nRise of the Muscogee Confederacy.\nBecause of endemic infectious diseases carried unknowingly by the Europeans, but new to the Muscogee, the Spanish expedition resulted in epidemics of smallpox and measles, and a high rate of fatalities among the indigenous peoples. These losses were exacerbated by the Indian slave trade that colonists conducted in the Southeast during the 17th and 18th centuries. As the survivors and descendants regrouped, the Muscogee Creek Confederacy arose as a loose alliance of Muskogee-speaking peoples.\nThe Muscogee lived in autonomous villages in river valleys throughout present-day Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama, speaking several related Muskogean languages. Muskogee was spoken from the Chattahoochee to the Alabama River. Koasati (Coushatta) and Alibamu were spoken in the upper Alabama River basin and along parts of the Tennessee River. Hitchiti was spoken in several towns along the Chattahoochee River and across much of present-day Georgia. The Muscogee were a confederacy of tribes consisting of Yuchi, Koasati, Alabama, Coosa, Tuskegee, Coweta, Cusseta, Chehaw (Chiaha), Hitchiti, Tuckabatchee, Oakfuskee, and many others.\nThe basic social unit was the town (\"idalwa\"). Abihka, Coosa, Tuckabutche, and Coweta are the four \"mother towns\" of the Muscogee Confederacy. Traditionally, the Cusseta and Coweta bands are considered the earliest members of the Muscogee Nation. The Lower Towns, along the Chattahoochee River (before 1690 and after 1715), and farther east along the Ocmulgee, Oconee, and Savannah River rivers (between 1690 and 1715), were Coweta, Cusseta (Kasihta), Koloni, Tuskegee, Chiaha, Hitchiti, Oconee, Ocmulgee, Apalachicola, and Sawokli.\nThe Upper Towns, located on the Coosa, Tallapoosa and Alabama rivers, were Tuckabatchee, Abhika, Coosa (Kusa; the dominant people of East Tennessee and North Georgia during the Spanish explorations), Itawa (original inhabitants of the Etowah Indian Mounds), Hothliwahi (Ullibahali), Hilibi, Eufaula, Wakokai, Atasi, Alibamu, Coushatta (Koasati; they had absorbed the Kaski/Casqui and the Tali), and Tuskegee (\"Napochi\" in the de Luna chronicles).\nThe most important leader in Muscogee society was the \"mico\" or village chief. \"Micos\" led warriors in battle and represented their villages, but held authority only insofar as they could persuade others to agree with their decisions. \"Micos\" ruled with the assistance of \"micalgi\" or lesser chiefs, and various advisers, including a second-in-charge called the \"heniha\", respected village elders, medicine men, and a \"tustunnuggee\" or ranking warrior, the principal military adviser. The \"heles hayv\" or medicine maker officiated at various rituals, including providing black drink, used in purification ceremonies.\nThe most important social unit was the clan. Clans organized hunts, distributed lands, arranged marriages, and punished lawbreakers. The authority of the \"micos\" was complemented by the clan mothers, mostly women elders. The Muscogee had a matrilineal kinship system, with children considered born into their mother's clan, and inheritance was through the maternal line. The Wind Clan is the first of the clans. The majority of \"micos\" have belonged to this clan.\nBritish, French, and Spanish expansion.\nBritain, France, and Spain all established colonies in the present-day Southeastern woodlands. Spain established Jesuit missions and related settlements to influence Native Americans. The British and the French opted for trade over conversion. In the 17th century, Franciscan friars in Spanish Florida built missions along Apalachee Bay. In 1670, English colonists from Barbados founded Charles Town, modern-day Charleston, the capital of the new colony of Carolina. Traders from Carolina went to Muscogee settlements to exchange firearms, gunpowder, axes, glass beads, cloth and West Indian rum for white-tailed deer pelts (as part of the deerskin trade) and Indian slaves.\nThe Spanish and their \"mission Indians\" burned most of the towns along the Chattahoochee after they welcomed Scottish explorer Henry Woodward in 1685. In 1690, English colonists built a trading post on the Ocmulgee River, known as Ochese-hatchee (creek), where a dozen towns relocated to escape the Spanish and acquire English goods. The name \"Creek\" most likely derived from a shortening of Ocheese Creek (the Hitchiti name for the body of water known today as the Ocmulgee River), and broadly applies to all of the Muscogee Confederacy, including the Yuchi and Natchez.\nIn 1704, Irish colonial administrator James Moore led the Carolina militia and Ochese Creek and Yamasee warriors on a series of raids against Spanish missions in the Florida interior during Queen Anne's War. These raids captured thousands of Spanish-allied Indians, primarily Apalachee, who were sold into slavery in Carolina and the West Indies. A decade later, tensions between colonists and Indians in the region led to the Yamassee War of 1715\u201317.\nThe Ochese Creeks joined the Yamasee, burning trading posts, and raiding back-country settlers, but the revolt ran low on gunpowder and was put down by Carolinian militia and their Cherokee allies. The Yamasee took refuge in Spanish Florida, the Ochese Creeks fled west to the Chattahoochee. In 1702, French Canadian explorers founded Mobile as the first capital of Louisiana. In 1717, they took advantage of the war to build Fort Toulouse at the confluence of the Tallapoosa and Coosa, trading with the Alabama and Coushatta. Fearing they would come under French influence, the British reopened the deerskin trade with the Lower Creeks, antagonizing the Yamasee, now allies of Spain.\nThe French instigated the Upper Creeks to raid the Lower Creeks. In May 1718, the shrewd Emperor Brim, \"mico\" of the powerful Coweta band, invited representatives of Britain, France, and Spain to his village and, in council with Upper and Lower Creek leaders, declared a policy of Muscogee neutrality in their colonial rivalry. In 1718, the Spaniards built the presidio of San Marcos de Apalache on Apalachee Bay. In 1721, the British built Fort King George at the mouth of the Altamaha River. As the three European colonial powers established themselves along the borders of Muscogee lands, the Muscogee strategy of neutrality allowed them to hold the balance of power.\nIn 1732, the colony of Georgia was created. In 1733, its first settlement, Savannah, was founded on a river bluff where the Yamacraw, a Yamasee band that remained allies of Britain, allowed John Musgrove to establish a fur-trading post. His wife Mary Musgrove was the daughter of an English trader and a Muscogee woman from the powerful Wind Clan, half-sister of 'Emperor' Brim. She was the principal interpreter for Georgia's founder and first Governor Gen. James Oglethorpe, using her connections to foster peace between the Creek Indians and the new colony. In 1735, Georgia constructed Fort Okfuskee near Oakfuskee to compete with French trade with the Creeks at Fort Toulouse. The deerskin trade grew, and by the 1750s, Savannah exported up to 50,000 deerskins a year.\nIn 1736, Spanish and British officials established a neutral zone from the Altamaha to the St. Johns River in present-day Florida, guaranteeing Native hunting grounds for the deerskin trade and protecting Spanish Florida from further British encroachment. Ca. 1750 a group of Ochese moved to the neutral zone, after clashing with the Muskogee-speaking towns of the Chattahoochee, where they had fled after the Yamasee War.\nLed by Chief Secoffee (Cowkeeper), they became the center of a new tribal confederacy, the Seminole, which grew to include earlier refugees from the Yamasee War, remnants of the 'mission Indians,' and escaped African slaves. Their name comes from the Spanish word \"cimarrones\", which originally referred to a domestic animal that had reverted to the wild. \"Cimarrones\" was used by the Spanish and Portuguese to refer to fugitive slaves\u2014\"maroon\" emerges linguistically from this root as well\u2014and American Indians who fled the Europeans. In the Hitchiti language, which lacked an 'r' sound, it became \"simanoli\", and eventually Seminole.\nIntermarriage.\nMany Muscogee Creek leaders, due to intermarriage, have British names: Alexander McGillivray, Josiah Francis, William McIntosh, Peter McQueen, William Weatherford, William Perryman, and others. These reflect Muscogee women having children with British colonists. For instance, Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins married a Muscogee woman. In Muscogee culture, unmarried Muscogee women had great freedom over their own sexuality compared to European and European-American counterparts. \nUnder the customs of Muscogee matrilineal society, their children belonged to their mother's clan. With the exception of McGillivray, mixed-raced Muscogee people worked against Muscogee Creek interests, as they understood them. To the contrary, in many cases, they spearheaded resistance to settler encroachment on Muscogee Creek lands. That they usually spoke English as well as Mvskoke, and knew European customs as well, made them community leaders; they \"dominated Muskogee politics\". As put by Claudio Saunt:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs Andrew Frank writes, \"Terms such as mixed-blood and half-breed, which imply racial categories and partial Indianness, betray the ways in which Native peoples determined kinship and identity in the eighteenth- and early-nineteen-century southeast.\"\nAmerican Revolutionary War.\nWith the end of the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War) in 1763, France lost its North American empire, and British-American settlers moved inland. Indian discontent led to raids against back-country settlers, and the perception that the royal government favored the Indians and the deerskin trade led many back-country white settlers to join the Sons of Liberty. Fears of land-hungry settlers and need for European manufactured goods led the Muscogee to side with the British, but like many tribes, they were divided by factionalism, and, in general, avoided sustained fighting, preferring to protect their sovereignty through cautious participation.\nDuring the American Revolution, the Upper Creeks sided with the British, fighting alongside the Chickamauga (Lower Cherokee) warriors of Dragging Canoe, in the Cherokee\u2013American wars, against white settlers in present-day Tennessee. This alliance was orchestrated by the Coushatta chief Alexander McGillivray, son of Lachlan McGillivray, a wealthy Scottish Loyalist fur-trader and planter, whose properties were confiscated by Georgia. His ex-partner, Scots-Irish Patriot George Galphin, initially persuaded the Lower Creeks to remain neutral, but Loyalist Capt. William McIntosh led a group of pro-British Hitchiti, and most of the Lower Creeks nominally allied with Britain after the 1779 Capture of Savannah.\nMuscogee warriors fought on behalf of Britain during the Mobile and Pensacola campaigns of 1780\u201381, where Spain re-conquered British West Florida. Loyalist leader Thomas Brown raised a division of King's Rangers to contest Patriot control over the Georgia and Carolina interior and instigated Cherokee raids against the North Carolina back-country after the Battle of King's Mountain. He seized Augusta in March 1780, with the aid of an Upper Creek war-party, but reinforcements from the Lower Creeks and local white Loyalists never came. Georgia militia led by Elijah Clarke retook Augusta in 1781. In 1782, an Upper Creek war-party trying to relieve the British garrison at Savannah was routed by Continental Army troops under Gen. 'Mad' Anthony Wayne.\nAfter the war ended in 1783, the Muscogee learned that Britain had ceded their lands to the now independent United States. That year, two Lower Creek chiefs, Hopoithle Miko (Tame King) and Eneah Miko (Fat King), ceded of land to the state of Georgia. Alexander McGillivray led pan-Indian resistance to white encroachment, receiving arms from the Spanish in Florida to fight trespassers. The bilingual and bicultural McGillivray worked to create a sense of Muscogee nationalism and centralize political authority, struggling against village leaders who individually sold land to the United States. He became a wealthy landowner and merchant, owning as many as sixty black slaves.\nIn 1784, he negotiated the Treaty of Pensacola with Spain, recognizing Muscogee control over of land claimed by Georgia, and guaranteeing access to the British firm Panton, Leslie &amp; Co. which controlled the deerskin trade, while making himself an official representative of Spain. In 1786, a council in Tuckabatchee decided to wage war against white settlers on Muscogee lands. War parties attacked settlers along the Oconee River, and Georgia mobilized its militia. McGillivray refused to negotiate with the state that had confiscated his father's plantations, but President George Washington sent a special emissary, Col. Marinus Willet, who persuaded him to travel to New York City, then the capital of the U.S., and deal directly with the federal government. \nIn the summer of 1790, McGillivray and 29 other Muscogee chiefs signed the Treaty of New York, on behalf of the 'Upper, Middle and Lower Creek and Seminole composing the Creek nation of Indians,' ceding a large portion of their lands to the federal government and promising to return fugitive slaves, in return for federal recognition of Muscogee sovereignty and promises to evict white settlers. McGillivray died in 1793, and with the invention of the cotton gin, white settlers on the Southwestern frontier who hoped to become cotton planters clamored for Indian lands. In 1795, Elijah Clarke and several hundred followers defied the Treaty of New York and established the short-lived Trans-Oconee Republic.\nMuscogee and Choctaw land dispute (1790).\nIn 1790, the Muscogee and Choctaw were in conflict over land near the Noxubee River. The two nations agreed to settle the dispute by ball-play. With nearly 10,000 players and bystanders, the two nations prepared for nearly three months. After a day-long struggle, the Muscogee won the game. A fight broke out and the two nations fought until sundown with nearly 500 dead and many more wounded.\nState of Muskogee and William Bowles.\nWilliam Augustus Bowles was born into a wealthy Maryland Tory family, enlisting with the Maryland Loyalists Battalion at age 14 and becoming an ensign in the Royal Navy by age 15. Cashiered for dereliction of duty after returning too late to his ship at Pensacola, Bowles escaped north and found refuge among the Lower Creek towns of the Chattahoochee basin. He married two wives, one Cherokee and the other a daughter of the Hitchiti Muscogee chieftain William Perryman, and later used this union as the basis for his claim to exert political influence among the Creeks. \nIn 1781, a 17-year-old Bowles led Muscogee forces at the Battle of Pensacola. After seeking refuge in the Bahamas, he travelled to London. He was received by King George III as 'Chief of the Embassy for Creek and Cherokee Nations'. Tt was with British backing that he returned to train the Muscogee as pirates to attack Spanish ships.\nIn 1799, Bowles formed the State of Muskogee, with the support of the Chattahoochee Creeks and the Seminoles. He established his capital at Miccosuki, a village on the shores of Lake Miccosukee near present-day Tallahassee. It was ruled by \"Mico\" Kanache, his father-in-law and strongest ally. Bowles envisioned the State of Muskogee, with its capital at Miccosuki, encompassing large portions of present-day Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, and incorporating the Cherokee, Upper and Lower Creeks, Chickasaw and Choctaw. Bowles' first act was declaring the 1796 Second Treaty of San Ildefonso, which drew the boundary between the U.S. and West Florida, null and void, because the Indians were not consulted.\nHe denounced the treaties Alexander McGillivray had negotiated with Spain and the U.S., threatening to declare war on the United States unless it returned Muscogee lands. He issued a death sentence against George Washington's Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins, who won the loyalty of the Lower Creeks. He built a tiny navy, and raided Spanish ships in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1800, he declared war on Spain, briefly capturing the presidio and trading post of San Marcos de Apalache before being forced to retreat. \nAlthough a Spanish force that set out to destroy Mikosuki got lost in the swamps, a second attempt to take San Marcos ended in disaster. After a European armistice led to the loss of British support, Bowles was discredited. The Seminole signed a peace treaty with Spain in August 1802. The following year, he was betrayed by Lower Creek supporters of Hawkins at a tribal council. They turned Bowles over to the Spanish, and he died in prison in Havana, Cuba two years later.\nPre-removal (late 18th\u2013early 19th centuries).\nGeorge Washington, the first U.S. president, and Henry Knox, the first U.S. Secretary of War, proposed a cultural transformation of the Native Americans. Washington believed that Native Americans were equals as individuals but that their society was inferior. He formulated a policy to encourage the \"civilizing\" process, and it was continued under President Thomas Jefferson. Noted historian Robert Remini wrote, \"[T]hey presumed that once the Indians adopted the practice of private property, built homes, farmed, educated their children, and embraced Christianity, these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans.\" \nWashington's six-point plan included impartial justice toward Indians; regulated buying of Indian lands; promotion of commerce; promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Indian society; presidential authority to give presents; and punishing those who violated Indian rights. The Muscogee would be the first Native Americans to be \"civilized\" under Washington's six-point plan. Communities within the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole tribes followed Muscogee efforts to implement Washington's new policy of civilization.\nIn 1796, Washington appointed Benjamin Hawkins as Principal Temporary Agent for Indian Affairs, dealing with all tribes south of the Ohio River. He personally assumed the role of principal agent to the Muscogee. He moved to the area in Creek country that is now Crawford County in Georgia. He began to teach agricultural practices to the tribe, starting a farm at his home on the Flint River. In time, he brought in slaves and workers, cleared several hundred acres, and established mills and a trading post as well as his farm. The goal was to transform the Natives into \"respectable Americans\" in the republic, in a way that didn't involve violence.\nOne of the ways Hawkins did this was that he worked to change the gender roles that had been established in Creek society long before, to how the new American republic considered gender roles. For example, convincing the men to take up things like ranching and planting, and giving up things like hunting and being warriors, and for the women to leave behind their roles in farms and instead participate in \"household manufactures\". Hawkins also tried to convince the men to take over family property and \"assume command over their wives and daughters\".\nThere were many different factors that explained how men and women considered the plan of civilization: \"Deep-seated tensions, characterized relations between sexes in the 1700s, rather than static balance; etc.\" Men and women were separated starting from childhood, including having masculine and feminine versions of the Muscogee language where both genders had different dialects. The men and women would live separated for weeks on end; men hunting and going to war and the women caring for the children, elderly, and making clothes and preparing food. There were many instances where men and women avoided each other in ceremonies due to fear of any type of consequences, like war, childbirth, or menstruation.\nDefeat during war was seen as feminine, which was considered negative. Enemies who lost or ceded land would be degraded by being called \"old women\", and how it was seen as a disgrace and humiliating to be referred to as a woman. Later around the 1760s, there were changes to the deerskin trade that affected the relationship between women and men. European markets had an increased need for raw deerskin which meant that the labor of women who would dress the skins was no longer needed, while before that happened both men and women shared labor from the deerskin trade.\nThere was also a huge issue with drunkenness, in which the state of being drunk was associated with madness and bravery of warriors as well as distancing themselves from \"household-oriented and feminine trade in clothing\", because they traded deerskin for sugar-cane liquor. Creek men drank much more than the women did, many young Creek men when drunk thinking they were warriors. The women were against the behavior of how these warriors acted as well as against drinking rum.\nWomen's labor and manufacturing grew less needed as deerskin trade increased and the clothing was from foreign traders, their main job later being to finish the clothes with beads and gartering, but women had no say in the actual material or use of it. Even most kettles and bowls grew to be from foreign traders. There were also plantations that were started by traders, these plantations were pushing women who farmed and traded produce out of the market.\nCreek women didn't agree with the \"masculine pursuits\" that their male family members had done, including instances of hostility towards women, humiliating enemies and others by calling them \"old women\", the raping, murder, and mutilation of white women that happened because of how some Creek warriors violently expressed their masculinity, as well as the Creek women thinking of the safety of their own households. The women considered Hawkins \"plan of civilization\" around 1797 with interest compared to most of the men. The plan didn\u2019t agree with the warrior culture and promised availability of goods like food and clothing. The ranchers and planters also seemed in agreement with Hawkins, while many warriors didn\u2019t agree with his ideas nor liked his plan because they didn\u2019t want to give up hunting or their warrior culture.\nThe Plan of Civilization wanted them to take up farming, which was seen as women's work and the Creek warriors resisted that because they saw it as their masculinity being taken away. The alcohol consumption among Creek men had increased because of this shift in their gender roles as many of the warriors resisted being farmers, and the violence against women, mainly domestic, also increased.\nWhile the women agreed with many of the changes and reforms that started happening from Hawkins' plan, they refused to submit to the patriarchy, and they used the economic changes to their advantage.\nThe Creeks had started to gain property of their own, and Hawkins had said that \"they had began to know the value of property and the necessity of defending it\". From the lead of Hawkins, the Creeks had formed a national police force to force Muscogees to \"respect their neighbor's property\", also because there were some Creeks who were protective of their land and violent in the defense of the land.\nThere were different changes in the settlement, those who were going by Hawkins' plan of civilization and those who didn't go along with the plan that was happening under fenced communities in the Deep South. This was causing conflict between the Creek settlements.\nFor years, Hawkins met with chiefs on his porch to discuss matters. He was responsible for the longest period of peace between the settlers and the tribe, overseeing 19 years of peace. In 1805, the Lower Creeks ceded their lands east of the Ocmulgee to Georgia, with the exception of the sacred burial mounds of the Ocmulgee Old Fields. They allowed a Federal Road linking New Orleans to Washington, D.C. to be built through their territory. A number of Muscogee chiefs acquired slaves and created cotton plantations, grist mills and businesses along the Federal Road. In 1806, Fort Benjamin Hawkins was built on a hill overlooking the Ocmulgee Old Fields, to protect expanding settlements and serve as a reminder of U.S. rule.\nHawkins was disheartened and shocked by the outbreak of the Creek War, which destroyed his life work of improving the Muscogee quality of life. Hawkins saw much of his work toward building a peace destroyed in 1812. A faction of Muscogee joined the Pan-American Indian movement of Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh, rejecting accommodation with white settlers and adaptation of European-American culture. Although Hawkins personally was never attacked, he was forced to watch an internal civil war among the Muscogee develop into a war with the United States.\nA comet, earthquakes, and Tecumseh (1811).\nA comet appeared in March 1811. The Shawnee leader Tecumseh, whose name meant \"shooting star\", traveled to Tuckabatchee, where he told the Muscogee that the comet signaled his coming. McKenney reported that Tecumseh would prove that the Great Spirit had sent him by giving the Muscogee a sign. Shortly after Tecumseh left the Southeast, the sign arrived as promised in the form of an earthquake.\nOn December 16, 1811, the New Madrid earthquake shook the Muscogee lands and the Midwest. While the interpretation of this event varied from tribe to tribe, one consensus was universally accepted: the powerful earthquake had to have meant something. The earthquake and its aftershocks helped the Tecumseh resistance movement by convincing, not only the Muscogee, but other Native American tribes as well, that the Shawnee must be supported.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Indians were filled with great terror ... the trees and wigwams shook exceedingly; the ice which skirted the margin of the Arkansas river was broken into pieces; and most of the Indians thought that the Great Spirit, angry with the human race, was about to destroy the world.\u2014\u200a\nThe Muscogee who joined Tecumseh's confederation were known as the Red Sticks. Stories of the origin of the Red Stick name varies, but one is that they were named for the Muscogee tradition of carrying a bundle of sticks that mark the days until an event occurs. Sticks painted red symbolize war.\nRed Stick rebellion.\nThe Creek War of 1813\u20131814, also known as the \"Red Stick War\", began as a civil war within the Muscogee Nation, only to become enmeshed within the War of 1812. Inspired by the Shawnee leader Tecumseh (to whom 19th-century writers attributed fiery speeches that he \"must have said\") and their own religious leaders, and encouraged by British traders, Red Stick leaders such as William Weatherford (Red Eagle), Peter McQueen, and Menawa won the support of the Upper Creek towns. \nAllied with the British, they opposed white encroachment on Muscogee lands and the \"civilizing programs\" administered by Indian agent Benjamin Hawkins, and clashed with many of the leading chiefs of the Muscogee Nation, most notably the Lower Creek \"Mico\" William McIntosh, Hawkins' most powerful ally. Before the Muscogee Civil War began, the Red Sticks attempted to keep their activities secret from the \"old chiefs\" of the Creek national government. They were emboldened when Tecumseh rallied his followers and joined with a British invasion to capture Fort Detroit in August 1812.\nIn February 1813, a small party of Red Sticks, led by Little Warrior, was returning from Detroit when they killed two families of settlers along the Duck River, near Nashville. Hawkins demanded that the Muscogees turn over Little Warrior and his six companions. Instead of handing the marauders over to the federal agents, Big Warrior and the old chiefs decided to execute the war party. This decision was the spark which ignited the civil war among the Muscogee.\nThe first clashes between Red Sticks and the American whites took place on July 21, 1813, when a group of American soldiers from Fort Mims (north of Mobile, Alabama) stopped a party of Red Sticks who were returning from West Florida, where they had bought munitions from the Spanish governor at Pensacola. The Red Sticks fled the scene, and the U.S. soldiers looted what they found, allowing the Red Sticks to regroup and retaliate with a surprise attack that forced the Americans to retreat. The Battle of Burnt Corn, as the exchange became known, broadened the Creek Civil War to include American forces, and was interpreted as a good omen, showing that in fact the Creeks could defeat the whites.\nOn August 30, 1813, Red Sticks led by Red Eagle William Weatherford attacked Fort Mims, where white settlers and their Indian allies had gathered. The Red Sticks captured the fort by surprise, and carried out a massacre, killing men, women, and children. They spared only the black slaves whom they took as captured booty. After the Indians killed nearly 250\u2013500 at the fort, settlers across the American southwestern frontier were in a panic. Although the Red Sticks won the battle, they had lost the war.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On the morning of August 30, 1813, few of Fort Mims' defenders stirred in the steaming heat. In the forested shade, the Creeks watched and waited. The fort's main gate, located on the east side of the stockade, had not been closed by the garrison troops ... No sentries occupied the blockhouse.\nThe Fort Mims Massacre was followed two days later by the smaller Kimbell-James Massacre.\nThe only explanation of this catastrophic event is that the Upper Creek leaders thought that fighting the United States was like fighting another Creek tribe, and taking Fort Mims was an even bigger victory than the Battle of Burnt Corn had been.\nThe Red Stick victory spread panic throughout the southeastern United States, and the cry \"Remember Fort Mims!\" was popular among the public wanting revenge. With Federal troops tied up on the northern front against the British in Canada, the Tennessee, Georgia, and the Mississippi Territory militias were commissioned and invaded the Upper Creek towns. They were joined by Indian allies, the Lower Creek under William McIntosh and the Cherokee under Major Ridge. \nOutnumbered and poorly armed, much too far from Canada or the Gulf Coast to receive British aid, the Red Sticks put up a desperate fight. On March 27, 1814, General Andrew Jackson's Tennessee militia, aided by the 39th U. S. Infantry Regiment and Cherokee and Lower Creek warriors, crushed the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa River. Though the Red Sticks had been soundly defeated and about 3,000 Upper Muscogee died in the war, the remnants held out several months longer.\nMuscogee diaspora (1814).\nIn August 1814, the Red Sticks surrendered to Jackson at Wetumpka (near the present city of Montgomery, Alabama). On August 9, 1814, the Muscogee nation was forced to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson. It ended the war and required the tribe to cede some of land\u2014more than half of their ancestral territorial holdings\u2014to the United States. Even those who had fought alongside Jackson were compelled to cede land, since Jackson held them responsible for allowing the Red Sticks to revolt. The state of Alabama was created largely from the Red Sticks' domain and was admitted to the United States in 1819.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;WHEREAS an unprovoked, inhuman, and sanguinary war, waged by the hostile Creeks against the United States, hath been repelled, prosecuted and determined, successfully, on the part of the said States, in conformity with principles of national justice and honorable warfare \u2026 And whereas consideration is due to the rectitude of proceeding dictated by instructions relating to the re-establishment of peace: Be it remembered, that prior to the conquest of that part of the Creek nation hostile to the United States, numberless aggressions had been committed against the peace, the property, and the lives of citizens of the United States ...\nMany Muscogee refused to surrender and escaped to Florida. They allied with other remnant tribes, becoming the Seminole. Muscogee were later involved on both sides of the Seminole Wars in Florida.\nSeminole War.\nThe Red Stick refugees who arrived in Florida after the Creek War tripled the Seminole population, and strengthened the tribe's Muscogee characteristics. In 1814, British forces landed in West Florida and began arming the Seminoles. The British had built a strong fort on the Apalachicola River at Prospect Bluff, and in 1815, after the end of the War of 1812, offered it, with all its ordnance (muskets, cannons, powder, shot, cannonballs) to the locals: Seminoles and maroons (escaped slaves). A few hundred maroons constituted a uniformed Corps of Colonial Marines, who had had military training, however rudimentary, and discipline (but whose English officers had departed). The Seminole only wanted to return to their villages, so the maroons became owners of the Fort.\nIt soon came to be called the 'Negro Fort' by Southern planters, and it was widely known among enslaved blacks by word of mouth \u2013 a place nearby where blacks were free and had guns, as in Haiti. The white pro-slave holding planters correctly felt its simple existence inspired escape or rebellion by the oppressed African-Americans, and they complained to the US government. The maroons had not received training in how to aim the Fort's cannons. After notifying the Spanish governor, who had very limited resources, and who said he had no orders to take action, U.S. General Andrew Jackson quickly destroyed the Fort, in a famous and picturesque, though tragic, incident in 1816 that has been called \"the deadliest cannon shot in American history\" (see the Battle of Negro Fort).\nThe Seminole continued to welcome fugitive black slaves and raid American settlers, leading the U.S. to declare war in 1817. In 1818, General Andrew Jackson invaded Florida with an army that included more than 1,000 Lower Creek warriors; they destroyed Seminole towns and captured Pensacola. Jackson's victory forced Spain to sign the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty in 1819, ceding Florida to the U.S. In 1823, a delegation of Seminole chiefs met with the new U.S. governor of Florida, expressing their opposition to proposals that would reunite them with the Upper and Lower Creek, partly because the latter tribes intended to enslave the Black Seminoles. Instead, the Seminoles agreed to move onto a reservation in inland central Florida.\nTreaties of Indian Springs.\n\"Mico\" William McIntosh led the Lower Creek warriors who fought alongside the U.S. in the Creek War and the First Seminole War. The son of the Loyalist officer of the same name who had recruited a band of Hitchiti to the British cause, McIntosh never knew his white father. He had family ties to some of Georgia's planter elite, and after the wars became a wealthy cotton-planter. Through his mother, he was born into the prominent Wind Clan of the Creek; as the Creek had a matrilineal system of descent and inheritance, he achieved his chieftainship because of her. He was also related to Alexander McGillivray and William Weatherford, both mixed-race Creek.\nIn the late 1810s and early 1820s, McIntosh helped create a centralized police force called 'Law Menders,' establish written laws, and form a National Creek Council. Later in the decade, he came to view relocation as inevitable. In 1821, McIntosh and several other chiefs, including Chief Shelocta, signed away Lower Creek lands east of the Flint River at the first Treaty of Indian Springs. As a reward, McIntosh was granted at the treaty site, where he built a hotel to attract tourists to local hot springs.\nThe Creek National Council responded by prescribing the death penalty for tribesmen who surrendered additional land. Georgian settlers continued to pour into Indian lands, particularly after the discovery of gold in northern Georgia. in 1825 McIntosh and his first cousin, Georgia Governor George Troup, a leading advocate of Indian removal, signed the second Treaty of Indian Springs at his hotel. Signed by six other Lower Creek chiefs, the treaty ceded the last Lower Creek lands to Georgia, and allocated substantial sums to relocate the Muscogee to the Arkansas River. It provided for an equally large payment directly to McIntosh.\nIn April, the old Red Stick Menawa led about 200 Law Menders to execute McIntosh according to their law. They burned his upper Chattahoochee plantation. A delegation of the Creek National Council, led by the speaker \"Opothleyahola\", traveled to Washington D.C. to protest the 1825 treaty. They convinced President John Quincy Adams that the treaty was invalid, and negotiated the more favorable Treaty of Washington (1826). The tribe ceded their lands to Georgia in return for $200,000, although they were not required to move west. Troup ignored the new treaty and ordered the eviction of the Muscogee from their remaining lands in Georgia without compensation, mobilizing state militia when Adams threatened federal intervention.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The government and people of the United States will always find the Muscogees anxious to preserve peace and do justice; and all they ask in return is to be treated in like manner, and spared the afflictions in which the people of Georgia appear determined to involve them. Justice is Justice. There is not one kind for the White man and another for the Red man.\u2014\u200a\nRemoval (1834).\nIn the aftermath of the Treaty of Fort Jackson and the Treaty of Washington (1826), the Muscogee were confined to a small strip of land in present-day east central Alabama.\nAndrew Jackson was inaugurated president of the United States in 1829, and with his inauguration the government stance toward Indians turned harsher. Jackson abandoned the policy of his predecessors of treating different Indian groups as separate nations. Instead, he aggressively pursued plans to move all Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River to Oklahoma.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Friends and Brothers \u2013 By permission of the Great Spirit above, and the voice of the people, I have been made President of the United States, and now speak to you as your Father and friend, and request you to listen. Your warriors have known me long You know I love my white and red children, and always speak with a straight, and not with a forked tongue; that I have always told you the truth ... Where you now are, you and my white children are too near to each other to live in harmony and peace. Your game is destroyed, and many of your people will not work and till the earth. Beyond the great River Mississippi, where a part of your nation has gone, your Father has provided a country large enough for all of you, and he advises you to remove to it. There your white brothers will not trouble you; they will have no claim to the land, and you can live upon it you and all your children, as long as the grass grows or the water runs, in peace and plenty. It will be yours forever. For the improvements in the country where you now live, and for all the stock which you cannot take with you, your Father will pay you a fair price ...\nAt Jackson's request, the United States Congress opened a fierce debate on an Indian Removal Bill. In the end, the bill passed, but the vote was close. The Senate passed the measure 28 to 19, while in the House it squeaked by, 102 to 97. Jackson signed the legislation into law June 30, 1830.\nFollowing the Indian Removal Act, in 1832 the Creek National Council signed the Treaty of Cusseta, ceding their remaining lands east of the Mississippi to the U.S., and accepting relocation to the Indian Territory. Most Muscogee were removed to Indian Territory during the Trail of Tears in 1834, with additional removals following the Creek War of 1836, although some remained behind.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By 1836, when extensive Creek removal was underway, Eneah Emathala emerged as leader of the Lower Creeks ... their desire was only to be left alone in their homeland ... Gen. Winfield Scott was ordered to capture Eneah Emathala ... Captured with Emathala were some one thousand other person ... their [racial] colors were black, red, and white ...\u2014\u200a\nAmerican Civil War (1861).\nAt the outbreak of the American Civil War, \"Opothleyahola\" refused to form an alliance with the Confederacy, unlike many other tribes, including many of the Lower Creeks. Runaway slaves, free blacks, Chickasaw and Seminole Indians began gathering at Opothleyahola's plantation, where they hoped to remain neutral in the conflict between the North and South. On August 15, 1861, Opothleyahola and tribal chief \"Micco Hutko\" contacted President Abraham Lincoln to request help for the Union loyalists. On September 10, they received a positive response, stating the United States government would assist them. The letter directed Opothleyahola to move his people to Fort Row in Wilson County, Kansas, where they would receive asylum and aid. They became known as Loyalists, and many were members of the traditional Snake band in the latter part of the century.\nBecause many Muscogee Creek people did support the Confederacy during the Civil War, the US government required a new treaty with the nation in 1866 to define peace after the war. It required the Creek to emancipate their slaves and to admit them as full members and citizens of the Creek Nation, equal to the Creek in receiving annuities and land benefits. They were then known as Creek Freedmen. The US government required setting aside part of the Creek reservation land to be assigned to the Freedmen. Many of the tribe resisted these changes. The loss of lands contributed to problems for the nation in the late 19th century.\nThe Loyalists among the Creek tended to be traditionalists. They formed the core of a band that became known as the Snakes, which also included many Creek Freedmen. At the end of the century, they resisted the extinguishing of tribal government and break-up of communal tribal lands enacted by the US Congress with the Dawes Commission of 1892. These efforts were part of the US government's attempt to impose assimilation on the tribes, to introduce household ownership of land, and to remove legal barriers to the Indian Territory's achieving statehood. \nMembers of the Creek Nation were registered as individuals on the Dawes Rolls. The Commission separately registered intermarried whites and Creek Freedmen, whether or not they had any Creek ancestry. This ruined their claims to Creek membership later, even for people who had parents or other relative who were Creek. The Dawes Rolls have been used as the basis for many tribes to establish membership descent. European-American settlers had moved into the area and pressed for statehood and access to some of the tribal lands for settlement.\nToday.\nSome Muscogee in Alabama live near the federally recognized Poarch Creek Reservation in Atmore northeast of Mobile, Alabama, and Muscogee live in essentially undocumented ethnic towns in Florida. The Alabama reservation includes a casino and 16-story hotel. The Creek tribe holds an annual powwow on Thanksgiving. Additionally, Muscogee descendants of varying degrees of acculturation live throughout the southeastern United States. The majority of the Muscogee citizens live in Oklahoma, where the Muscogee Reservation is located. The Muscogee Nation is headquartered out of the nation's capital Okmulgee. The Muscogee Nation has over 100,000 citizens as of 2024, The Muscogee Nation has increased in popularity due to the television series Reservation Dogs, which follows the lives of four Creek teens in Oklahoma.\nCulture.\nMuscogee culture has greatly evolved over the centuries, combining mostly European-American influences; however, interaction with Spain, France, and England greatly shaped it as well. They were known for their rapid incorporation of modernity, developing a written language, transitioning to yeoman farming methods, and accepting European-Americans and African-Americans into their society. Muscogee people continue to preserve \"chaya\" and share a vibrant tribal identity through events such as annual festivals, stickball games, and language classes. The Stomp Dance and Green Corn Ceremony are revered gatherings and rituals.\nClans.\nWhile families include people who are directly related to each other, clans are composed of all people who are descendants of the same ancestral clan grouping. Like many Native American nations, the Muscogee Creek are matrilineal; each person belongs to the clan of their mother, who belongs to the clan of her mother. Inheritance and property are passed through the maternal line. Hereditary chiefs were born into certain clans.\nBiological fathers are important within the family system but must come from another clan than the mother. But, within the clan, it is the mother's brother (the mother's nearest blood relation) who functions as the primary teacher, protector, disciplinarian and role model for children, especially for boys. Clan members do not claim \"blood relation\" but consider each other as family due to their membership in the same clan. This is expressed by their using the same kinship titles for both family and clan relations. For example, clan members of approximately the same age consider each other \"brother\" and \"sister\", even if they have never met before.\nBecause of this system, the Muscogee Creek children born of European fathers belonged to their mother's clans and were part of their tribal communities. High-ranking daughters of chiefs often found it advantageous to marry European traders, who could provide their families with goods. Muscogee Creek believed young men who became educated in European ways could help them manage under the new conditions related to colonialism, while preserving important Muscogee Creek cultural institutions.\nMuscogee clans are as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClothing.\nAncestral Muscogee peoples wore clothing made of woven plant materials or animal hides, depending upon the climate. During the summer, they preferred lightweight fabrics woven from tree bark, grasses, or reeds. During the harsh winters, they used animal skins and fur for warmth.\nDuring the 17th century, the Muscogee adopted some elements of European fashion and materials. As cloth was lighter and more colorful than deer hide, it quickly became a popular trade item throughout the region. Trade cloth in a variety of patterns and textures enabled Muscogee women to develop new styles of clothing, which they made for both men, women, and children. They incorporated European trade items such as bells, silk ribbons, glass beads, and pieces of mirror into the clothing.\nLanguage.\nThe Muscogee language is a member of the Muskogean family and was well known among the frontiersmen, such as Gideon Lincecum, of the early 19th century. The language is related to the Choctaw language, with some words being identical in pronunciation. The following table is an example of Muscogee text and its translation:\nTreaties.\nLand was the most valuable asset, which the Native Americans held in collective stewardship. The southern English colonies, US government and settlers systematically obtained Muscogee land through treaties, legislation, and warfare. Some treaties, such as the Treaty of San Lorenzo, indirectly affected the Muscogee. The treaties were:\nIndian Appropriations Act of 1871.\nIn 1871, Congress added a rider to the Indian Appropriations Act to end the United States' recognizing additional Indian tribes or nations, and prohibiting additional treaties.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That hereafter no Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty: Provided, further, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to invalidate or impair the obligation of any treaty heretofore lawfully made and ratified with any such Indian nation or tribe.\nPopulation history.\nEarly estimates of the Creek probably did not cover the whole nation but just parts of the population. James Seagrove, an ambassador for the US to the Creek Nation and merchant who lived in southern Georgia, estimated the Creek population in 1794 at 10,000 warriors, and therefore around 50,000 people. In 1789, Henry Knox wrote that the Creek lived in at least 100 towns and villages. A census taken in 1832 reported 22,700 Creeks and 900 Black slaves.\nin 1836, following the Creek War, the Treaty of Fort Jackson, the Treaty of Washington (1826), the Second Creek War and the removal to Oklahoma, Indian Affairs reported 17,894 Creeks already removed to Oklahoma, while an estimated 4,000 remained east of the Mississippi. In 1841, according to Indian Affairs, the number of Creeks in Oklahoma, removed west of the Mississippi, was 24,549, while 744 still remained in the east. In 1857, Henry Schoolcraft reported the Creek population at 28,214 people. It appears that Creek population declined during the subsequent years. Enumeration published in 1886 estimated only around 14,000 Creeks in Oklahoma (Indian Territory) as of 1884. In 1910, Indian Affairs reported 11,911 in Oklahoma. The census of 1910 counted 6,945 Creeks.\nThe Creek population has rebounded in the 20th and 21st centuries. In 2020 there were 107,370 Creeks, including 50,168 in Oklahoma.\nMuscogee tribes today.\nThe Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana are a tribe of Muscogee people, descended from the Koasati, as are the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas.\nFederally recognized tribes in Oklahoma.\nThe Muscogee (Creek) Nation is a federally recognized Indian Nation. Their headquarters is in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. Their current Principal Chief is David W. Hill.\nThree Muscogee tribal towns are federally recognized tribes: Alabama-Quassarte, Kialegee, and Thlopthlocco. Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town is headquartered in Wetumka, Oklahoma and its chief is Wilson Yargee. Kialegee Tribal Town is headquartered in Wetumka. Jeremiah Hoia is the current \"mekko\" or chief. The Thlopthlocco Tribal Town is headquartered in Okemah, Oklahoma. George Scott is the mekko.\nFederally recognized tribes in Alabama.\nEddie L. Tullis led the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in their petitioning the United States government to recognize a government-to-government relationship. On August 11, 1984, these efforts culminated in the United States Government, Department of Interior, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs acknowledging that the Poarch Band of Creek Indians existed as an \"Indian Tribe\". The tribe is the only federally recognized tribe in the state of Alabama. \nOn November 21, 1984, the US government took of land into trust for the tribe as a communal holding. On April 12, 1985, were declared a reservation.\nExpansion of reservation.\nThe United States Supreme Court issued their ruling for McGirt v. Oklahoma on July 9, 2020. The Court recognized a large part of eastern Oklahoma as part of the state's Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation. The ruling also opened the possibility for Native Americans to have more power to regulate alcohol and casino gambling.\nNotable historical Muscogee people.\nMuscogee people from the 20th and 21st centuries will be listed under their respective tribes.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading"}

The concept of an Indian territory was an outcome of the U.S. federal government's 18th- and 19th-century policy of Indian removal. After the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), the policy of the U.S. government was one of assimilation.\nIndian Territory later came to refer to an unorganized territory whose general borders were initially set by the Nonintercourse Act of 1834, and was the successor to the remainder of the Missouri Territory after Missouri received statehood. The borders of Indian Territory were reduced in size as various Organic Acts were passed by Congress to create organized territories of the United States. The 1906 Oklahoma Enabling Act created the single state of Oklahoma by combining Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory, ending the existence of an unorganized independent Indian Territory as such, and formally incorporating the tribes and residents into the United States. \nBefore Oklahoma statehood, Indian Territory from 1890 onward comprised the territorial holdings of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, Seminole, and other displaced Eastern American tribes. Indian reservations remain within the boundaries of U.S. states, but are largely exempt from state jurisdiction. The term \"Indian country\" today is used to signify lands under the control of Native nations, including Indian reservations, trust lands on Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Area, or, more casually, to describe anywhere large numbers of Native Americans live.\nDescription and geography.\nIndian Territory, also known as the Indian Territories and the Indian Country, was land in the United States reserved for the forced resettlement of Native Americans. As such, it was not a traditional territory for the tribes settled upon it. The general borders were set by the Indian Intercourse Act of 1834. The territory was located in the Central United States.\nWhile Congress passed several Organic Acts that provided a path for statehood for much of the original Indian Country, Congress never passed an Organic Act for the Indian Territory. Indian Territory was never an organized territory of the United States. In general, tribes could not sell land to non-Indians (\"Johnson v. McIntosh\"). Treaties with the tribes restricted entry of non-Indians into tribal areas; Indian tribes were largely self-governing, were suzerain nations, with established tribal governments and well established cultures. The region never had a formal government until after the American Civil War.\nAfter the Civil War, the Southern Treaty Commission re-wrote treaties with tribes that sided with the Confederacy, reducing the territory of the Five Civilized Tribes and providing land to resettle Plains Indians and tribes of the Midwestern United States. These re-written treaties included provisions for a territorial legislature with proportional representation from various tribes.\nIn time, the Indian Territory was reduced to what is now Oklahoma. The Organic Act of 1890 reduced Indian Territory to the lands occupied by the Five Civilized Tribes and the Tribes of the Quapaw Indian Agency (at the borders of Kansas and Missouri). The remaining western portion of the former Indian Territory became the Oklahoma Territory.\nThe Oklahoma Organic Act applied the laws of Nebraska to the organized Oklahoma Territory, and the laws of Arkansas to the still unorganized Indian Territory, since for years the federal U.S. District Court on the eastern borderline in Ft. Smith, Arkansas had criminal and civil jurisdiction over the territory.\nHistory.\nIndian Reserve and the Louisiana Purchase.\nThe concept of an Indian territory is the successor to the British Indian Reserve, a British American territory established by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 that set aside land for use by the Native American tribes. The proclamation limited the settlement of Europeans to lands east of the Appalachian Mountains. The territory remained active until the Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolutionary War, and the land was ceded to the United States. The Indian Reserve was slowly reduced in size via treaties with the American colonists, and after the British defeat in the Revolutionary War, the Reserve was ignored by European American settlers who slowly expanded westward.\nAt the time of the American Revolutionary War, many Native American tribes had long-standing relationships with the British, and were loyal to Great Britain, but they had a less-developed relationship with the American colonists. After the defeat of the British in the war, the Americans twice invaded the Ohio Country and were twice defeated. They finally defeated the Indian Western Confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, and imposed the Treaty of Greenville, which ceded most of what is now Ohio, part of present-day Indiana, and the lands that include present-day Chicago and Detroit, to the United States federal government.\nThe period after the American Revolutionary War was one of rapid western expansion. The areas occupied by Native Americans in the United States were called Indian country. They were distinguished from \"unorganized territory\" because the areas were established by treaty.\nIn 1803, the United States agreed to purchase France's claim to French Louisiana for a total of $15 million (less than 3 cents per acre).\nPresident Thomas Jefferson doubted the legality of the purchase. Robert R. Livingston, the chief negotiator of the purchase, however, believed that the 3rd article of the treaty of the Louisiana Purchase would be acceptable to Congress. The 3rd article stated, in part:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States, and admitted as soon as possible, according to the principles of the Federal Constitution, to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United States; and in the meantime they shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and the religion which they profess.\u2014\u200a\nThis committed the U.S. government to \"the ultimate, but not to the immediate, admission\" of the territory as multiple states, and \"postponed its incorporation into the Union to the pleasure of Congress\".\nAfter the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, President Thomas Jefferson and his successors viewed much of the land west of the Mississippi River as a place to resettle the Native Americans, so that white settlers would be free to live in the lands east of the river. Indian removal became the official policy of the United States government with the passage of the 1830 Indian Removal Act, formulated by President Andrew Jackson.\nWhen Louisiana became a state in 1812, the remaining territory was renamed Missouri Territory to avoid confusion. Arkansaw Territory, which included the present State of Arkansas plus much of the state of Oklahoma, was created out of the southern part of Missouri Territory in 1819. During negotiations with the Choctaw in 1820 for the Treaty of Doak's Stand, Andrew Jackson ceded more of Arkansas Territory to the Choctaw than he realized, from what is now Oklahoma into Arkansas, east of Ft. Smith, Arkansas. The General Survey Act of 1824 allowed a survey that established the western border of Arkansas Territory 45 miles west of Ft. Smith. But this was part of the negotiated lands of Lovely's Purchase where the Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek and other tribes had been settling, and these indian nations objected strongly. In 1828 a new survey redefined the western Arkansas border just west of Ft. Smith. After these redefinitions, the \"Indian zone\" would cover the present states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and part of Iowa.\nRelocation and treaties.\nBefore the 1871 Indian Appropriations Act, much of what was called Indian Territory was a large area in the central part of the United States whose boundaries were set by treaties between the US Government and various indigenous tribes. After 1871, the Federal Government dealt with Indian Tribes through statute; the 1871 Indian Appropriations Act also stated that \"hereafter no Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty: Provided, further, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to invalidate or impair the obligation of any treaty heretofore lawfully made and ratified with any such Indian nation or tribe\".\nThe Indian Appropriations Act also made it a federal crime to commit murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, arson, burglary, or larceny within any Territory of the United States. The Supreme Court affirmed the action in 1886 in \"United States v. Kagama\", which affirmed that the U.S. government has plenary power over Native American tribes within its borders using the rationalization that \"The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful\u00a0... is necessary to their protection as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell\". While the federal government of the United States had previously recognized the Indian Tribes as semi-independent, \"it has the right and authority, instead of controlling them by treaties, to govern them by acts of Congress, they being within the geographical limit of the United States\u00a0... The Indians [Native Americans] owe no allegiance to a State within which their reservation may be established, and the State gives them no protection.\"\nReductions of area.\nWhite settlers continued to flood into Indian country. As the population increased, the homesteaders could petition Congress for creation of a territory. This would initiate an Organic Act, which established a three-part territorial government. The governor and judiciary were appointed by the President of the United States, while the legislature was elected by citizens residing in the territory. One non-voting representative was allowed a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The federal government took responsibility for territorial affairs. Later, the inhabitants of the territory could apply for admission as a full state. No such action was taken for the so-called Indian Territory, so that area was not treated as a legal territory.\nThe reduction of the land area of Indian Territory (or Indian Country, as defined in the Indian Intercourse Act of 1834), the successor of Missouri Territory began almost immediately after its creation with:\nIndian Country was reduced to the approximate boundaries of the current state of Oklahoma by the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act of 1854, which created Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory. The key boundaries of the territories were:\nKansas became a state in 1861, and Nebraska became a state in 1867. In 1890 the Oklahoma Organic Act created Oklahoma Territory out of the western part of Indian Territory, in anticipation of admitting both Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory as a future single State of Oklahoma.\nSome in federal leadership, such as Secretary of State William H. Seward, did not believe in the rights of Indians to continue their separate tribal governments, and vocally championed opening the area to white settlement while campaigning for Abraham Lincoln in 1860. \nSome historians argued Seward's words steered many tribes, notably the Cherokee and the Choctaw into an alliance with the Confederate States.\nCivil War and Reconstruction.\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, Indian Territory had been essentially reduced to the boundaries of the present-day U.S. state of Oklahoma, and the primary residents of the territory were members of the Five Civilized Tribes or Plains tribes that had been relocated to the western part of the territory on land leased from the Five Civilized Tribes. In 1861, the U.S. abandoned Fort Washita, leaving the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations defenseless against the Plains tribes. Later the same year, the Confederate States of America signed a Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws. Ultimately, the Five Civilized Tribes and other tribes that had been relocated to the area, signed treaties of friendship with the Confederacy.\nDuring the Civil War, Congress gave the U.S. president the authority to, if a tribe was \"in a state of actual hostility to the government of the United States... and, by proclamation, to declare all treaties with such tribe to be abrogated by such tribe\"(25 USC Sec. 72).\nMembers of the Five Civilized Tribes, and others who had relocated to the Oklahoma section of Indian Territory, fought primarily on the side of the Confederacy during the American Civil War in Indian territory. Brigadier General Stand Watie, a Confederate commander of the Cherokee Nation, became the last Confederate general to surrender in the American Civil War, near the community of Doaksville on June 23, 1865. The Reconstruction Treaties signed at the end of the Civil War fundamentally changed the relationship between the tribes and the U.S. government.\nThe Reconstruction era played out differently in Indian Territory and for Native Americans than for the rest of the country. In 1862, Congress passed a law that allowed the president, by proclamation, to cancel treaties with Indian Nations siding with the Confederacy (25 USC 72).\nThe United States House Committee on Territories (created in 1825) was examining the effectiveness of the policy of Indian removal, which was after the war considered to be of limited effectiveness. It was decided that a new policy of Assimilation would be implemented. To implement the new policy, the Southern Treaty Commission was created by Congress to write new treaties with the Tribes siding with the Confederacy.\nAfter the Civil War the Southern Treaty Commission re-wrote treaties with tribes that sided with the Confederacy, reducing the territory of the Five Civilized Tribes and providing land to resettle Plains Native Americans and tribes of the mid-west. General components of replacement treaties signed in 1866 include:\nOne component of assimilation would be the distribution of property held in-common by the tribe to individual members of the tribe.\nThe Medicine Lodge Treaty is the overall name given to three treaties signed in Medicine Lodge, Kansas between the U.S. government and southern Plains Indian tribes who would ultimately reside in the western part of Indian Territory (ultimately Oklahoma Territory). The first treaty was signed October 21, 1867, with the Kiowa and Comanche tribes.\nThe second, with the Plains Apache, was signed the same day. The third treaty was signed with the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho on October 28.\nAnother component of assimilation was homesteading. The Homestead Act of 1862 was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln. The Act gave an applicant freehold title to an area called a \"homestead\" \u2013 typically 160 acres (65 hectares or one-fourth section) of undeveloped federal land. Within Indian Territory, as lands were removed from communal tribal ownership, a land patent (or first-title deed) was given to tribal members. The remaining land was sold on a first-come basis, typically by land run, with settlers also receiving a land patent type deed. For these now former Indian lands, the United States General Land Office distributed the sales funds to the various tribal entities, according to previously negotiated terms.\nIt was in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government on the use of the land, that Choctaw Nation Chief Kiliahote suggested that Indian Territory be given the name \"Oklahoma,\" which derives from the Choctaw phrase , 'people', and , translated as 'red'. He envisioned an all\u2013American Indian state controlled by the tribes and overseen by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. \"Oklahoma\" later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory, and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after that area was opened to white settlers.\nOklahoma Territory, end of territories upon statehood.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Oklahoma Organic Act of 1890 created an organized Oklahoma Territory of the United States, with the intent of combining the Oklahoma and Indian territories into a single State of Oklahoma. The citizens of Indian Territory tried, in 1905, to gain admission to the union as the State of Sequoyah, but were rebuffed by Congress and an Administration which did not want two new Western states, Sequoyah and Oklahoma. Theodore Roosevelt then proposed a compromise that would join Indian Territory with Oklahoma Territory to form a single state. This resulted in passage of the Oklahoma Enabling Act, which President Roosevelt signed June 16, 1906. empowered the people residing in Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory to elect delegates to a state constitutional convention and subsequently to be admitted to the union as a single state. Citizens then joined to seek admission of a single state to the Union. \nWith Oklahoma statehood in November 1907, Indian Territory was effectively extinguished. However, in 2020, the United States Supreme Court prompted a review of tribal lands through its decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma. Subsequently, almost the entire eastern half of Oklahoma was found to have remained Indian country.\nTribes.\nTribes indigenous to Oklahoma.\nIndian Territory marks the confluence of the Southern Plains and Southeastern Woodlands cultural regions. Its western region is part of the Great Plains, subjected to extended periods of drought and high winds, and the Ozark Plateau is to the east in a humid subtropical climate zone. Tribes indigenous to the present day state of Oklahoma include both agrarian and hunter-gatherer tribes. The arrival of horses with the Spanish in the 16th century ushered in horse culture-era, when tribes could adopt a nomadic lifestyle and follow abundant bison herds.\nThe Southern Plains villagers, an archaeological culture that flourished from 800 to 1500 AD, lived in semi-sedentary villages throughout the western part of Indian Territory, where they farmed maize and hunted buffalo. They are likely ancestors of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. The ancestors of the Wichita have lived in the eastern Great Plains from the Red River north to Nebraska for at least 2,000 years. The early Wichita people were hunters and gatherers who gradually adopted agriculture. By about 900 AD, farming villages began to appear on terraces above the Washita River and South Canadian River in Oklahoma.\nMember tribes of the Caddo Confederacy lived in the eastern part of Indian Territory and are ancestors of the Caddo Nation. The Caddo people speak a Caddoan language and is a confederation of several tribes who traditionally inhabited much of what is now East Texas, North Louisiana, and portions of southern Arkansas, and Oklahoma. The tribe was once part of the Caddoan Mississippian culture and thought to be an extension of woodland period peoples who started inhabiting the area around 200 BC. In an 1835 Treaty made at the agency-house in the Caddo Nation and state of Louisiana, the Caddo Nation sold their tribal lands to the U.S. In 1846, the Caddo, along with several other tribes, signed a treaty that made the Caddo a protectorate of the U.S. and established framework of a legal system between the Caddo and the U.S. Tribal headquarters are in Binger, Oklahoma.\nThe Wichita and Caddo both spoke Caddoan languages, as did the Kichai people, who were also indigenous to what is now Oklahoma and ultimately became part of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. The Wichita (and other tribes) signed a treaty of friendship with the U.S. in 1835. The tribe's headquarters are in Anadarko, Oklahoma.\nIn the 18th century, prior to Indian Removal by the U.S. federal government, the Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche people entered into Indian Territory from the west, and the Quapaw and Osage entered from the east. During Indian Removal of the 19th century, additional tribes received their land either by treaty via land grant from the federal government of the United States or they purchased the land receiving fee simple recorded title.\nTribes from the Southeastern Woodlands.\n \nMany of the tribes forcibly relocated to Indian Territory were from Southeastern United States, including the so-called Five Civilized Tribes or Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee Creeks, and Seminole, but also the Natchez, Yuchi, Alabama, Koasati, and Caddo people.\nBetween 1814 and 1840, the Five Civilized Tribes had gradually ceded most of their lands in the Southeast section of the US through a series of treaties. The southern part of Indian Country (what eventually became the State of Oklahoma) served as the destination for the policy of Indian removal, a policy pursued intermittently by American presidents early in the 19th century, but aggressively pursued by President Andrew Jackson after the passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. The Five Civilized Tribes in the South were the most prominent tribes displaced by the policy, a relocation that came to be known as the Trail of Tears during the Choctaw removals starting in 1831. The trail ended in what is now Arkansas and Oklahoma, where there were already many Indians living in the territory, as well as whites and escaped slaves. Other tribes, such as the Delaware, Cheyenne, and Apache were also forced to relocate to the Indian territory.\nThe Five Civilized Tribes established tribal capitals in the following towns:\nThese tribes founded towns such as Tulsa, Ardmore, Muskogee, which became some of the larger towns in the state. They also brought their African slaves to Oklahoma, which added to the African American population in the state.\nTribes from the Great Lakes and Northeastern Woodlands.\nThe Western Lakes Confederacy was a loose confederacy of tribes around the Great Lakes region, organized following the American Revolutionary War to resist the expansion of the United States into the Northwest Territory. Members of the confederacy were ultimately removed to the present-day Oklahoma, including the Shawnee, Delaware, also called Lenape, Miami, and Kickapoo.\nThe area of Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma was used to resettle the Iowa, Sac and Fox, Absentee Shawnee, Potawatomi, and Kickapoo tribes.\nThe Council of Three Fires is an alliance of the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi tribes. In the Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien in 1829, the tribes of the Council of Three Fires ceded to the United States their lands in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The 1833 Treaty of Chicago forced the members of the Council of Three Fires to move first to present-day Iowa, then Kansas and Nebraska and ultimately to Oklahoma.\nThe Illinois Potawatomi moved to present-day Nebraska and the Indiana Potawatomi moved to present-day Osawatomie, Kansas, an event known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death. The group settling in Nebraska adapted to the Plains Indian culture but the group settling in Kansas remained steadfast to their woodlands culture. In 1867, part of the Kansas group negotiated the \"Treaty of Washington with the Potawatomi\" in which the Kansas Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation split and part of their land in Kansas was sold, purchasing land near present-day Shawnee, Oklahoma, they became the Citizen Potawatomi Nation.\nThe Odawa tribe first purchased lands near Ottawa, Kansas, residing there until 1867 when they sold their lands in Kansas and purchased land in an area administered by the Quapaw Indian Agency in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, becoming the Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma.\nThe Peoria tribe, native to Southern Illinois, moved south to Missouri then and Kansas, where they joined the Piankashaw, Kaskaskia, and Wea tribes. Under stipulations of the Omnibus Treaty of 1867, these confederated tribes and the Miami tribe left Kansas for Indian Territory on lands purchased from the Quapaw.\nIroquois Confederacy.\nThe Iroquois Confederacy was an alliance of tribes, originally from the Upstate New York area consisting of the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and, later, Tuscarora. In the pre-Revolutionary War era, their confederacy expanded to areas from Kentucky and Virginia north. All of the members of the Confederacy, except the Oneida and Tuscarora, allied with the British during the Revolutionary War, and were forced to cede their land after the war. Most moved to Canada after the Treaty of Canandaigua in 1794, though some remained in New York state and some moved to Ohio, where they joined the Shawnee.\nThe 1838 and 1842 Treaties of Buffalo Creek were treaties with New York Indians, such as the Seneca, Mohawk, Cayuga, and Oneida Indian Nation, which covered land sales of tribal reservations under the U.S. Indian removal program, under which they planned to move most eastern tribes to Indian Territory. Initially, the tribes were moved to the present state of , and later to Oklahoma on land administered by the Quapaw Indian Agency.\nPlains Indian tribes.\nWestern Indian Territory is part of the Southern Plains and is the ancestral home of the Wichita people, a Plains tribe. Additional indigenous peoples of the Plains entered Indian Territory during the horse culture era. Prior to adoption of the horse, some Plains Indian tribes were agrarian and others were hunter-gatherers. Some tribes used the dog as a draft animal to pull small travois (or sleighs) to help move from place to place; however, by the 18th century, many Southern Plains tribes adopted the horse culture and became nomadic. The tipi, an animal hide lodge, was used by Plains Indians as a dwelling because they were portable and could be reconstructed quickly when the tribe settled in a new area for hunting or ceremonies.\nThe Arapaho historically had assisted the Cheyenne and Lakota people in driving the Kiowa and Comanche south from the Northern Plains, their hunting area ranged from Montana to Texas. Kiowa and Comanche controlled a vast expanse of territory from the Arkansas River to the Brazos River. By 1840 many plains tribes had made peace with each other and developed Plains Indian Sign Language as a means of communicate with their allies.\nPlateau tribes.\nAfter the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873, Modoc people were forced from their homelands in southern Oregon and northern California to settle at the Quapaw Agency, Indian Territory. The federal government permitted some to return to Oregon in 1909. Those that remained in Oklahoma became the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma.\nThe Nez Perce, a Plateau tribe from Washington and Idaho, were sent to Indian Territory as prisoners of war in 1878, but after great losses in their numbers due to disease, drought and famine, they returned to their northwestern homelands in 1885.\nGovernment.\nDuring the Reconstruction Era, when the size of Indian Territory was reduced, the renegotiated treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes and the tribes occupying the land of the Quapaw Indian Agency contained provisions for a government structure in Indian Territory. Replacement treaties signed in 1866 contained provisions for:\nIn a continuation of the new policy, the 1890 Oklahoma Organic Act extended civil and criminal laws of Arkansas over the Indian Territory, and extended the laws of Nebraska over Oklahoma Territory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is subdivided into 100 ngwee. On 31 March 2025, the Bank of Zambia launched the new \"Heritage Series\"\u2014a refreshed currency family of six banknotes (K10, K20, 50, 100, K200, K500) and six coins (5 ngwee, 10 ngwee, 50 ngwee, K1, K2, K5)\u2014featuring enhanced security and national heritage themes.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"kwacha\" derives from the Nyanja, Bemba, and Tonga language word for \"dawn\", alluding to the Zambian nationalist slogan of a \"new dawn of freedom\". The name \"ngwee\" translates as \"bright\" in the Nyanja language.\nHistory.\nPrior to independence in 1964, the Rhodesia and Nyasaland pound was the legal tender of the British protectorate of Northern Rhodesia. Banknotes of 10 shillings, 1, 5, and 10 pounds issued by the Central Africa Currency Board were in circulation, together with coins of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442, 1, 3, 6 pence, and 1, 2, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442, and 5 shillings. After independence, the Bank of Zambia issued the first Zambian currency, the Zambian pound, in 1964. The issued paper bills and coins were of similar denominations as these used before independence, except for the 10 pounds note, which was never issued by the Bank of Zambia. A new design to depict the newly independent country's history and struggle was adopted. The two currencies \u2013 the Rhodesia and Nyasaland pound and the Zambian pound, were allowed to circulate in parallel until December 15, 1965, when the South Rhodesian pound bills and coins were withdrawn from circulation, except for the 3 pence coin which was allowed to circulate alongside its Zambian alternative for a brief period.\nOn July 1, 1966, the parliament approved the arrangements of the decimal currency system (Act 40 of 1966), changing the main currency unit to Kwacha, with one kwacha being equal to 100 ngwee. The exchange rate was set to one kwacha equivalent to ten Zambian shillings, or one half of a Zambian pound. Thus, by January 16, 1968, all Zambian pound notes and coins were removed from circulation and replaced by the new kwacha notes, and ngwee coins. The Zambian pound notes of 10 shillings, 1, and 5 pounds were changed into 1, 2 and 10 kwacha respectively, a note of 50 ngwee was issued to replace the old 5 shillings coin, alongside a new note of 20 kwacha. Ngwee coins with the denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 ngwee replacing the existing 1, 3, 6 pence, 1, and 2 shillings coins respectively. The Zambian pound notes, and coins ceased to be a legal tender on January 31, 1974.\nAt the very beginning, the kwacha was pegged to the pound sterling at a fixed rate of 1.7094 kwacha per 1 pound. Yet, after the devaluation of the US dollar on August 15, 1971, Zambia broke all its currency's ties to the British monetary unit, and pegged the kwacha to the American monetary unit. These reforms resulted in a reduction of the kwacha's gold standard by 7.8%. A few months later, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber, announced the demise of the Sterling area, and flotation of the sterling pound, causing Zambia to renounce the monetary privileges once enjoyed as a member state.\nThroughout the years, the Zambian currency suffered high inflation, forcing the Bank of Zambia to introduce high value denominations in 2003, including 20,000 bills to facilitate transactions. In 2013, a new, redenominated kwacha was introduced. The value of Zambian currency dropped following redenomination; the exchange rate was 22 kwacha to one U.S. dollar in April 2021. After the 2021 Zambian general election saw a defeat for Edgar Lungu, the currency's depreciation was reversed; as of 2021[ [update]] one U.S. dollar was exchanged for about 16 kwacha. Since the inauguration of president Hakainde Hichilema in 2021, the kwacha has enjoyed a steady exchange rate hovering around 17 to 19 per one U.S. dollar well into the year 2023, however following the drought, reduced economic activity and up to 15 hours of load-shedding to name a few current issues the economy has stagnated and the kwacha has since depreciated to an all time high of one U.S. dollar per 27 Zambian kwacha. By October 2025, the Kwacha had recovered to 22.60 per US Dollar. \nCoins.\nIn 1968, bronze 1 and 2 ngwee and cupro-nickel 5, 10 and 20 ngwee were introduced. These coins all depicted president Kenneth Kaunda on the obverse and flora and fauna on the reverse. A twelve sided 50 ngwee coin was introduced in 1979 to replace the 50 ngwee note and featured commemorative FAO themes.\nIn 1982, copper-clad-steel replaced bronze in the 1 and 2 ngwee. These two were struck until 1983, with production of the 5 and 10 ngwee ceasing in 1987 and that of the 20 ngwee in 1988. Nickel-brass 1 kwacha coins were introduced in 1989 and depicted \"Bank of Zambia\" on the edges. The period of circulation for this coin was brief as inflation rates skyrocketed.\nIn 1992, a new, smaller coinage was introduced consisting of nickel-plated-steel 25 and 50 ngwee and brass 1, 5 and 10 kwacha. The coins depict the national crest on the obverse and native fauna on the reverse. The coins were issued only one year and then discontinued as the economic crisis dragged on.\nAll these coins, both from the older and newer series still remain legal tender. However, the value of the metal in the coins is worth more than their irrelevant face value, so they are never seen or used in normal trade. The only place coins might be seen today is when they are sold as souvenirs to tourists.\nOn January 1, 2013, new coins were introduced, namely for 5, 10, 50 ngwee and 1 kwacha.\nCoins of the new kwacha (2013 series)\nBanknotes.\nThe Zambian kwacha was first issued in 1968 to replace the Zambian pound. The design of the kwacha bill changed as time went on, also, different bills were either introduced in or withdrawn from circulation. Seven emissions of the first kwacha are known to exist, while only one emission of the second kwacha was introduced in circulation on January 1, 2013, and still existing since then without any changes in design or security features. Each emission share similar general features in design throughout all the banknotes, with slight changes concerning the colors and the activity based theme on the reverse of the banknotes.\nFirst kwacha (1968\u20132012).\nFirst issue (1968).\nThe first issue of the first kwacha was issued in 1968. The series comprised five banknotes of 50 ngwee, 1, 2, 10, and 20 kwacha. The obverse of the five banknotes featured a portrait of president Kenneth Kaunda in tribal outfit on the right, together with the Coat of Arms of Zambia on the left on the 50 ngwee banknote, or at upper center on the kwacha banknotes. The reverse showed different activity based themes reflecting life in Zambia. The banknotes were printed by Thomas De La Rue &amp; Co. Limited, and bore the signature of Dr Justin B. Zulu, Bank of Zambia's second governor. Apart from the 50 ngwee banknote, the kwacha banknotes had president Kenneth Kaunda as a watermark. Specimen banknotes were issued for each denomination, with the word SPECIMEN overprint in red sans on both the obverse and reverse.\nSecond emission (1969\u20131973).\nIn 1969, a second emission of the Zambian kwacha was issued. Initially, the emission comprised the same five banknotes of the first emission, and all five denominations bore the signatures of Dr Justin B. Zulu, Mr Valentine S. Musakanya, and that of Mr Bitwell R. Kuwani, the second, third, and forth governors of the Bank of Zambia, respectively, except for the 50 ngwee bills that never existed with Dr Zulu's signature, as well as the 1 kwacha bills that never showed Mr Kuwani's signature. The second emission banknotes were exactly similar to these of the first emission, except for a slight difference, in which the dot (\u2022) between the currency symbol and the face value was removed. The banknotes were printed by Thomas De La Rue &amp; Co. Limited, and specimen banknotes were issued for each denomination, with the word SPECIMEN overprint in red sans on both the obverse and reverse.\nDuring the second emission period, a commemorative banknote of 1 kwacha was issued in celebration of the declaration of One-party state on December 13, 1972. The banknote was not a legal tender, and had a different frame design than the banknotes of both, the first and second issues.\nLater on in 1973, the Bank of Zambia issued the 5 kwacha banknote for the first time. A red-violet on multicolour underprint design was chosen for the new bill note. The new design resulted in a lot of confusion between the existing 50 ngwee bill and the new 5 kwacha one. This urged the Bank of Zambia to adopt a new design for the 50 ngwee banknotes in 1973. A new black and lilac on multicolor underprint was used for easy recognition, nevertheless, this was the last issue of the 50 ngwee banknotes as it was replaced later by a coin. The two new banknotes bore the signature of Mr Bitwell R. Kuwani, and were printed by Thomas De La Rue &amp; Co. Limited. Specimen banknotes were issued for both denominations, with the word SPECIMEN overprint in red sans on both the obverse and reverse.\nThird issue (1974\u20131976).\nPrior to the third issue, short-lived designs of the obverses of the 10 and 20 kwacha banknotes were introduced. The new banknotes were printed by the English engraving, and printing company Bradbury, Wilkinson &amp; Co. The new designs featured an older portrait of president Kenneth Kaunda, without the usual frame design, and bearing the signature of Mr Bitwell R. Kuwani. Specimen banknotes were issued for both banknotes, with the word SPECIMEN overprint in red sans on both the obverse and reverse. Thanks to their scarcity, both bills are the most expensive banknotes of the Zambian collection among notaphilists.\nIn 1976, a four bills third issue was issued, in which the old frame design was re-adopted once again. Banknotes with all denominations were reproduced, except for the twenty kwacha bill, which was never issued in spite of being redesigned. All bills bore the signatures of Mr Luke J. Mwananshiku, the fifth governors of the Bank of Zambia, except for the two kwacha banknotes, which retained the signature of Mr Bitwell R. Kuwani. The third emission banknotes were exactly similar to these of the second emission, except for president Kenneth Kaunda's portrait, where an older portrait replaced the younger portrait appearing on the first, and second emissions. The banknotes were once again printed by Thomas De La Rue &amp; Co. Limited, and specimen banknotes were issued for each denomination, with the word SPECIMEN overprint in red sans on both the obverse and reverse.\nUntil 1991, all Zambian banknotes featured a portrait of President Kenneth Kaunda on the obverse. After 1992, all notes have instead featured a fish eagle on the obverse. After 1989, all the reverses featured the Chainbreaker statue. In 2003, Zambia became the first African country to issue polymer banknotes. The 500 and 1000 kwacha were both printed on polymer. Although the old 20 kwacha note was still in circulation until 2012, such is the rarity of this note that most major retailers rounded prices up to the nearest 50 kwacha when calculating a total. Most items in major supermarkets were displayed using 20 kwacha in the value (e.g., 1980 kwacha).\nNew Kwacha (2012 series).\nOn January 23, 2012, the Bank of Zambia proposed certain measures in regards of the redenomination of the Zambian kwacha. Such recommendations were initially approved by the government, being one of the measures required to address costs associated with the continuous devaluation of the national currency, due to depreciation throughout time, as a direct result of several years of high inflation rates that characterized the national economy during the late decades of the 20th century, and the early years of the 21st century. The recommendations were assented to the parliament on November 3, 2012. Later, The Re-Domination of Currency Act (Act 8 of 2012) was enacted on December 3, 2012.\nThe old currency unit was divided by 1000, hence, removing three zeros from the preexisting K50,000, K20,000, K10,000, K5,000, and K1,000. The lower denominations of K500, K100, and K50 were also divided by 1000 and were changed into the 50, 10, and 5 Ngwee coins respectively. On the other hand, the preexisting K20 banknote was removed from circulation due to its extremely low purchasing power.\nThe Bank of Zambia announced January 1, 2013, as the changeover date. On the same day, the new redenominated currency became the legal tender of Zambia. The old and new currencies were allowed to circulate side by side for a transition period of six months, until June 30, 2013. During this period, the old currency was denoted by 'K', whilst the new one was denoted by 'KR'. After the six-month period, the 'KR' symbol was dropped, and the new currency was referred to by the 'K' symbol.\nBy June 26, 2013, the Bank of Zambia managed to withdraw 3.7\u00a0trillion Kwacha in old banknotes, accumulating to about 95.3% of the circulating banknotes. Although the old currency ceased to be legal tender four days later, the Bank of Zambia Deputy Governor, announced that residents who were still holding to the old currency, especially those living in rural areas, could still be able to exchange the old currency for the new one through commercial banks, and other designated agents.\nDesign.\nWhile being the first African country to introduce polymer banknotes in 2003, the new currency banknotes are all printed on paper, with advanced security features. The six newly issued banknotes share multiple common features on both the obverse and reverse, together with few different features, that are unique for each banknote. All banknotes have the same height of 70\u00a0mm, the 2 Kwacha, and 5 Kwacha banknotes are 140\u00a0mm wide, whilst the rest of the banknotes are 145\u00a0mm wide. All new banknotes were printed by the German printing company G&amp;D, except for the 2015 issue of the 100 Kwacha banknote, which was printed by the Dutch Royal Joh. Ensched\u00e9.\nThe obverse of the new currency features four common features, found on the obverse of all the six banknotes, and a single unique feature for each one of them. The common features are: the African fish eagle which considered, by far, the primary recognition feature on all the Zambian banknotes, together with the coat of arms, the signature of the Bank of Zambia Governor and obligation to pay the sum indicated on the banknote, and the face value of the specified banknote. Each banknote features a unique indigenous tree from the abundant forests covering the country.\nThe reverse features the Freedom Statue in Lusaka, the issuing authority of legal tenders in Zambia, Bank of Zambia, in the middle at the top, the face value of the banknote in words in the lower left corner, and in numerals in the other three corners. There is also a unique depiction of wildlife in Zambia, together with an activity based theme on each reverse of the six banknotes.\nSecurity features.\nMultiple security features were applied to avoid counterfeit banknotes. Anti-counterfeiting measures used included holograms, multi-colored bills, embedded devices such as strips, microprinting, watermarks and different types of optically variable inks, and the use of design features which prevent counterfeiting by photocopying or scanning.\nCommemorative banknotes.\nSince its inauguration in 1964 and until the second half of 2016, the Bank of Zambia had issued two commemorative banknotes. The first commemorative banknote was a One Kwacha banknote issued in 1973, commemorating the birth of the second republic, an incident in which the regime, led by president Kenneth Kaunda, decided on December 13, 1972, to set up a One-party state as from January 1, 1973. Apart from the issued note, a specimen banknote was also issued in celebration of the same occasion.\nOn October 23, 2014, one day before the celebrations of the independence day, the Bank of Zambia revealed its second ever commemorative banknote. A Fifty Kwacha banknote was issued commemorating the 50th Independence Anniversary. Unlike the previous commemorative banknotes and coins of Zambia, the new commemorative banknote was the first commemorative banknote allowed in circulation as a legal tender in the country, bearing the same features of the existing Fifty Kwacha bills.\nExchange Rates.\nAs of 29 July 2024:\nAs of 14 October 2025:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is divided into 100 tambala. The kwacha replaced other types of currency, namely the British pound sterling, the South African rand, and the Rhodesian dollar, that had previously circulated through the Malawian economy. The exchange rate of the kwacha undergoes fixed periodical adjustments, but since 1994 the exchange rate has floated. In 2005, administrative measures were put in place by Bingu wa Mutharika to peg the exchange rate with other currencies. Banknotes are issued by the Reserve Bank of Malawi. In May 2012, the Reserve Bank of Malawi devalued the kwacha by 34% and unpegged it from the United States dollar.\nThe currency was further devalued by 25% by the central bank in May 2022 followed by another 44% devaluation in November 2023 raising inflation rate in Malawi.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"kwacha\" was first used in Zambia, where the Zambian kwacha was introduced in 1968. It derives from the Chinyanja or Chichewa word meaning \"it has dawned\", while \"tambala\" translates as \"rooster\" in Chichewa. The tambala was so named because a hundred roosters announce the dawn.\nHistory.\nThe kwacha replaced the Malawian pound on 15 February 1971 (on the same day the United Kingdom decimalised) at a rate of two kwacha to one pound. Malawi followed the pattern of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand in that when it adopted the decimal system, it decided to use the half pound unit as opposed to the pound unit of account.\nAs of 2019,[ [update]] one British pound sterling was equal to approximately 883.43 kwachas, one US dollar was equal to 725.16 kwachas and one South African rand was equal to 47.69 kwachas. As of 2019[ [update]] one Euro\u00a0is equivalent to 797.42 Kwachas.\nAs of 2025,[ [update]] one British pound sterling was equal to approximately 2349 kwachas, one US dollar was equal to 1734 kwachas, one South African rand was equal to 104 kwachas and one Euro\u00a0was equivalent to 2063 Kwachas. However, in the street, US dollars can bring a black market rate of 4300 kwachas.\nCoins.\nThe first coins introduced in 1971 were in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 tambala. In 1986, 50 tambala and 1 kwacha coins were also introduced. In January 2007, 5 and 10 kwacha coins, which actually bear a mint date of 2006, were also released into circulation. On 23 May 2012 new 1, 5 and 10 kwacha coins were released into circulation\nThe 1 and 2 tambala coins are composed of copper-plated steel. The 5 tambala coin is of nickel-plated steel. The 50 tambala and 1 kwacha coin are composed of brass-plated steel. \nDue to inflation, coins have become redundant because of their minimal value.\nBanknotes.\nIn 1971, banknotes dated 1964 were introduced in denominations of 50 tambala, 1, 2 and 10 kwacha. 5 kwacha notes were introduced in 1973 when the 2 kwacha note was discontinued. 20 kwacha notes were introduced in 1983. 50 tambala notes were last issued in 1986, with the last 1 kwacha notes printed in 1992. In 1993, 50 kwacha notes were introduced, followed by 100 kwacha in 1993, 200 kwacha in 1995, 500 kwacha in 2001 and 2000 kwacha in November 2016 to ease desperate cash shortages.\nAs of 2008, the following banknote denominations are in circulation:\nAccording to an article in the \"Nyasa Times\" dated 9 March 2012, within the next six months the Reserve Bank of Malawi would introduce a whole new series of notes, including a 1,000-kwacha note, twice the largest denomination currently in circulation. The notes were announced in Biantyre on 8 March by Governor Dr. Perks Ligoya. The new notes would be much smaller in size than the current notes, which served as a cost-cutting measure. The new 1,000-kwacha note was going to be printed by De La Rue.\nOn 23 May 2012, the \"Nyasa Times\" reported that the Reserve Bank of Malawi introduced the new 1,000 kwacha note into circulation along with the proposed new notes. The new 1,000 kwacha note was valued at around US$4. The new kwacha had the face of the first president Kamuzu Banda on the front and the back carries a depiction of Mzuzu maize silos.\nThe new 20 kwacha note was found to contain an error. On the back of the note is a building identified as the Domasi Teacher's Training College (now known as the Domasi College of Education). However, it is reported that the building is, in fact, the Machinga Teacher's Training College.\nThe Reserve Bank of Malawi is going to revise its new family of notes so that they are more \"blind friendly\". According to the Malawi Union of the Blind, the current notes have raised dots to aid in recognition of the denominations, but the dots are too small to be useful.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 103,725. The county seat is Elkton. The county is part of the Mid-Eastern Shore region of the state.\nThe county was named for Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605\u20131675), the first Proprietary Governor of the Province (colony) of Maryland. With the eastern part of the county closer to Philadelphia than Baltimore, it is part of the Philadelphia\u2013Camden\u2013Wilmington, PA\u2013NJ\u2013DE\u2013MD Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is located in Wilmington's Radio Market and Baltimore's Designated Market Area.\nHistory.\nColonial era.\nThe area now known as Cecil County was an important trading center long before the county's official organization in 1674 by proclamation of Lord Baltimore. It had previously been a northeastern part of a much larger Baltimore County, Maryland, in the northeastern portion of the Province. This had included present-day Baltimore and Baltimore County, and Harford, Carroll, eastern Frederick, and portions of Howard and Anne Arundel counties. At the time of its founding, Cecil County also included modern Kent County and the border on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay went as far south as the Chester River, until its later formation in 1706. The Piscataway traded with the Susquehannocks near Conowingo, and with Lenape of the Delaware valley and their Nanticoke allies near the Elk River and Elk Neck Peninsula. A southern tribe sometimes called the Shawnace also moved into what later became North East, Maryland. Captain John Smith visited the area in 1608. William Claiborne, a Puritan trader based in Virginia, earlier established a trading post at what is now known as Garrett Island at the mouth of the Susquehanna River near what became Perryville. Bohemian immigrant Augustine Herman lobbied for Cecil County's creation, and drew the 1674 maps, in exchange for which Herman received extensive land grants, including one developed as Bohemia Manor, where he eventually died. Another early developer was George Talbot, appointed Surveyor-General of Maryland in 1683, who came from Ballyconnell, County Cavan, Ireland. Talbot's original grant of land in Susquehanna, Cecil County is viewable online. Its subsequent history is told in the Crofton Papers, page 153.\nUntil the American Revolution, Cecil County was an important shipping center, both within the colonies and abroad. It exported not only its own agricultural products but also animal skins from the west and tobacco from the south. St. Francis Xavier Church (Warwick, Maryland) begun as a Jesuit mission in 1704 and rebuilt in 1792, is one of Maryland's oldest churches, though now a museum. St. Mary Anne's Episcopal Church, authorized in 1706 and rebuilt in 1742 is another (and still in use, as well as maintaining a historic graveyard). West Nottingham Academy, founded by Presbyterian Rev. Samuel Finley in 1744, educated Benjamin Rush and Richard Stockton, both of whom signed the Declaration of Independence, and still operates today (though disaffiliated from the Presbyterian church and with additional buildings). The Principio Furnace, founded in 1719, became an important exporter of pig iron. During the American Revolution both British and colonial troops traveled through Cecil County, although no major battles occurred within its borders. The Battle of Cooch's Bridge occurred in nearby Delaware, and both General Howe and General George Washington stopped in Elkton during the summer of 1777. Robert Alexander, the area's delegate to the Continental Congress of 1776, spoke with both sides but ultimately decided to go into exile in England without his wife. She remained a loyal Marylander and received a life estate in some of Elkton property that Maryland confiscated.\n19th century.\nThe War of 1812 caused Cecil County considerable damage. Not only did British Admiral George Cockburn blockade the upper Chesapeake Bay, in response to musket fire from colonials at Welch Point, his troops destroyed a trading post known as Frenchtown. They tried to sail further up the Elk River to the county seat at Elkton, but turned back under fire from Fort Defiance, also hindered by a cable across the navigation channel. British troops also destroyed most of Havre de Grace in nearby Harford County, Maryland. Cockburn's ships then traveled up the Sassafras River, and, meeting resistance, destroyed Georgetown, Maryland and Fredericktown, Maryland. Avoiding Port Deposit which rumors called heavily defended, the British destroyed the Principio Iron Works, an important military target.\nPort Deposit boomed after the Susquehanna Canal opened in 1812. Engineer James Rumsey, who grew up in Bohemia Manor before moving to Bath, Virginia (or Berkeley Springs, West Virginia), invented a steamboat which he demonstrated to George Washington, before traveling to London to secure patents against competition from John Finch. Rumsey died there in 1792, but his lawyer brother Benjamin Rumsey moved south to Joppa, Maryland and served as Maryland's Chief Justice for 25 years. Steamboats, using technology such as by Robert Fulton, came to dominate travel on the bay during the following decades. The Eagle, built in Philadelphia in 1813, transported travelers between Baltimore and Elkton, where they connected with stagecoaches to travel to Wilmington, Philadelphia and other points north. An 1802 attempt to build a canal to connect the Elk River to Christiana, Delaware (connecting the Chesapeake and Delaware watersheds) failed within two years. However, between 1824 and 1829, with financial support from the states of Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, over 2600 workers built the 14 miles long Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which became for a while the busiest canal in the new nation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still operates it today, and Chesapeake City, Maryland, which had been Bohemia Manor until 1839, has a museum explaining the canal's importance. Railroads and bridges also proved economically important to Cecil County and surrounding region. The New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad began service in 1831. Railroads crisscrossed Cecil county within three decades, although they ultimately greatly reduced its importance as a trading center. Cities such as Philadelphia and Baltimore could achieve economies of scale impossible for the county's small Chesapeake ports. Even the railroad's Frenchtown section was abandoned in 1859, and the port became a ghost town, though other sections remain in use, operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway.\nDuring the American Civil War, Perryville, Maryland became an important staging ground for Union troops. It had been the halfway point of the railroad line between Wilmington and Baltimore, but damage to the section into Baltimore caused Union troops to embark ferries at Perryville. No Civil War battles occurred in Cecil County, but residents had strongly divided loyalties. Slavery had declined from 3,400 slaves in the county in 1790 to just 800 in 1850. The Underground Railroad had crossed through Cecil County, perhaps assisted by the 'Fighting Quaker,' former Congressman and U.S. Marshall John Conard, who moved to North East between 1834 and 1851 and was reburied at St. Mary Anne's Episcopal Church there after his death in Philadelphia in 1857. Frederick Douglass crossed Cecil County on his road to freedom in 1838. While Jacob Tome made his fortune in the area and stayed, other Cecil County natives left in search of economic opportunity. David Davis moved to Illinois upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1835, where he became Abraham Lincoln's law partner and later served in that legislature as well as a judge, before moving to Washington D.C. to help President Lincoln, who later named him to the United States Supreme Court. Slavery's abolition affected many local property owners, as well as their slaves. After the war, Perryville again became a railroad town, and later received business from interstate highway travelers crossing the Susquehanna bridges. Although Cecil County had once been one of the wealthiest in Maryland and has worked hard recently to attract industry as well as tourist dollars, the average income of residents is now near that of Americans as a whole.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nFrom the start, Cecil County's future was shaped by its strategic location between the growing cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and New York City. In the 20th century, as modern highways arrived its placement along the heavily traveled northeast corridor brought new opportunities and change to the county. By June 1941, the final segment of the Philadelphia Road, the new dual highway designated as Route 40 was completed across the center of Cecil County. In 1943, the dual highway was dedicated as the Pulaski Highway, to honor the Polish patriot and friend of Revolutionary American, according to \"The Baltimore Sun\". Soon new motels, restaurants, and gas stations started sprouting up along what was once rural fields and woods.\nOn November 14, 1963, President John F. Kennedy visited Cecil County to formally open and dedicate the Northeastern Expressway (I-95). Motorists were relieved to be \"on the clear new road\" one editor noted in \"The Baltimore Sun\". After President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, I-95 was rededicated as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway. As traffic started zipping along the superhighway, without one light halting the fast trip, a corridor that would yield major dividends to the county had opened. It spurred business growth along the route, as commercial, industrial, and residential development clustered near the interchanges in the decades ahead.\nIn 2013, the county became a Second Amendment sanctuary.\nCecil County has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.\nPolitics, government and law.\nIn the early post-Civil War period, Cecil County, having been generally pro-secession, leaned strongly towards the Democratic Party. It was carried by the Democratic Party nominee in every Presidential election between 1868 and 1920 except that of 1896 when the Northeast was vigorously opposed to William Jennings Bryan\u2019s \u201cfree silver\u201d policy. Since Dwight Eisenhower carried the county in 1952, Cecil County has become a solidly Republican county. The last Democrat to carry the county was Jimmy Carter in 1976.\nPrior to December 3, 2012, Cecil County was governed by county commissioners, the traditional form of county government in Maryland. On that date, Cecil County began governance under a new charter approved via voter referendum in November 2010, which authorized an elected county executive and a five-member County Council, which separates the legislative and executive functions of local government (unlike the old \"board of commissioner\" system). Cecil County thus joined most of the other larger, increasingly urban and complex county governments in central Maryland with county executive-county council forms, such as Baltimore, Harford, Anne Arundel, Howard, Prince George's, and Montgomery counties. Elected on November 5, 2024, Adam Streight (R) is the current County Executive.\nIn addition, Cecil County is an area that has some home rule in its towns, in places such as Perryville and North East, who have town governments, and hence have minimal county reliance.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (17%) is water.\nCecil County is in the northeast corner of Maryland, bounded on the north and east by the Mason\u2013Dixon line with Pennsylvania and Delaware. The western border is defined by the lower reaches of the Susquehanna River and the northernmost coves, flats and tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. On the south, the county is bounded by the Sassafras River and Kent County, Maryland. The county is part of the Delmarva Peninsula as well as Maryland's \"Eastern Shore.\"\nTopographically, Cecil County straddles the border between the rolling hills of the Piedmont Plateau north of U.S. Route 40 and the flatlands of the Atlantic Coastal Plain to the south. The highest and most rugged hills are found in the northwestern and north-central parts of the county, reaching just south of the Mason\u2013Dixon line near Nottingham, Pennsylvania and just east of U.S. Route 1. The lowest elevation is sea level along the Chesapeake Bay.\nCecil County is primarily rural, with denser development around the county seat of Elkton and along U.S. Route 40. The county is bisected from east to west by the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which connects the Delaware River to the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Elk River. The canal passes through the town of Chesapeake City, where a high-level bridge facilitates the passage of large ships beneath Maryland Route 213.\nCecil County is also bisected east-to-west by Interstate 95, known as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway in Maryland. The highway provides a major artery for traffic between the Baltimore-Washington area to the southwest and the Philadelphia and New York and New Jersey regions to the northeast. The Office of Management and Budget has designated Cecil County as part of the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington metropolitan area.\nClimate.\nCecil County has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") except in higher northern areas where a hot-summer humid continental climate (\"Dfa\") exists. There are four distinct seasons and seven months average above .) The hardiness zone is mostly 7a.\nTransportation.\nMajor roads and highways.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPublic transportation.\nThe county operates Cecil Transit, which provides fixed-route bus and demand responsive transport service throughout Cecil County.\nThe northern terminus of MARC's Penn Line commuter rail service to Baltimore and Washington, D.C. is in Perryville, Maryland. Recently, the Wilmington Area Planning Council conducted a study on the travel patterns of residents in the county, and they suggested that the MARC line extends from Perryville up to Newark or even Wilmington, where it meets SEPTA and Amtrak lines.\nThe county is one of only two areas on Amtrak's \"Acela\" that does not have local services.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 101,108\u00a0people, 36,867\u00a0households, and 26,681\u00a0families living in the county.

{"id": "57201", "revid": "1319067843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57201", "title": "Harford County, Maryland", "text": "County in Maryland, United States\nHarford County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2020 census, the population was 260,924. Its county seat is Bel Air. Harford County is part of the Baltimore metropolitan area and the Washington\u2013Baltimore combined statistical area. The county is part of the Central Maryland region of the state.\nHistory.\nIn 1608 the area was inhabited by Massawomecks and Susquehannocks. The first European to see the area was John Smith in 1608 when he traveled up the Chesapeake Bay from Jamestown. In 1652, the English and Susquehannocks signed a treaty at what is now Annapolis for the area now called Harford County.\nHarford County was formed on March 22, 1774, from the eastern part of Baltimore County with a population of 13,000 people. On March 22, 1775, Harford County hosted the signers of the Bush Declaration, a precursor document to the American Revolution. On January 22, 1782, Bel Air became the county seat.\nHavre de Grace, a city incorporated in 1785 within Harford County, was once under consideration to be the capital of the United States rather than Washington, D.C. It was favored for its strategic location at the top of the Chesapeake Bay; this location would facilitate trade while being secure in time of war. Today, the waterways around Havre de Grace have become adversely affected by silt runoff, which is one of the primary environmental issues of Harford County. While today the site is a Maryland National Guard military reservation, the land was used as the Havre de Grace Racetrack where racehorse Man o' War ran in 1919 and 1920.\nDuring the 1900s the Bata Shoe Company employed numerous Eastern European refugees at the Belcamp factory. In the 1940s the Susquehanna River tributary Broad Creek was dammed to form the at what is now the Broad Creek Memorial Scout Reservation. In June 1972 Hurricane Agnes overflowed the dam and flooded areas in many states. On the \"County Health Rankings &amp; Roadmaps\" by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, \"prior to the 2016 report ... Harford's yearly rankings typically fell between ninth and 10th place, primarily because of the percentage of county residents who were obese or who smoked.\" Scenes from \"Tuck Everlasting\", \"From Within\", and \"House of Cards\" were all filmed in Harford County.\nIn 2011 the Office of National Drug Control Policy deemed Harford County a designated High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.\nThe county was named for Henry Harford (c. 1759\u20131834), the illegitimate son of Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore. Henry Harford was born to Calvert's mistress, Hester Whelan, whose residence still stands as part of a private residence on Jarretsville Pike, in Phoenix, Maryland. Harford served as the last Proprietary Governor of Maryland but, because of his illegitimacy, did not inherit his father's title. There are 79 properties and districts listed on the National Register in the county, including one National Historic Landmark called Sion Hill.\nEnvironmental history.\nHarford County has environmental issues in three major areas: land use, water pollution/urban runoff, and soil contamination/groundwater contamination.\nAs the county sits at the headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay along the Susquehanna River, it plays a key role in controlling sediment and fertilizer runoff into the bay as well as fostering submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) regrowth. The county has had to balance the needs of land owners to practice agriculture and/or pave land (creating impervious surfaces) with effects of runoff into the bay.\nHarford County has been burdened by soil contamination and groundwater contamination since the creation of the Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1917. The military installation performs research for the U.S. Army, including weapons testing, and has released various chemical agents into soil and groundwater, including mustard gas and perchlorate. The bordering towns of Aberdeen, Edgewood and Joppatowne have been affected by this contamination.\nAberdeen Proving Ground contains three Superfund priority sites as of 2006[ [update]]. Groundwater contamination by MTBE, a mandatory gasoline additive, has also affected Fallston.\nHarford County also faces controversy from residents living near Scarboro Landfill and Harford Waste Disposal Center, the only municipal landfill. The landfill, approved to triple in size in 2007, is the subject of complaints by neighbors of operating violations, such as large areas of open trash and blown litter; leachate breaks which contaminate area residential wells and flow into Deer Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River; and increased health problems.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (17%) is water.\nHarford County straddles the border between the rolling hills of the Piedmont Plateau and the flatlands of the Atlantic Coastal Plain along the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The county's development is a mix of rural and suburban, with denser development in the larger towns of Aberdeen and Bel Air and along Route 40 and other major arteries leading out of Baltimore. The highest elevations are in the north and northwest of the county, reaching 805\u00a0ft. near the Pennsylvania border in the county's northwestern corner. The lowest elevation is sea level along the Chesapeake Bay.\nClimate.\nThe January freezing isotherm runs across the northern part of the county and divides it into a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") and a hot-summer humid continental climate (\"Dfa\".) Average monthly temperatures in Bel Air range from 32.6\u00a0\u00b0F in January to 76.6\u00a0\u00b0F in July, while in Aberdeen they range from 33.5\u00a0\u00b0F in January to 77.2\u00a0\u00b0F in July.\nPolitics and government.\nHarford County is, like the Pennsylvania Dutch Country to its north, a strongly Republican region. No Democratic presidential candidate has carried Harford County since Lyndon Johnson\u2019s landslide of 1964, although recent trends have shown the county voting less Republican over the past few elections. In the period before World War II Harford leaned strongly Democratic as it had sizeable Confederate sympathies, but during and since World War II the county has turned away from its traditional allegiances.\nHarford County was granted a charter form of government in 1972. This means that the county is run by a County Executive and Council President, both elected at large, as well as Council Members, elected from districts. Currently, there are six districts in Harford County. Also elected at large is the Sheriff, who runs the Harford County Sheriff's Office, the State's Attorney, who prosecutes all crimes in the county, the Register of Wills, and the Clerk of the Circuit Court.\nExecutive.\nThe Harford County Executive is Robert Cassilly (Republican). Primary law enforcement in the county is handled by the Harford County Sheriff's Office, which has precincts in Jarrettsville, Edgewood and Bel Air. The current Sheriff is Jeffrey Gahler (R). The Maryland State Police also have a barrack located in Bel Air which serves the citizens of Harford County. Municipal police needs are provided by the Bel Air Police Department, the Aberdeen Police Department and the Havre De Grace Police Department. The current State's Attorney is Alison Healey, the first woman to hold the post. Directors are nominated by the Executive and approved by the council. The Volunteer Fire &amp; EMS Association department is led by Russell Eyre.\nCouncil.\nPatrick Vincenti is the council president. Dion F. Guthrie represents district A which includes Joppa and Edgewood. Aaron David Penman represents district B which includes Abingdon and Fallston. Tony \"G\" Giangiordano represents district C which includes Bel Air and Forest Hill. James Reilly represents district D which includes Jarrettsville, Street, and Darlington. Jessica Boyle-Tsottles represents district E which includes Churchville and Aberdeen. Jacob D. Bennett represents district F which includes Belcamp and Havre de Grace.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 218,590 people, 79,667 households, and 60,387 families residing in the county.

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 166,617. The county seat is La Plata. The county was named for Charles Calvert (1637\u20131715), third Baron Baltimore. The county is part of the Southern Maryland region of the state. With a median household income of $103,678, Charles County is the 39th-wealthiest county in the United States as of 2020, and the highest-income county in the United States with a Black-majority population.\nHistory.\nCharles County was created in 1658 by an Order in Council. There was also an earlier Charles County from 1650 to 1654, sometimes referred to in historic documents as Old Charles County, which consisted largely of lands within today's borders but \"included parts of St. Mary\u2019s, Calvert, present-day Charles, and Prince George\u2019s County\". John Tayloe I purchased land around Nanjemoy Creek after 1710 from which to mine iron and ship to his furnaces at Bristol Iron Works, Neabsco Iron Works and later Occoquan Ironworks.\nIn April 1865, John Wilkes Booth made his escape through Charles County after shooting President Abraham Lincoln. He was on his way to Virginia. He stopped briefly in Waldorf (then called Beantown) and had his broken leg set by local Doctor Samuel Mudd, who was later sent to prison for helping him. Booth then proceeded to hide in the Zekiah Swamp in Charles County, avoiding search parties for over a week until he and his accomplice were able to successfully cross the Potomac River.\nThe 1911 Digges Amendment, which attempted to disenfranchise African Americans in Maryland, was drafted by Democratic state delegate (lower house) Walter Digges and co-sponsored by state senator (upper house) William J. Frere, both from Charles County, Maryland. In Maryland's unrestricted general election of 1911, the Digges Amendment was defeated with 46,220 votes for and 83,920 votes against the proposal. Nationally Maryland citizens achieved the most notable rejection of a black-disfranchising amendment.\nIn 1926, a tornado ripped through the county leaving 17 dead (including 13 schoolchildren). On April 28, 2002, another tornado (rated an F-4) destroyed much of downtown La Plata killing 3 and injuring over 100 people.\nThe county has numerous properties on the National Register of Historic Places. Among them are Green Park and Pleasant Hill, home of the Green and Spalding Families.\nOn December 4, 2004, an arson took place in the development of Hunters Brooke, a few miles southeast of Indian Head. The Hunters Brooke Arson was the largest residential arson in Maryland history.\nPolitics and government.\nOwing to the considerable voting power of its large number of freedmen following the Civil War, and later its growth as a suburban area, Charles County was for a long time solidly Republican. The only Democrat to carry Charles County until 1960 was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, although Alf Landon and Wendell Willkie defeated Roosevelt in the next two elections by a combined margin of just 50 votes. Since the turn of the millennium, Charles County has become reliably Democratic, although not as overwhelmingly so as other parts of Maryland's Washington, D.C. suburbs. Charles County is one of only two counties in the nation to have voted for Al Gore in 2000 after voting for Bob Dole in 1996, along with Orange County, Florida.\nBoard of Commissioners.\nCharles County is governed by county commissioners, the traditional form of county government in Maryland. There are five commissioners. As of 2022[ [update]], they are:\nCharles County is entirely within the 5th Congressional District, which also includes Calvert, St. Mary's, and parts of Anne Arundel and Prince George's counties. The current representative is former Democratic House Majority Leader and former House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (29%) water.\nIn its western wing, along the southernmost bend in Maryland Route 224, Charles County contains a place due north, east, south, and west of the same state\u2014Virginia.\nAdjacent counties.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 146,551\u00a0people, 51,214\u00a0households, and 38,614\u00a0families residing in the county.

{"id": "57212", "revid": "50802124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57212", "title": "TGV", "text": "State-operated intercity high-speed rail service of France\nThe TGV (; , , 'high-speed train') is France's intercity high-speed rail service. With commercial operating speeds of up to on the newer lines, the TGV was conceived at the same period as other technological projects such as the Ariane 1 rocket and Concorde supersonic airliner; sponsored by the Government of France, those funding programmes were known as ('national champion') policies. In 2023 the TGV network in France carried 122 million passengers.\nThe state-owned SNCF started working on a high-speed rail network in 1966. It presented the project to President Georges Pompidou in 1974 who approved it. Originally designed as turbotrains to be powered by gas turbines, TGV prototypes evolved into electric trains with the 1973 oil crisis. In 1976 the SNCF ordered 87 high-speed trains from Alstom. Following the inaugural service between Paris and Lyon in 1981 on the LGV Sud-Est, the network, centred on Paris, has expanded to connect major cities across France, including Marseille, Lille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Rennes and Montpellier, as well as in neighbouring countries on a combination of high-speed and conventional lines. The success of the first high-speed service led to a rapid development of \"lignes \u00e0 grande vitesse\" (LGVs, 'high-speed lines') to the south (Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, N\u00eemes\u2013Montpellier), west (Atlantique, Bretagne-Pays de la Loire, Sud Europe Atlantique), north (Nord, Interconnexion Est) and east (Rhin-Rh\u00f4ne, Est). Since it was launched, the TGV has not recorded a single passenger fatality in an accident on normal, high-speed service.\nA specially modified TGV high-speed train known as Project V150, weighing only 265 tonnes, set the world record for the fastest wheeled train, reaching during a test run on 3 April 2007. In 2007, the world's fastest scheduled rail journey was a start-to-stop average speed of between the Gare de Champagne-Ardenne and Gare de Lorraine on the LGV Est, not surpassed until the 2013 reported average of express service on the Shijiazhuang to Zhengzhou segment of China's Shijiazhuang\u2013Wuhan high-speed railway. During the engineering phase, the transmission voie-machine (TVM) cab-signalling technology was developed, as drivers would not be able to see signals along the track-side when trains reach full speed. It allows for a train engaging in an emergency braking to request within seconds all following trains to reduce their speed; if a driver does not react within , the system overrides the controls and reduces the train's speed automatically. The TVM safety mechanism enables TGVs using the same line to depart every three minutes.\nThe TGV system itself extends to neighbouring countries, either directly (Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany) or through TGV-derivative networks linking France to Switzerland (Lyria), to Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands (former Thalys), as well as to the United Kingdom (Eurostar). Several future lines are under construction or planned, including extensions within France and to surrounding countries. The Mont d'Ambin Base Tunnel, part of the LGV Lyon\u2013Turin which is currently under construction, is set to become the longest rail tunnel in the world. Cities such as Tours and Le Mans have become part of a \"TGV commuter belt\" around Paris; the TGV also serves Charles de Gaulle Airport and Lyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport. A visitor attraction in itself, it stops at Disneyland Paris and in southern tourist cities such as Avignon and Aix-en-Provence as well. Brest, Chamb\u00e9ry, Nice, Toulouse and Biarritz are reachable by TGVs running on a mix of LGVs and modernised lines. In 2007, the SNCF generated profits of \u20ac1.1 billion (approximately US$1.75 billion, \u00a3875 million) driven largely by higher margins on the TGV network.\nHistory.\nThe idea of the TGV was first proposed in 1967, after Japan had begun construction of the Shinkansen in 1959. At the time the Government of France favoured new technology, exploring the production of hovercraft and the A\u00e9rotrain air-cushion vehicle. Simultaneously, the SNCF began researching high-speed trains on conventional tracks. In 1976, the administration agreed to fund the first line. By the mid-1990s, the trains were so popular that SNCF president Louis Gallois declared that the TGV was \"the train that saved French railways\".\nDevelopment.\nIt was originally planned that the TGV, then standing for ' ('very high speed') or ' ('high-speed turbine'), would be propelled by gas turbines, selected for their small size, good power-to-weight ratio and ability to deliver high power over an extended period. The first prototype, TGV 001, was the only gas-turbine TGV: following the increase in the price of oil during the 1973 energy crisis, gas turbines were deemed uneconomic and the project turned to electricity from overhead lines, generated by new nuclear power stations.\nTGV 001 was not a wasted prototype: its gas turbine was only one of its many new technologies for high-speed rail travel. It also tested high-speed brakes, needed to dissipate the large amount of kinetic energy of a train at high speed, high-speed aerodynamics, and signalling. It was articulated, comprising two adjacent carriages sharing a bogie, allowing free yet controlled motion with respect to one another. It reached , which remains the world speed record for a non-electric train. Its interior and exterior were styled by French designer Jacques Cooper, whose work formed the basis of early TGV designs, including the distinctive nose shape of the first power cars.\nChanging the TGV to electric traction required a significant design overhaul. The first electric prototype, nicknamed Z\u00e9bulon, was completed in 1974, testing features such as innovative body mounting of motors, pantographs, suspension and braking. Body mounting of motors allowed over 3\u00a0tonnes to be eliminated from the power cars and greatly reduced the unsprung weight. The prototype travelled almost during testing.\nIn 1976, the French administration funded the TGV project, and construction of the LGV Sud-Est, the first high-speed line (), began shortly afterwards. The line was given the designation LN1, \"\" ('New Line 1'). After two pre-production trainsets (nicknamed \"Patrick\" and \"Sophie\") had been tested and substantially modified, the first production version was delivered on 25 April 1980.\nService.\nThe TGV opened to the public between Paris and Lyon on 27 September 1981. Contrary to its earlier fast services, SNCF intended TGV service for all types of passengers, with the same initial ticket price as trains on the parallel conventional line. To counteract the popular misconception that the TGV would be a premium service for business travellers, SNCF started a major publicity campaign focusing on the speed, frequency, reservation policy, normal price, and broad accessibility of the service. This commitment to a democratised TGV service was enhanced in the Mitterrand era with the promotional slogan \"Progress means nothing unless it is shared by all\". The TGV was considerably faster (in terms of door to door travel time) than normal trains, cars, or aeroplanes. The trains became widely popular, the public welcoming fast and practical travel.\nThe Eurostar service began operation in 1994, connecting continental Europe to London via the Channel Tunnel and the LGV Nord-Europe with a version of the TGV designed for use in the tunnel and the United Kingdom. The first phase of the British High Speed 1 line was completed in 2003, the second phase in November 2007. The fastest trains take 2\u00a0hours 15\u00a0minutes London\u2013Paris and 1\u00a0hour 51\u00a0minutes London\u2013Brussels. The first twice-daily London-Amsterdam service ran 3 April 2018, and took 3\u00a0hours 47\u00a0minutes.\nMilestones.\nThe TGV (1981) was the world's second commercial and the fastest standard gauge high-speed train service, after Japan's Shinkansen, which connected Tokyo and Osaka from 1 October 1964. It was a commercial success. \nA TGV test train holds the world speed record for conventional trains. On 3 April 2007 a modified TGV POS train reached under test conditions on the LGV Est between Paris and Strasbourg. The line voltage was boosted to 31 kV, and extra ballast was tamped onto the permanent way. The train beat the 1990 world speed record of , set by a similarly TGV, along with unofficial records set during weeks preceding the official record run. The test was part of an extensive research programme by Alstom.\nIn 2007, the TGV was the world's fastest conventional scheduled train: one journey's average start-to-stop speed from Champagne-Ardenne Station to Lorraine Station is .\nThis record was surpassed on 26 December 2009 by the new Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway in China where the fastest scheduled train covered at an average speed of .\nA Eurostar (TGV) train broke the record for the longest non-stop high-speed international journey on 17 May 2006 carrying the cast and filmmakers of \"The Da Vinci Code\" from London to Cannes for the Cannes Film Festival. The journey took 7\u00a0hours 25\u00a0minutes on an average speed of .\nThe fastest single long-distance run on the TGV was done by a TGV R\u00e9seau train from Calais-Frethun to Marseille (i) in 3\u00a0hours 29\u00a0minutes at a speed of for the inauguration of the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e on 26 May 2001.\nPassenger usage.\nOn 28 November 2003, the TGV network carried its one billionth passenger, a distant second only to the Shinkansen's five billionth passenger in 2000.\nExcluding international traffic, the TGV system carried 98 million passengers during 2008, an increase of 8 million (9.1%) on the previous year.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nRolling stock.\nAll TGV trains have two power cars, one on each end. Between those power cars are a set of semi-permanently coupled articulated un-powered coaches. Cars are connected with Jacobs bogies, a single bogie shared between the ends of two coaches. The only exception are the end cars, which have a standalone bogie on the side closest to the power car, which is often motorized. Power cars also have two bogies.\nTrains can be lengthened by coupling two TGVs, using couplers hidden in the noses of the power cars. \nThe articulated design is advantageous during a derailment, as the passenger carriages are more likely to stay upright and in line with the track. Normal trains could split at couplings and jackknife, as seen in the Eschede train disaster. A disadvantage is that it is difficult to split sets of carriages. While power cars can be removed from trains by standard uncoupling procedures, specialized equipment is needed to split carriages, by lifting up cars off a bogie. Once uncoupled, one of the carriage ends is left without support, so a specialized frame is required.\nSNCF prefers to use power cars instead of electric multiple units because it allows for less electrical equipment.\nThere are six types of TGV equipment in use, all built by Alstom:\nRetired sets:\nSeveral TGV types have broken records, including the V150 and TGV 001. V150 was a specially modified five-car double-deck trainset that reached under controlled conditions on a test run. It narrowly missed beating the world train speed record of . The record-breaking speed is impractical for commercial trains due to motor overcharging, empty train weight, rail and engine wear issues, elimination of all but three coaches, excessive vibration, noise and lack of emergency stopping methods. TGVs travel at up to in commercial use. \nAll TGVs are at least \"bi-current\", which means that they can operate at (used on LGVs) and (used on traditional lines). Trains travelling internationally must accommodate other voltages (15\u00a0kV \u200a16.7\u00a0Hz AC or ), requiring \"tri-current\" and \"quad-current\" TGVs. \nEach TGV power car has two pantographs: one for AC use and one for DC. When passing between areas with different electric systems (identified by marker boards), trains enter a phase break zone. Just before this section, train operators must power down the motors (allowing the train to coast), lower the pantograph, adjust a switch to select the appropriate system, and raise the pantograph. Once the train exits the phase break zone and detects the correct electric supply, a dashboard indicator illuminates, and the operator can once again engage the motors. \nTGV Sud-Est.\nThe Sud-Est fleet was built between 1978 and 1988 and operated the first TGV service, from Paris to Lyon in 1981. There were 107 passenger sets, of which nine are tri-current (including 15\u00a0kV \u200a16.7\u00a0Hz AC for use in Switzerland) and the rest bi-current. There were seven bi-current half-sets without seats that carried mail for La Poste between Paris, Lyon and Provence, in a distinctive yellow livery until they were phased out in 2015.\nEach set were made up of two power cars and eight carriages (capacity 345 seats), including a powered bogie in the carriages adjacent to the power cars. They are long and wide. They weighed with a power output of 6,450\u00a0kW under 25\u00a0kV.\nThe sets were originally built to run at but most were upgraded to during mid-life refurbishment in preparation for the opening of the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. The few sets that kept a maximum speed of operated on routes that include a comparatively short distance on LGV, such as to Switzerland via Dijon; SNCF did not consider it financially worthwhile to upgrade their speed for a marginal reduction in journey time.\nIn December 2019, the trains were phased out from service. In late 2019 and early 2020, TGV 01 (Nicknamed Patrick), the very first TGV train, did a farewell service that included all three liveries that were worn during their service.\nTGV Atlantique.\nThe 105 train Atlantique fleet was built between 1988 and 1992 for the opening of the LGV Atlantique and entry into service began in 1989. They are all bi-current, long and wide. They weigh and are made up of two power cars and ten carriages with a capacity of 485 seats. They were built with a maximum speed of and 8,800\u00a0kW of power under 25\u00a0kV. The efficiency of the Atlantique with all seats filled has been calculated at 767 PMPG, though with a typical occupancy of 60% it is about 460 PMPG (a Toyota Prius with three passengers is 144 PMPG).\nModified unit 325 set the world speed record in 1990 on the LGV Atlantique before its opening. Modifications such as improved aerodynamics, larger wheels and improved braking were made to enable speeds of over . The set was reduced to two power cars and three carriages to improve the power-to-weight ratio, weighing 250 tonnes. Three carriages, including the bar carriage in the centre, is the minimum possible configuration because of the Jacobs bogies.\nTGV R\u00e9seau.\nThe first R\u00e9seau (Network) sets entered service in 1993. Fifty bi-current sets were ordered in 1990, supplemented by 40 tri-current sets in 1992/1993 (adding system used on traditional lines in Belgium). Ten tri-current sets carry the Eurostar Red (ex-Thalys) livery and are known as the PBA (Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam) sets.\nThey are formed of two power cars (8,800\u00a0kW under 25\u00a0kV \u2013 as TGV Atlantique) and eight carriages, giving a capacity of 377 seats. They have a top speed of . They are long and are wide. The bi-current sets weigh 383 tonnes: owing to axle-load restrictions in Belgium the tri-current sets have a series of modifications, such as the replacement of steel with aluminum and hollow axles, to reduce the weight to under 17 t per axle.\nOwing to early complaints of uncomfortable pressure changes when entering tunnels at high speed on the LGV Atlantique, the R\u00e9seau sets are now pressure-sealed. They can be coupled to a Duplex set.\nTGV Duplex.\nThe Duplex was built to increase TGV capacity without increasing train length or the number of trains. Each carriage has two levels, with access doors at the lower level taking advantage of low French platforms. A staircase gives access to the upper level, where the gangway between carriages is located. There are 512 seats per set. On busy routes such as Paris-Marseille they are operated in pairs, providing 1,024 seats in two Duplex sets or 800 in a Duplex set plus a Reseau set. Each set has a wheelchair accessible compartment.\nAfter a lengthy development process starting in 1988 (during which they were known as the TGV-2N) the original batch of 30 was built between 1995 and 1998. Further deliveries started in 2000 with the Duplex fleet now totaling 160 units, making it the backbone of the SNCF TGV-fleet. They weigh 380 tonnes and are long, made up of two power cars and eight carriages. Extensive use of aluminum means that they weigh not much more than the TGV R\u00e9seau sets they supplement. The bi-current power cars provide 8,800\u00a0kW, and they have a slightly increased speed of .\nDuplex TGVs run on all of French high-speed lines.\nTGV POS.\nTGV POS (Paris-Ostfrankreich-S\u00fcddeutschland or Paris-Eastern France-Southern Germany) are used on the LGV Est.\nThey consist of two Duplex power cars with eight TGV R\u00e9seau-type carriages, with a power output of 9,600\u00a0kW and a top speed of . Unlike TGV-A, TGV-R and TGV-D, they have asynchronous motors, and isolation of an individual motor is possible in case of failure.\nAvelia Euroduplex (TGV 2N2).\nThe bi-current TGV 2N2 (Avelia Euroduplex) can be regarded as the 3rd generation of Duplex. The series was commissioned from December 2011 for links to Germany and Switzerland (tri-current trains) and to cope with the increased traffic due to the opening of the LGV Rhine-Rhone.\nThey are numbered from 800 and are limited to . ERTMS makes them compatible to allow access to Spain similar to Dasye.\nTGV M Avelia Horizon.\nThe design that emerged from the process was named TGV M, and in July 2018 SNCF ordered 100 trainsets with deliveries expected to begin in 2024. They are expected to cost \u20ac25 million per 8-car set.\nTGV technology outside France.\nTGV technology has been adopted in a number of other countries:\nLines in operation.\nIn June 2021, there were approximately of \"\" (LGV), with four additional line sections under construction. The current lines and those under construction can be grouped into four routes radiating from Paris.\nAccidents.\nIn over four decades of operation, the TGV has not recorded a single passenger fatality in an accident on normal, high-speed service. There have been several accidents, including four derailments at or above , but in only one of these\u2014a test run on a new line\u2014did carriages overturn.\nThis safety record is credited in part to the stiffness that the articulated design lends to the train. There have been fatal accidents involving TGVs on \"lignes classiques\", where the trains are exposed to the same dangers as normal trains, such as level crossings. These include one terrorist bombing unrelated to the speed at which the train was traveling.\nOn classic lines.\nFollowing the number of accidents at level crossings, an effort has been made to remove all level crossings on \"lignes classiques\" used by TGVs. The \"ligne classique\" from Tours to Bordeaux at the end of the LGV Atlantique has no level crossings as a result.\nProtests against the TGV.\nThe first environmental protests against the building of an LGV occurred in May 1990 during the planning stages of the LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. Protesters blocked a railway viaduct to protest against the planned route, arguing that it was unnecessary, and that trains could keep using existing lines to reach Marseille from Lyon.\nThe Turin\u2013Lyon high-speed railway (Lyon-Chamb\u00e9ry-Turin), which would connect the TGV network to the Italian TAV network, has been the subject of demonstrations in Italy. While most Italian political parties agree on the construction of this line, some inhabitants of the towns where construction would take place oppose it vehemently. The concerns put forward by the protesters centre on storage of dangerous materials mined during tunnel boring, like asbestos and perhaps uranium, in the open air. This health danger could be avoided by using more expensive techniques for handling radioactive materials. A six-month delay in the start of construction has been decided in order to study solutions. In addition to the concerns of the residents, RFB \u2013 a ten-year-old national movement \u2013 opposes the development of Italy's TAV high-speed rail network as a whole.\nGeneral complaints about the noise of TGVs passing near towns and villages have led the SNCF to build acoustic fencing along large sections of LGV to reduce the disturbance to residents, but protests still take place where SNCF has not addressed the issue.\nOn July 26 2024, the opening day of the 2024 Olympics, the TGV was hit by an arson attack. At least 800,000 people were affected by this. The Eurostar was specifically hit by this with 25% of trains canceled.\nMail services.\nIn addition to its standard services, mail delivery services were also operated by TGVs.\nFor many years, a service termed SNCF TGV La Poste transported mail for the French mail service, La Poste. It used windowless but otherwise standard TGV rolling stock, painted in the yellow and blue livery of La Poste. However, the service ceased in June 2015.\nMobile hospital service.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, several TGV trains were transformed into mobile hospitals, in order to transport critically ill patients from overwhelmed hospitals in the East of France to hospitals in the West.\nEvery coach allowed for up to 6 patients, allowing for the transport of several dozen patients, attended by a staff of 50 medical workers. Although the train moves at high speed, it accelerates and decelerates smoothly, allowing for medical procedures to be performed during transport.\nRebranding.\nSince July 2017, TGV services are gradually being rebranded as TGV inOui and Ouigo in preparation for the opening of the French HSR market to competition.\nTGV inOui.\nTGV inOui is SNCF's premium high-speed rail service. The name inOui was chosen because it sounds like the French word \"inou\u00ef\" meaning \"extraordinary\" (or more literally, \"unheard of\").\nOuigo.\nOuigo is SNCF's low-cost high-speed rail service. Trains have a high-density one-class configuration and reduced on-board services. The services traditionally operate from less busy secondary stations, sometimes outside of the city centre. The literal translation of the brand name is \"yes go\", but the name is also a play on the English homonym, \"we go\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "57215", "revid": "31192532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57215", "title": "Th\u00e9ophile Gautier", "text": "French poet, dramatist and novelist (1811\u20131872)\nPierre Jules Th\u00e9ophile Gautier ( ; ; 30 August 1811 \u2013 23 October 1872) was a French poet, dramatist, novelist, journalist, and art and literary critic.\nWhile an ardent defender of Romanticism, Gautier's work is difficult to classify and remains a point of reference for many subsequent literary traditions such as Parnassianism, Symbolism, Decadence and Modernism. He was widely esteemed by writers as disparate as Balzac, Baudelaire, the Goncourt brothers, Flaubert, Pound, Eliot, James, Proust and Wilde.\nLife and times.\nGautier was born on 30 August 1811 in Tarbes, capital of Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es d\u00e9partement (southwestern France). His father was Jean-Pierre Gautier, a fairly cultured minor government official, and his mother was Antoinette-Adela\u00efde Cocard. The family moved to Paris in 1814, taking up residence in the ancient Marais district.\nGautier's education commenced at the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge Louis-le-Grand in Paris, which he attended for three months before being brought home due to illness. Although he completed the remainder of his education at Coll\u00e8ge Charlemagne, Gautier's most significant instruction, including in Latin, came from his father.\nWhile at school, Gautier befriended G\u00e9rard de Nerval and the two became lifelong friends. It is through Nerval that Gautier was introduced to Victor Hugo, by then already a leading dramatist. Hugo became a major influence on Gautier. It was at the legendary premiere of Hugo's \"Hernani\" that Gautier is remembered for wearing his anachronistic red doublet.\nIn the aftermath of the 1830 Revolution, Gautier's family experienced hardship and was forced to move to the outskirts of Paris. Deciding to experiment with his own independence and freedom, Gautier chose to stay with friends in the Doyenn\u00e9 district of Paris.\nTowards the end of 1830, Gautier began to frequent meetings of \"Le Petit C\u00e9nacle\" (The Little Art Circle), a group of artists who met in the studio of Jehan Du Seigneur. The group was a more irresponsible version of Hugo's \"C\u00e9nacle\". Among its members were the artists G\u00e9rard de Nerval, Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re, Petrus Borel, Alphonse Brot, and Philoth\u00e9e O\u2019Neddy. \"Le Petit C\u00e9nacle\" soon gained a reputation for extravagance and eccentricity.\nGautier began writing poetry as early as 1826, but the majority of his life was spent as a contributor to various journals, mainly \"La Presse\", which also gave him the opportunity for foreign travel and for meeting many influential contacts in high society and the world of the arts. Throughout his life, Gautier was well-travelled, taking trips to Spain, Italy, Russia, Egypt and Algeria. Gautier's many travels inspired many of his writings including \"Voyage en Espagne\" (1843), \"Tr\u00e9sors d\u2019Art de la Russie\" (1858), and \"Voyage en Russie\" (1867). Gautier's travel literature is considered by many as being some of the best from the nineteenth century; often written in a personal style, it provides a window into Gautier's own tastes in art and culture.\nGautier was a celebrated \"abandonn\u00e9\" (one who yields or abandons himself to something) of the Romantic Ballet, writing several scenarios, the most famous of which is \"Giselle\", whose first interpreter, the ballerina Carlotta Grisi, was the great love of his life. When Carlotta rebuffed him, he began a long-term relationship and had two daughters with her sister Ernestina, a singer.\nAbsorbed by the 1848 Revolution, Gautier wrote almost one hundred articles, equivalent to four large books, within nine months in 1848. In his essay \"La R\u00e9publique de l'avenir\", he celebrated the advent of the new republic and the onward march of individual liberty. Gautier experienced a prominent time in his life when the original romantics such as Hugo, Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred de Vigny and Alfred de Musset were no longer actively participating in the literary world. His prestige was confirmed by his role as director of \"Revue de Paris\" from 1851 to 1856. During this time, Gautier left \"La Presse\" and became a journalist for \"Le Moniteur universel\", finding the burden of regular journalism quite unbearable and \"humiliating\". Nevertheless, Gautier acquired the editorship of the influential review \"L\u2019Artiste\" in 1856. It is in this review that Gautier publicized \"Art for art's sake\" doctrines through many editorials.\nThe 1860s were years of assured literary fame for Gautier. Although he was rejected by the French Academy three times (1867, 1868, 1869), Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve, the most influential critic of the day, set the seal of approval on the poet by devoting no less than three major articles in 1863 to reviews of Gautier's entire published works. In 1865, Gautier was admitted into the prestigious salon of Princess Mathilde Bonaparte, cousin of Napoleon III and niece to Bonaparte. The Princess offered Gautier a sinecure as her librarian in 1868, a position that gave him access to the court of Napoleon III.\nElected in 1862 as chairman of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts, he was surrounded by a committee of important painters: Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, \u00c9douard Manet, Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse and Gustave Dor\u00e9.\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War, Gautier made his way back to Paris upon hearing of the Prussian advance on the capital. He remained with his family throughout the invasion and the aftermath of the Commune, eventually dying at the age of 61 on 23 October 1872 due to a long-standing cardiac disease. He is interred at the in Paris.\nIn 1873, A. Lemerre published a collection of memorial poems, \"Le Tombeau de Th\u00e9ophile Gautier\", with homages by Anatole France, Victor Hugo, Algernon Swinburne, and many others.\nPersonal life.\nThe young Gautier's appearance was \"flamboyant\u2026defying conventionality by his flowing hair and far-famed scarlet waistcoat.\"\nIn his youth, according to Edgar Saltus, Gautier was dashing, athletic, amorous, and mercurial:He was tall and robust; his hair was a wayward flood; his eyes were blue and victorious. He was the image of Young France. His strength was proverbial; he outdid Dante; he swam from Marseilles to the Chateau d\u2019If, and then swam back. [...] women fell in love with him at once.\nFrom an affair with Eug\u00e9nie Fort, he had a son, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, fils. From a subsequent relationship with the singer Ernesta Grisi (sister of the dancer Carlotta Grisi), he had two daughters, Judith Gautier and Estelle Gautier.\nDespite his attraction to \"mystery, legend, tradition, the picturesque and the imaginative,\" and the occasional \"excursion into the realms of the beyond,\" Gautier did not practice any established religion.\nCriticism.\nGautier spent the majority of his career as a journalist at \"La Presse\" and later at \"Le Moniteur universel\". He saw journalistic criticism as a means to a middle-class standard of living. The income was adequate and he had ample opportunities to travel. Gautier began contributing art criticism to obscure journals as early as 1831. It was not until 1836 that he experienced a jump in his career when he was hired by \u00c9mile de Girardin as an art and theatre columnist for \"La Presse\". During his time at \"La Presse\", however, Gautier also contributed nearly 70 articles to \"Le Figaro\". After leaving \"La Presse\" to work for \"Le Moniteur universel\", the official newspaper of the Second Empire, Gautier wrote both to inform the public and to influence its choices. His role at the newspaper was equivalent to the modern book or theatre reviewer. He also reviewed music, without technical terminology but with intelligence and insight, for instance into the work of his friend Berlioz, who set six of his poems (c. 1840) as \"Les Nuits d'\u00e9t\u00e9\".\nLater in life, he wrote extensive monographs on G\u00e9rard de Nerval, Balzac and Baudelaire, some of whom were also his friends. His essay on 15th-century French poet Fran\u00e7ois Villon was key to the revival of attention to his work. Gautier was the first critic to recognize the work of Paul Verlaine, coining the term \"po\u00e8te maudit\" (outcast poet) to characterize his outsider poetics. Baudelaire dedicated his collected poems, \"Les Fleurs du mal\" to him.\nArt criticism.\nGautier started as a painter and later turned to art criticism. He was strongly committed to Denis Diderot's idea that the critic should have the ability to describe the art such that the reader might \"see\" the art through his description. In 1862 he was elected chairman of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts (National Society of Fine Arts) with a board which included Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, \u00c9douard Manet, Gustave Dor\u00e9 and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.\nLiterary criticism.\nIn Gautier's literary criticism, he made a clear distinction between prose and poetry, stating that prose should never be considered the equal of poetry. The bulk of Gautier's criticism, however, was journalistic.\nTheatre criticism.\nThe majority of Gautier's career was spent writing a weekly column of theatrical criticism. He suggested that the normal five acts of a play could be reduced to three: an exposition, a complication, and a d\u00e9nouement. Having abandoned the idea that tragedy is the superior genre, Gautier was later willing to accept comedy as the equal of tragedy. Taking it a step further, he suggested that the nature of the theatrical effect should be in favour of creating fantasy rather than portraying reality because realistic theatre was undesirable.\nDance criticism.\nThe American writer Edwin Denby, considered by some to be the most significant writer about dance in the 20th century, claimed Gautier to be a great dance writer. Through his authorship of the scenario of the ballet Giselle, one of the foundation works of the dance repertoire, his influence remains as great among choreographers and dancers as among critics and devotees of ballet.\nIn 2011, Pacific Northwest Ballet presented a reconstruction of the work as close to its narrative and choreographic sources as possible, based on archival materials dating back to 1842, the year after its premiere.\nWorks.\nIn many of Gautier's works, the subject is less important than the pleasure of telling the story. He favoured a provocative yet refined style. This list links each year of publication with its corresponding \"[year] in poetry\" article, for poetry, or \"[year] in literature\" article for other works):\nPlays.\nGautier did not consider himself to be a dramatist but more of a poet and storyteller. His plays were limited because of the time in which he lived; during the Revolution of 1848, many theatres were closed down and therefore plays were scarce. Most of the plays that dominated the mid-century were written by playwrights who insisted on conformity and conventional formulas and catered to cautious middle-class audiences. As a result, most of Gautier's plays were never published or reluctantly accepted.\nBetween the years 1839 and 1850, Gautier wrote all or part of nine different plays:\nThe travels of Th\u00e9ophile Gautier Vol 4\nTravels in Russia Vol 1\nGautier in fiction.\nTwo poems from \"\u00c9maux et cam\u00e9es\"\u2014\"Sur les lagunes\" and the second of two titled \"\u00c9tudes de Mains\"\u2014are featured in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". Dorian reads them out of the book shortly after Basil Hallward's murder.\nErnest Fanelli's \"Tableaux Symphoniques\" are based on Gautier's novel \"Le Roman de la Momie\".\nIn \"Peter Whiffle\" by Carl Van Vechten, the main character Peter Whiffle cites Gautier as a great influence and writer, among others.\nChronology of works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Counties in the Appalachian Mountains were less conducive to large-scale plantation farming that utilized slave labor and thus were more resistant to secession from the Union. Clinton County, being located on the western foothills of the Cumberland Plateau, reflected this with its voting patterns, having voted Republican even through the several party realignments since Reconstruction. Relative to population, Clinton County was a leader in providing soldiers for the Union Army during the U.S. Civil War, seeing 12.54% of its white population volunteer for Union service, exceeded only by the now-similarly Republican Owsley, Estill and Clay counties.\nThe last Democrat to carry Clinton County was Horatio Seymour in 1868 \u2013 when party realignment was just beginning \u2013 and the last Democrat to pass so much as 30 percent of the county's vote was Grover Cleveland in 1888. Nor has any Republican in this time span \u2013 even William Howard Taft during the divided 1912 election \u2013 fallen short of 60 percent. Jackson County is the only other county in the United States that has seen no Democrat reach 30 percent since the beginning of the 1890s, and apart from these two only Hooker County, Nebraska has seen no Democrat reach 30 percent since 1940.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This became known as the Fairplay System. Most of the rulings seem to have dealt with property issues, but they dealt with any legal or criminal cases in their area.

It has proximity to Lake Oconee, Lake Sinclair, and the Oconee River, all of which are recreation sites, as well as to major employment centers such as Atlanta, Athens, and Macon.\nHistory.\nPutnam County is named in honor of Israel Putnam, a hero of the French and Indian War and a general in the American Revolutionary War. It was settled by European Americans after the war, as migrants moved down from the Upper South. The county was created on December 10, 1807, by an act of the Georgia General Assembly.\nFollowing the invention of the cotton gin, which could profitably process short-staple cotton, the county was developed for cotton cultivation of that type. It thrived in the upland areas, where plantations were developed and worked by the field labor of thousands of African-American slaves.\nDuring the 1919 Red Summer there were many incidents of racial violence including an arson attack where almost a dozen black community buildings were burnt down in late May 1919. \"The Wheeling Intelligencer\" claimed the buildings were burnt down because of a \"minor racial clash at Dennis Station.\" During this time armed black and white mobs patrolled the area in fear of each other.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, thousands of blacks left the state during the Great Migration from 1920 to 1960. The county population dropped by more than half during this period following mechanization of agriculture and as rural workers moved into cities. Since the late 20th century, population has increased.

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 36,726. The county seat is Greencastle. The county was named for Israel Putnam, a hero in the French and Indian War and a general in the American Revolutionary War. The county was created in 1821 and organized in April 1822.\nHistory.\nAfter the American Revolutionary War established US sovereignty over the territory of the upper Midwest, the new federal government defined the Northwest Territory in 1787 which included the area of present-day Indiana. In 1800, Congress separated Ohio from the Northwest Territory, designating the rest of the land as the Indiana Territory. President Thomas Jefferson chose William Henry Harrison as the governor of the territory, and Vincennes was established as the future capital. After the Michigan Territory was separated and the Illinois Territory was formed, Indiana was reduced to its current size and geography. In late 1816, the Indiana Territory was admitted to the Union as a state, although much of its territory was still in dispute as to possession by Native Americans. The land containing Putnam County was brought into the possession and control of the United States by the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1818 (known as the New Purchase).\nThe first county to be organized (1790) in the Northwest Territory was Knox, covering the western part of the future state, with its territory gradually reduced as pockets of settlement allowed the creation of smaller counties. After the Indiana Territory was admitted to the Union as a state on December 11, 1816, Sullivan (December 30, 1816), Vigo (January 21, 1818), and Daviess (February 2, 1818) counties were created, followed by Owen County on December 21, 1818. By 1821, the northern parts of Owen and Vigo counties were sufficiently settled to allow the creation of a new county, which was authorized on December 21, 1821, by an act of the Indiana General Assembly. The act tasked five commissioners to meet in May 1822 at the home of James Athey, a log cabin located at the forks of the Eel River. The act also authorized a circuit court to meet at Athey's cabin, which was likely the first such log structure in the county (having been built by the fall of 1818 on a small section of the southwest corner of what became Putnam County, located just south of land encompassed by the 1818 Treaty of St. Mary's). Records show the court met in session at Athey's cabin in June 1822 and again that September, but the assigned commissioners failed to accomplish their task of selecting a county seat. In January 1823, a second group of commissioners was assigned by the legislature to select the county seat by that April, which they accomplished with the designation of Greencastle, located at the geographic center of the county. An incentive was 70 acres of ground donated for the county seat at Greencastle by Ephraim and Rebecca Dukes, who conveyed the corresponding deed in September 1823.\nThe county's boundary was changed on February 12, 1825, when Clay County was created. It has retained its present configuration since that time.\nGeography.\nThe terrain of northern Putnam County is mostly flat; rolling hills become more evident in the center and southwest portions. At the time of settlement, the county was completely tree-covered (poplar, oak, walnut, maple, beech, and hickory), but presently the flat portions have been cleared and used for agriculture; the drainage areas are still wooded. Walnut Creek drains the east central part of the county, flowing south-southwestward into Owen County. Big Walnut Creek drains the upper part of the county, flowing southwestward into Parke County, where it is captured in the Cecil M. Harden Lake. The highest point in the county ( ASL) is a gradual rise SW of Bainbridge.\nLimestone deposits were extracted beginning in the nineteenth century, and a large iron-ore vein southwest of Cloverdale was discovered in the 1860s.\nAccording to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.55%) is land and (or 0.45%) is water.\nAdjacent counties.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTowns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnincorporated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTownships.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMajor highways.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate and weather.\nIn recent years, average temperatures in Greencastle have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in January 1985 and a record high of was recorded in July 1954.

Representatives are elected to four-year terms from county districts. They set salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state-level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.\nBoard of Commissioners: The executive body of the county; commissioners are elected county-wide to staggered four-year terms.

The commissioners execute acts legislated by the council, collect revenue, and manage the county government.\nCourt:\nCounty Officials: The county has other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. These officers are elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and to be residents of the county.

In May 2014, the nearly park on Greencastle's far east side was deeded to the city of Greencastle. The park offers baseball, softball, and little league fields along with soccer fields, a walking trail, picnic tables, Frisbee golf, and a new dog park.\nCagles Mill Lake.\nIn 1952, Cagles Mill Lake was built as Indiana's first flood\u2212control reservoir, protecting the Eel and White river watersheds. Mill Creek feeds the lake and is home to Cataract Falls. In the 1800s, the future Lieber State Recreation Area was populated by the Miami, Shawnee, and Potawatomi. In 1809, what was left of the great Miami Indian Confederacy sold the now southern one-third of Indiana to the US government, when the 10 O'Clock Treaty Line, which passes through Lieber SRA, was laid out.\nDePauw University Nature Park.\nThe DePauw Nature Park is a moderately trafficked loop trail that features a lake, wildlife, and bird-watching. The trails are rated as moderate, offer a number of activity options, and are accessible year-round. Between 1917 and 1977, the site was a limestone quarry owned and operated by Hanson Aggregates. With the quarry dormant for decades, Hanson Aggregates donated of the land and leased the remaining to DePauw University for $1 per year for 99 years. DePauw acquired the adjacent property to increase the total size of the Nature Park to . DePauw commissioned Mansur Developers in 2002 to design a master plan for possible uses of the nature park. DePauw completed phase 1 of the master plan in 2004 and opened the Nature Park to the public in September 2004.\nFern Cliff.\nFern Cliff and its sandstone cliffs have long been a popular Indiana refuge. Steep forested sandstone cliffs, lush wooded ravines, and a profusion of ferns and bryophytes characterize the preserve. The preserve is open for hiking, photography, and bird watching on its moderate to rugged terrain.\nGlenn Flint Lake.\nLocated in Putnam County north-northwest of Greencastle, the Glenn Flint Lake is home to a relatively new population of game fish, including panfish. Lake renovation in 1995 removed large numbers of carp, so the bluegills and crappies are now doing well. The Little Walnut Creek Conservancy District owns the lake. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) manages the fishery at Glenn Flint.\nGreencastle People Pathways.\nPeople Pathways is a planning and implementation group established with the approval of the Greencastle Park Board of Commissioners. People Pathways has developed a multi-use recreation trail plan. The paths connect public spaces such as schools, parks, libraries, and community resources. Implementation of the People Pathways plan is being done in phases as opportunities develop.\nLincoln Park Speedway.\nLincoln Park Speedway is located in Putnamville and features Nonwing Sprint Cars, UMP Modifieds, UMP Super Stocks, and Bombers at weekly racing events on Saturday nights.\nPutnam Park Road Course.\nThe Putnam Park Road Course is a , 10-turn road course that opened in 1992. The facility is located west of Indianapolis and is open for club events and professional team testing.\nPutnam County Playhouse.\nThe Putnam County Playhouse was organized in 1961 by Greencastle residents, \"to provide the people of the county and the surrounding area with the opportunity to participate in and enjoy live theatre.\" For the first seasons, the plays and musicals were presented in various venues around the Greencastle. For the seasons of 1981 and 1982, plays and musicals were presented on an outdoor stage with bleacher seating. By 1983, the funds had been raised to convert a larger structure, a barn built in 1918, into an intimate 220-seat theater. The Hazel Day Longden Barn Theatre had its grand opening on June 4, 1983. Past performers presented a program of scenes and songs that had been produced by the PCP in its early years. In 1993, extensive work was done on the physical plant. A fly area was added and a new workshop and costume loft were constructed. The following year, a moderate cooling system was added and posts in the auditorium were removed. In April 2000, aluminum siding was added to the barn. Most recently, the seating system was completely replaced and the theater now has 198 seats.\nThe Putnam County Playhouse is active from June through September, presenting two musicals and two plays. Every other year, a children's workshop play is also produced.\nEducation.\nSchool districts include:\nThe Greencastle district operates Greencastle High School.\nAthletics.\nPutnam County offers many athletics:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The following year a portion of Putnam was removed to form Dodge County. Both Putnam and Dodge extended nearly nine miles further north until an 1851 ruling by the Supreme Court on a border dispute with Iowa assigned the contested land to Iowa. Both counties were left with less than the statutory minimum area for a county as set by the state legislature, so Dodge County was dissolved and its area added to Putnam.\nIn its early years, the county seat changed frequently, often with contentious debate. Putnamville, Bryant Station (both no longer in existence), and Hartford all served until a central location called Harmony, later renamed Unionville, was chosen.\nIn the 1860 U.S. Census Putnam County had 9,240 residents, with eighteen sawmills and three flour mills. Coal had been an abundant since its earliest settlement. Following the arrival of the Burlington &amp; Southwestern Railway in 1873, coal mining became a major industry, especially in the east of the county. At one time three railroads crossed Putnam county: the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul; the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy; and the Iowa and St. Louis.

As of the 2020 census, its population was 57,440. Its county seat is Winfield, its largest incorporated city is Hurricane, and its largest community is the census-designated place of Teays Valley. Putnam County is part of the Huntington\u2013Ashland, WV-KY-OH metropolitan statistical area, across the Kanawha River from Charleston, West Virginia.\nHistory.\nThe Virginia General Assembly formed Putnam County on March 11, 1848, from parts of Cabell, Kanawha, and Mason Counties. It was named for Israel Putnam, who was a hero in the French and Indian War and a general in the American Revolutionary War. George Washington surveyed the area in 1770. Winfield, the county seat, had been founded in 1818, but was incorporated on February 21, 1868, and named to honor General Winfield Scott, a general during the Mexican American War and the early stage of the Civil War.\nSlavery was a divisive issue in Putnam County before and during the Civil War. In the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, Putnam County voters elected James W. Hoge to represent them, and he voted against secession on April 17, 1861, when the convention passed the secession ordinance. He returned to Richmond for the second session in June, though, and signed the ordinance. No one from Putnam County attended the Wheeling Convention, which ultimately led to the creation of the state of West Virginia in 1863.\nTwo minor battles were fought in Putnam County during the Civil War. On July 17, 1861, Confederate soldiers defeated a Union force at the Battle of Scary Creek, before withdrawing to Charleston. The Confederates included a cavalry troop raised by Colonel Albert Gallatin Jenkins, who until Virginia's secession from the Union, had represented the area in Congress. Jenkins was commissioned a brigadier general in 1862, but died of wounds received at the Battle of Cloyd's Mountain in May 1864. The second skirmish occurred on October 24, 1864, after West Virginia became a Union state. Confederate troops seized and sank a Union steamboat on the Kanawha River near Winfield, then attacked the courthouse, but the \"Battle of Winfield\" ended as a Union victory. Putnam County's Civil War soldiers were about evenly split between Union and Confederate, with about four hundred on each side.\nPutnam County was one of 50 Virginia counties admitted to the Union as the state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863. Later that year, its counties were divided into civil townships, with the intention of encouraging local government. This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872, the townships were converted into magisterial districts. Putnam County was initially divided into six townships: Buffalo, Curry, Grant, Hutton, Scott, and Union. These became magisterial districts in 1872, and the following year, two were renamed, with Grant becoming Teays Valley, while Hutton became Pocatalico. Except for minor adjustments, these districts were largely unchanged until the 1980s, when Buffalo and Union Districts were consolidated into Buffalo-Union District, and Teays Valley's name abbreviated to \"Teays\".\nA railroad was rebuilt through Putnam County in 1875.\nGeography.\nThe Kanawha River flows north-northwestward through the center of Putnam County. The county terrain consists of wooded hills, carved with drainages. The terrain slopes to the north, with the highest point near its southwest corner at above mean sea level.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 79,854. Its county seat is Cookeville. Putnam County is part of the Cookeville, TN Micropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nPutnam County is named in honor of Israel Putnam, who was a hero in the French and Indian War and a general in the American Revolutionary War. The county was initially established on February 2, 1842, when the Twenty-fourth Tennessee General Assembly enacted a measure creating the county from portions of Jackson, Overton, Fentress, and White counties.\nAfter the survey was completed by Mounce Gore, the Assembly instructed the commissioners to locate the county seat, to be called \"Monticello,\" near the center of the county. Contending, however, that the formation of Putnam was illegal because it reduced their areas below constitutional limits, Overton and Jackson counties secured an injunction against its continued operation. Putnam officials failed to reply to the complaint, and in the March 1845 term of the Chancery Court at Livingston, Chancellor Bromfield L. Ridley declared Putnam unconstitutionally established and therefore dissolved. The 1854 act reestablishing Putnam was passed after Representative Henderson M. Clements of Jackson County assured his colleagues that a new survey showed that there was sufficient area to form the county. White Plains, near modern Algood, acted as a temporary county seat.\nThe act specified the \"county town\" be named \"Cookeville\" in honor of Richard F. Cooke, who served in the Tennessee Senate from 1851 to 1854, representing at various times Jackson, Fentress, Macon, Overton and White Counties. The act authorized Joshua R. Stone and Green Baker from White County, William Davis and Isaiah Warton from Overton County, John Brown and Austin Morgan from Jackson County, William B. Stokes and Bird S. Rhea from DeKalb County, and Benjamin A. Vaden and Nathan Ward from Smith County, to study the Conner survey and select a spot, not more than two and one-half miles from the center of the county, for the courthouse. The first County Court chose a hilly tract of land, then owned by Charles Crook, for the site.\nPutnam County was the site of several saltpeter mines. Saltpeter is the main ingredient of gunpowder and was obtained by leaching the earth from several local caves. Calfkiller Saltpeter Cave, located in the Calfkiller Valley, was a major mining operation, as was Johnson Cave, also located in the Calfkiller Valley. Both caves still contain significant remnants of the mining activity. Several other caves in the county were the site of smaller operations. Most saltpeter mining in Middle Tennessee occurred during the War of 1812 and the Civil War.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.4%) is water.\nThe county is part of the greater Cumberland River watershed. The southern part of the county is drained by tributaries of the Caney Fork, the northeastern part by tributaries of the Obey River, and the north-central and northwestern parts of the county drain into the Cumberland's Cordell Hull Lake impoundment. The sources of two tributaries of the Caney Fork, the Falling Water River and the Calfkiller River, lie near Monterey in the eastern part of the county.\nIt is impossible to reach Cumberland Cove and Glade Creek without driving through another county.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 79,854 people, 31,778 households, and 19,395 families residing in the county.\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 72,321 people, 28,930 households, and 18,489 families residing in the county.

The largest college at Tennessee Tech is the College of Education. The university student population of 11,800 comprises one fourth of the resident population of Cookeville.\nThe Putnam County school system enrolls approximately 12,000 students in 18 schools throughout the county.

In 2008, John McCain won over 60% of the county's vote. In 2020, Republican Donald Trump easily swept Putnam with over 70% of the county vote, while Democrat Joe Biden racked up less than 28% of the vote. Even the University precinct itself voted for Republican presidential candidates in 2012, 2016, 2020 and 2024, although Phil Bredesen and Karl Dean did carry it handily in the 2018 federal Senate and gubernatorial elections. Despite this, Putnam was one of only four Tennessee counties Biden lost to Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary in 2020, indicating that the few Democrats left in Putnam County are unusually progressive.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 20,613. The county seat is at Ritzville, and its largest city is Othello. The county was formed out of Whitman County in November 1883 and is named after John Adams, the second President of the United States. Adams County's two most populous cities are Ritzville and Othello. Ritzville is located in the northeastern corner of the county at the junction of I-90 and US 395, making it a popular stop for travelers. Ritzville is an hour's drive from Spokane. Othello is located in the southwestern panhandle of the county.\nHistory.\nIncorporation.\nThe Governor of Washington Territory approved the proposed Adams County Articles of Incorporation on November 28, 1883. At that time Adams County and Franklin County were formed out of territory from Whitman County. The first County meeting (December 19, 1883) established Ritzville as the county seat.\nBy 1885, the county offices were established, in a wood-frame house purchased for the purpose in Ritzville.\nThe 1890 census showed that Adams County boasted 2,098 residents. The growing population justified a purpose-built courthouse, so construction began on a new brick courthouse on February 23, 1892.\n20th century.\nWheat farming was a main focus of early residents. By 1904, Ritzville had become the largest initial shipping point for wheat in the United States; a 1909 pamphlet at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle read:\"Adams County, Washington, the bread basket of the world. A land of wonderful resources where courage, intelligence, strenuous and persistent efforts of the hardy pioneer have wrested the hidden wealth from mother earth ... [a] golden wheat belt which has pushed its way steadily into the wilderness of sage brush which the pioneers found when they came. The gold has gradually absorbed the brown ... the history of Adams County is a song of wheat.\"\nIn May 1905, under pressure from citizens of the county, an addition to the courthouse was designed by Spokane architects Preusse &amp; Zittel, doubling its square footage, and moving the edge of the building to the sidewalk on West Broadway Ave.; the bell tower was dismantled. Spokane contractors Hastie &amp; Dougan supervised the project, which began in June and was completed in October for a cost of $12,247.\nWheat producers in Adams County used dryland farming in order to overcome the relative aridity of the county's climate. They let the wheatfields lie fallow in alternate years, holding sufficient moisture to raise profitable crops.\nThe county's population decreased significantly during the first half of the twentieth century, dropping by nearly five thousand from 1910 to 1940.\nIn 1940 the courthouse was replaced by a three-story building, with a two-story jail at the rear. Construction was completed in December 1940.\nIn 1943 the Federal government approved the Columbia Basin Project. It began impacting Adams County in 1946, when construction of the East Low Canal and the Potholes East Canal began. This work, and the ensuing increased agricultural production from irrigated crops, led to continual population increases. The population had increased by 12,500 from 1940 to 2010.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAdams County and Franklin County have the highest per capita percentage of Latino residents in the state.

Greene in 1885. In 1891 the commission bonded $20,000 in order to erect a permanent courthouse. The building was built by the Spokane firm of Burnham and Clapp and completed by August 20, 1891, when it was accepted by the county. It was a two-story brick building with a four-story tower and a stone basement. A two-story addition was added to the front in 1905 with a new four-story tower, giving the courthouse a whole new appearance. This building was replaced by the current art-deco courthouse in 1940.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nAmber Waves and Undertow -Peril, Hope, Sweat, and Downright Nonchalance in Dry Wheat Country- a book written by Steve Turner and published by the University of Oklahoma Press 2009 - "}

The first settlers began to arrive in the late 1860s, following the Homestead Act of 1862, which encouraged settlement by providing land to those who would develop and farm it. The initial settlement was somewhat slow due to Adams County's location in the Great Plains, often considered inhospitable because of its harsh climate and lack of timber. The establishment of the city of Hastings in 1872 by the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad, however, marked a significant turning point. The town of Juniata was initially the county seat, but after a contentious election in 1877, Hastings became the county seat due to its strategic location at the junction of two railroads.\nAdams county's growth thereafter was closely tied to the expansion of the railroad. The advent of railroad access to the county led to an influx of settlers, and by the mid-1870s, Adams County had seen substantial development in agriculture, particularly in the cultivation of wheat, corn, and other grains, as well as in the breeding of livestock.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 103,852. Its county seat is Gettysburg. The county was created on January 22, 1800, from part of York County, and was named for John Adams, the second President of the United States.\nBetween July 1 and July 3, 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg, the bloodiest and most significant battle of the American Civil War, was fought near Gettysburg. As a result, Adams County is a center for Civil War-related tourism. Adams County comprises the Gettysburg metropolitan statistical area, which is also included in the Harrisburg\u2013York\u2013Lebanon combined statistical area. The county is part of the South Central region of the commonwealth.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water. The Borough of Gettysburg is located at the center of Adams County. This county seat community is surrounded on three sides by the Gettysburg National Military Park (GNMP). The Eisenhower National Historic Site adjoins GNMP on its southwestern edge. Most of Adams County's rural landscapes and its mid-19th century roadway pattern remain intact today. Thirteen historic roadways converge at or near Gettysburg Borough. Two circular rings of towns surround Gettysburg; the first is typically found at a distance of approximately from Gettysburg. The second ring is found at a distance of 12 to from the county seat. This \"spokes and wheel\" pattern is one of the few examples of Central Place Theory in the Eastern United States.\nThe county is in the watershed of the Chesapeake Bay and is drained by the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers.\nClimate.\nAdams has a hot-summer humid continental climate (\"Dfa\").\nRecreation.\nRecreational areas of Adams County include \nGovernment.\nCommissioners.\nAdams County is administered by a three-person board of commissioners, who serve four-year terms. Elections occur in the odd-numbered years that precede U.S. presidential elections, with the most recent election falling in 2023.

In 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton only received 29.6% of the vote, the lowest share any Democrat had received in the county since George McGovern 44 years prior. No Democratic presidential candidate has won Adams County since Lyndon Johnson's 1964 landslide. However, Democratic strength exists in Gettysburg, which Biden carried 63%-35%.\nPennsylvania House of Representatives.\nAdams County consists of two Pennsylvania House Districts.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 20,654. Its county seat is Friendship. The county was created in 1848 and organized in 1853. Sources differ as to whether its name is in honor of the second President of the United States, John Adams, or his son, the sixth President, John Quincy Adams. The county is considered a high-recreation retirement destination by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nHistory.\nThe founders of Adams County were from upstate New York. These people were \"Yankee\" settlers, that is to say they were largely descended from the English Separatists who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal and the end of the Black Hawk War. They got to what is now Adams County by sailing up the Wisconsin River from the Mississippi River on small barges which they constructed themselves out of materials obtained from the surrounding woodlands. When they arrived in what is now Adams County, there was nothing but dense virgin forest, the \"Yankee\" New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings, and established post routes. They brought with them many of their Yankee New England values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Due to the second Great Awakening, some of them had converted to Methodism and some became Baptist before moving to what is now Adams County. Adams County, like much of Wisconsin, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its early history.\nIn the late 1880s, German immigrants began to settle in Adams County, making up less than one out of thirty settlers in the county before this date. Generally there was little conflict between them and the \"Yankee\" settlers, however when conflict did arise it focused around the issue of prohibition of alcohol. On this issue the Yankees were divided and the Germans almost unanimously were opposed to it, tipping the balance in favor of opposition to prohibition. Later the two communities would be divided on the issue of World War I in which, once again, the Yankee community would be divided and the Germans were unanimously opposed to American entry into the war. The Yankee community was generally pro-British, however many of the Yankees also did not want America to enter the war themselves. The Germans were sympathetic to Germany and did not want the United States to enter into a war against Germany, but the Germans were not anti-British. Prior to World War I, many German community leaders in Wisconsin spoke openly and enthusiastically about how much better America was than Germany, due primarily (in their eyes) to the presence of English law and the English political culture the Americans had inherited from the colonial era, which they contrasted with the turmoil and oppression in Germany which they had so recently fled.\nThe area covered by present-day Adams County was historically part of several other counties. In 1840, when Wisconsin was still a territory, Adams County was the southwestern section of Brown County. In 1836, Portage County was created and included most of present-day Columbia County, including the city of Portage, Wisconsin. In 1846, Portage County was renamed Columbia County. The area from the northern boundary of Columbia County to Lake Superior was removed from Brown County and was then called Portage County. In 1848, the southern part of Portage County was renamed Adams County and included all of current-day Adams County and the northern section of Juneau County. Adams County was organized in April 1853. In 1858, The northwestern part of Adams County was joined with the northern part of Sauk County to form present-day Juneau County. At this time, Adams County took its current shape.\nFriendship was founded by settlers coming from Friendship, New York. Today, Adams is the largest community in Adams County, but this was not always so. In the 1880s, there were plans for a railroad that connected Chicago and St. Paul to pass through Friendship. Once this was decided, local landowners increased their demands. Instead of paying more for the land in Friendship, the railroad placed the tracks south of Friendship. It was recorded that Emma Barnes, wife of \"Appletree\" Barnes, Friendship postmaster in the 1920s, wrote in 1957, \"I believe that the people of Friendship should express their appreciation of two of the early citizens... J. B. Hill and J. W. Purves... for holding the price of their land so high that the great C&amp;NW R.R. Co. would not purchase a right of way... for who would enjoy the smoke and the noise of a train running through this beautiful village?\"\nTo house workers, boxcars were stacked to form housing, and the town of Adams was created. What is now the city of Adams the railroad originally called Friendship, but because there were two rail depot stops named \"Friendship\" on the rail-line, passengers were often confused and bought the wrong tickets, so it was suggested that the name be changed. The new name was determined by the citizens who chose between Adams, for President John Adams, and Nottingham. This stretch of track became the famous \"400\" route. Today the population of Adams is about three times that of Friendship, WI.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (6.2%) is water.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the census of 2020, the population was 20,654.

They had a total population of 8,595 people in 58 congregations in 2017, or 24.2% of the county's population.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTransportation.\nThree U.S. Routes cross the county. U.S. Route 27 and U.S. Route 33 enter the north end of the county from Fort Wayne in neighboring Allen County. Passing through Decatur, they split; U.S. Route 27 goes south through Monroe, Berne and Geneva and continues into Jay County, whereas U.S. Route 33 heads southeast into Ohio. U.S. Route 224 passes from west to east through the north part of the county, intersecting U.S. Routes 27 and 33 in Decatur, then continuing into Ohio.\nIndiana State Road 124 runs east\u2013west through the county, from Bluffton in Wells County through Monroe and on to the Ohio border. Indiana State Road 101 runs south\u2013north, from State Road 124 near the Ohio border, through Pleasant Mills and Rivare, to Allen County. Indiana State Road 116 runs west\u2013east across the county, from Bluffton southeast to Linn Grove, south to Perryville, then east to a terminus at U.S. Route 27 in Geneva. Indiana State Road 218 runs west\u2013east across the southern end of the county, passing through Berne.\nCSX Transportation operates a rail line from Decatur, running northwest toward Fort Wayne.\nGovernment.\nThe county government is a constitutional body granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana and the Indiana Code. The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all spending and revenue collection. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms and are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes and service taxes. In 2010, the county budgeted approximately $2.2\u00a0million for the district's schools and $2.8\u00a0million for other county operations and services, for a total annual budget of approximately $5\u00a0million.\nA Board of Commissioners forms the county's executive body. They are elected county-wide, in staggered four\u2013year terms. One commissioner serves as board president. This board executes the acts of the council, causes necessary revenues to be collected, and manages day-to-day functions of the county government.\nThe county maintains a small claims court. This court's judge is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.\nThe county has other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor and circuit court clerk. Each of these serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and be residents of the county.\nEach township has a trustee who administers rural fire protection and ambulance service, provides poor relief, and manages cemetery care. The trustee is assisted by a three-member township board. The trustees and board members are elected to four-year terms.\nAdams County is part of Indiana's 3rd congressional district; Indiana Senate district 19; and Indiana House of Representatives district 79.\nPolitically, Adams County is heavily Republican. It has voted for the Republican presidential nominee in all but one election since 1940.\nEducation.\nPublic schools in Adams County are administered by three public entities: North Adams Community Schools; Adams Central Community Schools; and South Adams Schools. The Diocese of Fort Wayne and Lutheran Schools of Indiana both operate in Adams County as well. In all, these organizations operate 13 schools in the county.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 519,572. The county seat is Brighton, and the largest city is Thornton. The county is named for Alva Adams, an early Governor of the State of Colorado in 1887\u20131889. Adams County is part of the Denver metropolitan area.\nHistory.\nOn May 30, 1854, the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act created the Territory of Nebraska and Territory of Kansas, divided by the Parallel 40\u00b0 North (168th Avenue in present-day Adams County). The future Adams County, Colorado, occupied a strip of northern Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory, immediately south of the Nebraska Territory.\nIn 1859, John D. \"Colonel Jack\" Henderson built a ranch, trading post, and hotel on Henderson Island in the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory. Jack Henderson was the former editor and proprietor of the Leavenworth (Kansas Territory) Journal and an outspoken pro-slavery politician who had been accused of vote fraud in eastern Kansas. Henderson sold meat and provisions to gold seekers on their way up the South Platte River Trail to the gold fields during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Henderson Island was the first permanent settlement in the South Platte River Valley between Fort Saint Vrain in the Nebraska Territory and the Cherry Creek Diggings in the Kansas Territory. Jack Henderson eventually returned to eastern Kansas and fought for the Union in the American Civil War. Henderson Island is today the site of the Riverdale Regional Park, formerly known as the Adams County Regional Park and Fairgrounds.\nThe eastern portion of the Kansas Territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Kansas on January 29, 1861, and on February 28, 1861, the remaining western portion of the territory was made part of the new Colorado Territory. The Colorado Territory created Arapahoe County, on November 1, 1861, and Colorado was admitted to the Union on August 1, 1876.\nIn 1901, the Colorado General Assembly voted to split Arapahoe County into three parts: a new Adams County, a new consolidated City and County of Denver, and the remainder of the Arapahoe County to be renamed South Arapahoe County. A ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court, subsequent legislation, and a referendum delayed the creation of Adams County until November 15, 1902. Governor James Bradley Orman designated Brighton as the temporary Adams County Seat. Adams County originally stretched from present-day Sheridan Boulevard to the Kansas state border. On May 12, 1903, the eastern of Adams County was transferred to the new Washington County and the new Yuma County, reducing the length of Adams County to the present . On November 8, 1904, Adams County voters chose Brighton as the permanent county seat.\nA 1989 vote transferred of Adams County to the City and County of Denver for the proposed Denver International Airport, leaving the densely populated western portion of the county as two oddly-shaped peninsulas. Adams County lost the tip of its northwest corner when the consolidated City and County of Broomfield was created on November 15, 2001.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.4%) is water.\nAdams County surrounds (and surrendered the land for) most of Denver International Airport which are in the City and County of Denver.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 363,857 people, 128,156 households, and 92,144 families residing in the county.

The racial makeup of the county was 77.29% White, 2.97% Black or African American, 1.19% Native American, 3.21% Asian, 0.12% Pacific Islander, 11.73% from other races, and 3.49% from two or more races. 28.19% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nThere were 128,156 households, out of which 37.80% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.80% were married couples living together, 12.10% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.10% were non-families. 21.20% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.50% had someone who was 65 years of age or older living alone. The average household size was 2.81 and the average family size was 3.27.\nIn the county, the population was spread out, with 28.60% under the age of 18, 10.30% from 18 to 24, 34.00% from 25 to 44, 19.40% from 45 to 64, and 7.80% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.80 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.10 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $47,323, and the median income for a family was $52,517. Males had a median income of $36,499 versus $28,053 for females. The per capita income for the county was $19,944. About 6.50% of families and 8.90% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.90% of those under age 18 and 7.30% of those age 65 or over.\nIn 2000, the largest denominational groups were Catholics (with 60,429 members) and Evangelical Protestants (with 25,552 members). The largest religious bodies were the Catholic Church (with 60,429 adherents) and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (with 6,808 adherents).\nGovernment.\nAdams County has a Board of Commissioners that operate as a collective governing board. There are five members that form the Board of Commissioners with each elected to represent a district or portion of the county. There are other elected officials that oversee an aspect or department of county operations. \nAdams County lies within the 17th Judicial District which is represented by District Attorney Brian Mason.\nPolitics.\nAdams County is predominately Democratic, not having voted Republican since Ronald Reagan in 1984. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county without a majority, becoming the first Democrat to do so since her husband Bill Clinton in 1992. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden easily won the county with a majority of the vote, a percentage similar to Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008 but with a much larger vote count. \nDespite its Democratic majority, Adams County is significantly less Democrat than most other counties in the Denver metro area, frequently swinging towards the national trend. Despite Biden's overwhelming victory in 2020, the county swung hard back towards Trump in 2024, reducing the Democratic margin of victory from nearly 20% to under 10%. This came even as Colorado failed to swing as hard as most other states.\nEducation.\nThe school districts serving Adams County are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe county is also home to the Westminster campus of Front Range Community College, the largest community college by enrollment in Colorado.\nCommunities.\nCities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLicense plate code.\nUp until 1999 when Colorado ceased coding license plates by county, Adams County used the following codes on license plates issued to passenger vehicles: TE-UF, GA-GG, SAA-SEW, and SEY-TZZ.\nIn popular culture.\nAdams County was featured as the fictional rival of South Park's peewee hockey team in the \"South Park\" episode \"Stanley's Cup\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is designed to contain a flat object, such as a letter or card.\nTraditional envelopes are made from sheets of paper cut to one of three shapes: a rhombus, a short-arm cross or a kite. These shapes allow the envelope structure to be made by folding the sheet sides around a central rectangular area. In this manner, a rectangle-faced enclosure is formed with an arrangement of four flaps on the reverse side.\nOverview.\nA folding sequence such that the last flap closed is on a short side is referred to in commercial envelope manufacture as a pocket \u2013 a format frequently employed in the packaging of small quantities of seeds. Although in principle the flaps can be held in place by securing the topmost flap at a single point (for example with a wax seal), generally they are pasted or gummed together at the overlaps. They are most commonly used for enclosing and sending mail (letters) through a prepaid-postage postal system.\nWindow envelopes have a hole cut in the front side that allows the paper within to be seen. They are generally arranged so that the receiving address printed on the letter is visible, saving duplication of the address on the envelope itself. The window is normally covered with a transparent or translucent film to protect the letter inside, as was first designed by Americus F. Callahan in 1901 and patented the following year. In some cases, shortages of materials or the need to economize resulted in envelopes that had no film covering the window. One innovative process, invented in Europe about 1905, involved using hot oil to saturate the area of the envelope where the address would appear. The treated area became sufficiently translucent for the address to be readable. As of 2009[ [update]] there is no international standard for window envelopes, but some countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom, have national standards.\nAn aerogram is related to a letter sheet, both being designed to have writing on the inside to minimize the weight. Any handmade envelope is effectively a letter sheet because prior to the folding stage it offers the opportunity for writing a message on that area of the sheet that after folding becomes the inside of the face of the envelope. For document security, the letter sheet can be sealed with wax. Another secure form of letter sheet is a locked letter, that is formed by cutting and folding the sheet in an elaborate way that prevents the letter from being opened without creating obvious damage to the letter/envelope.\nThe \"envelope\" used to launch the Penny Post component of the British postal reforms of 1840 by Sir Rowland Hill and the invention of the postage stamp, was a lozenge-shaped lettersheet known as a Mulready. If desired, a separate letter could be enclosed with postage remaining at one penny provided the combined weight did not exceed half an ounce (14\u00a0grams). This was a legacy of the previous system of calculating postage, which partly depended on the number of sheets of paper used.\nDuring the U.S. Civil War those in the Confederate States Army occasionally used envelopes made from wallpaper, due to financial hardship.\nA \"return envelope\" is a pre-addressed, smaller envelope included as the contents of a larger envelope and can be used for courtesy reply mail, metered reply mail, or freepost (business reply mail). Some envelopes are designed to be reused as the return envelope, saving the expense of including a return envelope in the contents of the original envelope. The direct mail industry makes extensive use of return envelopes as a response mechanism.\nUp until 1840, all envelopes were handmade, each being individually cut to the appropriate shape out of an individual rectangular sheet. In that year George Wilson in the United Kingdom patented the method of tessellating (tiling) a number of envelope patterns across and down a large sheet, thereby reducing the overall amount of waste produced per envelope when they were cut out. In 1845 Edwin Hill and Warren de la Rue obtained a patent for a steam-driven machine that not only cut out the envelope shapes but creased and folded them as well. (Mechanised gumming had yet to be devised.) The convenience of the sheets ready cut to shape popularized the use of machine-made envelopes, and the economic significance of the factories that had produced handmade envelopes gradually diminished.\nAs envelopes are made of paper, they are intrinsically amenable to embellishment with additional graphics and text over and above the necessary postal markings. This is a feature that the direct mail industry has long taken advantage of\u2014and more recently the Mail Art movement. Custom printed envelopes has also become an increasingly popular marketing method for small business.\nMost of the over 400 billion envelopes of all sizes made worldwide are machine-made.\nSizes.\nInternational standard sizes.\nInternational standard ISO 269 (withdrawn in 2009 without replacement) defined several standard envelope sizes, which are designed for use with ISO 216 standard paper sizes:\nThe German standard DIN 678 defines a similar list of envelope formats.\nDL comes from the DIN Lang (German: \"Long\") size envelope which originated in the 1920s.\nNorth American sizes.\nThere are dozens of sizes of envelopes available in the United States.\nThe designations such as \"A2\" do not correspond to ISO paper sizes. Sometimes, North American paper jobbers and printers will insert a hyphen to distinguish from ISO sizes, thus: A-2.\nThe No. 10 envelope is the standard business envelope size in the United States.\nPWG 5101.1 also lists the following even inch sizes for envelopes: , , , , , and .\nEnvelopes accepted by the U.S. Postal Service for mailing at the price of a letter must be:\nJapanese sizes.\nJapanese traditional rectangular (\u89d2\u5f62, \"kakugata\", K) and long (\u9577\u5f62, \"nagagata\", N) envelopes open on the short side, while Western-style (\u6d0b\u5f62, \"y\u014dgata\", Y) envelopes open on the long side.\nThe Japanese standard JIS S 5502 was first published in 1964. Some traditional sizes were not kept and some sizes have been removed until its latest edition in 2014, leaving behind gaps in the numeric sequence of designations.\nManufacture.\nHistory of envelopes.\nThe first known envelope was nothing like the paper envelope of today. It can be dated back to around 3500 to 3200\u00a0BC in the ancient Middle East. Hollow clay spheres were molded around financial tokens and used in private transactions. The two people who discovered these first envelopes were Jacques de Morgan, in 1901, and Roland de Mecquenem, in 1907.\nPaper envelopes were developed in China, where paper was invented by the 2nd century BC. Paper envelopes, known as \"chih poh\", were used to store gifts of money. In the Southern Song dynasty, the Chinese imperial court used paper envelopes to distribute monetary gifts to government officials.\nIn Western history, from the time flexible writing material became more readily available in the 13th century until the mid-19th century, correspondence was typically secured by a process of folding and sealing the letter itself, sometimes including elaborate letterlocking techniques to indicate tampering or prove authenticity. Some of these letter techniques, which could involve stitching or wax seals, were also employed to secure hand-made envelopes.\nPrior to 1840, all envelopes were handmade, including those for commercial use. In 1840 George Wilson of London was granted a patent for an envelope-cutting machine (patent: \"an improved paper-cutting machine\"); these machine-cut envelopes still needed to be folded by hand. There is a picture of the front and backside of an envelope stamped in 1841 here on this page. It seems to be machine cut. In 1845, Edwin Hill and Warren De La Rue were granted a British patent for the first envelope-folding machine.\nThe \"envelopes\" produced by the Hill/De La Rue machine were not like those used today. They were flat diamond, lozenge (or rhombus)-shaped sheets or \"blanks\" that had been precut to shape before being fed to the machine for creasing and made ready for folding to form a rectangular enclosure. The edges of the overlapping flaps treated with a paste or adhesive and the method of securing the envelope or wrapper was a user choice. The symmetrical flap arrangement meant that it could be held together with a single wax seal at the apex of the topmost flap. (That the flaps of an envelope can be held together by applying a seal at a single point is a classic design feature of an envelope.)\nNearly 50 years passed before a commercially successful machine for producing pre-gummed envelopes, like those in use today, appeared.\nThe origin of the use of the diamond shape for envelopes is debated. However, as an alternative to simply wrapping a sheet of paper around a folded letter or an invitation and sealing the edges, it is a tidy and ostensibly paper-efficient way of producing a rectangular-faced envelope. Where the claim to be paper-efficient fails is a consequence of paper manufacturers normally making paper available in rectangular sheets, because the largest size of envelope that can be realised by cutting out a diamond or any other shape which yields an envelope with symmetrical flaps is smaller than the largest that can be made from that sheet simply by folding.\nThe folded diamond-shaped sheet (or \"blank\") was in use at the beginning of the 19th century as a novelty wrapper for invitations and letters among the proportion of the population that had the time to sit and cut them out and were affluent enough not to bother about the waste offcuts. Their use first became widespread in the UK when the British government took monopoly control of postal services and tasked Rowland Hill with its introduction. The new service was launched in May 1840 with a postage-paid machine-printed illustrated (or pictorial) version of the wrapper and the much-celebrated first adhesive postage stamp, the Penny Black, for the production of which the Jacob Perkins printing process was used to deter counterfeiting and forgery. The wrappers were printed and sold as a sheet of 12, with cutting the purchaser's task. Known as Mulready stationery, because the illustration was created by the respected artist William Mulready, the envelopes were withdrawn when the illustration was ridiculed and lampooned. Nevertheless, the public apparently saw the convenience of the wrappers being available ready-shaped, and it must have been obvious that with the stamp available totally plain versions of the wrapper could be produced and postage prepaid by purchasing a stamp and affixing it to the wrapper once folded and secured. In this way although the postage-prepaid printed pictorial version died ignominiously, the diamond-shaped wrapper acquired de facto official status and became readily available to the public notwithstanding the time taken to cut them out and the waste generated. With the issuing of the stamps and the operation and control of the service (which is a communications medium) in government hands the British model spread around the world and the diamond-shaped wrapper went with it.\nHill also installed his brother Edwin as The Controller of Stamps, and it was he with his partner Warren De La Rue who patented the machine for mass-producing the diamond-shaped sheets for conversion to envelopes in 1845. Today, envelope-making machine manufacture is a long- and well-established international industry, and blanks are produced with a short-arm-cross shape and a kite shape as well as diamond shape. (The short-arm-cross style is mostly encountered in \"pocket\" envelopes i.e. envelopes with the closing flap on a short side. The more common style, with the closing flap on a long side, are sometimes referred to as \"standard\" or \"wallet\" style for purposes of differentiation.)\nThe most famous paper-making machine was the Fourdrinier machine. The process involves taking processed pulp stock and converting it to a continuous web which is gathered as a reel. Subsequently, the reel is guillotined edge to edge to create a large number of properly rectangular sheets because ever since the invention of Gutenberg's press paper has been closely associated with printing.\nTo this day, all other mechanical printing and duplicating equipments devised in the meantime, including the typewriter (which was used up to the 1990s for addressing envelopes), have been primarily designed to process rectangular sheets. Hence the large sheets are in turn guillotined down to the sizes of rectangular sheet commonly used in the commercial printing industry, and nowadays to the sizes commonly used as feed-stock in office-grade computer printers, copiers and duplicators (mainly ISO, A4 and US Letter).\nUsing any mechanical printing equipment to print on envelopes, which although rectangular, are in fact folded sheets with differing thicknesses across their surfaces, calls for skill and attention on the part of the operator. In commercial printing the task of printing on machine-made envelopes is referred to as \"overprinting\" and is usually confined to the front of the envelope. If printing is required on all four flaps as well as the front, the process is referred to as \"printing on the flat\". Eye-catching illustrated envelopes or pictorial envelopes, the origins of which as an artistic genre can be attributed to the Mulready stationery \u2013 and which was printed in this way \u2013 are used extensively for direct mail. In this respect, direct mail envelopes have a shared history with propaganda envelopes (or \"covers\") as they are called by philatelists.\nPresent and future state of envelopes.\nIn 1998, the U.S. Postal Service became the first postal authority to approve a system of printing digital stamps. With this innovative alternative to an adhesive-backed postage stamp, businesses could more easily produce envelopes in-house, address them, and customize them with advertising information on the face.\nThe fortunes of the commercial envelope manufacturing industry and the postal service go hand in hand, and both link to the printing industry and the mechanized envelope processing industry producing equipment such as franking and addressing machines. Technological developments affecting one ricochet through the others: addressing machines print addresses, postage stamps are a print product, franking machines imprint a frank on an envelope. If fewer envelopes are required; fewer stamps are required; fewer franking machines are required and fewer addressing machines are required. For example, the advent of information-based indicia (IBI) (commonly referred to as digitally-encoded electronic stamps or digital indicia) by the US Postal Service in 1998 caused widespread consternation in the franking machine industry, as their machines were rendered obsolete, and resulted in a flurry of lawsuits involving Pitney Bowes among others. The advent of e-mail in the late 1990s appeared to offer a substantial threat to the postal service. By 2008 letter-post service operators were reporting significantly smaller volumes of letter-post, specifically stamped envelopes, which they attributed mainly to e-mail. Although a corresponding reduction in the volume of envelopes required would have been expected, no such decrease was reported as widely as the reduction in letter-post volumes.\nTypes of envelopes.\nWindowed envelopes.\nA windowed envelope is an envelope with a plastic or glassine window in it. The plastic in these envelopes creates problems in paper recycling.\nSecurity envelopes.\nSecurity envelopes have special tamper-resistant and tamper-evident features. They are used for high value products and documents as well as for evidence for legal proceedings.\nSome security envelopes have a patterned tint printed on the inside, which makes it difficult to read the contents. Various patterns exist.\nMailers.\nSome envelopes are available for full-size documents or for other items. Some carriers have large mailing envelopes for their express services. Other similar envelopes are available at stationery supply locations.\nThese mailers usually have an opening on an end with a flap that can be attached by gummed adhesive, integral pressure-sensitive adhesive, adhesive tape, or security tape.\nConstruction is usually:\nPadded mailers.\nShipping envelopes can have padding to provide stiffness and some degree of cushioning. The padding can be ground newsprint, plastic foam sheets, or bubble packing.\nInter-office envelopes.\nVarious U.S. Federal Government offices use Standard Form (SF) 65 Government Messenger Envelopes for inter-office mail delivery. These envelopes are typically light brown in color and un-sealed with string-tied closure method and an array of holes throughout both sides such that it is somewhat visible what the envelope contains. Other colloquial names for this envelope include \"Holey Joe\" and \"Shotgun\" envelope due to the holey nature of the envelope. Address method is unique in that these envelopes are re-usable and the previous address is crossed out thoroughly and the new addressee (name, building, room, and mailstop) is written in the next available box. Although still in use, SF-65 is no longer listed on the United States Office of Personnel Management website list of standard forms.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is used by governments and business in Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America. It has largely replaced the older Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, except in some government agencies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nAn establishment is typically a single physical location, though administratively distinct operations at a single location may be treated as separate establishments. Each establishment is classified as an industry according to the primary business activity taking place there. NAICS does not offer guidance on organizing enterprises (companies) composed of multiple establishments.\nCodes.\nThe NAICS numbering system employs a five or six-digit code at the most detailed industry level. The first five digits are generally (although not always strictly) the same in all three countries. The first two digits designate the largest business sector; the third digit represents the subsector; the fourth digit represents the industry group; the fifth digit designates the NAICS industries, and the sixth digit represents the national industries.\nHistory.\nNAICS is a collaborative effort by Mexico's (INEGI), Statistics Canada, NATIONAL A and the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB), through its Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), staffed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the Census Bureau. The system is designed to be largely compatible with the United Nations Statistical Office's International Standard Industrial Classification system (ISIC). NAICS versions are released every five years.\nWith the first version, released in 1997, NAICS offered enhanced service sector coverage relative to the SIC. The 2002 revision accommodated significant changes in the Information Sector. The 2012 revision slightly reduced the number of industries and modified six sectors. NAICS changes are done at intervals of five years; the latest NAICS updated in 2022.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
