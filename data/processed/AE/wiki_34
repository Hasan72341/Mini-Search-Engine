It is a group of closely related Egyptian dialects, representing the most recent developments of the Egyptian language, and historically spoken by the Copts, starting from the third century AD in Roman Egypt. Coptic was supplanted by Arabic as the primary spoken language of Egypt following the Arab conquest of Egypt and was slowly replaced over the centuries.\nCoptic has no modern-day native speakers, and no fluent speakers apart from a number of priests, although it remains in daily use as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church and of the Coptic Catholic Church. It is written with the Coptic alphabet, a modified form of the Greek alphabet with seven additional letters borrowed from the Demotic Egyptian script.\nThe major Coptic dialects are Sahidic, Bohairic, Akhmimic, Fayyumic, Lycopolitan (Asyutic), and Oxyrhynchite. Sahidic Coptic was spoken between the cities of Asyut and Oxyrhynchus and flourished as a literary language across Egypt in the period c.\u2009325\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009800 AD. The Gnostic texts in the Nag Hammadi library are primarily written in the Sahidic dialect. However, some texts also contain elements of the Subakhmimic (Lycopolitan) dialect, which was also used in Upper Egypt. Bohairic, the dialect of Lower Egypt, gained prominence in the 9th century and is the dialect used by the Coptic Church liturgically.\nName.\nIn Coptic the language is called \u03ef\u2c99\u2c89\u2ca7\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u2c9b\u0300\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93 () \"Egyptian\" or \u03ef\u2c81\u2ca5\u2ca1\u2c93 \u2c9b\u0300\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u2c9b\u0300\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93 () \"the Egyptian language\". Coptic also possessed the term () \"Egyptian\", derived from Greek (). This was borrowed into Arabic as (), and from there into the languages of Europe, giving rise to words like French , whence the English \"Copt\".\nGeographic distribution.\nCoptic is spoken liturgically in the Coptic Orthodox and Coptic Catholic Church (along with Modern Standard Arabic). The language is spoken only in Egypt and historically has had little influence outside of the territory, except for monasteries located in Nubia (which straddles modern Egypt and Sudan). Coptic's most noticeable linguistic influence has been on the various dialects of Egyptian Arabic, which is characterised by a Coptic substratum in lexical, morphological, syntactical, and phonological features.\nInfluence on other languages.\nIn addition to influencing the grammar, vocabulary and syntax of Egyptian Arabic, Coptic has lent to both Arabic and Modern Hebrew such words as:\nA few words of Coptic origin are found in the Greek language; some of the words were later lent to various European languages\u2009\u2014\u2009such as \"barge\", from Coptic (\u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89, \"small boat\").\nHowever, most words of Egyptian origin that entered into Greek and subsequently into other European languages came directly from Ancient Egyptian, often Demotic. An example is the Greek (), which comes directly from Egyptian or Demotic . However, Coptic reborrowed some words of Ancient Egyptian origin into its lexicon, via Greek.\nMany place names in modern Egypt are Arabic adaptations of their former Coptic names:\nThe Coptic name \u2ca1\u2c81\u2ca1\u2c9b\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2ca7\u2c89, (from Egyptian ), means \"belonging to God\" or \"he of God\". It was adapted into Arabic as , which remains a common name among Egyptian Copts to this day. It was also borrowed into Greek as the name (). That, in turn, is the source of the Russian name (), perhaps best known in the name of the mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev.\nHistory.\nThe Egyptian language may have the longest documented history of any language, from Old Egyptian, which appeared just before 3200 BC, to its final phases as Coptic in the Middle Ages. Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the New Kingdom of Egypt. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and indefinite articles and periphrastic verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after Demotic and the new writing system that was adapted from the Greek alphabet.\nPre-Islamic period.\nThe earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Scholars frequently refer to this phase as Pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the Late Period of ancient Egypt, demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between Egyptians and Greeks even before Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt.\nAfter Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt and the subsequent Greek administration of the Ptolemaic Kingdom led to the widespread hellenization and Greek-Coptic bilingualism more so in Northern Egypt and especially in the Nile Delta. This led to the entrance of many Greek loanwords into Coptic, particularly in words relating to technical, legal, commercial, and technological topics.\nCoptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of ancient Egyptian religion, who, unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria. Old Coptic is represented mostly by non-Christian texts such as Egyptian pagan prayers and magical and astrological papyri. Many of them served as glosses to original hieratic and demotic equivalents. The glosses may have been aimed at non-Egyptian speakers.\nUnder late Roman rule, Diocletian persecuted many Egyptian converts to the new Christian religion, which forced new converts to flee to the Egyptian deserts. In time, the growth of these communities generated the need to write Christian Greek instructions in the Egyptian language. The early Fathers of the Coptic Church, such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great, Macarius of Egypt and Athanasius of Alexandria, who otherwise usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Egyptian. The Egyptian language, now written in the Coptic alphabet, flourished in the second and third centuries. \nThe Coptic language evolved in Egypt around 300 C.E. and was Egypt's lingua franca when Egypt was primarily Christian. It is a common assumption that the Coptic language was developed cheifly to proselytize Christianity, but Leo Depuydt disagrees. Depuydt supports Belgian Coptologist Louis Th\u00e9ophile Lefort\u2019s theory that the Coptic language was created by the Jews.\nIt was not until Shenoute that Coptic became a fully standardised literary language based on the Sahidic dialect. Shenoute's native Egyptian tongue and knowledge of Greek and rhetoric gave him the necessary tools to elevate Coptic, in content and style, to a literary height nearly equal to the position of the Egyptian language in ancient Egypt.\nIslamic period.\nThe Muslim conquest of Egypt by Arabs came with the spread of Islam in the seventh century. At the turn of the eighth century, Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan decreed that Arabic replace Koine Greek as the sole administrative language. Literary Coptic gradually declined, and within a few hundred years, Egyptian bishop Severus ibn al-Muqaffa found it necessary to write his \"History of the Patriarchs\" in Arabic. However, ecclesiastically the language retained an important position, and many hagiographic texts were also composed during this period. Until the 10th century, Coptic remained the spoken language of the native population outside the capital.\nThe Coptic language massively declined under the hands of Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, as part of his campaigns of religious persecution. Emile Maher Ishaq, a noted Coptologist, writes in the Coptic Encyclopedia that Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah issued strict orders completely prohibiting the use of Coptic anywhere whether in schools, public streets, and even within family homes. Those who did not comply were liable to have their tongues removed. Oral traditions of the Coptic Church tell of removed tongues left on the street or in a public square to intimidate and warn against speaking Coptic.\nAs a written language, Coptic is thought to have completely given way to Arabic around the 13th century, though it seems to have survived as a spoken language until the 17th century and in some localities even longer. The language may have survived in isolated pockets in Upper Egypt as late as the 19th century. In the village of Pi-Solsel (Az-Zayniyyah, El Zenya or Al Zeniya north of Luxor), passive speakers over 50 years old were recorded as late as the 1930s, and traces of traditional vernacular Coptic were reported to exist in other places such as Abydos and Dendera.\nFrom the medieval period, there is one known example of \"tarsh\"-printed Coptic. The fragmentary amulet A.Ch. 12.145, now in the Austrian National Library, contains a frame of Coptic text around an Arabic main text.\nModern revitalisation attempts.\nIn the early 20th century, some Copts tried to revive the Coptic language, but they were unsuccessful.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria started a national Church-sponsored movement to revive Coptic. Several works of grammar were published, including a more comprehensive dictionary than had been formerly available. The scholarly findings of the field of Egyptology and the inauguration of the Institute of Coptic Studies further contributed to the renaissance. Efforts at language revitalisation continue to be undertaken, and have attracted the interest of Copts and linguists in and outside of Egypt.\nWriting system.\nCoptic uses a writing system almost wholly derived from the Greek alphabet, with the addition of a number of letters that have their origins in Demotic Egyptian. This is comparable to the Latin-based Icelandic alphabet, which includes the runic letter thorn. There is some variation in the number and forms of these signs depending on the dialect. Some of the letters in the Coptic alphabet that are of Greek origin were normally reserved for Greek words. Old Coptic texts used several graphemes that were not retained in the literary Coptic orthography of later centuries.\nIn Sahidic, syllable boundaries may have been marked by a supralinear stroke \u27e8\u25cc\u0304\u27e9, or the stroke may have tied letters together in one word, since Coptic texts did not otherwise indicate word divisions. Some scribal traditions use a diaeresis over the letters \u2c93 and \u2ca9 at the beginning of a word or to mark a diphthong. Bohairic uses a superposed point or small stroke known as \u03eb\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c95\u2c93\u2c99 (, \"movement\"). When \"jinkim\" is placed over a vowel it is pronounced independently, and when it is placed over a consonant a short \u2c89 precedes it.\nLiterature.\nThe oldest Coptic writings date to the pre-Christian era (Old Coptic), though Coptic literature consists mostly of texts written by prominent saints of the Coptic Church such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great, and Shenoute. Shenoute helped fully standardise the Coptic language through his many sermons, treatises and homilies, which formed the basis of early Coptic literature.\nVocabulary.\nThe core lexicon of Coptic is Egyptian, most closely related to the preceding Demotic phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from Greek, but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have semantic differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely because the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language. There Greek loan words occur everywhere in Coptic literature, be it Biblical, liturgical, theological, or non-literary, i.e. legal documents and personal letters. Though nouns and verbs predominate, the Greek loan words may come from any other part of speech except pronouns'\nThe Greek loanwords in Coptic retain their original male or female gender, but Greek neuter nouns are treated as masculine in Coptic. The Greek nouns are usually inflected in the singular and in the nominative case though occasionally.\nWords or concepts for which no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering the meaning of the religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not used as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts use many such words, phrases and epithets; for example, the word \u2ca7\u2c83\u2c81\u2c93\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2ca9 '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of Anubis. There are also traces of some archaic grammatical features, such as residues of the Demotic relative clause, lack of an indefinite article and possessive use of suffixes.\nThus, the transition from the old traditions to the new Christian religion also contributed to the adoption of Greek words into the Coptic religious lexicon. It is safe to assume that the everyday speech of the native population retained, to a greater extent, its indigenous Egyptian character, which is sometimes reflected in Coptic nonecclesiastical documents such as letters and contracts.\nPhonology.\nCoptic provides the clearest indication of Later Egyptian phonology from its writing system, which fully indicates vowel sounds and occasionally stress patterns. The phonological system of Later Egyptian is also better known than that of the Classical phase of the language because of a greater number of sources indicating Egyptian sounds, including cuneiform letters containing transcriptions of Egyptian words and phrases, and Egyptian renderings of Northwest Semitic names. Coptic sounds, in addition, are known from a variety of Coptic-Arabic papyri in which Arabic letters were used to transcribe Coptic and vice versa. They date to the medieval Islamic period, when Coptic was still spoken.\nVowels.\nThere are some differences of opinion among Coptic language scholars on the correct phonetic interpretation of the writing system of Coptic. Differences centre on how to interpret the pairs of letters \u2c89/\u2c8f and \u2c9f/\u2cb1. In the Attic dialect of Ancient Greek in the 5th century BC, the first member of each pair is a short closed vowel , and the second member is a long open vowel . In some interpretations of Coptic phonology, it is assumed that the length difference is primary, with \u2c89/\u2c8f and \u2c9f/\u2cb1 is . Other scholars argue for a different analysis in which \u2c89/\u2c8f and \u2c9f/\u2cb1 are interpreted as and .\nThese two charts show the two theories of Coptic vowel phonology:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDialects vary in their realisation. The difference between and seems to be allophonic. Evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that these are distinct vowels, and if they are, the difference has a very low functional load. For dialects that use orthographic \u27e8\u27e9 for a single vowel, there appears to be no phonetic difference from \u27e8\u27e9.\nDouble orthographic vowels are presumed here to be long, but there is considerable debate as to whether these double vowels represent long vowels or glottal stops.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is no length distinction in final stressed position, but only those vowels that occur long appear there: \u27e8\u27e9.\nIn Sahidic, the letter \u2c89 was used for short before back fricatives, and also for unstressed schwa . It's possible there was also a distinction between short and , but if so the functional load was extremely low.\nBohairic did not have long vowels. was only written \u27e8\u27e9. As above, it's possible that and were distinct vowels rather than just allophones.\nIn Late Coptic (that is, Late Bohairic), the vowels were reduced to those found in Egyptian Arabic, . \u27e8\u27e9 became , \u27e8\u27e9 became , and \u27e8\u27e9 became either or . It is difficult to explain \u27e8\u27e9. However, it generally became in stressed monosyllables, in unstressed monosyllables, and in polysyllables, when followed by , and when not.\nThere were no doubled orthographic vowels in Mesokemic. Some representative correspondences with Sahidic are:\nIt is not clear if these correspondences reflect distinct pronunciations in Mesokemic, or if they are an imitation of the long Greek vowels \u27e8\u03b7, \u03c9\u27e9.\nConsonants.\nAs with the vowels, there are differences of opinion over the correct interpretation of the Coptic consonant letters, particularly with regard to the letters \u03eb and \u03ed. \u03eb is transcribed as \u27e8j\u27e9 in many older Coptic sources and \u03ed as \u27e8\u0261\u27e9 or \u27e8\u010d\u27e9. notes that the current conventional pronunciations are different from the probable ancient pronunciations: Sahidic \u03eb was probably pronounced and \u03ed was probably pronounced . suggests that \u03eb was pronounced .\nBeside being found in Greek loanwords, the letters \u27e8\u03c6, \u03b8, \u03c7\u27e9 were used in native words for a sequence of plus , as in \u2c91\u2c89 = \u2ca7-\u03e9\u2c89 \"the-way\" (f.sg.) and \u2cab\u2c9f\u03e5 = \u2ca1-\u03e9\u2c9f\u03e5 \"the-snake\" (m.sg). The letters did not have this use in Bohairic, which used them for single sounds.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt is possible that Coptic has a glottal stop, , though there is no definitive evidence. Supporters of this theory have posited that the glottal stop was represented with \u2c81 word-initially, with \u2c93 word-finally in monosyllabic words in northern dialects, and \u2c89 in monosyllabic words in Akhmimic and Assiutic. In Sahidic, it has been postulated that it represented the second of a doubled vowel.\nIn Late Coptic (ca. 14th century), Bohairic sounds that did not occur in Egyptian Arabic were lost. A possible shift from a tenuis-aspirate distinction to voiced-tenuis is only attested from the alveolars, the only place that Arabic has such a contrast.\nEarlier phases of Egyptian may have contrasted voiceless and voiced bilabial plosives, but the distinction seems to have been lost. Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic all interchangeably use their respective graphemes to indicate either sound; for example, Coptic for 'iron' appears alternately as \u2ca1\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89, \u2c83\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89 and \u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c93\u2c83\u2c89. That probably reflects dialect variation. Both letters were interchanged with \u2cab and \u03e5 to indicate , and \u2c83 was also used in many texts to indicate the bilabial approximant . Coptologists believe that Coptic \u2c83 was articulated as a voiced bilabial fricative . In the present-day Coptic Church services, this letter is realised as , but it is almost certainly a result of the pronunciation reforms instituted in the 19th century.\nWhereas Old Egyptian contrasts and , the two sounds appear to be in free variation in Coptic, as they were since the Middle Egyptian period. However, they are contrasted only in Greek loans; for example, native Coptic \u2c81\u2c9b\u2c8d\u2c8f\u2c83 (\"anz\u0113b\") and \u2c81\u2c9b\u2ca5\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89 (\"ans\u0113b\u0259\") 'school' are homophonous. Other consonants that sometimes appear to be either in free variation or to have different distributions across dialects are and , and (especially in the Fayyumic dialect, a feature of earlier Egyptian) and and , with the voiceless stop consonants being more common in Coptic words and the voiced ones in Greek borrowings. Apart from the liquid consonants, this pattern may indicate a sound change in Later Egyptian, leading to a neutralisation of voiced alveolar and velar plosives. When the voiced plosives are realised, it is usually the result of consonant voicing in proximity to .\nA few early manuscripts have a letter \u2ccb or \u2cc3 \"\u00e7\" where Sahidic and Bohairic have \u03e3 \"\u0161\". and Akhmimic has \u2cc9 \"x\". This sound seems to have been lost early on.\nGrammar.\nCoptic is primarily a fusional (inflectional) language, though some scholars, such as , have suggested it has agglutinative or even polysynthetic tendencies. Its morphology relies heavily on prefixation and clitics, but these forms frequently encode multiple grammatical functions. Its standard word order is subject\u2013verb\u2013object, though it can shift to verb\u2013subject\u2013object with the appropriate preposition before the subject. Number, gender, tense, and mood are marked by prefixes and clitics, which evolved from Late Egyptian. While earlier stages of Egyptian used suffixation for verb conjugation, Coptic largely replaced these with periphrastic constructions and prefix-based inflection, though vestiges of suffix inflection survive in certain verbs and possessive structures. For example, the Middle Egyptian form \"*sat\u0101pafa\" ('he chooses', written \"stp.f\" in hieroglyphs) corresponds to the Coptic (Sahidic) \"f.sotp\" (\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2ca7\u2ca1\u0305, 'he chooses'), where the prefix \"f-\" encodes multiple grammatical functions simultaneously, characteristic of fusional morphology rather than agglutination.\nNouns.\nAll Coptic nouns carry grammatical gender, either masculine or feminine, usually marked through a definite article as in the Romance languages, though Coptic articles are prefixes rather than separate words. Masculine nouns are marked with the article and feminine nouns with the article in the Sahidic dialect and and in the Bohairic dialect.\n Bohairic: \u2ca1\u2c93\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93 \u2013 'the man' / \u03ef\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb \u2013 'the hand'\n Sahidic: \u2ca1\u2c89\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89 \u2013 'the man' / \u2ca7\u2c89\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb \u2013 'the hand'\nThe definite and indefinite articles also indicate number; however, only definite articles mark gender. Coptic has a number of broken plurals, a vestige of Older Egyptian, but in the majority of cases, the article marks number. Generally, nouns inflected for plurality end in , but there are some irregularities. The dual was another feature of earlier Egyptian that survives in Coptic in only few words, such as \u2ca5\u2c9b\u2c81\u2ca9 (\"snau\") 'two'.\nWords of Greek origin keep their original grammatical gender, except for neuter nouns, which become masculine in Coptic.\nPossession of definite nouns is expressed with a series of possessive articles which are prefixed to the noun. These articles agree with the person, number, and gender of the possessor and the number and gender of the possessed noun. The forms of the possessive article vary according to dialect.\nPronouns.\nCoptic pronouns are of two kinds, dependent and independent. Independent pronouns are used when the pronoun is acting as the subject of a sentence, as the object of a verb, or with a preposition. Dependent pronouns are a series of prefixes and suffixes that can attach to verbs and other nouns. Coptic verbs can therefore be said to inflect for the person, number and gender of the subject and the object: a pronominal prefix marks the subject, and a pronominal suffix marks the object, e.g. \"I I'have'it the ball.\" When (as in this case) the subject is a pronoun, it normally is not also expressed independently, unless for emphasis.\nAs in other Afroasiatic languages, gender of pronouns differ only in the second and third person singular.\nAdjectives.\nMost Coptic adjectives are actually nouns that have the attributive particle \"n\" to make them adjectival. In all stages of Egyptian, this morpheme is also used to express the genitive; for example, the Bohairic word for 'Egyptian', \u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u2c9b\u0300\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93 , is a combination of the nominal prefix \u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99- \"rem-\" (the reduced form of \u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93 \"r\u014dmi\" 'man'), followed by the genitive morpheme \u2c9b\u0300 \"\u0259n\" ('of') and finally the word for Egypt, \u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93 \"k\u02b0\u0113mi\".\nVerbs.\nVerbal grade system.\nCoptic, like Ancient Egyptian and Semitic languages, has root-and-pattern or templatic morphology, and the basic meaning of a verb is contained in a root and various derived forms of root are obtained by varying the vowel pattern. For example, the root for 'build' is \"kt\". It has four derived forms:\nThe absolute, nominal, and pronominal state grades are used in different syntactic contexts. The absolute state grade of a transitive verb is used before a direct object with the accusative preposition , and the nominal state grade is used before a direct object with no case-marking. The pronominal state grade is used before a pronominal direct object enclitic. In addition, many verbs also have a neutral state grade, used to express a state resulting from the action of the verb. Compare the following forms:\n&lt;section begin=\"list-of-glossing-abbreviations\" /&gt;\nABS:absolute state grade\nNOM:nominal state grade\nPRONOM:pronominal state grade\n&lt;section end=\"list-of-glossing-abbreviations\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor most transitive verbs, both absolute and nominal state grade verbs are available for non-pronominal objects. However, there is one important restriction, known as \"Jernstedt's rule\" (or the \"Stern-Jernstedt rule\") : present-tense sentences cannot be used in the nominal state grade. Thus sentences in the present tense always show a pattern like the first example above (absolute state), never the second pattern (nominal state).\nIn general, the four grades of Coptic verb are not predictable from the root, and are listed in the lexicon for each verb. The following chart shows some typical patterns of correspondence:\nIt is hazardous to make firm generalisations about the relationships between these grade forms, but the nominal state is usually shorter than the corresponding absolute and neutral forms. Absolute and neutral state forms are usually bisyllabic or contain a long vowel; the corresponding nominal state forms are monosyllabic or have short vowels.\nTense/aspect/mood inflection.\nCoptic has a very large number of distinct tense-aspect-mood categories, expressed by particles which are either before the verb or before the subject. The future is a preverbal particle and follows the subject:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn contrast, the perfective is a pre-subject particle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is some variation in the labels for the tense/aspect/mood categories. The chart below shows the labels from , , . (Where they agree, only one label is shown.) Each form lists the morphology found with a nonpronominal subject (Marked with an underscore in Coptic) and a third person singular masculine pronominal subject ('he'):\nAn approximate range of use for most of the tense/aspect/mood categories is shown in the following table:\nSecond tenses.\nAn unusual feature of Coptic is the extensive use of a set of \"second tenses\", which are required in certain syntactic contexts. \"Second tenses\" are also called \"relative tenses\" in some work.\nPrepositions.\nCoptic has prepositions, rather than postpositions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPronominal objects of prepositions are indicated with enclitic pronouns:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMany prepositions have different forms before the enclitic pronouns. Compare:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSyntax.\nSentential syntax.\nCoptic typically shows subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO) word order, as in the following examples:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe verbs in these sentences are in the absolute state grade, which requires that its direct object be introduced with the preposition . This preposition functions like accusative case.\nThere is also an alternative nominal state grade of the verb in which the direct object of the verb follows with no preposition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDialects.\nThere is little written evidence of dialectal differences in the pre-Coptic phases of the Egyptian language due to the centralised nature of the political and cultural institutions of ancient Egyptian society. However, literary Old and Middle (Classical) Egyptian represent the spoken dialect of Lower Egypt around the city of Memphis, the capital of Egypt in the Old Kingdom. Later Egyptian is more representative of the dialects spoken in Upper Egypt, especially around the area of Thebes as it became the cultural and religious center of the New Kingdom.\nCoptic more obviously displays a number of regional dialects that were in use from the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in northern Egypt, south into Nubia, and in the western oases. However, while many of these dialects reflect actual regional linguistic (namely phonological and some lexical) variation, they mostly reflect localized orthographic traditions with very little grammatical differences.\nLower Egyptian dialects.\nBohairic.\nThe Bohairic (also known as Memphitic) dialect originated in the western Nile Delta. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century, but most texts come from the 9th century and later; this may be due to poor preservation conditions for texts in the humid regions of northern Egypt. It shows several conservative features in lexicon and phonology not found in other dialects. Bohairic is the dialect used as the liturgical language of the modern Coptic Orthodox Church, replacing Sahidic some time in the eleventh century. In contemporary liturgical use, there are two traditions of pronunciation, arising from successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries (see Coptic pronunciation reform). Modern revitalisation efforts are based on this dialect.\nBashmuric (also known as Mansurian, Dialect G, and Bashmurian) was a sub-dialect of Bohairic most likely spoken in Eastern Delta. Its main characteristic is using solely Greek letters to represent Coptic phonemes.\nUpper Egyptian dialects.\nSahidic.\nSahidic (also known as Thebaic or Theban) is the dialect in which most known Coptic texts are written, and was the leading dialect in the pre-Islamic period. Where it was spoken is a matter of debate; it name which comes from an Arabic term \"A\u1e63-\u1e63a'id\" meaning Upper [Southern] Egypt would imply it was spoken there, but Sahidic's features seem to suggest it was spoken in the north. It is also possible that Sahidic was the urban dialect spoken in the major urban centers of Thebes and Memphis differentiating it from the other rural dialects. Around 300 it began to be written in literary form, including translations of major portions of the Bible (see Coptic versions of the Bible). By the 6th century, a standardised spelling had been attained throughout Egypt. Almost all native authors wrote in this dialect of Coptic. Sahidic was, beginning in the 9th century, challenged by Bohairic, but is attested as late as the 14th.\nWhile texts in other Coptic dialects are primarily translations of Greek literary and religious texts, Sahidic is the only dialect with a considerable body of original literature and non-literary texts. Because Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic with few peculiarities specific to itself, and has an extensive corpus of known texts, it is generally the dialect studied by learners of Coptic, particularly by scholars outside of the Coptic Church.\nProto-Theban.\nProto-Theban is a dialect of Coptic only attested in a single source, as such information on it is limited but; Proto-Theban closely resembles what reconstructed Proto-Sahidic dialect would have looked like. The variant of the Coptic script used in its singular attestation is also distinct as it contains 10 letters from the Demotic Script which is significantly higher than other dialects.\nFayyumic.\nFayyumic (also known as Crocodilopolic; in older works it is often called Bashmuric) was spoken primarily in the Faiyum west of the Nile Valley. It is attested from the 3rd to the 10th centuries. It is most notable for writing \u2c97 (which corresponds to ), where other dialects generally use \u2ca3 (probably corresponding to a flap ). In earlier stages of Egyptian, the liquids were not distinguished in writing until the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian became the administrative language. Late Egyptian orthography utilised a grapheme that combined the graphemes for and in order to express . Demotic for its part indicated using a diacritic variety of .\nSouth Fayyumic.\nSouth Fayyumic (also called Dialect V) was spoken around modern towns of Beni Suef and Bush and is distinguished from central Fayyumic by not having lambdacism.\nAshmuninic.\nAshmuninic (also known as Hermopolic or Dialect H) was spoken around the city of Shmun and shares South Fayyumic features like vowel gemination and absence of lambdacism.\nOxyrhynchite.\nOxyrhynchite (also known as Mesokemic or, confusingly, Middle Egyptian) is the dialect of Oxyrhynchus and surrounding areas. It shows similarities with Fayyumic and is attested in manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries.\nLycopolitan.\nLycopolitan (also known as Subakhmimic and Assiutic) is a dialect closely related to Akhmimic in terms of when and where it was attested, but manuscripts written in Lycopolitan tend to be from the area of Asyut. The main differences between the two dialects seem to be graphic in nature. The Lycopolitan variety was used extensively for translations of Gnostic and Manichaean works, including the texts of the Nag Hammadi library.\nAkhmimic.\nAkhmimic (also called Chemmic or Panopolic) was the dialect of the area around the town of Akhmim (). It flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries, after which no writings are attested. Akhmimic is phonologically the most archaic of the Coptic dialects. One characteristic feature is the retention of the phoneme , which is realised as in most other dialects.\nAswanic.\nAswanic (also known as Syenic) was the dialect of the area around the town of Aswan. It is very close to Akhmimic, and sometimes considered a sub-dialect, although, what makes it different is that \"\u03e9\" is written before pronouns, for example in normal Coptic it is said \"Afso\", which means drank, but in the Aswanic dialect it is said \"Hafso\". It also has a distinctive way of writing; so the letter \"\u2c83\" is written instead of the letter \"\u03e5\".\nSample text.\nCoptic: \u2ca5\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca5\u2c89 \u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89 \u2c9b\u2c93\u2c99 \u2c89\u2ca9\u03e3\u2c8f\u03e3 \u2c89 \u2c9b\u2c89\u2ca9\u2c89\u2ca3\u2c8f\u2ca9 \u03e9\u2c9b \u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c87\u2c93\u2c95\u2c81\u2c93\u2c9f\u2ca5\u2ca9\u2c9b\u2c8f. \u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c9b \u03ed\u2c9f\u2c99 \u2c99\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9 \u2c89\u2ca7\u2ca3\u2c89\u2ca9\u2c99\u2c89\u2c89\u2ca9\u2c89 \u2c81\u2ca9\u2cb1 \u03e3\u03e3\u2c89 \u2c89\u2ca7\u2ca3\u2c89\u2ca9\u2ca3-\u2c99\u2c9b\u2ca7\u2c99\u2c81\u2c93\u2ca5\u2c9f\u2c9b.\nBohairic Coptic: \u2c88\u0300\u2cab\u0300\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c81\u2c93 \u2ca5\u2c89\u2c99\u2c93\u2ca5\u2c93 \u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u03e9\u2c89\u2ca9 \u2c9b\u2c89\u2c99 \u2c89\u2ca7\u03e3\u2cb1\u03e3 \u2c89\u0300 \u2c81\u2c9d\u2c93\u2c81 \u2c9b\u2c89\u2c99 \u2c87\u2c93\u2c95\u2c81\u2c93\u2c9f\u2ca5\u2ca9\u2c9b\u2c8f. \u2c9a\u0300\u2c91\u2cb1\u2c9f\u2ca9 \u2ca5\u2c89\u2c89\u2ca3\u03e9\u0300\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca7 \u2c85\u2c9b\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c8f \u2c9b\u2c89\u2c99 \u2ca5\u2ca9\u2c9b\u2c8f\u2c87\u2c8f\u2ca5\u2c93\u2ca5 \u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c9f\u03e9 \u2c99\u0300\u2ca1\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c91\u2ca3\u2c89\u2ca9\u2c81\u2ca3\u03e3\u2c8f\u2ca7 \u2c99\u0300\u2c99\u2c89\u2ca7\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93 \u03e9\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c81 \u2c9b\u0300\u2c91\u2cb1\u2c9f\u2ca9 \u2c99\u0300\u2cab\u0300\u2ca3\u2c8f\u03ef \u2c9b\u0300\u2ca5\u0300\u2c9b\u2c8f\u2c9f\u2ca9.\nBohairic Coptic Transliteration: Ephouai semisi remheu nem etsh\u014dsh e axia nem dikaiosun\u0113.

He belonged to the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin.\nEarly life.\nJohann Georg III was born in Dresden, the only son of Johann George II and Magdalene Sybille of Brandenburg-Bayreuth.\nJohn George succeeded his father as elector of Saxony when he died, in 1680; he was also appointed Marshal of the Holy Roman Empire. Because of his courage and his enthusiasm for the War he gained the nickname of the \"\"Saxonian Mars\".\nFrom his childhood, he learned the typical duties and manners of an heir to the throne. That included not only a strictly Lutheran education but also language tuition and instruction in the art of fortress building and warfare.\nIn character he resembled his father. He shared his liking for Italian music and theatre. In 1685 John George III met the Venetian opera singer Margarita Salicola and began a relationship; he brought her to Dresden (not only to work, but also as his official mistress). She began a new era for the opera in Saxony, which had previously been dominated by the \"castrati\". In 1686, the pietist Philipp Jakob Spener became the court chaplain in Dresden. But Spener was not generally accepted there and in 1691 he moved to Brandenburg.\nMeanwhile, the electorate had recovered from the consequences of the Thirty Years' War. By 1689, Dresden had a population of 21,300 and was becoming less provincial. Four years before, in 1685, the old city of Dresden was destroyed by a fire; later, Wolf Caspar von Klengel and Balthasar Permoser were entrusted by the elector with the reconstruction of the city in the baroque style which was the new fashion at the time.\nJohn George showed a strong interest in the military and even while he was still the heir led Saxon Army forces in the Rhine Campaign.\nCareer as elector.\nAfter his accession as Elector, he reduced the size of the royal household and began with the establishment of a small standing army of 12,000 men, after the model of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and managed to extract from the states of the realm a commitment to contribute funds. The Privy War Chancellery (\"geheime Kriegskanzlei\") was set up as the highest military authority. Extreme pressure was used to obtain recruits for the new army. He always neglected home affairs.\nIn foreign policy, he was less inconstant than his father. He broke off relations with the French crown and strove energetically to win Brandenburg and other German princes for the Imperial war against the French aggressor.\nValued as an ally by the Habsburg court, he was nevertheless viewed with extreme distrust and was not able to overall command of all the imperial troops in the face of a Turkish invasion and he did not obtain the means (food supply and winter accommodation) necessary for the maintenance of his auxiliary troops. There was also the matter of John George's wish for Emperor Leopold I to decide a law case concerning a wooded area in the Ore Mountains (\"Erzgebirge\") in his favour. The Emperor did not grant material support until the siege of Vienna made his situation look increasingly desperate. John George eventually led his 10,400 strong army against the Turks. However, there was strong opposition from the estates of Saxony, not only because this expensive campaign was exhausting the finances of the Electorate of Saxony but also because they were not pleased with this support for the catholic Emperor, who had often proceeded harshly against Protestants in his own country. At Tulln, on the Danube, he joined the Imperial army and they set off for the relief of Vienna. In the ensuing Battle of Vienna (12 September 1683) he commanded the left wing, where he demonstrated great personal courage. The battle call selected by the emperor \"Maria Help\"\" (which might carry Roman Catholic connotations) had been previously amended to \"Jesus and Maria help\" at the request of John George.\nKing John III Sobieski of Poland-Lithuainia, who also took part in the battle, said of John George: \"the Elector of Saxony is an honest man with a straight heart\".\nJohn George also accompanied the Emperor after the victory when he entered Vienna. But on 15 September, without taking leave of the Emperor or the other commanders, he set off with his troops on the march back to Saxony, probably as a result of the brusque treatment he had been accorded as a Protestant.\nIn 1686 he again supported Leopold's Turkish War. For payment of 300,000 thalers, he sent a troop of 5,000 men to the Emperor. In 1685 he had already hired out 3,000 Saxon nationals for 120,000 thalers to the Republic of Venice for their Morean War on the Greek Peloponnese Peninsula.\nHe did not join the League of Augsburg of 1686 against France, but he did travel personally to The Hague in March 1688, to discuss with Prince William III of Orange, George William, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, and Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg possible moves against Louis XIV. However, he did not directly support the forthcoming assumption of the English throne by William III.\nFollowing a renewed invasion by France in (1689), he again led his troops into battle to protect Franconia. He later joined the army of Charles V, Duke of Lorraine and took part in the siege of Mainz.\nHe later had to leave the theatre because of an illness but, against the advice of his physicians and advisors, he returned in May 1690 and with a reinforced alliance with the Emperor, took overall command of the imperial army. Success was limited, however, partly owing to personal skirmishes between John George, the Field Marshal Hans Adam von Sch\u00f6ning and the Austrian commander Aeneas de Caprara; only the crossing of the Rhine at Sandhofen succeeded.\nJohn George died shortly after in T\u00fcbingen, where he had been brought, of an epidemic illness, probably Cholera or the Plague. He was buried in the Cathedral of Freiberg.\nChildren.\nJohn George married Anne Sophie, daughter of King Frederick III of Denmark and Norway, in Copenhagen on 9 October 1666. They had two sons:\nHe also had an illegitimate son by his mistress, the opera singer Margarita Salicola:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a member of the House of Wettin. He was the third but eldest surviving son of Frederick Augustus II, Prince-Elector of Saxony and King of Poland (as Augustus III), by his wife, Maria Josepha of Austria.\nEarly life.\nA weak child since his birth, he suffered paralysis in one foot and was dependent on wheelchairs early in life. In a well-known portrait, which shows his Wettin and Wittelsbach relatives around him, he appears in his wheelchair. Today, this painting is shown in the Nymphenburg Palace. His mother tried repeatedly to induce him to take monastic vows and renounce his succession rights in favour of his younger brothers, but he refused.\nThe early deaths of his two older brothers, Frederick Augustus (1721), who was stillborn, and Joseph Augustus (1728), made him the heir to the throne. When his father died, on 5 October 1763, Frederick Christian succeeded him as elector.\nEven before, Frederick Christian had written in his diary: \"Princes exist for their subjects, not subjects for their princes. His subjects' wealth, public credit and a well-standing army make up the true happiness of a prince,\" thereby openly declaring himself open to the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. He was also known for his considerable musical talent.\nMarriage.\nIn Munich on 13 June 1747 (by proxy) and again in Dresden on 20 June 1747 (in person), Frederick Christian married his cousin Maria Antonia of Bavaria. Like him, she was exceptionally talented in music and the couple had nine children.\nReign as Elector.\nOne of his first acts as elector was the dismissal of the extremely unpopular prime minister, the Count Heinrich von Br\u00fchl, who had plunged Saxony into crisis, first with his failed economic policy, but particularly by his catastrophic foreign policy, which caused the electorate to become involved in the Seven Years' War.\nHe began to reconstruct the wrecked finances of his country through his \"R\u00e9tablissements\": reforms of the policies of the electorate states. Through economic reconstruction, he gave new life to the devastated and plundered land which his predecessors had left him. Also introduced were measures to pare down the expenses of the court, and to simplify administration in accordance with principles of economy. Most members of his government, such as Thomas von Fritsch of Leipzig, Friedrich Ludwig Wurmb, and Christian Gotthelf Gutschmied had middle-class origins.\nAfter a reign of only 74 days, Frederick Christian died of smallpox. He was buried in the Hofkirche of Dresden.\nBecause Frederick Christian's eldest son Frederick Augustus III was a minor, his brother Francis Xavier and the Dowager Electress Maria Antonia took the joint regency of the electorate until the boy's majority.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "48489", "revid": "45266726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48489", "title": "Magic (supernatural)", "text": "Practice of supernatural beings and forces\nMagic, sometimes spelled magick, is the application of beliefs, rituals or actions employed in the belief that they can manipulate natural or supernatural beings and forces. It is a category into which have been placed various beliefs and practices sometimes considered separate from both religion and science.\nConnotations have varied from positive to negative at times throughout history. Within Western culture, magic has been linked to ideas of the Other, foreignness, and primitivism; indicating that it is \"a powerful marker of cultural difference\" and likewise, a non-modern phenomenon. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Western intellectuals perceived the practice of magic to be a sign of a primitive mentality and also commonly attributed it to marginalised groups of people.\nEtymology.\nThe English words \"magic\", \"mage\" and \"magician\" come from the Latin term \"magus\", through the Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, which is from the Old Persian \"magu\u0161\". (\ud800\udfb6\ud800\udfa6\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfc1|\ud800\udfb6\ud800\udfa6\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfc1, magician). The Old Persian \"magu-\" is derived from the Proto-Indo-European meg\u02b0-\"*magh\" (be able). The Persian term may have led to the Old Sinitic \"*M\u03b3ag\" (mage or shaman). The Old Persian form seems to have permeated ancient Semitic languages as the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic \"magosh\", the Aramaic \"amgusha\" (magician), and the Chaldean \"maghdim\" (wisdom and philosophy); from the first century BCE onwards, Syrian \"magusai\" gained notoriety as magicians and soothsayers.\nDuring the late-sixth and early-fifth centuries BCE, the term \"goetia\" found its way into ancient Greek, where it was used with negative connotations to apply to rites that were regarded as fraudulent, unconventional, and dangerous; in particular they dedicate themselves to the evocation and invocation of \"daimons\" (lesser divinities or spirits) to control and acquire powers. This concept remained pervasive throughout the Hellenistic period, when Hellenistic authors categorised a diverse range of practices\u2014such as enchantment, witchcraft, incantations, divination, necromancy, and astrology\u2014under the label \"magic\".\nThe Latin language adopted this meaning of the term in the first century BCE. Via Latin, the concept became incorporated into Christian theology during the first century CE. Early Christians associated magic with demons, and thus regarded it as against Christian religion. In early modern Europe, Protestants often claimed that Roman Catholicism was magic rather than religion, and as Christian Europeans began colonizing other parts of the world in the sixteenth century, they labelled the non-Christian beliefs they encountered as magical. In that same period, Italian humanists reinterpreted the term in a positive sense to express the idea of natural magic. Both negative and positive understandings of the term recurred in Western culture over the following centuries.\nSince the nineteenth century, academics in various disciplines have employed the term magic but have defined it in different ways and used it in reference to different things. One approach, associated with the anthropologists Edward Tylor (1832\u20131917) and James G. Frazer (1854\u20131941), uses the term to describe beliefs in hidden sympathies between objects that allow one to influence the other. Defined in this way, magic is portrayed as the opposite to science. An alternative approach, associated with the sociologist Marcel Mauss (1872\u20131950) and his uncle \u00c9mile Durkheim (1858\u20131917), employs the term to describe private rites and ceremonies and contrasts it with religion, which it defines as a communal and organised activity. By the 1990s many scholars were rejecting the term's utility for scholarship. They argued that the label drew arbitrary lines between similar beliefs and practices that were alternatively considered religious, and that it constituted ethnocentric to apply the connotations of magic\u2014rooted in Western and Christian history\u2014to other cultures.\nBranches or types.\nHigh and low.\nHistorians and anthropologists have distinguished between practitioners who engage in high magic, and those who engage in low magic. High magic, also known as theurgy and ceremonial or ritual magic, is more complex, involving lengthy and detailed rituals as well as sophisticated, sometimes expensive, paraphernalia. Low magic and natural magic are associated with peasants and folklore with simpler rituals such as brief, spoken spells. Low magic is also closely associated with sorcery and witchcraft. Anthropologist Susan Greenwood writes that \"Since the Renaissance, high magic has been concerned with drawing down forces and energies from heaven\" and achieving unity with divinity. High magic is usually performed indoors while witchcraft is often performed outdoors.\nWhite, gray and black.\nHistorian Owen Davies says the term \"white witch\" was rarely used before the 20th century. White magic is understood as the use of magic for selfless or helpful purposes, while black magic was used for selfish, harmful or evil purposes. Black magic is the malicious counterpart of the benevolent white magic. There is no consensus as to what constitutes white, gray or black magic, as Phil Hine says, \"like many other aspects of occultism, what is termed to be 'black magic' depends very much on who is doing the defining.\" Gray magic, also called \"neutral magic\", is magic that is not performed for specifically benevolent reasons, but is also not focused towards completely hostile practices.\nWitchcraft.\nThe historian Ronald Hutton notes the presence of four distinct meanings of the term witchcraft in the English language. Historically, the term primarily referred to the practice of causing harm to others through supernatural or magical means. This remains, according to Hutton, \"the most widespread and frequent\" understanding of the term. Moreover, Hutton also notes three other definitions in current usage; to refer to anyone who conducts magical acts, for benevolent or malevolent intent; for practitioners of the modern Pagan religion of Wicca; or as a symbol of women resisting male authority and asserting an independent female authority. Belief in witchcraft is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view.\nThose regarded as being magicians have often faced suspicion from other members of their society. This is particularly the case if these perceived magicians have been associated with social groups already considered morally suspect in a particular society, such as foreigners, women, or the lower classes. In contrast to these negative associations, many practitioners of activities that have been labelled magical have emphasised that their actions are benevolent and beneficial. This conflicted with the common Christian view that all activities categorised as being forms of magic were intrinsically bad regardless of the intent of the magician, because all magical actions relied on the aid of demons. There could be conflicting attitudes regarding the practices of a magician; in European history, authorities often believed that cunning folk and traditional healers were harmful because their practices were regarded as magical and thus stemming from contact with demons, whereas a local community might value and respect these individuals because their skills and services were deemed beneficial.\nIn Western societies, the practice of magic, especially when harmful, was usually associated with women. For instance, during the witch trials of the early modern period, around three quarters of those executed as witches were female, to only a quarter who were men. That women were more likely to be accused and convicted of witchcraft in this period might have been because their position was more legally vulnerable, with women having little or no legal standing that was independent of their male relatives. The conceptual link between women and magic in Western culture may be because many of the activities regarded as magical\u2014from rites to encourage fertility to potions to induce abortions\u2014were associated with the female sphere. It might also be connected to the fact that many cultures portrayed women as being inferior to men on an intellectual, moral, spiritual, and physical level.\nHistory.\nMesopotamia.\nMagic was invoked in many kinds of rituals and medical formulae, and to counteract evil omens. Defensive or legitimate magic in Mesopotamia (\"asiputu\" or \"masmassutu\" in the Akkadian language) were incantations and ritual practices intended to alter specific realities. The ancient Mesopotamians believed that magic was the only viable defense against demons, ghosts, and evil sorcerers. To defend themselves against the spirits of those they had wronged, they would leave offerings known as \"kispu\" in the person's tomb in hope of appeasing them. If that failed, they also sometimes took a figurine of the deceased and buried it in the ground, demanding for the gods to eradicate the spirit, or force it to leave the person alone.\nThe ancient Mesopotamians also used magic intending to protect themselves from evil sorcerers who might place curses on them. Black magic as a category did not exist in ancient Mesopotamia, and a person legitimately using magic to defend themselves against illegitimate magic would use exactly the same techniques. The only major difference was that curses were enacted in secret; whereas a defense against sorcery was conducted in the open, in front of an audience if possible. One ritual to punish a sorcerer was known as Maql\u00fb, or \"The Burning\". The person viewed as being afflicted by witchcraft would create an effigy of the sorcerer and put it on trial at night. Then, once the nature of the sorcerer's crimes had been determined, the person would burn the effigy and thereby break the sorcerer's power over them.\nThe ancient Mesopotamians also performed magical rituals to purify themselves of sins committed unknowingly. One such ritual was known as the \u0160urpu, or \"Burning\", in which the caster of the spell would transfer the guilt for all their misdeeds onto various objects such as a strip of dates, an onion, and a tuft of wool. The person would then burn the objects and thereby purify themself of all sins that they might have unknowingly committed. A whole genre of love spells existed. Such spells were believed to cause a person to fall in love with another person, restore love which had faded, or cause a male sexual partner to be able to sustain an erection when he had previously been unable. Other spells were used to reconcile a man with his patron deity or to reconcile a wife with a husband who had been neglecting her.\nThe ancient Mesopotamians made no distinction between rational science and magic. When a person became ill, doctors would prescribe both magical formulas to be recited as well as medicinal treatments. Most magical rituals were intended to be performed by an \"\u0101\u0161ipu\", an expert in the magical arts. The profession was generally passed down from generation to generation and was held in extremely high regard and often served as advisors to kings and great leaders. An \u0101\u0161ipu probably served not only as a magician, but also as a physician, a priest, a scribe, and a scholar.\nThe Sumerian god Enki, who was later syncretized with the East Semitic god Ea, was closely associated with magic and incantations; he was the patron god of the \"b\u0101r\u0217\" and the \"a\u0161ip\u016b\" and was widely regarded as the ultimate source of all arcane knowledge. The ancient Mesopotamians also believed in omens, which could come when solicited or unsolicited. Regardless of how they came, omens were always taken with the utmost seriousness.\nIncantation bowls.\nA common set of shared assumptions about the causes of evil and how to avert it are found in a form of early protective magic called incantation bowl or magic bowls. The bowls were produced in the Middle East, particularly in Upper Mesopotamia and Syria, what is now Iraq and Iran, and fairly popular during the sixth to eighth centuries. The bowls were buried face down and were meant to capture demons. They were commonly placed under the threshold, courtyards, in the corner of the homes of the recently deceased and in cemeteries. A subcategory of incantation bowls are those used in Jewish magical practice. Aramaic incantation bowls are an important source of knowledge about Jewish magical practices.\nEgypt.\nIn ancient Egypt (\"Kemet\" in the Egyptian language), Magic (personified as the god \"Heka\") was an integral part of religion and culture which is known to us through a substantial corpus of texts which are products of the Egyptian tradition.\nWhile the category magic has been contentious for modern Egyptology, there is clear support for its applicability from ancient terminology. The Coptic term \"hik\" is the descendant of the pharaonic term \"heka\", which, unlike its Coptic counterpart, had no connotation of impiety or illegality, and is attested from the Old Kingdom through to the Roman era. \"Heka\" was considered morally neutral and was applied to the practices and beliefs of both foreigners and Egyptians alike. The Instructions for Merikare informs us that \"heka\" was a beneficence gifted by the creator to humanity \"in order to be weapons to ward off the blow of events\".\nMagic was practiced by both the literate priestly hierarchy and by illiterate farmers and herdsmen, and the principle of \"heka\" underlay all ritual activity, both in the temples and in private settings.\nThe main principle of \"heka\" is centered on the power of words to bring things into being. Karenga explains the pivotal power of words and their vital ontological role as the primary tool used by the creator to bring the manifest world into being. Because humans were understood to share a divine nature with the gods, \"snnw ntr\" (images of the god), the same power to use words creatively that the gods have is shared by humans.\n\"Book of the Dead\".\nThe interior walls of the pyramid of Unas, the final pharaoh of the Egyptian Fifth Dynasty, are covered in hundreds of magical spells and inscriptions, running from floor to ceiling in vertical columns. These inscriptions are known as the Pyramid Texts and they contain spells needed by the pharaoh in order to survive in the afterlife. The Pyramid Texts were strictly for royalty only; the spells were kept secret from commoners and were written only inside royal tombs. During the chaos and unrest of the First Intermediate Period, however, tomb robbers broke into the pyramids and saw the magical inscriptions. Commoners began learning the spells and, by the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, commoners began inscribing similar writings on the sides of their own coffins, hoping that doing so would ensure their own survival in the afterlife. These writings are known as the Coffin Texts.\nAfter a person died, their corpse would be mummified and wrapped in linen bandages to ensure that the deceased's body would survive for as long as possible because the Egyptians believed that a person's soul could only survive in the afterlife for as long as their physical body survived here on earth. The last ceremony before a person's body was sealed away inside the tomb was known as the Opening of the Mouth. In this ritual, the priests would touch various magical instruments to various parts of the deceased's body, thereby giving the deceased the ability to see, hear, taste, and smell in the afterlife.\nAmulets.\nThe use of amulets (\"meket\") was widespread among both living and dead ancient Egyptians. They were used for protection and as a means of \"reaffirming the fundamental fairness of the universe\". The oldest amulets found are from the predynastic Badarian Period, and they persisted through to Roman times.\nJudea.\nIn the Mosaic Law, practices such as witchcraft (), being a soothsayer () or a sorcerer () or one who conjures spells () or one who calls up the dead () are specifically forbidden as abominations to the Lord.\n\"Halakha\" (Jewish religious law) forbids divination and other forms of soothsaying, and the Talmud lists many persistent yet condemned divining practices. Practical Kabbalah in historical Judaism is a branch of the Jewish mystical tradition that concerns the use of magic. It was considered permitted white magic by its practitioners, reserved for the elite, who could separate its spiritual source from qlippothic realms of evil if performed under circumstances that were holy (Q-D-\u0160) and pure (). The concern of overstepping Judaism's strong prohibitions of impure magic ensured it remained a minor tradition in Jewish history. Its teachings include the use of Divine and angelic names for amulets and incantations. These magical practices of Judaic folk religion which became part of practical Kabbalah date from Talmudic times. The Talmud mentions the use of charms for healing, and a wide range of magical cures were sanctioned by rabbis. It was ruled that any practice actually producing a cure was not to be regarded superstitiously and there has been the widespread practice of medicinal amulets, and folk remedies () in Jewish societies across time and geography.\nAlthough magic was forbidden by Levitical law in the Hebrew Bible, it was widely practised in the late Second Temple period, and particularly well documented in the period following the destruction of the temple into the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries CE.\nGreco-Roman world.\nDuring the late sixth and early fifth centuries BCE, the Persian \"magu\u0161\" was Graecicized and introduced into the ancient Greek language as \"\u03bc\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2\" and \"\u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\". In doing so it transformed meaning, gaining negative connotations, with the \"magos\" being regarded as a charlatan whose ritual practices were fraudulent, strange, unconventional, and dangerous. As noted by Davies, for the ancient Greeks\u2014and subsequently for the ancient Romans\u2014\"magic was not distinct from religion but rather an unwelcome, improper expression of it\u2014the religion of the other\". The historian Richard Gordon suggested that for the ancient Greeks, being accused of practicing magic was \"a form of insult\".\nThis change in meaning was influenced by the military conflicts that the Greek city-states were then engaged in against the Persian Empire. In this context, the term makes appearances in such surviving text as Sophocles' \"Oedipus Rex\", Hippocrates' \"De morbo sacro\", and Gorgias' \"Encomium of Helen\". In Sophocles' play, for example, the character Oedipus derogatorily refers to the seer Tiresius as a \"magos\"\u2014in this context meaning something akin to quack or charlatan\u2014reflecting how this epithet was no longer reserved only for Persians.\nIn the first century BCE, the Greek concept of the \"magos\" was adopted into Latin and used by a number of ancient Roman writers as \"magus\" and \"magia\". The earliest known Latin use of the term was in Virgil's \"Eclogue\", written around 40 BCE, which makes reference to \"magicis\u00a0... sacris\" (magic rites). The Romans already had other terms for the negative use of supernatural powers, such as \"veneficus\" and \"saga\". The Roman use of the term was similar to that of the Greeks, but placed greater emphasis on the judicial application of it. Within the Roman Empire, laws would be introduced criminalising things regarded as magic.\nIn ancient Roman society, magic was associated with societies to the east of the empire; the first century CE writer Pliny the Elder for instance claimed that magic had been created by the Iranian philosopher Zoroaster, and that it had then been brought west into Greece by the magician Osthanes, who accompanied the military campaigns of the Persian King Xerxes.\nAncient Greek scholarship of the 20th century, almost certainly influenced by Christianising preconceptions of the meanings of magic and religion, and the wish to establish Greek culture as the foundation of Western rationality, developed a theory of ancient Greek magic as primitive and insignificant, and thereby essentially separate from Homeric, communal (\"polis\") religion. Since the last decade of the century, however, recognising the ubiquity and respectability of acts such as \"katadesmoi\" (binding spells), described as magic by modern and ancient observers alike, scholars have been compelled to abandon this viewpoint. The Greek word \"mageuo\" (practice magic) itself derives from the word \"Magos\", originally simply the Greek name for a Persian tribe known for practicing religion. Non-civic mystery cults have been similarly re-evaluated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the choices which lay outside the range of cults did not just add additional options to the civic menu, but\u00a0... sometimes incorporated critiques of the civic cults and Panhellenic myths or were genuine alternatives to them.\u2014\u200a\n\"Katadesmoi\" (), curses inscribed on wax or lead tablets and buried underground, were frequently executed by all strata of Greek society, sometimes to protect the entire \"polis\". Communal curses carried out in public declined after the Greek classical period, but private curses remained common throughout antiquity. They were distinguished as magical by their individualistic, instrumental and sinister qualities. These qualities, and their perceived deviation from inherently mutable cultural constructs of normality, most clearly delineate ancient magic from the religious rituals of which they form a part.\nA large number of magical papyri, in Greek, Coptic, and Demotic, have been recovered and translated. They contain early instances of:\nThe practice of magic was banned in the late Roman world, and the \"Codex Theodosianus\" (438 AD) states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If any wizard therefore or person imbued with magical contamination who is called by custom of the people a magician\u00a0... should be apprehended in my retinue, or in that of the Caesar, he shall not escape punishment and torture by the protection of his rank.\nMiddle Ages.\nMagic practices such as divination, interpretation of omens, sorcery, and use of charms had been specifically forbidden in Mosaic Law and condemned in Biblical histories of the kings. Many of these practices were spoken against in the New Testament as well.\nSome commentators say that in the first century CE, early Christian authors absorbed the Greco-Roman concept of magic and incorporated it into their developing Christian theology, and that these Christians retained the already implied Greco-Roman negative stereotypes of the term and extended them by incorporating conceptual patterns borrowed from Jewish thought, in particular the opposition of magic and miracle. Some early Christian authors followed the Greek-Roman thinking by ascribing the origin of magic to the human realm, mainly to Zoroaster and Osthanes. The Christian view was that magic was a product of the Babylonians, Persians, or Egyptians. The Christians shared with earlier classical culture the idea that magic was something distinct from proper religion, although drew their distinction between the two in different ways.\nFor early Christian writers like Augustine of Hippo, magic did not merely constitute fraudulent and unsanctioned ritual practices, but was the very opposite of religion because it relied upon cooperation from demons, the henchmen of Satan. In this, Christian ideas of magic were closely linked to the Christian category of paganism, and both magic and paganism were regarded as belonging under the broader category of \"superstitio\" (superstition), another term borrowed from pre-Christian Roman culture. This Christian emphasis on the inherent immorality and wrongness of magic as something conflicting with good religion was far starker than the approach in the other large monotheistic religions of the period, Judaism and Islam. For instance, while Christians regarded demons as inherently evil, the jinn\u2014comparable entities in Islamic mythology\u2014were perceived as more ambivalent figures by Muslims.\nThe model of the magician in Christian thought was provided by Simon Magus, (Simon the Magician), a figure who opposed Saint Peter in both the Acts of the Apostles and the apocryphal yet influential Acts of Peter. The historian Michael D. Bailey stated that in medieval Europe, magic was a \"relatively broad and encompassing category\". Christian theologians believed that there were multiple different forms of magic, the majority of which were types of divination, for instance, Isidore of Seville produced a catalogue of things he regarded as magic in which he listed divination by the four elements i.e. geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy, and pyromancy, as well as by observation of natural phenomena e.g. the flight of birds and astrology. He also mentioned enchantment and ligatures (the medical use of magical objects bound to the patient) as being magical. Medieval Europe also saw magic come to be associated with the Old Testament figure of Solomon; various grimoires, or books outlining magical practices, were written that claimed to have been written by Solomon, most notably the Key of Solomon.\nIn early medieval Europe, \"magia\" was a term of condemnation. In medieval Europe, Christians often suspected Muslims and Jews of engaging in magical practices; in certain cases, these perceived magical rites\u2014including the alleged Jewish sacrifice of Christian children\u2014resulted in Christians massacring these religious minorities. Christian groups often also accused other, rival Christian groups such as the Hussites\u2014which they regarded as heretical\u2014of engaging in magical activities. Medieval Europe also saw the term \"maleficium\" applied to forms of magic that were conducted with the intention of causing harm. The later Middle Ages saw words for these practitioners of harmful magical acts appear in various European languages: \"sorci\u00e8re\" in French, \"Hexe\" in German, \"strega\" in Italian, and \"bruja\" in Spanish. The English term for malevolent practitioners of magic, witch, derived from the earlier Old English term \"wicce\".\nArs Magica or magic is a major component and supporting contribution to the belief and practice of spiritual, and in many cases, physical healing throughout the Middle Ages. Emanating from many modern interpretations lies a trail of misconceptions about magic, one of the largest revolving around wickedness or the existence of nefarious beings who practice it. These misinterpretations stem from numerous acts or rituals that have been performed throughout antiquity, and due to their exoticism from the commoner's perspective, the rituals invoked uneasiness and an even stronger sense of dismissal.\nIn the Medieval Jewish view, the separation of the mystical and magical elements of Kabbalah, dividing it into speculative theological Kabbalah (\"Kabbalah Iyyunit\") with its meditative traditions, and theurgic practical Kabbalah (\"Kabbalah Ma'asit\"), had occurred by the beginning of the 14th century.\nOne societal force in the Middle Ages more powerful than the singular commoner, the Christian Church, rejected magic as a whole because it was viewed as a means of tampering with the natural world in a supernatural manner associated with the biblical verses of Deuteronomy 18:9\u201312. Despite the many negative connotations which surround the term magic, there exist many elements that are seen in a divine or holy light.\nThe divine right of kings in England was thought to be able to give them \"sacred magic\" power to heal thousands of their subjects from sicknesses.\nDiversified instruments or rituals used in medieval magic include, but are not limited to: various amulets, talismans, potions, as well as specific chants, dances, and prayers. Along with these rituals are the adversely imbued notions of demonic participation which influence them. The idea that magic was devised, taught, and worked by demons would have seemed reasonable to anyone who read the Greek magical papyri or the Sefer-ha-Razim and found that healing magic appeared alongside rituals for killing people, gaining wealth, or personal advantage, and coercing women into sexual submission. Archaeology is contributing to a fuller understanding of ritual practices performed in the home, on the body and in monastic and church settings.\nThe Islamic reaction towards magic did not condemn magic in general and distinguished between magic which can heal sickness and possession, and sorcery. The former is therefore a special gift from God, while the latter is achieved through help of Jinn and devils. Ibn al-Nadim held that exorcists gain their power by their obedience to God, while sorcerers please the devils by acts of disobedience and sacrifices and they in return do him a favor. According to Ibn Arabi, Al-\u1e24ajj\u0101j ibn Yusuf al-Shubarbuli was able to walk on water due to his piety. According to the Quran 2:102, magic was also taught to humans by devils and the angels Harut and Marut.\nThe influence of Arab Islamic magic in medieval and Renaissance Europe was very notable. Some magic books such as Picatrix and Al Kindi's De Radiis were the basis for much of medieval magic in Europe and for subsequent developments in the Renaissance. Another Arab Muslim author fundamental to the developments of medieval and Renaissance European magic was Ahmad al-Buni, with his books such as the Shams al-Ma'arif which deal above all with the evocation and invocation of spirits or jinn to control them, obtain powers and make wishes come true. These books are still important to the Islamic world specifically in Simiyya, a doctrine found commonly within Sufi-occult traditions.\nDuring the early modern period, the concept of magic underwent a more positive reassessment through the development of the concept of \"magia naturalis\" (natural magic). This was a term introduced and developed by two Italian humanists, Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. For them, \"magia\" was viewed as an elemental force pervading many natural processes, and thus was fundamentally distinct from the mainstream Christian idea of demonic magic. Their ideas influenced an array of later philosophers and writers, among them Paracelsus, Giordano Bruno, Johannes Reuchlin, and Johannes Trithemius. According to the historian Richard Kieckhefer, the concept of \"magia naturalis\" took \"firm hold in European culture\" during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, attracting the interest of natural philosophers of various theoretical orientations, including Aristotelians, Neoplatonists, and Hermeticists.\nAdherents of this position argued that \"magia\" could appear in both good and bad forms; in 1625, the French librarian Gabriel Naud\u00e9 wrote his \"Apology for all the Wise Men Falsely Suspected of Magic\", in which he distinguished \"Mosoaicall Magick\"\u2014which he claimed came from God and included prophecies, miracles, and speaking in tongues\u2014from \"geotick\" magic caused by demons. While the proponents of \"magia naturalis\" insisted that this did not rely on the actions of demons, critics disagreed, arguing that the demons had simply deceived these magicians. By the seventeenth century the concept of \"magia naturalis\" had moved in increasingly 'naturalistic' directions, with the distinctions between it and science becoming blurred. The validity of \"magia naturalis\" as a concept for understanding the universe then came under increasing criticism during the Age of Enlightenment in the eighteenth century.\nDespite the attempt to reclaim the term \"magia\" for use in a positive sense, it did not supplant traditional attitudes toward magic in the West, which remained largely negative. At the same time as \"magia naturalis\" was attracting interest and was largely tolerated, Europe saw an active persecution of accused witches believed to be guilty of \"maleficia\". Reflecting the term's continued negative associations, Protestants often sought to denigrate Roman Catholic sacramental and devotional practices as being magical rather than religious. Many Roman Catholics were concerned by this allegation and for several centuries various Roman Catholic writers devoted attention to arguing that their practices were religious rather than magical. At the same time, Protestants often used the accusation of magic against other Protestant groups which they were in contest with. In this way, the concept of magic was used to prescribe what was appropriate as religious belief and practice.\nSimilar claims were also being made in the Islamic world during this period. The Arabian cleric Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab\u2014founder of Wahhabism\u2014for instance condemned a range of customs and practices such as divination and the veneration of spirits as \"sihr\", which he in turn claimed was a form of \"shirk\", the sin of idolatry.\nThe Renaissance.\nRenaissance humanism saw a resurgence in hermeticism and Neo-Platonic varieties of ceremonial magic. The Renaissance, on the other hand, saw the rise of science, in such forms as the dethronement of the Ptolemaic theory of the universe, the distinction of astronomy from astrology, and of chemistry from alchemy.\nThere was great uncertainty in distinguishing practices of superstition, occultism, and perfectly sound scholarly knowledge or pious ritual. The intellectual and spiritual tensions erupted in the Early Modern witch craze, further reinforced by the turmoil of the Protestant Reformation, especially in Germany, England, and Scotland.\nIn Hasidism, the displacement of practical Kabbalah using directly magical means, by conceptual and meditative trends gained much further emphasis, while simultaneously instituting meditative theurgy for material blessings at the heart of its social mysticism. Hasidism internalised Kabbalah through the psychology of deveikut (cleaving to God), and cleaving to the Tzadik (Hasidic Rebbe). In Hasidic doctrine, the tzaddik channels Divine spiritual and physical bounty to his followers by altering the Will of God (uncovering a deeper concealed Will) through his own deveikut and self-nullification. Dov Ber of Mezeritch is concerned to distinguish this theory of the Tzadik's will altering and deciding the Divine Will, from directly magical process.\nIn the sixteenth century, European societies began to conquer and colonise other continents around the world, and as they did so they applied European concepts of magic and witchcraft to practices found among the peoples whom they encountered. Usually, these European colonialists regarded the natives as primitives and savages whose belief systems were diabolical and needed to be eradicated and replaced by Christianity. Because Europeans typically viewed these non-European peoples as being morally and intellectually inferior to themselves, it was expected that such societies would be more prone to practicing magic. Women who practiced traditional rites were labelled as witches by the Europeans.\nIn various cases, these imported European concepts and terms underwent new transformations as they merged with indigenous concepts. In West Africa, for instance, Portuguese travellers introduced their term and concept of the \"feiti\u00e7aria\" (often translated as sorcery) and the \"feiti\u00e7o\" (spell) to the native population, where it was transformed into the concept of the fetish. When later Europeans encountered these West African societies, they wrongly believed that the \"fetiche\" was an indigenous African term rather than the result of earlier inter-continental encounters. Sometimes, colonised populations themselves adopted these European concepts for their own purposes. In the early nineteenth century, the newly independent Haitian government of Jean-Jacques Dessalines began to suppress the practice of Vodou, and in 1835 Haitian law-codes categorised all Vodou practices as \"sortil\u00e8ge\" (sorcery/witchcraft), suggesting that it was all conducted with harmful intent, whereas among Vodou practitioners the performance of harmful rites was already given a separate and distinct category, known as \"maji\".\nBaroque period.\nDuring the Baroque era, several intriguing figures engaged with occult and magical themes that went beyond conventional thinking. Michael Sendivogius (1566\u20131636), a Polish alchemist, emphasized empirical experimentation in alchemy and made notable contributions to early chemistry. Tommaso Campanella (1568\u20131639), an Italian philosopher, blended Christianity with mysticism in works like \"The City of the Sun\", envisioning an ideal society governed by divine principles. Jakob B\u00f6hme (1575\u20131624), a German mystic, explored the relationship between the divine and human experience, influencing later mystical movements.\nJan Baptist van Helmont, a Flemish chemist, coined the term \"gas\" and conducted experiments on plant growth, expanding the understanding of chemistry. Sir Kenelm Digby, known for his diverse interests, created the \"Sympathetic Powder\", believed to have mystical healing properties. Isaac Newton, famous for his scientific achievements, also delved into alchemy and collected esoteric manuscripts, revealing his fascination with hidden knowledge. These individuals collectively embody the curiosity and exploration characteristic of the Baroque period.\nModernity.\nBy the nineteenth century, European intellectuals no longer saw the practice of magic through the framework of sin and instead regarded magical practices and beliefs as \"an aberrational mode of thought antithetical to the dominant cultural logic\u2014a sign of psychological impairment and marker of racial or cultural inferiority\".\nAs educated elites in Western societies increasingly rejected the efficacy of magical practices, legal systems ceased to threaten practitioners of magical activities with punishment for the crimes of diabolism and witchcraft, and instead threatened them with the accusation that they were defrauding people through promising to provide things which they could not.\nThis spread of European colonial power across the world influenced how academics would come to frame the concept of magic. In the nineteenth century, several scholars adopted the traditional, negative concept of magic. That they chose to do so was not inevitable, for they could have followed the example adopted by prominent esotericists active at the time like Helena Blavatsky who had chosen to use the term and concept of magic in a positive sense.\nVarious writers also used the concept of magic to criticise religion by arguing that the latter still displayed many of the negative traits of the former. An example of this was the American journalist H. L. Mencken in his polemical 1930 work \"Treatise on the Gods\"; he sought to critique religion by comparing it to magic, arguing that the division between the two was misplaced. The concept of magic was also adopted by theorists in the new field of psychology, where it was often used synonymously with superstition, although the latter term proved more common in early psychological texts.\nIn the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, folklorists examined rural communities across Europe in search of magical practices, which at the time they typically understood as survivals of ancient belief systems. It was only in the 1960s that anthropologists like Jeanne Favret-Saada also began looking in depth at magic in European contexts, having previously focused on examining magic in non-Western contexts. In the twentieth century, magic also proved a topic of interest to the Surrealists, an artistic movement based largely in Europe; the Surrealist Andr\u00e9 Breton for instance published \"L'Art magique\" in 1957, discussing what he regarded as the links between magic and art.\nThe scholarly application of magic as a \"sui generis\" category that can be applied to any socio-cultural context was linked with the promotion of modernity to both Western and non-Western audiences.\nThe term magic has become pervasive in the popular imagination and idiom.\nIn contemporary contexts, the word magic is sometimes used to \"describe a type of excitement, of wonder, or sudden delight\", and in such a context can be \"a term of high praise\". Despite its historical contrast against science, scientists have also adopted the term in application to various concepts, such as magic acid, magic bullets, and magic angles.\nModern Western magic has challenged widely-held preconceptions about contemporary religion and spirituality.\nThe polemical discourses about magic influenced the self-understanding of modern magicians, several whom\u2014such as Aleister Crowley\u2014were well versed in academic literature on the subject.\nAccording to scholar of religion Henrik Bogdan, \"arguably the best known emic definition\" of the term magic was provided by Crowley. Crowley\u2014who favoured the spelling 'magick' over magic to distinguish it from stage illusionism\u2014was of the view that \"Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will\". Crowley's definition influenced that of subsequent magicians. Dion Fortune, the founder of Fraternity of the Inner Light for instance stated that \"Magic is the art of changing consciousness according to Will\". Gerald Gardner, the founder of Gardnerian Wicca, stated that magic was \"attempting to cause the physically unusual\", while Anton LaVey, the founder of LaVeyan Satanism, described magic as \"the change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally acceptable methods, be unchangeable\".\nThe chaos magic movement emerged during the late 20th century, as an attempt to strip away the symbolic, ritualistic, theological or otherwise ornamental aspects of other occult traditions and distill magic down to a set of basic techniques.\nThese modern Western concepts of magic rely on a belief in correspondences connected to an unknown occult force that permeates the universe. As noted by Hanegraaff, this operated according to \"a \"new\" meaning of magic, which could not possibly have existed in earlier periods, precisely because it is elaborated in reaction to the 'disenchantment of the world'\".\nFor many, and perhaps most, modern Western magicians, the goal of magic is deemed to be personal spiritual development. The perception of magic as a form of self-development is central to the way that magical practices have been adopted into forms of modern Paganism and the New Age phenomenon. One significant development within modern Western magical practices has been sex magic. This was a practice promoted in the writings of Paschal Beverly Randolph and subsequently exerted a strong interest on occultist magicians like Crowley and Theodor Reuss.\nThe adoption of the term magic by modern occultists can in some instances be a deliberate attempt to champion those areas of Western society which have traditionally been marginalised as a means of subverting dominant systems of power. The influential American Wiccan and author Starhawk for instance stated that \"Magic is another word that makes people uneasy, so I use it deliberately, because the words we are comfortable with, the words that sound acceptable, rational, scientific, and intellectually correct, are comfortable precisely because they are the language of estrangement.\" In the present day, \"among some countercultural subgroups the label is considered 'cool'\".\nConceptual development.\nAccording to anthropologist Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard, magic formed a rational framework of beliefs and knowledge in some cultures, like the Azande people of Africa. The historian Owen Davies stated that the word magic was \"beyond simple definition\", and had \"a range of meanings\". Similarly, the historian Michael D. Bailey characterised magic as \"a deeply contested category and a very fraught label\"; as a category, he noted, it was \"profoundly unstable\" given that definitions of the term have \"varied dramatically across time and between cultures\". Scholars have engaged in extensive debates as to how to define magic, with such debates resulting in intense dispute. Throughout such debates, the scholarly community has failed to agree on a definition of magic, in a similar manner to how they have failed to agree on a definition of religion. According with scholar of religion Michael Stausberg the phenomenon of people applying the concept of magic to refer to themselves and their own practices and beliefs goes as far back as late antiquity. However, even among those throughout history who have described themselves as magicians, there has been no common ground of what magic is.\nIn Africa, the word magic might simply be understood as denoting management of forces, which, as an activity, is not weighted morally and is accordingly a neutral activity from the start of a magical practice, but by the will of the magician, is thought to become and to have an outcome which represents either good or bad (evil). Ancient African culture was in the habit customarily of always discerning difference between magic, and a group of other things, which are not magic, these things were medicine, divination, witchcraft and sorcery. Opinion differs on how religion and magic are related to each other with respect development or to which developed from which, some think they developed together from a shared origin, some think religion developed from magic, and some, magic from religion.\nAnthropological and sociological theories of magic generally serve to sharply demarcate certain practices from other, otherwise similar practices in a given society. According to Bailey: \"In many cultures and across various historical periods, categories of magic often define and maintain the limits of socially and culturally acceptable actions in respect to numinous or occult entities or forces. Even more, basically, they serve to delineate arenas of appropriate belief.\" In this, he noted that \"drawing these distinctions is an exercise in power\". This tendency has had repercussions for the study of magic, with academics self-censoring their research because of the effects on their careers.\nRandall Styers noted that attempting to define magic represents \"an act of demarcation\" by which it is juxtaposed against \"other social practices and modes of knowledge\" such as religion and science. The historian Karen Louise Jolly described magic as \"a category of exclusion, used to define an unacceptable way of thinking as either the opposite of religion or of science\".\nModern scholarship has produced various definitions and theories of magic. According to Bailey, \"these have typically framed magic in relation to, or more\nfrequently in distinction from, religion and science.\" Since the emergence of the study of religion and the social sciences, magic has been a \"central theme in the theoretical literature\" produced by scholars operating in these academic disciplines. Magic is one of the most heavily theorized concepts in the study of religion, and also played a key role in early theorising within anthropology. Styers believed that it held such a strong appeal for social theorists because it provides \"such a rich site for articulating and contesting the nature and boundaries of modernity\". Scholars have commonly used it as a foil for the concept of religion, regarding magic as the \"illegitimate (and effeminized) sibling\" of religion. Alternately, others have used it as a middle-ground category located between religion and science.\nThe context in which scholars framed their discussions of magic was informed by the spread of European colonial power across the world in the modern period.\nThese repeated attempts to define magic resonated with broader social concerns, and the pliability of the concept has allowed it to be \"readily adaptable as a polemical and ideological tool\". The links that intellectuals made between magic and those they characterized as primitives helped to legitimise European and Euro-American imperialism and colonialism, as these Western colonialists expressed the view that those who believed in and practiced magic were unfit to govern themselves and should be governed by those who, rather than believing in magic, believed in science and/or (Christian) religion. In Bailey's words, \"the association of certain peoples [whether non-Europeans or poor, rural Europeans] with magic served to distance and differentiate them from those who ruled over them, and in large part to justify that rule.\"\nMany different definitions of magic have been offered by scholars, although\u2014according to Hanegraaff\u2014these can be understood as variations of a small number of heavily influential theories.\nIntellectualist approach.\nThe intellectualist approach to defining magic is associated with two British anthropologists, Edward Tylor and James G. Frazer. This approach viewed magic as the theoretical opposite of science, and came to preoccupy much anthropological thought on the subject. This approach was situated within the evolutionary models which underpinned thinking in the social sciences during the early 19th century. The first social scientist to present magic as something that predated religion in an evolutionary development was Herbert Spencer; in his \"A System of Synthetic Philosophy\", he used the term magic in reference to sympathetic magic. Spencer regarded both magic and religion as being rooted in false speculation about the nature of objects and their relationship to other things.\nTylor's understanding of magic was linked to his concept of animism. In his 1871 book \"Primitive Culture\", Tylor characterized magic as beliefs based on \"the error of mistaking ideal analogy for real analogy\". In Tylor's view, \"primitive man, having come to associate in thought those things which he found by experience to be connected in fact, proceeded erroneously to invert this action, and to conclude that association in thought must involve similar connection in reality. He thus attempted to discover, to foretell, and to cause events by means of processes which we can now see to have only an ideal significance\". Tylor was dismissive of magic, describing it as \"one of the most pernicious delusions that ever vexed mankind\". Tylor's views proved highly influential, and helped to establish magic as a major topic of anthropological research.\nTylor's ideas were adopted and simplified by James Frazer. He used the term magic to mean sympathetic magic, describing it as a practice relying on the magician's belief \"that things act on each other at a distance through a secret sympathy\", something which he described as \"an invisible ether\". He further divided this magic into two forms, the \"homeopathic (imitative, mimetic)\" and the \"contagious\". The former was the idea that \"like produces like\", or that the similarity between two objects could result in one influencing the other. The latter was based on the idea that contact between two objects allowed the two to continue to influence one another at a distance. Like Taylor, Frazer viewed magic negatively, describing it as \"the bastard sister of science\", arising from \"one great disastrous fallacy\".\nWhere Frazer differed from Tylor was in characterizing a belief in magic as a major stage in humanity's cultural development, describing it as part of a tripartite division in which magic came first, religion came second, and eventually science came third. For Frazer, all early societies started as believers in magic, with some of them moving away from this and into religion. He believed that both magic and religion involved a belief in spirits but that they differed in the way that they responded to these spirits. For Frazer, magic \"constrains or coerces\" these spirits while religion focuses on \"conciliating or propitiating them\". He acknowledged that their common ground resulted in a cross-over of magical and religious elements in various instances; for instance he claimed that the sacred marriage was a fertility ritual which combined elements from both world-views.\nSome scholars retained the evolutionary framework used by Frazer but changed the order of its stages; the German ethnologist Wilhelm Schmidt argued that religion\u2014by which he meant monotheism\u2014was the first stage of human belief, which later degenerated into both magic and polytheism. Others rejected the evolutionary framework entirely. Frazer's notion that magic had given way to religion as part of an evolutionary framework was later deconstructed by the folklorist and anthropologist Andrew Lang in his essay \"Magic and Religion\"; Lang did so by highlighting how Frazer's framework relied upon misrepresenting ethnographic accounts of beliefs and practices among indigenous Australians to fit his concept of magic.\nFunctionalist approach.\nThe functionalist approach to defining magic is associated with the French sociologists Marcel Mauss and Emile Durkheim.\nIn this approach, magic is understood as being the theoretical opposite of religion.\nMauss set forth his conception of magic in a 1902 essay, \"A General Theory of Magic\". Mauss used the term magic in reference to \"any rite that is not part of an organized cult: a rite that is private, secret, mysterious, and ultimately tending towards one that is forbidden\". Conversely, he associated religion with organised cult. By saying that magic was inherently non-social, Mauss had been influenced by the traditional Christian understandings of the concept. Mauss deliberately rejected the intellectualist approach promoted by Frazer, believing that it was inappropriate to restrict the term magic to sympathetic magic, as Frazer had done. He expressed the view that \"there are not only magical rites which are not sympathetic, but neither is sympathy a prerogative of magic, since there are sympathetic practices in religion\".\nMauss' ideas were adopted by Durkheim in his 1912 book \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\". Durkheim was of the view that both magic and religion pertained to \"sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden\". Where he saw them as being different was in their social organisation. Durkheim used the term magic to describe things that were inherently anti-social, existing in contrast to what he referred to as a Church, the religious beliefs shared by a social group; in his words, \"There is no Church of magic.\" Durkheim expressed the view that \"there is something inherently anti-religious about the maneuvers of the magician\", and that a belief in magic \"does not result in binding together those who adhere to it, nor in uniting them into a group leading a common life.\" Durkheim's definition encounters problems in situations\u2014such as the rites performed by Wiccans\u2014in which acts carried out communally have been regarded, either by practitioners or observers, as being magical.\nScholars have criticized the idea that magic and religion can be differentiated into two distinct, separate categories. The social anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown suggested that \"a simple dichotomy between magic and religion\" was unhelpful and thus both should be subsumed under the broader category of ritual. Many later anthropologists followed his example.\nNevertheless, this distinction is still often made by scholars discussing this topic.\nEmotionalist approach.\nThe emotionalist approach to magic is associated with the English anthropologist Robert Ranulph Marett, the Austrian Sigmund Freud, and the Polish anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski.\nMarett viewed magic as a response to stress. In a 1904 article, he argued that magic was a cathartic or stimulating practice designed to relieve feelings of tension. As his thought developed, he increasingly rejected the idea of a division between magic and religion and began to use the term \"magico-religious\" to describe the early development of both. Malinowski similarly understood magic to Marett, tackling the issue in a 1925 article. He rejected Frazer's evolutionary hypothesis that magic was followed by religion and then science as a series of distinct stages in societal development, arguing that all three were present in each society. In his view, both magic and religion \"arise and function in situations of emotional stress\" although whereas religion is primarily expressive, magic is primarily practical. He therefore defined magic as \"a practical art consisting of acts which are only means to a definite end expected to follow later on\". For Malinowski, magical acts were to be carried out for a specific end, whereas religious ones were ends in themselves. He for instance believed that fertility rituals were magical because they were carried out with the intention of meeting a specific need. As part of his functionalist approach, Malinowski saw magic not as irrational but as something that served a useful function, being sensible within the given social and environmental context.\nThe term magic was used liberally by Freud. He also saw magic as emerging from human emotion but interpreted it very differently to Marett.\nFreud explains that \"the associated theory of magic merely explains the paths along which magic proceeds; it does not explain its true essence, namely the misunderstanding which leads it to replace the laws of nature by psychological ones\". Freud emphasizes that what led primitive men to come up with magic is the power of wishes: \"His wishes are accompanied by a motor impulse, the will, which is later destined to alter the whole face of the earth to satisfy his wishes. This motor impulse is at first employed to give a representation of the satisfying situation in such a way that it becomes possible to experience the satisfaction by means of what might be described as motor hallucinations. This kind of representation of a satisfied wish is quite comparable to children's play, which succeeds their earlier purely sensory technique of satisfaction. [...] As time goes on, the psychological accent shifts from the \"motives\" for the magical act on to the \"measures\" by which it is carried out\u2014that is, on to the act itself. [...] It thus comes to appear as though it is the magical act itself which, owing to its similarity with the desired result, alone determines the occurrence of that result.\"\nIn the early 1960s, the anthropologists Murray and Rosalie Wax put forward the argument that scholars should look at the magical worldview of a given society on its own terms rather than trying to rationalize it in terms of Western ideas about scientific knowledge. Their ideas were heavily criticised by other anthropologists, who argued that they had set up a false dichotomy between non-magical Western worldviews and magical non-Western worldviews. The concept of the magical worldview nevertheless gained widespread use in history, folkloristics, philosophy, cultural theory, and psychology. The notion of magical thinking has also been utilised by various psychologists. In the 1920s, the psychologist Jean Piaget used the concept as part of his argument that children were unable to clearly differentiate between the mental and the physical. According to this perspective, children begin to abandon their magical thinking between the ages of six and nine.\nAccording to Stanley Tambiah, magic, science, and religion all have their own \"quality of rationality\", and have been influenced by politics and ideology. As opposed to religion, Tambiah suggests that mankind has a much more personal control over events. Science, according to Tambiah, is \"a system of behavior by which man acquires mastery of the environment.\"\nEthnocentrism.\nThe magic-religion-science triangle developed in European society based on evolutionary ideas i.e. that magic evolved into religion, which in turn evolved into science. However using a Western analytical tool when discussing non-Western cultures, or pre-modern forms of Western society, raises problems as it may impose alien Western categories on them. While magic remains an emic (insider) term in the history of Western societies, it remains an etic (outsider) term when applied to non-Western societies and even within specific Western societies. For this reason, academics like Michael D. Bailey suggest abandoning the term altogether as an academic category. During the twentieth century, many scholars focusing on Asian and African societies rejected the term magic, as well as related concepts like witchcraft, in favour of the more precise terms and concepts that existed within these specific societies like Juju. A similar approach has been taken by many scholars studying pre-modern societies in Europe, such as Classical antiquity, who find the modern concept of magic inappropriate and favour more specific terms originating within the framework of the ancient cultures which they are studying. Alternately, this term implies that all categories of magic are ethnocentric and that such Western preconceptions are an unavoidable component of scholarly research. This century has seen a trend towards emic ethnographic studies by scholar practitioners that explicitly explore the emic/etic divide.\nMany scholars have argued that the use of the term as an analytical tool within academic scholarship should be rejected altogether. The scholar of religion Jonathan Z. Smith for example argued that it had no utility as an etic term that scholars should use. The historian of religion Wouter Hanegraaff agreed, on the grounds that its use is founded in conceptions of Western superiority and has \"...served as a 'scientific' justification for converting non-European peoples from benighted superstitions...\" stating that \"the term magic is an important object \"of\" historical research, but not intended \"for\" doing research.\"\nBailey noted that, as of the early 21st century, few scholars sought grand definitions of magic but instead focused with \"careful attention to particular contexts\", examining what a term like magic meant to a given society; this approach, he noted, \"call[ed] into question the legitimacy of magic as a universal category\". The scholars of religion Berndt-Christian Otto and Michael Stausberg suggested that it would be perfectly possible for scholars to talk about amulets, curses, healing procedures, and other cultural practices often regarded as magical in Western culture without any recourse to the concept of magic itself. The idea that magic should be rejected as an analytic term developed in anthropology, before moving into Classical studies and Biblical studies in the 1980s. Since the 1990s, the term's usage among scholars of religion has declined.\nMagicians.\nMany of the practices which have been labelled magic can be performed by anyone. For instance, some charms can be recited by individuals with no specialist knowledge nor any claim to having a specific power. Others require specialised training in order to perform them. Some of the individuals who performed magical acts on a more than occasional basis came to be identified as magicians, or with related concepts like sorcerers/sorceresses, witches, or cunning folk. Identities as a magician can stem from an individual's own claims about themselves, or it can be a label placed upon them by others. In the latter case, an individual could embrace such a label, or they could reject it, sometimes vehemently.\nEconomic incentives can encourage individuals to identify as magicians. In the cases of various forms of traditional healers, as well as the later stage magicians or illusionists, the label of magician could become a job description. Others claim such an identity out of a genuinely held belief that they have specific unusual powers or talents. Different societies have different social regulations regarding who can take on such a role; for instance, it may be a question of familial heredity, or there may be gender restrictions on who is allowed to engage in such practices. A variety of personal traits may be credited with giving magical power, and frequently they are associated with an unusual birth into the world. For instance, in Hungary it was believed that a \"t\u00e1ltos\" would be born with teeth or an additional finger. In various parts of Europe, it was believed that being born with a caul would associate the child with supernatural abilities. In some cases, a ritual initiation is required before taking on a role as a specialist in such practices, and in others it is expected that an individual will receive a mentorship from another specialist.\nDavies noted that it was possible to \"crudely divide magic specialists into religious and lay categories\". He noted for instance that Roman Catholic priests, with their rites of exorcism, and access to holy water and blessed herbs, could be conceived as being magical practitioners. Traditionally, the most common method of identifying, differentiating, and establishing magical practitioners from common people is by initiation. By means of rites the magician's relationship to the supernatural and his entry into a closed professional class is established (often through rituals that simulate death and rebirth into a new life). However, Berger and Ezzy explain that since the rise of Neopaganism, \"As there is no central bureaucracy or dogma to determine authenticity, an individual's self-determination as a Witch, Wiccan, Pagan or Neopagan is usually taken at face value\". Ezzy argues that practitioners' worldviews have been neglected in many sociological and anthropological studies and that this is because of \"a culturally narrow understanding of science that devalues magical beliefs\".\nMauss argues that the powers of both specialist and common magicians are determined by culturally accepted standards of the sources and the breadth of magic: a magician cannot simply invent or claim new magic. In practice, the magician is only as powerful as his peers believe him to be.\nThroughout recorded history, magicians have often faced skepticism regarding their purported powers and abilities. For instance, in sixteenth-century England, the writer Reginald Scot wrote \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\", in which he argued that many of those accused of witchcraft or otherwise claiming magical capabilities were fooling people using illusionism.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48503", "revid": "41048884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48503", "title": "Provence", "text": "Historical province in southeastern France\nProvence is a geographical region and historical province of southeastern France, which stretches from the left bank of the lower Rh\u00f4ne to the west to the Italian border to the east; it is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It largely corresponds with the modern administrative region of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur and includes the departments of Var, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, as well as parts of Alpes-Maritimes and Vaucluse. The largest city of the region and its modern-day capital is Marseille.\nThe Romans made the region the first Roman province beyond the Alps and called it \"Provincia Romana\", which evolved into the present name. Until 1481 it was ruled by the counts of Provence from their capital in Aquae Sextiae (today Aix-en-Provence), then became a province of the kings of France. It also hosted the Avignon papacy in the middle ages, when the Pope and his Curia fled Rome. While the region has been part of France for more than 500 years, it still retains a distinct cultural and linguistic identity, particularly in the interior of the region.\nEtymology.\nThe region got its name in Roman times, when it was known as \"Provincia Romana\", simply \"the Roman province\". This name eventually was shortened to Provincia (the province), and as the language evolved from Latin to Proven\u00e7al, so did the pronunciation and spelling.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric Provence.\nThe coast of Provence has some of the earliest known sites of human habitation in Europe. Primitive stone tools dating back 1 to 1.05\u00a0million years BC have been found in the Grotte du Vallonnet near Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, between Monaco and Menton. More sophisticated tools, worked on both sides of the stone and dating to 600,000 BC, were found in the Cave of Escale at Saint-Est\u00e8ve-Janson; tools from 400,000 BC and some of the first fireplaces in Europe were found at Terra Amata in Nice. Tools dating to the Middle Paleolithic (300,000 BC) and Upper Paleolithic (30,000\u201310,000 BC) were discovered in the Observatory Cave, in the Jardin Exotique of Monaco.\nThe Paleolithic period in Provence saw great changes in the climate. Two ice ages came and went, and the sea level changed dramatically. At the beginning of the Paleolithic, the sea level in western Provence was 150 meters higher than today. By the end of the Paleolithic, it had dropped to 100 to 150 metres below the sea level today. The cave dwellings of the early inhabitants of Provence were regularly flooded by the rising sea or left far from the sea and swept away by erosion.\nThe changes in the sea level led to one of the most remarkable discoveries of signs of early man in Provence. In 1985, a diver named Henri Cosquer discovered the mouth of a submarine cave 37 metres below the surface of the Calanque de Morgiou near Marseille. The entrance led to a cave above sea level. Inside, the walls of the Cosquer Cave are decorated with drawings of bison, seals, auks, horses and outlines of human hands, dating to between 27,000 and 19,000 BC.\nThe end of the Paleolithic and beginning of the Neolithic period saw the sea settle at its present level, a warming of the climate and the retreat of the forests. The disappearance of the forests and the deer and other easily hunted game meant that the inhabitants of Provence had to survive on rabbits, snails and wild sheep. In about 6000 BC, the Castelnovian people, living around Ch\u00e2teauneuf-les-Martigues, were among the first people in Europe to domesticate wild sheep, and to cease moving constantly from place to place. Once they settled in one place they were able to develop new industries. Inspired by pottery from the eastern Mediterranean, in about 6000 BC they created the first pottery made in France.\nAround 6000 BC, a wave of new settlers from the east, the Chass\u00e9ens, arrived in Provence. They were farmers and warriors, and gradually displaced the earlier pastoral people from their lands. They were followed about 2500 BC by another wave of people, also farmers, known as the Courronniens, who arrived by sea and settled along the coast of what is now the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. Traces of these early civilisations can be found in many parts of Provence. A Neolithic site dating to about 6,000 BC was discovered in Marseille near the Saint-Charles railway station. and a dolmen from the Bronze Age (2500\u2013900 BC) can be found near Draguignan.\nLigures and Celts in Provence.\nBetween the 10th and 4th century BC, the Ligures were found in Provence from Massilia as far as modern Liguria. They were of uncertain origin; they may have been the descendants of the indigenous Neolithic peoples. According to Strabo, the Ligurians, living in proximity to numerous Celtic mountain tribes, were a different people (), but \"were similar to the Celts in their modes of life\". They did not have their own alphabet, but their language remains in place names in Provence ending in the suffixes -\"asc\", -\"osc\", -\"inc\", -\"ates\", and -\"auni\". The ancient geographer Posidonius wrote of them: \"Their country is savage and dry. The soil is so rocky that you cannot plant anything without striking stones. The men compensate for the lack of wheat by hunting... They climb the mountains like goats.\" They were also warlike; they invaded Italy and went as far as Rome in the 4th century BC, and they later aided the passage of Hannibal, on his way to attack Rome (218 BC). Traces of the Ligures remain today in the dolmens and other megaliths found in eastern Provence, in the primitive stone shelters called 'Bories' found in the Luberon and Comtat, and in the rock carvings in the Valley of Marvels near Mont B\u00e9go in the Alpes-Maritimes, at an altitude of 2,000 meters.\nBetween the 8th and 5th centuries BC, tribes of Celtic peoples, probably coming from Central Europe, also began moving into Provence. They had weapons made of iron, which allowed them to easily defeat the local tribes, who were still armed with bronze weapons. One tribe, called the Segobriga, settled near modern-day Marseille. The Caturiges, Tricastins, and Cavares settled to the west of the Durance river.\nCelts and Ligurians spread throughout the area and the Celto-Ligures eventually shared the territory of Provence, each tribe in its own alpine valley or settlement along a river, each with its own king and dynasty. They built hilltop forts and settlements, later given the Latin name . Today the traces of 165 are found in the Var, and as many as 285 in the Alpes-Maritimes. They worshipped various aspects of nature, establishing sacred woods at Sainte-Baume and Gemenos, and healing springs at Glanum and Vern\u00e8gues. Later, in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the different tribes formed confederations; the Voconces in the area from the Is\u00e8re to the Vaucluse; the Cavares in the Comtat; and the Salyens, from the Rh\u00f4ne river to the Var. The tribes began to trade their local products, iron, silver, alabaster, marble, gold, resin, wax, honey and cheese; with their neighbours, first by trading routes along the Rh\u00f4ne river, and later Etruscan traders visited the coast. Etruscan amphorae from the 7th and 6th centuries BC have been found in Marseille, Cassis, and in hilltop \"oppida\" in the region.\nGreeks in Provence.\nTraders from the island of Rhodes were visiting the coast of Provence in the 7th century BC. Rhodes pottery from that century has been found in Marseille, near Martigues and Istres, and at Mont Garou and Evenos near Toulon. The traders from Rhodes gave their names to the ancient town of Rhodanousia () (now Trinquetaille, across the Rh\u00f4ne river from Arles), and to the main river of Provence, the Rhodanos, today known as the Rh\u00f4ne.\nThe first permanent Greek settlement was Massalia, established at modern-day Marseille in about 600 BC by colonists coming from Phocaea (now Fo\u00e7a, on the Aegean coast of Asia Minor). A second wave of colonists arrived in about 540 BC, when Phocaea was destroyed by the Persians.\nMassalia became one of the major trading ports of the ancient world. At its height, in the 4th century BC, it had a population of about 6,000 inhabitants, living on about fifty hectares surrounded by a wall. It was governed as an aristocratic republic, by an assembly of the 600 wealthiest citizens. It had a large temple of the cult of Apollo of Delphi on a hilltop overlooking the port, and a temple of the cult of Artemis of Ephesus at the other end of the city. The Drachma coins minted in Massalia were found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul. Traders from Massalia ventured inland deep into France on the Rivers Durance and Rh\u00f4ne, and established overland trade routes deep into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy, and as far north as the Baltic Sea. They exported their own products; local wine, salted pork and fish, aromatic and medicinal plants, coral and cork.\nThe Massalians also established a series of small colonies and trading posts along the coast; which later became towns; they founded \"Citharista\" (La Ciotat); \"Tauroeis\" (Le Brusc); \"Olbia\" (near Hy\u00e8res); \"Pergantion\" (Breganson); \"Caccabaria\" (Cavalaire); \"Athenopolis\" (Saint-Tropez); \"Antipolis\" (Antibes); \"Nikaia\" (Nice), and \"Monoicos\" (Monaco). They established inland towns at \"Glanum\" (Saint-Remy) and \"Mastrabala\" (Saint-Blaise).\nThe most famous citizen of Massalia was the mathematician, astronomer and navigator Pytheas. Pytheas made mathematical instruments which allowed him to establish almost exactly the latitude of Marseille, and he was the first scientist to observe that the tides were connected with the phases of the moon. Between 330 and 320 BC he organised an expedition by ship into the Atlantic and as far north as England, and to visit Iceland, Shetland, and Norway. He was the first scientist to describe drift ice and the midnight sun. Though he hoped to establish a sea trading route for tin from Cornwall, his trip was not a commercial success, and it was not repeated. The Massalians found it cheaper and simpler to trade with Northern Europe over land routes.\nRoman Provence (2nd century BC to 5th century AD).\nIn the 2nd century BC the people of Massalia appealed to Rome for help against the Ligures. Roman legions entered Provence three times; first in 181 BC the Romans suppressed Ligurian uprisings near Genoa; in 154 BC the Roman Consul Optimus defeated the Oxybii and the Deciates, who were attacking Antibes; and in 125 BC, the Romans put down an uprising of a confederation of Celtic tribes. After this battle, the Romans decided to establish permanent settlements in Provence. In 122 BC, next to the Celtic town of Entremont, the Romans built a new town, \"Aquae Sextiae\", later called Aix-en-Provence. In 118 BC they founded \"Narbo\" (Narbonne).\nThe Roman general Gaius Marius crushed the last serious resistance in 102 BC by defeating the Cimbri and the Teutons. He then began building roads to facilitate troop movements and commerce between Rome, Spain and Northern Europe; one from the coast inland to Apt and Tarascon, and the other along the coast from Italy to Spain, passing through Fr\u00e9jus and Aix-en-Provence.\nIn 49 BC, Massalia had the misfortune to choose the wrong side in the power struggle between Pompey and Julius Caesar. Pompey was defeated, and Massalia lost its territories and political influence. Roman veterans, in the meantime, populated two new towns, Arles and Fr\u00e9jus, at the sites of older Greek settlements.\nIn 8 BC the Emperor Augustus built a triumphal monument at La Turbie to commemorate the pacification of the region, and he began to Romanize Provence politically and culturally. Roman engineers and architects built monuments, theatres, baths, villas, fora, arenas and aqueducts, many of which still exist. (See Architecture of Provence.) Roman towns were built at Cavaillon; Orange; Arles; Fr\u00e9jus; Glanum (outside Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence); Carpentras; Vaison-la-Romaine; N\u00eemes; Vern\u00e8gues; Saint-Chamas and Cimiez (above Nice). The Roman province, which was called Gallia Narbonensis, for its capital, Narbo (modern Narbonne), extended from Italy to Spain, from the Alps to the Pyrenees.\nThe Pax Romana in Provence lasted until the middle of the 3rd century. Germanic tribes invaded Provence in 257 and 275. At the beginning the 4th century, the court of Roman Emperor Constantine (ca. 272\u2013337) was forced to take refuge in Arles. By the end of the 5th century, Roman power in Provence had vanished, and an age of invasions, wars, and chaos began.\nArrival of Christianity (3rd\u20136th centuries).\nThere are many legends about the earliest Christians in Provence, but they are difficult to verify. It is documented that there were organised churches and bishops in the Roman towns of Provence as early as the 3rd and 4th centuries; in Arles in 254; Marseille in 314; Orange, Vaison and Apt in 314; Cavaillon, Digne, Embrun, Gap, and Fr\u00e9jus at the end of the 4th century; Aix-en-Provence in 408; Carpentras, Avignon, Riez, Cimiez (today part of Nice) and Vence in 439; Antibes in 442; Toulon in 451; Senez in 406, Saint-Paul-Trois-Ch\u00e2teaux in 517; and Gland\u00e8ves in 541.\nThe oldest Christian structure still surviving in Provence is the baptistery of the Fr\u00e9jus Cathedral, dating from the 5th century. At about the same time, the first two monasteries in Provence were founded: L\u00e9rins Abbey, on the island of Saint-Honorat near Cannes, and Abbey of St Victor in Marseille.\nGermanic invasions, Merovingians and Carolingians (5th\u20139th centuries).\nBeginning in the second half of the 5th century, as Roman power waned, successive waves of Germanic tribes entered Provence: first the Visigoths (480), then the Ostrogoths, then the Burgundians, finally, the Franks in the 6th century. Arab invaders and Berber pirates came from North Africa to the Coast of Provence in the early 7th century.\nDuring the late 7th and the early 8th centuries, Provence was formally subject to the Frankish kings of the Merovingian dynasty, but it was in fact ruled by its own regional nobility of Gallo-Roman stock, which ruled themselves according to Roman, not Frankish, law. Actually, the region enjoyed more prestige than the northern Franks had, but the local aristocracy feared Charles Martel's expansionist ambitions. In 737, Charles Martel headed down the Rh\u00f4ne Valley after subduing Burgundy. He attacked Avignon and Arles, garrisoned by the Umayyads, and came back in 739 to capture for a second time Avignon and chase the duke Maurontus to his stronghold of Marseille. The city was brought to heel and the duke had to flee to an island. The region was thereafter under the rule of Carolingian kings, descended from Charles Martel, and then was part of the empire of Charlemagne (742\u2013814).\nIn 879, after the death of the Carolingian ruler Charles the Bald, Boso of Provence (also known as Boson), his brother-in-law, broke away from the Carolingian kingdom of Louis III and was elected the first ruler of an independent state of Provence.\nFraxinet, the Counts of Provence (9th\u201313th centuries).\nThree different dynasties of counts ruled Provence during the Middle Ages, and Provence became a prize in the complex rivalries between the Catalan rulers of Barcelona, the kings of Burgundy, the German rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Angevin kings of France.\nThe Bosonids (879\u20131112) were the descendants of the first king of Provence, Boson. His son, Louis the Blind (890\u2013928), lost his sight trying to win the throne of Italy, after which his cousin, Hugh of Italy (died 947), became the duke of Provence and the count of Vienne. Hugh moved the capital of Provence from Vienne to Arles and made Provence a fief of Rudolph II of Burgundy.\nIn the 9th century, Arab pirates (called Saracens by the French) and then the Normans invaded Provence. The Normans pillaged the region and then left, but the Saracens built castles and began raiding towns and holding local residents for ransom. The conquering Arabs established the emirate of Fraxinet in 887. Early in 973, the Saracens captured Maieul, the abbot of the monastery at Cluny, and held him for ransom. The ransom was paid and the abbot was released, but the people of Provence, led by Count William I, rose up and defeated the Saracens near their most powerful fortress (La Garde-Freinet) at the Battle of Tourtour. The Saracens who were not killed in the battle were baptised and enslaved, and the remaining Saracens in Provence fled the region.\nMeanwhile, dynastic quarrels continued. A war between Rudolph III of Burgundy and his rival, German emperor Conrad the Salic led in 1032 to Provence becoming a fiefdom of the Holy Roman Empire, which it remained until 1246.\nIn 1112, the last descendant of Boson, Douce I, Countess of Provence, married the Catalan Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, who as a result became Raymond Berenguer I, Count of Provence. He ruled Provence from 1112 until 1131, and his descendants, the Catalan counts, ruled in Provence until 1246. In 1125, Provence was divided; the part of Provence north and west of the Durance river went to the Count of Toulouse, while the lands between the Durance and the Mediterranean, and from the Rh\u00f4ne river to the Alps, belonged to the counts of Provence. The capital of Provence was moved from Arles to Aix-en-Provence, and later to Brignoles.\nUnder the Catalan counts, the 12th century saw the construction of important cathedrals and abbeys in Provence, in a harmonious new style, the Romanesque, which united the Gallo-Roman style of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley with the Lombard style of the Alps. Aix Cathedral was built on the site of the old Roman forum, and then rebuilt in the Gothic style in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Church of St. Trophime in Arles was a landmark of Romanesque architecture, built between the 12th and the 15th centuries. A vast fortress-like monastery, Montmajour Abbey, was built on an island just north of Arles and became a major destination for medieval pilgrims.\nIn the 12th century, three Cistercian monasteries were built in remote parts of Provence, far from the political intrigues of the cities. S\u00e9nanque Abbey was the first, established in the Luberon between 1148 and 1178. Thoronet Abbey was founded in a remote valley near Draguignan in 1160. Silvacane Abbey, on the Durance river at La Roque-d'Anth\u00e9ron, was founded in 1175.\nIn the 13th century, the French kings started to use marriage to extend their influence into the south of France. One son of King Louis VIII \"the Lion\", Alphonse, Count of Poitou, married the heiress of the Count of Toulouse, Joan. Another, Louis IX \"the Saint\" of France or Saint Louis (1214\u20131270), married Marguerite of Provence. Then, in 1246, Charles, Count of Anjou, the youngest son of Louis VIII, married the heiress of Provence, Beatrice. Provence's fortunes became tied to the Angevin Dynasty and the Kingdom of Naples.\nThe popes in Avignon (14th century).\nIn 1309, Pope Clement V, who was originally from Bordeaux, moved the Papal Curia to Avignon, a period known as the Avignon Papacy. From 1309 until 1377, seven popes reigned in Avignon before the Schism between the Roman and Avignon churches, which led to the creation of rival popes in both places. After that, three antipopes reigned in Avignon until 1423, when the papacy finally returned to Rome. Between 1334 and 1363 the old and new Papal Palaces of Avignon were built by Popes Benedict XII and Clement VI respectively; together the Palais des Papes was the largest Gothic palace in Europe.\nThe 14th century was a terrible time in Provence, and all of Europe: the population of Provence had been about 400,000 people; the Black Death (1348\u20131350) killed fifteen thousand people in Arles, half the population of the city, and greatly reduced the population of the whole region. The defeat of the French Army during the Hundred Years' War forced the cities of Provence to build walls and towers to defend themselves against armies of former soldiers who ravaged the countryside.\nThe Angevin rulers of Provence also had a difficult time. An assembly of nobles, religious leaders, and town leaders of Provence was organised to resist the authority of Queen Joan I of Naples (1343\u20131382). She was murdered in 1382 by her cousin and heir, Charles of Durazzo, who started a new war, leading to the separation of Nice, Puget-Th\u00e9niers and Barcelonnette from Provence in 1388, and their attachment to the County of Savoy. From 1388 up to 1526, the area acquired by the Savoy was known as \"Terres Neuves de Provence\"; after 1526 it officially took on the name County of Nice.\nGood King Ren\u00e9, the last ruler of Provence.\nThe 15th century saw a series of wars between the kings of Aragon and the counts of Provence. In 1423 the army of Alphonse of Aragon captured Marseille, and in 1443 they captured Naples, and forced its ruler, King Ren\u00e9 I of Naples, to flee. He eventually settled in one of his remaining territories, Provence.\nHistory and legend has given Ren\u00e9 the title \"Good King Ren\u00e9 of Provence\", though he only lived in Provence in the last ten years of his life, from 1470 to 1480, and his political policies of territorial expansion were costly and unsuccessful. Provence benefitted from population growth and economic expansion, and Ren\u00e9 was a generous patron of the arts, sponsoring painters Nicolas Froment, Louis Br\u00e9a, and other masters. He also completed one of the finest castles in Provence at Tarascon, on the Rh\u00f4ne river.\nWhen Ren\u00e9 died in 1480, his title passed to his nephew Charles du Maine. One year later, in 1481, when Charles died, the title passed to Louis XI of France. Provence was legally incorporated into the French royal domain in 1486.\n1486 to 1789.\nSoon after Provence became part of France, it became involved in the Wars of Religion that swept the country in the 16th century. Between 1493 and 1501, many Jews were expelled from their homes and sought sanctuary in the region of Avignon, which was still under the direct rule of the Pope. In 1545, the Parlement of Aix-en-Provence ordered the destruction of the villages of Lourmarin, M\u00e9rindol, Cabri\u00e9res in the Luberon, because their inhabitants were Vaudois, of Italian Piedmontese origin, and were not considered sufficiently orthodox Catholics. Most of Provence remained strongly Catholic, though Protestants controlled the Principality of Orange, an enclave ruled by William of the House of Orange-Nassau of the Netherlands, who inherited it in 1544 and which was not incorporated into France until 1673. An army of the Catholic League laid siege to the Protestant town of M\u0117nerbes in the Vaucluse between 1573 and 1578. The wars did not stop until the end of the 16th century, with the consolidation of power in Provence by the Bourbon kings.\nThe semi-independent Parliament of Provence in Aix and some of the cities of Provence, particularly Marseille, continued to rebel against the authority of the Bourbon king. After uprisings in 1630\u201331 and 1648\u20131652, the young King Louis XIV had two large forts, fort St. Jean and Fort St. Nicholas, built at the harbour entrance to control the city's unruly population.\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu began to build a naval arsenal and dockyard at Toulon to serve as a base for a new French Mediterranean fleet. The base was greatly enlarged by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the minister of Louis XIV, who also commissioned his chief military engineer Vauban to strengthen the fortifications around the city.\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, Provence had a population of about 450,000 people. It was predominantly rural, devoted to raising wheat, wine, and olives, with small industries for tanning, pottery, perfume-making, and ship and boat building. Proven\u00e7al quilts, made from the mid-17th century onwards, were successfully exported to England, Spain, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. There was considerable commerce along the coast, and up and down the Rh\u00f4ne river. The cities: Marseille, Toulon, Avignon and Aix-en-Provence, saw the construction of boulevards and richly decorated private houses.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Provence suffered from the economic malaise of the end of the reign of Louis XIV. The Great Plague of Marseille struck the region between 1720 and 1722, beginning in Marseille, killing some 40,000 people. Still, by the end of the century, many artisanal industries began to flourish; making perfumes in Grasse; olive oil in Aix and the Alpilles; textiles in Orange, Avignon and Tarascon; and faience pottery in Marseille, Apt, Aubagne, and Moustiers-Sainte-Marie. Many immigrants arrived from Liguria and the Piedmont in Italy. By the end of the 18th century, Marseille had a population of 120,000 people, making it the third largest city in France.\nDuring the French Revolution.\nMost of Provence, with the exception of Marseille, Aix and Avignon, was rural, conservative and largely royalist, and the Revolution was as violent and bloody in Provence as it was in other parts of France. On 30 April 1790, Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille was besieged, and many of the soldiers inside were massacred. On 17 October 1791, a massacre of royalists and religious figures took place in the ice storage rooms () of the prison of the Palace of the Popes in Avignon.\nWhen the radical Montagnards seized power from the Girondins in May 1793, a real counter-revolution broke out in Avignon, Marseille and Toulon. A revolutionary army under General Carteaux recaptured Marseille in August 1793 and renamed it \"City without a Name\" (.) In Toulon, the opponents of the Revolution handed the city to a British and Spanish fleet on 28 August 1793. A Revolutionary Army laid siege to the British positions for four months (see the Siege of Toulon) and finally, the enterprise of the young commander of artillery, Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the British and drove them out in December 1793. About 15,000 royalists escaped with the British fleet, but five to eight hundred of the 7,000 who remained were shot on the Champ de Mars, and Toulon was renamed .\nThe fall of the Montagnards in July 1794 was followed by a new White Terror aimed at the revolutionaries. Calm was not restored until the rise of the Directory to power in 1795.\nProvence produced some memorable figures in the French Revolution; both moderates such as the comte de Mirabeau and figures of the far left such as the Marquis de Sade; there was also the military figure Charles Barbaroux and the theorist Emmanuel-Joseph Siey\u00e8s (1748\u20131836), who instigated the coup of 18 Brumaire which brought Napoleon to power. The revolutionary anthem despite its origins on the Rhine got its name because revolutionary volunteers from Marseille sang it on the streets of Paris.\nUnder Napoleon.\nNapoleon restored the belongings and power of the families of the Ancien R\u00e9gime in Provence. The British fleet of Admiral Horatio Nelson blockaded Toulon, and almost all maritime commerce was stopped, causing hardship and poverty. When Napoleon was defeated, his fall was celebrated in Provence. When he escaped from Elba on 1 March 1815, and landed at Golfe-Juan, he detoured to avoid the cities of Provence, which were hostile to him, and therefore directed his small force directly to the northeast of it.\n19th century.\nProvence enjoyed prosperity in the 19th century; the ports of Marseille and Toulon connected Provence with the expanding French Empire in North Africa and the Orient, especially after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.\nIn April\u2013July 1859, Napoleon III made a secret agreement with Cavour, Prime Minister of Piedmont, for France to assist in expelling Austria from the Italian Peninsula and bringing about a united Italy, in exchange for Piedmont ceding Savoy and the Nice region to France. He went to war with Austria in 1859 and won a victory at Solferino, which resulted in Austria ceding Lombardy to France. France immediately ceded Lombardy to Piedmont, and, in return, Napoleon received Savoy and Nice in 1860, and Roquebrune-Cap-Martin and Menton in 1861.\nThe railroad connected Paris with Marseille (1848) and then with Toulon and Nice (1864). Nice, Antibes and Hy\u00e8res became popular winter resorts for European royalty, including Queen Victoria. Under Napoleon III, Marseille grew to a population of 250,000, including a very large Italian community. Toulon had a population of 80,000. The large cities like Marseille and Toulon saw the building of churches, opera houses, grand boulevards, and parks.\nAfter the fall of Louis Napoleon following the defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, barricades went up in the streets of Marseille (23 March 1871) and the Communards, led by Gaston Cremieux and following the lead of the Paris Commune, took control of the city. The Commune was crushed by the army and Cremieux was executed on 30 November 1871. Though Provence was generally conservative, it often elected reformist leaders; Prime Minister L\u00e9on Gambetta was the son of a Marseille grocer, and future prime minister Georges Clemenceau was elected deputy of Var in 1885.\nThe second half of the 19th century saw a revival of the Proven\u00e7al language and culture, particularly traditional rural values. driven by a movement of writers and poets called the F\u00e9librige, led by poet Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral. Mistral achieved literary success with his poem Mir\u00e8io (\"Mireille\" in French); he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1904.\n20th century.\nBetween World War I and World War II, Provence was bitterly divided between the more conservative rural areas and the more radical big cities. There were widespread strikes in Marseille in 1919, and riots in Toulon in 1935.\nAfter the defeat of France by Germany in June 1940, France was divided into an occupied zone and unoccupied zone, with Provence in the unoccupied zone. Parts of eastern Provence were occupied by Italian soldiers. Collaboration and passive resistance gradually gave way to more active resistance, particularly after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Communist Party became active in the resistance. Jean Moulin, the deputy of Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the Free France resistance movement, was parachuted into Eygali\u00e8res, in the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne on 2 January 1942 to unite the diverse resistance movements in all of France against the Germans.\nIn November 1942, following Allied landings in North Africa (Operation Torch), the Germans occupied all of Provence (Operation Attila) and then headed for Toulon (Case Anton). The French fleet at Toulon sabotaged its own ships to keep them from falling into German hands.\nThe Germans began a systematic rounding-up of French Jews and refugees from Nice and Marseille. Many thousands were taken to concentration camps, and few survived. A large quarter around the port of Marseille was emptied of inhabitants and dynamited, so it would not serve as a base for the resistance. Nonetheless, the resistance grew stronger; the leader of the pro-German militia, the Milice, in Marseille was assassinated in April 1943.\nOn 15 August 1944, two months after the Allied landings in Normandy (Operation Overlord), the Seventh United States Army under General Alexander Patch, with a Free French corps under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, landed on the coast of Var between St. Raphael and Cavalaire (Operation Dragoon). The American forces moved north toward Manosque, Sisteron and Gap, while the French First Armored Division under General Vigier liberated Brignoles, Salon, Arles, and Avignon. The Germans in Toulon resisted until 27 August, and Marseille was not liberated until 25 August.\nAfter the end of the war, Provence faced an enormous task of reconstruction, particularly of the ports and railroads destroyed during the war. As part of this effort, the first modern concrete apartment block, the Unit\u00e9 d'habitation of Corbusier, was built in Marseille in 1947\u201352. In 1962, Provence absorbed a large number of French citizens who left Algeria after its independence. Since that time, large North African communities settled in and around the big cities, particularly Marseille and Toulon.\nIn the 1940s, Provence underwent a cultural renewal, with the founding of the Avignon Festival of theatre (1947), the reopening of the Cannes Film Festival (begun in 1939), and many other major events. With the building of new highways, particularly the Paris Marseille autoroute which opened in 1970, Provence became destination for mass tourism from all over Europe. Many Europeans, particularly from Britain, bought summer houses in Provence. The arrival of the TGV high-speed trains shortened the trip from Paris to Marseille to less than four hours.\nIn recent years, residents of Provence have struggled to reconcile economic development and population growth with their desire to preserve the region's unique landscape and culture.\nGeography.\nThe original Roman province was called Gallia Transalpina, then Gallia Narbonensis, or simply \"Provincia Nostra\" ('Our Province') or \"Provincia\". It extended from the Alps to the Pyrenees and north to the Vaucluse, with its capital in Narbo Martius (present-day Narbonne).\nLocation and borders.\nIn the 15th century, the County of Provence was bordered by the river Var on the east and the Rh\u00f4ne to the west, with the Mediterranean to the south, and a northern border that roughly followed the Durance. Bordering it on the northwest were two territories that had earlier formed part of Provence, i.e., the Comtat Venaissin, centered on Avignon which was ruled by the pope from the 13th century until the French Revolution, and, just north of this, the Principality of Orange, that through inheritance became a possession of William the Silent, who became the founder of the present ruling house of the Netherlands, the House of Orange-Nassau. The principality was independent between the 12th century and 1673 when it was occupied and then annexed by Louis XIV during one of his wars with its prince, Dutch stadtholder William III, the future king of England. At the end of the 14th century, another piece of Provence along the Italian border, including Nice and the lower Alps, was detached from Provence and attached to the lands of the duke of Savoy. The lower Alps were re-attached to France after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, but Nice did not return to France until 1860, during the reign of Napoleon III.\nThe administrative region of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur was created in 1982. It included Provence, plus the territory of the Comtat Venaissin around Avignon, and the Principality of Orange, the eastern portion of the Dauphin\u00e9, and the former County of Nice.\nThe area immediately to the north, in the Drome, is sometimes referred to as the , given its very similar features and landscapes.\nRivers.\nThe Rh\u00f4ne river, on the western border of Provence, is one of the major rivers of France, and has been a highway of commerce and communications between inland France and the Mediterranean for centuries. It rises as the effluent of the Rh\u00f4ne Glacier in Valais, Switzerland, in the Saint-Gotthard massif, at an altitude of 1753 m. It is joined by the river Sa\u00f4ne at Lyon. Along the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, it is joined on the right bank by the rivers Eyrieux, Ard\u00e8che, C\u00e8ze and Gardon (or Gard), on the left Alps bank by rivers Is\u00e8re, Dr\u00f4me, Ouv\u00e8ze and Durance. At Arles, the Rh\u00f4ne divides itself in two arms, forming the Camargue delta, with all branches flowing into the Mediterranean Sea. One arm is called the \"Grand Rh\u00f4ne\"; the other one is the \"Petit Rh\u00f4ne\".\nThe Durance river, a tributary of the Rh\u00f4ne, has its source in the Alps near Brian\u00e7on. It flows south-west through Embrun, Sisteron, Manosque, Cavaillon, and Avignon, where it meets the Rh\u00f4ne.\nThe Verdon River is a tributary of the Durance, rising at an altitude of 2,400 metres in the southwestern Alps near Barcelonette, and flowing southwest for 175 kilometres through the departments of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Var before it reaches the Durance at near Vinon-sur-Verdon, south of Manosque. The Verdon is best known for its canyon, the Verdon Gorge. This limestone canyon, also called the 'Grand Canyon of Verdon', 20 kilometres in length and more than 300 metres deep, is a popular climbing and sight-seeing area.\nThe Var River rises near the Col de la Cayolle () in the Maritime Alps and flows generally southeast for into the Mediterranean between Nice and Saint-Laurent-du-Var. Before Nice was returned to France in 1860, the Var marked the eastern border of France along the Mediterranean. The Var is the unique case in France of a river giving a name to a department, but not flowing through that department (due to subsequent adjustments to the department's boundaries).\nCamargue.\nWith an area of over , Camargue is western Europe's largest river delta (technically an island, as it is wholly surrounded by water). It is a vast plain comprising large brine lagoons or \"\u00e9tangs\", cut off from the sea by sandbars and encircled by reed-covered marshes which are in turn surrounded by a large cultivated area. It is home to more than 400 species of birds, the brine ponds providing one of the few European habitats for the greater flamingo.\nMountains.\nBy considering the Maritime Alps, along the border with Italy, as a part of the cultural Provence, they constitute the highest elevations of the region (the Punta dell'Argentera has an elevation of 3,297 m). They form the border between the French \"d\u00e9partement\" Alpes-Maritimes and the Italian province of Cuneo. Mercantour National Park is located in the Maritime Alps. On the other hand, if the \"d\u00e9partement\" Hautes Alpes is also considered as part of the modern Provence, then the alpin \u00c9crins mountains represent the highest elevations of the region with the Barre des \u00c9crins culminating at 4102m.\nOutside of the Maritime Alps, Mont Ventoux (Occitan: Ventor in classical norm or Ventour in Mistralian norm), at , is the highest peak in Provence. It is located some 20\u00a0km north-east of Carpentras, Vaucluse. On the north side, the mountain borders the Dr\u00f4me d\u00e9partement. It is nicknamed the \"Giant of Provence\", or \"The Bald Mountain\". Although geologically part of the Alps, is often considered to be separate from them, due to the lack of mountains of a similar height nearby. It stands alone to the west of the Luberon range, and just to the east of the Dentelles de Montmirail, its foothills. The top of the mountain is bare limestone without vegetation or trees. The white limestone on the mountain's barren peak means it appears from a distance to be snow-capped all year round (its snow cover actually lasts from December to April).\nThe Alpilles are a chain of small mountains located about south of Avignon. Although they are not particularly high \u2013 only some at their highest point \u2013 the Alpilles stand out since they rise abruptly from the plain of the Rh\u00f4ne valley. The range is about 25\u00a0km long by about 8 to 10\u00a0km wide, running in an east\u2013west direction between the Rh\u00f4ne and Durance rivers. The landscape of the Alpilles is one of arid limestone peaks separated by dry valleys.\nMontagne Sainte-Victoire is probably the best-known mountain in Provence, thanks to the painter Paul C\u00e9zanne, who could see it from his home, and painted it frequently.\nIt is a limestone mountain ridge which extends over 18 kilometres between the d\u00e9partements of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and Var. Its highest point is the \"Pic des mouches\" at 1,011\u00a0m.\nThe Massif des Maures (Moor Mountains) is a small chain of mountains that lies along the coast of the Mediterranean in the department of Var, between Hy\u00e8res et Fr\u00e9jus. Its highest point is the signal de la Sauvette, 780 metres high. The name is a souvenir of the Moors (\"Maures\" in Old French), Arabs and Berbers from North Africa, who settled on the coast of Provence in the 9th and 10th centuries. The Massif des Maures extends about sixty kilometres along the coast, and reaches inland about thirty kilometres. On the north it is bordered by a depression which is followed by the \"routes nationales\" 97 and 7, and the railroad line between Toulon and Nice. On the south it ends abruptly at the Mediterranean, forming a broken and abrupt coastline.\nThe peninsula of Saint-Tropez is part of the Massif des Maures, along with the Giens Peninsula and the islands offshore of Hy\u00e8res; Porquerolles, Port-Cros, and \u00eele du Levant. Cape Sici\u00e9, west of Toulon, as well as the Massif de Tanneron, belong geologically to the Massif des Maures.\nThe Calanques.\nThe Calanques form a dramatic feature of the Provence coast, a 20-km long series of narrow inlets in the cliffs of the coastline between Marseille on the west and Cassis on the east. The best known examples of this formation can be found in the Massif des Calanques. The highest peak in the massif is Mont Puget, 565 metres high.\nThe best known calanques of the Massif des Calanques include the Calanque de Sormiou, the Calanque de Morgiou, the Calanque d'En-Vau, the Calanque de Port-Pin and the Calanque de Sugiton.\nThe calanques are remains of ancient river mouths formed mostly during Tertiary. Later, during Quaternary glaciation, as glaciers swept by, they further deepened those valleys which would eventually (at the end of the last glaciation) be invaded by the sea and become calanques.\nThe Cosquer cave is an underwater grotto in the Calanque de Morgiou, underwater, that was inhabited during Paleolithic era, when the sea level was much lower than today. Its walls are covered with paintings and engravings dating back to between 27,000 and 19,000 BC, depicting animals such as bison, ibex, and horses, as well as sea mammals such as seals, and at least one bird, the auk.\nLandscapes.\nThe garrigue is the typical landscape of Provence; it is a type of low, soft-leaved scrubland or chaparral found on limestone soils around the Mediterranean Basin, generally near the seacoast, where the climate is moderate, but where there are annual summer drought conditions. Juniper and stunted holm oaks are the typical trees; aromatic lime-tolerant shrubs such as lavender, sage, rosemary, wild thyme and \"Artemisia\" are common garrigue plants. The open landscape of the garrigue is punctuated by dense thickets of Kermes oak.\nClimate.\nMost of Provence has a Mediterranean climate, characterised by hot, dry summers, mild winters, little snow, and abundant sunshine. Within Provence there are micro-climates and local variations, ranging from the Alpine climate inland from Nice to the continental climate in the northern Vaucluse. The winds of Provence are an important feature of the climate, particularly the mistral, a cold, dry wind which, especially in the winter, blows down the Rh\u00f4ne Valley to the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the Var Departments, and often reaches over one hundred kilometres an hour.\nBouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne.\nMarseille, in the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, has an average of 59 days of rain a year, though when it does rain the rain is often torrential; the average annual rainfall is 544.4\u00a0mm. It snows an average of 2.3 days a year, and the snow rarely remains long. Marseille has an average of 2835.5 hours of sunshine a year. The average minimum temperature in January is 2.3\u00a0\u00b0C., and the average maximum temperature in July is 29.3\u00a0\u00b0C. The mistral blows an average of one hundred days a year.\nVar.\nToulon and Var, which includes St. Tropez and Hy\u00e8res, have a climate slightly warmer, dryer and sunnier than Nice and the Alpes-Maritime, but also less sheltered from the wind. Toulon has an average of 2899.3 hours of sunshine a year, making it the sunniest city in metropolitan France, The average maximum daily temperature in August is 29.1\u00a0\u00b0C., and the average daily minimum temperature in January is 5.8\u00a0\u00b0C. The average annual rainfall is 665\u00a0mm, with the most rain from October to November. Strong winds blow an average of 118 days a year in Toulon, compared with 76 days at Fr\u00e9jus further east. The strongest Mistral wind recorded in Toulon was 130 kilometres an hour.\nAlpes-Maritimes.\nNice and the Alpes-Maritimes department are sheltered by the Alps, and are the most protected part of the Mediterranean coast. The winds in this department are usually gentle, blowing from the sea to the land, though sometimes the mistral blows strongly from the northwest, or, turned by the mountains, from the east. In 1956, a mistral wind from the northwest reached the speed of 180 kilometres an hour at Nice airport. Sometimes in summer the sirocco brings high temperatures and reddish desert sand from Africa (see Winds of Provence).\nRainfall is infrequent, 63 days a year, but can be torrential, particularly in September, when storms and rain are caused by the difference between the colder air inland and the warm Mediterranean water temperature (20\u201324 degrees\u00a0C.). The average annual rainfall in Nice is 767\u00a0mm, more than in Paris, but concentrated in fewer days.\nSnow is extremely rare, usually falling once every ten years. 1956 was a very exceptional year, when 20 centimetres of snow blanketed the coast. In January 1985 the coast between Cannes and Menton received 30 to 40 centimetres of snow. In the mountains, the snow is present from November to May.\nNice has an annual average of 2694 hours of sunshine. The average maximum daily temperature in Nice in August is 28\u00a0\u00b0C., and the average minimum daily temperature in January is 6\u00a0\u00b0C.\nAlpes-de-Haute-Provence.\nThe department of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence has a Mediterranean climate in the lower valleys under one thousand metres in altitude and an alpine climate in the high valleys, such as the valleys of the Blanche, the Haut Verdon and the Ubaye, which are over 2500 metres high. The alpine climate in the higher mountains is moderated by the warmer air from the Mediterranean.\nHaute-Provence has unusually high summer temperatures for its altitude and latitude (44 degrees north). The average summer temperature is 22 to 23\u00a0\u00b0C. at an altitude of 400 metres, and 18 to 19\u00a0\u00b0C. at the altitude of 1000 metres; and the winter average temperature is 4 to 5\u00a0\u00b0C. at 400 metres and 0 C. at 1000 metres. The lower valleys have 50 days of freezing temperatures a year, more in the higher valleys. Sometimes the temperatures in the high valleys can reach \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C. Because of this combination of high mountains and Mediterranean air, it is not unusual that the region frequently has some of the lowest winter temperatures and some of the hottest summer temperatures in France.\nRainfall in Haute-Provence is infrequent \u2013 60 to 80 days a year \u2013 but can be torrential; 650 to 900\u00a0mm. a year in the foothills and plateaus of the southwest, and in the valley of the Ubaye; and 900 to 1500\u00a0mm. in the mountains. Most rainfall comes in the autumn, in brief and intense storms; from mid-June to mid-August, rain falls during brief but violent thunderstorms. Thunder can be heard 30 to 40 days a year.\nSnow falls in the mountains from November to May, and in midwinter can be found down to altitude of 1000\u20131200 metres on the shady side of the mountains and 1300 to 1600 metres on the sunny side. Snowfalls are usually fairly light, and melt rapidly.\nThe mistral, a wind blowing from the north and the northwest, is a feature of the climate in the western part of the department, bringing clear and dry weather. The eastern part of the department is more protected from the mistral. A southerly wind known as the marin brings warm air, clouds and rain.\nHaute-Provence is one of the sunniest regions of France, with an average of between 2,550 and 2,650 hours of sunshine annually in the north of the department, and 2,700 to 2,800 hours in the southwest. The clear nights and sunny days cause a sharp difference between nighttime and daytime temperatures. Because of the clear nights, the region is home of important observatories, such as the Observatory of Haute-Provence in Saint-Michel-Observatoire near Forcalquier.\nVaucluse.\nVaucluse is the meeting point of three of the four different climatic zones of France; it has a Mediterranean climate in the south, an alpine climate in the northeast, around the mountains of Vaucluse and the massif of the Baronnies; and a continental climate in the northwest. The close proximity of these three different climates tends to moderate all of them, and the Mediterranean climate usually prevails.\nOrange in the Vaucluse has 2595 hours of sunshine a year. It rains an average of 80 days a year, for a total of 693.4\u00a0mm a year. The maximum average temperature in July is 29.6\u00a0\u00b0C., and the average minimum temperature in January is 1.3\u00a0\u00b0C. There are an average of 110 days of strong winds a year.\nCulture.\nArt.\nArtists have been painting in Provence since prehistoric times; paintings of bisons, seals, auks and horses dating to between 27,000 and 19,000 BC were found in the Cosquer Cave near Marseille.\nThe 14th-century wooden ceiling of the cloister of Fr\u00e9jus Cathedral has a remarkable series of paintings of biblical scenes, fantastic animals, and scenes from daily life, painted between 1350 and 1360. They include paintings of a fallen angel with the wings of a bat, a demon with the tail of a serpent, angels playing instruments, a tiger, an elephant, an ostrich, domestic and wild animals, a mermaid, a dragon, a centaur, a butcher, a knight, and a juggler.\nNicolas Froment (1435\u20131486) was the most important painter of Provence during the Renaissance, best known for his triptych of the Burning Bush (c. 1476), commissioned by King Ren\u00e9 I of Naples. The painting shows a combination of Moses, the Burning Bush, and the Virgin Mary \"who gave birth but remained a virgin\", just as the bush of Moses \"-burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed\". This is the explication according to a plaque in the cathedral. A more likely reason for the juxtaposition is that in 1400 a shepherd, or shepherds, discovered a miraculous statue of the Virgin and Child inside another burning bush (thorn bush specifically), in the village of L'Epine in the present day department of La Marne. The site and statue were later visited by the \"Bon Roi Ren\u00e9\".\nThe wings of the triptych show King Ren\u00e9 with Mary Magdalene, St. Anthony and St. Maurice on one side, and Queen Jeanne de Laval, with Saint Catherine, John the Evangelist, and Saint Nicholas on the other.\nLouis Br\u00e9a (1450\u20131523) was a 15th-century painter, born in Nice, whose work is found in churches from Genoa to Antibes. His \"Retable of Saint-Nicholas\" (1500) is found in Monaco, and his \"Retable de Notre-Dame-de-Rosaire\" (1515) is found in Antibes.\nPierre Paul Puget (1620\u20131694), born in Marseille, was a painter of portraits and religious scenes, but was better known for his sculptures, found in Toulon Cathedral, outside the H\u00f4tel de Ville of Toulon, and in the Louvre. There is a mountain named for him near Marseille, and a square in Toulon.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, many of the most famous painters in the world converged on Provence, drawn by the climate and the clarity of the light. The special quality of the light is partly a result of the Mistral (wind), which removes dust from the atmosphere, greatly increasing visibility.\n\"Source and Bibliography about artists on the Mediterranean\"\nLiterature.\nHistorically, the language spoken in Provence was Proven\u00e7al, a dialect of the Occitan language, also known as langue d'oc, and closely related to Catalan. There are several regional variations: vivaro-alpin, spoken in the Alps, and the Proven\u00e7al variations of south, including the maritime, the rhoadanien (in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley) and the Ni\u00e7ois (in Nice). Ni\u00e7ois is the archaic form of Proven\u00e7al closest to the original language of the troubadours, and is sometimes to said to be literary language of its own.\nProven\u00e7al was widely spoken in Provence until the beginning of the 20th century, when the French government launched an intensive and largely successful effort to replace regional languages with French. Today, Proven\u00e7al is taught in schools and universities in the region, but is spoken regularly by a small number of people, probably less than 500,000, mostly elderly.\nThe golden age of Proven\u00e7al literature, more correctly called Occitan literature, was the 11th century and the 12th century, when the troubadours broke away from classical Latin literature and composed romances and love songs in their own vernacular language. Among the most famous troubadours was Folquet de Marselha, whose love songs became famous all over Europe, and who was praised by Dante in his \"Divine Comedy\". In his later years, Folquet gave up poetry to become the Abbot of Thoronet Abbey, and then Bishop of Toulouse, where he fiercely persecuted the Cathars.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, there was a literary movement to revive the language, called the F\u00e9librige, led by the poet Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral (1830\u20131914), who shared the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1904.\nProven\u00e7al writers and poets who wrote in Occitan include:\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the climate and lifestyle of Provence attracted writers almost as much as it attracted painters. It was particularly popular among British, American and Russian writers in the 1920s and 1930s.\nOther English-speaking writers who live in or have written about Provence include:\nMusic.\nMusic written about Provence includes:\nCinema.\nProvence has a special place in the history of the motion picture \u2013 one of the first projected motion pictures, \"L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat\" (\"The Arrival of a Train into La Ciotat Station\"), a fifty-second silent film, was made by Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re at the train station of the coastal town of La Ciotat. It was shown to an audience in Paris on 28 December 1895, causing a sensation.\nBefore its commercial premiere in Paris, the film was shown to invited audiences in several French cities, including La Ciotat. It was shown at the Eden Theater in September 1895, making that theatre one of the first motion picture theatres, and the only of the first theatres still showing movies in 2009.\nThree other of the earliest Lumiere films, \"Partie de cartes\", \"l'Arroseur arros\u00e9\" (the first known filmed comedy), and \"Repas de b\u00e9b\u00e9\", were also filmed in La Ciotat in 1895, at the Villa du Clos des Plages, the summer residence of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers.\nCuisine.\nThe cuisine of Provence is the result of the warm, dry Mediterranean climate; the rugged landscape, good for grazing sheep and goats but, outside of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, poor soil for large-scale agriculture; and the abundant seafood on the coast.\nThe basic ingredients are olives and olive oil, garlic, sardines, rockfish, sea urchins and octopus, lamb and goat, chickpeas, and local fruits, such as grapes, peaches, apricots, strawberries, cherries, and the famous melons of Cavaillon.\nThe fish frequently found on menus in Provence are the \"rouget\", a small red fish usually eaten grilled, and the \"loup\" (known elsewhere in France as the \"bar\"), often grilled with fennel over the wood of grapevines.\nWines.\nThe wines of Provence were probably introduced into Provence around 600 BC by the Greek Phoceans who founded Marseille and Nice. After the Roman occupation, in 120 BC the Roman Senate forbade the growing of vines and olives in Provence, to protect the profitable trade in exporting Italian wines, but in the late Roman empire retired soldiers from Roman Legions settled in Provence and were allowed to grow grapes.\nThe Romans complained about the competition from and poor quality of the wines of Provence. In the 1st century AD the Roman poet Martial condemned the wines of Marseille as \"terrible poisons, and never sold at a good price.\"\nAs recently as the 1970s the wines of Provence had the reputation of being rather ordinary: In 1971 wine critic Hugh Johnson wrote: \"The whites are dry and can lack the acidity to be refreshing; the reds are straightforward, strong and a trifle dull; it is usually the ros\u00e9s, often orange-tinted, which have most appeal.\" He added, \"Cassis and Bandol distinguish themselves for their white and red wines respectively. Cassis (no relation of the blackcurrant syrup) is livelier than the run of Proven\u00e7al white wine, and Bandol leads the red in much the same way.\"\nSince that time, cultivation of poorer varieties has been reduced and new technologies and methods have improved the quality considerably.\nThe wines of Provence are grown under demanding conditions; hot weather and abundant sunshine (Toulon, near Bandol, has the most sunshine of any city in France) which ripens the grapes quickly; little rain, and the mistral.\nThe great majority of the wines produced in Provence are ros\u00e9s. The most characteristic grape is mourv\u00e8dre, used most famously in the red wines of Bandol. Cassis is the only area in Provence known for its white wines.\nThere are three regional classifications (Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC)) in Provence:\nIn addition, there are five local classifications (\"Les appellations locales\"):\nSouth of Avignon, it occupies the north and south slopes of the Alpilles, up to an altitude of , and extends about thirty kilometres from east to west. The principal grapes for the red wines are grenache, mourv\u00e8dre, and syrah. For the ros\u00e9s, the main grapes are syrah and cinsault.\nPastis.\nPastis is the traditional liqueur of Provence, flavoured with anise and typically containing 40\u201345% alcohol by volume. When absinthe was banned in France in 1915, the major absinthe producers (then Pernod Fils and Ricard, who have since merged as Pernod Ricard) reformulated their drink without the banned wormwood and with more aniseed flavour, coming from star anise, sugar and a lower alcohol content, creating pastis. It is usually drunk diluted with water, which it turns a cloudy color. It is especially popular in and around Marseille.\nSports.\nP\u00e9tanque, a form of boules, is a popular sport played in towns and villages all over Provence.\nA more athletic version of the sport called \"jeu proven\u00e7al\" was popular throughout Provence in the 19th century \u2013 this version is featured in the novels and memoires of Marcel Pagnol; players ran three steps before throwing the ball, and it resembled at times a form of ballet. The modern version of the game was created in 1907 at the town of La Ciotat by a former champion of \"jeu proven\u00e7al \"named Jules Hugues, who was unable to play because of his rheumatism. He devised a new set of rules where the field was much smaller, and players did not run before throwing the ball, but remained inside a small circle with their feet together. This gave the game its name, \"lei peds tancats\", in the Proven\u00e7al dialect of Occitan, 'feet together'. The first tournament was played in La Ciotat in 1910. The first steel boules were introduced in 1927.\nThe object is to throw a ball (boule) as close as possible to a smaller ball, called the cochonnet, (this kind of throw is called to \"faire le point\" or \"pointer\"); or to knock away a boules of the opponent that is close to the cochonnet (this is called to \"tirer\"). Players compete one-on-one (\"t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate\"), in teams of two (\"doublettes\") or teams of three (\"triplettes\"). The object is to accumulate thirteen points. The point belongs to the ball the closest to the cochonnet. A player pitches balls until he can regain the point (\"reprenne le point\") by having his ball closest to the cochonnet. Each ball from a single team, if there are no other balls from the other team closer to the cochonnet, counts as a point. The points are counted when all of the balls have been tossed by both teams.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It may instead be known as a tellurian planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets accepted by the International Astronomical Union are the inner planets closest to the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Among astronomers who use the geophysical definition of a planet, two or three planetary-mass satellites \u2013 Earth's Moon, Io, and sometimes Europa \u2013 may also be considered terrestrial planets. The large rocky asteroids Pallas and Vesta are sometimes included as well, albeit rarely. The terms \"terrestrial planet\" and \"telluric planet\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\"Terra\" and \"Tellus\"), as these planets are, in terms of structure, \"Earth-like\". Terrestrial planets are generally studied by geologists, astronomers, and geophysicists.\nTerrestrial planets have a solid planetary surface, making them substantially different from larger gaseous planets, which are composed mostly of some combination of hydrogen, helium, and water existing in various physical states.\nStructure.\nAll terrestrial planets in the Solar System have the same basic structure, such as a central metallic core (mostly iron) with a surrounding silicate mantle.\nThe large rocky asteroid 4 Vesta has a similar structure; possibly so does the smaller one 21 Lutetia. Another rocky asteroid 2 Pallas is about the same size as Vesta, but is significantly less dense; it appears to have never differentiated a core and a mantle. The Earth's Moon and Jupiter's moon Io have similar structures to terrestrial planets, but Earth's Moon has a much smaller iron core. Another Jovian moon Europa has a similar density but has a significant ice layer on the surface: for this reason, it is sometimes considered an icy planet instead.\nTerrestrial planets can have surface structures such as canyons, craters, mountains, volcanoes, and others, depending on the presence at any time of an erosive liquid or tectonic activity or both.\nTerrestrial planets have secondary atmospheres, generated by volcanic out-gassing or from comet impact debris. This contrasts with the outer, giant planets, whose atmospheres are primary; primary atmospheres were captured directly from the original solar nebula.\nTerrestrial planets within the Solar System.\nThe Solar System has four terrestrial planets under the dynamical definition: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. The Earth's Moon as well as Jupiter's moons Io and Europa would also count geophysically, as well as perhaps the large protoplanet-asteroids Pallas and Vesta (though those are borderline cases). Among these bodies, only the Earth has an active surface hydrosphere. Europa is believed to have an active hydrosphere under its ice layer.\nDuring the formation of the Solar System, there were many terrestrial planetesimals and proto-planets, but most merged with or were ejected by the four terrestrial planets, leaving only Pallas and Vesta to survive more or less intact. These two were likely both dwarf planets in the past, but have been battered out of equilibrium shapes by impacts. Some other protoplanets began to accrete and differentiate but suffered catastrophic collisions that left only a metallic or rocky core, like 16 Psyche or 8 Flora respectively. Many S-type and M-type asteroids may be such fragments.\nThe other round bodies from the asteroid belt outward are geophysically \"icy planets\". They are similar to terrestrial planets in that they have a solid surface, but are composed of ice and rock rather than of rock and metal. These include the dwarf planets, such as Ceres, Pluto and Eris, which are found today only in the regions beyond the formation snow line where water ice was stable under direct sunlight in the early Solar System. It also includes the other round moons, which are ice-rock (e.g. Ganymede, Callisto, Titan, and Triton) or even almost pure (at least 99%) ice (Tethys and Iapetus). Some of these bodies are known to have subsurface hydrospheres (Ganymede, Callisto, Enceladus, and Titan), like Europa, and it is also possible for some others (e.g. Ceres, Mimas, Dione, Miranda, Ariel, Triton, and Pluto). Titan even has surface bodies of liquid, albeit liquid methane rather than water. Jupiter's Ganymede, though icy, does have a metallic core like the Moon, Io, Europa, and the terrestrial planets.\nThe name \"Terran\" world has been suggested to define all solid worlds (bodies assuming a rounded shape), without regard to their composition. It would thus include both terrestrial and icy planets.\nDensity trends.\nThe uncompressed density of a terrestrial planet is the average density its materials would have at zero pressure. A greater uncompressed density indicates a greater metal content. Uncompressed density differs from the true average density (also often called \"bulk\" density) because compression within planet cores increases their density; the average density depends on planet size, temperature distribution, and material stiffness as well as composition.\nCalculations to estimate uncompressed density inherently require a model of the planet's structure. Where there have been landers or multiple orbiting spacecraft, these models are constrained by seismological data and also moment of inertia data derived from the spacecraft's orbits. Where such data is not available, uncertainties are inevitably higher.\nThe uncompressed densities of the rounded terrestrial bodies directly orbiting the Sun trend towards lower values as the distance from the Sun increases, consistent with the temperature gradient that would have existed within the primordial solar nebula. The Galilean satellites show a similar trend going outwards from Jupiter; however, no such trend is observable for the icy satellites of Saturn or Uranus. The icy worlds typically have densities less than 2 g\u00b7cm\u22123. Eris is significantly denser (), and may be mostly rocky with some surface ice, like Europa. It is unknown whether extrasolar terrestrial planets in general will follow such a trend.\nThe data in the tables below are mostly taken from a list of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System and planetary-mass moon. All distances from the Sun are averages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExtrasolar terrestrial planets.\nMost of the planets discovered outside the Solar System are giant planets, because they are more easily detectable. But since 2005, hundreds of potentially terrestrial extrasolar planets have also been found, with several being confirmed as terrestrial. Most of these are super-Earths, i.e. planets with masses between Earth's and Neptune's; super-Earths may be gas planets or terrestrial, depending on their mass and other parameters.\nDuring the early 1990s, the first extrasolar planets were discovered orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12, with masses of 0.02, 4.3, and 3.9 times that of Earth, by pulsar timing.\nWhen 51 Pegasi b, the first planet found around a star still undergoing fusion, was discovered, many astronomers assumed it to be a gigantic terrestrial, because it was assumed no gas giant could exist as close to its star (0.052\u00a0AU) as 51\u00a0Pegasi\u00a0b did. It was later found to be a gas giant.\nIn 2005, the first planets orbiting a main-sequence star and which showed signs of being terrestrial planets were found: Gliese 876 d and OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb. Gliese 876\u00a0d orbits the red dwarf Gliese 876, 15 light years from Earth, and has a mass seven to nine\u00a0times that of Earth and an orbital period of just two Earth days. OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb has about 5.5\u00a0times the mass of Earth and orbits a star about 21,000 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius.\nFrom 2007 to 2010, three (possibly four) potential terrestrial planets were found orbiting within the Gliese 581 planetary system. The smallest, Gliese 581e, is only about 1.9 Earth masses, but orbits very close to the star. Two others, Gliese 581c and the disputed Gliese\u00a0581d, are more-massive super-Earths orbiting in or close to the habitable zone of the star, so they could potentially be habitable, with Earth-like temperatures.\nAnother possibly terrestrial planet, HD 85512 b, was discovered in 2011; it has at least 3.6 times the mass of Earth.\nThe radius and composition of all these planets are unknown.\nThe first confirmed terrestrial exoplanet, Kepler-10b, was found in 2011 by the Kepler space telescope, specifically designed to discover Earth-size planets around other stars using the transit method.\nIn the same year, the Kepler space telescope mission team released a list of 1235 extrasolar planet candidates, including six that are \"Earth-size\" or \"super-Earth-size\" (i.e. they have a radius less than twice that of the Earth) and in the habitable zone of their star.\nSince then, Kepler has discovered hundreds of planets ranging from Moon-sized to super-Earths, with many more candidates in this size range (see image).\nIn 2016, statistical modeling of the relationship between a planet's mass and radius using a broken power law appeared to suggest that the transition point between rocky, terrestrial worlds and mini-Neptunes without a defined surface was in fact very close to Earth and Venus's, suggesting that rocky worlds much larger than our own are in fact quite rare. This resulted in some advocating for the retirement of the term \"super-earth\" as being scientifically misleading. Since 2016 the catalog of known exoplanets has increased significantly, and there have been several published refinements of the mass-radius model. As of 2024, the expected transition point between rocky and intermediate-mass planets sits at roughly 4.4 earth masses, and roughly 1.6 earth radii.\nIn September 2020, astronomers using microlensing techniques reported the detection, for the first time, of an Earth-mass rogue planet (named OGLE-2016-BLG-1928) unbounded by any star, and free-floating in the Milky Way galaxy.\nList of terrestrial exoplanets.\nThe following exoplanets have a density of at least and a mass below Neptune's and are thus very likely terrestrial:\nKepler-10b, Kepler-20b, Kepler-36b, Kepler-48d, Kepler 68c, Kepler-78b, Kepler-89b, Kepler-93b, Kepler-97b, Kepler-99b, Kepler-100b, Kepler-101c, Kepler-102b, Kepler-102d, Kepler-113b, Kepler-131b, Kepler-131c, Kepler-138c, Kepler-406b, Kepler-406c, Kepler-409b.\nFrequency.\nIn 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth- and super-Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way. Eleven billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars. The nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away, according to the scientists. However, this does not give estimates for the number of extrasolar terrestrial planets, because there are planets as small as Earth that have been shown to be gas planets (see Kepler-138d).\nEstimates show that about 80% of potentially habitable worlds are covered by land, and about 20% are ocean planets. Planets with ratios more like those of Earth, which was 30% land and 70% ocean, only make up 1% of these worlds.\nTypes.\nSeveral possible classifications for solid planets have been proposed.\n A solid planet like Venus, Earth, or Mars, made primarily of a silicon-based rocky mantle with a metallic (iron) core.\n A theoretical class of planets, composed of a metal core surrounded by primarily carbon-based minerals. They may be considered a type of terrestrial planet if the metal content dominates. The Solar System contains no carbon planets but does have carbonaceous asteroids, such as Ceres and Hygiea. It is unknown if Ceres has a rocky or metallic core.\n A theoretical type of solid planet that consists almost entirely of iron and therefore has a greater density and a smaller radius than other solid planets of comparable mass. Mercury in the Solar System has a metallic core equal to 60\u201370% of its planetary mass, and is sometimes called an iron planet, though its surface is made of silicates and is iron-poor. Iron planets are thought to form in the high-temperature regions close to a star, like Mercury, and if the protoplanetary disk is rich in iron.\n A type of solid planet with an icy surface of volatiles. In the Solar System, most planetary-mass moons (such as Titan, Triton, and Enceladus) and many dwarf planets (such as Pluto and Eris) have such a composition. Europa is sometimes considered an icy planet due to its surface ice, but its higher density indicates that its interior is mostly rocky. Such planets can have internal saltwater oceans and cryovolcanoes erupting liquid water (i.e. an internal hydrosphere, like Europa or Enceladus); they can have an atmosphere and hydrosphere made from methane or nitrogen (like Titan). A metallic core is possible, as exists on Ganymede.\n A theoretical type of solid planet that consists of silicate rock but has no metallic core, i.e. the opposite of an iron planet. Although the Solar System contains no coreless planets, chondrite asteroids and meteorites are common in the Solar System. Ceres and Pallas have mineral compositions similar to carbonaceous chondrites, though Pallas is significantly less hydrated. Coreless planets are thought to form farther from the star where volatile oxidizing material is more common."}

As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 8,728. The county seat is Pinedale. It is a sparsely populated rural county in western Wyoming, along the Green River.\nHistory.\nSublette County was created February 15, 1921, of land partitioned from Fremont and Lincoln counties. Its governing organization was completed by 1923. Before settlement, the western Wyoming mountains were traversed and harvested by fur trappers and traders. Sublette County is named for one of those early characters, William Lewis Sublette. Today the county celebrates its fur trade heritage with the Museum of the Mountain Man in Pinedale. In the early 1900s the majority of the population in what is today Sublette County were first generation immigrants from England and Germany. A majority of the population in Sublette County supported America's entry into World War I and at the time the county was known for its \"pro-British\" sentiments. The German immigrants in the county were not anti-British, and most of them were outspoken about England being their favorite foreign country other than Germany, however they did support neutrality and want America to stay out of the war. Even during the war, relations between first generation English immigrants and first generation German immigrants were known for being exceptionally cordial (Sublette County, Wyoming stood out in this regard because this was not the norm nation-wide).\nGeography.\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water.\nNational protected areas.\nAt present, Bridger National Forest and Teton National Forest are administratively combined into the Bridger-Teton National Forest. Sublette County contains portions of both original forests.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 census, the county had a population of 8,728. Of the residents, 24.3% were under the age of 18 and 18.6% were 65 years of age or older; the median age was 41.5 years. For every 100 females there were 111.6 males, and for every 100 females age 18 and over there were 108.4 males.\nThe racial makeup of the county was 89.2% White, 0.2% Black or African American, 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.6% Asian, 3.3% from some other race, and 6.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race comprised 7.3% of the population.\nThere were 3,606 households in the county, of which 29.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them and 16.1% had a female householder with no spouse or partner present. About 27.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.\nThere were 5,167 housing units, of which 30.2% were vacant. Among occupied housing units, 73.8% were owner-occupied and 26.2% were renter-occupied. The homeowner vacancy rate was 3.1% and the rental vacancy rate was 18.3%.\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 10,247\u00a0people, 3,906\u00a0households, and 2,594\u00a0families in the county. The population density was . There were 5,770 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 93.2% white, 0.8% American Indian, 0.5% Asian, 0.3% black or African American, 3.7% from other races, and 1.4% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 6.9% of the population. In terms of ancestry, 31.8% were German, 22.0% were English, 11.3% were Irish, 6.3% were American, and 5.1% were Scottish.\nOf the 3,906\u00a0households, 32.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.3% were married couples living together, 5.1% had a female householder with no husband present, 33.6% were non-families, and 25.6% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 2.48 and the average family size was 2.99. The median age was 38.3 years.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $70,147 and the median income for a family was $81,389. Males had a median income of $51,125 versus $31,940 for females. The per capita income for the county was $31,433. About 2.7% of families and 4.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.2% of those under age 18 and 1.1% of those age 65 or over.\nGovernment and politics.\nLike most of Wyoming, Sublette County is overwhelmingly Republican. Since it was created in 1921, the solitary Democrat to carry the county was Franklin D. Roosevelt, who won a majority against Herbert Hoover in 1932 and a twenty-nine vote plurality against Alf Landon four years later. Since 1968 no Democrat has reached twenty-nine percent of Sublette County's ballots, and the only occasions a Republican has failed to pass seventy percent were when Ross Perot took substantial numbers of votes in 1992 and 1996.\nSublette County is managed by a county commission with three members. In 2011, Sublette County residents petitioned voters to approve an increase in this number to five as allowed under Wyoming law. The ballot initiative passed and five commissioners were to be seated during the 2012 election cycle.\nIn early 2012, another ballot initiative was presented to voters requesting their approval to decrease the number of county commissioners back to three even before seating the two additional commissioners. This second special election, held on May 8, 2012, returned the commission to its previous number of three.\nEducation.\nSchool districts include Sublette County School District 1 and Sublette County School District 9.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48517", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48517", "title": "Antelope", "text": "Term referring to an even-toed ruminant\nThe term antelope refers to numerous extant or recently extinct species of the ruminant artiodactyl family Bovidae that are indigenous to most of Africa, India, the Middle East, Central Asia, and a small area of Russia. Antelopes do not form a monophyletic group, as some antelopes are more closely related to other bovid groups, such as bovines, goats, and sheep, than to other antelopes. \nA stricter grouping, known as the true antelopes, includes only the genera \"Gazella\", \"Nanger\", \"Eudorcas\", and \"Antilope\". One North American mammal, the pronghorn or \"pronghorn antelope\", is colloquially referred to as the \"American antelope\", despite the fact that it belongs to a completely different family (Antilocapridae) than the true Old-World antelopes; pronghorn are the sole extant member of a lineage that once included many species which went extinct in the prehistoric period.\nAlthough antelopes are sometimes misidentified as \"deer\" (cervids), the groups are only distantly related. While antelopes are found in abundance in Africa, there is only one living African deer species: the Barbary stag of North Africa. By comparison, numerous deer species are found in regions of the world with few or no antelope species present, such as throughout Southeast Asia, Europe and all of the Americas. This is likely due to competition over shared resources, as deer and antelope fill a virtually identical ecological niche in their respective habitats. Countries like India, however, have large populations of endemic deer and antelope, with the different species generally keeping to their own \"niches\" with minimal overlap.\nUnlike deer, in which males of most species sport antlers that are shed and regrown annually, antelope horns are bone and grow steadily, never falling off. If a horn is broken, it will either remain broken or take years to partially regenerate, depending on the species.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"antelope\" first appeared in 1417 and is derived from the Old French \"antelop\", itself derived from Medieval Latin \"ant(h)alopus\", which in turn comes from the Byzantine Greek word \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c8, \"anth\u00f3lops\", first attested in Eustathius of Antioch (c.\u2009336), according to whom it was a fabulous animal \"haunting the banks of the Euphrates, very savage, hard to catch and having long, saw-like horns capable of cutting down trees\". It perhaps derives from Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, \"anthos\" (flower) and \u03ce\u03c8, \"ops\" (eye), perhaps meaning \"beautiful eye\" or alluding to the animals' long eyelashes. This, however, may be a folk etymology in Greek based on some earlier root. The word \"talopus\" and \"calopus\", from Latin, came to be used in heraldry. In 1607, it was first used for living, cervine animals.\nSpecies.\nThere are 91 antelope species, most of which are native to Africa, in about 30 genera. The classification of tribes or subfamilies within Bovoidea is still a matter of debate, with several alternative systems proposed.\nAntelope are not a cladistic or taxonomically defined group. The term is used to describe all members of the family Bovidae that do not fall under the category of sheep, cattle, or goats. Usually, all species of the Antilopinae, Hippotraginae, Reduncinae, Cephalophinae, many Bovinae, the grey rhebok, and the impala are called antelope.\nDistribution and habitat.\nMore species of antelope are native to Africa than to any other continent, almost exclusively in savannahs, with 25-40 species co-occurring over much of East Africa. Because savannah habitat in Africa has expanded and contracted five times over the last three million years, and the fossil record indicates this is when most extant species evolved, it is believed that isolation in refugia during contractions was a major driver of this diversification. Other species occur in Asia: the Arabian Peninsula is home to the Arabian oryx and Dorcas gazelle. South Asia is home to the nilgai, chinkara, blackbuck, Tibetan antelope, and four-horned antelope, while Russia and Central Asia have the Tibetan antelope and saiga.\nNo antelope species is native to Australasia or Antarctica, nor do any extant species occur in the Americas, though the nominate saiga subspecies occurred in North America during the Pleistocene. North America is currently home to the native pronghorn, which taxonomists do not consider a member of the antelope group, but which is often locally referred to as such (e.g., \"American antelope\"). In Europe, several extinct species occur in the fossil record, and the saiga was found widely during the Pleistocene but did not persist into the later Holocene, except in Russian Kalmykia and Astrakhan Oblast.\nMany species of antelope have been imported to other parts of the world, especially the United States, for exotic game hunting. With some species possessing spectacular leaping and evasive skills, individuals may escape. Texas in particular has many game ranches, as well as habitats and climates that are very hospitable to African and Asian plains antelope species. Accordingly, wild populations of blackbuck antelope, gemsbok, and nilgai may be found in Texas.\nAntelope live in a wide range of habitats. Most live in the African savannahs. However, many species are more secluded, such as the forest antelope, as well as the extreme cold-living saiga, the desert-adapted Arabian oryx, the rocky koppie-living klipspringer, and semiaquatic sitatunga.\nSpecies living in forests, woodland, or bush tend to be sedentary, but many of the plains species undertake long migrations. These enable grass-eating species to follow the rains and thereby their food supply. The gnus and gazelles of East Africa perform some of the most impressive mass migratory circuits of all mammals.\nMorphology.\nBody and covering.\nAntelope vary greatly in size. For example, a male common eland can measure at the shoulder and weigh almost , whereas an adult royal antelope may stand only at the shoulder and weigh a mere .\nNot surprisingly for animals with long, slender yet powerful legs, many antelope have long strides and can run fast. Some (e.g. klipspringer) are also adapted to inhabiting rock koppies and crags. Both dibatags and gerenuks habitually stand on their two hind legs to reach acacia and other tree foliage. Different antelope have different body types, which can affect movement. Duikers are short, bush-dwelling antelope that can pick through dense foliage and dive into the shadows rapidly. Gazelle and springbok are known for their speed and leaping abilities. Even larger antelope, such as nilgai, elands, and kudus, are capable of jumping or greater, although their running speed is restricted by their greater mass.\nAntelope have a wide variety of coverings, though most have a dense coat of short fur. In most species, the coat (pelage) is some variation of a brown colour (or several shades of brown), often with white or pale underbodies. Exceptions include the zebra-marked zebra duiker, the grey, black, and white Jentink's duiker, and the black lechwe. Most of the \"spiral-horned\" antelope have pale, vertical stripes on their backs. Many desert and semidesert species are particularly pale, some almost silvery or whitish (e.g. Arabian oryx); the beisa and southern oryxes have gray and black pelages with vivid black-and-white faces. Common features of various gazelles are white rumps, which flash a warning to others when they run from danger, and dark stripes midbody (the latter feature is also shared by the springbok and beira). The springbok also has a pouch of white, brushlike hairs running along its back, which opens up when the animal senses danger, causing the dorsal hairs to stand on end.\nMany antelope are sexually dimorphic. In most species, both sexes have horns, but those of males tend to be larger. Males tend to be larger than the females, but exceptions in which the females tend to be heavier than the males include the bush duiker, dwarf antelope, Cape grysbok, and oribi, all rather small species. A number of species have hornless females (e.g., sitatunga, red lechwe, and suni). In some species, the males and females have differently coloured pelages (e.g. blackbuck and nyala). \nMany wild antelopes are characterized by high running and jumping abilities. Their main defence against predators is to try to escape. \nSpecies such as black wildebeest, springbok, blesbok, mountain reedbuck, greater kudu as well the European fallow deer have a high concentrations of glycolitic fast twitch type IIx muscle fibers; smaller species naturally have a higher concentrations of type IIx fibers than larger species. Although their concentration of type IIx fibers is still lower than that of the wild cheetah, other running-adapted mammal; wild cheetah vastus lateralis muscle have a concentration of 76 % of type IIx fibers, compared to 58 % of springbok, 57 % of mountain reedbuck, 55 % of blesbok, 48 % of European fallow deer, 43 % of greater kudu and 30 % black wildebeest.\nThe activity of the anaerobic enzyme LDH, an indicator of a principally anaerobic muscle metabolism, is around 4 times more higher than that of humans, a level of activity comparable to that of the lion, but lower than that of the wild caracal and especially that of the wild cheetah; LDH activity is 6 times higher than that of the humans in caracal and 9 times higher in the wild cheetah. \nActivity of aerobic enzymes CS and 3HAD is higher than that of the felids in general and is comparable to that of human endurance runners. This indicates muscles capable of both high speed and high endurance. \nImpala muscles, on the other hand, have a high concentrations of oxidative-glycolitic fast twitch type IIa muscle fibers. \nBoth impala and reindeer have a CS level activity comparable to that of the human endurance runners and their muscle metabolism appears to be principally aerobic, indicating muscles capable of high endurance. \nIn the impala, hindlimbs muscles form 17.5 % of their body mass while forelimbs muscles form 11.3 %. Compared to the reindeer in which hind and forelimb muscles form 14.8 % and 10.9 % of their body mass, respectively. \nFurthermore, antelopes tend to have elongated limb bones for their body masses. \nA maximum running speed of 63.7 km/h for the impala and 54 km/h for the blue wildebeest has been estimated by GPS-IMU collars. A top speed of 65.2 km/h is obtained by calculating the distance and time it takes a Thomson's gazelle to escape from an approaching human. Film analysis of lion hunts gives a maximum speed of 90 km/h for the Thomson's gazelle. By speedometer reading when an animal runs alongside a car on a straight course, a maximum speed of up to 70 km/h has been estimated for the eland and the topi, and up to 80 km/h for the hartebeest, blue wildebeest, Grant's gazelle and Thomson's gazelle. \nRed forest duikers can jump cleanly over fences 1.6 m high, an impressive feat considering their shoulder height of 30 cm. Impalas can jump highs of 2.4 m (8 ft). \nFemale Thomson's gazelles have been reported to be faster and more agile than males. This is in line with the fact that female springboks, another antilopine, have higher concentrations of type IIx fibres and probably also a higher amount of muscle glycogen than males. \nSensory and digestive systems.\nAntelope are ruminants, so they have well-developed molar teeth, which grind cud (food balls stored in the stomach) into a pulp for further digestion. They have no upper incisors, but rather a hard upper gum pad, against which their lower incisors bite to tear grass stems and leaves.\nLike many other herbivores, antelope rely on keen senses to avoid predators. Their eyes are placed on the sides of their heads, giving them a broad radius of vision with minimal binocular vision. Their horizontally elongated pupils also help in this respect. Acute senses of smell and hearing give antelope the ability to perceive danger at night out in the open (when predators are often on the prowl). These same senses play an important role in contact between individuals of the same species; markings on their heads, ears, legs, and rumps are used in such communication. Many species \"flash\" such markings, as well as their tails; vocal communications include loud barks, whistles, \"moos\", and trumpeting; many species also use scent marking to define their territories or simply to maintain contact with their relatives and neighbors.\nAntelope horns.\nThe size and shape of antelope horns varies greatly. Those of the duikers and dwarf antelope tend to be simple \"spikes\", but differ in the angle to the head from backward curved and backward pointing (e.g. yellow-backed duiker) to straight and upright (e.g. steenbok). Other groups have twisted (e.g. common eland), spiral (e.g. greater kudu), \"recurved\" (e.g. the reedbucks), lyrate (e.g. impala), or long, curved (e.g. the oryxes) horns. Horns are not shed and their bony cores are covered with a thick, persistent sheath of horny material, both of which distinguish them from antlers.\nAntelope horns are efficient weapons, and tend to be better developed in those species where males fight over females (large herd antelope) than in solitary or lekking species. With male-male competition for mates, horns are clashed in combat. Males more commonly use their horns against each other than against another species. The boss of the horns is typically arranged in such a way that two antelope striking at each other's horns cannot crack each other's skulls, making a fight via horn more ritualized than dangerous. Many species have ridges in their horns for at least two-thirds the length of their horns, but these ridges are not a direct indicator of age.\nBehavior.\nMating strategies.\nAntelope are often classified by their reproductive behavior.\nSmall antelope, such as dik-diks, tend to be monogamous. They live in a forest environment with patchy resources, and a male is unable to monopolize more than one female due to this sparse distribution. Larger forest species often form very small herds of two to four females and one male.\nSome species, such as lechwes, pursue a lek breeding system, where the males gather on a lekking ground and compete for a small territory, while the females appraise males and choose one with which to mate.\nLarge grazing antelope, such as impala or wildebeest, form large herds made up of many females and a single breeding male, which excludes all other males, often by combat.\nDefense.\nAntelope pursue a number of defense strategies, often dictated by their morphology.\nLarge antelope that gather in large herds, such as wildebeest, rely on numbers and running speed for protection. In some species, adults will encircle the offspring, protecting them from predators when threatened. Many forest antelope rely on cryptic coloring and good hearing to avoid predators. Forest antelope often have very large ears and dark or striped colorations. Small antelope, especially duikers, evade predation by jumping into dense bush where the predator cannot pursue. Springboks use a behavior known as stotting to confuse predators.\nOpen grassland species have nowhere to hide from predators, so they tend to be fast runners. They are agile and have good endurance\u2014these are advantages when pursued by sprint-dependent predators such as cheetahs, which are the fastest of land animals, but tire quickly. Reaction distances vary with predator species and behaviour. For example, gazelles may not flee from a lion until it is closer than 200\u00a0m (650\u00a0ft)\u2014lions hunt as a pride or by surprise, usually by stalking; one that can be seen clearly is unlikely to attack. However, sprint-dependent cheetahs will cause gazelles to flee at a range of over .\nIf escape is not an option, antelope are capable of fighting back. Oryxes in particular have been known to stand sideways like many unrelated bovids to appear larger than they are, and may charge at a predator as a last resort.\nStatus.\nAbout 25 species are rated by the IUCN as endangered, such as the dama gazelle and mountain nyala. A number of subspecies are also endangered, including the giant sable antelope and the mhorr gazelle. The main causes for concern for these species are habitat loss, competition with cattle for grazing, and trophy hunting.\nThe chiru or Tibetan antelope is hunted for its pelt, which is used in making \"shahtoosh\" wool, used in shawls. Since the fur can only be removed from dead animals, and each animal yields very little of the downy fur, several antelope must be killed to make a single shawl. This unsustainable demand has led to enormous declines in the chiru population.\nThe saiga is hunted for its horns, which are considered an aphrodisiac by some cultures. Only the males have horns, and have been so heavily hunted that some herds contain up to 800 females to one male. The species showed a steep decline and was formerly classified as critically endangered. However, the saigas have experienced a massive regrowth and are now classified as near threatened.\nLifespan.\nIt is difficult to determine how long antelope live in the wild. With the preference of predators towards old and infirm individuals, which can no longer sustain peak speeds, few wild prey-animals live as long as their biological potential. In captivity, wildebeest have lived beyond 20 years old, and impalas have reached their late teens.\nRelationship with humans.\nCulture.\nThe antelope's horn is prized for supposed medicinal and magical powers in many places. The horn of the male saiga, in Eastern practice, is ground as an aphrodisiac, for which it has been hunted nearly to extinction. In the Congo, it is thought to confine spirits. The antelope's ability to run swiftly has also led to their association with the wind, such as in the \"Rig Veda\", as the steeds of the Maruts and the wind god Vayu. There is, however, no scientific evidence that the horns of any antelope have any change on a human's physiology or characteristics.\nIn Mali, antelope were believed to have brought the skills of agriculture to mankind.\nDomestication.\nDomestication of animals requires certain traits in the animal that antelope do not typically display. Most species are difficult to contain in any density, due to the territoriality of the males, or in the case of oryxes (which have a relatively hierarchical social structure), an aggressive disposition; they can easily kill a human. Because many have extremely good jumping abilities, providing adequate fencing is a challenge. Also, antelope will consistently display a fear response to perceived predators, such as humans, making them very difficult to herd or handle. Although antelope have diets and rapid growth rates highly suitable for domestication, this tendency to panic and their non-hierarchical social structure explains why farm-raised antelope are uncommon. Ancient Egyptians kept herds of gazelles and addax for meat, and occasionally pets. It is unknown whether they were truly domesticated, but it seems unlikely, as no domesticated gazelles exist today.\nHowever, humans have had success taming certain species, such as the elands. These antelope sometimes jump over each other's backs when alarmed, but this incongruous talent seems to be exploited only by wild members of the species; tame elands do not take advantage of it and can be enclosed within a very low fence. Their meat, milk, and hides are all of excellent quality, and experimental eland husbandry has been going on for some years in both Ukraine and Zimbabwe. In both locations, the animal has proved wholly amenable to domestication. Similarly, European visitors to Arabia reported \"tame gazelles are very common in the Asiatic countries of which the species is a native; and the poetry of these countries abounds in allusions both to the beauty and the gentleness of the gazelle.\" Other antelope that have been tamed successfully include the gemsbok, the kudu, and the springbok.\nHybrid antelope.\nA wide variety of antelope hybrids have been recorded in zoos, game parks, and wildlife ranches, due to either a lack of more appropriate mates in enclosures shared with other species or a misidentification of species. The ease of hybridization shows how closely related some antelope species are. With few exceptions, most hybrid antelope occur only in captivity.\nMost hybrids occur between species within the same genus. All reported examples occur within the same subfamily. As with most mammal hybrids, the less closely related the parents, the more likely the offspring will be sterile.\nHeraldry.\nAntelope are a common symbol in heraldry, though they occur in a highly distorted form from nature. The heraldic antelope has the body of a stag and the tail of a lion, with serrated horns, and a small tusk at the end of its snout. This bizarre and inaccurate form was invented by European heralds in the Middle Ages, who knew little of foreign animals and made up the rest. The antelope was mistakenly imagined to be a monstrous beast of prey; the 16th century poet Edmund Spenser referred to it as being \"as fierce and fell as a wolf.\"\nAntelope can all also occur in their natural form, in which case they are termed \"natural antelope\" to distinguish them from the more usual heraldic antelope. The arms previously used by the Republic of South Africa featured a natural antelope, along with an oryx.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the largest university press in the world. Its first book was printed in Oxford in 1478, with the Press officially granted the legal right to print books by decree in 1586. It is the second-oldest university press after Cambridge University Press, which was founded in 1534.\nIt is a department of the University of Oxford. It is governed by a group of 15 academics, the Delegates of the Press, appointed by the vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford. The Delegates of the Press are led by the Secretary to the Delegates, who serves as OUP's chief executive and as its major representative on other university bodies. Oxford University Press has had a similar governance structure since the 17th century. The press is located on Walton Street, Oxford, opposite Somerville College, in the inner suburb of Jericho.\nFor the last 400 years, OUP has focused primarily on the publication of pedagogical texts. It continues this tradition today by publishing academic journals, dictionaries, English language resources, bibliographies, books on Indology, music, classics, literature, and history, as well as Bibles and atlases.\nOUP has offices around the world, primarily in locations that were once part of the British Empire.\nHistory.\nEarly origins (1480\u20131668).\nThe University of Oxford began printing around 1480 and became a major printer of Bibles, prayer books, and scholarly works. Oxford's chancellor Archbishop William Laud consolidated the legal status of the university's printing in the 1630s and petitioned Charles I for rights that would enable Oxford to compete with the Stationers' Company and the King's Printer. He obtained a succession of royal grants, and Oxford's \"Great Charter\" in 1636 gave the university the right to print \"all manner of books\". Laud also obtained the \"privilege\" from the Crown of printing the King James or Authorized Version of Scripture at Oxford. This privilege created substantial returns over the next 250 years.\nPrint shop establishment and expansion (1668\u20131830).\nFollowing the English Civil War, Vice-chancellor John Fell, Dean of Christ Church, Bishop of Oxford, and Secretary to the Delegates was determined to install printing presses in 1668, making it the university's first central print shop. In 1674, OUP began to print a broadsheet calendar, known as the \"Oxford Almanack,\" that was produced annually without interruption from 1674 to 2019. Fell drew up the first formal programme for the university's printing, which envisaged hundreds of works, including the Bible in Greek, editions of the Coptic Gospels and works of the Church Fathers, texts in Arabic and Syriac, comprehensive editions of classical philosophy, poetry, and mathematics, a wide range of medieval scholarship, and also \"a history of insects, more perfect than any yet Extant.\"\nGenerally speaking, the early 18th century marked a lull in the press's expansion. It suffered from the absence of any figure comparable to Fell. The business was rescued by the intervention of a single Delegate, William Blackstone. Disgusted by the chaotic state of the press and antagonized by Vice-Chancellor George Huddesford, Blackstone called for sweeping reforms that would firmly set out the Delegates' powers and obligations, officially record their deliberations and accounting, and put the print shop on an efficient footing. Nonetheless, Randolph ignored this document, and it was not until Blackstone threatened legal action that changes began. The university had moved to adopt all of Blackstone's reforms by 1760.\nBy the late 18th century, the press had become more focused. In 1825, the Delegates bought land on Walton Street. Buildings were constructed from plans drawn up by Daniel Robertson and Edward Blore, and the press moved into them in 1830. This site remains the principal office of OUP in the 21st century, at the corner of Walton Street and Great Clarendon Street, northwest of Oxford city centre.\nCommercial growth and scholarly publishing (1830\u20131870).\nThe press then entered an era of enormous change. In 1830, it was still a joint-stock printing business in an academic backwater, offering learned works to a relatively small readership of scholars and clerics At this time, Thomas Combe joined the press and became the university's Printer until he died in 1872. Combe was a better businessman than most Delegates but still no innovator: he failed to grasp the huge commercial potential of India paper, which grew into one of Oxford's most profitable trade secrets in later years. Even so, Combe earned a fortune through his shares in the business and the acquisition and renovation of the bankrupt paper mill at Wolvercote. Combe showed little interest, however, in producing fine printed work at the press. The best-known text associated with his print shop was the flawed first edition of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", printed by Oxford at the expense of its author Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in 1865.\nIt took the 1850 Royal Commission on the workings of the university and a new Secretary, Bartholomew Price, to shake up the press. Appointed in 1868, Price had already recommended to the university that the press needed an efficient executive officer to exercise \"vigilant superintendence\" of the business, including its dealings with Alexander Macmillan, who became the publisher for Oxford's printing in 1863 and 1866 helped Price to create the Clarendon Press series of cheap, elementary school books\u00a0\u2013 perhaps the first time that Oxford used the Clarendon imprint. Under Price, the press began to take on its modern shape. Major new lines of work began. For example, in 1875, the Delegates approved the series \"Sacred Books of the East\" under the editorship of Friedrich Max M\u00fcller, bringing a vast range of religious thought to a wider readership.\nEqually, Price moved OUP towards publishing in its own right. The press had ended its relationship with Parker's in 1863 and, in 1870, bought a small London bindery for some Bible work. Macmillan's contract ended in 1880 and was not renewed. By this time, Oxford also had a London warehouse for Bible stock in Paternoster Row, and in 1880, its manager, Henry Frowde (1841\u20131927), was given the formal title of Publisher to the university. Frowde came from the book trade, not the university, and remained an enigma to many. One obituary in Oxford's staff magazine \"The Clarendonian\" admitted, \"Very few of us here in Oxford had any personal knowledge of him.\" Despite that, Frowde became vital to OUP's growth, adding new lines of books to the business, presiding over the massive publication of the Revised Version of the New Testament in 1881 and playing a key role in setting up the press's first office outside Britain, in New York City in 1896.\nPrice transformed OUP. In 1884, the year he retired as Secretary, the Delegates bought back the last shares in the business. The press was now owned wholly by the university, with its own paper mill, print shop, bindery, and warehouse. Its output had increased to include school books and modern scholarly texts such as James Clerk Maxwell's \"A Treatise on Electricity &amp; Magnetism\" (1873), which proved fundamental to Einstein's thought. Without abandoning its traditions or quality of work, Price began to turn OUP into an alert, modern publisher. In 1879, he also took on the publication that led that process to its conclusion: the massive project that became the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED).\nOffered to Oxford by James Murray and the Philological Society, the \"New English Dictionary\" was a grand academic and patriotic undertaking. Lengthy negotiations led to a formal contract. Murray was to edit a work estimated to take ten years and to cost approximately \u00a39,000. Both figures were wildly optimistic. The Dictionary began appearing in print in 1884, but the first edition was not completed until 1928, 13 years after Murray's death, costing around \u00a3375,000. This vast financial burden and its implications landed on Price's successors.\nThe next Secretary, Philip Lyttelton Gell, was appointed by the Vice-Chancellor Benjamin Jowett in 1884 but struggled and was finally dismissed in 1897. The Assistant Secretary, Charles Cannan, was instrumental in Gell's removal. Cannan took over with little fuss and even less affection for his predecessor in 1898: \"Gell was always here, but I cannot make out what he did.\"\nBy the early 20th century, OUP expanded its overseas trade, partly due to the efforts of Humphrey Milford, the publisher of the University of Oxford from 1913 to 1945. The 1920s saw skyrocketing prices of both materials and labour. Paper was hard to come by and had to be imported from South America through trading companies. Economies and markets slowly recovered as the 1920s progressed. In 1928, the press's imprint read 'London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leipzig, Toronto, Melbourne, Cape Town, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras and Shanghai'. Not all of these were full-fledged branches: in Leipzig, there was a depot run by H. Bohun Beet, and in Canada and Australia, there were small, functional depots in the cities and an army of educational representatives penetrating the rural fastnesses to sell the press's stock as well as books published by firms whose agencies were held by the press, very often including fiction and light reading. In India, the Branch depots in Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta were imposing establishments with sizeable stock inventories, for the Presidencies themselves were large markets, and the educational representatives there dealt mostly with upcountry trade.\nIn 1923, OUP established a Music Department. At the time, such musical publishing enterprises, however, were rare. and few of the Delegates or former Publishers were themselves musical or had extensive music backgrounds. OUP bought an Anglo-French Music Company and all its facilities, connections, and resources. This concentration provided OUP two mutually reinforcing benefits: a niche in music publishing unoccupied by potential competitors and a branch of music performance and composition that the English themselves had largely neglected. Hinnells proposes that the early Music Department's \"mixture of scholarship and cultural nationalism\" in an area of music with largely unknown commercial prospects was driven by its sense of cultural philanthropy (given the press's academic background) and a desire to promote \"national music outside the German mainstream.\"\nIt was not until 1939 that the Music Department showed its first profitable year.\nThe Depression of 1929 dried profits from the Americas to a trickle, and India became 'the one bright spot' in an otherwise dismal picture. Bombay was the nodal point for distribution to the Africas and onward sale to Australasia, and people who trained at the three major depots later moved to pioneer branches in Africa and Southeast Asia.\nIn 1927\u20131934 Oxford University Press, Inc., New York, was reorganized by Geoffrey Cumberlege to return it to profitability from the lows of the Depression years. (In 1945\u20131956, Cumberlege would succeed Milford as publisher to the University of Oxford).\nThe period following World War II saw consolidation in the face of the break-up of the Empire and the post-war reorganization of the Commonwealth.\nIn the 1960s, OUP Southern Africa started publishing local authors for the general reader, but also for schools and universities, under its Three Crowns Books imprint. Its territory includes Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Namibia, as well as South Africa, the biggest market of the five. OUP Southern Africa is now one of the three biggest educational publishers in South Africa. It focuses on publishing textbooks, dictionaries, atlases, supplementary material for schools, and university textbooks. Its author base is overwhelmingly local, and in 2008, it partnered with the university to support scholarships for South Africans studying postgraduate degrees.\nOperations in South Asia and East and South East Asia were and, in the case of the former, remain significant parts of the company.\nToday, the North American branch in New York City is primarily a distribution branch to facilitate the sale of Oxford Bibles in the United States. It also handles marketing of all books of its parent, Macmillan.\nBy the end of 2021, OUP USA had published eighteen Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning books.\nIn March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic its Bookshop on the High Street closed.\nOn 27 August 2021, OUP closed Oxuniprint, its printing division. The closure will mark the \"final chapter\" of OUP's centuries-long history of printing.\nMuseum.\nThe Oxford University Press Museum is located on Great Clarendon Street, Oxford. Visits must be booked in advance and are led by an archive staff member. Displays include a 19th-century printing press, the OUP buildings, and the printing and history of the \"Oxford Almanack\", \"Alice in Wonderland\" and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nClarendon Press.\nOUP came to be known as \"(The) Clarendon Press\" when printing moved from the Sheldonian Theatre to the Clarendon Building in Broad Street in 1713. The name continued to be used when OUP moved to its present site in Oxford in 1830. The label \"Clarendon Press\" took on a new meaning when OUP began publishing books through its London office in the early 20th century. To distinguish the two offices, London books were labelled \"Oxford University Press\" publications, while those from Oxford were labelled \"Clarendon Press\" books. This labelling ceased in the 1970s when the London office of OUP closed. Today, OUP reserves \"Clarendon Press\" as an imprint for Oxford publications of particular academic importance.\nScholarly journals.\nOUP as Oxford Journals has also been a major publisher of academic journals, both in the sciences and the humanities; as of 2024[ [update]] it publishes more than 500 journals on behalf of learned societies around the world. It has been noted as one of the first university presses to publish an open access journal (\"Nucleic Acids Research\"), and probably the first to introduce so-called hybrid open access journals, offering \"optional open access\" to authors, which provides all readers with online access to their paper free of charge. The \"Oxford Open\" model applies to the majority of their journals. OUP is a member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association.\nOUP is a signatory of the SDG Publishers Compact, and has taken steps to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the publishing industry. These include the publishing of a new series of Oxford Open Journals, including \"Oxford Open Climate Change\", \"Oxford Open Energy\", \"Oxford Open Immunology\", \"Oxford Open Infrastructure and Health\", and \"Oxford Open Digital Health\".\nSeries and titles.\nOxford University Press publishes a variety of dictionaries (e.g. \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\", \"Compact Oxford English Dictionary\", \"Compact Editions of the Oxford English Dictionary\", \"Compact Oxford English Dictionary of Current English\", \"Concise Oxford English Dictionary\", \"Oxford Dictionary of Marketing\", \"Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary)\", English as a second or foreign language resources (e.g. \"Let's Go\"), English language exams (e.g. Oxford Test of English and the Oxford Placement Test), bibliographies (e.g., \"Oxford Bibliographies Online\"), miscellaneous series such as \"Very Short Introductions\", and books on Indology, music, classics, literature, history, Bibles, and atlases. Many of these are published under the Oxford Languages brand.\nClarendon Scholarships.\nSince 2001, Oxford University Press has financially supported the Clarendon bursary, a University of Oxford graduate scholarship scheme.\nControversies.\nTehran Book Fair controversy.\nIn February 1989, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa urging the execution of British author Salman Rushdie and of all involved in the publication of his novel \"The Satanic Verses\". Rushdie went into hiding, and an international movement began to boycott book trading with Iran. There was, therefore, outrage when, in April 1989, OUP broke the worldwide embargo and chose to attend the Tehran Book Fair. OUP justified this by saying, \"We deliberated about it quite deeply but felt it certainly wasn't in our interests, or Iran's as a whole, to stay away.\" \"The New York Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\" both condemned Oxford's decision.\nMalcolm vs. Oxford University 1986\u20131992.\nIn 1990, in the UK Court of Appeal, author Andrew Malcolm won a landmark legal judgment against Oxford University (Press) for its breach of a contract to publish his philosophical text \"Making Names\". Reporting on the verdict in \"The Observer\", Laurence Marks wrote, \"It is the first time in living memory that Grub Street has won such a victory over its oppressors\". The Appeal Court judges were highly critical of Oxford's conduct of the affair and the litigation. Lord Justice Mustill declared, \"The Press is one of the longest-established publishing houses in the United Kingdom, and no doubt in the world. They must have been aware from the outset that the absence of agreement on the matters in question [the book's print-run and format] was not, in the trade, regarded as preventing a formal agreement from coming into existence. Candour would, I believe, have required that this should have been made clear to the judge and ourselves, rather than a determined refusal to let the true position come to light... This is not quite all. I do not know whether an outsider studying the history of this transaction and of this litigation would feel that, in his self-financed struggle with the assembled Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford the appellant has had a fair crack of the whip. I certainly do not... Mr Charkin took the decision [to renege on the OUP editor's contract], not because he thought the book was no good - he had never seen it and the reports were favourable - but because he thought it would not sell. Let there be no mistake about it, the failure of this transaction was about money, not prestige. Nor does the course of the litigation give any reason to suppose that the Press had any interest but to resist the claim, no matter on what grounds, so long as they succeeded.\" Lord Justice Leggatt added: \"It is difficult to know what the Deputy Judge (Lightman) meant by a 'firm commitment' other than an intention to create legal relations. Nothing short of that would have had any value whatever for Mr Malcolm... To suggest that Mr Hardy intended to induce Mr Malcolm to revise the book by giving him a valueless assurance would be tantamount to an imputation of fraud... It follows that in my judgment when Mr Hardy used the expressions 'commitment' and 'a fair royalty' he did in fact mean what he said; and I venture to think that it would take a lawyer to arrive at any other conclusion. There was therefore an enforceable contract for the publication of Mr Malcolm's book... The Respondents' final statement may be thought unworthy of them.\"\nThe case ended in July 1992 with a Tomlin order, a damages settlement under which the servants and agents of Oxford University are permanently barred from denigrating Malcolm or \"Making Names\", rendering it the first book in literary history to be afforded such legal protection. The case was reported to have cost Oxford over \u00a3500,000.\nClosure of poetry list.\nIn November 1998, OUP announced the closure, on commercial grounds, of its modern poetry list. Andrew Potter, OUP's director of music, trade paperbacks and Bibles, told \"The Times\" that the list \"just about breaks even. The university expects us to operate on commercial grounds, especially in this day and age.\" In the same article, the poet D. J. Enright, who had been with OUP since 1979, said, \"There was no warning. It was presented as a fait accompli. Even the poetry editor didn't know...The money involved is peanuts. It's a good list, built up over many years.\" In February 1999, Arts Minister Alan Howarth made a speech in Oxford in which he denounced the closure: \"OUP is not merely a business. It is a department of the University of Oxford and has charitable status. It is part of a great university, which the Government supports financially and which exists to develop and transmit our intellectual culture...It is a perennial complaint by the English faculty that the barbarians are at the gate. Indeed they always are. But we don't expect the gatekeepers themselves, the custodians, to be barbarians.\" Oxford's professor Valentine Cunningham wrote in the \"Times Higher Education Supplement\": \"Increasingly, (OUP) has behaved largely like a commercial outfit, with pound signs in its eyes and a readiness to dumb down for the sake of popularity and sales...Sacking poets not because they lose money but because they do not make enough of it: it is an allegory of a university press missing the point, mistaking its prime purpose.\" In March 1999 \"The Times Literary Supplement\" commissioned Andrew Malcolm to write an article under the strapline \"Why the present constitution of the OUP cannot work\". A decade later, OUP's managing director, Ivon Asquith, reflected on the public relations damage caused by the episode: \"If I had foreseen the self-inflicted wound we would suffer I would not have let the proposal get as far as the Finance Committee.\"\nTax-exemption controversies.\nSince the 1940s, both OUP and the Cambridge University Press (CUP), had made applications to the Inland Revenue for exemption from corporate tax. The first application, by CUP in 1940, was rejected \"on the ground that, since the Press was printing and publishing for the outside world and not simply for the internal use of the University, the Press's trade went beyond the purpose and objects of the University and (in terms of the Act) was not exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the University.\" Similar applications by OUP in 1944 and 1950 were also rejected by the Inland Revenue, whose officers repeatedly pointed out that the university presses were in open competition with commercial, tax-liable publishers. In November 1975, CUP's chief executive Geoffrey Cass again applied to the Inland Revenue, and a year later, CUP's tax exemption was quietly conceded. OUP's Chief Executive George Richardson followed suit in 1977. OUP's tax exemption was granted in 1978. The decisions were not made public. The issue was only brought to public attention due to press interest in OUP following the poetry list closure controversy. In 1999, the campaigner Andrew Malcolm published his second book, \"The Remedy\", where he alleged that OUP breached its 1978 tax-exemption conditions. This was reported in a front-page article in \"The Oxford Times\", along with OUP's response.\nIn March 2001, after a 28-year battle with the Indian tax authorities, OUP lost its tax exemption in India. The Supreme Court ruled that OUP was not tax exempt in the subcontinent \"because it does not carry out any university activities there but acts simply as a commercial publisher\". To pay off back taxes, owed since the 1970s, OUP was obliged to sell its Mumbai headquarters building, Oxford House. \"The Bookseller\" reported that \"The case has again raised questions about OUP's status in the UK\". In 2003, Joel Rickett of \"The Bookseller\" wrote an article in \"The Guardian\" describing the resentment of commercial rivals at OUP's tax exemption. Rickett accurately predicted that the funds which would have been paid in tax were \"likely to be used to confirm OUP's dominance by buying up other publishers.\" Between 1989 and 2018, OUP bought out over 70 rival book and journal publishers. In 2007, with the new \"public benefit\" requirement of the revised Charities Act, the issue was re-examined with particular reference to OUP. In the same year, Malcolm obtained and posted the documents of OUP's applications to the Inland Revenue for tax exemption in the 1940s and 1950s (unsuccessful) and the 1970s (successful). In 2008, CUP's and OUP's privilege was attacked by rival publishers. In 2009, \"The Guardian\" invited Andrew Malcolm to write an article on the subject.\nEast African bribery scandal.\nIn July 2012, the UK's Serious Fraud Office found OUP's branches in Kenya and Tanzania guilty of bribery to obtain school bookselling contracts sponsored by the World Bank. Oxford was fined \u00a31.9 million \"in recognition of sums it received which were generated through unlawful conduct\" and barred from applying for World Bank-financed projects for three years.\nUyghurs.\nIn December 2023, concerns were raised that OUP had published an academic paper based on genetic data taken from the Uyghur population of Xinjiang, a Turkic ethnic group in China. Rhys Blakely, a science correspondent for \"The Times\", reported: \"The research has been published online by Oxford University Press (OUP) in a journal that receives financial support from China's Ministry of Justice. The highly unusual deal will raise fears that Oxford risks becoming entangled in human rights abuses against the Uighur community. It will also add to concerns over China's efforts to influence UK academia.\" In February, OUP announced that it was carrying out internal investigations into two further studies, based on DNA taken from China's Xibe ethnic minority. On 17 May, \"The Times\" reported that Oxford had retracted the two studies, quoting a statement from the OUP: \"Earlier this year, we were alerted to concerns regarding two papers in Forensics Sciences Research. Based on the information we received, we undertook further investigation and took the decision to retract the papers, in line with industry standard processes.\"\nIn July 2025, OUP ended its publication of \"Forensic Sciences Research\" (FSR), a journal sponsored by China's Ministry of Justice, following ethical concerns related to research involving DNA data from Uyghur and other ethnic minorities in China. Critics raised issues about the lack of meaningful consent from participants, particularly in regions like Xinjiang, where state surveillance and coercion are prevalent. Several studies published in the journal were conducted or funded by Chinese police and security agencies, raising questions about the independence and ethical standards of the research.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48519", "revid": "488581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48519", "title": "Highway", "text": "Public road or other public way on land\nA highway is any public or private road or other public way on land. It includes not just major roads, but also other public roads and rights of way. In the United States, it is also used as an equivalent term to controlled-access highway, or a translation for \"motorway\", \"Autobahn\", \"autostrada\", \"autoroute\", etc.\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, the use of the term predates the 12th century. According to Etymonline, \"high\" is in the sense of \"main\".\nIn North American and Australian English, major roads such as controlled-access highways or arterial roads are often state highways (Canada: provincial highways). Other roads may be designated \"county highways\" in the US and Ontario. These classifications refer to the level of government (state, provincial, county) that maintains the roadway. In British English, \"highway\" is primarily a legal term. Everyday use normally implies roads, while the legal use covers any route or path with a public right of access, including footpaths etc.\nThe term has led to several related derived terms, including highway system, highway code, highway patrol and highwayman.\nOverview.\nMajor highways are often named and numbered by the governments that typically develop and maintain them. Australia's Highway 1 is the longest national highway in the world at over and runs almost the entire way around the continent. China has the world's largest network of highways, followed closely by the United States. Some highways, like the Pan-American Highway or the European routes, span multiple countries. Some major highway routes include ferry services, such as US Route\u00a010, which crosses Lake Michigan.\nTraditionally highways were used by people on foot or on horses. Later they also accommodated carriages, bicycles and eventually motor cars, facilitated by advancements in road construction. In the 1920s and 1930s, many nations began investing heavily in highway systems in an effort to spur commerce and bolster national defence.\nMajor highways that connect cities in populous developed and developing countries usually incorporate features intended to enhance the road's capacity, efficiency, and safety to various degrees. Such features include a reduction in the number of locations for user access, the use of dual carriageways with two or more lanes on each carriageway, and grade-separated junctions with other roads and modes of transport. These features are typically present on highways built as \"motorways\" (\"freeways\").\nTerminology.\nEngland and Wales.\nThe general legal definition deals with right of use, not the form of construction; this is distinct from e.g. the popular use of the word in the US. A highway is defined in English common law by a number of similarly worded definitions such as \"a way over which all members of the public have the right to pass and repass without hindrance\" usually accompanied by \"at all times\"; ownership of the ground is for most purposes irrelevant, thus the term encompasses all such ways from the widest trunk roads in public ownership to the narrowest footpath providing unlimited pedestrian access over private land.\nA highway might be open to all forms of lawful land traffic (e.g. vehicular, horse, pedestrian) or limited to specific modes of traffic; usually a highway available to vehicles is also available to foot or horse traffic, a highway available to horse traffic is available to cyclists and pedestrians; but there are exceptional cases in which a highway is only available to vehicles, or is subdivided into dedicated parallel sections for different users.\nA highway can share ground with a private right of way for which full use is not available to the general public: for example farm roads which the owner may use for any purpose but for which the general public only has a right of use on foot or horseback. The status of \"highway\" on most older roads has been gained by established public use, while newer roads are typically \"dedicated\" as highways from the time they are adopted (taken into the care and control of a council or other public authority). In England and Wales, a public highway is also known as \"The King's Highway\".\nThe core definition of a highway is modified in various legislation for a number of purposes but only for the specific matters dealt with in each such piece of legislation. This is typically in the case of bridges, tunnels and other structures whose ownership, mode of use or availability would otherwise exclude them from the general definition of a highway. Recent examples include toll bridges and tunnels which have the definition of \"highway\" imposed upon them (in a legal order applying only to the individual structure) to allow application of most traffic laws to those using them but without causing all of the general obligations or rights of use otherwise applicable to a highway.\nLimited access highways for vehicles, with their own traffic rules, are called \"motorways\" in the UK.\nScotland.\nScots law is similar to English law with regard to highways but with differing terminology and legislation. What is defined in England as a \"highway\" will often in Scotland be what is defined by s.151 Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 (but only \"in this act\" although other legislation could imitate) simply as a road, that is:\nThe word \"highway\" is itself no longer a statutory expression in Scots law but remains in common law.\nUnited States.\nIn American law, the word \"highway\" is sometimes used to denote any public way used for travel, whether a \"road, street, and parkway\"; however, in practical and useful meaning, a \"highway\" is a major and significant, well-constructed road that is capable of carrying reasonably heavy to extremely heavy traffic. Highways generally have a route number designated by the state and federal departments of transportation.\nCalifornia Vehicle Code, Sections 360, 590, define a \"highway\" as only a way open for use by motor vehicles, but the California Supreme Court has held that \"the definition of 'highway' in the Vehicle Code is used for special purposes of that act\" and that canals of the Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice are \"highways\" that are entitled to be maintained with state highway funds.\nHistory.\nLarge scale highway systems developed in the 20th century as automobile usage increased. The first United States limited-access road was constructed on Long Island, New York, and known as the Long Island Motor Parkway or the Vanderbilt Motor Parkway. It was completed in 1911. It included many modern features, including banked turns, guard rails and reinforced concrete tarmac. Traffic could turn left between the parkway and connectors, crossing oncoming traffic, so it was not a controlled-access highway (or \"freeway\" as later defined by the federal government's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices).\nItaly was the first country in the world to build controlled-access highways reserved for fast traffic and for motor vehicles only. The \"Autostrada dei Laghi\" (\"Lakes Highway\"), the first built in the world, connecting Milan to Lake Como and Lake Maggiore, and now parts of the A8 and A9 highways, was devised by Piero Puricelli and was inaugurated in 1924. This highway, called \"autostrada\", contained only one lane in each direction and no interchanges.\nThe Southern State Parkway opened in 1927, while the Long Island Motor Parkway was closed in 1937 and replaced by the Northern State Parkway (opened 1931) and the contiguous Grand Central Parkway (opened 1936). In Germany, construction of the Bonn-Cologne Autobahn began in 1929 and was opened in 1932 by Konrad Adenauer, then the mayor of Cologne. Soon the Autobahn was the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opening in 1935.\nIn the US, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act) enacted a fund to create an extensive highway system. In 1922, the first blueprint for a national highway system (the Pershing Map) was published. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 allocated $25 billion for the construction of the Interstate Highway System over a 20-year period.\nIn Great Britain, the Special Roads Act 1949 provided the legislative basis for roads for restricted classes of vehicles and non-standard or no speed limits applied (later mostly termed motorways but now with speed limits not exceeding 70\u00a0mph); in terms of general road law this legislation overturned the usual principle that a road available to vehicular traffic was also available to horse or pedestrian traffic as is usually the only practical change when non-motorways are reclassified as \"special roads\". The first section of motorway in the UK opened in 1958 (part of the M6 motorway) and then in 1959 the first section of the M1 motorway.\nDesign.\nClassification.\nIn the United States, Federal Highway Administration classifies highways into the following categories:\nThis classification is based on the concept of accessibility and mobility. High mobility roads are considered arterial roads, roads with high accessibility are considered local roads, while those balancing between mobility and accessibility are called collectors.\nSimilarly in Europe, the European Commission defines the road categories as:\nMetrics.\nThere are three speed performance measures for highways:\nAn additional metric involves delays. Control delays are delays caused by traffic control devices. According to \"Highway Capacity Manual\", control delay at a signalized intersection may be calculated as a sum of uniform delay, incremental delay, and initial queue delay:\nformula_1\nwhere:\nPreservation of highway functions.\nAs local community grows, the function of the highway may get degraded. To maintain a good balance between accessibility and mobility, design methods such as access management, context sensitive design, transit-oriented development, travel demand management, and corridor management planning are used. Some of the enhancements are done during future rehabilitation projects after the highway constructions are finished, especially for the right-of-way arterial highways.745\nTo minimize local activities' disruptions to the arterial roads, some arterials have frontage road to separate from these activities.744\nSocial effects.\nOften reducing travel times relative to city or town streets, highways with limited access and grade separation can create increased opportunities for people to travel for business, trade or pleasure and also provide trade routes for goods. Highways can reduce commute and other travel time but additional road capacity can also release latent traffic demand. If not accurately predicted at the planning stage, this extra traffic may lead to the new road becoming congested sooner than would otherwise be anticipated by considering increases in vehicle ownership. More roads allow drivers to use their cars when otherwise alternatives may have been sought, or the journey may not have been made, which can mean that a new road brings only short-term mitigation of traffic congestion.\nWhere highways are created through existing communities, there can be reduced community cohesion and more difficult local access. Consequently, property values have decreased in many cutoff neighborhoods, leading to decreased housing quality over time. Mostly in the U.S., many of these effects are from racist planning practices from before the advent of civil rights. This would result in the vast majority of displacement and social effects mostly going to people like African Americans.\nIn recent times, the use of freeway removal or the public policy of urban planning to demolish freeways and create mixed-use urban areas, parks, residential, commercial, or other land uses is being popular in many cities to combat most of the social problems caused from highways.\nEconomic effects.\nIn transport, demand can be measured in numbers of journeys made or in total distance travelled across all journeys (e.g. passenger-kilometres for public transport or vehicle-kilometres of travel (VKT) for private transport). Supply is considered to be a measure of capacity. The price of the good (travel) is measured using the generalised cost of travel, which includes both money and time expenditure.\nThe effect of increases in supply (capacity) are of particular interest in transport economics (see induced demand), as the potential environmental consequences are significant (see \"externalities\" below).\nIn addition to providing benefits to their users, transport networks impose both positive and negative externalities on non-users. The consideration of these externalities\u2014particularly the negative ones\u2014is a part of transport economics. Positive externalities of transport networks may include the ability to provide emergency services, increases in land value and agglomeration benefits. Negative externalities are wide-ranging and may include local air pollution, noise pollution, light pollution, safety hazards, community severance and congestion. The contribution of transport systems to potentially hazardous climate change is a significant negative externality which is difficult to evaluate quantitatively, making it difficult (but not impossible) to include in transport economics-based research and analysis. Congestion is considered a negative externality by economists.\nA 2016 study found that for the United States, \"a 10% increase in a region's stock of highways causes a 1.7% increase in regional patenting over a five-year period.\" A 2021 study found that areas that obtained access to a new highway experienced a substantial increase in top-income taxpayers and a decline in low-income taxpayers. Highways also contributed to job and residential urban sprawl.\nEnvironmental effects.\nHighways are extended linear sources of pollution.\nRoadway noise increases with operating speed so major highways generate more noise than arterial streets. Therefore, considerable noise health effects are expected from highway systems. Noise mitigation strategies exist to reduce sound levels at nearby sensitive receptors. The idea that highway design could be influenced by acoustical engineering considerations first arose about 1973.\nAir quality issues: Highways may contribute fewer emissions than arterials carrying the same vehicle volumes. This is because high, constant-speed operation creates an emissions reduction compared to vehicular flows with stops and starts. However, concentrations of air pollutants near highways may be higher due to increased traffic volumes. Therefore, the risk of exposure to elevated levels of air pollutants from a highway may be considerable, and further magnified when highways have traffic congestion.\nNew highways can also cause habitat fragmentation, encourage urban sprawl and allow human intrusion into previously untouched areas, as well as (counterintuitively) increasing congestion, by increasing the number of intersections.\nThey can also reduce the use of public transport, indirectly leading to greater pollution.\nHigh-occupancy vehicle lanes are being added to some newer/reconstructed highways in the United States and other countries around the world to encourage carpooling and mass transit. These lanes help reduce the number of cars on the highway and thus reduces pollution and traffic congestion by promoting the use of carpooling in order to be able to use these lanes. However, they tend to require dedicated lanes on a highway, which makes them difficult to construct in dense urban areas where they are the most effective.\nTo address habitat fragmentation, wildlife crossings have become increasingly popular in many countries. Wildlife crossings allow animals to safely cross human-made barriers like highways.\nHighways may have some positive impact on nature only in the distant future:\nRoad traffic safety.\nRoad traffic safety describes the safety performance of roads and streets, and methods used to reduce the harm (deaths, injuries, and property damage) on the highway system from traffic collisions. It includes the design, construction and regulation of the roads, the vehicles used on them and the training of drivers and other road-users.\nA report published by the World Health Organization in 2004 estimated that some 1.2 million people were killed and 50 million injured on the roads around the world each year and was the leading cause of death among children 10\u201319 years of age.\nThe report also noted that the problem was most severe in developing countries and that simple prevention measures could halve the number of deaths. For reasons of clear data collection, only harm involving a road vehicle is included. A person tripping with fatal consequences or dying for some unrelated reason on a public road is not included in the relevant statistics.\nStatistics.\nThe United States has the world's largest network of highways, including both the Interstate Highway System and the United States Numbered Highway System. At least one of these networks is present in every state and they interconnect most major cities. It is also the world's most expensive mega-project, as the entirety of the Interstate Highway System was estimated to cost $27 billion in 1955 (equivalent to $ in 2024).\nChina's highway network is the second most extensive in the world, with a total length of about . China's expressway network is the longest Expressway system in the world, and it is quickly expanding, stretching some at the end of 2011. In 2008 alone, expressways were added to the network.\nBus lane.\nSouth Korea.\nIn South Korea, in February 1995 a bus lane (essentially an HOV-9) was established between the northern terminus and Sintanjin for important holidays and on 1 July 2008 bus lane enforcement between Seoul and Osan (Sintanjin on weekends) became daily between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. On 1 October this was adjusted to 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays, and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekends.\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong, some highways are set up with bus lanes to solve the traffic congestion.\nPhilippines.\nTraffic congestion was a principal problem in major roads and highways in the Philippines, especially in Metro Manila and other major cities. The government decided to set up some bus lanes in Metro Manila like in the Epifanio delos Santos Avenue.\nHighways by country.\nThe following is a list of highways by country in alphabetical order.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a type of fore-and-aft rig. The mainsail may be of any type, most often Bermuda rig, but also others, such as gaff or gunter.\nIn naval terminology, \"sloop-of-war\" refers to the purpose of the craft, rather than to the specific size or sail-plan, and thus a sloop should not be confused with a sloop-of-war. As with many rig definitions, it was some time before the term sloop referred to the type of rig.\nRegionally, the definition also takes into account the position of the mast. A forward mast placement and a fixed (as opposed to ) bowsprit, but with two headsails may give categorisation as a sloop. An example is the Friendship Sloop.48-53\nOrigins.\nThe name originates from the Dutch \"sloep\", which is related to the Old English \"sl\u016bpan\", to glide. The original Dutch term applied to an open rowing boat.49 A sloop is usually regarded as a single-masted rig with a single headsail and a fore-and-aft mainsail. In this form, the sloop is the commonest of all sailing rigs\u00a0\u2013 with the Bermuda sloop being the default rig for leisure craft, being used on types that range from simple cruising dinghies to large racing yachts with high-tech sail fabrics and large powerful winches.If the vessel has two or more headsails, the term cutter is usually applied, though there are regional and historic variations on this. A boat with a forward mast placement and a fixed bowsprit, but more than one headsail, may be called a sloop. The Friendship sloop is an example of this. Particularly with historic craft, categorisation as a cutter may rely on having a running bowsprit.\nVariations.\nBefore the Bermuda rig became popular outside of Bermuda in the early 20th century, a (non-Bermudian) sloop might carry one or more square-rigged topsails, hung from a topsail yard and sheeted to a lower yard.\nA sloop's headsail may be masthead-rigged or fractional-rigged. On a masthead-rigged sloop, the forestay (on which the headsail is carried) attaches at the top of the mast. On a fractional-rigged sloop, the forestay attaches to the mast at a point below the top. A sloop may use a bowsprit, a spar that projects forward from the bow.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is Distinguished Professor Emerita of Feminist Studies and History of Consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Davis was a longtime member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and a founding member of the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism (CCDS). She has been active in movements such as the Occupy movement and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.\nDavis was born in Birmingham, Alabama; she studied at Brandeis University and the University of Frankfurt. She also studied at the University of California, San Diego, before moving to East Germany, where she completed some studies for a doctorate at the Humboldt-University of Berlin. After returning to the United States, she joined the CPUSA and became involved in the second-wave feminist movement and the campaign against the Vietnam War.\nIn 1969, she was hired as an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). UCLA's governing Board of Regents soon fired her due to her membership in the CPUSA. After a court ruled the firing illegal, the university fired her for the use of inflammatory language. In 1970, guns belonging to Davis were used in an armed takeover of a courtroom in Marin County, California, in which four people were killed. Prosecuted for three capital felonies\u2014including conspiracy to murder\u2014she was held in jail for more than a year before being acquitted of all charges in 1972.\nDuring the 1980s, Davis was twice the Communist Party's candidate for the Vice President of the United States. In 1997, she co-founded Critical Resistance, an organization working to abolish the prison\u2013industrial complex. In 1991, amid the dissolution of the Soviet Union, she broke away from the CPUSA to help establish the CCDS. That same year, she joined the feminist studies department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she became department director before retiring in 2008.\nDavis has received various awards, including the Soviet Union's Lenin Peace Prize (since 2025 she is its last living recipient) and induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Due to accusations that she advocates political violence and due to her support of the Soviet Union, she has been a controversial figure. In 2020, she was listed as the 1971 \"Woman of the Year\" in \"Time\" magazine's \"100 Women of the Year\" edition. In 2020, she was included on \"Time\"'s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2025, Davis was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Letters from the University of Cambridge. Davis was also honored in 2025 with the Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz Award given by at the CUNY Graduate Center.\nEarly life.\nAngela Davis was born on January 26, 1944, in Birmingham, Alabama. She was christened at her father's Episcopal church. Her family lived in the \"Dynamite Hill\" neighborhood, which was marked in the 1950s by the bombings of houses in an attempt to intimidate and drive out middle-class black people who had moved there. Davis occasionally spent time on her uncle's farm and with friends in New York City. Her siblings include two brothers, Ben and Reginald, and a sister, Fania. Ben played defensive back for the Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nDavis attended Carrie A. Tuggle School, a segregated black elementary school, and later, Parker Annex, a middle-school branch of Parker High School in Birmingham. During this time, Davis's mother, Sallye Bell Davis, was a national officer and leading organizer of the Southern Negro Youth Congress, an organization influenced by the Communist Party aimed at building alliances among African Americans in the South. Davis grew up surrounded by communist organizers and thinkers, who significantly influenced her intellectual development. Among them was the Southern Negro Youth Congress official Louis E. Burnham, whose daughter Margaret Burnham was Davis's friend from childhood, as well as her co-counsel during Davis's 1971 trial for murder and kidnapping.\nDavis was involved in her church youth group as a child and attended Sunday school regularly. She attributes much of her political involvement to her involvement with the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. She also participated in the Girl Scouts 1959 national roundup in Colorado. As a Girl Scout, she marched and picketed to protest racial segregation in Birmingham.\nBy her junior year of high school, Davis had been accepted by an American Friends Service Committee (Quaker) program that placed black students from the South in integrated schools in the North. She chose Elisabeth Irwin High School in Greenwich Village. There she was recruited by a communist youth group, Advance.\nEducation.\nBrandeis University.\nDavis was awarded a scholarship to Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, where she was one of three black students in her class. She encountered the Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse at a rally during the Cuban Missile Crisis and became his student. In a 2007 television interview, Davis said, \"Herbert Marcuse taught me that it was possible to be an academic, an activist, a scholar, and a revolutionary.\" She worked part-time to earn enough money to travel to France and Switzerland and attended the eighth World Festival of Youth and Students in Helsinki. She returned home in 1963 to a Federal Bureau of Investigation interview about her attendance at the communist-sponsored festival.\nDuring her second year at Brandeis, Davis decided to major in French and continued her study of philosopher and writer Jean-Paul Sartre. She was accepted by the Hamilton College Junior Year in France Program. Classes were initially at Biarritz and later at the Sorbonne. In Paris, she and other students lived with a French family. She was in Biarritz when she learned of the 1963 Birmingham church bombing, committed by members of the Ku Klux Klan, in which four black girls were killed; she had been personally acquainted with the victims.\nWhile completing her degree in French, Davis realized that her primary area of interest was philosophy. She was particularly interested in Marcuse's ideas. On returning to Brandeis, she sat in on his course. She wrote in her autobiography that Marcuse was approachable and helpful. She began making plans to attend the University of Frankfurt for graduate work in philosophy. In 1965, she graduated \"magna cum laude\", a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\nUniversity of Frankfurt.\nIn West Germany, with a monthly stipend of $100, she lived first with a German family and later with a group of students in a loft in an old factory. After visiting East Berlin during the annual May Day celebration, she felt that the East German government was dealing better with the residual effects of fascism than were the West Germans. Many of her roommates were active in the radical Socialist German Student Union (SDS), and Davis participated in some SDS actions. Events in the United States, including the formation of the Black Panther Party and the transformation of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to an all-black organization, drew her interest upon her return.\nPostgraduate work.\nMarcuse had moved to a position at the University of California, San Diego, and Davis followed him there after her two years in Frankfurt. Davis traveled to London to attend a conference on \"The Dialectics of Liberation\". The black contingent at the conference included the Trinidadian-American Stokely Carmichael and the British Michael X. Although moved by Carmichael's rhetoric, Davis was reportedly disappointed by her colleagues' black nationalist sentiments and their rejection of communism as a \"white man's thing\".\nShe joined the Che-Lumumba Club, an all-black branch of the Communist Party USA named for revolutionaries Che Guevara and Patrice Lumumba, of Cuba and Congo, respectively.\nDavis earned a master's degree from the University of California, San Diego, in 1968. She completed some work for a PhD at the University of California, San Diego around 1970 but never received a degree because her manuscripts were confiscated by the FBI. Instead, two years later, she received three honorary doctorates: In August 1972 from Moscow State University, and from the University of Tashkent during that same visit, and in September 1972 from the Karl-Marx University in Leipzig, Germany. In 1981, she returned to Germany to continue working on her PhD.\nProfessor at the University of California, Los Angeles, 1969\u201370.\nBeginning in 1969, Davis was an acting assistant professor in the philosophy department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Although both Princeton and Swarthmore had tried to recruit her, she opted for UCLA because of its urban location. At that time, she was known as a radical feminist and activist, a member of the Communist Party USA, and an affiliate of the Los Angeles chapter of the Black Panther Party.\nDavis had previously joined the Communist Party in 1968 and had become a member of the Black Panther Party, working with a branch of the Black Panther Party in Los Angeles where she directed political education. When Black Panther Party leadership determined that party members could not also be affiliated with other parties, Davis retained her Communist Party membership although she continued to work with the Black Panther Party.\nIn 1969, the University of California initiated a policy against hiring Communists. At their September 19, 1969, meeting, the Board of Regents fired Davis from her $10,000-a-year post () because of her membership in the Communist Party, urged on by California Governor and future president Ronald Reagan. Judge Jerry Pacht ruled the Regents could not fire Davis solely because of her affiliation with the Communist Party, and she resumed her post.\nThe Regents fired Davis again on June 20, 1970, for the \"inflammatory language\" she had used in four different speeches. The report stated, \"We deem particularly offensive such utterances as her statement that the regents 'killed, brutalized (and) murdered' the People's Park demonstrators, and her repeated characterizations of the police as 'pigs'\".&lt;ref name=\"Regents/UCLA\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The American Association of University Professors censured the board for this action.\nArrest and trial.\nDavis was a supporter of the Soledad Brothers, three inmates who were accused and charged with the killing of a prison guard at Soledad Prison.\nOn August 7, 1970, heavily armed 17-year-old African-American high-school student Jonathan Jackson, whose brother was George Jackson, one of the three Soledad Brothers, gained control of a courtroom in Marin County, California. He armed the Black defendants and took Judge Harold Haley, Deputy District Attorney Gary W. Thomas, and three female jurors as hostages. As Jackson transported the hostages and three black defendants away from the courtroom in a van, one of the defendants, James McClain, shot at the police. The police returned fire.\nThe judge and three of the men were killed in the melee. One of the jurors, the prosecutor, and one of the attackers, Ruchell Magee, were injured. Although the judge was shot in the head with a blast from a shotgun which had been taped to his neck, he also suffered a chest wound from a bullet that may have been fired from outside the van. Evidence during the trial showed that either could have been fatal. Davis had purchased several of the firearms Jackson used in the attack, including the shotgun used to shoot Haley, which she bought at a San Francisco pawn shop two days before the incident. She was also found to have been corresponding with one of the inmates involved.\nDavis had befriended George and Jonathan Jackson doing work attempting to free the Soledad Brothers. She had communicated frequently with George Jackson over letters and worked extensively with Jonathan Jackson in her work with the Soledad Brothers Defense Committee. She had grown close with the Jackson family in general during this time while working with them and speaking at events together.\nAs California considers \"all persons concerned in the commission of a crime,\u00a0... whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, or aid and abet in its commission,\u00a0... are principals in any crime so committed\", Davis was charged with \"aggravated kidnapping and first degree murder in the death of Judge Harold Haley\", and Marin County Superior Court Judge Peter Allen Smith issued a warrant for her arrest. Hours after the judge issued the warrant on August 14, 1970, a massive attempt to find and arrest Davis began. On August 18, four days after the warrant was issued, the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover listed Davis on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitive List; she was the third woman and the 309th person to be listed.\nSoon after, Davis became a fugitive and fled California. According to her autobiography, during this time she hid in friends' homes and moved at night. On October 13, 1970, FBI agents found her at a Howard Johnson Motor Lodge in New York City. President Richard M. Nixon congratulated the FBI on its \"capture of the dangerous terrorist Angela Davis.\"\nOn January 5, 1971, Davis appeared at Marin County Superior Court and declared her innocence before the court and nation: \"I now declare publicly before the court, before the people of this country that I am innocent of all charges which have been leveled against me by the state of California.\" John Abt, general counsel of the Communist Party USA, was one of the first attorneys to represent Davis for her alleged involvement in the shootings.\nWhile being held in the Women's Detention Center, Davis was initially segregated from other prisoners, in solitary confinement. With the help of her legal team, she obtained a federal court order to get out of the segregated area.\nAcross the nation, thousands began organizing a movement to gain her release. In New York City, black writers formed a committee called the Black People in Defense of Angela Davis. By February 1971, more than 200 local committees in the United States, and 67 in foreign countries, worked to free Davis from jail. John Lennon and Yoko Ono contributed to this campaign with the song \"Angela\". In 1972, after a 16-month incarceration, the state allowed her release on bail from the county jail. On February 23, 1972, Rodger McAfee, a dairy farmer from Fresno, California, paid her $100,000 () bail with the help of Steve Sparacino, a wealthy business owner. The United Presbyterian Church paid some of her legal defense expenses.\nA defense motion for a change of venue was granted, they had requested the trial be held in San Francisco but that was refused and instead the trial was moved to Santa Clara County. \nAt the trial witnesses said that Davis had purchased the guns to protect the Soledad Brothers defense headquarters. On June 4, 1972, after 13 hours of deliberations, the all-white jury returned a verdict of not guilty. After the verdict, one juror, Ralph DeLange, made the Black Power salute to a crowd of spectators, which he later told reporters was to show \"a unity of opinion for all oppressed people\". Ten jurors later attended victory celebrations with the defense. The fact that she owned the guns used in the crime was judged insufficient to establish her role in the plot. She was represented by Howard Moore Jr. and Leo Branton Jr., who hired psychologists to help the defense determine who in the jury pool might favor their arguments, a technique that has since become more common. However the defense were bitter that the jury was all-white. They also hired experts to challenge the reliability of eyewitness accounts.\nOther activities in the 1970s.\nCuba.\nAfter her acquittal, Davis went on an international speaking tour in 1972 and the tour included a trip to Cuba, where she had previously been received by Fidel Castro as a member of a Communist Party delegation in 1969. Robert F. Williams, Huey Newton and Stokely Carmichael had also visited Cuba, and Assata Shakur later moved there after she escaped from a U.S. prison. At a mass rally held by Afro-Cubans, Davis was reportedly barely able to speak because her reception was so enthusiastic. She perceived that Cuba was a racism-free country, which led her to believe that \"only under socialism could the fight against racism be successfully executed.\" When she returned to the U.S., her socialist leanings increasingly influenced her understanding of racial struggles. In 1974, she attended the Second Congress of the Federation of Cuban Women.\nSoviet Union.\nIn 1971, the CIA estimated that five percent of Soviet propaganda efforts were directed towards the Angela Davis campaign. In August 1972, Davis visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Central Committee. \nOn May 1, 1979, she was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union. She visited Moscow later that month to accept the prize, where she praised \"the glorious name\" of Vladimir Lenin and the \"great October Revolution\". \nEast Germany.\nThe East German government organized an extensive campaign on behalf of Davis. In September 1972, Davis visited East Germany, where she met the state's leader Erich Honecker, received an honorary degree from the University of Leipzig and the Star of People's Friendship from Walter Ulbricht. On September 11 in East Berlin she delivered a speech, \"Not Only My Victory\", praising the GDR and USSR and denouncing American racism.\nShe visited the Berlin Wall, where she laid flowers at the memorial for Reinhold Huhn, an East German guard who had been killed by a man who was trying to escape with his family across the border in 1962. Davis said, \"We mourn the deaths of the border guards who sacrificed their lives for the protection of their socialist homeland\" and \"When we return to the USA, we shall undertake to tell our people the truth about the true function of this border.\" In 1973, she returned to East Berlin, leading the U.S. delegation to the 10th World Festival of Youth and Students. \nOn her 1972 tour, Davis also visited Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Chile.\nJonestown and Peoples Temple.\nIn the mid-1970s, Jim Jones, who developed the cult Peoples Temple, initiated friendships with progressive leaders in the San Francisco area including Dennis Banks of the American Indian Movement and Davis. On September 10, 1977, 14 months before the Temple's mass murder-suicide, Davis spoke via amateur radio telephone \"patch\" to members of his Peoples Temple who were living in Jonestown in Guyana. In her statement during the \"Six Day Siege\", she expressed support for the Peoples Temple's anti-racism efforts and she also told Temple members that there was a conspiracy against them. She said, \"When you are attacked, it is because of your progressive stand, and we feel that it is directly an attack against us as well.\" On February 28, 1978, Davis wrote to President Jimmy Carter, asking him not to assist in efforts to retrieve a child from Jonestown. Her letter called Jones \"a humanitarian in the broadest sense of the word\".\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn and political prisoners in socialist states.\nIn 1975, Soviet dissident and Nobel laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn argued in a speech before an AFL\u2013CIO meeting in New York City that Davis was derelict in having failed to support prisoners in various socialist countries around the world, given her strong opposition to the U.S. prison system. In 1972, Ji\u0159\u00ed Pelik\u00e1n wrote an open letter in which he asked her to support Czechoslovak prisoners; Davis refused, believing that the Czechoslovak prisoners were undermining the government of Hus\u00e1k and believing that Pelik\u00e1n, who was living in exile in Italy, was attacking his own country. According to Solzhenitsyn, in response to concerns about Czechoslovak prisoners being \"persecuted by the state\", Davis had responded: \"They deserve what they get. Let them remain in prison.\"\nLater academic career.\nDavis was a lecturer at the Claremont Black Studies Center at the Claremont Colleges in 1975. Attendance at the course she taught was limited to 26 students out of the more than 5,000 on campus, and she was forced to teach in secret because alumni benefactors did not want her to indoctrinate the general student population with Communist thought. College trustees made arrangements to minimize her appearance on campus, limiting her seminars to Friday evenings and Saturdays, \"when campus activity is low\".\nHer classes moved from one classroom to another and the students were sworn to secrecy. Much of this secrecy continued throughout Davis's brief time teaching at the colleges. In 2020 it was announced that Davis would be the Ena H. Thompson Distinguished Lecturer in Pomona College's history department, welcoming her back after 45 years.\nDavis taught a women's studies course at the San Francisco Art Institute in 1978 and was a professor of ethnic studies at the San Francisco State University from at least 1980 to 1984; she taught political science courses there until 1990. She was a professor in the History of Consciousness and the Feminist Studies departments at the University of California, Santa Cruz and Rutgers University from 1991 to 2008. Since then, she has been a distinguished professor emerita.\nDavis was a distinguished visiting professor at Syracuse University in the spring of 1992 and October 2010, and was the Randolph Visiting Distinguished Professor of philosophy at Vassar College in 1995.\nIn 2014, Davis returned to UCLA as a regents' lecturer. She delivered a public lecture on May 8 in Royce Hall, where she had given her first lecture 45 years earlier.\nIn 2016, Davis was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in Healing and Social Justice from the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco during its 48th annual commencement ceremony.\nPolitical activism and speeches.\nDavis accepted the Communist Party USA's nomination for vice president, as Gus Hall's running mate, in 1980 and in 1984. They received less than 0.02% of the vote in 1980. She left the party in 1991, founding the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Her group broke from the Communist Party USA because of the latter's support of the 1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt after the fall of the Soviet Union and tearing down of the Berlin Wall. Davis said that she and others who had \"circulated a petition about the need for democratization of the structures of governance of the party\" were not allowed to run for national office and thus \"in a sense\u00a0... invited to leave\". In 2014, she said she continues to have a relationship with the CPUSA but has not rejoined. In the 2020 presidential election, Davis supported the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.\nDavis is a major figure in the prison abolition movement. She has called the United States prison system the \"prison\u2013industrial complex\" and was one of the founders of Critical Resistance, a national grassroots organization dedicated to building a movement to abolish the prison system. In recent works, she has argued that the US prison system resembles a new form of slavery, pointing to the disproportionate share of the African-American population who were incarcerated. Davis advocates focusing social efforts on education and building \"engaged communities\" to solve various social problems now handled through state punishment.\nAs early as 1969, Davis began public speaking engagements. She expressed her opposition to the Vietnam War, racism, sexism, and the prison\u2013industrial complex, and her support of gay rights and other social justice movements. In 1969, she blamed imperialism for the troubles oppressed populations suffer: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nShe has continued lecturing throughout her career, including at numerous universities.\nIn 2001, she publicly spoke against the war on terror following the 9/11 attacks, continued to criticize the prison\u2013industrial complex, and discussed the broken immigration system. She said that to solve social justice issues, people must \"hone their critical skills, develop them and implement them.\" Later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, she declared that the \"horrendous situation in New Orleans\" was due to the country's structural racism, capitalism, and imperialism.\nDavis opposed the 1995 Million Man March, arguing that the exclusion of women from this event promoted male chauvinism. She said that Louis Farrakhan and other organizers appeared to prefer that women take subordinate roles in society. Together with Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw and others, she formed the African American Agenda 2000, an alliance of black feminists.\nDavis has continued to oppose the death penalty. In 2003, she lectured at Agnes Scott College, a liberal arts women's college in Decatur, Georgia, on prison reform, minority issues, and the ills of the criminal justice system.\nOn October 31, 2011, Davis spoke at the Philadelphia and Washington Square Occupy Wall Street assemblies. Due to restrictions on electronic amplification, her words were human microphoned. In 2012, Davis was awarded the 2011 Blue Planet Award, an award given for contributions to humanity and the planet.\nAt the 27th Empowering Women of Color Conference in 2012, Davis said she was a vegan. She has called for the release of Rasmea Odeh, associate director at the Arab American Action Network, who was convicted of immigration fraud in relation to her hiding of a previous murder conviction.\nDavis supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel.\nDavis was an honorary co-chair of the January 21, 2017, Women's March on Washington, which occurred the day after President Donald Trump's inauguration. The organizers' decision to make her a speaker was criticized from the right by Humberto Fontova and the \"National Review\". Libertarian journalist Cathy Young wrote that Davis's \"long record of support for political violence in the United States and the worst of human rights abusers abroad\" undermined the march.\nOn October 16, 2018, Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, presented Davis with an honorary degree during the inaugural Viola Desmond Legacy Lecture, as part of the institution's bicentennial celebration year.\nOn January 7, 2019, the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute (BCRI) rescinded Davis's Fred Shuttlesworth Human Rights Award, saying she \"does not meet all of the criteria\". Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin and others cited criticism of Davis's vocal support for Palestinian rights and the movement to boycott Israel. Davis said her loss of the award was \"not primarily an attack against me but rather against the very spirit of the indivisibility of justice.\" On January 25, the BCRI reversed its decision and issued a public apology, stating that there should have been more public consultation.\nIn November 2019, along with other public figures, Davis signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as \"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia, and racism in much of the democratic world\", and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election.\nOn January 20, 2020, Davis gave the Memorial Keynote Address at the University of Michigan's MLK Symposium.\nDavis was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2021.\nIn recent years, Davis' work has reflected her concern over the incarceration of poverty-stricken and marginalized groups. In line with this, in December 2020, it was reported that Davis entered into a collaboration with Renowned LA fashion label to create clothing inspired by black activists called \u201cHeroes of Blackness,\u201d where a beneficiary of the fashion line is Underground Grit, a prison reform group.\nPersonal life.\nFrom 1980 to 1983, Davis was married to Hilton Braithwaite. In 1997, she came out as a lesbian in an interview with \"Out\" magazine. By 2020, Davis was living with her partner, the academic Gina Dent, a fellow humanities scholar and intersectional feminist researcher at UC Santa Cruz. Together, they have advocated for the abolition of police and prisons, and for black liberation and Palestinian solidarity.\nIn a 2023 episode of the PBS series \"Finding Your Roots\", Henry Louis Gates revealed to Davis that she is a descendant of William Brewster, a passenger on the \"Mayflower\". Another ancestor revealed in the episode was Alabama politician John A. Darden, who is Davis's grandfather. In another episode titled \"Secret Lives\" it is revealed that Davis is related to Niecy Nash.\nRepresentation in other media.\nReferences in other venues.\nOn January 28, 1972, Garrett Brock Trapnell hijacked TWA Flight 2. One of his demands was Davis's release.\nIn Renato Guttuso's painting \"The Funerals of Togliatti\" (1972), Davis is depicted, among other figures of communism, in the left framework, near the author's self-portrait, Elio Vittorini, and Jean-Paul Sartre.\nIn 1971, black playwright Elvie Moore wrote the play \"Angela is Happening\", depicting Davis on trial with figures such as Frederick Douglass, Malcolm X, and H. Rap Brown as eyewitnesses proclaiming her innocence. The play was performed at the Inner City Cultural Center and at UCLA, with Pat Ballard as Davis. The documentary \"Angela Davis: Portrait of a Revolutionary\" (1972) was directed by UCLA Film School student Yolande du Luart. It follows Davis from 1969 to 1970, documenting her dismissal from UCLA. The film wrapped shooting before the Marin County incident.\nIn the movie \"Network\" (1976), Marlene Warfield's character Laureen Hobbs appears to be modeled on Davis.\nAlso in 2018, a cotton T-shirt with Davis's face on it was featured in Prada's 2018 collection.\nA mural featuring Davis was painted by Italian street artist Jorit Agoch in the Scampia neighborhood of Naples in 2019.\n\"Ms. Davis\" by Amazing Am\u00e9ziane and Sybille Titeux de la Croix is a graphic biography focusing on Davis's early years and trial. It was published in French in 2020 and in English in 2023.\nThe Angela Davis mural, painted by San Jose artist Ian S. Young, was unveiled at the African American Community Service Agency (AACSA) in San Jose, CA, on March 18, 2022. Angela Davis participated in the unveiling (Milan Balinton).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Despite only having released one album to moderate sales, their work has been featured on a number of film soundtracks. The band was fronted by Keely Hawkes, the sister of English musician Chesney Hawkes and daughter of Len 'Chip' Hawkes, a member of the English beat group the Tremeloes.\nHistory.\nTransister's formation was the culmination of various collaborations between songwriter Eric Pressly, former Danny Wilson frontman Gary Clark, and vocalist Keely Hawkes. Hawkes first made use of Pressly's songwriting on her 1993 solo debut for EMI, while Pressly and Clark first worked together in the band King L, releasing the album \"Great Day for Gravity\" in 1995. The three were encouraged by the results of their early songwriting attempts, and decided to release a six-song EP on their record label.\nTransister began to attract major label attention after KCRW DJ Christopher Douridas played a few of the self-recorded tracks on \"Morning Becomes Eclectic\" in early 1996. Interscope Records released Transister's self-titled debut in the US in 1997; UK and international distribution was handled by Virgin Records. Tracks from the album were featured on a number of film soundtracks, including \"Nightwatch\" (1997), \"Wild Things\" (1998), \"Jawbreaker\" (1999), \"Never Been Kissed\" (1999), \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000) and \"Cheaters\" (2000). Although members of the band have since gone on to other projects, Hawkes and Pressly maintained a relationship and were married on January 8, 2005.\nTheir song \"Look Who's Perfect Now\" entered the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at No.\u00a056 in March 1998. \"Look Who's Perfect Now\" also charted in Australia, where it peaked at No.\u00a076 in June 1998. A second single, \"Dizzy Moon\" peaked at No.\u00a090 in the UK in July 1998.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The peoples were also known as the Obri (modern , Obry) in the chronicles of the Rus, the Abaroi or Varchonitai (), or Pseudo-Avars in Byzantine sources, and the Apar () to the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks. They established the Avar Khaganate, which spanned the Pannonian Basin and considerable areas of Central and Eastern Europe from the late-6th to the early-9th centuries.\nThe name \"Pannonian Avars\" (after Pannonia in the upper Danube basin where they eventually settled) is used to distinguish them from the Avars of the Caucasus, a separate people with whom the Pannonian Avars may or may not have had links. Although the name \"Avar\" first appeared in the mid-5th century, the Pannonian Avars entered the historical scene in the mid-6th century, on the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe as a people who wished to escape the rule of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks. They are probably best known for their invasions and destruction in the Avar\u2013Byzantine wars from 568 to 626 and for their influence on the Slavic migrations to the Balkans.\nRecent archaeogenetic studies indicate that the Pannonian Avars were of primarily Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry similar to the forebears of modern-day people from Mongolia and the Amur River region in Manchuria, pointing to an initial rapid migration of nomadic tribes into the centre of Europe from the Eastern Eurasian Steppe. The Pannonian Avars' core may have been descended from the remnants of the Rouran Khaganate, which were accompanied by other Eurasian steppe groups.\nOrigins.\nAvars and pseudo-Avars.\nThe earliest clear reference to the Avar ethnonym comes from Priscus the Rhetor (420s\u2013after 472), who recounts that in c. 463 the \u0160aragurs and Onogurs were attacked by the Sabirs, who had been attacked by the Avars. In turn, the Avars had been driven off by people fleeing \"man-eating griffins\" coming from \"the ocean\" (\"Priscus Fr 40\"). Whilst Priscus' accounts provide some information about the ethno-political situation in the Don-Kuban-Volga region after the demise of the Huns, no unequivocal conclusions can be reached. Denis Sinor has argued that whoever the \"Avars\" referred to by Priscus were, they differed from the Avars who appear a century later, during the time of Justinian (r. 527\u2013565).\nThe next author to discuss the Avars, Menander Protector, appeared during the 6th century and wrote of G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk embassies to Constantinople in 565 and 568. The Turks appeared angry at the Byzantines for having made an alliance with the Avars, whom the Turks saw as their subjects and slaves. Turxanthos, a Turk prince, calls the Avars \"Varchonites\" and \"escaped slaves of the Turks\", who numbered \"about 20 thousand\" (\"Menander Fr 43\").\nMany more, but somewhat confusing, details come from Theophylact Simocatta, who in c. 629, describes the final two decades of the 6th century. In particular, he claims to quote a triumph letter from Turxanthos:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For this very Chagan had in fact outfought the leader of the nation of the Abdali (I mean indeed, of the Hephthalites, as they are called), conquered him, and assumed the rule of the nation. Then he [\u2026] enslaved the Avar nation.\nBut let no one think that we are distorting the history of these times because he supposes that the Avars are those barbarians neighbouring on Europe and Pannonia, and that their arrival was prior to the times of the emperor Maurice. For it is by a misnomer that the barbarians on the Ister have assumed the appellation of Avars; the origin of their race will shortly be revealed.\nSo, when the Avars had been defeated (for we are returning to the account) some of them made their escape to those who inhabit Taugast. Taugast is a famous city, which is a total of one thousand five hundred miles distant from those who are called Turks, ... Others of the Avars, who declined to humbler fortune because of their defeat, came to those who are called Moukri (Goguryeo); this nation is the closest neighbour to the men of Taugast;\nThen the Chagan embarked on yet another enterprise, and subdued all the Ogur, which is one of the strongest tribes on account of its large population and its armed training for war. These make their habitations in the east, by the course of the Til, which Turks are accustomed to call Melas. The earliest leaders of this nation were named Var and Chunni; from them some parts of those nations were also accorded their nomenclature, being called Var and Chunni.\nThen, while the emperor Justinian was in possession of the royal power, a small section of these Var and Chunni fled from that ancestral tribe and settled in Europe. These named themselves Avars and glorified their leader with the appellation of Chagan. Let us declare, without departing in the least from the truth, how the means of changing their name came to them.\u00a0[\u2026]\nWhen the Barsils, Onogurs, Sabirs, and other Hun nations in addition to these, saw that a section of those who were still Var and Chunni had fled to their regions, they plunged into extreme panic, since they suspected that the settlers were Avars. For this reason they honoured the fugitives with splendid gifts and supposed that they received from them security in exchange.\nThen, after the Var and Chunni saw the well-omened beginning to their flight, they appropriated the ambassadors' error and named themselves Avars: for among the Scythian nations that of the Avars is said to be the most adept tribe. In point of fact even up to our present times the Pseudo-Avars (for it is more correct to refer to them thus) are divided in their ancestry, some bearing the time-honoured name of Var while others are called Chunni.\nAccording to the interpretation of Dobrovits and Nechaeva, the Turks insisted that the Avars were only \"pseudo-Avars\", so as to boast that they were the only formidable power in the Eurasian steppe. The G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks claimed that the \"real Avars\" remained loyal subjects of the Turks, farther east. A political name *\"(A)Par\" \ud803\udc2f\ud803\udc3b was indeed mentioned in inscriptions honoring Kul Tigin and Bilge Qaghan, yet in Armenian sources (Egishe Vardapet, Ghazar Parpetsi, and Sebeos) \"Apar\" seemingly indicated \"a geographical area (Khorasan), which might also intimate a political formation once there\"; additionally, \"'Apar-shar', that is, \"the country of the Apar\"\" was named after possibly Hephthalites, who were known as \u6ed1 MC *\"\u0266\u02e0u\u025bt\u031a\" &gt; Ch.\"Hu\u00e1\" in Chinese sources. Even so, *\"Apar\" could not be linked to the European Avars, notwithstanding any link, if there were, between the Hephthalites and Rourans. Furthermore, Dobrovits has questioned the authenticity of Theophylact's account. As such, he has argued that Theophylact borrowed information from Menander's accounts of Byzantine\u2013Turk negotiations to meet political needs of his time\u2013i.e. to castigate and deride the Avars during a time of strained political relations between the Byzantines and Avars (coinciding with Emperor Maurice's northern Balkan campaigns).\nPaul the Deacon.\nPaul the Deacon in his \"History of the Lombards\" insisted that Avars were known previously as Huns and he conflated the two groups.\nUar, Rouran and other Central Asian peoples.\nAccording to some scholars, the Avars who settled in Pannonia originated from a confederation, formed in the Aral Sea region, by a tribe known as the Uar (also known as the \"Ouar\", \"Warr\" and \"Var\") and the Xionites (or \"Chionitae\", \"Xiyon\" etc). The Pannonian Avars were also known by names including \"Uarkhon\" and \"Varchonites\" \u00a0\u2013 which may have been a portmanteau combining names such as \"Var\" and \"Chion\". The cultural and linguistic affiliations of the Uar have remained obscure, although the Xionites had likely been speakers of Iranian and/or Turkic languages. (While the Hephthalites had also previously been part of the same confederation as the Uar and Xionites, the Hephthalites had evidently not taken part in any westward migration, and had instead remained in Central Asia, and migrated into South Asia.)\nThe 18th century historian Joseph de Guignes postulates a link between the Avars of European history with the Rouran Khaganate of Inner Asia based on a coincidence between Tardan Khan's letter to Constantinople and events recorded in Chinese sources, notably the \"Wei Shu\" and \"Bei Shi\". Chinese sources state that Bumin Qaghan, founder of the First Turkic Khaganate, defeated the Rouran, some of whom fled and joined the Western Wei. Later, Bumin's successor Muqan Qaghan defeated the Hephthalites as well as the Turkic Tiele. Superficially these victories over the Tiele, Rouran and Hephthalites echo a narrative in the \"Theophylact\", boasting of Tardan's victories over the Hephthalites, Avars and Oghurs. However, the two series of events are not synonymous: the events of the latter took place during Tardan's rule, c. 580\u2013599, whilst Chinese sources referring to the Turk defeat of the Rouran and other Central Asian peoples occurred 50 years earlier, at the founding of the First Turkic Khaganate. It is for this reason that the linguist J\u00e1nos Harmatta rejected the identification of the Avars with the Rouran on this basis.\nAccording to Edwin G. Pulleyblank, the name Avar is the same as the prestigious name Wuhuan in the Chinese sources. Several historians, including Peter Benjamin Golden, suggest that the Avars are of Turkic origin, likely from the Oghur branch. Another theory suggests that some of the Avars were of Tungusic origin. A study by Emil Her\u0161ak and Ana Sili\u0107 (2002) suggests that the Avars were of heterogeneous origin, including mostly Turkic (Oghuric) and Mongolic groups. Later in Europe some Germanic and Slavic groups were assimilated into the Avars. Her\u0161ak and Sili\u0107 concluded that their exact origin is unknown but stated that it is likely that the Avars were originally mainly composed of Turkic (Oghuric) tribes.\nIncreasing evidence supports a relationship between the elite of the Pannonian Avars and the Inner Asian Rouran Khaganate; however it remains unclear to what extent the European Avars descent from the Rouran population. It is argued that the initial elite core of the Pannonian Avars spoke a Para-Mongolic language (Serbi-Avar), which is a sister lineage to contemporary Mongolic languages.\nSteppe empire dynamics and ethnogenesis.\nIn 2003, Walter Pohl summarized the formation of nomadic empires:\n1. Many steppe empires were founded by groups who had been defeated in previous power struggles but had fled from the dominion of the stronger group. The Avars were likely a losing faction previously subordinate to the Ashina clan in the Western Turkic Khaganate, and they fled west of the Dnieper.\n2. These groups usually were of mixed origin, and each of its components was part of a previous group.\n3. Crucial in the process was the elevation of a khagan, which signified a claim to independent power and an expansionist strategy. This group also needed a new name that would give all of its initial followers a sense of identity.\n4. The name for a new group of steppe riders was often taken from a repertoire of prestigious names which did not necessarily denote any direct affiliation to or descent from groups of the same name; in the Early Middle Ages, Huns, Avars, Bulgars, and Ogurs, or names connected with -(o)gur (Kutrigurs, Utigurs, Onogurs, etc.), were most important. In the process of name-giving, both perceptions by outsiders and self-designation played a role. These names were also connected with prestigious traditions that directly expressed political pretensions and programmes, and had to be endorsed by success. In the world of the steppe, where agglomerations of groups were rather fluid, it was vital to know how to deal with a newly-emergent power. The symbolical hierarchy of prestige expressed through names provided some orientation for friend and foe alike.\nSuch views are mirrored by Csan\u00e1d B\u00e1lint. \"The ethnogenesis of early medieval peoples of steppe origin cannot be conceived in a \"single linear\" fashion due to their great and constant mobility\", with no ethnogenetic \"point zero\", theoretical \"proto-people\" or proto-language. Moreover, Avar identity was strongly linked to Avar political institutions. Groups who rebelled or fled from the Avar realm could never be called \"Avars\", but were rather termed \"Bulgars\". Similarly, with the final demise of Avar power in the early 9th century, Avar identity disappeared almost instantaneously.\nSavelyev and Jeong (2020) in \"Early nomads of the Eastern Steppe and their tentative connections in the West\" concluded that the initial Pannonian Avars formed in Central Asia from various ethno-linguistic groups, including Iranian peoples, Ugrians, Oghur-Turks, and Rouran tribes. They further note that \"the broadly East Asian component in the archaeological record of the European Avars is limited even in the earlier period of their history; elements originating from West Asia, the Caucasus, the Southern Russian steppes and the local Central European cultures can be traced alongside each other\".\nSubsequent analyses from 2022 on Avar remains however confirmed their Ancient Northeast Asian origin, and support a possible ethnogenesis of the Avar Elite from the former Rouran Khaganate.\nAnthropology.\nIn the Stuttgart Psalter there is an image of mounted archers riding backwards on their horses, a noted \"Asian\" tactic, which may depict the Avars. According to mid-20th century physical anthropologists such as P\u00e1l Lipt\u00e1k, human remains from the early Avar (7th century) period had mostly \"Europoid\" features, while grave goods indicated cultural links to the Eurasian Steppe. Cemeteries dated to the late Avar period (8th century) included many human remains with physical features typical of East Asian people or Eurasians (i.e., people with both East Asian and European ancestry). Remains with East Asian or Eurasian features were found in about one third of the Avar graves from the 8th century. According to Lipt\u00e1k, 79% of the population of the Danube-Tisza region during the Avar period showed Europoid characteristics. However, Lipt\u00e1k used racial terms later deprecated or regarded as obsolete, such as \"Mongoloid\" for northeast Asian and \"Turanid\" for individuals of mixed ancestry. Several theories suggest that the ruling class of the Avars were of Northern East Asian origin resembling the \"Tungid type\" (common among Tungusic speaking peoples).\nArchaeogenetics.\nA genetic study published in \"Scientific Reports\" in September 2016 examined the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 31 people buried in the Carpathian Basin between the 7th and 9th centuries. They were found to be mostly carrying European haplogroups such as H, K, T and U, while about 15% carried Asian haplogroups such as C, M6, D4c1 and F1a. Their mtDNA were found to be primarily characteristic of Eastern and Southern Europe.\nA genetic study published in the \"American Journal of Physical Anthropology\" in 2018 examined 62 individuals buried in the 8th and 9th centuries at an Avar-Slavic burial in C\u00edfer\u2010P\u00e1c, Slovakia. Of the 46 samples of mtDNA extracted, 93% belonged to west Eurasian lineages, while 6% belonged to east Eurasian lineages. The amount of east Eurasian lineages was higher than among modern European populations, but lower than what has been found in other genetic studies on the Avars. The mtDNA of the examined individuals was found to be quite similar to medieval and modern Slavs, and it was suggested that the mixed population examined had emerged through intermarriage between Avar males and Slavic females.\nA genetic study published in \"Scientific Reports\" in November 2019 examined the remains of fourteen Avar males. Eleven of them were dated to the early Avar period, and three were dated to the middle and late Avar period. The eleven early Avar males were found to be carrying the paternal haplogroups N1a1a1a1a3 (four samples), N1a1a (two samples), R1a1a1b2a (two samples), C2, G2a, and I1. The three males dated to the middle and late Avar period carried the paternal haplogroups C2, N1a1a1a1a3 and E1b1b1a1b1a. In short, most carried \"East Eurasian Y haplogroups typical for modern north-eastern Siberian and Buryat populations\". The Avars studied were all determined to have had dark eyes and dark hair, and the majority of them were found to be primarily of East Asian origin.\nA genetic study published in \"Scientific Reports\" in January 2020 examined the remains of 26 individuals buried at various elite Avar cemeteries in the Pannonian Basin dated to the 7th century. The mtDNA of these Avars belonged mostly to East Asian haplogroups, while the Y-DNA was exclusively of East Asian origin and \"strikingly homogenous\", belonging to haplogroups N-M231 and Q-M242. The evidence suggests that the Avar elite were largely patrilineal and endogamous for centuries, and entered the Pannonian Basin through migrations from East Asia involving both men and women. Another 2020 study, but of Xiongnu remains in East Asia, found that the Xiongnu shared certain paternal (N1a, Q1a, R1a-Z94 and R1a-Z2124) and maternal haplotypes with the Huns and Avars, and says on this basis that they were descended from Xiongnu, who they in turn suggested were descended from Scytho-Siberians.\nA genetic study published in scientific journal \"Cell\" in April 2022 analyzed 48 Pannonian Avar samples from the early, middle and late period, and found nearly all of them to have a high level of Ancient Northeast Asian (ANA) ancestry. The paternal lineage N1a1a1a1a3a-F4205 was most common (today highest percent of haplogroup N-F4205 was found in Dukha people of Mongolia with 52.2%), with Q1a, Q1b, R1a, R1b and E1b subclades present in smaller numbers. The samples had a strong affinity with modern peoples inhabiting the region from Mongolia to the Amur, with a historical Rouran Khaganate sample, and with samples from Xiongnu-Xianbei periods in the eastern Asian steppe. The Avar individuals showed their highest genetic affinity with present-day Mongolic and Tungusic peoples, as well as Nivkhs.\nA genetic study published in scientific journal \"Current Biology\" in May 2022 examined 143 Avar samples from various periods, including Avar elites and local commoners. It confirmed the Ancient Northeast Asian (ANA) paternal and maternal origin for the Avar elite, with N1a-F4205 being their predominant and characteristic paternal lineage, alongside incorporated Q1a2a1 and R1a-Z94 Hunnic-Iranian remnants, and the rest belonging to local haplogroups found among surrounding populations. Autosomally, the Elite Avar samples \"\"preserved very ancient Mongolian pre-Bronze Age genomes, with ca 90% [Ancient North-East Asian] ancestry\", shared deep ancestry with European Huns, but although since Early Avar period started mixing with local and immigrant Hunnic-Iranian related populations, \"people with different genetic ancestries were seemingly distinguished, as samples with Hun-related genomes were buried in separate cemeteries\"\". The majority of the Avar Khaganate general population consisted of local European peoples (EU_core) but did not display Northeast Asian admixture, supporting a model of elite dominance of arriving horse nomads over a large sedentary population, with at least some subsequent admixture events. Genetic data on later Avar elite samples showed continuity with earlier Avars and the long-term presence of Northeast Asian ancestry among the Avar elite, suggesting a possible endogamous social system. There was however an increase of Northeast Asian and Saka associated ancestry among the total population, suggesting either further migration from the Eurasian Steppe and admixture between local and Avar groups, or substructure among the overall population not observed before.\nWang et al. 2025 analyzed 722 remains from the periphery of the Avar Khaganate in Austria dating to 650\u2013800 CE, specifically from sites in present-day Leobersdorf and M\u00f6dling, Lower Austria. Although both sites displayed a shared material culture, the remains from Leobersdorf displayed mostly East Asian ancestry, while the remains from M\u00f6dling displayed mostly European-like ancestry. The archaeogenetic data revealed that even after 200 years since the arrival of the 'core Avars' from present-day Mongolia, East Asian ancestry remained dominant among their elite, but apparently also among non-elite groups in periphery areas, as is the case for Leobersdorf. According to the authors, this can primarily be explained via \"systematically choosing partners with similar ancestry from other sites in the Avar realm\", until the assimilation of the Avar Khaganate into the Frankish empire starting at 800 CE, with the last Avar prince being mentioned in 822 CE. The male Avar remains from Leobersdorf carried primarily the paternal haplogroup C-M217, while a minority carried haplogroup O-M175 and haplogroup R1a, in contrast, the male remains from M\u00f6dling displayed a more heterogeneous variation, including mostly local haplogroups, and only a minority carrying haplogroup C-M217 or N1a. The authors note that \"what the evidence from Leobersdorf crucially shows is that entire groups of mostly Asian ancestry did not display elite or warrior status any more in the 8th century, and had moved out of the core area of the Avar realm\", beyond that, non-Asian locals were fully assimilated into 'Avar culture', indistinguishable in terms of material culture.\nHistory.\nArrival in Europe.\nIn 557, the Avars sent an embassy to Constantinople, presumably from the northern Caucasus. This marked their first contact with the Byzantine Empire. In exchange for gold, they agreed to subjugate the \"unruly \"gentes\"\" on behalf of the Byzantines: subsequently they conquered and incorporated various nomadic tribes\u2014Kutrigurs and Sabirs\u2014and defeated the Antes.\nBy 562 the Avars controlled the lower Danube basin and the steppes north of the Black Sea. By the time they arrived in the Balkans, the Avars formed a heterogeneous group of about 20,000 horsemen. After the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I bought them off, they pushed northwestwards into Germania. However, Frankish opposition halted the Avars' expansion in that direction. Seeking rich pastoral lands, the Avars initially demanded land south of the Danube in present-day Bulgaria, but the Byzantines refused, using their contacts with the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks as a threat against Avar aggression. The Avars turned their attention to the Carpathian Basin and to the natural defenses it afforded. The Carpathian Basin was occupied by the Gepids. In 567 the Avars formed an alliance with the Lombards\u2014enemies of the Gepids\u2014and together they destroyed much of the Gepid kingdom. The Avars then persuaded the Lombards to move into northern Italy, an invasion that marked the last Germanic mass-movement in the Migration Period.\nContinuing their successful policy of turning the various barbarians against each other, the Byzantines persuaded the Avars to attack the Sclavenes in Scythia Minor, a land rich with goods. After devastating much of the Sclavenes' land, the Avars returned to Pannonia after many of the khagan's subjects deserted to the Byzantine emperor.\nEarly Avar period (580\u2013670).\nBy about 580, the Avar Khagan Bayan I had established supremacy over most of the Slavic, Germanic and Bulgar tribes living in Pannonia and the Carpathian Basin. When the Byzantine Empire was unable to pay subsidies or hire Avar mercenaries, the Avars raided their Balkan territories. According to Menander, Bayan I commanded an army of 10,000 Kutrigur Bulgars and sacked Dalmatia in 568, effectively cutting the Byzantine terrestrial link with northern Italy and western Europe.\nIn the 580s and 590s, many of the imperial armies were busy fighting the Persians, and the remaining troops in the Balkans were no match for the Avars. By 582, the Avars had captured Sirmium, an important fort in Pannonia. When the Byzantines refused to increase the stipend amount as requested by Bayan's son and successor Bayan II, the Avars proceeded to capture Singidunum (Belgrade) and Viminacium. They suffered setbacks, however, during Maurice's Balkan campaigns in the 590s.\nBy 600 the Avars had established a nomadic empire ruling over a multitude of peoples and stretching from modern Austria in the west to the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe in the east. After being defeated at the Battles of Viminacium in their homeland, some Avars defected to the Byzantines in 602, but Emperor Maurice decided not to return home as was customary. He maintained his army camp beyond the Danube throughout the winter, but the hardship caused the army to revolt, giving the Avars a desperately needed respite and they attempted an invasion of northern Italy in 610. The Byzantine civil war prompted a Persian invasion in the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War, and after 615 the Avars enjoyed a free hand in the undefended Balkans.\nWhile negotiating with Emperor Heraclius beneath the walls of Constantinople in 617, the Avars launched a surprise attack. While they were unable to capture the city centre, they pillaged the suburbs and took 270,000 captives. Payments in gold and goods to the Avars reached a sum of 200,000 \"solidi\" shortly before 626. In 626, the Avars cooperated with the Sassanid force in the failed siege of 626. After the defeat, the political and military power of the Avars declined. Byzantine and Frankish sources documented a war between the Avars and their western Slav clients, the Wends.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Each year, the Huns [Avars] came to the Slavs, to spend the winter with them; then they took the wives and daughters of the Slavs and slept with them, and among the other mistreatments [already mentioned] the Slavs were also forced to pay levies to the Huns. But the sons of the Huns, who were [then] raised with the wives and daughters of these Wends could not finally endure this oppression anymore and refused obedience to the Huns and began, as already mentioned, a rebellion. When now the Wendish army went against the Huns, the [aforementioned] merchant Samo accompanied the same. And so Samo's bravery proved itself in wonderful ways and a huge mass of Huns fell to the sword of the Wends.\u2014\u200a\nIn the 630s, Samo, the ruler of the first Slavic polity known as Samo's Tribal Union or Samo's realm, increased his authority over lands to the north and west of the Khaganate at the expense of the Avars, ruling until his death in 658. The \"Chronicle of Fredegar\" records that during Samo's rebellion in 631, 9,000 Bulgars led by Alciocus left Pannonia to modern-day Bavaria where Dagobert I massacred most of them. The remaining 700 joined the Wends.\nAt about the time of Samo's realm, Bulgar leader Kubrat of the Dulo clan led a successful uprising to end Avar authority over the Pannonian Plain, establishing Old Great Bulgaria, or Patria Onoguria, \"the homeland of Onogurs\". The civil war, possibly a succession struggle in Onoguria between the Kutrigurs under Alciocus on one side and Utigur forces on the other, raged from 631 to 632. After Alciocus fled to Bavaria, the power of the Avars' Kutrigur forces was shattered, and Kubrat established peace between the Avars and Byzantium in 632. According to Constantine VII's 10th century work \"De Administrando Imperio,\" a group of Croats who had separated from the White Croats in White Croatia had also fought against the Avars, after which they organized the Duchy of Croatia. The Unknown Archon's people from Samo's realm were also resettled at this time.\nMiddle (670\u2013720) and late (720\u2013822) Avar periods.\nWith the death of Samo in 658 and Kubrat in 665, some Slavic tribes again came under Avar rule. Despite their father's advice, Kubrat's sons failed to maintain cohesion in Old Great Bulgaria which began to disintegrate. A few years later in the time of Batbayan, Old Great Bulgaria dissolved into five branches. From western Onoguria the first group of folk moved to Ravenna under Alzeco in the 650s. According to Book II of the \"Miracles of Saint Demetrius\", a certain Avar Chagan seized his opportunity to coalesce in the regions further north in response to the secession of the Diocese of Sirmium in the 670s by a \"Kuber\" Chagan. \n\"Finally, the (Avar) Chagan, considering them to constitute a people with an identity of its own put, in accordance to the custom of his race, a chieftain upon them, a man by the name of Kouver. When Kouver (Chagan) learned from some of his most intimate associates the desire of the exiled Romans for their ancestral homes, he gave the matter some thought, then took them together with other peoples, i.e., the foreigners who had joined them, [as is said in the Book of Moses about the Jews at the time of their exodus,] with all their baggage and arms. According to what is said, they rebelled and separated themselves from the (Avar) Chagan. The (Avar) Chagan, when he learned this, set himself in pursuit of them, met them in five or six battles and, being defeated in each one by them, took flight and retired to the regions further north. After the victory, Kouver (Chagan), together with the aforementioned people, crossed the aforementioned river Danube, came to our regions and occupied the Keramesion plain.\"\nAbout this time, \"Mark of Kalt\" records that in 677, the principality of Ungvar (Ung fortress) was established in the regions further north where Kotrag's group also fled following the chaos, and a third group of Onogur-Bulgarians led by Batayan was subdued by Ziebel's emerging Khazar Empire according to Nikephoros I of Constantinople. Under Mauros, a fourth group of folk eventually settled in the present-day region of North Macedonia. The fifth group from Onogur, Bulgaria, led by Khan Asparukh\u2014the father of Khan Tervel\u2014settled permanently along the Danube (c. 679\u2013681), establishing the First Bulgarian Empire, stabilized by the victory at the battle of Ongal south of the eastern Carpathians. The Bulgarians turned on Byzantium who had established an alliance with Ziebel's Khazars.\nAlthough the Avar empire had diminished to half its original size, the Avar-Slav alliance consolidated their rule west from the central parts of the mid-Danubian basin and extended their sphere of influence west to the Vienna Basin. The new ethnic element marked by hair clips for pigtails; curved, single-edged sabres; and broad, symmetrical bows marks the middle Avar-Bulgar period (670\u2013720). New regional centers, such as those near Ozora and Igar appeared. This strengthened the Avars' power base, although most of the Balkans lay in the hands of Slavic tribes since neither the Avars nor Byzantines were able to reassert control.\nThere are very few sources that cover the last century of Avar history. They only talk about the relations between the Avars and Lombards but little about the internals of the khaganate, so information about the Carpathian Basin is mostly from archaeology. Even here, elites are almost invisible, and there is little evidence of nomadic behavior. This transformation is little understood, but may have something to do with population growth.\nA new type of ceramics\u2014the so-called \"Dev\u00ednska Nov\u00e1 Ves\" pottery\u2014emerged at the end of the 7th century in the region between the Middle Danube and the Carpathians. These vessels were similar to the hand-made pottery of the previous period, but wheel-made items were also found in Dev\u00ednska Nov\u00e1 Ves sites. Large inhumation cemeteries found at Holiare, Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky and other places in Slovakia, Hungary and Serbia from the period beginning around 690 show that the settlement network of the Carpathian Basin became more stable in the Late Avar period. The most popular Late Avar motifs\u2014griffins and tendrils decorating belts, mounts and a number of other artifacts connected to warriors\u2014may either represent nostalgia for the lost nomadic past or evidence a new wave of nomads arriving from the Pontic steppes at the end of the 7th century. According to historians who accept the latter theory, the immigrants may have been either Onogurs or Alans. Anthropological studies of the skeletons point at the presence of a population with mongoloid features.\nIn the early 8th century, a new archaeological culture\u2014the so-called \"griffin and tendril\" culture\u2014appeared in the Carpathian Basin. Some theories, including the \"double conquest\" theory of archaeologist Gyula L\u00e1szl\u00f3, attribute it to the arrival of new settlers, such as early Magyars, but this is still under debate. Hungarian archaeologists Laszl\u00f3 Makkai and Andr\u00e1s M\u00f3csy attribute this culture to an internal evolution of Avars resulting from the integration of the Bulgar \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the previous generation of the 670s. According to Makkai and M\u00f3csy, \"the material culture\u2014art, clothing, equipment, weapons\u2014of the late Avar/Bulgar period evolved autonomously from these new foundations\". Many regions that had once been important centers of the Avar Empire had lost their significance while new ones arose. Although Avaric material culture found over much of the northern Balkans may indicate an existing Avar presence, it probably represents the presence of independent Slavs who had adopted Avaric customs. Radovan Bunard\u017ei\u0107 dated Avar-Bulgar graves excavated in \u010celarevo (near Sirmium), containing skulls with Mongolian features and Judaic symbols, to the late 8th century and 9th century.\nCollapse.\nThe gradual decline of Avar power accelerated to a rapid fall. A series of Frankish campaigns, beginning from 788, ended with the conquest of the Avar realm within a decade. Initial conflict between Avars and Franks occurred soon after the Frankish deposition of Bavarian duke Tassilo III and the establishment of direct Frankish rule over Bavaria in 788. At that time, the border between Bavarians and Avars was situated on the river Enns. An initial Avarian incursion into Bavaria was repelled, and Franco-Bavarian forces responded by taking the war to neighbouring Avarian territories, situated along the Danube, east of Enns. The two sides collided near the river Ybbs, on Ybbs Field (), where the Avars suffered a defeat in 788. This heralded the rise of Frankish power and Avarian decline in the region.\nIn 790, the Avars tried to negotiate a peace settlement with the Franks, but no agreement was reached. A Frankish campaign against the Avars, initiated in 791, ended successfully for the Franks. A large Frankish army, led by Charlemagne, crossed from Bavaria into the Avarian territory beyond the Enns, and started to advance along the Danube in two columns, but found no resistance and soon reached the region of the Vienna Woods, near the Pannonian Plain. No pitched battle was fought, since the Avars had fled before the advancing Carolingian army, while disease left most of the Avar horses dead. Tribal infighting began, showing the weakness of the khaganate.\nThe Franks had been supported by the Slavs, who established polities on former Avar territory. Charlemagne's son Pepin of Italy captured a large, fortified encampment known as \"the Ring\", which contained much of the spoils from earlier Avar campaigns. The campaign against the Avars again gathered momentum. By 796, the Avar chieftains had surrendered and became open to the acceptance of Christianity. In the meantime, all of Pannonia was conquered. According to the \"Annales Regni Francorum\", the Avars began to submit to the Franks in 796. The song \"De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica\" celebrating the defeat of the Avars at the hands of Pepin of Italy in 796 still survives. The Franks baptized many Avars and integrated them into the Frankish Empire. In 799, some Avars revolted.\nIn 804, Bulgaria conquered the southeastern Avar lands in Transylvania and southeastern Pannonia up to the Middle Danube, and many Avars became subjects of the Bulgarian Empire. Khagan Theodorus, a convert to Christianity, died after asking Charlemagne for help in 805; he was succeeded by Khagan Abraham, who was baptized as the new Frankish client (and should not be assumed from his name alone to have been Khavar rather than Pseudo-Avar). Abraham was succeeded by Khagan (or Tudun) Isaac (Latin \"Canizauci\"), about whom little is known. The Franks turned the Avar lands under their control into a frontier march. The March of Pannonia\u2014the eastern half of the Avar March\u2014was then granted to the Slavic Prince Pribina, who established the Lower Pannonia principality in 840.\nWhatever was left of Avar power was effectively ended when the Bulgars expanded their territory into the central and eastern portions of traditional Avar lands around 829. According to Pohl, an Avar presence in Pannonia is certain in 871, but thereafter the name is no longer used by chroniclers. Pohl wrote, \"It simply proved impossible to keep up an Avar identity after Avar institutions and the high claims of their tradition had failed\", although Regino wrote about them in 889. The growing amount of archaeological evidence in Transdanubia also presumes an Avar population in the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century. Archaeological findings suggest a substantial, late Avar presence on the Great Hungarian Plain; however, it is difficult to determine their proper chronology. The preliminary results of the new excavations also imply that the known and largely accepted theory of the destruction of the Avar settlement area is outdated; a disastrous depopulation of the Avar Khaganate never happened.\nByzantine records, including the \"Notitia episcopatuum\", the \"Additio patriarchicorum thronorum\" by Neilos Doxapatres, the \"Chronica\" by Petrus Alexandrinus and the \"Notitia patriarchatuum\"\" mention the 9th century Avars as an existing Christian population. The Avars had already been mixing with the more numerous Slavs for generations, and they later came under the rule of external polities, such as the Franks, Bulgaria, and Great Moravia. Fine presumes that Avar descendants who survived the Hungarian Conquest in the 890s were likely absorbed by the Hungarian population. After the mid to late 8th-century Frankish conquest of Pannonia, Avar and Bulgar refugees migrated to settle in the area of Bulgaria and along its western periphery. The Avars in the region known as \"solitudo avarorum\"\u2014currently called the Great Hungarian Plain\u2014vanished in an arc of three generations. They slowly merged with the Slavs to create a bilingual Turkic-Slavic-speaking people who were subjected to Frankish domination; the invading Magyars found this composite people in the late 9th century. The \"De Administrando Imperio\", written around 950 and based on older documents, states that \"there are still descendants of the Avars in Croatia, and are recognized as Avars\". Modern historians and archaeologists until now proved the opposite, that Avars never lived in Dalmatia proper (including Lika), that statement occurred somewhere in Pannonia, and the information belongs to the 9th century. There has been speculation that the modern Avar people of the Caucasus might have an uncertain connection to the historical Avars, but direct descent from them is rejected or doubted by many scholars.\nList of known khagans.\nThe recorded Avar khagans were:\nSocial and tribal structure.\nThe Pannonian Basin was the centre of the Avar power base. The Avars resettled captives from the peripheries of their empire to more central regions. Avar material culture is found south to Macedonia. However, to the east of the Carpathians, there are next to no Avar archaeological finds, suggesting that they lived mainly in the western Balkans. Scholars propose that a highly structured and hierarchical Avar society existed, having complex interactions with other \"barbarian\" groups. The khagan was the paramount figure, surrounded by a minority of nomadic aristocracy.\nA few exceptionally rich burials have been uncovered, confirming that power was limited to the khagan and a close-knit class of \"elite warriors\". In addition to hoards of gold coins that accompanied the burials, the men were often buried with symbols of rank, such as decorated belts, weapons, stirrups resembling those found in central Asia, as well as their horse. The Avar army was composed from numerous other groups: Slavic, Gepidic and Bulgar military units. There also appeared to have existed semi-independent \"client\" (predominantly Slavic) tribes which served strategic roles, such as engaging in diversionary attacks and guarding the Avars' western borders abutting the Frankish Empire.\nInitially, the Avars and their subjects lived mostly separately. Eventually, the Germanic and Slavic peoples were included in the Avaric social order and culture, which was Persian-Byzantine in fashion. Scholars have identified a fused Avar-Slavic culture, characterized by ornaments such as half-moon-shaped earrings, Byzantine-styled buckles, beads, and bracelets with horn-shaped ends. Paul Fouracre notes, \"[T]here appears in the seventh century a mixed Slavic-Avar material culture, interpreted as peaceful and harmonious relationships between Avar warriors and Slavic peasants. It is thought possible that at least some of the leaders of the Slavic tribes could have become part of the Avar aristocracy\". Apart from the assimilated Gepids, a few graves of Carolingian peoples have been found in the Avar lands. They perhaps served as mercenaries.\nConsistently described as a nomad society by the 19th and 20th century historians, this label is being challenged recently by archeological findings which show a more complex image, with signs of sedentarism and pastoralism such as bones of cows, pigs, or fowls, or tools used for harvesting crops such as sickles found in Avar burials in the Carpathian Basin.\nLanguage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nThe language or languages spoken by the Avars are unknown. Classical philologist Samu Sz\u00e1deczky-Kardoss said that most of the Avar words used in contemporaneous Latin or Greek texts appear to have their origins in possibly Mongolian or Turkic languages. Other theories propose a Tungusic origin. According to Sz\u00e1deczky-Kardoss, many of the titles and ranks used by the Pannonian Avars were also used by Turks, Proto-Bulgars, Uighurs and/or Mongols, including \"khagan\" (or \"kagan\"), \"khan, kapkhan, tudun, tarkhan\", and \"khatun\". There is evidence, however, that ruling and subject clans spoke a variety of languages. Proposals by scholars include Caucasian, Iranian, Tungusic, Hungarian and Turkic.\nHistorian Gyula L\u00e1szl\u00f3 has suggested that the late 9th-century Pannonian Avars spoke a variety of Old Hungarian, thereby forming an Avar-Hungarian continuity with then-newly arrived Hungarians. Based on archeologic and linguistic data, Florin Curta and Johanna Nichols considered that there is no convincing evidence for the presence of any Turkic or Mongolic languages among the Avars, but evidence for the presence of Iranian languages, further strengthened by Iranian-derived loanwords and toponyms in the region and among languages within the range of the Avars. Shimunek (2017) proposes that the elite core of the Avars spoke a \"Para-Mongolic language\" of the \"Serbi\u2013Awar\" group, that is a sister branch of the Mongolic languages. Together, the Serbi\u2013Awar and Mongolic languages make up the \"Serbi\u2013Mongolic\" languages.\nSome scholars like Omeljan Pritsak, Horace Lunt, Florin Curta speculate that Proto-Slavic became the lingua franca of the Avar Khaganate, which helped spreading the Slavic language in the Southeastern Europe. This assumption is problematic for several reasons, as Alan Timberlake notes that there was no \"radical loss of grammar that accompanies creolization\" and that neither the Avars nor the Slavs had specific social and economical mechanisms for spreading a \"lingua franca\". Jouko Lindstedt asserts that Late Proto-Slavic/Common Slavic had a complex morphological and accentological system and therefore \"shows no trace of a possible lingua-franca function\".\nWarfare.\nThe Avars were skilled warriors and almost exclusively fought on horseback. They often used light horse archers armed with powerful composite bows, as many other steppe peoples. These archers wore little to no armour, besides occasional helmets or knee guards. The Avars also employed the use of heavy cavalry, fully armoured in chainmail or scale armour as well as helmets. These heavier troops were armed with long lances, swords, and daggers. Upon subjugating the Slavic tribes in Pannonia, they often allied with the Slavs and employed them as foot soldiers even together laying siege to Constantinople, along with large numbers of Persians. These Slav warriors were usually armed with bows, axes, various types of spears, and round shields.\nThe Byzantine Emperor Maurice wrote of the Avars and other nomad peoples in the Strategikon:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"They give special attention to training in archery on horseback. A vast herd of male and female horses follows them, both to provide nourishment and to give the impression of a huge army. They do not encamp within entrenchments, as do the Persians and the Romans [Byzantines], but until the day of battle, spread about according to tribes and clans, they continuously graze their horses both summer and winter... Also in the event of battle, when opposed by an infantry force in close formation they stay on their horses and do not dismount, for they do not last long fighting on foot. They have been brought up on horseback, and owing to their lack of exercise they simply cannot walk about on their own feet... \"\u2014\u200a\nAvar-Hungarian continuity theory.\nGyula L\u00e1szl\u00f3 says that the late Avars, arriving in the khaganate in 670 in great numbers, lived through the time between the destruction and plunder of the Avar state by the Franks during 791\u2013795 and the arrival of the Magyars in 895. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 points out that the settlements of the Hungarians (Magyars) complemented, rather than replaced, those of the Avars. Avars remained on the plough fields, good for agriculture, while Hungarians took the river banks and river flats, suitable for pasturage. He notes that while the Hungarian graveyards consist of 40\u201350 graves on average, those of the Avars contain 600\u20131,000. According to these findings, the Avars not only survived the end of the Avar polity but lived in great masses and far outnumbered the Hungarian conquerors of \u00c1rp\u00e1d.\nHe also shows that Hungarians occupied only the centre of the Carpathian basin, while Avars lived in a larger territory. Looking at those territories where only the Avars lived, there are only Hungarian geographical names, not Slavic or Turkic as would be expected interspersed among them. This is further evidence for the Avar-Hungarian continuity. Names of the Hungarian tribes, chieftains and the words used for the leaders, etc., suggest that at least the leaders of the Hungarian conquerors were Turkic-speaking. However, Hungarian is not a Turkic language but Uralic, so they must have been assimilated by the Avars who outnumbered them.\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3's Avar-Hungarian continuity theory posits that the modern Hungarian language descends from that spoken by the Avars rather than the conquering Magyars. Based on DNA evidence from graves, the original Magyars most resembled modern Volga Tatars, a Turkic people located in the Volga-Ural region, whereas the Khanty and Mansi, whose languages most resemble Hungarian, live some ways to the northeast of the Volga Tatars.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Blood vessels transport blood cells, nutrients, and oxygen to most of the tissues of a body, and also transport waste products and carbon dioxide away from the tissues. Some tissues \u2013 such as cartilage, epithelium, and the lens and cornea of the eye \u2013 are not supplied with blood vessels, so are termed \"avascular\".\nThere are five types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the arterioles; the capillaries, where the exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and tissues occurs; the venules; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back towards the heart.\nThe word, \"vascular\", is derived from the Latin \"vas\", meaning \"vessel\", and is used in reference to blood vessels.\nEtymology.\nartery \u2013 late Middle English; from Latin \"arteria\", from Greek \"art\u0113ria\", probably derived from \"airein\" (\"raise\").\nvein \u2013 Middle English; from Old French \"veine\", from Latin \"vena\".\ncapillary \u2013 mid-17th century; from Latin \"capillaris\", from \"capillus\" (\"hair\"), influenced by Old French \"capillaire\".\nStructure.\nThe arteries and veins have three layers. The middle layer is thicker in the arteries than it is in the veins:\nCapillaries consist of a single layer of endothelial cells with a supporting subendothelium consisting of a basement membrane and connective tissue. When blood vessels connect to form a region of diffuse vascular supply, it is called an anastomosis. Anastomoses provide alternative routes for blood to flow through in case of blockages. Veins can have valves that prevent the backflow of the blood that was being pumped against gravity by the surrounding muscles. In humans, arteries do not have valves except for the two 'arteries' that originate from the heart's ventricles.\nEarly estimates by Danish physiologist August Krogh suggested that the total length of capillaries in human muscles could reach approximately (assuming a high muscle mass human body, like that of a bodybuilder). However, later studies suggest a more conservative figure of taking into account updated capillary density and average muscle mass in adults.\nTypes.\nThere are various kinds of blood vessels:\nThey are roughly grouped as \"arterial\" and \"venous\", determined by whether the blood in it is flowing \"away from\" (arterial) or \"toward\" (venous) the heart. The term \"arterial blood\" is nevertheless used to indicate blood high in oxygen, although the pulmonary artery carries \"venous blood\" and blood flowing in the pulmonary vein is rich in oxygen. This is because they are carrying the blood to and from the lungs, respectively, to be oxygenated.\nFunction.\nBlood vessels function to transport blood to an animal's body tissues. In general, arteries and arterioles transport oxygenated blood from the lungs to the body and its organs, and veins and venules transport deoxygenated blood from the body to the lungs. Blood vessels also circulate blood throughout the circulatory system. Oxygen (bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells) is the most critical nutrient carried by the blood. In all arteries apart from the pulmonary artery, hemoglobin is highly saturated (95\u2013100%) with oxygen. In all veins, apart from the pulmonary vein, the saturation of hemoglobin is about 75%. (The values are reversed in the pulmonary circulation.) In addition to carrying oxygen, blood also carries hormones, and nutrients to the cells of a body and removes waste products.\nBlood vessels do not actively engage in the transport of blood (they have no appreciable peristalsis). Blood is propelled through arteries and arterioles through pressure generated by the heartbeat. Blood vessels also transport red blood cells. Hematocrit tests can be performed to calculate the proportion of red blood cells in the blood. Higher proportions result in conditions such as dehydration or heart disease, while lower proportions could lead to anemia and long-term blood loss.\nPermeability of the endothelium is pivotal in the release of nutrients to the tissue. It is also increased in inflammation in response to histamine, prostaglandins and interleukins, which leads to most of the symptoms of inflammation (swelling, redness, warmth and pain).\nConstriction.\nArteries\u2014and veins to a degree\u2014can regulate their inner diameter by contraction of the muscular layer. This changes the blood flow to downstream organs and is determined by the autonomic nervous system. Vasodilation and vasoconstriction are also used antagonistically as methods of thermoregulation.\nThe size of blood vessels is different for each of them. It ranges from a diameter of about 30\u201325 millimeters for the aorta to only about 5 micrometers (0,005mm) for the capillaries. Vasoconstriction is the constriction of blood vessels (narrowing, becoming smaller in cross-sectional area) by contracting the vascular smooth muscle in the vessel walls. It is regulated by vasoconstrictors (agents that cause vasoconstriction). These can include paracrine factors (e.g., prostaglandins), a number of hormones (e.g., vasopressin and angiotensin) and neurotransmitters (e.g., epinephrine) from the nervous system.\nVasodilation is a similar process mediated by antagonistically acting mediators. The most prominent vasodilator is nitric oxide (termed endothelium-derived relaxing factor for this reason).\nFlow.\nThe circulatory system uses the channel of blood vessels to deliver blood to all parts of the body. This is a result of the left and right sides of the heart working together to allow blood to flow continuously to the lungs and other parts of the body. Oxygen-poor blood enters the right side of the heart through two large veins. Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs enters through the pulmonary veins on the left side of the heart into the aorta and then reaches the rest of the body. The capillaries are responsible for allowing the blood to receive oxygen through tiny air sacs in the lungs. This is also the site where carbon dioxide exits the blood. This all occurs in the lungs where blood is oxygenated.\nThe blood pressure in blood vessels is traditionally expressed in millimetres of mercury (1 mmHg = 133 Pa). In the arterial system, this is usually around 120 mmHg systolic (high pressure wave due to contraction of the heart) and 80 mmHg diastolic (low pressure wave). In contrast, pressures in the venous system are constant and rarely exceed 10 mmHg.\nVascular resistance occurs when the vessels away from the heart oppose the flow of blood. Resistance is an accumulation of three different factors: blood viscosity, blood vessel length and vessel radius. Blood viscosity is the thickness of the blood and its resistance to flow as a result of the different components of the blood. Blood is 92% water by weight and the rest of blood is composed of protein, nutrients, electrolytes, wastes, and dissolved gases. Depending on the health of an individual, the blood viscosity can vary (i.e., anemia causing relatively lower concentrations of protein, high blood pressure an increase in dissolved salts or lipids, etc.).\nVessel length is the total length of the vessel measured as the distance away from the heart. As the total length of the vessel increases, the total resistance as a result of friction will increase. Vessel radius also affects the total resistance as a result of contact with the vessel wall. As the radius of the wall gets smaller, the proportion of the blood making contact with the wall will increase. The greater amount of contact with the wall will increase the total resistance against the blood flow.\nDisease.\nBlood vessels play a huge role in virtually every medical condition. Cancer, for example, cannot progress unless the tumor causes angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) to supply the malignant cells' metabolic demand. Atherosclerosis represents around 85% of all deaths from cardiovascular diseases due to the buildup of plaque. Coronary artery disease that often follows after atherosclerosis can cause heart attacks or cardiac arrest, resulting in 370,000 worldwide deaths in 2022. In 2019, around 17.9 million people died from cardiovascular diseases. Of these deaths, around 85% of them were due to heart attack and stroke.\nBlood vessel permeability is increased in inflammation. Damage, due to trauma or spontaneously, may lead to hemorrhage due to mechanical damage to the vessel endothelium. In contrast, occlusion of the blood vessel by atherosclerotic plaque, an embolised blood clot or a foreign body leads to downstream ischemia (insufficient blood supply) and possibly infarction (necrosis due to lack of blood supply). Vessel occlusion tends to be a positive feedback system; an occluded vessel creates eddies in the normally laminar flow or plug flow blood currents. These eddies create abnormal fluid velocity gradients which push blood elements, such as cholesterol or chylomicron bodies, to the endothelium. These deposit onto the arterial walls which are already partially occluded and build upon the blockage.\nThe most common disease of the blood vessels is hypertension or high blood pressure. This is caused by an increase in the pressure of the blood flowing through the vessels. Hypertension can lead to heart failure and stroke. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots and can also help limit inflammation. Vasculitis is inflammation of the vessel wall due to autoimmune disease or infection.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These were unpopular as they provided little grip and turning capability and the experience was similar to skiing across ice.\nHowever, in present day, many ski slopes (both indoor and outdoor) continue to use plastic, injection moulded tiles. Quality has improved and many dry ski slopes in the Netherlands use these tiles for training and championships.\nBrush materials.\nThe next stage in dry ski slope development came with the brush industry. The most common material is Dendix which is a by-product of brush manufacturing and is similar to a short-haired brush with the bristles sticking upwards. Dendix is manufactured in Chepstow, however it can be found on slopes throughout the world. It is arranged in a hexagonal pattern of approximately strips of bristles in a hexagon. Although it was a significant advancement from previous surfaces, concern over damage to slope users (it provides little or no impact protection to a slope user when falling) and ski or snowboard damage due to friction meant litigation for slopes using it was a constant threat. Nowadays water is often sprayed onto the surface of the dendix to lubricate it and increase speed; however, higher insurance premiums cause many slope operators to look for safer alternatives.\nDespite more recent materials, Dendix remains the most popular plastic slope material in use.\nRecent materials.\nThe most recent development has seen a crop of materials providing both impact protection and slope lubrication as well as the ability to perform turns, erect jumps, rails and quarterpipes and provide a ride that is closer to the feel of real snow. http:// is one of these, a newer material whose use is becoming even more common. This new type of mat, which uses a concentric arrangement of conical stems, is marketed for downhill, snowboarding and cross country skiing. Neveplast claims to be certified as having the same coefficient of friction between the surface and the ski as snow, allowing the skier a good side grip, with the same skis used on the snow, and without the need for water. The Neveplast cooling hole has a comparable diameter to the F.I.S. slalom pole standards used for training and competition in both slalom and giant slalom. Neveplast is also used for school camps. This surface is modular and flexible, used frequently also for Urban freestyle parks.\nA German provider that guarantees year round skiing is http://. The company does not only produce dry slopes for downhill skiing, snowboarding and cross country skiing but also provides tubing tracks and rental opportunities for events. The material of Mr. Snow is claimed to have very good sliding capacities, is predictable in all climates and does not harm the ski or sliding surface. Mr. Snow works without the use of silicone which is not necessary to achieve good sliding characteristics. The snow carpet evidently has no negative environmental impact, so the mats can remain on the surface 365 days a year.\nIt is also possible to remove them very quickly if it is required. Temporary using can be realized with the 20 sqm modules.\nAnother very common mat is Snowflex, manufactured near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire in England by Briton Engineering Developments Limited. Others include Perma-snow by John Nike Leisure/ Techmat 2000, also in the UK and Astroride by NorCal Extreme Sports in the United States. Snowflex and Perma-snow are both white in colour, although the former has been produced in a darker green (such as in Kendal Ski Club in Cumbria, England) to comply with planning requirements. There is no indication from NorCal Extreme Sports that AstroRide has been commercially tested to any great extent. \nThe latest arrival is from UK company Proslope who produce a matting with variable filament lengths to emulate the gradual edge grip and release of snow. As with some other surfaces, the system is coloured white, is modular, and works both with and without a misting system.\nA type of Enoki mushroom dry ski slope surface from China. Countless thin strips with round balls on the top, resembling a mushroom-like shape, make the surface of the run-in slopes of the Training Centre airbag jumps differently from other dry slope surfaces in terms of sliding effect and safety. Its structure, friction, elasticity, safety protection, and simulation effect provide an ideal surface for airbag beginners and high-performance athletes. The surface allows the rider to either carve or skid to aid in speed control or line choice. It is possible to turn on the surface quite well, but the aim is to maintain a low edge angle and make small adjustments to create speed or set your line. This type of dry ski mat appeared for the first time at a FIS World Cup competition.\nSki and board preparation.\nDry slope users often improve the performance of their equipment by using the hardest grade of ski wax. The wax wears off quickly, however, and must be renewed after one or two sessions. At least one company makes a hard wax that is intended for use on dry slopes. Some users apply aerosol furniture polish or other can-based products to the bases of their skis or boards as the silicone oil it contains is reputed to reduce friction. Other substances, such as dishwashing liquid, are sometimes used.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Nicknamed \"el Chueco\" and \"el Maestro\", Fangio won five Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles and\u2014at the time of his retirement\u2014held the record for most wins (24), pole positions (29), fastest laps (23), and podium finishes (35), among others.\nFrom childhood, he abandoned his studies to pursue auto mechanics. In 1938, he debuted in the newly-formed Argentine stock car racing series Turismo Carretera, competing in a Ford V8. In 1940, he competed with Chevrolet, winning the Grand Prix International Championship and devoted his time to the Turismo Carretera becoming its champion, a title he successfully defended a year later. Fangio then competed in Europe between 1947 and 1949, where he achieved further success.\nOne of the most successful drivers in Formula One history, he made his debut in the inaugural Formula One season in 1950 to dominate the first decade of the championship. He went on to win the World Drivers' Championship five times\u2014a record that stood for 46 years\u2014and became the only driver in F1 history to win titles with four different teams: Alfa Romeo (1951), Maserati (1954 and 1957), Mercedes-Benz (1954 and 1955), and Ferrari (1956). He holds the highest winning percentage in Formula One at 46.15%, winning 24 of 52 Formula One races he entered. Additionally, Fangio also holds the record for the highest pole percentage at 55.77%, achieving 29 pole positions from 52 entries. Fangio is the only Argentine driver to have won the World Drivers' Championship and the Argentine Grand Prix. He also competed in sports car racing, winning the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1956 with Ferrari and in 1957 with Maserati.\nAfter retirement, Fangio presided as the honorary president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina from 1987, a year after the inauguration of his museum, until his death in 1995. In 2011, on the centenary of his birth, Fangio was remembered around the world and various activities were held in his honor.\nEarly life.\nFangio's grandfather, Giuseppe Fangio, emigrated to Buenos Aires from Italy in 1887. Giuseppe was able to buy his own farm near Balcarce, a small town near Mar del Plata in southern Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, within three years by making charcoal from tree branches. Giuseppe brought his family, with his 7-year son Loreto, later the racing driver's father, to Argentina from the small central Italian town of Castiglione Messer Marino in the Chieti province of the Abruzzo region. His mother, Herminia D\u00e9ramo, was from Tornareccio, slightly to the north. Fangio's parents married on 24 October 1903 and lived on farms, where Herminia was a housekeeper and Loreto worked in the building trade, becoming an apprentice stonemason.\nFangio was born in Balcarce on 24 June 1911, San Juan's Day, at 12:10\u00a0am. His birth certificate was mistakenly dated 23 June in the Register of Balcarce. He was the fourth of six children. In his childhood he became known as \"El Chueco\", the bandy-legged one, for his skill in bending his left leg around the ball to shoot on goal in football games.\nFangio started his education at School No. 4 of Balcarce, before transferring to School No. 1 and 18 Uriburu Av. When Fangio was 13, he dropped out of school and worked in Miguel Angel Casas auto mechanics' workshop as an assistant mechanic. When he was 16, he started riding as a mechanic for his employer's customers. He developed pneumonia that almost proved fatal, after a football game where hard running had caused a sharp pain in his chest. He was bed-ridden for two months, cared for by his mother.\nAfter recovering, Fangio served compulsory military service at the age of 21. In 1932 he was enlisted at the Campo de Mayo cadet school near Buenos Aires. His driving skills caught the attention of his commanding officer, who appointed Fangio as his official driver. Fangio was discharged before his 22nd birthday, after taking his final physical examination. He returned to Balcarce where he aimed to further his football career. Along with his friend Jos\u00e9 Duffard he received offers to play at a club based in Mar del Plata. Their teammates at Balcarce suggested the two work on Fangio's hobby of building his own car, and his parents gave him space to do so in a rudimentary shed at the family home.\nEarly racing career.\nAfter finishing his military service, Fangio opened his own garage and raced in local events. He began his racing career in Argentina in 1936, driving a 1929 Ford Model\u00a0A that he had rebuilt. In the Tourismo Carretera category, Fangio participated in his first race between 18 and 30 October 1938 as the co-driver of Luis Finocchietti. Despite not winning the Argentine Road Grand Prix, Fangio drove most of the way and finished fifth. In November of that year, he entered the \"400\u00a0km of Tres Arroyos\", but it was suspended due to a fatal accident.\nDuring his time racing in Argentina, he drove Chevrolet cars and was Argentine National Champion in 1940 and 1941. One particular race, the 1940 Gran Premio del Norte, was almost 10,000\u00a0km (6,250\u00a0mi) long, one that Fangio described as a \"terrible ordeal\". This rally-style race started in Buenos Aires on 27 September, and ran up through the Andes and Bolivia to Lima, Peru, and then back to Buenos Aires, taking 15 days, ending on 12 October with stages held each day. This horrendously gruelling race was held in the most difficult and varied conditions imaginable\u2014drivers had to traverse through hot and dry deserts, insect-ridden jungles with crushing humidity, freezing cold and sometimes snowy mountain passes with cliff drops at extremely high altitude, sometimes in total darkness, and cold, highly elevated deserts such as the Atacama- all on a mixture of dirt and paved roads- none of which were closed off to the public. Early in the race Fangio hit a large rock and damaged the car's driveshaft, which was replaced in the next town. Later on at an overnight stop in Bolivia one of the townspeople crashed into Fangio's car and bent an axle\u2014he and his co-driver spent all night fixing it. Following this repair the fan blade got loose and punctured the radiator, which meant another repair before it was later replaced. They drove through scorching desert with no water, and during a night stint one of the headlights fell off and they had to be secured with his co-driver's necktie. The weather in the Andes mountains and the Atacama was so cold that Fangio drove with his co-driver's arms around him for hours. These mountainous routes in Bolivia and Peru sometimes involved going up to altitudes of above sea level\u2014a 40 percent reduction of air thickness, making breathing incredibly difficult and the engine being severely down on power. When Fangio finally got out of the mountains and back to Buenos Aires, after traversing all these external challenges, he had won the race, which was his first big victory.\nIn 1941, he beat Oscar G\u00e1lvez in the Grand Prix Get\u00falio Vargas in Brazil, which was a six-day, public road race starting from and ending at Rio de Janeiro, going through various cities and towns all over Brazil such as S\u00e3o Paulo and Belo Horizonte. For the second time, Fangio was crowned champion of Argentine TC. In 1942, he took tenth place in the South Grand Prix. In April he won the race \"Mar y Sierras\", and then had to suspend activity due to World War II. In 1946, Fangio returned to racing with two races in Mor\u00f3n and Tandil driving a Ford\u00a0T. In February 1947, Fangio competed at National Mechanics (MN) at the Retiro circuit, and on 1 March, he started the race for Rosario City Award. Subsequently, Fangio triumphed in the Double Back Window Race.\nIn October 1948, Fangio however suffered a personal tragedy in another gruelling race, this time 1948 South American Grand Prix, another point-to-point race from Buenos Aires to Caracas, Venezuela\u2014a 20-day event covering a distance of through Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and finally Venezuela. In a race that killed 3 spectators and 2 drivers. Fangio, with his co-driver Daniel Urrutia battled hard with brothers Juan and Oscar Galvez, and Domingo Marimon throughout- Fangio was pushing hard to make up lost time he incurred in Argentina. On the 10th day, on the Lima to Tumbes stage in northern Peru, on coastal roads along the Pacific Ocean, Fangio was driving at night in thick fog generated from the ocean in near-pitch black darkness when he approached a left-hand bend at near the village of Huanchaco, not far from the small city of Trujillo. With his car's lights not helping him in the thick fog, he approached the bend too fast, lost control of the car and tumbled down an embankment, and Urrutia was thrown out of the car through the front windscreen. Oscar Galvez stopped to help Fangio, who had neck injuries, then soon found the badly injured Urrutia. Another competitor, Luciano Marcilla, stopped and took Fangio and Urrutia to the nearest hospital in the town of Chocope 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) away. Fangio survived but 35-year-old Urrutia did not, suffering multiple fatal cervical and basal skull fractures. Domingo Marimon won the race, but the race was a disaster and was marred by the deaths of three spectators and three drivers (including Urrutia). Fangio believed he would never race again and entered a depressed state after the death of his friend, but he recovered, and his successes in Argentina caught the attention of the Argentine Automobile Club and the Juan Peron-led Argentine government, so they bought a Maserati and sent him to Europe in December 1948 to continue his career.\nFormula One and sports car racing.\nOverview.\nFangio was the oldest driver in many of his Formula One races, having started his Grand Prix career in his late 30s. During his career, drivers raced with almost no protective equipment on circuits with no safety features. Formula One cars in the 1950s were for the time not only fast, but very physically and mentally demanding to drive; races were much longer than today and demanded incredible stamina. Tyres were very narrow and cross-ply, and far less forgiving; treads often stripped in a race, and spark plugs fouled. The drivers wore goggles with cloth helmets up to 1952, where from that year on helmets were made mandatory, so they wore pie-shaped crash hats made of paper-mache. The cars had no seatbelts, no roll-over protection, no bodywork to contain the driver (up until 1954) and the front-engined layout of these cars meant that the heated air from the engine and the gearbox would often blast the bodies of the drivers for the hours of the race, with the driveshaft spinning between their legs, and there were, of course, no electronic aids or computer intervention. At the end of a GP, drivers often suffered blistered hands caused by heavy steering and gear changing, and their faces were sometimes covered in soot from the inboard brakes. Despite Fangio's short career, he was one of the top GP drivers in history, rivalling Tazio Nuvolari.\nFangio had no compunction about leaving a team, even after a successful year or even during a season, if he thought he would have a better chance with a better car. As was then common, several of his race results were shared with teammates after he took over their car during races when his own had technical problems. His main rivals included Alberto Ascari and Stirling Moss, and on occasion Giuseppe \u201cNino\u201d Farina and Mike Hawthorn (Farina particularly in the early part of Fangio\u2019s career). Throughout his career, Fangio was backed by funding from the Argentine government of Juan Per\u00f3n.\nWorld championship successes.\nFangio's first Grand Prix race was the 1948 French Grand Prix at Reims, where he started his Simca Gordini from 11th on the grid but retired. Fangio briefly returned to South America to compete in the aforementioned Buenos Aires to Caracas race, he then returned to Europe the following year, and raced in Sanremo; having upgraded to a Maserati 4CLT/48 sponsored by the Automobile Club of Argentina he dominated the event, winning both heats to take the aggregate win by almost a minute over Prince Bira. Fangio entered a further six Grand Prix races in 1949, winning four of them against top-level opposition.\nAlfa Romeo and Monza accident.\nFor the first World Championship of Drivers in 1950, Fangio was taken on by the Alfa Romeo team alongside Farina and Luigi Fagioli. With competitive racing cars following the Second World War still in short supply, the pre-war Alfettas proved dominant. Fangio won each of the three races he finished at Monaco, Spa and Reims-Gueux but Farina's three wins at races Fangio retired from and a fourth-place allowed Farina to take the title, even though Fangio was quicker than Farina, who was able to take advantage of Fangio's mechanical woes. Fangio's most notable victory that year was at Monaco, where he dodged a multi-car pile-up and easily won the race. In 1950s non-championship races Fangio took a further four wins at San Remo, Pau and the fearsome Coppa Acerbo at the 16-mile Pescara public road circuit, and two seconds from eight starts. At Pescara in 1950, going down a long straight called the Flying Kilometer, he was clocked doing 194\u00a0mph (310\u00a0km/h) in his Alfa. He also won a handful of races in South America for the Argentine Automobile Club driving a Maserati 4CLT and a Ferrari 166 during the European off-season.\nFangio won three more championship races for Alfa in 1951 in the Swiss, French and Spanish Grands Prix, and with the new 4.5-litre Ferraris taking points off his teammates Farina and various others, Fangio took the title at the final race in Spain, finishing six points ahead of Ascari at the Pedralbes street circuit. Fangio also finished second at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone after his horrendously fuel-inefficient Alfa had to make two lengthy pit stops to refill the car. He then finished second at the German Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring after he lost first and second gear during an intense battle with Alberto Ascari.\nWith the 1952 World Championship being run to Formula Two specifications, Alfa Romeo did not have a car for the new formula and were unable to use their supercharged Alfettas, so they withdrew. As a result, the defending champion found himself without a car for the first race of the championship and remained absent from F1 until June, when he drove the British BRM V16 in non-championship F1 races at the public road circuits at Albi in France and Dundrod in Northern Ireland. Fangio had agreed to drive for Maserati in a non-championship race at Monza the day after the Dundrod race, but having missed a connecting flight he decided to drive through the night on pre-motorway mountain roads through the Alps from Lyon, arriving half an hour before the start. Arriving at Monza at 2 p.m., he was badly fatigued and with the race starting at 2:30\u00a0p.m., Fangio started the race from the back of the grid but lost control on the second lap, crashed into a grass bank, and was thrown out of the car as it flipped end over end, smashing through trees. He was taken to a hospital in Milan with multiple injuries, the most serious being a broken neck, and spent the rest of 1952 recovering in Argentina. Nino Farina, who had won the race, visited Fangio in hospital and gifted him with the winner's laurel wreath.\nMaserati and sports car racing successes.\nHaving returned to Europe and back to full racing fitness in 1953, Fangio rejoined Maserati for the championship season, and against the dominant Ferraris led by Ascari he took a lucky win at Monza. Fangio's car had a bad vibration all throughout practice, and he offered the Maserati mechanics 10% of his winnings if they fixed the vibration; they did, and Fangio qualified second, and won the race, setting fastest lap and beating Nino Farina by just 1.4 seconds. Along with that win, Fangio secured three second-places to finish second in the Championship, and also came third first time out in the Targa Florio. He also competed and won one of two heats in the Albi Grand Prix, again with BRM and driving the fearsome and powerful Type 15, a car with a 600\u00a0hp supercharged V16 that was difficult to drive.\nHe also competed in one of the most dangerous and prestigious races in Europe: the Mille Miglia, a race on open public roads covering nearly all of northern Italy driving an Alfa Romeo 6C 3000 CM entered by the factory. The Mille Miglia and also another championship race in 1953, the Carrera Panamericana in Mexico were much like the races he competed in South America in the 1940s (except all the roads used in Italy and Mexico were paved). At the Mille Miglia, the Alfa team was expected to win, and after Farina, Karl Kling and Consalvo Sanesi all crashed, Fangio was leading when he reached Rome, pushing very hard from when he started in Brescia. Fangio then suffered left front steering arm failure near Bologna and only had consistent steering on the right front; this allowed Mille Miglia expert Giannino Marzotto to catch and beat Fangio by 12 minutes, even though the Argentine driver drove hard to keep up with Marzotto. He ended 1953 by winning the dauntingly dangerous and difficult 2,000\u00a0mi (3,200\u00a0km) Carrera Panamericana in Mexico driving a Lancia D24; Fangio was able to win this 5-day open public road rally that started at the Guatemala-Mexico border and ended at the Mexico-United States border in Ciudad Juarez, setting a new race time completion record of 18.5 hours (despite Fangio not winning a single stage), some 9 hours faster than the winner of the first event in 1950. The race was marred by multiple spectator fatalities, and the death of 50-year-old Felice Bonetto, like Fangio driving a works Lancia, on the third day of the competition in the town of Silao.\nMercedes-Benz.\nIn 1954 Fangio raced for Maserati until Mercedes-Benz entered competition in mid-season. He won his home Grand Prix in Buenos Aires and at Spa with the iconic 250F. Mercedes-Benz's first race was the French Grand Prix at the fast, straight dominated Reims public road circuit, and he won the race with the streamlined, closed-wheel W196 Monoposto- a car that although difficult to drive was ahead of its time. Fangio spent the race battling with teammate Karl Kling down Reims's long straights. Fangio failed to win at Silverstone, with the closed-wheel car designed for straight-line speed struggling at the high speed corner-dominated circuit. Fangio got the more nimble open-wheeled W196 for the N\u00fcrburgring, and won the race, as he did at Bremgarten and then at Monza, the latter with the streamlined car. Monza was a particularly brutal race in that Alberto Ascari had turned up with the new Lancia, and young British up-and-comer Stirling Moss in a private Maserati was also competitive during the race. Ascari and Moss both passed Fangio and raced each other hard until Ascari dropped out with engine problems. Moss's engine blew up near the end of the race and Fangio took victory. Winning eight out of twelve races (six out of eight in the championship) and winning his second championship in that year, he continued to race with Mercedes\u2014driving a further developed W196 with improved performance in 1955 in a team that included Moss.\nFor 1955, Fangio subjected himself to a training programme which was strenuous in an effort to keep up his fitness levels high which was comparable to his younger rivals. He won a particularly brutal race at the Gran Premio de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina. This race was run in Buenos Aires during a gruelling heat wave, and with track temperature of over few drivers other than Fangio were able to complete the race. The W196's chassis had heated up and Fangio's right leg rubbed against the chassis structure, but even after receiving severe burns he kept going; it took him three months to recover from his injuries. 1955 also saw Fangio attempt the Mille Miglia again, this time without a navigator, driving a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR. After leaving at 6:58\u00a0a.m., the car's advanced engine began developing problems when he got to Pescara. The Mercedes mechanics apparently found nothing, and sent him off. Fangio was losing time to Moss and Hans Herrmann, and when he got to Rome the engine was still not running smoothly. Again Fangio was sent away by the mechanics. And when he got to Florence, a few loud bangs were heard, so the mechanics raised the bonnet and they found that one of the fuel injection pipes had broken, so Fangio's 300 SLR was running on seven cylinders instead of eight; this could not be repaired and Fangio drove back to Brescia with a misfiring engine, finishing in 2nd behind Moss. Fangio later surmised that Mercedes felt he could not win the race without a navigator so they did not put as much effort behind preparing his car as they did with the car of Moss, who had a navigator. At the end of the second successful season (which was overshadowed by the 1955 Le Mans disaster in which 83 spectators were killed, an accident which happened right in front of and nearly killed him) Mercedes withdrew from racing and after four attempts, Fangio never raced at Le Mans again. A number of races were cancelled after this race except for Britain and Italy (which both already had circuits with new and updated safety facilities), which he finished in second in the former and won the latter, allowing him to win his third world championship. Mercedes's last race was the Targa Florio sportscar race, which Mercedes needed to win in order to beat Ferrari and Jaguar to the title; the German firm had skipped the first two races in Buenos Aires and Sebring, Florida. Fangio, driving with Kling finished second to Moss and Peter Collins, allowing Mercedes to win the title by two points over Ferrari.\nLast years with Ferrari and Maserati.\nIn 1956 Fangio moved to Ferrari to win his fourth title. Neither Enzo Ferrari nor the Ferrari team manager Eraldo Sculati had a warm relationship with Fangio, despite their shared success with the very difficult-to-drive Ferrari-developed Lancia car. Fangio started the year strongly by winning the gruelling 12-hour sportscar race at Sebring in America with Ferrari, driving with Eugenio Castellotti. But during the Grand Prix season, Fangio took over his teammate's cars after he suffered mechanical problems in three races, the Argentine, Monaco and Italian Grands Prix. In each case the points were shared between the two drivers. After the Monaco Grand Prix, where Fangio struggled with the ill-handling Lancia-Ferrari he asked Ferrari if he could have one mechanic exclusively for his car, as Ferrari did not have his mechanics assigned to any of the cars, as Mercedes had. Ferrari granted Fangio's request, and the performance of Fangio's car improved substantially. In addition to winning in Argentina, Fangio won the British and German Grands Prix at Silverstone and the N\u00fcrburgring. At the season-ending Italian Grand Prix, Fangio's Ferrari teammate Peter Collins, who was in a position to win the World Championship with just 15 laps to go, handed over his car to Fangio. They shared the six points won for second place, giving Fangio the World title.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I have never driven that quickly before in my life and I don't think I will ever be able to do it again.\"\n\u2014Fangio after the 1957 German Grand Prix\nIn 1957 Fangio returned to Maserati, who were still using the same iconic 250F which Fangio had driven at the start of 1954. Fangio started the season with a hat-trick of wins in Argentina, Monaco and France, before retiring with engine problems in Britain. He also won the Sebring sportscar race in driving a Maserati 450S with Jean Behra for the second year running. But at the Grand Prix after Britain, the German Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring circuit, Fangio needed to extend his lead by six points to claim the title with two races to spare. From pole position Fangio dropped to third behind the Ferraris of Mike Hawthorn and Collins but managed to get past both by the end of the third lap. Fangio had started with half-full tanks since he expected that he would need new tyres halfway through the race. In the event Fangio pitted on lap 13 with a 30-second lead, but a disastrous stop left him back in third place and 50 seconds behind Collins and Hawthorn. Fangio came into his own, setting one fastest lap after another, culminating in a record-breaking time on lap 20 a full eleven seconds faster than the best the Ferraris could do. On the penultimate lap Fangio got back past both Collins and Hawthorn, and held on to take the win by just over three seconds. With Musso finishing in fourth place, Fangio claimed his fifth title. This performance is often regarded as one of the greatest drives in Formula One history, and it was also Fangio's final victory in the sport. Fangio's record of five championships remained unbroken until 2003, when Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship.\nAfter his series of consecutive championships he retired in 1958, following the French Grand Prix. Such was the respect for Fangio that during that final race, race leader Hawthorn, who had lapped Fangio, braked as he was about to cross the line so that Fangio could complete the 50-lap distance in his final race; he crossed the line over two minutes down on Hawthorn. Getting out of the Maserati after the race, he said to his mechanic simply, \"It is finished.\" He was famous for winning races at what he described as the slowest possible speed, in order to conserve the car to the finish. Cars in the 1940s and 1950s were unpredictable in their reliability, with almost any component susceptible to breaking. He won 24 World Championship Grands Prix, 22 outright and two shared with other drivers, from 52 entries \u2013 a winning percentage of 46.15%, the highest in the sport's history (Alberto Ascari, who has the second-highest, holds a winning percentage of 40.63%). Both drivers were already experienced Grand Prix drivers before the world championship started.\nKidnapping.\nPresident Fulgencio Batista of Cuba established the non-Formula One Cuban Grand Prix in Havana in 1957. Fangio won the 1957 event, and had set fastest times during practice for the 1958 race. On 23 February 1958, two gunmen of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement entered the Hotel Lincoln in Havana and kidnapped Fangio. Batista ordered the race to continue as usual while a crack team of police hunted down the kidnappers. They set up roadblocks at intersections, and guards were assigned to private and commercial airports and to all competing drivers.\nFangio was taken to three separate houses. His captors allowed him to listen to the race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his own bedroom but became convinced that a guard was standing outside the bedroom door at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme, which Fangio had not wished to speak about, as he did not have an interest in politics. He later said: \"Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it.\" He was released after 29 hours, after being \"treated very well\".\nThe captors' motives were to force the cancellation of the race in an attempt to embarrass the Batista regime. When Fangio was handed over to the Argentine embassy soon after the race, many Cubans became convinced that Batista was losing his grip on power because he failed to track the captors down. The Cuban Revolution took over the government in January 1959, and the 1959 Cuban Grand Prix was cancelled. The Fangio kidnapping was dramatized in a 1999 Argentine film directed by Alberto Lecchi, \"Operaci\u00f3n Fangio\".\nLater life and death.\nPost-retirement activities.\nIn the early 1950s, Fangio was involved in a road accident when he was forced to swerve to avoid an oncoming truck. The car, a Lancia Aurelia GT, clipped a pole, spinning twice and threw Fangio out, which led him to sustain grazed elbows. One passenger stated the incident was the first time Fangio had been so terrified.\nWhen Fangio attended the 1958 Indianapolis 500, he was offered $20,000 to qualify in a Kurtis-Offenhauser by the car's owner, George Walther, Jr (father of future Indy 500 driver Salt Walther). Fangio had previously attended the 500 in 1948 at which time he expressed his interest in competing the race. However, he was unable to qualify with a car that did not work properly. Walther allowed Fangio to stand aside (before a contract with BP came to light), still he did not want another driver to take over Fangio's position.\nAfter his retirement, Fangio was distinguished as honorary President of the Automobile Sports Commission of the Argentine Republic. He also participated in many world exhibition races, tributes to motorsport figures and in the organization of events related to his profession. In 1960 he carried out an exhibition at the Sarmiento Park in C\u00f3rdoba city, with a Maserati 2500 of Ettore Chimeri, with which he suffered a run off the track, brushed a curb and accidentally lifted into the air without consequences. He became honorary president of the Club International des Anciens Pilotes de Grand Prix F1 in 1962.\nIn 1968, he collaborated with Autom\u00f3vil Club Argentino in the organization of the Formula 2 International Championship held in Argentina, a task that would become constant during the following years. Shortly thereafter, he headed the \"84 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring\" project for Argentine-made IKA-Renault Torino cars and traveled to Germany as a driver advisor with the Argentine team.\nFangio took part in the so-called \"Carrera del Recuerdo\", held on 17 October 1973 at the Aut\u00f3dromo de Buenos Aires with a Fiat Berlina 125. Legendary motorsport figures such as Oscar Alfredo G\u00e1lvez also took part in the race.\nFangio served as the flagman for the Argentine Grand Prix from 1972 to 1981, and for NASCAR's Winston 500 in 1975.\nHe was appointed president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina in April 1974 and the following year, he was part of an exhibition test in Dijon on the occasion of the Swiss Grand Prix aboard a Maserati 250F. On the 50th anniversary of the N\u00fcrburgring circuit, Fangio took part in the Fifth International Race of Historic Racing and Sports Cars, called \"Parade of Remembrance\", with the Mercedes-Benz W196 R. In 1979 he raced at the English circuit of Donington Park on the occasion of an event organized by the Gunnar Nilsson Foundation.\nFangio was the special guest of the 50th anniversary 1978 Australian Grand Prix at the Sandown Raceway in Melbourne (seven years before the Australian Grand Prix became a round of the World Championship in ). After awarding the Lex Davison Trophy to race winner Graham McRae (who stated that meeting Fangio was a bigger thrill than actually winning the race for the third time), Fangio drove his 1954 and 1955 World Championship-winning Mercedes-Benz W196 in a spirited three lap exhibition against three other cars, including the World Championship winning Brabham BT19 driven by Australia's own triple World Champion Jack Brabham. Despite his car being over ten years older than the Repco Brabham, Fangio pushed the Australian all the way to the flag. Before the event, Fangio (who at 67 years of age and not having raced competitively in 20 years, still held a full FIA Super Licence) had stated his intention of racing and not just putting in a demonstration drive.\nAfter racing in the Brussels Rally in 1981, he participated aboard a Chevrolet TC in the Gran Premio del Recuerdo, a caravan held in 1983 through the center of the Buenos Aires city to raise funds for the Patronato de la Infancia and the Asociaci\u00f3n de Ayuda al Menor of the Buenos Aires province.\nIn 1980, Konex Foundation granted him the Diamond Konex Award as the best Sportsman of the decade in Argentina. In 1981 Fangio travelled to Monza for the Italian Grand Prix, where he was reunited with his Tipo 159 Alfa Romeo from 1951 and the 1954 Lancia D50 for a couple of demonstrative laps. For the event Fangio was joined by old friends and fellow racers, including Toulo de Graffenried, Luigi Villoresi and Giorgio Scarlatti as well as former Alfa Romeo managers from the 1950s Paolo Marzotto and Battista Guidotti.\nFangio met the young Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna at the opening of the Grand Prix Strecke, the short circuit inside the N\u00fcrburgring Norschleiffe, in 1984. After that initial meeting, the five-time champion told the young driver, \"Now I understand why people speak so highly of you\". The good chemistry between the two drivers was immediate, and over time the friendship was firmly forged. Senna often traveled to Argentina to meet with Fangio, where, among other things, the young Brazilian would ask the champion for advice on how to run better on the circuits, and the experienced former driver would happily give it to him. One of Senna's trips to Argentina to see Fangio saved the Brazilian driver from a dangerous situation: in those days, Comando Vermelho, one of the most powerful and dangerous narco-criminal groups in Brazil, had planned to kidnap Senna.\nIn the 1990 Australian Grand Prix, which was held on the Adelaide streets, Formula 1 celebrated its 500th race and to celebrate it, they staged a photo-op that would go down in history. They brought together several champions: Nelson Piquet (active driver), Jack Brabham, James Hunt, Jackie Stewart, Denny Hulme, Senna and the \"Chueco\". Ayrton raised Fangio's arm, as if he were the judge of a boxing match, giving his blessing to the winner. After the event, the Argentinean former driver invited the then McLaren driver to Argentina to celebrate that season's title.\nFangio was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990. He returned to the spotlight in 1994, when he publicly opposed a new Province of Buenos Aires law denying driving licences to those over 80 (which included Fangio). Denied a renewal of his card, Fangio reportedly challenged Traffic Bureau personnel to a race between Buenos Aires and seaside Mar del Plata (a 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) distance) in two hours or less, following which an exception was made for the five-time champion.\nAyrton Senna would later invite Fangio again to the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix race held at the Interlagos circuit in S\u00e3o Paulo, where the Brazilian driver emerged victorious. Senna celebrated his victory with Fangio, the last time they were seen together in public. Both drivers would later have private meetings where Senna would often travel to Argentina or Fangio would travel to Senna's house in Brazil. When Senna died in an accident at the San Marino Grand Prix in May 1994, Fangio deeply mourned the driver's death. \"I have lost my heir and successor\" said Fangio at the time, showing his regret for the death of the young Brazilian driver. The former driver participated in Senna's funeral, and the subsequent burial, which was held with honors worthy of a state funeral due to the driver's great popularity, at the Morumbi Cemetery.\nHe was appointed honorary president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina in 1987, the only distinction granted in its history by the German company, and held the position until 1994. Fangio was appointed president of the Renault Foundation in 1990 and continued to make public appearances especially in international exhibition races until his health began to deteriorate. He held his last competition on the Sardinia Island in 1993 aboard an Alfetta 159 in the company of other figures of his time.\nHis role at Mercedes-Benz during the Argentine military dictatorship.\nOn the centenary of his birth in 2011, two projects were presented in the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires by the PRO to honor him, which were resisted by both the Buenos Aires Deputy Ombudsman's Office and by the representative Delia Bisutti, who pointed out that \"a claim is being made for Fangio in its entirety and someone of his renown could not be oblivious to what was happening. \"Here there was a military dictatorship with civic accompaniment, and it is very important to highlight what happened to Fangio.\" Fernando de Andreis, the deputy who presented the project, dismissed the accusation, stating that it was unfounded. Graciela Borges, widow of Juan Manuel Bordeu, also defended Fangio, arguing that the visit to Venezuela made by the broker in the 70s would have been made with any other government.\nJuan Manuel Fangio Motorsport Museum.\nIn 1979, some residents of the city of Balcarce began to promote the formation of a work commission to the construction of a Museum when they learned of Fangio's intention to gather all his trophies, cars and presents accumulated throughout his life sports in one place. On 26 October of that year, the \"Juan Manuel Fangio Motorsport Pro-Museum Commission\" was established under municipal support.\nAn old building from 1906, in which the Municipality and the Deliberative Council of Balcarce had functioned, was chosen to establish the museum. Although the building had been closed for years, and was in a deplorable state of conservation, it occupied a lot of significant proportions and was located in the southern corner of the town's main square. The community history of the building generated a desire to recover it as the city's architectural heritage.\nAware at the end of 1980 of the proposal of the Pro-museum Commission, Province of Buenos Aires \"De facto\" Governor, Ib\u00e9rico Saint Jean, promoted it and provided the initial capital that made the bidding and the beginnings possible. of the work.\nThe economic contributions, which given the inflationary process was close to 18% of the cost (at the beginning it represented 75%-80%), was expanded with donations from national and international companies, people adhering to the project, contributions from Fangio himself and was completed with different activities organized by the commission.\nThe former racer donated all his trophies and a wide variety of automobiles to the municipality of Balcarce in 1983 for later presentation at the Museum. Finally, on 22 November 1986, the Juan Manuel Fangio Technological-Cultural Center and Automobile Museum was inaugurated.\nThe restoration of the building and its contents caused astonishment among visitors and world journalists, leading it to be described as the most important motorsports museum in South America and the best dedicated to a competitive driver.\nUpon concluding its objective, the Pro-Museum Commission was dissolved. However, at the request of Fangio and Juan Manuel Bordeu, the Juan Manuel Fangio Automobile Museum Foundation was created, an entity that manages and governs the destiny of the museum and is responsible for preserving, maintaining and increasing Fangio's sports heritage.\nDecreased health and death.\nThe former racer's health deteriorated in the last decades of his life. In December 1970, he suffered a serious heart attack and in 1981, after exhibiting a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR in Dubai, he had another heart attack. The following year he was subjected to a surgical intervention in which the renowned Cardiologist Doctor Ren\u00e9 Favaloro implanted five \"bypass\".\nIn the late 1980s he was diagnosed with chronic kidney failure and in 1992, he underwent surgery to remove a benign tumor from his kidneys. He suffered an intestinal infection in 1993 in Stuttgart, for which he had to be hospitalized. At the end of that year he had to be admitted again for fifteen days to the Mater Dei Clinic due to blood hypercalcemia. In his last years he had to undergo three weekly sessions of dialysis by Doctor Roque Sala at the same time that he began with a progressive loss of consciousness and motor problems derived from his previous pathologies. After an emergency hospitalization in January 1995, he confined himself to his home in Palermo Viejo, where he continued with treatment and abandoned practically all his public appearances.\nOn 14 July 1995, he suffered from respiratory failure with excess phlegm that led to his admission to the Mater Dei Clinic, where he was diagnosed with bronchopneumonia. One day later he had a respiratory crisis and his diagnosis worsened on 16 July when he suffered a decompensation in his state of health that until then had remained stable. Fangio died on 17 July 1995 at 84 years old at 4:10 AM UTC-3 in Buenos Aires.\nAfter learning of the death of the former racer, President of the Nation Argentina Carlos Sa\u00fal Menem arranged the White Room of the Casa Rosada for his funeral. His pallbearers were his younger brother Ruben Renato (\"Toto\"), fellow racing icons Stirling Moss and Jackie Stewart, compatriot champions Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez and Carlos Reutemann, and the president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina at the time.\nThe president of FIFA, Jo\u00e3o Havelange, expressed his condolences and Jackie Stewart, three-time Formula 1 world champion and personal friend of Fangio, decided to travel for the funeral. The president of the FIA, Max Mosley, immediately traveled to Argentina upon learning of Fangio's death.\nAfter the first funeral at the Casa Rosada, the remains of the former racer were transferred for a new funeral at the headquarters of the Autom\u00f3vil Club Argentino and then a last funeral was held at the Fangio Museum before finally being placed in the family pantheon of the Balcarce Cemetery.\nIn 2021, the remains of the racer were moved from the Balcarce Cemetery to the Museum that bears his name, in the same city where he was born and grew up more than 110 years ago, being the culmination of a ceremony that lasted two days full of tributes to Fangio, coinciding also with the 70th anniversary of his first Formula 1 victory. The ceremony was attended by Oscar \u201cCacho\u201d, Ruben and Juan Carlos, the three sons of the quintuple, together with outstanding national and world motorsport personalities such as Sir Jackie Stewart, Oreste Berta and Horacio Pagani, who were also Fangio's friends. After the Roman Catholic religious service, officiated by the Mar del Plata's Bishop, the coffin with the remains of the former racer was placed in a special vault in the Museum, next to the trophies he won and some of the cars with which he had his successful racing career.\nPersonal life.\nFangio never married, but was romantically involved for more than twenty years with Andrea \u201cBeba\u201d Berruet, with whom he had a son on April 6, 1938: Oscar \u201cCacho\u201d Espinoza. He was registered with the surname of Berruet's husband, Luis Alcides Espinoza, because they were not legally separated, since at that time civil divorce did not yet exist in Argentina.\nThe relationship between Berruet and Fangio did not last beyond the racer's sporting retirement in the early 1960s, but shortly before, in 1955, Fangio began legal proceedings for the adoption of his own eldest son, something he abandoned shortly thereafter.\nOscar Espinoza's first opportunity to try to get his real last name was in 1966. \"Cacho\", who against his father's wishes (Fangio wanted his son to study medicine at University) became a racing driver, had the opportunity to go racing in the European Formula Two Championship. Because he had to renew his passport to travel to Europe, and the renewal process was delayed, Juan Manuel told his son that the only chance to get his passport renewed as quickly as possible was to add the surname Fangio to his Identity Card, and that was how it was given. Thus began his professional career in motorsport as \"Cacho\" Fangio, although it was known that this was only a patch and not a concrete reality.\n\"Cacho\" even participated in the Argentine Mission, organized by his father, of the 84 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring in August 1969, where national cars IKA Torino, prepared by the renowned mechanic Oreste Berta, competed.\nIn the 1970s, the relationship between Fangio and his eldest son deteriorated almost completely because \"Cacho\" began to demand that his father give him his real last name. Espinoza filed a filiation lawsuit against Juan Manuel Fangio, repudiating Luis Alcides Espinoza's paternity. The lawsuit was rejected in First and Second Instance by the National Civil Court of the Capital Federal. Fangio and his son stopped talking to each other for many years. Even, in the homage that the President of the Nation Argentina Carlos Sa\u00fal Menem paid to the former racer in 1994 for the 25th anniversary of the 84 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring 1969, they met again and only shook hands. The following year, with Fangio's health deteriorating, they met again at the racer's home in Buenos Aires, where father and son were able to reconcile and have a quiet chat, being the last time Fangio was able to see his eldest son, shortly time before his death.\nIn 2000, Espinoza publicly admitted in an interview to \"Ol\u00e9\" that he was the former racer's unrecognized son and in 2008 he initiated a case in a Buenos Aires civil court to prove his filiation and to be able to use his paternal surname.\nAfter Fangio's death, it was \u201cCacho's\u201d youngest daughter, Carolina, who urged her father to continue with the parentage claim even though the former racer was no longer physically present. Espinoza stopped the filiation claim because his daughter, who had urged him to continue with the claim, died of Cancer in 2011. \"Cacho\" was plunged into sadness by the death of his daughter and only two years later was he able to resume the search for his true identity.\nIn 2005, Rub\u00e9n Juan V\u00e1zquez, a former railway and hotelier employee born in Balcarce and currently residing in the town of Ca\u00f1uelas, filed a paternity suit similar to the one already filed by \u201cCacho\u201d Espinoza to find out if he is indeed also Fangio's son. Born 4 years after Espinoza (on June 25, 1942, the day after Fangio's 31st birthday), V\u00e1zquez claimed to be the fruit of an extramarital relationship between his mother, Catalina Basili, and Fangio, whom he met when Rub\u00e9n's maternal half-brother, Ricardo V\u00e1zquez, suffered an accident while working in the mechanical workshop that the racer owned in Balcarce. The extramarital relationship between Basili and Fangio that later resulted in the pregnancy was a secret that not even Pedro Antonio V\u00e1zquez, Basili's husband, knew about during his lifetime. Fangio was V\u00e1zquez's baptismal godfather, and even at one point, at that time without knowing or suspecting that he was his biological father, he turned to the former racer to ask for a recommendation to go to work at Mercedes Benz, due to the difference salaries since they paid better salaries in the automotive industry than in the Railway, where V\u00e1zquez worked at that time.\nRub\u00e9n's first suspicion about his true identity arose in 1995 when he worked in a Hotel in Pinamar. A doctor, a client of the Hotel, who noticed V\u00e1zquez's physical resemblance to Fangio told him that when he took a DNA test he was going to get a surprise.\nAfter ten years and after receiving more comments that he was similar to Fangio not only physically but also in his voice, in 2005 V\u00e1zquez decided to confront his mother to find out the truth about whether or not he was the son of the former racer, although she was still weighed down by the extramarital relationship she had had with the \u201cChueco\u201d decades ago. After several refusals, Basili finally confessed the truth to his son. V\u00e1zquez turned to the Law firm of the renowned Lawyer Miguel \u00c1ngel Pierri and his partner, Lisandro Faisal, who initiated the filiation case that would determine if V\u00e1zquez was indeed Fangio's son.\nCatalina Basili died in December 2012, at 103 years old, but shortly before her death she had signed a deed before a Notary Public admitting that her son was the fruit of a relationship with Fangio.\nIn order to initially follow up on the filiation lawsuit filed by Espinoza, on July 16, 2015, the Civil and Commercial Judge of Mar del Plata, Rodrigo Cataldo, ordered the exhumation of Fangio's body from the Municipal Cemetery of Balcarce, which took place on August 7 of the same year. After the exhumation and in order to extract samples from the racer's remains, experts sent by the Civil and Commercial Judge of La Plata, Daniel Dipp, who was in charge of Rub\u00e9n V\u00e1zquez's filiation case, were also present. The samples were sent to laboratories in La Plata, where they were compared with the blood samples of Espinoza and V\u00e1zquez In December 2015, the Court confirmed that Espinosa was indeed Fangio's son, and in February 2016, it was confirmed that Rub\u00e9n V\u00e1zquez was also Fangio's son.\nIn June 2016, Juan Carlos Rodr\u00edguez, a retired Agricultural Engineer, born in 1945 in Balcarce and currently residing in the same City, underwent an initial DNA study with Oscar Fangio, who had known each other for more than three decades, although at that time both did not know they were brothers, because although Rodr\u00edguez knew that his father was Juan Manuel, \u201cCacho\u201d believed that Rodr\u00edguez was the son of Rub\u00e9n Renato Aniceto Fangio, \u201cToto\u201d, the younger brother of the racer and father of the also racing driver Juan Manuel Fangio II.\nJuan Carlos was the fruit of a brief relationship between Silvia Rodriguez, who was fifteen years old at the time, and the racer, who was already thirty-three years old. The genetic result between Rodriguez and Cacho Fangio was that they are brothers with a certainty of almost 98%, which would lead to the conclusion that Rodriguez would also be the son of Juan Manuel, although the next step was still missing, which was to perform the same study by matching the DNA samples of Rodriguez with those extracted from the remains of the \u201cChueco\u201d.\u201c\nIn May 2021 DNA studies confirmed that Juan Carlos Rodriguez is also Fangio's son.\nIn June 2018, Oscar and Rub\u00e9n Fangio became the heirs of the multimillion-dollar fortune that their father amassed during his years in motorsport, thus displacing their cousins, the former racer's nephews, who had been left with most of the material assets after Fangio's death. Some time later, the youngest of the three Fangio brothers, Juan Carlos, joined as the third heir to the fortune.\nHis nephew, Juan Manuel Fangio II, is also a racing driver.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"You must always strive to be the best, but you must never believe that you are.\"\n\u2014Juan Manuel Fangio\nFangio's record of five World Championship titles stood for 46 years until German driver Michael Schumacher surpassed it in 2003. Schumacher said, \"Fangio is on a level much higher than I see myself. What he did stands alone and what we have achieved is also unique. I have such respect for what he achieved. You can't take a personality like Fangio and compare him with what has happened today. There is not even the slightest comparison.\" When Lewis Hamilton equaled Fangio's five titles in 2018 he praised Fangio calling him the \"Godfather of our sport\".\nIn October 2020, \"The Economist\" ranked champion drivers by the relative importance of car quality to driver skill. According to this ranking, Fangio is Formula 1's best driver of all time.\nIn November 2020, Carteret Analytics used quantitative analysis methods to rank Formula One drivers.\u00a0According to this ranking, Fangio is Formula 1's best driver of all time. Similar mathematical analysis has also placed Fangio as the greatest of all time, once the era of racing was considered.\nIn his home country of Argentina, Fangio is revered as one of the greatest sportsmen the nation has ever produced. He is nicknamed \"El Maestro\" (the master).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"What he did in his time is something that was an example of professionalism, of courage, of style and as a man, a human being. Every year there is a winner of the championship, but not necessarily a world champion. I think Fangio is the example of a true world champion\"\n\u2014Ayrton Senna\nSix statues of Fangio, sculpted by Catalan artist Joaquim Ros Sabat\u00e9, stand at race venues around the world: Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires; Monte Carlo, Monaco; Montmel\u00f3, Spain; N\u00fcrburgring, Germany; Stuttgart-Untert\u00fcrkheim, Germany; and Monza, Italy.\nThe \"Museo Juan Manuel Fangio\" was established in Balcarce (Fangio's birthplace) in 1986.\nArgentina's largest oil company, Repsol YPF, launched the \"Fangio XXI\" gas brand. The Zonda 2005 C12 F, also known as the Zonda Fangio, was designed in honour of Fangio and was released 10 years after his death. Maserati created a special website in 2007 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his fifth and final world championship triumph. A Mercedes-Benz W196R Formula 1 race car, driven by Fangio in his World Championship-qualifying Grand Prix races in 1954 and 1955 was sold for a record $30 million at an auction in England on 12 July 2013.\nRacing record.\nComplete Formula One World Championship results.\n\u2020 Car ran with streamlined, full-width bodywork.\nFormula One records.\nFangio holds the following Formula One records:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

{"id": "48535", "revid": "24936139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48535", "title": "Pennsylvania Avenue", "text": "Street in Maryland and Washington, D.C., US\n \nPennsylvania Avenue is a primarily diagonal street in Washington, D.C., that connects the United States Capitol with the White House and then crosses northwest Washington, D.C., to Georgetown. Traveling through southeast Washington from the Capitol, it enters Prince George's County, Maryland, and becomes MD Route 4 (MD 4) and then MD Route 717 in Upper Marlboro, and finally Stephanie Roper Highway.\nThe section of the avenue between the White House, which is sometimes referred to by its address \"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\", and the Capitol forms the basis for the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site and is sometimes referred to as \"America's Main Street\"; it is the location of official parades and processions, and periodic protest marches. Pennsylvania Avenue is an important commuter road and is part of the National Highway System.\nRoute.\nThe avenue runs for in Washington, D.C., but the of Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to the United States Capitol building is far and away the most famed section of the avenue. It continues within the city for , from the southeast corner of the Capitol grounds through the Capitol Hill neighborhood, and over the Anacostia River on the John Philip Sousa Bridge. Crossing most of Prince George's County, Maryland, it ends from the Washington, D.C., border in Maryland at the junction with MD 717 in Upper Marlboro, where the name changes to Stephanie Roper Highway, for a total length of . Stephanie Roper Highway used to be Pennsylvania Avenue, but was renamed in 2012. In addition to its street names, in Maryland it is designated as Maryland Route 4.\nNorthwest of the White House, Pennsylvania Avenue runs for to its end at M Street N.W. in Georgetown, just beyond the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge over Rock Creek. From 1862 to 1962, streetcars ran the length of the avenue from Georgetown to the Anacostia River.\nHistory.\n18th century.\nAlthough Pennsylvania Avenue extends six miles (10\u00a0km) in Washington, D.C., the expanse between the White House and the United States Capitol constitutes the ceremonial heart of the nation. It was designed by Pierre Charles L'Enfant, and was one of the earliest streets constructed in the city. The width of the avenue was set at 160 feet, identical to the narrowest points of the Champs Elysees in Paris that L'Enfant is likely to have examined. The first documented reference to the street as Pennsylvania Avenue was in a 1791 letter from Thomas Jefferson. One theory behind the avenue's name is that it was named for Pennsylvania as consolation for moving the capital from Philadelphia in 1800 and in recognition of Pennsylvania's historical significance in the nation's founding. Both Jefferson and Washington considered Pennsylvania Avenue an important feature of the new capital. The stretch outside the White House was established in 1804 when President Jefferson ordered the road to be cut through President's Park. For decades, Pennsylvania Avenue was a wide dirt road ridiculed by Jefferson as \"The Great Serbonian Bog\", he planted it with rows of fast-growing \"Populus nigra\".\n19th century.\nIn 1832, in an effort to tame dust and dirt on Pennsylvania Avenue, it was paved using the macadam method. But over the years, other pavement methods were trialed on the avenue: cobblestones in 1849 followed by Belgian blocks and then, in 1871, wooden blocks.\nPennsylvania Avenue once provided an unobstructed view between the White House and the Capitol. The construction of an expansion to the Treasury Building blocked this view, and supposedly President Andrew Jackson did this on purpose. Relations between the president and Congress were strained, and Jackson did not want to see the Capitol out his window, though in reality the Treasury Building was simply built on what was cheap government land.\nIn 1876, as part of an initiative begun by President Ulysses S. Grant to see the city's streets improved, Pennsylvania Avenue was paved with asphalt by Civil War veteran William W. Averell using Trinidad and Guanoco lakes asphalt.\n20th century.\nIn 1959, Pennsylvania Avenue was extended from the Washington, D.C., border with Maryland to Dower House Road in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.\nOn September 30, 1965, portions of the avenue and surrounding area were designated the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site. The National Park Service administers this area which includes the United States Navy Memorial, Old Post Office Tower, and Pershing Park. After the Great Depression in the 1930s and the move of affluent families to suburbs in the 1950s, Pennsylvania Avenue became increasingly blighted. John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson tried to redevelop the street as part of the New Frontier and Great Society reforms, but the avenue further declined after the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots in the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.\nIn 1972, Congress created the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) to rehabilitate the street between the Capitol and the White House, an area seen as blighted. The new organization was given the mandate of developing Pennsylvania Avenue \"in a manner suitable to its ceremonial, physical, and historic relationship to the legislative and executive branches of the federal government\".\nIn the 1980s, renovations were made to the Willard Hotel, the Old Post Office, and Washington Union Station, each located on or adjacent to Pennsylvania Avenue.\n21st century.\nIn 2010, the District of Columbia designated Pennsylvania Avenue from the southwestern terminus of John Philip Sousa Bridge to the Maryland state line to be a \"D.C. Great Street\". The city spent $430 million to beautify the street and improve the roadway.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses along Pennsylvania Avenue faced significant challenges and closures. With reduced tourism, remote work trends keeping office buildings quieter, and a historical lack of the avenue itself being a primary destination, many establishments struggled to sustain operations. The combination of decreased foot traffic and shifting consumer behavior further strained local businesses, leading to closures as they struggled to adapt to the new economic realities.\nIn 2022, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) launched the Pennsylvania Avenue Initiative to revitalize the iconic thoroughfare by transforming it into a dynamic public space and transportation corridor. Accelerated by the changes brought about by remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, the initiative aims to re-imagine Pennsylvania Avenue from its current eight-lane design predominantly catering to cars to a more inclusive and equitable space. This vision includes accommodating a variety of activities and users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, buses, emergency vehicles, and delivery trucks, alongside hosting events and fostering community engagement.\nTo achieve this transformation, the initiative involves collaborative efforts between NCPC and consulting teams like HR&amp;A Advisors. They are tasked with updating traffic studies to explore reallocating roadway space for new sidewalks, bike lanes, transit-only lanes, mid-block crossings, and other streetscape elements. Additionally, the initiative prioritizes refining early design concepts into preferred alternatives based on economic feasibility, stakeholder input, and environmental considerations. Ultimately, the goal is to elevate Pennsylvania Avenue's status as a premier public space in Washington, DC, comparable to other renowned urban boulevards around the world.\nIn 2024, NCPC is expected to announce a second consultant team to help develop the New Pennsylvania Avenue Plan that will address design and infrastructure improvements along the corridor and adjoining public spaces.\nParades and protests.\nPresidential inaugurations.\nEver since an impromptu procession formed around Jefferson's second inauguration, every U.S. president except Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump during their respective second inaugurations, (1985 and 2025) have paraded down Pennsylvania Avenue after taking the oath of office. Reagan and Trump both paraded up the avenue for their respective first inaugurations (January 1981 and January 2017) but not following their respective second inaugurations (1985 because freezing temperatures and high winds made it dangerous and 2025 because of polar vortex, extreme cold, and high winds).\nPresidential funeral processions.\nFrom William Henry Harrison to Jimmy Carter, the funeral corteges of seven of the eight presidents who died in office and three former presidents followed this route. Franklin Roosevelt was the only president who died in office whose cortege did not follow this route.\nAbraham Lincoln's funeral cortege solemnly proceeded along Pennsylvania Avenue in 1865; only weeks later, the end of the American Civil War was celebrated with the Grand Review of the Armies when the Army of the Potomac paraded more joyously along the avenue. The funeral processions of Lyndon B. Johnson, Ford, and Carter proceeded down Pennsylvania Avenue. For Lyndon Johnson, the cortege was along Pennsylvania Avenue from U.S. Capitol to National City Christian Church, where he often worshiped and where his funeral was held. Ford's funeral went up Pennsylvania Avenue, pausing at the White House en route to Washington National Cathedral, where his funeral was held. Carter's funeral procession went down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, with a casket transfer stop the United States Navy Memorial.\nProtests and celebrations.\nIn addition to serving as a location for official functions, Pennsylvania Avenue is a traditional parade and protest route of ordinary citizens. During the depression of the 1890s, Jacob Coxey marched 500 supporters down Pennsylvania Avenue to the U.S. Capitol to demand federal aid for the unemployed. Similarly, on the eve of Woodrow Wilson's 1913 inauguration, Alice Paul masterminded a parade, the Woman Suffrage Procession, highlighting the women's suffrage movement. In July 1932, a contingent of the Bonus Expeditionary Force carried flags up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, where they formed picket lines.\nPennsylvania Avenue also has served as a background for more lighthearted celebrations, including a series of Shriner's parades in the 1920s and 1930s. Thomas and Concepcion Picciotto are the founders of the White House Peace Vigil, the longest-running anti-nuclear peace vigil in the nation at Lafayette Square on the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue.\nSecurity measures.\nAfter the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995, the Secret Service closed the portion of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House permanently to all vehicular traffic. Pedestrian and bicycle traffic, however, was still permitted on the sidewalk. After the September 11 attacks, all traffic in front of the White House was prohibited. Pedestrian traffic resumed in 2004. Vehicular traffic near the White House is now redirected to H Street or Constitution Avenue, both of which eventually link back with Pennsylvania Avenue.\nIn 2002, the National Capital Planning Commission invited several prominent landscape architects to submit proposals for the redesign of Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House, with the intention that the security measures would be woven into an overall plan for the precinct and a more welcoming public space might be created. The winning entry by a firm run by Michael Van Valkenburgh proposed a very simple approach to planting, paving, and the integration of required security steps. Construction was completed in 2004.\nSites of interest.\nFrom east to west:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe National Theatre and Warner Theatre use Pennsylvania Avenue mailing addresses, although the theaters are nearby on E Street and 13th Street respectively.\nTransit service.\nMetrobus.\nThe following Metrobus routes travel along the street (listed from west to east):\nDC Circulator.\nThe DC Circulator travels along the street:\nMTA Maryland Commuter Bus.\nThe following MTA Maryland Commuter Bus routes travel along the street:\nBus.\nThe following routes of TheBus serve Pennsylvania Ave. in Prince George's County:\nWashington Metro.\nThe following Washington Metro stations have entrances located near Pennsylvania Avenue:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They followed up with an ultra-slow cover of \"Rock Around the Clock\", a relaxed and dispassionate version of Plastic Bertrand's punk song \"\u00c7a Plane Pour Moi\", and a mechanical cover of \"Dance to the Music\", originally by Sly Stone. Telex built its music entirely from electronic instruments, employing joyously irreverent humor. The group's debut album, \"Looking for Saint Tropez\", featured the worldwide hit single \"Moskow Diskow\".\nIn 1980, Telex's manager asked the group to enter the Eurovision Song Contest.

After studying theology, he became Agent-General of the Clergy in 1780. In 1789, just before the French Revolution, he became Bishop of Autun. He worked at the highest levels of successive French governments, most commonly as foreign minister or in some other diplomatic capacity. He served as the French Diplomat in the Congress of Vienna. His career spanned the regimes of Louis XVI, the years of the French Revolution, Napoleon, Louis XVIII, Charles X, and Louis Philippe I. Those Talleyrand served often distrusted him but found him extremely useful. The name \"Talleyrand\" has become a byword for crafty and cynical diplomacy.\nTalleyrand was Napoleon's chief diplomat during the years when French military victories brought one European state after another under French hegemony. Most of the time, he worked for peace so as to consolidate France's gains. He succeeded in obtaining peace with Austria through the 1801 Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville and with Britain in the 1802 Treaty of Amiens. He could not prevent the renewal of war in 1803 but by 1805 he opposed his emperor's renewed wars against Austria, Prussia, and Russia. He resigned as foreign minister in August 1807, but retained the trust of Napoleon. He conspired to undermine the emperor's plans through secret dealings with Tsar Alexander I of Russia and the Austrian minister Klemens von Metternich. Talleyrand sought a negotiated secure peace so as to perpetuate the gains of the French Revolution. Napoleon rejected peace; when he fell in 1814, Talleyrand supported the Bourbon Restoration decided by the Allies. He played a major role at the Congress of Vienna in 1814\u20131815, where he negotiated a favorable for France and played a role in unwinding the Napoleonic Wars.\nTalleyrand polarizes opinion. Some regard him as one of the most versatile, skilled, and influential diplomats in European history, while others believe that he was a traitor, betraying in turn the ancien r\u00e9gime, the French Revolution, and Napoleon.\nEarly life.\nTalleyrand was born in Paris into an aristocratic family which, though ancient and illustrious, was not particularly prosperous. His father, Count Charles Daniel de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord, was 20 years of age when Charles was born. His mother was Alexandrine de Damas d'Antigny. Both his parents held positions at court, but as the youngest children of their respective families, had no important income. Talleyrand's father had a long career in the French Royal Army, reaching the rank of lieutenant general, as did his uncle, Gabriel Marie de P\u00e9rigord, despite having the same infirmity from which Talleyrand would suffer throughout his life. His father served all through the Seven Years' War.\nFrom childhood, Talleyrand walked with a limp, which caused him to later be called \"\" (French for \"the lame devil\") among other nicknames. In his \"Memoirs\", he linked this infirmity to an accident at age four, but recent research has shown that his limp was, in fact, congenital. It might have been a congenital clubfoot. In any case, his handicap made him unable to inherit his father's title, despite being the eldest surviving son. The alternative, chosen for him by his parents, was a career in the Church.\nThe latter held out the hope for Charles-Maurice of succeeding his uncle, Alexandre Ang\u00e9lique de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord, then Archbishop of Reims, one of the most prestigious and richest dioceses in France. At eight years old, Talleyrand attended the Coll\u00e8ge d'Harcourt, the seminary of Saint-Sulpice, while studying theology at the Sorbonne until the age of 21. In his free time, he read the works of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and other writers who were beginning to question the authority of the ancien r\u00e9gime in matters of church and state. As subdeacon he witnessed the coronation of Louis XVI at Reims in 1775.\nHe was not ordained a Catholic priest until four years later, on 19 December 1779, at the age of 25. Very soon, in 1780, he attained the influential position of Agent-General of the Clergy, and was instrumental in promoting the drawing up of a general inventory of Church properties in France as of 1785, along with a defense of \"inalienable rights of the Church\", the latter being a stance he later denied. In 1788, the influence of Talleyrand's father and family overcame the King's dislike and obtained his appointment as Bishop of Autun, with a stipend of 22,000 livres. He was consecrated a bishop on 4 January 1789 by Louis-Andr\u00e9 de Grimaldi. The undoubtedly able Talleyrand, though hardly devout and even free-thinking in the Enlightenment mold, was outwardly respectful of religious observance. In the course of the Revolution, however, he was to manifest his cynicism and abandon all orthodox Catholic practice. He resigned his bishopric on 13 April 1791. On 29 June 1802, Pope Pius VII laicized Talleyrand, an event most uncommon at the time in the history of the Church.\nFrench Revolution.\nShortly after he was consecrated as Bishop of Autun, Talleyrand attended the Estates-General of 1789, representing the clergy, the First Estate. During the French Revolution, Talleyrand strongly supported the anti-clericalism of the revolutionaries. Along with Mirabeau, he promoted the appropriation of Church properties. He participated in the writing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and proposed both the Decree on the goods of the clergy placed at the disposal of the Nation in 1789 and the Civil Constitution of the Clergy that nationalized the Church in preference to allegiance to the Pope. He also swore in the first four constitutional bishops, even though he had himself resigned as Bishop following his excommunication by Pope Pius VI in 1791. During the \"F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\" on 14 July 1790, Talleyrand celebrated Mass. Notably, he promoted public education in full spirit of the Enlightenment by preparing a 216-page Report on Public Instruction. It proposed pyramidical structure rising through local, district, and departmental schools, and parts were later adopted. During his 5-month tenure in the Estates-General, Talleyrand was also involved in drawing up the police regulations of Paris, proposed the suffrage of Jews, supported a ban on the tithes, and invented a method to ensure loans. Few bishops followed him in obedience to the new decree, and much of the French clergy came to view him as schismatic.\nJust before his resignation from the bishopric, Talleyrand had been elected, with Mirabeau and the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s, a member of the department of Paris. In that capacity he did useful work for some eighteen months in seeking to support the cause of order in the turbulent capital. Though he was often on strained terms with Mirabeau, his views generally coincided with those of that statesman, who before he died is said to have advised Talleyrand to develop a close understanding with England.\nIn 1792, Talleyrand was sent twice, unofficially, to London to avert war, and he was cordially received by Pitt and Grenville. After his first visit, he persuaded the then foreign minister, Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez, of the importance of having a fully accredited ambassador in London, and the marquis de Chauvelin was duly appointed, with Talleyrand as his deputy. Still, after an initial British declaration of neutrality during the first campaigns of 1792, his mission ultimately failed. In September 1792, just at the beginning of the September massacres, he left Paris for England, having acquired a passport from Danton personally.\nThe National Convention issued a warrant for Talleyrand's arrest in December 1792. In March 1794, with the two countries at the brink of war, he was forced to leave Britain by Pitt's expulsion order. He then went to the neutral country of the United States. The ship he took to the US was forced by rough weather in the Channel to stop at Falmouth where Talleyrand recounts an awkward chance meeting with Benedict Arnold at an inn. During Talleyrand's stay in the US, he supported himself by working as a bank agent, involved in commodity trading and real estate speculation. He was a house guest of Aaron Burr of New York and collaborated with Theophile Cazenove in Philadelphia. On 19 May 1794, Matthew Clarkson, the mayor of Philadelphia, received his oath. Talleyrand swore \"that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to...the United States of America... \" Burr later sought similar refuge in Talleyrand's home during his self-imposed European exile (1808\u201312). However, Talleyrand would refuse to return the favor because Burr had killed Talleyrand's friend Alexander Hamilton in an 1804 duel.\nTalleyrand returned to France in 1796. After 9 Thermidor, he mobilized his friends (most notably the abb\u00e9 Martial Borye Desrenaudes and Germaine de Sta\u00ebl) to lobby in the National Convention and the newly established Directoire for his return. His name was suppressed from the \"\u00e9migr\u00e9\" list and he returned to France on 25 September 1796. After gaining attention by giving addresses on the value of commercial relations with England, and of colonization as a way of renewing the nation, he became Foreign Minister in July 1797. He was behind the demand for bribes in the XYZ Affair which escalated into the Quasi-War, an undeclared naval war with the United States, 1798\u20131800. Talleyrand saw a possible political career for Napoleon during the Italian campaigns of 1796 to 1797. He wrote many letters to Napoleon, and the two became close allies. Talleyrand was against the destruction of the Republic of Venice, but he complimented Napoleon when the Treaty of Campo Formio with Austria was concluded (Venice was given to Austria), probably because he wanted to reinforce his alliance with Napoleon. Later in 1797, Talleyrand was instrumental in assisting with the Coup of 18 Fructidor, which ousted two moderate members of the Directory in favor of the Jacobins headed by Paul Barras. He was also an early advocate of the Expedition to Egypt.\nUnder Napoleon.\nTalleyrand, along with Napoleon's younger brother, Lucien Bonaparte, was instrumental in the 1799 \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" of 18 Brumaire, establishing the French Consulate government, although he also made preparations for flight if necessary. He also persuaded Barras to resign as Director. Talleyrand was soon made Foreign Minister by Napoleon, although he rarely agreed with Napoleon's foreign policy. Domestically, Talleyrand used his influence to help in the repeal of the strict laws against \u00e9migr\u00e9s, refractory clergy, and the royalists of the west.\nThe Pope released him from the ban of excommunication in the Concordat of 1801, which also revoked the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Talleyrand was instrumental in the completion of the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. He wanted Napoleon to keep peace afterwards, as he thought France had reached its maximum expansion. Talleyrand was an integral player in the German mediatization. While the Treaty of Campo Formio of 1797 had, on paper, stripped German princes of their lands beyond the left bank of the Rhine, it was not enforced until the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville in 1801. As the French annexed these lands, leaders believed that rulers of states such as Baden, Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, Prussia, Hesse and Nassau, who lost territories on the Left Bank, should receive new territories on the Right Bank through the secularization of ecclesiastical principalities. Many of these rulers gave out bribes in order to secure new lands, and Talleyrand and some of his associates amassed about 10 million francs in the process. This was the first blow in the destruction of the Holy Roman Empire.\nWhile helping to establish French supremacy in neighboring states and assisting Bonaparte in securing the title of \"First Consul\" for life, Talleyrand sought all means of securing the permanent welfare of France. He worked hard to prevent the rupture of the peace of Amiens which occurred in May 1803, and he did what he could to prevent the Louisiana Purchase earlier in the year. These events, as he saw, told against the best interests of France and endangered the gains which she had secured by war and diplomacy. Thereafter he strove to moderate Napoleon's ambition and to preserve the European system as far as possible.\nNapoleon forced Talleyrand into marriage in September 1802 to longtime mistress Catherine Grand (n\u00e9e Worl\u00e9e). Talleyrand purchased the Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay in May 1803, upon the urging of Napoleon. This later was used as the site of imprisonment of the Spanish royal family in 1808\u20131813, after Napoleon's invasion of Spain. In May 1804, Napoleon bestowed upon Talleyrand the title of Grand Chamberlain of the Empire, with almost 500,000 francs a year. In 1806, he was made Sovereign Prince of Benevento (or B\u00e9n\u00e9vent), a former Papal fief in southern Italy. Talleyrand held the title until 1815 and administered the principality concurrently with his other tasks.\nTalleyrand was opposed to the harsh treatment of Austria in the 1805 Treaty of Pressburg and of Prussia in the Peace of Tilsit in 1807. In 1806, after Pressburg, he profited greatly from the reorganization of the German lands, this time into the Confederation of the Rhine. He negotiated the Treaty of Posen with Saxony, but was shut out completely from the negotiations at Tilsit. After Queen Louise of Prussia failed in her appeal to Napoleon to spare her nation, she wept and was consoled by Talleyrand. This gave him a good name among the elites of European nations outside France.\nChanging sides.\nHaving wearied of serving a master in whom he no longer had much confidence, Talleyrand resigned as minister of foreign affairs in 1807, although the Emperor retained him in the Council of State as Vice-Grand Elector of the Empire. He claimed in his memoirs to have disapproved of Napoleon's Spanish initiative, which resulted in the Peninsular War beginning in 1808, but evidence exists that he was initially an advocate of toppling the House of Bourbon yet later attempted to distance himself from this policy. At the Congress of Erfurt in September\u2013October 1808, Talleyrand secretly counseled Tsar Alexander. The Tsar's attitude towards Napoleon was one of apprehensive opposition. Talleyrand repaired the confidence of the Russian monarch, who rebuked Napoleon's attempts to form a direct anti-Austrian military alliance. Napoleon had expected Talleyrand to help convince the Tsar to accept his proposals and never discovered that Talleyrand was working at cross-purposes. Talleyrand believed Napoleon would eventually destroy the empire he had worked to build across multiple rulers.\nAfter his resignation in 1807 from the ministry, Talleyrand began to accept bribes from hostile powers (mainly Austria, but also Russia), to betray Napoleon's secrets. Talleyrand and Joseph Fouch\u00e9, who were typically enemies in both politics and the salons, had a rapprochement in late 1808 and entered into discussions over the imperial line of succession. Napoleon had yet to address this matter and the two men knew that without a legitimate heir a struggle for power would erupt in the wake of Napoleon's death. Even Talleyrand, who believed that Napoleon's policies were leading France to ruin, understood the necessity of peaceful transitions of power. Napoleon received word of their actions and deemed them treasonous. This perception caused the famous dressing down of Talleyrand in front of Napoleon's marshals, during which Napoleon famously claimed that he could \"break him like a glass, but it's not worth the trouble\" and added with a scatological tone that Talleyrand was \"shit in a silk stocking\", to which the minister coldly retorted, once Napoleon had left, \"Pity that so great a man should have been so badly brought up!\"\nTalleyrand opposed the further harsh treatment of Austria in 1809 after the War of the Fifth Coalition. He was also a critic of the French invasion of Russia in 1812. He was invited to resume his former office in late 1813, but Talleyrand could see that power was slipping from Napoleon's hands. He offered to resign from the council in early 1814, but Napoleon refused the move. Talleyrand then hosted the tsar at the end of March after the fall of Paris, persuaded him that the best chance of stability lay with the House of Bourbon, and gained his support. On 1 April 1814, he led the S\u00e9nat conservateur in establishing a provisional government in Paris, of which he was elected president. On 2 April the Senate officially deposed Napoleon with the Acte de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de l'Empereur; by 11 April, it had approved the Treaty of Fontainebleau and adopted a new constitution to re-establish the Bourbon monarchy.\nBourbon Restoration and July Monarchy.\nWhen Napoleon was succeeded by Louis XVIII in April 1814, Talleyrand was one of the key agents of the restoration of the House of Bourbon, although he opposed the new legislation of Louis's rule. Talleyrand was the chief French negotiator at the Congress of Vienna; earlier that same year he signed the Treaty of Paris. It was due in part to his skills that the terms of the treaty were remarkably lenient towards France. As the Congress opened, the right to make decisions was restricted to four countries: Austria, the United Kingdom, Prussia and Russia. France and other European countries were invited to attend, but were not allowed to influence the process. Talleyrand promptly became the champion of the small countries and demanded admission into the ranks of the decision-making process. The four powers admitted France and Spain to the decision-making backrooms of the conference after a good deal of diplomatic maneuvering by Talleyrand, who had the support of the Spanish representative, Pedro G\u00f3mez Labrador, Marquis of Labrador. Spain was excluded after a while (a result of both the Marquis of Labrador's incompetence as well as the quixotic nature of Spain's agenda), but France (Talleyrand) was allowed to participate until the end. Russia and Prussia sought to enlarge their territory at the Congress. Russia demanded annexation of Poland (already occupied by Russian troops); this demand was finally satisfied, despite protests by France, Austria and the United Kingdom. Austria was afraid of future conflicts with Russia or Prussia and the United Kingdom was opposed to their expansion as well\u2014and Talleyrand managed to take advantage of these contradictions within the former anti-French coalition. On 3 January 1815, a secret treaty was signed by France's Talleyrand, Austria's Metternich and Britain's Castlereagh. By this tract, officially a secret treaty of defensive alliance, the three powers agreed to use force if necessary to \"repulse aggression\" (of Russia and Prussia) and to protect the \"state of security and independence\".\nTalleyrand, having managed to establish a middle position, received some favors from the other countries in exchange for his support: France returned to its 1792 boundaries without reparations, with French control over the papal Comtat Venaissin, County of Montb\u00e9liard, and Salm, which had been independent at the start of the French Revolution in 1789. It would later be debated which outcome would have been better for France: allowing Prussia to annex all of Saxony (Talleyrand ensured that only part of the kingdom would be annexed) or the Rhine provinces. The first option would have kept Prussia farther away from France, but would have needed much more opposition as well. Some historians have argued that Talleyrand's diplomacy wound up establishing the fault lines of World War I, especially as it allowed Prussia to engulf small German states west of the Rhine. This simultaneously placed the Prussian Army at the French-German frontier, for the first time; made Prussia the largest German power in terms of territory, population and the industry of the Ruhr and Rhineland; and eventually helped pave the way to German unification under the Prussian throne. However, at the time Talleyrand's diplomacy was regarded as successful, as it removed the threat of France being partitioned by the victors. Talleyrand also managed to strengthen his own position in France (ultraroyalists had disapproved of the presence of a former \"revolutionary\" and \"murderer of the Duke d'Enghien\" in the royal cabinet).\nNapoleon's return to France in 1815 and his subsequent defeat, the Hundred Days, was a reverse for the diplomatic victories of Talleyrand (who remained in Vienna the whole time). The second peace settlement was markedly less lenient and it was fortunate for France that the business of the Congress had been concluded. Having been appointed foreign minister and president of the council on 9 July 1815, Talleyrand resigned in September of that year, over his objections to the second treaty. Louis XVIII appointed him as the Grand Chamberlain of France, a mostly ceremonial role which provided Talleyrand with a steady income. For the next fifteen years he restricted himself to the role of \"elder statesman\", criticizing and intriguing against Minister of Police \u00c9lie, duc Decazes, Prime Minister Duc de Richelieu and other political opponents from the sidelines. In celebration of the birth of the Duc de Bordeaux, Louis XVIII made Talleyrand a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit.\nIn December 1829, Talleyrand funded the foundation of the \"National\" newspaper. The newspaper was run by his personal friend Adolphe Thiers, alongside Armand Carrel, Fran\u00e7ois Mignet and Stendhal. Its first issue appeared on 3 January 1830, quickly becoming the mouthpiece of the Orl\u00e9anist cause and gaining popularity among the French liberal bourgeoisie. Following the ascent of Louis-Philippe I to the throne in the aftermath of the July Revolution of 1830, Talleyrand reluctantly agreed to become ambassador to the United Kingdom, a post he held from 1830 to 1834. In this role, he strove to reinforce the legitimacy of Louis-Philippe's regime. He played a vital role in the London Conference of 1830, rebuking a partition plan developed by his son Charles de Flahaut and helping bring Leopold of Saxe-Coburg to the throne of the newly independent Kingdom of Belgium. In April 1834, he crowned his diplomatic career by signing the treaty which brought together as allies France, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal.\nAfter resigning from his position as ambassador in London in November 1834, Talleyrand stopped playing an active role in French politics. He split his time between Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay and Saint-Florentin, where he hosted frequent banquets and played whist with his visitors. His physical health began to steadily deteriorate and he began using an armchair on wheels provided to him by Louis Philippe I. He spent most of his time in the company of the Duchess Dino and concerned himself with the education of her daughter Pauline. Talleyrand suffered from bouts of recurring depression which were caused by his concern over his legacy and the development of the Napoleonic myth. To that end he ordered that his autobiography, the \"Memoirs\", be published 30 years after his death. He also sought to gain the friendship of people he believed would shape public opinion in the future, including Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Lady Granville and Alphonse de Lamartine. During the last years of his life Talleyrand began planning his reconciliation with the Catholic Church. On 16 May 1838, he signed a retraction of his errors towards the church and a letter of submission to Pope Gregory XVI. He died the following day at 3:55\u00a0p.m., at Saint-Florentin.\nBy a codicil added to his will on 17 March 1838, Talleyrand left his memoirs and papers to the duchess of Dino and Adolphe de Bacourt. The latter revised them with care, and added to them other pieces emanating from Talleyrand. They fell into some question: first that Talleyrand is known to have destroyed many of his most important papers, and secondly that de Bacourt almost certainly drew up the connected narrative which we now possess from notes which were in more or less of confusion. The were later edited by the duc de Broglie and published in 1891.\nPrivate life.\nTalleyrand had a reputation for promiscuity and as a voluptuary. He left no legitimate children, though he possibly fathered over two dozen illegitimate ones. Four possible children of his have been identified: Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut, generally accepted to be an illegitimate son of Talleyrand; the painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, once rumoured to be Talleyrand's son, though this is doubted by historians who have examined the issue (for example, L\u00e9on No\u00ebl, French ambassador); the \"Mysterious Charlotte\", possibly his daughter by his future wife, Catherine Worl\u00e9e Grand; and Pauline, ostensibly the daughter of the Duke and Duchess Dino. Of these four, only the first is given credence by historians. However, the French historian Emmanuel de Waresquiel has lately given much credibility to father-daughter link between Talleyrand and Pauline whom he referred to as \"my dear Minette\". Thaddeus Stevens \"suffered too from the rumor that he was actually the bastard son of Count Talleyrand, who was said to have visited New England in the year before Stevens' birth. ... Actually Talleyrand did not visit New England till 1794, when Stevens was already two years old.\"\nAristocratic women were a key component of Talleyrand's political tactics, both for their influence and their ability to cross borders unhindered. His presumed lover Germaine de Sta\u00ebl was a major influence on him, and he on her. Though their personal philosophies were most different (she a romantic, he very much unsentimental), she assisted him greatly, most notably by lobbying Barras to permit Talleyrand to return to France from his American exile, and then to have him made foreign minister. He lived with Catherine Worl\u00e9e, born in India and married there to Charles Grand. She had traveled about before settling in Paris in the 1780s, where she lived as a notorious courtesan for several years before divorcing Grand to marry Talleyrand. Talleyrand was in no hurry to marry, and it was after repeated postponements that Napoleon obliged him in 1802 to formalize the relationship or risk his political career. While serving as a high level negotiator at the Congress of Vienna (1814\u20131815), Talleyrand entered into an arrangement with Dorothea von Biron, the wife of his nephew, the Duke of Dino. Shortly after, he separated from Catherine.\nTalleyrand's venality was notorious; in the tradition of the \"ancien r\u00e9gime\", he expected to be paid for the state duties he performed\u2014whether these can properly be called \"bribes\" is open to debate. For example, during the German mediatization, the consolidation of the small German states, a number of German rulers and elites paid him to save their possessions or enlarge their territories. Less successfully, he solicited payments from the United States government to open negotiations, precipitating a diplomatic disaster (the \"XYZ Affair\"). The difference between his diplomatic success in Europe and failure with the United States illustrates that his diplomacy rested firmly on the power of the French army that was a terrible threat to the German states within reach, but lacked the logistics to threaten the US not the least because of the British naval domination of the seas. After Napoleon's defeat, he withdrew claims to the title \"Prince of Benevento\", but was created Duke of Talleyrand with the style \"Prince de Talleyrand\" for life, in the same manner as his estranged wife.\nDescribed by biographer Philip Ziegler as a \"pattern of subtlety and finesse\" and a \"creature of grandeur and guile\", Talleyrand was a great conversationalist, gourmet, and wine connoisseur. He was a frequent visitor at the \"salon\" hosted by Ad\u00e8le de Bellegarde and her sister Aurore, with whom he dined regularly over a period of five years. From 1801 to 1804, he owned Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion in Bordeaux. In 1803, Napoleon ordered Talleyrand to acquire the Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay as a place particularly appropriate for reception of foreign dignitaries, and Talleyrand made it his primary place of residence until his death in 1838. There he employed the renowned French chef Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, one of the first celebrity chefs known as the \"chef of kings and king of chefs\", and was said to have spent an hour every day with him. His Paris residence on the Place de la Concorde, acquired in 1812 and sold to James Mayer de Rothschild in 1838, is now owned by the Embassy of the United States. Talleyrand has been regarded as a traitor because of his support for successive regimes, some of which were mutually hostile. According to French philosopher Simone Weil, criticism of his loyalty is unfounded, as Talleyrand served not every regime as had been said, but in reality \"France behind every regime\".\nNear the end of his life, Talleyrand became interested in Catholicism again while teaching his young granddaughter simple prayers. The Abb\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Dupanloup came to Talleyrand in his last hours, and according to his account Talleyrand made confession and received extreme unction. When the abb\u00e9 tried to anoint Talleyrand's palms, as prescribed by the rite, he turned his hands over to make the priest anoint him on the back of the hands, since he was a bishop. He also signed, in the abb\u00e9's presence, a solemn declaration in which he openly disavowed \"the great errors which \u2026 had troubled and afflicted the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church, and in which he himself had had the misfortune to fall.\" He died on 17 May 1838 and was buried in the Notre-Dame Chapel, near his Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay. Today, when speaking of the art of diplomacy, the phrase \"they are a Talleyrand\" is variously used to describe a statesman of great resourcefulness and craft, or a cynical and conscienceless self-serving politician.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical, L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter\u2014a chemical released by neurons (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain, and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release. Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.\nIn popular culture and media, dopamine is often portrayed as the main chemical of pleasure, but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confers motivational salience; in other words, dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence (i.e., the desirability or aversiveness) of an outcome, which in turn propels the organism's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome.\nOutside the central nervous system, dopamine functions primarily as a local paracrine messenger. In blood vessels, it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator; in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. With the exception of the blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it.\nSeveral important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. Its metabolic precursor L-DOPA can be manufactured; \"Levodopa\", a pure form of L-DOPA, is the most widely used treatment for Parkinson's. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists which reduce dopamine activity. Similar dopamine antagonist drugs are also some of the most effective anti-nausea agents. Restless legs syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are associated with decreased dopamine activity. Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses, but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD. Dopamine itself is available as a manufactured medication for intravenous injection. It is useful in the treatment of severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock. In newborn babies it may be used for hypotension and septic shock.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStructure.\nA dopamine molecule consists of a catechol structure (a benzene ring with two hydroxyl side groups) with one amine group attached via an ethyl chain. As such, dopamine is the simplest possible catecholamine, a family that also includes the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine. The presence of a benzene ring with this amine attachment makes it a substituted phenethylamine, a family that includes numerous psychoactive drugs.\nLike most amines, dopamine is an organic base. As a base, it is generally protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride\u2014that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine powder which is white to yellow in color.\nBiochemistry.\nSynthesis.\nDopamine is synthesized in a restricted set of cell types, mainly neurons and cells in the medulla of the adrenal glands. The primary and minor metabolic pathways respectively are:\nPrimary: -Phenylalanine \u2192 -Tyrosine \u2192 -DOPA \u2192 Dopamine\nMinor: -Phenylalanine \u2192 -Tyrosine \u2192 \"p\"-Tyramine \u2192 Dopamine\nMinor: -Phenylalanine \u2192 \"m\"-Tyrosine \u2192 \"m\"-Tyramine \u2192 Dopamine\nThe direct precursor of dopamine, -DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the essential amino acid phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so are readily available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine is also found in many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.\n-Phenylalanine is converted into -tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, with molecular oxygen (O2) and tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactors. -Tyrosine is converted into -DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, with tetrahydrobiopterin, O2, and iron (Fe2+) as cofactors. -DOPA is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (also known as DOPA decarboxylase), with pyridoxal phosphate as the cofactor.\nDopamine itself is used as precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine. Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase, with O2 and -ascorbic acid as cofactors. Norepinephrine is converted into epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine \"N\"-methyltransferase with \"S\"-adenosyl--methionine as the cofactor.\nSome of the cofactors also require their own synthesis. Deficiency in any required amino acid or cofactor can impair the synthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.\nDegradation.\nDopamine is broken down into inactive metabolites by a set of enzymes\u2014monoamine oxidase (MAO), catechol-\"O\"-methyl transferase (COMT), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), acting in sequence. Both isoforms of monoamine oxidase, MAO-A and MAO-B, effectively metabolize dopamine. Different breakdown pathways exist but the main end-product is homovanillic acid (HVA), which has no known biological activity. From the bloodstream, homovanillic acid is filtered out by the kidneys and then excreted in the urine. The two primary metabolic routes that convert dopamine into HVA are:\nIn clinical research on schizophrenia, measurements of homovanillic acid in plasma have been used to estimate levels of dopamine activity in the brain. A difficulty in this approach however, is separating the high level of plasma homovanillic acid contributed by the metabolism of norepinephrine.\nAlthough dopamine is normally broken down by an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased by the presence of ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.\nFunctions.\nCellular effects.\nDopamine exerts its effects by binding to and activating cell surface receptors. In humans, dopamine has a high binding affinity at dopamine receptors and human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (hTAAR1). In mammals, five subtypes of dopamine receptors have been identified, labeled from D1 to D5. All of them function as metabotropic, G protein-coupled receptors, meaning that they exert their effects via a complex second messenger system. These receptors can be divided into two families, known as D1-like and D2-like. For receptors located on neurons in the nervous system, the ultimate effect of D1-like activation (D1 and D5) can be excitation (via opening of sodium channels) or inhibition (via opening of potassium channels); the ultimate effect of D2-like activation (D2, D3, and D4) is usually inhibition of the target neuron. Consequently, it is incorrect to describe dopamine itself as either excitatory or inhibitory: its effect on a target neuron depends on which types of receptors are present on the membrane of that neuron and on the internal responses of that neuron to the second messenger cAMP. D1 receptors are the most numerous dopamine receptors in the human nervous system; D2 receptors are next; D3, D4, and D5 receptors are present at significantly lower levels.\nStorage, release, and reuptake.\nInside the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled by a set of mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the cytosol into secretory vesicles, including synaptic vesicles, small and large dense core vesicles by a solute carrier\u2014a vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft. In most cases, the release of dopamine occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials, but it can also be caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine reuptake inhibition and efflux as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.\nOnce in the synapse, dopamine binds to and activates dopamine receptors. These can be postsynaptic dopamine receptors, which are located on dendrites (the postsynaptic neuron), or presynaptic autoreceptors (e.g., the D2sh and presynaptic D3 receptors), which are located on the membrane of an axon terminal (the presynaptic neuron). After the postsynaptic neuron elicits an action potential, dopamine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors. They are then absorbed back into the presynaptic cell, via reuptake mediated either by the dopamine transporter or by the plasma membrane monoamine transporter. Once back in the cytosol, dopamine can either be broken down by a monoamine oxidase or repackaged into vesicles by VMAT2, making it available for future release.\nIn the brain the level of extracellular dopamine is modulated by two mechanisms: phasic and tonic transmission. Phasic dopamine release, like most neurotransmitter release in the nervous system, is driven directly by action potentials in the dopamine-containing cells. Tonic dopamine transmission occurs when small amounts of dopamine are released without being preceded by presynaptic action potentials. Tonic transmission is regulated by a variety of factors, including the activity of other neurons and neurotransmitter reuptake.\nCentral nervous system.\nInside the brain, dopamine plays important roles in executive functions, motor control, motivation, arousal, reinforcement, and reward, as well as lower-level functions including lactation, sexual gratification, and nausea. The dopaminergic cell groups and pathways make up the dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.\nDopaminergic neurons (dopamine-producing nerve cells) are comparatively few in number\u2014a total of around 400,000 in the human brain\u2014and their cell bodies are confined in groups to a few relatively small brain areas. However their axons project to many other brain areas, and they exert powerful effects on their targets. These dopaminergic cell groups were first mapped in 1964 by Annica Dahlstr\u00f6m and Kjell Fuxe, who assigned them labels starting with the letter \"A\" (for \"aminergic\"). In their scheme, areas A1 through A7 contain the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, whereas A8 through A14 contain dopamine. The dopaminergic areas they identified are the substantia nigra (groups 8 and 9); the ventral tegmental area (group 10); the posterior hypothalamus (group 11); the arcuate nucleus (group 12); the zona incerta (group 13) and the periventricular nucleus (group 14).\nThe substantia nigra is a small midbrain area that forms a component of the basal ganglia. This has two parts\u2014an input area called the pars reticulata and an output area called the pars compacta. The dopaminergic neurons are found mainly in the pars compacta (cell group A8) and nearby (group A9). In humans, the projection of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the dorsal striatum, termed the \"nigrostriatal pathway\", plays a significant role in the control of motor function and in learning new motor skills. These neurons are especially vulnerable to damage, and when a large number of them die, the result is a parkinsonian syndrome.\nThe ventral tegmental area (VTA) is another midbrain area. The most prominent group of VTA dopaminergic neurons projects to the prefrontal cortex via the mesocortical pathway and another smaller group projects to the nucleus accumbens via the mesolimbic pathway. Together, these two pathways are collectively termed the \"mesocorticolimbic projection\". The VTA also sends dopaminergic projections to the amygdala, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Mesocorticolimbic neurons play a central role in reward and other aspects of motivation. Accumulating literature shows that dopamine also plays a crucial role in aversive learning through its effects on a number of brain regions.\nThe posterior hypothalamus has dopamine neurons that project to the spinal cord, but their function is not well established. There is some evidence that pathology in this area plays a role in restless legs syndrome, a condition in which people have difficulty sleeping due to an overwhelming compulsion to constantly move parts of the body, especially the legs.\nThe arcuate nucleus and the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus have dopamine neurons that form an important projection\u2014the \"tuberoinfundibular pathway\" which goes to the pituitary gland, where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland. The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, in the absence of dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion.\nThe zona incerta, grouped between the arcuate and periventricular nuclei, projects to several areas of the hypothalamus, and participates in the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which is necessary to activate the development of the male and female reproductive systems, following puberty.\nAn additional group of dopamine-secreting neurons is found in the retina of the eye. These neurons are amacrine cells, meaning that they have no axons. They release dopamine into the extracellular medium, and are specifically active during daylight hours, becoming silent at night. This retinal dopamine acts to enhance the activity of cone cells in the retina while suppressing rod cells\u2014the result is to increase sensitivity to color and contrast during bright light conditions, at the cost of reduced sensitivity when the light is dim.\nBasal ganglia.\nThe largest and most important sources of dopamine in the vertebrate brain are the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. Both structures are components of the midbrain, closely related to each other and functionally similar in many respects. The largest component of the basal ganglia is the striatum. The substantia nigra sends a dopaminergic projection to the dorsal striatum, while the ventral tegmental area sends a similar type of dopaminergic projection to the ventral striatum.\nProgress in understanding the functions of the basal ganglia has been slow. The most popular hypotheses, broadly stated, propose that the basal ganglia play a central role in action selection. The action selection theory in its simplest form proposes that when a person or animal is in a situation where several behaviors are possible, activity in the basal ganglia determines which of them is executed, by releasing that response from inhibition while continuing to inhibit other motor systems that if activated would generate competing behaviors. Thus the basal ganglia, in this concept, are responsible for initiating behaviors, but not for determining the details of how they are carried out. In other words, they essentially form a decision-making system.\nThe basal ganglia can be divided into several sectors, and each is involved in controlling particular types of actions. The ventral sector of the basal ganglia (containing the ventral striatum and ventral tegmental area) operates at the highest level of the hierarchy, selecting actions at the whole-organism level. The dorsal sectors (containing the dorsal striatum and substantia nigra) operate at lower levels, selecting the specific muscles and movements that are used to implement a given behavior pattern.\nDopamine contributes to the action selection process in at least two important ways. First, it sets the \"threshold\" for initiating actions. The higher the level of dopamine activity, the lower the impetus required to evoke a given behavior. As a consequence, high levels of dopamine lead to high levels of motor activity and impulsive behavior; low levels of dopamine lead to torpor and slowed reactions. Parkinson's disease, in which dopamine levels in the substantia nigra circuit are greatly reduced, is characterized by stiffness and difficulty initiating movement\u2014however, when people with the disease are confronted with strong stimuli such as a serious threat, their reactions can be as vigorous as those of a healthy person. In the opposite direction, drugs that increase dopamine release, such as cocaine or amphetamine, can produce heightened levels of activity, including, at the extreme, psychomotor agitation and stereotyped movements.\nThe second important effect of dopamine is as a \"teaching\" signal. When an action is followed by an increase in dopamine activity, the basal ganglia circuit is altered in a way that makes the same response easier to evoke when similar situations arise in the future. This is a form of operant conditioning, in which dopamine plays the role of a reward signal.\nReward.\nIn the language used to discuss the reward system, \"reward\" is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior (also known as approach behavior) and consummatory behavior. A rewarding stimulus is one that can induce the organism to approach it and choose to consume it. Pleasure, learning (e.g., classical and operant conditioning), and approach behavior are the three main functions of reward. As an aspect of reward, \"pleasure\" provides a definition of reward; however, while all pleasurable stimuli are rewarding, not all rewarding stimuli are pleasurable (e.g., extrinsic rewards like money). The motivational or desirable aspect of rewarding stimuli is reflected by the approach behavior that they induce, whereas the pleasure from intrinsic rewards results from consuming them after acquiring them. A neuropsychological model which distinguishes these two components of an intrinsically rewarding stimulus is the incentive salience model, where \"wanting\" or desire (less commonly, \"seeking\") corresponds to appetitive or approach behavior while \"liking\" or pleasure corresponds to consummatory behavior. In human drug addicts, \"wanting\" becomes dissociated with \"liking\" as the desire to use an addictive drug increases, while the pleasure obtained from consuming it decreases due to drug tolerance.\nWithin the brain, dopamine functions partly as a global reward signal. An initial dopamine response to a rewarding stimulus encodes information about the salience, value, and context of a reward. In the context of reward-related learning, dopamine also functions as a \"reward prediction error\" signal, that is, the degree to which the value of a reward is unexpected. According to this hypothesis proposed by Montague, Dayan, and Sejnowski, rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells, but rewards that are unexpected, or greater than expected, produce a short-lasting increase in synaptic dopamine, whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level. The \"prediction error\" hypothesis has drawn particular interest from computational neuroscientists, because an influential computational-learning method known as temporal difference learning makes heavy use of a signal that encodes prediction error. This confluence of theory and data has led to a fertile interaction between neuroscientists and computer scientists interested in machine learning.\nEvidence from microelectrode recordings from the brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by a wide variety of rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system. The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA\u2013nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience (\"want\") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA\u2013prefrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA\u2013amygdala and VTA\u2013hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA\u2013nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra\u2013dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.\nPleasure.\nWhile dopamine has a central role in causing \"wanting,\" associated with the appetitive or approach behavioral responses to rewarding stimuli, detailed studies have shown that dopamine cannot simply be equated with hedonic \"liking\" or pleasure, as reflected in the consummatory behavioral response. Dopamine neurotransmission is involved in some but not all aspects of pleasure-related cognition, since pleasure centers have been identified both within the dopamine system (i.e., nucleus accumbens shell) and outside the dopamine system (i.e., ventral pallidum and parabrachial nucleus). For example, direct electrical stimulation of dopamine pathways, using electrodes implanted in the brain, is experienced as pleasurable, and many types of animals are willing to work to obtain it. Antipsychotic drugs reduce dopamine levels and tend to cause anhedonia, a diminished ability to experience pleasure. Many types of pleasurable experiences\u2014such as sexual intercourse, eating, and playing video games\u2014increase dopamine release. All addictive drugs directly or indirectly affect dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens; these drugs increase drug \"wanting\", leading to compulsive drug use, when repeatedly taken in high doses, presumably through the sensitization of incentive-salience. Drugs that increase synaptic dopamine concentrations include psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. These produce increases in \"wanting\" behaviors, but do not greatly alter expressions of pleasure or change levels of satiation. However, opiate drugs such as heroin and morphine produce increases in expressions of \"liking\" and \"wanting\" behaviors. Moreover, animals in which the ventral tegmental dopamine system has been rendered inactive do not seek food, and will starve to death if left to themselves, but if food is placed in their mouths they will consume it and show expressions indicative of pleasure.\nA clinical study from January 2019 that assessed the effect of a dopamine precursor (levodopa), dopamine antagonist (risperidone), and a placebo on reward responses to music\u00a0\u2013 including the degree of pleasure experienced during musical chills, as measured by changes in electrodermal activity as well as subjective ratings\u00a0\u2013 found that the manipulation of dopamine neurotransmission bidirectionally regulates pleasure cognition (specifically, the hedonic impact of music) in human subjects. This research demonstrated that increased dopamine neurotransmission acts as a \"sine qua non\" condition for pleasurable hedonic reactions to music in humans.\nA study published in Nature in 1998 found evidence that playing video games releases dopamine in the human striatum. This dopamine is associated with learning, behavior reinforcement, attention, and sensorimotor integration. Researchers used positron emission tomography scans and 11C-labelled raclopride to track dopamine levels in the brain during goal-directed motor tasks and found that dopamine release was positively correlated with task performance and was greatest in the ventral striatum. This was the first study to demonstrate the behavioral conditions under which dopamine is released in humans. It highlights the ability of positron emission tomography to detect neurotransmitter fluxes during changes in behavior. According to research, potentially problematic video game use is related to personality traits such as low self-esteem and low self-efficacy, anxiety, aggression, and clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. Additionally, the reasons individuals play video games vary and may include coping, socialization, and personal satisfaction. The DSM-5 defines Internet Gaming Disorder as a mental disorder closely related to Gambling Disorder. This has been supported by some researchers but has also caused controversy.\nOutside the central nervous system.\nDopamine does not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, so its synthesis and functions in peripheral areas are to a large degree independent of its synthesis and functions in the brain. A substantial amount of dopamine circulates in the bloodstream, but its functions there are not entirely clear. Dopamine is found in blood plasma at levels comparable to those of epinephrine, but in humans, over 95% of the dopamine in the plasma is in the form of dopamine sulfate, a conjugate produced by the enzyme sulfotransferase 1A3/1A4 acting on free dopamine. The bulk of this dopamine sulfate is produced in the mesenteric organs. The production of dopamine sulfate is thought to be a mechanism for detoxifying dopamine that is ingested as food or produced by the digestive process\u2014levels in the plasma typically rise more than fifty-fold after a meal. Dopamine sulfate has no known biological functions and is excreted in urine.\nThe relatively small quantity of unconjugated dopamine in the bloodstream may be produced by the sympathetic nervous system, the digestive system, or possibly other organs. It may act on dopamine receptors in peripheral tissues, or be metabolized, or be converted to norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine beta hydroxylase, which is released into the bloodstream by the adrenal medulla. Some dopamine receptors are located in the walls of arteries, where they act as a vasodilator and an inhibitor of norepinephrine release from postganglionic sympathetic nerves terminals (dopamine can inhibit norepinephrine release by acting on presynaptic dopamine receptors, and also on presynaptic \u03b1-1 receptors, like norepinephrine itself). These responses might be activated by dopamine released from the carotid body under conditions of low oxygen, but whether arterial dopamine receptors perform other biologically useful functions is not known.\nBeyond its role in modulating blood flow, there are several peripheral systems in which dopamine circulates within a limited area and performs an exocrine or paracrine function. The peripheral systems in which dopamine plays an important role include the immune system, the kidneys and the pancreas.\nImmune system.\nIn the immune system dopamine acts upon receptors present on immune cells, especially lymphocytes. Dopamine can also affect immune cells in the spleen, bone marrow, and circulatory system. In addition, dopamine can be synthesized and released by immune cells themselves. The main effect of dopamine on lymphocytes is to reduce their activation level. The functional significance of this system is unclear, but it affords a possible route for interactions between the nervous system and immune system, and may be relevant to some autoimmune disorders.\nKidneys.\nThe renal dopaminergic system is located in the cells of the nephron in the kidney, where all subtypes of dopamine receptors are present. Dopamine is also synthesized there, by tubule cells, and discharged into the tubular fluid. Its actions include increasing the blood supply to the kidneys, increasing the glomerular filtration rate, and increasing the excretion of sodium in the urine. Hence, defects in renal dopamine function can lead to reduced sodium excretion and consequently result in the development of high blood pressure. There is strong evidence that faults in the production of dopamine or in the receptors can result in a number of pathologies including oxidative stress, edema, and either genetic or essential hypertension. Oxidative stress can itself cause hypertension. Defects in the system can also be caused by genetic factors or high blood pressure.\nPancreas.\nIn the pancreas the role of dopamine is somewhat complex. The pancreas consists of two parts, an exocrine and an endocrine component. The exocrine part synthesizes and secretes digestive enzymes and other substances, including dopamine, into the small intestine. The function of this secreted dopamine after it enters the small intestine is not clearly established\u2014the possibilities include protecting the intestinal mucosa from damage and reducing gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system).\nThe pancreatic islets make up the endocrine part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin into the bloodstream. There is evidence that the beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts to reduce the amount of insulin they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established\u2014it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.\nMedical uses.\nDopamine as a manufactured medication is sold under the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is most commonly used as a stimulant drug in the treatment of severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. It is especially important in treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short\u2014approximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn infants and up to five minutes in preterm infants\u2014it is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection.\nIts effects, depending on dosage, include an increase in sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, and an increase in blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at \u03b11, \u03b21, and \u03b22 adrenergic receptors as a weak agonist.\nSide effects of dopamine include negative effects on kidney function and irregular heartbeats. The LD50, or lethal dose which is expected to prove fatal in 50% of the population, has been found to be: 59\u00a0mg/kg (mouse; administered intravenously); 95\u00a0mg/kg (mouse; administered intraperitoneally); 163\u00a0mg/kg (rat; administered intraperitoneally); 79\u00a0mg/kg (dog; administered intravenously).\nDisease, disorders, and pharmacology.\nThe dopamine system plays a central role in several significant medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and addiction. Aside from dopamine itself, there are many other important drugs that act on dopamine systems in various parts of the brain or body. Some are used for medical or recreational purposes, but neurochemists have also developed a variety of research drugs, some of which bind with high affinity to specific types of dopamine receptors and either agonize or antagonize their effects, and many that affect other aspects of dopamine physiology, including dopamine transporter inhibitors, VMAT inhibitors, and enzyme inhibitors.\nAging brain.\nA number of studies have reported an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions. Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.\nMultiple sclerosis.\nStudies reported that dopamine imbalance influences the fatigue in multiple sclerosis. In patients with multiple sclerosis, dopamine inhibits production of IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\nParkinson's disease.\nParkinson's disease is an age-related disorder characterized by movement disorders such as stiffness of the body, slowing of movement, and trembling of limbs when they are not in use. In advanced stages it progresses to dementia and eventually death. The main symptoms are caused by the loss of dopamine-secreting cells in the substantia nigra. These dopamine cells are especially vulnerable to damage, and a variety of insults, including encephalitis (as depicted in the book and movie \"Awakenings\"), repeated sports-related concussions, and some forms of chemical poisoning such as MPTP, can lead to substantial cell loss, producing a parkinsonian syndrome that is similar in its main features to Parkinson's disease. Most cases of Parkinson's disease, however, are idiopathic, meaning that the cause of cell death cannot be identified.\nThe most widely used treatment for parkinsonism is administration of L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor for dopamine. L-DOPA is converted to dopamine in the brain and various parts of the body by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. L-DOPA is used rather than dopamine itself because, unlike dopamine, it is capable of crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier. It is often co-administered with an enzyme inhibitor of peripheral decarboxylation such as carbidopa or benserazide, to reduce the amount converted to dopamine in the periphery and thereby increase the amount of L-DOPA that enters the brain. When L-DOPA is administered regularly over a long time period, a variety of unpleasant side effects such as dyskinesia often begin to appear; even so, it is considered the best available long-term treatment option for most cases of Parkinson's disease.\nL-DOPA treatment cannot restore the dopamine cells that have been lost, but it causes the remaining cells to produce more dopamine, thereby compensating for the loss to at least some degree. In advanced stages the treatment begins to fail because the cell loss is so severe that the remaining ones cannot produce enough dopamine regardless of L-DOPA levels. Other drugs that enhance dopamine function, such as bromocriptine and pergolide, are also sometimes used to treat Parkinsonism, but in most cases L-DOPA appears to give the best trade-off between positive effects and negative side-effects.\nDopaminergic medications that are used to treat Parkinson's disease are sometimes associated with the development of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which involves the overuse of dopaminergic medication and medication-induced compulsive engagement in natural rewards like gambling and sexual activity. The latter behaviors are similar to those observed in individuals with a behavioral addiction.\nDrug addiction and psychostimulants.\nCocaine, substituted amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), and other psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine levels in the brain by a variety of mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.\nThe effects of psychostimulants include increases in heart rate, body temperature, and sweating; improvements in alertness, attention, and endurance; increases in pleasure produced by rewarding events; but at higher doses agitation, anxiety, or even loss of contact with reality. Drugs in this group can have a high addiction potential, due to their activating effects on the dopamine-mediated reward system in the brain. However some can also be useful, at lower doses, for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. An important differentiating factor is the onset and duration of action. Cocaine can take effect in seconds if it is injected or inhaled in free base form; the effects last from 5 to 90 minutes. This rapid and brief action makes its effects easily perceived and consequently gives it high addiction potential. Methylphenidate taken in pill form, in contrast, can take two hours to reach peak levels in the bloodstream, and depending on formulation the effects can last for up to 12\u00a0hours. These longer acting formulations have the benefit of reducing the potential for abuse, and improving adherence for treatment by using more convenient dosage regimens.\nA variety of addictive drugs produce an increase in reward-related dopamine activity. Stimulants such as nicotine, cocaine and methamphetamine promote increased levels of dopamine which appear to be the primary factor in causing addiction. For other addictive drugs such as the opioid heroin, the increased levels of dopamine in the reward system may play only a minor role in addiction. When people addicted to stimulants go through withdrawal, they do not experience the physical suffering associated with alcohol withdrawal or withdrawal from opiates; instead they experience craving, an intense desire for the drug characterized by irritability, restlessness, and other arousal symptoms, brought about by psychological dependence.\nThe dopamine system plays a crucial role in several aspects of addiction. At the earliest stage, genetic differences that alter the expression of dopamine receptors in the brain can predict whether a person will find stimulants appealing or aversive. Consumption of stimulants produces increases in brain dopamine levels that last from minutes to hours. Finally, the chronic elevation in dopamine that comes with repetitive high-dose stimulant consumption triggers a wide-ranging set of structural changes in the brain that are responsible for the behavioral abnormalities which characterize an addiction. Treatment of stimulant addiction is very difficult, because even if consumption ceases, the craving that comes with psychological withdrawal does not. Even when the craving seems to be extinct, it may re-emerge when faced with stimuli that are associated with the drug, such as friends, locations and situations. Association networks in the brain are greatly interlinked.\nPsychosis and antipsychotic drugs.\nPsychiatrists in the early 1950s discovered that a class of drugs known as typical antipsychotics (also known as major tranquilizers), were often effective at reducing the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. The introduction of the first widely used antipsychotic, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), in the 1950s, led to the release of many patients with schizophrenia from institutions in the years that followed. By the 1970s researchers understood that these typical antipsychotics worked as antagonists on the D2 receptors. This realization led to the so-called dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, which postulates that schizophrenia is largely caused by hyperactivity of brain dopamine systems. The dopamine hypothesis drew additional support from the observation that psychotic symptoms were often intensified by dopamine-enhancing stimulants such as methamphetamine, and that these drugs could also produce psychosis in healthy people if taken in large enough doses. In the following decades other atypical antipsychotics that had fewer serious side effects were developed. Many of these newer drugs do not act directly on dopamine receptors, but instead produce alterations in dopamine activity indirectly. These drugs were also used to treat other psychoses. Antipsychotic drugs have a broadly suppressive effect on most types of active behavior, and particularly reduce the delusional and agitated behavior characteristic of overt psychosis.\nLater observations, however, have caused the dopamine hypothesis to lose popularity, at least in its simple original form. For one thing, patients with schizophrenia do not typically show measurably increased levels of brain dopamine activity. Even so, many psychiatrists and neuroscientists continue to believe that schizophrenia involves some sort of dopamine system dysfunction. As the \"dopamine hypothesis\" has evolved over time, however, the sorts of dysfunctions it postulates have tended to become increasingly subtle and complex.\nPsychopharmacologist Stephen M. Stahl suggested in a review of 2018 that in many cases of psychosis, including schizophrenia, three interconnected networks based on dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate \u2013 each on its own or in various combinations \u2013 contributed to an overexcitation of dopamine D2 receptors in the ventral striatum.\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nAltered dopamine neurotransmission is implicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition associated with impaired cognitive control, in turn leading to problems with regulating attention (attentional control), inhibiting behaviors (inhibitory control), and forgetting things or missing details (working memory), among other problems. There are genetic links between dopamine receptors, the dopamine transporter, and ADHD, in addition to links to other neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. The most important relationship between dopamine and ADHD involves the drugs that are used to treat ADHD. Some of the most effective therapeutic agents for ADHD are psychostimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) and amphetamine (Evekeo, Adderall, Dexedrine), drugs that increase both dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. The clinical effects of these psychostimulants in treating ADHD are mediated through the indirect activation of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, specifically dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor \u03b12, in the prefrontal cortex.\nPain.\nDopamine plays a role in pain processing in multiple levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.\nNausea.\nNausea and vomiting are largely determined by activity in the area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, as well as other dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.\nFear and anxiety\nSimultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have shown that the amount of dopamine release is dependent on the strength of conditioned fear response and is linearly coupled to learning-induced activity in the amygdala. Dopamine is generally linked to reward learning, but it also plays a key role in fear learning and extinction by helping to form, store and update fear memories through its interaction with other brain regions like amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and striatum.\nComparative biology and evolution.\nMicroorganisms.\nThere are no reports of dopamine in archaea, but it has been detected in some types of bacteria and in the protozoan called \"Tetrahymena\". Perhaps more importantly, there are types of bacteria that contain homologs of all the enzymes that animals use to synthesize dopamine. It has been proposed that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria, via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time, perhaps as a result of the symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria.\nAnimals.\nDopamine is used as a neurotransmitter in most multicellular animals. In sponges there is only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian Period. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.\nIn every type of animal that has been examined, dopamine has been seen to modify motor behavior. In the model organism, nematode \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", it reduces locomotion and increases food-exploratory movements; in flatworms it produces \"screw-like\" movements; in leeches it inhibits swimming and promotes crawling. Across a wide range of vertebrates, dopamine has an \"activating\" effect on behavior-switching and response selection, comparable to its effect in mammals.\nDopamine has also consistently been shown to play a role in reward learning, in all animal groups. As in all vertebrates \u2013 invertebrates such as roundworms, flatworms, molluscs and common fruit flies can all be trained to repeat an action if it is consistently followed by an increase in dopamine levels. In fruit flies, distinct elements for reward learning suggest a modular structure to the insect reward processing system that broadly parallels that in the mammalian one. For example, dopamine regulates short- and long-term learning in monkeys; in fruit flies, different groups of dopamine neurons mediate reward signals for short- and long-term memories.\nIt had long been believed that arthropods were an exception to this with dopamine being seen as having an adverse effect. Reward was seen to be mediated instead by octopamine, a neurotransmitter closely related to norepinephrine. More recent studies, however, have shown that dopamine does play a part in reward learning in fruit flies. It has also been found that the rewarding effect of octopamine is due to its activating a set of dopaminergic neurons not previously accessed in the research. Dopamine can also be found in cephalopod ink.\nPlants.\nMany plants, including a variety of food plants, synthesize dopamine to varying degrees. The highest concentrations have been observed in bananas\u2014the fruit pulp of red and yellow bananas contains dopamine at levels of 40 to 50 parts per million by weight. Potatoes, avocados, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts may also contain dopamine at levels of 1 part per million or more; oranges, tomatoes, spinach, beans, and other plants contain measurable concentrations less than 1 part per million. The dopamine in plants is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine, by biochemical mechanisms similar to those that animals use. It can be metabolized in a variety of ways, producing melanin and a variety of alkaloids as byproducts. The functions of plant catecholamines have not been clearly established, but there is evidence that they play a role in the response to stressors such as bacterial infection, act as growth-promoting factors in some situations, and modify the way that sugars are metabolized. The receptors that mediate these actions have not yet been identified, nor have the intracellular mechanisms that they activate.\nDopamine consumed in food cannot act on the brain, because it cannot cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. However, there are also a variety of plants that contain L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor of dopamine. The highest concentrations are found in the leaves and bean pods of plants of the genus \"Mucuna\", especially in \"Mucuna pruriens\" (velvet beans), which have been used as a source for L-DOPA as a drug. Another plant containing substantial amounts of L-DOPA is \"Vicia faba\", the plant that produces fava beans (also known as \"broad beans\"). The level of L-DOPA in the beans, however, is much lower than in the pod shells and other parts of the plant. The seeds of \"Cassia\" and \"Bauhinia\" trees also contain substantial amounts of L-DOPA.\nIn a species of marine green algae \"Ulvaria obscura\", a major component of some algal blooms, dopamine is present in very high concentrations, estimated at 4.4% of dry weight. There is evidence that this dopamine functions as an anti-herbivore defense, reducing consumption by snails and isopods.\nAs a precursor for melanin.\nMelanins are a family of dark-pigmented substances found in a wide range of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.\nDopamine-derived melanin probably appears in at least some other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in plants is likely to be used as a precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white stripes on the bodies of insect larvae, are also thought to be caused by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.\nHistory and development.\nDopamine was first synthesized in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first identified in the human brain by Katharine Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine because it is a monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-\u00c5ke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.\nPolydopamine.\nResearch motivated by adhesive polyphenolic proteins in mussels led to the discovery in 2007 that a wide variety of materials, if placed in a solution of dopamine at slightly basic pH, will become coated with a layer of polymerized dopamine, often referred to as polydopamine. This polymerized dopamine forms by a spontaneous oxidation reaction, and is formally a type of melanin. Furthermore, dopamine self-polymerization can be used to modulate the mechanical properties of peptide-based gels. Synthesis of polydopamine usually involves reaction of dopamine hydrochloride with Tris as a base in water. The structure of polydopamine is unknown.\nPolydopamine coatings can form on objects ranging in size from nanoparticles to large surfaces. Polydopamine layers have chemical properties that have the potential to be extremely useful, and numerous studies have examined their possible applications. At the simplest level, they can be used for protection against damage by light, or to form capsules for drug delivery. At a more sophisticated level, their adhesive properties may make them useful as substrates for biosensors or other biologically active macromolecules.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some of the key aims of the OAU were to encourage political and economic integration among member states, and to eradicate colonialism and neo-colonialism from the African continent.\nThe absence of an armed force like the United Nations peacekeepers left the organization with no means to enforce its decisions. It was also unwilling to become involved in the internal affairs of member nations, prompting some critics to claim the OAU as ineffective in taking decisive action. Recognising this, in September 1999 the OAU issued the Sirte Declaration, calling for a new body to take its place. On 9 July 2002, the OAU's Chairman, South African President Thabo Mbeki, formally dissolved the OAU and replaced it with the African Union (AU), its immediate successor, which upholds many of the founding principles of the OAU.\nHistory.\nThe inception of the OAU's establishment was the Sanniquellie Pledge at the First West African Summit Conference held in Sanniquellie, Liberia on 15\u201319 July 1959. President Tubman of Liberia hosted President Tour\u00e9 of Guinea, and Prime Minister Nkrumah of Ghana, and the three pledged to work together for the formation of a \"Community of Independent African States\".\nThe OAU was founded in May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, by 32 African states with the main aim of bringing the African nations together and resolve the issues within the continent. Its first ever conference was held on 1 May 1963 in Addis Ababa. At that conference, the late Gambian historian\u00a0\u2013 and one of the leading Gambian nationalists and Pan-Africanists at the time\u00a0\u2013 Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof delivered a speech in front of the member states, in which he said:\nIt is barely 75 years when the European Powers sat around the table in Germany each holding a dagger to carve up Africa for its own benefit.\u2026 Your success will inspire and speed up the freedom and total independence of the African continent and eradicate imperialism and colonialism from the continent and eventually neo-colonialism from the globe\u2026 Your failure, which no true African in Africa is praying for, will prolong our struggle with bitterness and disappointment. I, therefore, adjure that you ignore any suggestion outside Africa and holding that the present civilisation, which some of the big powered are boasting of, sprang up from Africa, and realising that the entire world has something earthly to learn from Africa, you would endeavour your utmost to come to agreement, save Africa from the clutches of neo-colonialism and resurrect African dignity, manhood and national stability.\nAims.\nThe OAU had the following primary aims:\nA Liberation Committee was established to aid independence movements and look after the interests of already-independent states. The OAU also aimed to stay neutral in terms of global politics, which would prevent them from being controlled once more by outside forces \u2013 an especial danger with the Cold War.\nThe OAU had other aims, too:\nSoon after achieving independence, a number of African states expressed a growing desire for more unity within the continent. Not everyone was agreed on how this unity could be achieved, however, and two opinionated groups emerged in this respect:\nSome of the initial discussions took place at Sanniquellie, Liberia. The dispute was eventually resolved when Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I invited the two groups to Addis Ababa, where the OAU and its headquarters were subsequently established. The Charter of the Organisation was signed by 32 independent African states.\nAt the time of the OAU's disbanding, 53 out of the 54 African states were members; Morocco left on 12 November 1984 following the admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic as the government of Western Sahara in 1982.\nCriticism and praise.\nThe organisation was widely derided as a bureaucratic \"talking shop\" with little power. It struggled to enforce its decisions, and its lack of armed force made intervention exceedingly difficult. Civil wars in Nigeria and Angola continued unabated for years, and the OAU could do nothing to stop them.\nThe policy of non-interference in the affairs of member states also limited the effectiveness of the OAU. Thus, when human rights were violated, as in Uganda under Idi Amin in the 1970s, the OAU was powerless to stop them.\nThe Organisation was praised by Ghanaian former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan for bringing Africans together. Nevertheless, critics argue that, in its 39 years of existence, the OAU did little to protect the rights and liberties of African citizens from their own political leaders, often dubbing it as a \"Dictators' Club\" or \"Dictators' Trade Union\".\nThe OAU was, however, successful in some respects. Many of its members were members of the UN, too, and they stood together within the latter organisation to safeguard African interests \u2013 especially in respect of lingering colonialism. Its pursuit of African unity, therefore, was in some ways successful.\nTotal unity was difficult to achieve, however, as the OAU was largely divided. The former French colonies, still dependent on France, had formed the Monrovia Group, and there was a further split between those that supported the United States and those that supported the USSR in the Cold War of ideologies. The pro-Socialist faction was led by Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, while F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny of the Ivory Coast led the pro-capitalists. Because of these divisions, it was difficult for the OAU to take action against states involved in internal conflicts because it could rarely reach an agreement on what was to be done.\nThe OAU did play a pivotal role in eradicating colonialism and white minority rule in Africa. It gave weapons, training and military bases to rebel groups fighting white minority and colonial rule. Groups such as the ANC and PAC, fighting apartheid, and ZANU and ZAPU, fighting to topple the government of Rhodesia, were aided in their endeavours by the OAU. African harbours were closed to the South African government, and South African aircraft were prohibited from flying over the rest of the continent. The UN was convinced by the OAU to expel South Africa from bodies such as the World Health Organization.\nThe OAU also worked with the UN to ease refugee problems. It set up the African Development Bank for economic projects intended to make Africa financially stronger. Although all African countries eventually won their independence, it remained difficult for them to become totally independent of their former colonisers. There was often continued reliance on the former colonial powers for economic aid, which often came with strings attached: loans had to be paid back at high interest-rates, and goods had to be sold to the aiders at low rates.\nThe US and Soviet Union intervened in post-colonial Africa in pursuit of their own objectives. Help was sometimes provided in the form of technology and aid-workers. Despite the goodwill and best intentions, the OAU consistently failed at its stated goal - that of the fight to keep \"Westerners\" (colonialists) out of, and only focus upon, African affairs. The Organisation still heavily depended on Western help (military and economic) to intervene in African affairs, despite African leaders' displeasure at dealing with the international community, especially Western countries.\nAgencies.\nAutonomous specialised agencies, working under the auspices of the OAU, were:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The railroad started as a narrow-gauge line running south from Denver, Colorado, in 1870. It served mainly as a transcontinental bridge line between Denver and Ogden, Utah. The Rio Grande was also a major origin of coal and mineral traffic.\nThe Rio Grande was a strong example of mountain railroading, with a motto of \"Through the Rockies, not around them\" and later \"Main line through the Rockies\", both referring to the Rocky Mountains.\nThe D&amp;RGW operated the highest mainline rail line in the United States, over the Tennessee Pass in Colorado, and the famed routes through the Moffat Tunnel and the Royal Gorge. At its height, in 1889, the D&amp;RGW had the largest narrow-gauge railroad network in North America with of track interconnecting the states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. Known for its independence, the D&amp;RGW operated the \"Rio Grande Zephyr\" until its discontinuation in 1983. This was the last private intercity passenger train in the United States until Brightline began service in Florida in 2018.\nIn 1988, the Rio Grande's parent corporation, Rio Grande Industries, purchased Southern Pacific Transportation Company, and as the result of a merger, the larger Southern Pacific Railroad name was chosen for identity. The Rio Grande operated as a separate division of the Southern Pacific until 1992. Today, most former D&amp;RGW main lines are owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad while several branch lines are now operated as heritage railways by various companies.\nHistory.\nOverview.\nThe Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railway (D&amp;RG) was incorporated on October27, 1870, by General William Jackson Palmer (1836\u20131909), and a board of four directors. It was originally announced that the new railroad would proceed south from Denver and travel an estimated south to El Paso via Pueblo, westward along the Arkansas River, and continue southward through the San Luis Valley of Colorado toward the Rio Grande. Closely assisted by his friend and new business partner Dr. William Bell, Palmer's new \"Baby Road\" laid the first rails out of Denver on July28, 1871, and reached the location of the new town of Colorado Springs (then the Fountain Colony) by October21. Narrow gauge was chosen in part because construction and equipment costs would be relatively more affordable when weighed against that of the prevailing standard gauge. Palmer's first hand impressions of the Ffestiniog Railway in Wales buoyed his interest in the narrow-gauge concept which would prove to be advantageous while conquering the mountainous regions of the Southwest. Eventually the route of the D&amp;RG would be amended (including a plan to continue south from Pueblo over Raton Pass) and added to as new opportunities and competition challenged the railroad's expanding goals.\nFeverish, competitive construction plans provoked the 1877\u20131880 war over right of way with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Both rivals hired gunslingers and bought politicians while courts intervened to bring settlement to the disagreements. One anecdote of the conflict recounts June, 1879, when the Santa Fe defended its roundhouse in Pueblo with Dodge City toughs led by Bat Masterson; on that occasion, D&amp;RG treasurer R. F. Weitbrec paid the defenders to leave. In March, 1880, a Boston Court granted the AT&amp;SF the rights to Raton Pass, while the D&amp;RG paid an exorbitant $1.4million for the trackage extending through the Arkansas River's Royal Gorge. The D&amp;RG's possession of this route allowed quick access to the booming mining district of Leadville, Colorado. While this \"Treaty of Boston\" did not exactly favor the purest of original D&amp;RG intentions, the conquering of new mining settlements to the west and the future opportunity to expand into Utah was realized from this settlement.\nBy late 1880, William Bell had begun to organize railway construction in Utah that would become the Palmer controlled Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railway in mid-1881. The intention of the D&amp;RGW (aka the \"Western\") was to work eastward from Provo to an eventual link with westward bound D&amp;RG in Colorado. This physical connection was realized near the Green River on March30, 1883, and by May of that year the D&amp;RG formally leased its Utah subsidiary as previously planned. By mid-1883, financial difficulties due to aggressive growth and expenditures led to a shake up among the D&amp;RG board of directors, and General Palmer resigned as president of the D&amp;RG in August, 1883, while retaining that position with the Western. Frederick Lovejoy would soon fill Palmer's vacated seat on the D&amp;RG, the first in a succession of post Palmer presidents that would attempt to direct the railroad through future struggles and successes.\nFollowing bitter conflict with the Rio Grande Western during lease disagreements and continued financial struggles, the D&amp;RG went into receivership in July, 1884, with court-appointed receiver William S. Jackson in control. Eventual foreclosure and sale of the original Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railway resulted within two years, and the new Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad took formal control of the property and holdings on July14, 1886, with Jackson appointed as president. General Palmer would continue as president of the Utah line until retirement (due to company re-organization) in 1901.\nThroughout the railroad's history its primary heavy repair shops were located south of Denver, Colorado, in Burnham. They were built in 1871 and equipped to service both narrow gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. In 1922 the site received $3 million in upgrades, expanding the capacity to repair locomotives and cars. The last steam locomotive was serviced in 1956, at which time the locomotive department was converted to service diesel engines. The other major back shop site was in Salt Lake City, Utah, built in 1883. The shops in Alamosa, Colorado, primarily serviced narrow gauge rolling stock.\nRoyal Gorge Route.\nThe D&amp;RG built west from Pueblo reaching Ca\u00f1on City in 1874. The line through the Royal Gorge reached Salida on May 20, 1880, and was pushed to Leadville later that same year. From Salida, the D&amp;RG pushed west over the Continental Divide at the Marshall Pass and reached Gunnison on August 6, 1881. From Gunnison the line entered the Black Canyon of the Gunnison River passing the famous Curecanti Needle seen in their famous \"Scenic Line of the World\" Herald. The tracks left the increasingly-difficult canyon at Cimmaron and passed over Cerro Summit, reaching Montrose on September 8, 1882. From Montrose, a line was laid north through Delta, reaching Grand Junction in March, 1883. The line continued building west until reaching the D&amp;RGW close to present day Green River which completed a narrow-gauge transcontinental link with the Rio Grande Western Railway to Salt Lake City, Utah.\nThe line from Pueblo to Leadville was upgraded in 1887 to three rails to accommodate both narrow-gauge and standard-gauge operation. Narrow-gauge branch lines were constructed to Chama, New Mexico, Durango, Silverton, Crested Butte, Lake City, Ouray and Somerset, Colorado.\nThe D&amp;RG round herald featuring the words \"Royal Gorge Route\" was applied to rolling stock beginning in 1926 (A similar herald had been used on company stationery earlier). In 1936, the words \"Moffat Tunnel\" were added, and in 1939, it was replaced by the \"Flying Rio Grande\" logo.\nThe route over Tennessee Pass had steep grades, and it was not uncommon to see trains running with midtrain and rear-end helpers. In 1997, a year after the D&amp;RGW/SP merger with Union Pacific, the UP closed the line. Although it has been out of service for more than two decades, the rails are still in usable condition, though many of the signals have been ravaged by time and vandals. In 2011, under a federal Beautification Grant, a private contractor removed and scrapped the railroad's overhead signal pole lines.\nSan Juan Extension.\nThe D&amp;RG also pushed west from Walsenburg, Colorado, over La Veta Pass (now \"Old La Veta Pass\") by 1877. At the time the 'Uptop' depot on Veta Pass, rising over in elevation, boasted the highest elevation for a narrow-gauge railroad. The railroad reached Alamosa by 1878. From Alamosa, a line was pushed south through Antonito eventually reaching Santa Fe, New Mexico (the Chili Line), and west as far as Creede, Colorado. A line containing one of the longest narrow-gauge tangent tracks in U.S. railroading () also linked Alamosa with Salida to the north. From Antonito a line was built over Cumbres Pass, along the Colorado-New Mexico border, reaching Durango, Colorado, in August, 1881 and continuing north to the rich mining areas around Silverton in July, 1882. A line was also constructed in 1902 as a standard-gauge line, perhaps in anticipation of possible standard gauging of the entire line, south from Durango to Farmington, New Mexico.\nPart of the reason for this isolated change of gauge was that the Southern Pacific contemplated extending to access coal fields in the northern San Juan basin, had surveyors working there, and had incorporated a subsidiary, the \"Arizona &amp; Colorado Railroad Company\", for this purpose. As a defensive move, this may have been enough to discourage the A&amp;C from proceeding to construction. Originally hauling mainly agricultural products, the Farmington line was converted to narrow gauge in 1923, and later delivered pipe and other construction materials to the local oil and natural gas industry into the 1960s.\nPortions of the Alamosa\u2013Durango line survive to this day. The Walsenburg\u2013Alamosa\u2013Antonito line survives as the standard-gauge Colorado Pacific Rio Grande Railroad, with passenger excursion trains service provided by the Rio Grande Scenic Railroad. Two narrow-gauge segments survive as steam railroads, the Antonito\u2013Chama line as the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad and Durango\u2013Silverton as the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad.\nRio Grande Southern Railroad connected to San Juan Extension in Durango and went through the western edge of San Juan Mountains to Ridgway, Colorado, on Montrose\u2013Ouray branch.\nTennessee Pass.\nThe D&amp;RG built west from Leadville over Tennessee Pass in an attempt to reach the mining areas around Aspen, Colorado, before its rival railroad in the area, the Colorado Midland, could build a line reaching there. The D&amp;RG built a line through Glenwood Canyon to Glenwood Springs, reaching Aspen in October, 1887. The D&amp;RG then joined with the Colorado Midland to build a line from Glenwood Springs connecting with D&amp;RG at Grand Junction. Originally considered a secondary branch route to Grand Junction, the entire route from Leadville to Grand Junction was upgraded to standard gauge in 1890, and the original narrow-gauge route via Marshall Pass became a secondary route.\nDenver &amp; Rio Grande Western.\nThe first (1881-1889) Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railway built a narrow-gauge line from Ogden, Utah, via Soldier Summit, Utah, to Grand Junction, Colorado. The railroad was reorganized as the Rio Grande Western Railway in 1889, as part of a finance plan to upgrade the line from narrow gauge to standard gauge, and built several branch lines in Utah to reach lucrative coal fields. It was the railway which Gustaf Nordenski\u00f6ld employed to haul boxcars of relics from the Mesa Verde, Colorado, cliff dwellings, in 1891, en route to the National Museum of Finland. In 1901, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande merged with the Rio Grande Western, consolidating in 1908. However, the railroad was weakened by speculators, who had used the Rio Grande's equity to finance Western Pacific Railroad construction. The United States Railroad Administration (USRA) took over the D&amp;RG during World War I. In 1918, the D&amp;RG fell into receivership after the bankruptcy of Western Pacific. The Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&amp;RGW or DRGW) was incorporated in 1920, and formally emerged as the new re-organization of the old Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad on July 31, 1921.\nMoffat Road.\nIn 1931, the D&amp;RGW acquired the Denver and Salt Lake Western Railroad, a paper railroad subsidiary of the Denver and Salt Lake Railroad (D&amp;SL) which had acquired the rights to build a connection between the two railroads. After years of negotiation, the D&amp;RGW gained trackage rights on the D&amp;SL from Denver to the new cutoff. In 1932, the D&amp;RGW began construction of the Dotsero Cutoff east of Glenwood Springs to near Bond on the Colorado River, at a location called Orestod (Dotsero spelled backward). Construction was completed in 1934, giving Denver a direct transcontinental link to the west. The D&amp;RGW slipped into bankruptcy again in 1935. Emerging in 1947, it merged with the D&amp;SL on March3, 1947, gaining control of the \"Moffat Road\" through the Moffat Tunnel and a branch line from Bond to Craig, Colorado.\n\"Fast Freights\" and the California Zephyr, 1950\u20131983.\nFinally free from financial problems, the D&amp;RGW now possessed a direct route from Denver to Salt Lake City (the detour south through Pueblo and Tennessee Pass was no longer required for direct service), but a problem still remained: for transcontinental service, the Union Pacific's more northerly line was far less mountainous (and, as a result, several hours faster). The D&amp;RGW's solution was its \"fast freight\" philosophy, which employed multiple diesel locomotives pulling short, frequent trains. This philosophy helps to explain why the D&amp;RGW, despite its proximity to one of the nation's most productive coal mining regions, retired coal-fueled steam locomotives as quickly as new, replacement diesels could be purchased. By 1956, the D&amp;RGW's standard-gauge steam locomotives had been retired and scrapped. The reason for this was that unlike steam locomotives, diesel locomotives could easily be combined, using the diesels' multiple unit capabilities, to equip each train with the optimum horsepower which was needed to meet the D&amp;RGW's aggressive schedule.\nThe D&amp;RGW's sense of its unique geographical challenge found expression in the form of the \"California Zephyr\", a passenger train which was jointly operated with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&amp;Q) from Chicago to Denver, the D&amp;RGW from Denver to Salt Lake City, and the Western Pacific Railroad from Salt Lake City to Oakland, California (with ferry and bus connections to San Francisco). Unable to compete with the Union Pacific's faster, less mountainous route and 39 3/4-hour schedules, the \"California Zephyr\" offered a more leisurely journey \u2013 a \"rail cruise\" \u2013 with ample vistas of the Rockies. Although the \"California Zephyr\" ran at full capacity and turned a modest profit from its 1949 inception through the late 1950s, by the mid-1960s the train was profitable only during the late spring, summer, and fall. In 1970, Western Pacific, claiming multimillion-dollar losses, dropped out. However, the D&amp;RGW refused to join the national Amtrak system, and continued to operate its share of the Zephyr equipment as the \"Rio Grande Zephyr\" between Denver and Salt Lake City. By 1983, however, citing continued losses in revenue, the D&amp;RGW decided to get out of the passenger business altogether and join Amtrak. With this move, Amtrak rerouted the \"San Francisco Zephyr\" to the Moffat Road line and rebranded it as the current incarnation of the \"California Zephyr\".\nEven as the D&amp;RGW exploited the best new standard-gauge technology to compete with other transcontinental carriers, the railroad continued to operate the surviving steam-powered narrow-gauge lines, including the famed narrow-gauge line between Durango and Silverton, Colorado. Most of the remaining narrow-gauge trackage was abandoned in the 1950s and 1960s. At the end of 1970, it operated of road on of track; that year it carried 7,733 ton-miles of revenue freight and 21 million passenger-miles.\nTwo of the most scenic routes survived in operation by the D&amp;RGW until they were sold to tourist railroad operators. The Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad assumed operation of the line between Antonito, Colorado, and Chama, New Mexico, in 1970. The last D&amp;RGW narrow-gauge line, from Durango to Silverton, was sold in 1981 to the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, exactly one hundred years after the line went into operation.\nConsolidation with Southern Pacific.\nIn 1988, Rio Grande Industries, the company that controlled the D&amp;RGW under the direction of Philip Anschutz, purchased the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SP). The D&amp;RGW used Southern Pacific's name with SP due to its name recognition among shippers. In time, the D&amp;RGW's fast freight philosophy gave way to SP's long-established practice of running long, slow trains. A contributing factor was the rising cost of diesel fuel, a trend that set in after the 1973 oil crisis, which gradually undermined the D&amp;RGW's fuel-consuming \"fast freight\" philosophy. By the early 1990s, the combined Rio Grande/Southern Pacific system had lost much of the competitive advantage that made it attractive to transcontinental shippers, and became largely dependent on hauling the high-quality coal produced in the mine fields of Colorado and Utah.\nD&amp;RGW locomotives retained their reporting marks and colors after the consolidation with the Southern Pacific and would do so until the Union Pacific merger. The one noticeable change was to Southern Pacific's \"Bloody Nose\" paint scheme. The serif font on the sides of the locomotives was replaced by the Rio Grande's \"speed lettering\", which was utilized on all SP locomotives built or repainted after the merger.\nMerger with Union Pacific.\nOn September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined D&amp;RGW/SP system with the parent company Southern Pacific Rail Corporation to the Union Pacific Corporation, partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway. As the Union Pacific absorbed the D&amp;RGW into its system, signs of the fabled mountain railroad's existence slowly faded. D&amp;RGW 5371, the only original D&amp;RGW locomotive in full Rio Grande paint on the Union Pacific, was retired by UP in December 2008. D&amp;RGW 5371 was donated to the Utah State Railroad Museum at Ogden's Union Station on August17, 2009, and resides in the Eccles Rail Center at the south end of the building. Many other Rio Grande locomotives used to run in service with Union Pacific but have been \"patch-renumbered\", with a patch applied over the locomotive's number and the number boards replaced, but most, if not all, have been repainted into Union Pacifics Armour Yellow since.\nIn 2006, Union Pacific unveiled UP 1989, an EMD SD70ACe painted in a stylized version of the D&amp;RGW color scheme. This unit is one of several SD70ACe locomotives in the Union Pacific heritage fleet has painted in stylized colors to help preserve the image of the railroads it has merged.\nPresidents.\nThe following people served as presidents (or the equivalent) of the D&amp;RGW and its predecessors.\nRolling stock.\nBy the beginning of 1948 the company owned 318 steam locomotives, 62 diesel locomotives, 179 passenger cars and 14,662 freight cars. In 1962, there were 22 steam locomotives, 257 diesel locomotives, 96 passenger cars and 12,386 freight cars.\nPassenger trains.\nThis is a partial list of D&amp;RGW passenger trains. Westbound trains had odd numbers, while eastbound trains had even numbers. Many of the trains were named and renamed as well as being re-numbered. There are over 180 names on a complete list of all the railroad's named trains.\nRemnants.\nThe Union Pacific acquired all D&amp;RG owned assets at the time of the merger. The UP operates the former D&amp;RGW main line as part of its Central Corridor. However, several branch lines and other assets have been sold, abandoned or re-purposed. These include several presently operating heritage railways that trace their origins to the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western.\nStill-active and rebuilt features.\nActive rail assets tracing their heritage to the D&amp;RGW that are not part of the Union Pacific network today include:\nMuseums.\nThe largest collection of surviving \"California Zephyr\" equipment can be found at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California, although this museum focuses on the Western Pacific Railroad, rather than the Rio Grande.\nMuseums that focus on the D&amp;RGW include:\nMuseums using former D&amp;RGW depots as buildings include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In some countries, a licence is also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts. In such countries, some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fees. Licence fees are effectively a hypothecated tax to fund public broadcasting.\nHistory.\nRadio broadcasters in the early 20th century needed to raise funds for their services. In some countries, this was achieved via advertising, while others adopted a compulsory subscription model with households that owned a radio set being required to purchase a licence. The United Kingdom was the first country to adopt compulsory public subscription with a licence, originally known as a wireless licence, used to fund the BBC. In most countries that introduced radio licensing, possession of a licence was simply an indication of having paid the fee.\nWith the arrival of television, some countries created separate television licences. Other countries increased radio licence fees to cover the additional cost of television broadcasting, changing the name from \"radio licence\" to \"TV licence\" or \"receiver licence\". Today, most countries fund public radio broadcasting from the same licence fee that is used for television, although a few still have separate radio licences. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Japan, have lower fees for households that only own monochrome television sets. In many countries, elderly and disabled consumers have a reduced or zero licence fee.\nFaced with licence fee evasion, some countries chose to fund public broadcasters directly from taxation or via methods such as a co-payment with electricity billing. In some countries, national public broadcasters carry advertising.\nIn 1989, the Council of Europe created the European Convention on Transfrontier Television. Among other things, this regulates advertising. The treaty came into force in 1993 when it had been ratified by seven countries, including five EU member states. As of 2010[ [update]], 34 countries have acceded to the treaty.\nTelevision licensing by country.\nUsage and costs of television licences vary greatly between countries. The Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago reports that two-thirds of countries in Europe and half of countries in Asia and Africa use television licences to fund public television. Television licensing is rare in the Americas, largely confined to British Overseas Territories. In some countries, radio channels and broadcasters' websites are also funded by a licence, giving access to radio and online services free of advertising.\nTelevision licences in Europe.\nAlbania.\nThe Albanian licence fee is 100 lek\u00eb per month, paid as part of the electricity bill. This makes up part of RTSH's funding: 58 per cent comes directly from the government through taxes with the remainder from commercials and the licence fee.\nAustria.\nUnder Austria's TV and Radio Licence Law (\"Fernseh- und H\u00f6rfunklizenzrecht\"), all operational broadcast reception equipment must be registered. Since 1998, the Geb\u00fchren Info Service (GIS) has been responsible for licence administration. GIS was renamed ORF-Beitragsservice (OBS) in 2024. It is a fully owned subsidiary of the Austrian public broadcaster, (ORF) and an agency of the Federal Ministry of Finance. GIS aims to inform people about licensing, using a four-channel communication strategy consisting of:\nIn 2007 the total licensing income was \u20ac682 million, 66 per cent of which was allocated to the ORF. The remaining 34 per cent was allocated to the federal government and local governments to fund cultural activities. GIS employs 191 people and has approximately 125 freelancers in the field service. 3.4 million Austrian households are registered with the GIS with 2.5 per cent evading the licence.\nThe television &amp; radio licence fee varies between states. As of 2022, Styria has the highest annual television licence cost, at \u20ac343.80, and Salzburg and Burgenland have the highest annual radio licence cost, at \u20ac94.92. Annual fees from July 2022 are:\nSince 2024, the broadcasting fee has been replaced by a household tax that every household pays. It is \u20ac15.30 per month. In the federal states of Burgenland, Carinthia, Styria and Tyrol, an additional state tax must be paid - this amounts to between \u20ac3.10 and \u20ac4.70 per month.\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe licence fee in Bosnia and Herzegovina is approximately \u20ac46 per year. The Bosnian War and associated collapse of infrastructure caused very high evasion rates. This has partly been resolved by collecting the licence fee as part of each household's monthly telephone bill. The licence fee is divided between three broadcasters:\nCroatia.\nThe licence fee in Croatia is regulated by the Croatian Radiotelevision Act, 2003. This law was written to ensure compliance with the European Convention on Transfrontier Television, which Croatia joined between 1999 and 2002. In addition to the licensing, the law regulates television advertising. Up to 9 per cent of air time on HRT may be given to advertising, with a limit of only one commercial during short breaks and no breaks during films. This is less than the limit permitted for commercial broadcasters.\nThe licence fee is charged to all owners of equipment capable of receiving television or radio broadcasts. It is set at 1.5 per cent of the previous year's average net salary, which is \u20ac137 per year per household with at least one radio or television receiver. It is the main source of revenue for the national broadcaster Hrvatska Radiotelevizija (HRT), and a secondary source of income for other national and local broadcasters, which receive a minority share. Within HRT, 66 per cent of the licence fee income goes to television and 34 per cent to radio.\nCzech Republic.\nThe licence fee in the Czech Republic is 150 K\u010d per month for television and 55 K\u010d per month for radio, amounting to 2460 K\u010d per year. Paid advertisements are not permitted on television except in narrowly defined circumstances during a transitional period. Each household that owns at least one television pays for one licence, regardless of how many televisions they own. Corporations and the self-employed must pay for a licence for each television and radio.\nGermany.\nThe licence fee in Germany is \u20ac18.36 per month (\u20ac220 per annum) for all apartments, secondary residences, holiday homes and summer houses. Since 2003 it has been payable regardless of possession or use of television and radio. Businesses and institutions must pay, based on factors including numbers of employees, vehicles and, for hotels, beds. The fee is billed monthly but typically paid quarterly or yearly. It is collected by Beitragsservice von ARD, ZDF und Deutschlandradio which is sometimes criticised for its enforcement measures. Since 2013, only recipients of certain social benefits such as Arbeitslosengeld II or student loans and grants are exempt from the licence fee. People with certain disabilities can apply to pay a reduced fee of \u20ac5.83. Low income, in general, is no longer a reason for exemption. Since the fee is billed to a person and not to a dwelling, empty dwellings are exempt.\nThe licence fee is used to fund the public broadcasters ZDF and Deutschlandradio, as well as the nine regional broadcasters of the ARD network. Together, they run 22 television channels (10 regional, 10 national, 2 international: Arte and 3sat) and 61 radio stations (58 regional, 3 national). Two national television stations and 32 regional radio stations carry limited advertising. The 14 regional regulatory authorities for private broadcasters are also funded by the licence fee, and in some states, non-profit community radio stations get small amounts of the licence fee. Germany's international broadcaster, Deutsche Welle, is fully funded by the German federal government, though much of its new content is provided by the ARD.\nGermany's per capita budget for public broadcasting is close to the European average but the total is one of the largest in the world. In 2006, annual income from licence fees was more than \u20ac7.9 billion.\nThe board of public broadcasters sued the German states for interference with their budgeting process, and on 11 September 2007, the Supreme Court decided in their favour. This effectively rendered the public broadcasters independent and self-governing.\nPublic broadcasters have announced that they are determined to use all available ways to reach their \"customers\" and as such have started a very broad Internet presence with media portals, news and TV programs. National broadcasters abandoned an earlier pledge to restrict their online activities. This resulted in newspapers taking court action against the ARD, claiming that its \"Tagessschau\" smartphone app was unfairly subsidised by the licence fee, to the detriment of free-market providers of news content apps. The case was dismissed with the court advising the two sides to find a compromise.\nGreece.\nThe licence fee in Greece is paid through electricity bills. It is charged to every electricity account, including private residences and businesses. There has been discussion of replacing it with a direct licence fee after complaints from people who do not own a television set. An often-quoted joke is that even the dead pay the licence fee, since graveyards have electricity bills.\nLicensing income is paid to the state broadcaster, Ellinik\u00ed Radiofon\u00eda Tile\u00f3rasi (ERT). In June 2013, ERT was closed down to save money for the Greek government and licence fees were temporarily suspended.\nIn June 2015, ERT reopened and the licence fee resumed at a rate of \u20ac36 per year.\nIreland.\nAs of 2020, the cost of a television licence in Ireland is \u20ac160 per year. The licence applies to premises so a separate licence is required for holiday homes or motor vehicles which contain a television. The licence must be paid for premises that have any equipment that can potentially decode TV signals, regardless of whether they view RT\u00c9's content. The licence is free to anyone over the age of 70, to some people over 66, to people on a disability allowance, and people who are blind (these licences are paid for by the state). The Irish post office, An Post, is responsible for the collection of the licence fee and commencement of prosecution proceedings in cases of non-payment, but An Post has signalled its intention to withdraw from its licence fee business. The licence fee makes up 50 per cent of the revenue of RT\u00c9, the national broadcaster with the rest coming from radio and television advertisements. Some RT\u00c9 services have not historically relied on the licence for income, such as RT\u00c9 2fm, RT\u00c9 Aertel, RT\u00c9.ie but since 2012 RT\u00c9 2FM has had some financial support from the licence. The RT\u00c9 Transmission Network operates on an entirely commercial basis.\nFive per cent of the licence fee goes to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's \"Sound and Vision Scheme\", which provides funds for programme production and restoration of archive material. From 2011 until 2018, five per cent of RT\u00c9's licence income was granted to TG4. RT\u00c9 is now required to provide TG4 with programming. The remainder of TG4's funding is from direct state grants and commercial income.\nItaly.\nThe licence fee in Italy is charged to each household with a television set, regardless of use, and to all public premises with one or more televisions or radios. In 2016, the government reduced the licence fee to \u20ac100 per household and incorporated it into electricity bills in an attempt to eliminate evasion, and as of 2018, the fee was \u20ac90.00.\nSixty-six per cent of RAI's income comes from the licence fee (up from about half of total income seven years ago), with another twenty-five per cent from advertising, which is aired pretty regularly every 20 minutes or so, with very few exceptions (football matches, special events, Eurovision Song Contest)\nMontenegro.\nUnder the Broadcasting Law of December 2002, each household and legal entity in Montenegro able to receive radio or television programmes is required to pay a broadcasting subscription fee. The monthly fee is \u20ac3.50, or \u20ac42.00 per annum. Funds are distributed, \nThe Broadcasting Agency of Montenegro collected the fee through telephone bills, but after the privatization of Telekom, the new owners, T-com, announced they would not administer the fee after July 2007.\nPoland.\nAs of 2023, the licence fee in Poland for a television set is 27.30 z\u0142 per month, or for radio only is 8.70 z\u0142 per month. One licence is required per household, irrespective of the number of sets. The fee is waived for people over 75. Public health institutions, nurseries, educational institutions, hospices and retirement homes need only one licence per building or building complex they occupy. Commercial premises need a licence for each set, including radios and televisions in company vehicles.\nAround 60 per cent of the fee goes to Telewizja Polska with the rest going to Polskie Radio. Advertisements are allowed between programmes on public television but it is not permitted to interrupt its programmes for advertisements.\nThe licence is collected and maintained by the Polish post office, Poczta Polska. There is a major problem with licence evasion in Poland: in 2012 around 65 per cent of households evaded the licence fee (compared to an average of 10 per cent in the European Union), and in 2020, only 8 per cent of Polish households paid the licence fee. Reasons for non-payment include the opt-in system in which there is no effective means to compel people to register or to prosecute those who fail to do so. Licensing inspectors, who are usually postal workers, do not have the right of entry to inspect premises and must get the owner's or occupier's permission to enter. Also, the public media are frequently accused of producing pro-government propaganda and not being independent public broadcasters. Due to widespread non-payment of the licence fee, in 2020 the government gave a 2\u00a0billion z\u0142oty grant for public media.\nPortugal.\nFrom September 2003, the R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal (RTP) was financed through government grants and the \"Taxa de Contribui\u00e7\u00e3o Audiovisual\" (Portuguese for \"Broadcasting Contribution Tax\"), charged monthly through the electricity bills.\nFollowing the 2010\u20132014 Portuguese financial crisis, government grants ended and RTP was financed only through the \"Taxa de Contribui\u00e7\u00e3o Audiovisual\" and advertising. Since July 2016, the fee is \u20ac2.85 + VAT per month.\nRTP1 can broadcast only 6 minutes of commercial advertising per hour (commercial channels can broadcast 12 minutes per hour). RTP2 and the public radios stations have no commercial advertising. RTP3 and RTP Mem\u00f3ria can broadcast commercial advertising on cable, satellite and IPTV platforms but not on digital terrestrial television.\nSerbia.\nLicence fees in Serbia are bundled together with electricity bills and collected monthly. Current fee is 349 RSD (the newest price, as of August 2024), which is about \u20ac3.\nSlovenia.\nSince June 2013, the annual licence fee in Slovenia is \u20ac12.75 per household per month to receive both television and radio services, or \u20ac3.77 per month for radio only, regardless of the number of devices capable of receiving television or radio broadcasts. Businesses and the self-employed pay this amount for each set and pay higher rates where they are intended for public viewing rather than private use by employees.\nThe licence fee is used to fund the national broadcaster RTV Slovenija. In 2007, the licence fee raised \u20ac78.1\u00a0million, approximately 68 per cent of the broadcaster's operating revenue. RTV Slovenija's advertising income in 2007 was \u20ac21.6\u00a0million.\nSwitzerland.\nAny household that receives radio or television programs from the Swiss national public broadcaster SRG SSR must be registered and pay licence fees. The fee is CHF 335 per year for TV and radio for single households, and CHF 670 for multiple households, e.g. nursing homes. Households unable to receive broadcast transmissions are exempt from the fees until 2023 if residents apply to opt out. Residential licence fees are collected by Serafe AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance collections agency Secon. Non-payment of licence fees incurs fines of up to CHF 100,000. For businesses, the fee is on a scale based on the company's annual turnover and is collected by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.\nThe majority of the fee, CHF 1.2\u00a0billion, goes to SRG SSR, with the rest going to a collection of small regional radio and television broadcasters.\nOn 4 March 2018, there was a referendum on whether TV licensing should be scrapped, with the slogan \"No Billag\", a reference to the previous collector of the licence fees. Parliament have advocated a no vote. Voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposal by 71.6 to 28.4 per cent and in all cantons. Following the vote, the fee was significantly reduced.\nTurkey.\nA licence fee of up to 16 per cent is paid to the state broadcaster TRT by the producer or importer of the equipment that can receive TRT's broadcasts or on-demand content in any manner including internet. Consumers indirectly pay this fee when purchasing equipment. No registration is required for television receiving equipment, except for cellular phones as mandated by a separate law.\nTRT also receives funding via advertisements. Previously a 2 per cent tax was added to monthly electricity bills but this has been abolished.\nUnited Kingdom.\nA television licence is required for each household where television programmes are watched or recorded as they are broadcast, irrespective of the signal method (terrestrial, satellite, cable or the Internet). As of September 2016, users of BBC iPlayer must also have a television licence to watch on-demand television content from the service. As of 1 April 2017, after a price freeze that began in 2010, the cost of a licence may now increase to account for inflation. As of April 2025, the licence fee is \u00a3174.50 for a colour and \u00a358.50 for a black and white television Licence As it is classified in law as a tax, evasion of licence fees is a criminal offence. 204,018 people were prosecuted or fined in 2014 for TV licence offences: 173,044 in England, 12,536 in Wales, 4,905 people in Northern Ireland and 15 in the Isle of Man.\nThe licence fee is used almost entirely to fund BBC domestic radio, television and internet services. Money received from the licence represents approximately 75 per cent of the cost of these services, with most of the remainder coming from the profits of BBC Studios, a commercial arm of the corporation which distributes content outside of the United Kingdom, and operates or licences BBC-branded television services and brands. The BBC also receives some funding from the Scottish Government via MG Alba to finance the BBC Alba Gaelic-language television service in Scotland. The BBC used to receive a direct government grant from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to fund television and radio services broadcast to other countries, such as the BBC World Service radio and BBC Arabic Television. These services run on a non-profit, non-commercial basis. The grant was abolished on 1 April 2014, leaving these services to be funded by the UK licence fee, a move which has caused some controversy.\nChannel 4 is also a public television service but it is funded through advertising. The Welsh language S4C is funded through a combination of a direct grant from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and advertising, and receives some programming free of charge from the BBC. These other broadcasters are much smaller than the BBC.\nIn addition to public broadcasters, the United Kingdom has a wide range of commercial television funded by advertising and subscription. A television licence is still required of viewers who solely watch such commercial channels, although 74.9 per cent of the population watches BBC One in any given week, making it the most popular channel in the country. A similar licence existed for radio but was abolished in 1971.\nTelevision licences in Africa.\nGhana.\nThe licence fee in Ghana was reintroduced in 2015, and is used to fund the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC). Households have to pay between GH\u00a236 and GH\u00a260 per year for using one or more televisions at home.\nMauritius.\nThe licence fee in Mauritius is Rs 1,800 per year (around \u20ac29), collected as part of the electricity bill. The fee provides 60 per cent of the income for Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation (MBC). Most of the remaining funds come from television and radio commercials. The introduction of private broadcasting in 2002 has put pressure on MBC's commercial revenues. Private stations argue that MBC affects their profitability and they want the government to make MBC commercial-free.\nNamibia.\nThe licence fee in Namibia was N$204 (about \u20ac23) in 2001. The fee is used to fund the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation.\nSouth Africa.\nThe licence fee in South Africa is R265 (about \u20ac23) per annum (R312 per year if paid on a monthly basis) for television. A concessionary rate of R70 is available for those over 70, disabled persons and war veterans who are on social welfare. The licence fee partially funds the public broadcaster, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), providing R972\u00a0million (almost \u20ac90 million) in 2008\u20139. SABC derives much of its income from advertising. Proposals to abolish licensing have circulated since October 2009. The national carrier hopes to receive funding entirely from state subsidies and commercials.\nTelevision licences in Asia.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, the annual licence fee (, \"jushin-ryo\") for terrestrial television broadcasts is \u00a514,205 (about \u20ac88.34), and \u00a524,740 (about \u20ac153.85) for those receiving satellite broadcasts. The fee is slightly less if paid by direct debit. There is a separate licence for monochrome TV, and fees are slightly less in Okinawa.\nThe Japanese licence fee pays for the national broadcaster, Nippon H\u014ds\u014d Ky\u014dkai (NHK).\nEvery household in Japan with a television set is required to have a licence, but in 2006 non-payment was described as \"epidemic\" following a series of scandals involving NHK. In 2005, it was reported that \"there is no fine or any other form of sanction for non-payment\". The NHK Party, often called the Anti-NHK Party, was founded in 2013 as a single-issue political party to oppose the licence fee, with its only policy being to encrypt NHK's broadcast signal, meaning only those who watch NHK pay for it.\nPakistan.\nThe television licence in Pakistan is Rs 420 (about \u20ac1.45) per year, collected as a monthly charge on all electricity bills. The fee plus advertising revenue fund the Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV).\nSouth Korea.\nIn South Korea, the television licence fee () is collected for the Korean Broadcasting System and the Educational Broadcasting System. The fee is \u20a930,000 per year (about \u20ac20.67), and is bundled with electricity bills. It has stood at this level since 1981, and now makes up less than 40 per cent of KBS's income and less than 8 per cent of EBS's income. Its purpose is to maintain public broadcasting in South Korea, and give public broadcasters the resources to do their best to produce and broadcast public interest programs.\nCountries where the TV licence has been abolished.\nThe following countries have had television licences, but subsequently abolished them:\nAustralia.\nRadio licence fees were introduced in Australia in the 1920s to fund privately owned broadcasters, which were not permitted to sell advertising. With the formation of the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1932, licence fees were used to fund ABC broadcasts while privately owned stations were permitted to seek revenue from advertising and sponsorship. Television licence fees were introduced in 1956 when the ABC began television transmissions. In 1964 a television licence, issued on a punched card, cost \u00a36 (A$12); the fine for not having a licence was \u00a3100 (A$200).\nAll licence fees were abolished on 18 September 1974 by the Whitlam government on the grounds that the near-universality of television and radio use meant that public funding was fairer. Since then, the ABC has been funded by government grants, now totalling around A$1.13\u00a0billion per year, plus its own commercial activities (merchandising, overseas sale of programmes, etc.).\nBelgium.\nFlemish region and Brussels.\nThe Flemish region of Belgium and Brussels abolished its television licence in 2001. The Flemish broadcaster VRT is now funded from general taxation.\nWalloon region.\nFrom 1 January 2018, the licence fee in the Walloon region (encompassing the French and German-speaking communities) was abolished. Licences in effect at that remained payable until their period was up but were not renewed after that period.\nThe licence fee in Belgium's Walloon region was \u20ac100.00 for a television and \u20ac0.00 for a radio in a vehicle. One licence was needed per household with a functional television receiver, regardless of the number, but each car with a radio had to have a separate car radio licence. Household radios did not require a licence. The money raised by the fee was used to fund Belgium's French and German public broadcasters (RTBF and BRF respectively). The television licence fee was paid by people with surnames beginning with a letter between A and J between 1 April and 31 May inclusive, and those with surnames beginning with a letter between K and Z paid between 1 October and 30 November inclusive. People with certain disabilities were exempt from paying the fee. Hotels and similar lodging establishments paid an additional fee of \u20ac50.00 for each additional functional TV receiver and paid between 1 January and 1 March inclusive.\nBulgaria.\nA fee for use of television and radio was included the fee in the Bulgarian Radio and Television Law passed in the 1990s. Following public criticism, the president vetoed the law. The Bulgarian National Assembly retained the power to impose a fee but added a temporary measure funding Bulgarian National Television (BNT) and Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) directly from the national budget. This funding mechanism has been retained since then.\nCanada.\nThe Radiotelegraph Act 1913 required anyone possessing a radio receiver to hold an \"Amateur Experimental Station\" licence, and pass an \"Amateur Experimental Certificate of Proficiency\", demonstrating the ability to send and receive Morse code at five words per minute. In January 1922 the government introduced a Private Receiving Station licence for people who only intended to receive radio, rather than transmit. The receiving station licences initially cost $1 per year. Over time this increased to $2.50 to cover radio and television broadcasts by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). The licence fee was abolished in 1953 and replaced with a 15% excise tax on television equipment (including sets, picture tubes, and parts) to fund the CBC. This excise tax was phased out in 1958, with the CBC's funding shifting primarily to parliamentary appropriations.\nCyprus.\nCyprus had an indirect tax for CyBC, its state-run public broadcasting service, paid through electricity bills dependent on home size. It was abolished in the late 1990s and CyBC is now funded by advertising and government grants.\nDenmark.\nUntil 2022 a Danish media licence fee of 1353 kr (\u20ac182) per year was charged for any devices that could receive broadcast television. The majority of the licence fee funded the national radio and television broadcaster DR, with a smaller proportion funding TV 2's regional services. The media licence was abolished in 2022. Funding for DR is now provided through general taxation. TV 2 is now funded through advertising revenue, and it receives indirect subsidies through favourable loans from the Danish state.\nFinland.\nThe television fee in Finland was between \u20ac244.90 and \u20ac253.80 per year for each household with a television. It was the primary source of funding for Yleisradio (Yle). In 2013 it was replaced with the Yle public broadcasting tax (, ), a progressive income tax up to \u20ac163 per person. People with low incomes and under the age of eighteen years are exempt from the tax. Residents of \u00c5land did not have to pay the tax until 2020, but have been paying a media tax since 2021, which is currently (2024) at 123 euros per year.\nFrance.\nUntil 2022 a broadcasting licence fee () funded Radio France and France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions. People under the age of 21, under 25 and in full-time education, and those who had a household income below a certain threshold were exempt from the fee. The fee was abolished in 2022 and replaced with direct funding from the French Treasury.\nGibraltar.\nUntil 2006 television licence fees provided funds to the Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation (GBC). The licence fee was scrapped due to the low amount of fees. Even before the abolition of the licence fee, the majority of GBC's funding came as a grant from the government.\nHungary.\nIn Hungary, licence fees nominally exist, but since 2002 residential fees have been paid from the state budget. This means that funding for Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3 and Duna TV comes directly from taxation. Commercial venues such as hotels and bars also had their fees paid between 2002 and 2007, but since then they have needed to make a payment per television set.\nEver since privatisation in 1995, the public broadcaster MTV has had persistent financial difficulties. During the 2009 financial crisis, parliament cut their funding by more than 30 per cent, a move that was publicly condemned by the EBU.\nHong Kong.\nHong Kong previously had a radio and television licence fee for Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) and Rediffusion Television, costing 36 Hong Kong dollars per year. RTHK is now funded by the Hong Kong Government.\nIceland.\nThe television licence fee for Iceland's state broadcaster R\u00daV was abolished in 2007 and replaced with a poll tax of 17,200 kr. from everyone who pays income tax, regardless of whether they use television and radio.\nIndia.\nIndia introduced a radio receiver licence system in 1928 for All India Radio (AIR) Akashvani. Television licensing began in 1956\u201357. In 1976, public television was separated from AIR as a separate company, Doordarshan. In the 1970s and 1980s, radio licences cost INR 15 per year and television licences cost INR 50. The wireless licence inspector from the post office was authorised to check every house and shop for a Wireless Licence Book, and to issue penalties or seize the receiving equipment for non-payment. In 1984, the licensing system was withdrawn. AIR and Doordarshan are both funded by the Government of India and by income from advertising.\nIndonesia.\nA radio tax for RRI funding was introduced in 1947, during the Indonesian National Revolution. The television fee was introduced soon after TVRI started broadcasting in 1962. The radio tax was abolished in the 1980s. The television fee continued into the 1990s. Its abolition started after public protests about the company that collected the fee, which was run by the Indonesian President's son, but areas such as Bandung and Surabaya continued to have a television fee throughout the 1990s. A \"broadcasting fee\" () was included in legislation in 2002 but has not been implemented. Public radio and television are currently funded through a combination of advertising and funds from the state budget.\nIsrael.\nLicence fees were the primary source of revenue for the Israel Broadcasting Authority when it was the state broadcaster. Every household was charged \u20aa 345 (\u20ac73) for a television licence and car owners were charged \u20aa 136 (\u20ac29) for a radio licence. The television licence was abolished in 2015, but a radio licence is still required of car owners. Since the 1980s, the television programs of the Israeli Broadcasting Authority were sponsored by commercial entities, and the airing of Public service announcements in a pseudo-commercial format became widespread. Both of these practices, while forbidden by the BBC model of television licence, were also found in continental European public broadcasters, albeit in a smaller scope than under the IBA. Their use in Israel caused a widespread public sentiment that the licence fee failed in its goal of ensuring that public broadcasting is free of commercial interests.\nThe Israel Broadcasting Authority was replaced by the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation in May 2017. Its radio stations carry advertising and some of its television programmes are sponsored by commercial entities.\nLiechtenstein.\nAn annual licence was required between 1978 and 1998 for households with broadcast receiving equipment. The income was divided between PTT and the Swiss national broadcaster, SRG. Since 1998, an annual government grant for public media is administrated by the Mediakommision.\nThe sole radio station in the principality, Radio Liechtenstein, was founded as a private commercial music station in 1995. It was nationalised in 2004 under Liechtensteinischer Rundfunk to create a domestic public broadcasting station. It is funded by commercials and the public broadcasting grant.\nMalaysia.\nThe annual television licence fee for television in 1990 was at RM 24, previously RM 36 in 1986 and RM 12 in 1985, while the radio licence fee in 1990 was at RM 12; unchanged since the 1960s. The licence fee for the former was also the lowest in the world as of 1989. The licence fee for monochrome televisions in 1985 was at RM 24.\nLicences for home-use radios were abolished by late 1985 with the amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1960, while radio licences were abolished on 1 January 1991, due to Malaysia's improved economic performance.\n46.5% of television owners did not pay for the television licence in 1995.\nIn 1995, the government had planned to introduce pre-payment of television licence fees for people who have purchased a new television once every ten years, amounting RM 240 for each, replacing the annual payment which caused the government to lose millions of ringgit every year.\nThe government planned to add a separate licence for cable and satellite television owners and an increase of television licence fee for such users in 1996; it also had planned to increase the television licence fee to RM 36 in 1998.\nThe television licence fees were abolished in April 1999; however people still paid for the fees. The government decided to refund the fees that amounted to RM 67 million, becoming just RM 21 million in 2000.\nUntil April 2000, Malaysia had an annual television licence fee of MYR 24 (MYR 2 per month), one of the lowest television licence fees in the world. Now, RTM is funded by the government and advertising.\nMalta.\nThe licence fee in Malta funded Television Malta (TVM), and the radio stations Radio Malta and Radju Parliament run by Public Broadcasting Services. Approximately two-thirds of TVM's funding came from the licence fee, with much of the remainder coming from commercials. Malta's television licence was abolished in 2011 when the free-to-air system was introduced.\nNetherlands.\nAdvertising on public television and radio started in 1967 but was tightly regulated. Initially there was only a small advertising segment before and after news broadcasts. In the late 1980s, commercial breaks of 1 to 3 minutes were allowed between programmes. Advertising on Sundays was not permitted until 1991.\nDue to excessive collection costs, the fee was abolished around 2000. Income tax was increased and the maximum duration of commercial breaks was extended to 5 and 7\u00a0minutes. The Netherlands Public Broadcasting is now funded by government subsidy and advertising. The amount of time used by commercial breaks may not exceed 15 per cent of daily broadcasting time or 10 per cent of total annual broadcasting time.\nNew Zealand.\nLicence fees were first used in New Zealand to fund the radio services of what was to become the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation. Television was introduced in 1960 and with it the television licence fee, later known as the public broadcasting fee. This was capped at NZ$100 a year in the 1970s, and the country's two television channels, while still publicly owned, became increasingly reliant on advertising. From 1989, it was collected and disbursed by the Broadcasting Commission (NZ On Air) on a contestable basis to support local content production. The public broadcasting fee was abolished in July 1999. NZ On Air was then funded by a direct appropriation from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.\nNorth Macedonia.\nThe licence fee in the Republic of North Macedonia was around \u20ac26 per year. Until 2005 it was collected monthly as part of the electricity bill. From November 2005, Macedonian Radio-Television (MRT) collected the fee until this responsibility was taken over by the Public Revenue Office. The fee was paid per household, with exemptions for households not covered by a broadcasting signal, and households of people with severe vision or hearing impairment. Hotels and motels were charged one broadcasting fee for every five rooms, legal persons and office space owners paid for one broadcasting fee for each 20 employees or other users of the office space, and owners of catering and other public facilities paid per television set. MRT also received income from advertising and sponsorship.\nIn January 2017, the licence fee was abolished. MRT, Macedonian Broadcasting and the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services are now financed directly from the Budget of the Republic of North Macedonia.\nNorway.\nThe licence fee in Norway was abolished in January 2020. Before that, every household with a television needed to pay a fee of c. 3000 kr (c. \u20ac305). The fee was charged per household. People in a house who had a separate television and were not in the parental care of the householders needed to pay a separate licence fee. \nThe fee was the primary source of income for Norsk Rikskringkasting (NRK). Since 2020, funding for NRK comes through taxation from each individual liable for income taxes in Norway.\nRomania.\nUntil 2017 a licence fee was collected as part of the electricity bill. It made up part of Televiziunea Rom\u00e2n\u0103's (TVR) funding, with the rest coming from advertising and government grants. Everyone with a television receiver or a computer needed to pay.\nIn 2016, the Parliament of Romania decided to abolish the fee from 1 January 2017. Since then, TVR's funding mainly comes from government grants and advertising.\nSingapore.\nResidents of Singapore with televisions in their households, or televisions or radios in their vehicles, were required to acquire the appropriate licences from 1963 to 2010. The licence fee in 1963 was at $24 per year ($2 per month), touted at the time as being \"one of the cheapest in this part of the world\". The licence fees are channelled to the Singapore Broadcasting Authority where they would be used to fund minority and public service programmes.\nAs of 1991, the licence fee was at $100 per year.\nThe licence fees were abolished from 1 January 2011. Then Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam reported that he was abolishing the fees as they were \"losing their relevance\".\nSlovakia.\nThe TV licence fee in Slovakia was \u20ac4.64 per month (\u20ac55.68 per year). In addition to the licence fee, RTVS also received state subsidies and money from advertising. The licence fee was abolished from 1 July 2023.\nSoviet Union.\nUntil 1961, all radio and television receivers in the Soviet Union were required to be registered in local telecommunication offices and a subscription fee was to be paid monthly. Compulsory registration and subscription fees were abolished on 18 August 1961, with prices of radio and television receivers raised to compensate for the lost fees.\nSweden.\nOn 1 January 2019, the television licence (, literally \"TV fee\") in Sweden was scrapped and replaced by a \"general public service fee\" (), which is a flat income-based public broadcasting tax of 1 per cent, capped at (approximately or ) per person per year. The fee is administered by the Swedish Tax Agency (), on behalf of the country's three public broadcasters Sveriges Television (SVT), Sveriges Radio (SR) and Sveriges Utbildningsradio (UR). The fee pays for 5 television channels, 45 radio channels, and online television and radio.\nPreviously the television licence was a household-based flat fee. Originally it was referred as the \"television licence\" (), but in the 2000s was renamed \"television fee\". It was last charged in 2018 at per annum. It was payable in monthly, bimonthly, quarterly or annual instalments, to the agency Radiotj\u00e4nst i Kiruna, which was jointly owned by SVT, SR and UR. The fee was collected by every household or company containing a television set, and possession of such a device had to be reported to Radiotj\u00e4nst by law. One fee was collected per household regardless of the number of television sets in the home or at other locations owned by the household, such as summer houses. Although the fee also paid for radio broadcasting, there was no specific fee for radios since the radio licence was abolished in 1978. Television licence evasion was suspected to be around 11 to 15 per cent.\nTaiwan.\nBetween 1959 and the 1970s, all radio and TV receivers in Taiwan were required to have a licence with an annual fee of NT$60. This was to prevent influence from mainland China's (the People's Republic of China) channels.\nThailand.\nThe Radio Broadcasting and Television Act, B.E. 2498 (1955) set a lifetime licence fee of 200 baht (equivalent to baht in 2020) for ownership of radio and television sets or parts. It was abolished in 1959 as television and radio quickly became a vital source of information.\nCountries that have never had a television or broadcasting licence.\nAndorra.\nR\u00e0dio i Televisi\u00f3 d'Andorra, the public broadcaster, is funded by advertising and government grants with no fee for viewers.\nBrazil.\nThe federal company Empresa Brasil de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, which manages TV Brasil and public radio stations (R\u00e1dio MEC and R\u00e1dio Nacional), is financed from the Federal Budget, besides profit from licensing and production of programs, institutional advertisement, and service rendering to public and private institutions.\nThe Padre Anchieta Foundation, which manages TV Cultura and the Cultura FM and Cultura Brasil radio stations in S\u00e3o Paulo, receives funds from the state government, advertisements and fundraising from the private sector. In December 1997, the \"Education and Culture Tax\", a state tax in S\u00e3o Paulo, was instituted to fund the state's public broadcasters, TV Cultura and R\u00e1dio Cultura. The tax was charged monthly through electricity bills according to consumers' energy consumption. However, the collection of the fee was declared unconstitutional by the Court of Justice of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo.\nChile.\nThe state-owned Chilean television broadcaster, Televisi\u00f3n Nacional de Chile (TVN), founded in 1969, is financed by advertising, which can air between programs. Its autonomous financing allows the corporation to have economic independence from the State of Chile, being able to fully retain and take advantage of its annual profits only if the director in charge can esteem that way, as if it were a private company; however, TVN by a 1992 law cannot receive state financing under any circumstance. Its educational subchannel, NTV, is instead state-financed through a unique provision of funds courtesy of the Finance Ministry of Chile, and therefore cannot air advertisements, as well as have any commercial links.\nChina.\nThe current state broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV), established in 1958, is funded almost entirely through the sale of commercial advertising time, although this is supplemented by government funding and a tax of \u00a52 per month from all cable television subscribers in the country.\nEstonia.\nIn Estonia there are three public TV channels: Eesti Televisioon ETV, ETV2, and ETV+ (ETV+ was launched on 27 September 2015 and mostly targets people who speak Russian). The funding comes from government grant-in-aid. ETV is currently one of only a few public television broadcasters in the European Union which has neither advertising nor a licence fee and is solely funded by national government grants. Commercials in public broadcasting television were stopped in 2002 over concerns that its low prices were damaging the ability of commercial broadcasters to operate. The introduction of a licence fee system was considered but ultimately rejected in the face of public opposition.\nIran.\nIran has never levied television licence fees. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, National Iranian Radio and Television was renamed Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, and became the state broadcaster. In Iran, private broadcasting is illegal.\nLatvia.\nPublic Broadcasting of Latvia is a consortium of the public radio broadcaster Latvijas Radio and the public TV broadcaster Latvijas Telev\u012bzija, which operates the LTV1 and LTV7 channels. After years of debate, the public broadcasters ceased airing commercial advertising from January 1, 2021, and became fully government-funded by the national budget. The introduction of a television licence has been previously debated, but this was opposed by the government.\nLuxembourg.\nLuxembourg has never had a television licence requirement, which made it a prime way for various multi-national stations to host their operations and transmitters in the country, which was the fate of Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Luxembourg. Until 1993, it had no national public broadcaster, and it still has no public television broadcaster.\nRadio 100,7 is a radio station funded by the country's Ministry of Culture and by sponsorship arrangements. Television in Luxembourg is provided by the commercial network RTL T\u00e9l\u00e9 L\u00ebtzebuerg and channels serving nearby countries.\nMonaco.\nMonaco has never had any listener or viewer broadcasting licence fee. Since the establishment of Radio Monte-Carlo in 1943 and T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Monte-Carlo in 1954, both have been funded on a commercial basis with no charge for the audience.\nNigeria.\nTelevision licences are not used in Nigeria, except in the sense of \"broadcasting licences\" granted to private networks. The federal government's television station, NTA (Nigerian Television Authority), has two broadcast networks: NTA 1 is partly funded by central government and partly by advertising revenue, and NTA 2 is wholly funded by advertisements. Almost all thirty-six states have their own television stations, funded wholly or substantially by their respective governments.\nPhilippines.\nTelevision licensing has never been enacted in the Philippines. The state-owned television (PTV and IBC) and radio (PBS) stations have been funded directly by the government's annual budget and by advertising.\nPost-Soviet states.\nSee #Soviet Union.\nSpain.\nSpanish national public broadcasters had been funded by government grants and advertising income since (RNE) radio service was launched in 1937 and (TVE) television service was launched in 1956. Although RNE removed advertising in 1986, TVE continued broadcasting commercials until 2009. Since 2010, Radiotelevisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola (RTVE) \u2013the corporation that absorbed the management of RNE and TVE in 2007\u2013 is funded by government grants and taxes paid by private nationwide television broadcasters and telecommunications companies.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, privately owned commercial radio and television stations funded by advertising proved to be commercially viable. Some governments owned non-commercial radio stations (such as WNYC, owned by New York City from 1922 to 1997) or educational television stations, but most broadcasters were private companies or were owned by charitable organizations supported by donations.\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was created by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, and this led to the creation of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR). These are loose networks of non-commercial educational (NCE) stations owned by state and local governments, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations. They are more similar to U.S. commercial networks than European public broadcasters.\nAnnual funding for public television in the United States was US$445.5\u00a0million in 2014 (including interest revenue). The CPB, and virtually all government-owned stations, are funded through general taxes, donations from individuals (usually in the form of \"memberships\"), and charitable organizations. Individual programs on public broadcasters may be supported by underwriting spots paid for by sponsors. Between 53 and 60 percent of public television's revenues come from private membership donations and grants, so most stations solicit individual donations by fundraising, pledge drives or telethons which can disrupt regularly scheduled programming. Normal programming can be replaced with specials aimed at a wider audience to solicit new members and donations.\nIn some rural areas of the United States, broadcast translator districts exist, which are funded by an ad valorem property tax on all property within the district, or by a parcel tax on each dwelling unit within the district. Failure to pay the TV translator tax has the same repercussions as failing to pay any other property tax, including a lien placed on the property and eventual seizure. In addition, fines can be levied on viewers who watch TV from the translator signals without paying the fee. As the Federal Communications Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over broadcast stations, whether a local authority can legally impose a fee merely to watch an over-the-air broadcast station is questionable. In some areas the tax is charged regardless of whether the resident watches TV from the translator. In other areas the property owner may certify that they do not use the translator district's services and get a waiver.\nCable television franchise fee agreements are added to cable TV bills to fund public, educational, and government access (PEG) television for the municipality that granted the franchise agreement. State governments may also add taxes. These taxes generate controversy since they sometimes go into the general taxation fund, or there is \"double taxation\" where public-access television is paid for by taxes but the cable television operator has to pay for equipment or facilities, or has to pay for local municipality projects that are not related to television.\nUruguay.\nUruguay does not have a fee or TV licence. The two public broadcasters in the country, Canal 5 and RNU, are funded by government grants.\nVietnam.\nVietnam has never had a television licence fee. Advertising was introduced in the early 1990s as a way to generate revenue for television stations. The current state broadcaster, Vietnam Television, receives the majority of its funds through advertising and some from government subsidies. Local television stations in Vietnam are operated in a similar way.\nDetection of television licence evasion.\nIn many jurisdictions, television licences are enforced. Detection of illegal television sets can be as simple as observing the lights and sounds of a television used in a property without a licence.\nTelevision detector vans have been employed by TV Licensing in the United Kingdom, with various detection techniques reported. \nAn effort to compel the BBC to release key information about the television detection equipment under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 was rejected. The BBC stated, \"Detection equipment is complex to deploy as its use is strictly governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (British Broadcasting Corporation) Order 2001. RIPA and the Order outline how relevant investigatory powers are to be used by the BBC and ensure compliance with human rights.\"\nThe BBC resisted further Freedom of Information Act requests seeking data on the estimated evasion rate for each of the nations of the UK.\nOpinions of television licensing systems.\nAdvocates argue that a main advantage of television fully funded by a licence fee is that programming can be enjoyed without interruptions for advertisements. Europeans tend to watch television for one hour less per day than North Americans, but because of differences in advertising may be enjoying the same amount of television content in that shorter time. \nTelevision funded by advertising is not truly free of cost to consumers as the cost of advertising is passed on in the price of products.\nCritics of receiver licensing point out that a licence is a regressive form of taxation. In contrast, costs from advertising are paid proportion to the consumption of advertised goods. The experience with broadcast deregulation in Europe suggests that demand for commercial-free content is not as high as once thought.\nIn 2004, the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport asked the public what it thought of various funding alternatives. Fifty-nine per cent of respondents agreed with the statement \"Advertising would interfere with my enjoyment of programmes\", while 31 per cent disagreed. 71 per cent agreed with the statement \"subscription funding would be unfair to those that could not pay\", while 16 per cent disagreed. An independent study showed that more than two-thirds of people polled thought that the licence fee should be dropped due to other subscription television services. The Department concluded that the licence fee was \"the least worse [\"sic\"] option\", \nand in 2005 the British government described the licence fee system as \"the best (and most widely supported) funding model, even though it is not perfect\".\nIn 2018 there was a referendum in Switzerland on whether TV licensing should be scrapped, in which voters rejected abolition by 71.6 per cent to 28.4 per cent. Legislators in Bulgaria have attempted to introduce a television licence. In Bulgaria, a fee is specified in the broadcasting law but has never been implemented. Lithuania and Latvia have debated the introduction of a licence fee but have not legislated for one. In the case of Latvia, some analysts believe this is partly because the government is unwilling to relinquish control of Latvijas Telev\u012bzija, which it gains from directly funding the service.\nThe Czech Republic increased the proportion of funding that the public broadcaster gets from licence fees, justifying the move with the argument that the existing public service broadcasters cannot compete with commercial broadcasters for advertising revenues.\nInternet-based broadcast access.\nThe Internet allows television and radio programmes to be easily accessed outside their country of origin. Where national broadcasters have streaming services, there would be no technological difficulties in accessing these programmes internationally. However, countries with TV licensing systems often do not have a way for potential international viewers to pay for a licence. Instead, they work to prevent international access because licensing rules have not adapted to the possible global audience.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His novels and short stories, which almost always take place in his native Scotland, are known for their gritty depictions of working class life and its intricacies; particularly drug addiction, social alienation, lack of opportunity and boredom, amongst others.\nHe is best known for his 1993 debut novel \"Trainspotting\", which was adapted into a film of the same name; both were highly acclaimed and are cult classics in their respective mediums. The novel was ranked 7th in a 2016 public poll of the best Scottish novels of all time, while its film adaptation was named the best Scottish film of all time in an equivalent 2004 poll. \nIn addition to his novels, Welsh has also written plays, screenplays, and directed several short films. As of 2025, his written works have sold 6 million copies worldwide.\nEarly life.\nIrvine Welsh was born in Leith, the port area of Edinburgh. He states that he was born in 1958. When he was four, his family moved to Muirhouse, in Edinburgh, where they stayed in local housing schemes. His mother worked as a waitress. His father was a dock worker in Leith until bad health forced him to stop, after which he became a carpet salesman; he died when Welsh was 25. Welsh left Ainslie Park High School when he was 16 and then completed a City and Guilds course in electrical engineering. He became an apprentice TV repairman until an electric shock persuaded him to move on to a series of other jobs. He left Edinburgh for the London punk scene in 1978, where he played guitar and sang in The Pubic Lice and Stairway 13. A series of arrests for petty crimes and finally a suspended sentence for trashing a North London community centre inspired Welsh to correct his ways. He worked for Hackney Council in London and studied computing with the support of the Manpower Services Commission.\nWelsh returned to Edinburgh in the late 1980s, where he worked for the city council in the housing department. He then studied for an MBA at Heriot-Watt University.\nFiction.\nWelsh has published eleven novels and four collections of short stories. His first novel, \"Trainspotting\", was published in 1993. Set in the mid-1980s, it uses a series of non-linear and loosely connected short-stories to tell the story of a group of characters tied together by decaying friendships, heroin addiction and stabs at escape from the oppressive boredom and brutality of their lives in the social housing schemes. It was released to shock and outrage in some circles and great acclaim in others. It was adapted as a play, and a film adaptation, directed by Danny Boyle and written by John Hodge, was released in 1996. Welsh appeared in the film in the minor role of drug dealer Mikey Forrester.\nNext, Welsh released \"The Acid House\", a collection of short stories from \"Rebel Inc.\", \"New Writing Scotland\" and other sources. Many of the stories take place in and around the housing schemes from \"Trainspotting\", and employ many of the same themes; a touch of fantasy is apparent in stories such as \"The Acid House\", where the minds of a baby and a drug user swap bodies, or \"The Granton Star Cause\", where God transforms a man into a fly as punishment for wasting his life. Welsh adapted three of the stories for a later film of the same name, in which he also appeared.\nWelsh's third book (and second novel), \"Marabou Stork Nightmares\", alternates between a grim tale of thugs and schemes in sub-working class Scotland and a hallucinatory adventure tale set in South Africa.\nHis next book, \"\" (1996), became his most high-profile work since \"Trainspotting\", released in the wave of publicity surrounding the film. It consists of three unconnected novellas: the first, \"Lorraine Goes To Livingston\", is a bawdy satire of classic British romance novels, the second, \"Fortune's Always Hiding\", is a revenge story involving thalidomide and the third, \"The Undefeated\", is a sly, subtle romance between a young woman dissatisfied with the confines of her suburban life and an aging clubgoer.\nA corrupt police officer and his tapeworm served as the narrators for his third novel, \"Filth\" (1998). The main character of \"Filth\" was a vicious sociopathic policeman. The novel was adapted to a film of the same name in 2013.\n\"Glue\" (2001) was a return to the locations, themes and episodic form of \"Trainspotting\", telling the stories of four characters spanning several decades in their lives and the bonds that held them together.\nHaving revisited some of them in passing in \"Glue\", Welsh brought most of the \"Trainspotting\" characters back for a sequel, \"Porno\", in 2002. In this book Welsh explores the impact of pornography on the individuals involved in producing it, as well as society as a whole, and the impact of aging and maturity in individuals against their will. The book is set just after the opening of the new Scottish Parliament.\n\"The Bedroom Secrets of the Master Chefs\" (2006), deals with a young, alcoholic civil servant who finds himself inadvertently putting a curse on his nemesis, a nerdy co-worker. In 2007, Welsh published \"If You Liked School You'll Love Work\", his first collection of short stories in over a decade.\nWelsh contributed a novella called \"Contamination\" to \"The Weekenders: Travels in the Heart of Africa\". Welsh, Ian Rankin, and Alexander McCall Smith each contributed a short story for the \"One City\" compilation published in 2005 in benefit of the One City Trust for social inclusion in Edinburgh. In \"Crime\", Ray Lennox (from Welsh's previous work, \"Filth\") is recovering from a mental breakdown induced by occupational stress and cocaine abuse, and a particularly horrifying child sex murder case back in Edinburgh. The story takes place in Florida. \nWelsh's prequel to \"Trainspotting\", titled \"Skagboys\", was published in 2012. Set in Leith in the early 1980s, it introduces the \"Trainspotting\" characters and follows them as they fall into heroin addiction. Given as a series of linked short stories, the book is also interspersed with brief commentaries on contemporary British politics. In particular, the consequences of the destruction of industry in the northern cities are drawn for the young working class. His eighth novel, \"The Sex Lives of Siamese Twins\", was published in May 2014 and his ninth novel titled \"A Decent Ride\" was published by Vintage Books in April 2015. The latter work featured the returning character 'Juice' Terry Lawson (previously from \"Glue\" and \"Porno\").\nWelsh's tenth novel, released in April 2016, \"The Blade Artist\", centres around a seemingly rehabilitated Francis Begbie now living in California with a wife and children. It was shortlisted for the Fiction Book of the Year at Saltire Literary Awards 2016.\nA sequel to \"The Blade Artist\", entitled \"Dead Men's Trousers\", was released on 29 March 2018, and sees Mark Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud reuniting with Francis Begbie.\nIn 2021, a TV adaptation of \"Crime\" was launched in the UK on BritBox as a six-episode series starring Dougray Scott as detective Lennox. Welsh worked on the project with Dean Cavanagh. This was the first TV adaptation of a book by Welsh. A second six-episode series has since been made and is currently available on ITV and ITVX.\nFilm and stage.\nAs well as fiction, Irvine Welsh has written several stage plays, including \"Headstate\", \"You'll Have Had Your Hole\", and the musical \"Blackpool\", which featured original songs by Vic Godard of the Subway Sect.\nHe co-authored \"Babylon Heights\" with his screen writing partner Dean Cavanagh. The play premiered in San Francisco at the Exit Theatre and made its European premi\u00e8re in Dublin, at The Mill Theatre Dundrum, directed by Graham Cantwell. The plot revolves around the behind-the-scenes antics of a group of Munchkins on the set of \"The Wizard of Oz\". The production included the use of oversized sets with actors of regular stature.\nCavanagh and Welsh have also collaborated on screenplays. \"The Meat Trade\" is based on the 19th-century West Port murders. Despite the historical source material, Welsh has set the story in the familiar confines of present-day Edinburgh, with Burke and Hare depicted as brothers who steal human organs to meet the demands of the global transplant market.\n\"Wedding Belles\", a film made for Channel 4 that was written by Welsh and Cavanagh, aired at the end of March 2007. The film centres around the lives of four young women, who are played by Michelle Gomez, Shirley Henderson, Shauna MacDonald, and Kathleen McDermot. \"Wedding Belles\" was nominated for a Scottish BAFTA and was subsequently sold to TV channels in Canada and Europe.\nWelsh has directed several short films for bands. In 2001 he directed a 15-minute film for Gene's song \"Is It Over\" which is taken from the album \"Libertine\". In 2006 he directed a short film to accompany the track \"Atlantic\" from Keane's album \"Under the Iron Sea\".\nWelsh directed his first short dramatic film, \"NUTS\", which he co-wrote with Cavanagh. The film features Joe McKinney as a man dealing with testicular cancer in post Celtic tiger Ireland. It was released in 2007.\nWelsh co-directed \"The Right to liberty\", a chapter of the documentary film \"The New Ten Commandments\", in 2008.\nIn 2009, Welsh directed the film \"Good Arrows\" (co-directed by Helen Grace). It was written by Welsh and Cavanagh. The film is about a darts player who suffers from depression which causes him to lose his skill.\nThemes.\nAs well as recreational drug use, Welsh's fiction and non-fiction is dominated by the question of working class and Scottish identity in the period spanning the 1960s to the present day. Within this, he explores the rise and fall of the council housing scheme, denial of opportunity, low-paid work, unemployment, social assistance, sectarianism, football, hooliganism, sex, suppressed homosexuality, dance clubs, freemasonry, Irish republicanism, sodomy, class divisions, emigration and, perhaps most of all, the humour, prejudices and axioms of the Scots.\nSam Leith, writing in the \"Financial Times\", argues that: \"Welsh's concerns are with sin and salvation, with the exercise of free will and with the individual soul. He's much more interested in teleology than sociology.\"\nStyle.\nWelsh's novels share characters, giving the feel of a \"shared universe\" within his writing. For example, characters from \"Trainspotting\" make cameo appearances in \"The Acid House\", \"Marabou Stork Nightmares\", \"Ecstasy\", \"Filth\", and slightly larger appearances in \"Glue\", whose characters then appear in \"Porno\".\nWelsh is known for writing in his native Edinburgh dialect of Scots. He generally ignores the traditional conventions of literary Scots, used for example by Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson, Robert Burns, Robert Louis Stevenson, and James Orr. Instead, he transcribes dialects phonetically.\nLike Alasdair Gray before him, Welsh also experiments with typography. In the novel \"Filth\", the tapeworm's internal monologue is imposed over the top of the protagonist's own internal monologue (the worm's host), visibly depicting the tapeworm's voracious appetite, much like the \"Climax of Voices\" in Gray's novel \"1982, Janine\".\nPersonal life.\nWelsh married Beth Quinn in 2005. They were divorced in 2018. They had lived together in the Lakeview neighbourhood of Chicago, US, since 2009. Before that, he lived in Dublin. In 2018, he was living in Miami, US.\nIn 2022, he married Emma Currie, an actor and sister of Scottish musician Momus.\nIn Welsh's early 20s, he was addicted to heroin for 18 months while playing in punk-rock bands moving between Edinburgh and London.\nWelsh is an avid supporter of Hibernian F.C. The club is frequently referenced in his works.\nWelsh is a supporter of Scottish independence from the United Kingdom.\nAdaptations.\nTheatre.\nSource:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nCritical studies"}

Many thousands of variants exist. The 2007 catalogue \"The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants\" estimates that there are well over 2,000, and many more were considered too trivial for inclusion in the catalogue. \nContemporary chess variants.\nThe chess variants listed below are derived from chess by changing one or more of the many rules of the game. The rules can be grouped into categories, from the most innocuous (starting position) to the most dramatic (adding chance/randomness to the gameplay after the initial piece placement). If a variant changes rules from multiple categories, it belongs to the sub-section below corresponding to the later-listed category.\nNames that represent a set of variants are annotated with \"[multivariant]\" after their name. All variants use an 8x8 board unless otherwise specified.\nVariant starting position (rectangular board, standard piece types and rules).\nMany variants employ standard chess rules and mechanics, but vary the number of pieces, or their starting positions. In most such variants, the pawns are placed on their usual squares, but the position of other pieces is either randomly determined or selected by the players. The motivation for these variants is usually to nullify established opening knowledge. The downside of these variants is that the initial position usually has less harmony and balance than the standard chess position.\nUnequal armies.\nIn these variants, White and Black do not necessarily begin with the same quantities of each piece type (for example, White may begin with more pawns than Black).\nVariants with fairy chess pieces.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVariants with fairy pieces on a standard board.\nMost of the pieces in these variants are borrowed from chess. The game goal and rules are also very similar to those in chess; however, these variants include one or more fairy pieces which move differently from chess pieces.\nVariants with popular fairy pieces: Empress, Amazon, Princess.\nThere are a number of variants which use the empress (rook + knight) and princess (bishop + knight) compound pieces. The empress is also called marshall or chancellor. The princess is also called cardinal, archbishop, janus, paladin, or minister. Another compound piece is the amazon (queen + knight). To adapt to the new pieces, the board is usually extended to 10\u00d78 or 10\u00d710 with additional pawns added.\nVariant rules.\nThese variants introduce changes in the mechanics of the game, such as movement of pieces, rules for capturing, or winning conditions.\nVariant move counts.\nIn these variants one or both players can move more than once per turn. The board and the pieces in these variants are the same as in standard chess.\nOther variant midgame rules.\nThese variants feature variant rules in the middle of the game, but the end goal remains the same (to checkmate the enemy king).\n\"Chad\" by Christian Freeling\nNon-rectangular board.\nIn this category, the movement of pieces can be modified in concurrence with the geometry of the board.\nHigher dimensional boards.\nA number of variants have been developed where the playing area is in three dimensions or more. In most cases an extra spatial dimension is represented by multiple boards being laid next to each other. Some extra-dimensional variants attempt to reflect the 3D nature of modern warfare (e.g. \"Raumschach\", designed to reflect aerial and submarine warfare), while others incorporate fantasy or science fiction ideas such as parallel worlds and time travel. An example of the latter is the variant introduced by the 2020 computer game \"5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel\", which uses a varying number of boards all being played in parallel.\nVariants with hidden information or use of chance.\nIn contrast to standard chess, which is a game of complete information, in these variants, the players do not have perfect information about the state of the board, or there is an element of chance in how the game is played after the initial setup of pieces.\nGames inspired by chess.\nThese variants are very different from chess and may be classified as abstract strategy board games instead of chess variants.\nChess-related historical and regional games.\nSome of these games have developed independently while others are ancestors or relatives of modern chess. The popularity of these variants may be limited to their respective places of origin (as is largely the case for shogi), or worldwide (as is the case for xiangqi). The games have their own institutions and traditions.\nHistorical.\nChaturaji\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\nFurther reading.\nShogi\nXiangqi\nOthers"}
{"id": "48557", "revid": "635492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48557", "title": "Archbishop", "text": "Bishop of higher rank in many Christian denominations\nIn Christian denominations, an archbishop is a bishop of higher rank or office. In most cases, such as the Catholic Church, there are many archbishops who either have jurisdiction over an ecclesiastical province in addition to their own archdiocese (with some exceptions), or are otherwise granted a titular archbishopric. In others, such as the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the title is only borne by the leader of the denomination.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"archbishop\" () comes via the Latin . This in turn comes from the Greek , which has as components the etymons -, meaning 'chief', , 'over', and , 'guardian, watcher'.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest appearance of neither the title nor the role can be traced. The title of \"metropolitan\" was apparently well known by the 4th century, when there are references in the canons of the First Council of Nic\u00e6a of 325 and Council of Antioch of 341, though the term seems to be used generally for all higher ranks of bishop, including patriarchs. The term \"archbishop\" does not appear in the modern sense until the 6th century, although the role, above ordinary bishops but below patriarchs, seems to be established for metropolitans by the 5th century.\nWestern Christianity.\nMetropolitan archbishops.\nEpiscopal sees are generally arranged in groups in which one see's bishop has certain powers and duties of oversight over the others. He is known as the metropolitan archbishop of that see. In the Catholic Church, http:// indicates what these powers and duties are for a Latin Church metropolitan archbishop, while those of the head of an autonomous (\"sui iuris\") Eastern Catholic Churches are indicated in http:// of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. All Catholic metropolitans are archbishops, but not all archbishops are metropolitans, though most are.\nNon-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees.\nAs well as the much more numerous metropolitan sees, there are 77 Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank. In some cases, such a see is the only one in a country, such as Luxembourg or Monaco, too small to be divided into several dioceses so as to form an ecclesiastical province. In others, the title of archdiocese is for historical reasons attributed to a see that was once of greater importance.\nSome of these archdioceses are suffragans of a metropolitan archdiocese; examples are the Archdiocese of Avignon, which is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Marseille, and the Archdiocese of Trnava, Slovakia. Others are immediately subject to the Holy See and not to any metropolitan archdiocese. These are usually \"aggregated\" to an ecclesiastical province. An example is the Archdiocese of Hobart in Australia, associated with the Metropolitan ecclesiastical province of Melbourne, but not part of it. The ordinary of such an archdiocese is an archbishop.\nIn the Anglican Communion, non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees are much less common. The Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, established in 1841, was raised to the status of a non-metropolitan archiepiscopal see in 1957, but reduced to the status of an ordinary bishopric again in 1976. In 2014 it was again elevated to the status of non-metropolitan archbishopric, with its ordinary bearing the title \"Archbishop in Jerusalem\", despite having no ex officio right to be the metropolitan of the province.\nCoadjutor archbishops.\nUntil 1970, a coadjutor archbishop, one who has special faculties and the right to succeed to the leadership of a see on the death or resignation of the incumbent, was assigned also to a titular see, which he held until the moment of succession. Since then, the title of Coadjutor Archbishop of the see is considered sufficient and more appropriate.\nArchbishops \"ad personam\".\nThe rank of archbishop is conferred on some bishops who are not ordinaries of an archdiocese. They hold the rank not because of the see that they head but because it has been granted to them personally (\"ad personam\"). Such a grant can be given when someone who already holds the rank of archbishop is transferred to a see that, though its present-day importance may be greater than the person's former see, is not archiepiscopal. The bishop transferred is then known as the archbishop-bishop of his new see. An example is Gianfranco Gardin, appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Treviso on 21 December 2009. The title borne by the successor of such an archbishop-bishop is merely that of Bishop of the see, unless he also is granted the personal title of Archbishop. Another example is Arthur Roche, who was Bishop of Leeds until his appointment as Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Roche remained a bishop by virtue of his position as bishop emeritus of Leeds \u2013 rather than being transferred to a different titular archbishopric, he was appointed as an archbishop \"ad personam\".\nTitular archiepiscopal sees.\nThe distinction between metropolitan sees and non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees exists for titular sees as well as for residential ones. The \"Annuario Pontificio\" marks titular sees of the former class with the abbreviation \"Metr.\" and the others with \"Arciv.\"\nMany of the titular sees to which nuncios and heads of departments of the Roman Curia who are not cardinals are assigned are not of archiepiscopal rank. In that case the person who is appointed to such a position is given the personal title of archbishop (\"ad personam\"). They are usually referred to as archbishop of the see, not as its archbishop-bishop.\nArchbishops emeriti.\nIf an archbishop resigns his see without being transferred to another, as in the case of retirement or assignment to head a department of the Roman Curia, the word \"emeritus\" is added to his former title, and he is called archbishop emeritus of his former see. Until 1970, such archbishops were transferred to a titular see.\nThere can be several archbishops emeriti of the same see: the 2008 \"Annuario Pontificio\" listed three living archbishops emeriti of Taipei.\nThere is no archbishop emeritus of a titular see; an archbishop who holds a titular see keeps it until death or until transferred to another see.\nIn the Anglican Communion, retired archbishops formally revert to being addressed as \"bishop\" and styled \"The Right Reverend\", although they may be appointed \"archbishop emeritus\" by their province on retirement, in which case they retain the title \"archbishop\" and the style \"The Most Reverend\", as a right. Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a prominent example, as archbishop emeritus of Cape Town. Former archbishops who have not received the status of archbishop emeritus may still be informally addressed as \"archbishop\" as a courtesy, unless they are subsequently appointed to a bishopric (not an archbishopric), in which case the courtesy ceases.\nPrivileges of archbishops.\nWhile there is no difference between the official dress of archbishops, as such, and that of other bishops, Roman Catholic metropolitan archbishops are distinguished by the use in liturgical ceremonies of the pallium, but only within the province over which they have oversight.\nRoman Catholic bishops and archbishops are styled \"The Most Reverend\" and addressed as \"Your Excellency\" in most cases. In English-speaking countries (except the United States), a Catholic archbishop is addressed as \"Your Grace\", while a Catholic bishop is addressed as \"Your Lordship\". Before December 12, 1930, the title \"Most Reverend\" was only for archbishops, while bishops were styled as \"Right Reverend\". This practice is still followed by Catholic bishops in the United Kingdom to mirror that of the Church of England.\nIn Roman Catholic heraldry, an archbishop has an ecclesiastical hat called a galero with ten tassels on each side of his coat of arms, while a bishop has only six. The archiepiscopal cross behind the shield has two bars instead of one. Such a cross may be borne before him in liturgical processions.\nIn processions and other occasions where strict protocol is observed, archbishops are ranked higher than diocesan bishops in the order of precedence.\nIn the Anglican Communion, archbishops are styled \"The Most Reverend\" and addressed as \"Your Grace\", while bishops are styled \"The Right Reverend\" and addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"Your Lordship\". (In some countries, this usage is followed also by the Roman Catholic Church, but in others no distinction is made and \"The Most Reverend\" and \"Your Excellency\" are used for archbishops and bishops alike.) Anglican archbishops are entitled to be preceded by a server carrying an archiepiscopal processional cross (with two bars instead of one) in liturgical processions. The archbishop of Canterbury's metropolitical processional cross is always carried before him by a priest-chaplain, and (like other archbishops) is a two-barred processional cross. However, the archbishop of Canterbury is also entitled to be preceded by the ancient primatial cross of Canterbury (still in ceremonial use) which is of an ornate historical design, made of precious metal, and with precious stones inserted, but unlike his metropolitical cross (or those of other archbishops) it is not double-barred.\nEastern Christianity.\nArchbishops exist in all traditional denominations of Eastern Christianity, including the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Church of the East and the Eastern Catholic Churches.\nEastern Orthodox Church.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox churches, the office and title of archbishop can be traced from the 4th and 5th century. Historically, the title was used variously, in terms of rank and jurisdiction.\nIn some Eastern Orthodox churches, archbishops are ranked above metropolitans in precedence, while in others that order is reversed. Primates of autocephalous Eastern Orthodox churches below patriarchal rank are generally designated as archbishops. In the Greek Orthodox Church, archbishops are ranked above metropolitans in precedence. The reverse is true for some Slavic Orthodox churches (Russian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox) and also for Romanian Orthodox Church, where metropolitans rank above archbishops.\nIn terms of jurisdiction, there are two basic types of archbishops in the Eastern Orthodox Church: real archbishops and honorary archbishops. Real archbishops are primates of autocephalous or autonomous (regional) churches, and they have actual jurisdiction over other bishops, while honorary archbishops are in fact just diocesan bishops with honorary titles of archbishops and no jurisdiction outside their own diocese. The honorary title is usually conferred to bishops of historically important sees. For example, in the Serbian Orthodox Church, both types were represented: the head of the autonomous Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric is styled \"Archbishop of Ohrid\" and invested with regional jurisdiction over all diocesan bishops in North Macedonia, while former diocesan bishop (late Amfilohije Radovi\u0107) of the Eparchy of Montenegro and the Littoral, with seat in Cetinje, was personally given only the honorary title \"Archbishop of Cetinje\", but without any jurisdiction over other diocesan bishops in Montenegro.\nHistorically, within the Patriarchate of Constantinople, honorary archiepiscopal titles were also granted to those diocesan bishops who were exempt from jurisdictions of local metropolitans, and transferred to the direct jurisdiction of the patriarchal throne. Such titular hierarchs were contentiously styled as \"autocephalous archbishops\" (self-headed, just in terms of not having a metropolitan, but without connotations to real autocephaly). For example, until the end of the 8th century, bishop of Amorium was under the jurisdiction of metropolitan of Pessinus, but he was later exempt and placed under direct patriarchal jurisdiction. On that occasion, he was given an honorary title of an \"autocephalous archbishop\", but with no jurisdiction over other bishops. Sometime later (c.\u2009814), metropolitan province of Amorium was created, and local archbishop finally gained regional jurisdiction as a metropolitan.\nOriental Orthodox Churches.\nThe Oriental Orthodox custom generally agrees with the Slavic rather than the Greek with respect to the archbishop/metropolitan distinction.\nEastern Catholic Churches.\nInstead of the term \"archbishop\", Eastern Catholic Churches sometimes use the word \"archeparch\" by analogy with \"eparch\", the term used for a diocesan (or eparchial) bishop. However, the word \"archeparch\" is not found in the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It serves as a house of prayer (with a main sanctuary and sometimes smaller chapels) where Jews attend religious services or ceremonies such as weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs, choir performances, and children's plays. Synagogues often also contain study rooms, social halls, administrative and charitable offices, classrooms for religious and Hebrew studies, and spaces for community gatherings. They frequently display commemorative, historic, or modern artwork alongside items of Jewish historical significance or exhibits about the synagogue itself.\nSynagogues are buildings used for Jewish prayer, study, assembly, and reading of the Torah. The Torah (Pentateuch or Five Books of Moses) is traditionally read in its entirety over a period of a year in weekly portions during services, or in some synagogues on a triennial cycle. However, the edifice of a synagogue as such is not essential for holding Jewish worship. \"Halakha\" (Jewish law from the Mishnah \u2013 the \"Oral Torah\") states that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever a \"minyan\", a group of at least 10 Jewish adult men, is assembled, often (but not necessarily) led by a rabbi. This minyan is the essence of Jewish communal worship, which can also be conducted alone or with fewer than ten people, but that excludes certain prayers as well as communal Torah reading. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the long-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem.\nAny Jew or group of Jews can build a synagogue. Synagogues have been constructed by ancient Jewish leaders, wealthy patrons, and as part of a wide range of human institutions, including secular educational institutions, governments, and hotels. They have been built by the entire Jewish community living in a particular village or region, or by sub-groups of Jewish people organized by occupation, tradition/background (e.g., the Sephardic, Yemenite, Romaniote or Persian Jews of a town), style of religious observance (e.g., Orthodox or Reform synagogues), or by the followers of a particular rabbi, such as the shtiebelekh (, singular \"shtibl\") of Hasidic Judaism.\nTerminology.\nThe Hebrew term is ' (\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05db\u05e0\u05e1\u05ea) or \"house of assembly\". The Koine Greek-derived word \"synagogue\" (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae) also means \"assembly\" and is commonly used in English, with its earliest mention in the 1st century Theodotos inscription in Jerusalem. Ashkenazi Jews have traditionally used the Yiddish term ' (from the Greek \"schola\", which is also the source of the English \"school\") in everyday speech, and many continue to do so in English.\nSephardi Jews and Romaniote Jews generally use the term \"kal\" (from the Hebrew \"qahal\" \"community\"). Spanish and Portuguese Jews call the synagogue an and Portuguese Jews may call it a . Persian Jews and some Karaite Jews also use the term \"kenesa\", which is derived from Aramaic, and some Mizrahi Jews use \"kenis\" or \"qnis\", the Arabic word for a synagogue, or \"\u1e63la\", the Arabic word for prayer.\nHistory.\nIn the First Temple period, Jewish communal worship revolved around the Temple in Jerusalem, serving as a central focal point and significant symbol for the entire Jewish nation. As such, it was the destination for Jews making pilgrimages during the three major annual festivals commanded by the Torah: Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot. There is no evidence of non-sacrificial worship during this period. There are several known cases of Jewish communities in Egypt with their own temples, such as the Temple at Elephantine established by refugees from the Kingdom of Judah during the Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt, and a few centuries later, the Temple of Onias in the Heliopolite Nome.\nThe first synagogues emerged in the Jewish diaspora, probably after the Babylonian Exile of Judaea in 586 BCE, several centuries before their introduction to the Land of Israel. Evidence points to their existence as early as the Hellenistic period, notably in Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt, the world's foremost Greek-speaking city at the time. There, the first \"proseukh\u00e1i\" (; singular \"proseukh\u0113\") were built to provide a place for communal prayer and reading and studying the Torah. Alexandrian Jews also made a Koine Greek translation of the Torah, the Septuagint. The earliest archaeological evidence for the existence of synagogues is stone dedication inscriptions from the third century BCE prove that \"proseukh\u00e1i\" existed by that date. Philo and Josephus mention lavishly adorned synagogues in Alexandria and in Antioch, respectively.\nMore than a dozen Second Temple period synagogues in use by Jews and Samaritans have been identified by archaeologists in Israel and other countries of the Hellenistic world. Following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, who is often credited with reformulating Judaism for the post-Temple era, advocated for the establishment of individual houses of worship since the Temple was no longer accessible.\nIt has been theorized that the synagogue became a place of worship in the region upon the destruction of the Second Temple during the First Jewish\u2013Roman War; however, others speculate that there had been places of prayer, apart from the Temple, during the Hellenistic period. The popularization of prayer over sacrifice during the years prior to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE had prepared the Jews for life in the diaspora, where prayer would serve as the focus of Jewish worship.\nDespite the certain existence of synagogue-like spaces prior to the First Jewish\u2013Roman War, the synagogue emerged as a focal point for Jewish worship upon the destruction of the Temple. For Jews living in the wake of the Revolt, the synagogue functioned as a \"portable system of worship\". Within the synagogue, Jews worshipped by way of prayer rather than sacrifices, which had previously served as the main form of worship within the Second Temple.\nSecond Temple period.\nIn 2018, Mordechai Aviam reported that there were now at least nine synagogues excavated known to pre-date the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 70\u00a0CE, including in Magdala, Gamla, Masada, Herodium, Modi'in (Khan Umm el-'Umdan), Qiryat Sepher (Khan Bad 'Issa), and Khan Diab. Aviam concluded that he thought almost every Jewish settlement at the time, whether it was a polis or a village, had a synagogue.\nTalmudic period.\nFollowing the destruction of the Temple, the synagogue became the focal point of Jewish worship and communal life. Lester L. Grabbe writes: \"The rise of the synagogue was a fortuitous but vital development which paved the way for a post-temple Judaism which became necessary after 70 [...] Synagogues were not planned as a substitute for the temple but they were a useful vehicle to make the transition.\" Over time, prayers, rituals, and customs once performed in the Temple were adapted for synagogue use. Traditional forms of synagogal worship, including sermons and the reading of scripture, were preserved, while new forms of worship, such as and organized prayer, developed. Rabbinic instruction, however, maintained that certain practices should remain exclusive to the Temple. The Mishnah directed prayers toward Jerusalem, and most synagogues face the Temple site rather than mirroring its orientation, establishing them as extensions of its sanctity, not replicas.\nDuring Late antiquity (third to seventh century CE), literary sources attest to the existence of a large number of synagogues across the Roman-Byzantine and Sasanian Empires. Archaeological evidence indicates the presence of synagogues in at least thirteen places across the diaspora, spanning from Dura-Europos in Syria to Elche in Hispania (modern-day Spain). An especially sizable and monumental synagogue dating from this period is the Sardis Synagogue. Additionally, many inscriptions pertaining to synagogues and their officials have been discovered.\nIn the Land of Israel, late antiquity witnessed a significant increase in synagogue construction, in Galilee and Golan in the north and the southern hills of Judea, in the south. Each synagogue was constructed according to the means and religious customs of the local community. Notable examples include Capernaum, Bar'am, Beth Alpha, Maoz Haim, Meroth and Nabratein in the north, and Eshtemoa, Susya, Anim, and Maon in the south.\nMiddle Ages.\nRabbi and philosopher Maimonides (1138\u20131204) described the various customs in his day with respect to local synagogues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Synagogues and houses of study must be treated with respect. They are swept and sprinkled [with water] to lay the dust. In Spain and the Maghreb, in Babylonia and in the Holy Land, it is customary to kindle lamps in the synagogues and to spread mats on the floor upon which the worshippers sit. In the lands of Edom (Christendom), they sit in synagogues upon chairs [or benches].\nSamaritan synagogues.\nName and history.\nThe Samaritan house of worship is also called a synagogue. During the third and second centuries BCE, the Hellenistic period, the Greek word used in the Diaspora by Samaritans and Jews was the same, \"proseukh\u0113\" , plural \"prosukh\u00e1i\"); a third or fourth century inscription uses a similar term, \"eukt\u0113rion\".\nThe oldest Samaritan synagogue discovered so far is from Delos in the Aegean Islands, with an inscription dated between 250 and 175\u00a0BCE, while most Samaritan synagogues excavated in the wider Land of Israel and ancient Samaria in particular, were built in the fourth to seventh centuries at the very end of the Roman Empire and throughout the Byzantine period.\nDistinguishing elements.\nThe elements which distinguish Samaritan synagogues from contemporary Jewish ones are:\nArchaeological finds.\nAncient Samaritan synagogues are mentioned by literary sources or have been found by archaeologists in the Diaspora, in the wider Holy Land, and specifically in Samaria.\nChristianity.\nIn the New Testament, the word appears 56 times, mostly in the Synoptic Gospels, but also in the Gospel of John () and the Book of Revelation (). It is used in the sense of 'assembly' in the Epistle of James (). Alternatively, the epistle of James (in Greek, clearly \u1f38\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 or \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1, anglicized to Jacob) refers to a place of assembly that was indeed Jewish, with Jacob ben Joseph perhaps an elder there. The specific word in James (Jacob) 2:2 could easily be rendered \"synagogue\", from the Greek \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u1f74\u03bd.\nIn 1995, Howard Clark Kee argued that synagogues were not a developed feature of Jewish life prior to the First Jewish\u2013Roman War (66-73 CE) and that the mentions of synagogues in the New Testament, including Jesus's visitations of synagogues in various Jewish settlements in Israel, were anachronistic. However, archaeologists have discovered first-century synagogues, and Chris Keith and Anders Runesson find it almost certain that the historical Jesus preached in synagogues in Galilee.\nDuring the first Christian centuries, Jewish Christians are hypothesized to have used houses of worship known in academic literature as synagogue-churches. Scholars have claimed to have identified such houses of worship of the Jews who had accepted Jesus as the Messiah in Jerusalem and Nazareth.\nArchitectural design.\nThere is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. In fact, the influence from other local religious buildings can often be seen in synagogue arches, domes and towers.\nHistorically, synagogues were built in the prevailing architectural style of their time and place. Thus, the synagogue in Kaifeng, China, looked very much like Chinese temples of that region and era, with its outer wall and open garden in which several buildings were arranged. The styles of the earliest synagogues resembled the temples of other cults of the Eastern Roman Empire. The surviving synagogues of medieval Spain are embellished with mud\u00e9jar plasterwork. The surviving medieval synagogues in Budapest and Prague are typical Gothic structures.\nWith the emancipation of Jews in Western European countries in the 19th century\u2014which not only enabled Jews to enter fields of enterprise from which they were formerly barred, but gave them the right to build synagogues without needing special permissions\u2014synagogue architecture blossomed. Large Jewish communities wished to show not only their wealth but also their newly acquired status as citizens by constructing magnificent synagogues. These were built across Western Europe and in the United States in all of the historicist or revival styles then in fashion. Thus there were Neoclassical, Renaissance Revival architecture, Neo-Byzantine, Romanesque Revival, Moorish Revival, Gothic Revival, and Greek Revival. There are Egyptian Revival synagogues and even one Mayan Revival synagogue. In the 19th-century and early-20th-century heyday of historicist architecture, however, most historicist synagogues, even the most magnificent ones, did not attempt a pure style, or even any particular style, and are best described as eclectic.\nIn the post-war era, synagogue architecture abandoned historicist styles for modernism.\nInterior elements.\nBimah.\nAll synagogues contain a \"bimah\" (, platform or pulpit; plural \"bimot\"), a large, raised, reader's platform, where the Torah scroll is placed to be read. In Sephardi synagogues and traditional Ashkenazi synagogues, it is also used as the prayer leader's reading desk.\nThe term is post-biblical Hebrew, and almost certainly derived from the Ancient Greek word for a raised platform, \"bema\" (). A link to the Biblical Hebrew \"bama\" (), 'high place' has been suggested. It is also known as the \"almemar\" or \"almemor\" among some Ashkenazi Jews, from Arabic \"minbar\" \"pulpit\". Among Sephardic Jews, it is known as a \"t\u0113\u1e07\u0101h\" (, box or case) or \"migdal-etz\" ('tower of wood').\nIn Orthodox Judaism, the bimah is located in the center of the synagogue, separate from the Torah ark. In other branches of Judaism, the bimah and the ark are joined together.\nThe bimah is raised to demonstrate the importance of the Torah reader, and to make it easier to hear the recitation of the Torah. In antiquity, the bimah was made of stone, but in modern times it is usually a rectangular wooden platform approached by steps. Over time, it became a standard fixture in synagogues, where the weekly Torah portion and haftara are read. The platform is typically elevated by two or three steps, as in the ancient Temple. It will generally have a railing, which is a halakhic safety regulation for platforms more than ten handbreadths high, between . A lower bimah (even one step) will sometimes have a railing as a practical measure to prevent someone from stepping off inadvertently.\nAt the celebration of Shavuot, when synagogues are decorated with flowers, many synagogues have special arches that they place over the bima and adorn with floral displays.\nTable or lectern.\nIn Ashkenazi synagogues, the Torah was read on a reader's table located in the center of the room, while the leader of the prayer service, the hazzan, stood at a lectern or table in the front, facing the Ark. In Sephardic synagogues, the table for reading the Torah (reading dais) was commonly placed at the opposite side of the room from the Torah Ark, leaving the center of the floor empty for the use of a ceremonial procession carrying the Torah between the Ark and the reading table. Most contemporary synagogues feature a lectern for the rabbi.\nTorah Ark.\nThe Torah Ark, called in Hebrew &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9\u200e \"Aron Kodesh\" or 'holy chest'\n, and alternatively called the \"heikhal\"\u2014&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05dc\u200e or 'temple' by Sephardic Jews, is a cabinet in which the Torah scrolls are kept.\nThe ark in a synagogue is almost always positioned in such a way such that those who face it are facing towards Jerusalem. Thus, sanctuary seating plans in the Western world generally face east, while those east of Israel face west. Sanctuaries in Israel face towards Jerusalem and in Jerusalem towards the Temple Mount. Occasionally, synagogues face other directions for structural reasons; in such cases, some individuals might turn to face Jerusalem when standing for prayers, but the congregation as a whole does not.\nThe Ark is reminiscent of the Ark of the Covenant, which held the tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue, also reminiscent of the Holy of Holies. The Ark is often closed with an ornate curtain, the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05db\u05ea\u200e, which hangs outside or inside the ark doors.\nEternal Light.\nOther traditional features include a continually lit lamp or lantern, usually electric in contemporary synagogues, called the (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e0\u05e8 \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u200e), the \"Eternal Light\", used as a way to honor the Divine Presence.\nInner decoration.\nA synagogue may be decorated with artwork, but in the Rabbinic and Orthodox tradition, three-dimensional sculptures and depictions of the human body are not allowed as these are considered akin to idolatry.\nSeating.\nOriginally, synagogues were made devoid of much furniture, the Jewish congregants in Spain, the Maghreb (North Africa), Babylonia, the Land of Israel and Yemen having a custom to sit upon the floor, which had been strewn with mats and cushions, rather than upon chairs or benches. In other European towns and cities, however, Jewish congregants would sit upon chairs and benches. Today, the custom has spread in all places to sit upon chairs and benches.\nIn an Ashkenazi synagogue, all seats most often face the Torah Ark, meaning that congregants sit in rows. In a Sephardic synagogue, seats are usually arranged around the perimeter of the sanctuary, but during the main prayer, Amidah, everyone face the Ark.\nSpecial seats.\nMany current synagogues have an elaborate chair named for the prophet Elijah, which is only sat upon during the ceremony of \"brit milah\".\nIn ancient synagogues, a special chair placed on the wall facing Jerusalem and next to the Torah Shrine was reserved for the prominent members of the congregation and for important guests. Such a stone-carved and inscribed seat was discovered at archaeological excavations in the synagogue at Chorazin in Galilee and dates from the 4th\u20136th century; another one was discovered at the Delos Synagogue, complete with a footstool.\nRules for attendees.\nRemoving one's shoes.\nIn Yemen, the Jewish custom was to remove one's shoes immediately prior to entering the synagogue, a custom that had been observed by Jews in other places in earlier times. The same practice of removing one's shoes before entering the synagogue was also largely observed among Jews in Morocco in the early 20th century. On the island of Djerba in Tunisia, Jews still remove their shoes when entering a synagogue. The custom of removing one's shoes is no longer practiced in Israel, the United Kingdom, or the United States, and which custom, as in former times, was dependent upon whether or not the wearer considered it a thing of contempt to stand before God while wearing shoes. In Christian countries, where it was thought not offensive to stand before a king while wearing shoes, it was likewise permitted to do so in a house of prayer. However, in Karaite Judaism, the custom of removing one's shoes prior to entering a synagogue is still observed worldwide.\nGender separation.\nIn Orthodox synagogues, men and women do not sit together. The synagogue features a partition () dividing the men's and women's seating areas, or a separate women's section located on a balcony.\nDenominational differences.\nReform Judaism.\nThe German\u2013Jewish Reform movement, which arose in the early 19th century, made many changes to the traditional look of the synagogue, keeping with its desire to simultaneously stay Jewish yet be accepted by the surrounding culture.\nThe first Reform synagogue, which opened in Hamburg in 1811, introduced changes that made the synagogue look more like a church. These included: the installation of an organ to accompany the prayers (even on Shabbat, when musical instruments are proscribed by halakha), a choir to accompany the hazzan, and vestments for the synagogue rabbi to wear.\nIn following decades, the central reader's table, the Bimah, was moved to the front of the Reform sanctuary\u2014previously unheard-of in Orthodox synagogues.\nGender separation was also removed.\nSynagogue as community center.\nSynagogues often take on a broader role in modern Jewish communities and may include additional facilities such as a catering hall, kosher kitchen, religious school, library, day care center and a smaller chapel for daily services.\nSynagogue offshoots.\nSince many Orthodox and some non-Orthodox Jews prefer to collect a minyan (a quorum of ten men) rather than pray alone, they commonly assemble at pre-arranged times in offices, living rooms, or other spaces when these are more convenient than formal synagogue buildings. A room or building that is used this way can become a dedicated small synagogue or prayer room. Among Ashkenazi Jews they are traditionally called (, pl. or , Yiddish for \"little house\"), and are found in Orthodox communities worldwide.\nAnother type of communal prayer group, favored by some contemporary Jews, is the \"chavurah\" (, pl. \"chavurot\", ), or prayer fellowship. These groups meet at a regular place and time, either in a private home or in a synagogue or other institutional space. In antiquity, the Pharisees lived near each other in \"chavurot\" and dined together to ensure that none of the food was unfit for consumption.\nList of \"great synagogues\".\nSome synagogues bear the title \"Great Synagogue\".\nEurope.\nUkraine\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A forest is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by at most one path, or equivalently an acyclic undirected graph, or equivalently a disjoint union of trees.\nA directed tree, oriented tree, polytree, or singly connected network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. A polyforest (or directed forest or oriented forest) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a forest.\nThe various kinds of data structures referred to as trees in computer science have underlying graphs that are trees in graph theory, although such data structures are generally rooted trees. A rooted tree may be directed, called a directed rooted tree, either making all its edges point away from the root\u2014in which case it is called an arborescence or out-tree\u2014or making all its edges point towards the root\u2014in which case it is called an anti-arborescence or in-tree. A rooted tree itself has been defined by some authors as a directed graph. A rooted forest is a disjoint union of rooted trees. A rooted forest may be directed, called a directed rooted forest, either making all its edges point away from the root in each rooted tree\u2014in which case it is called a branching or out-forest\u2014or making all its edges point towards the root in each rooted tree\u2014in which case it is called an anti-branching or in-forest.\nThe term tree was coined in 1857 by the British mathematician Arthur Cayley.\nDefinitions.\nTree.\nA \"tree\" is an undirected graph G that satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:\nIf G has finitely many vertices, say n of them, then the above statements are also equivalent to any of the following conditions:\nAs elsewhere in graph theory, the order-zero graph (graph with no vertices) is generally not considered to be a tree: while it is vacuously connected as a graph (any two vertices can be connected by a path), it is not 0-connected (or even (\u22121)-connected) in algebraic topology, unlike non-empty trees, and violates the \"one more vertex than edges\" relation. It may, however, be considered as a forest consisting of zero trees.\nAn internal vertex (or inner vertex) is a vertex of degree at least 2. Similarly, an external vertex (or outer vertex, terminal vertex or leaf) is a vertex of degree 1. A branch vertex in a tree is a vertex of degree at least 3.\nAn irreducible tree (or series-reduced tree) is a tree in which there is no vertex of degree 2 (enumerated at sequence in the OEIS).\nForest.\nA forest is an undirected acyclic graph or equivalently a disjoint union of trees. Trivially so, each connected component of a forest is a tree. As special cases, the order-zero graph (a forest consisting of zero trees), a single tree, and an edgeless graph, are examples of forests.\nSince for every tree \"V\" \u2212 \"E\" = 1, we can easily count the number of trees that are within a forest by subtracting the difference between total vertices and total edges. \"V\" \u2212 \"E\" = number of trees in a forest.\nPolytree.\nA polytree (or \"directed tree\" or \"oriented tree\" or \"singly connected network\") is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. In other words, if we replace its directed edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is both connected and acyclic.\nSome authors restrict the phrase \"directed tree\" to the case where the edges are all directed towards a particular vertex, or all directed away from a particular vertex (see arborescence).\nPolyforest.\nA polyforest (or directed forest or oriented forest) is a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a forest. In other words, if we replace its directed edges with undirected edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is acyclic.\nAs with directed trees, some authors restrict the phrase \"directed forest\" to the case where the edges of each connected component are all directed towards a particular vertex, or all directed away from a particular vertex (see branching).\nRooted tree.\nA rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated the root. The edges of a rooted tree can be assigned a natural orientation, either away from or towards the root, in which case the structure becomes a directed rooted tree. When a directed rooted tree has an orientation away from the root, it is called an \"arborescence\" or \"out-tree\"; when it has an orientation towards the root, it is called an \"anti-arborescence\" or \"in-tree\". The tree-order is the partial ordering on the vertices of a tree with \"u\" &lt; \"v\" if and only if the unique path from the root to v passes through u. A rooted tree T that is a subgraph of some graph G is a normal tree if the ends of every T-path in G are comparable in this tree-order . Rooted trees, often with an additional structure such as an ordering of the neighbors at each vertex, are a key data structure in computer science; see tree data structure.\nIn a context where trees typically have a root, a tree without any designated root is called a \"free tree\".\nA \"labeled tree\" is a tree in which each vertex is given a unique label. The vertices of a labeled tree on n vertices (for nonnegative integers n) are typically given the labels 1, 2, \u2026, \"n\". A \"recursive tree\" is a labeled rooted tree where the vertex labels respect the tree order (i.e., if \"u\" &lt; \"v\" for two vertices u and v, then the label of u is smaller than the label of v).\nIn a rooted tree, the \"parent\" of a vertex v is the vertex connected to v on the path to the root; every vertex has a unique parent, except the root has no parent. A \"child\" of a vertex v is a vertex of which v is the parent. An \"ascendant\" of a vertex v is any vertex that is either the parent of v or is (recursively) an ascendant of a parent of v. A \"descendant\" of a vertex v is any vertex that is either a child of v or is (recursively) a descendant of a child of v. A \"sibling\" to a vertex v is any other vertex on the tree that shares a parent with v. A \"leaf\" is a vertex with no children. An \"internal vertex\" is a vertex that is not a leaf.\nThe \"height\" of a vertex in a rooted tree is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that vertex. The \"height\" of the tree is the height of the root. The \"depth\" of a vertex is the length of the path to its root (\"root path\"). The depth of a tree is the maximum depth of any vertex. Depth is commonly needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, AVL trees in particular. The root has depth zero, leaves have height zero, and a tree with only a single vertex (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (a tree with no vertices, if such are allowed) has depth and height \u22121.\nA \"k-ary tree\" (for nonnegative integers k) is a rooted tree in which each vertex has at most k children. 2-ary trees are often called \"binary trees\", while 3-ary trees are sometimes called \"ternary trees\".\nOrdered tree.\nAn \"ordered tree\" (alternatively, \"plane tree\" or \"positional tree\") is a rooted tree in which an ordering is specified for the children of each vertex. This is called a \"plane tree\" because an ordering of the children is equivalent to an embedding of the tree in the plane, with the root at the top and the children of each vertex lower than that vertex. Given an embedding of a rooted tree in the plane, if one fixes a direction of children, say left to right, then an embedding gives an ordering of the children. Conversely, given an ordered tree, and conventionally drawing the root at the top, then the child vertices in an ordered tree can be drawn left-to-right, yielding an essentially unique planar embedding.\nEnumeration.\nLabeled trees.\nCayley's formula states that there are \"n\"\"n\"\u22122 trees on n labeled vertices. A classic proof uses Pr\u00fcfer sequences, which naturally show a stronger result: the number of trees with vertices 1, 2, \u2026, \"n\" of degrees \"d\"1, \"d\"2, \u2026, \"dn\" respectively, is the multinomial coefficient\n formula_1\nA more general problem is to count spanning trees in an undirected graph, which is addressed by the matrix tree theorem.

{"id": "48563", "revid": "50148106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48563", "title": "Air traffic control", "text": "Service to direct pilots of aircraft\nAir traffic control (ATC) is a service provided by ground-based air traffic controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and through controlled airspace. The primary purpose of ATC is to prevent collisions, organise and expedite the flow of air traffic, and provide information and other support for pilots. In some countries, ATC can also provide advisory services to aircraft in non-controlled airspace. \nControllers monitor the location of aircraft in their assigned airspace using radar and communicate with pilots by radio. To prevent collisions, ATC enforces traffic separation rules, which ensure each aircraft maintains a minimum amount of empty space around it. ATC services are provided to all types of aircraft, including private, military, and commercial flights.\nDepending on the type of flight and the class of airspace, ATC may issue mandatory \"instructions\" or non-binding \"advisories\" (known as \"flight information\" in some countries). While pilots are required to obey all ATC instructions, the pilot in command of an aircraft always retains final authority for its safe operation. In an emergency, the pilot may deviate from ATC instructions to the extent required to maintain the safety of the aircraft. Weather conditions, such as thunderstorms, strong winds, and low visibility, can significantly affect air traffic control operations, leading to delays, diversions, and the need for alternate routing.\nLanguage.\nPursuant to requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), ATC operations are conducted either in the English language, or the local language used by the station on the ground. In practice, the native language for a region is used; however, English must be used upon request.\nHistory.\nIn 1920, Croydon Airport near London, England, was the first airport in the world to introduce air traffic control. The 'aerodrome control tower' was a wooden hut high with windows on all four sides. It was commissioned on 25 February 1920, and provided basic traffic, weather, and location information to pilots.\nIn the United States, air traffic control developed three divisions. The first of several air mail radio stations (AMRS) was created in 1922, after World War I, when the U.S. Post Office began using techniques developed by the U.S. Army to direct and track the movements of reconnaissance aircraft. Over time, the AMRS morphed into flight service stations. Today's flight service stations do not issue control instructions, but provide pilots with many other flight related informational services. They do relay control instructions from ATC in areas where flight service is the only facility with radio or phone coverage. The first airport traffic control tower, regulating arrivals, departures, and surface movement of aircraft in the US at a specific airport, opened in Cleveland in 1930. Approach- and departure-control facilities were created after adoption of radar in the 1950s to monitor and control the busy airspace around larger airports. The first air route traffic control center (ARTCC), which directs the movement of aircraft between departure and destination, was opened in Newark in 1935, followed in 1936 by Chicago and Cleveland. \nAfter the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision, killing all 128 on board, the FAA was given the air-traffic responsibility in the United States in 1958, and this was followed by other countries. In 1960, Britain, France, Germany, and the Benelux countries set up Eurocontrol, intending to merge their airspaces. The first and only attempt to pool controllers between countries is the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC), founded in 1972 by Eurocontrol, and covering Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and north-western Germany. In 2001, the European Union (EU) aimed to create a 'Single European Sky', hoping to boost efficiency and gain economies of scale.\nIn the USSR, the first air traffic control service was organized in 1929 on the Moscow - Irkutsk air route; in 1930, control areas were defined along all existing air routes.\nAirport traffic control tower.\nThe primary method of controlling the immediate airport environment is visual observation from the airport control tower. The tower is typically a tall, windowed structure, located within the airport grounds. The air traffic controllers, usually abbreviated 'controller', are responsible for separation and efficient movement of aircraft and vehicles operating on the taxiways and runways of the airport itself, and aircraft in the air near the airport, generally , depending on the airport procedures. A controller must carry out the job using the precise and effective application of rules and procedures; however, they need flexible adjustments according to differing circumstances, often under time pressure. In a study which compared stress in the general population and among staff working in this kind of system, there was markedly showed more stress level for controllers. This variation can be explained, at least in part, by the characteristics of the job.\nRemote and virtual tower (RVT) is a system based on air traffic controllers being located somewhere other than at the local airport tower, and still able to provide air traffic control services.\nGround control.\nGround control (sometimes known as ground movement control, GMC) is responsible for the airport movement areas.\nSome busier airports have surface movement radar (SMR).\nAir control or local control.\nAir control (known to pilots as tower or tower control) is responsible for the active runway surfaces.\nFlight data and clearance delivery.\nClearance delivery is the position that issues route clearances to aircraft, typically before they commence taxiing. These clearances contain details of the route that the aircraft is expected to fly after departure.\nAnalogous use.\nIn the field of supply chain management, the concept of a \"supply chain control tower\" reflects the \"end-to-end visibility\" provided by an air traffic control tower. Ashutoch Gupta, writing for Gartner, observes that a supply chain control tower can be established \"by combining people, process, data, organization and technology to improve visibility, control and decision making\".\nApproach and terminal control.\nIn the U.S., TRACONs are additionally designated by a three-digit alphanumeric code. For example, the Chicago TRACON is designated C90.\nArea control centre / en-route centre.\nAn area control center, as opposed to a terminal control center, is a specific type of air traffic control center that primarily controls IFR traffic, or aircraft at high altitude flying by instruments, instead of aircraft that are landing or taking off. Each area control center is assigned a flight information region, and certain area control centers near the coast are also tasked with monitoring aircraft flying over the ocean. Area control centers perform similar duties to other types of air traffic control, such as rerouting aircraft to deal with adverse conditions and directing the course of aircraft to ensure separation.\nRadar coverage.\nIn the past, data on the position of aircraft were mainly determined by the following types of radar:\nIn addition to such types of radar, some air navigation service providers (e.g., Airservices Australia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Nav Canada, etc.) have implemented automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast (ADS-B) as part of their surveillance capability. This newer technology reverses the radar concept. Instead of radar 'finding' a target by interrogating the transponder, the ADS-B equipped aircraft 'broadcasts' a position report as determined by the navigation equipment on board the aircraft. ADS-C is another mode of automatic dependent surveillance, however ADS-C operates in the 'contract' mode, where the aircraft reports a position, automatically or initiated by the pilot, based on a predetermined time interval. It is also possible for controllers to request more frequent reports to more quickly establish aircraft position for specific reasons. However, since the cost for each report is charged by the ADS service providers to the company operating the aircraft, more frequent reports are not commonly requested, except in emergency situations. ADS-C is significant, because it can be used where it is not possible to locate the infrastructure for a radar system (e.g., over water). Operational display systems are now deployed and accept ADS-C inputs as part of their display.\nA radar archive system (RAS) keeps an electronic record of all radar information, preserving it for a few weeks. This information can be useful for search and rescue. When an aircraft has 'disappeared' from radar screens, a controller can review the last radar returns from the aircraft to determine its likely position. For an example, see the crash report in the following citation.\nProblems.\nTraffic.\nAir traffic control errors occur when the separation (either vertical or horizontal) between airborne aircraft falls below the minimum prescribed separation set (for the domestic United States) by the US Federal Aviation Administration. Separation minimums for terminal control areas (TCAs) around airports are lower than en-route standards. Errors generally occur during periods following times of intense activity, when controllers tend to relax and overlook the presence of traffic and conditions that lead to loss of minimum separation.\nWeather.\nAccording to the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), weather significantly impacts global aviation, with more than 70% of air traffic delays being attributed to adverse weather conditions. These disruptions cause widespread delays, rerouting by ATC, and cancellations across continents. In 2024, Europe experienced a 40% increase in weather-related en-route delays compared to 2023. As increasingly adverse weather intensifies the frequency and severity of these events, CANSO urged collaboration and real-time solutions among global aviation stakeholders to mitigate the effects of weather on flight operations.\nInfrastructure.\nGlobal ATC infrastructure is a complex network that varies significantly by region, with many countries facing challenges related to outdated technology, staffing shortages, and increasing traffic demand. While some regions, like parts of Europe and the U.S., have implemented modernization programs such as SESAR and NextGen, many others, especially in developing nations, still rely on legacy radar systems and voice-based communication, which limit efficiency and safety. These disparities contribute to delays and reduce the overall resilience of global air traffic management. According to the ICAO, coordinating ATC systems and accelerating digitalization is essential for meeting future aviation demands. Similarly, a 2024 report from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) emphasizes the urgency of investing in scalable, data-driven infrastructure to handle post-pandemic growth and ensure sustainability across the network.\nCongestion.\nConstrained control capacity and growing traffic lead to flight cancellation and delays. In America, delays caused by ATC grew by 69% between 2012 and 2017. ATC staffing issues were a major factor in congestion.Estimates suggest that more efficient ATC could save 5-10% of aviation fuel by avoiding holding patterns and indirect airways.\nAccordingly, the explanation of delays as resulting from ATC restrictions has become a common justification used by airlines to deny compensation claims. However, several European courts have determined that this rationale is sometimes applied incorrectly, with airlines attributing delays to ATC although all measures haven't been taken by the air carrier concerned to avoid the delays or cancellations.\nCall signs.\nA prerequisite to safe air traffic separation is the assignment and use of distinctive call signs. These are permanently allocated by ICAO on request, usually to scheduled flights, and some air forces and other military services for military flights. There are written call signs with a two or three\u00a0letter combination followed by the flight number such as AAL872 or VLG1011. As such, they appear on flight plans and ATC radar labels. There are also the \"audio\" or \"radio-telephony\" call signs used on the radio contact between pilots and air traffic control. These are not always identical to their written counterparts. An example of an audio call sign would be 'Speedbird 832', instead of the written 'BAW832'. This is used to reduce the chance of confusion between ATC and the aircraft. By default, the call sign for any other flight is the registration number (or tail number in US parlance) of the aircraft, such as 'N12345', 'C-GABC', or 'EC-IZD'. The short \"radio-telephony\" call signs for these tail numbers is the last three letters using the NATO phonetic alphabet (e.g. ABC, spoken \"alpha-bravo-charlie\" for C-GABC), or the last three numbers (e.g. \"three-four-five\" for N12345). In the United States, the prefix may be an aircraft type, model, or manufacturer in place of the first registration character, for example, 'N11842' could become 'Cessna 842'.\nTechnology.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has spent over US$3\u00a0billion on software, but a fully automated system is still yet to be achieved. In 2002, the United Kingdom commissioned a new area control center into service at the London Area Control Centre (LACC) at Swanwick in Hampshire, relieving a busy suburban centre at West Drayton in Middlesex, north of London Heathrow Airport. Software from Lockheed-Martin predominates at the London Area Control Centre. However, the centre was initially troubled by software and communications problems causing delays and occasional shutdowns.\nSome tools are available in different domains to help the controller further:\nProposed changes.\nIn the United States, some alterations to traffic control procedures are being examined:\nIn Europe, the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) programme plans to develop new methods, technologies, procedures, and systems to accommodate future (2020 and beyond) air traffic needs. In October 2018, European controller unions dismissed setting targets to improve ATC as \"a waste of time and effort\", as new technology could cut costs for users but threaten their jobs. In April 2019, the EU called for a 'Digital European Sky', focusing on cutting costs by including a common digitisation standard, and allowing controllers to move to where they are needed instead of merging national ATCs, as it would not solve all problems. Single air-traffic control services in continent-sized America and China does not alleviate congestion. Eurocontrol tries to reduce delays by diverting flights to less busy routes: flight paths across Europe were redesigned to accommodate the new airport in Istanbul, which opened in April, but the extra capacity will be absorbed by rising demand for air travel.\nWell-paid jobs in western Europe could move east with cheaper labour. The average Spanish controller earn over \u20ac200,000 a year, over seven times the country average salary, more than pilots, and at least ten controllers were paid over \u20ac810,000 ($1.1m) a year in 2010. French controllers spent a cumulative nine months on strike between 2004 and 2016.\nPrivatisation.\nMany countries have also privatised or corporatised their air navigation service providers. There are several models that can be used for ATC service providers. The first is to have the ATC services be part of a government agency as is currently the case in the United States. The problem with this model is that funding can be inconsistent, and can disrupt the development and operation of services. Sometimes funding can disappear when lawmakers cannot approve budgets in time. Both proponents and opponents of privatisation recognise that stable funding is one of the major factors for successful upgrades of ATC infrastructure. Some of the funding issues include sequestration and politicisation of projects. Proponents argue that moving ATC services to a private corporation could stabilise funding over the long term which will result in more predictable planning and rollout of new technology as well as training of personnel. As of November 2024, The United States had 265 contractor towers that are staffed by private companies but administered by FAA through its FAA Contract Tower Program, which was established in 1982. These contract control towers cover 51% of all the Federal air traffic control towers in the U.S.\nAnother model is to have ATC services provided by a government corporation. This model is used in Germany, where funding is obtained through user fees. Yet another model is to have a for-profit corporation operate ATC services. This is the model used in the United Kingdom, but there have been several issues with the system there, including a large-scale failure in December 2014 which caused delays and cancellations and has been attributed to cost-cutting measures put in place by this corporation. In fact, earlier that year, the corporation owned by the German government won the bid to provide ATC services for Gatwick Airport in the United Kingdom. The last model, which is often the suggested model for the United States to transition to is to have a non-profit organisation that would handle ATC services as is used in Canada.\nThe Canadian system is the one most often used as a model by proponents of privatisation. Air traffic control privatisation has been successful in Canada with the creation of Nav Canada, a private non-profit organisation which has reduced costs, and has allowed new technologies to be deployed faster due to the elimination of much of the bureaucratic red tape. This has resulted in shorter flights and less fuel usage. It has also resulted in flights being safer due to new technology. Nav Canada is funded from fees that are collected from the airlines based on the weight of the aircraft and the distance flown.\nAir traffic control is operated by national governments with few exceptions: in the European Union, only Italy has private shareholders. Privatisation does not guarantee lower prices: the profit margin of MUAC was 70% in 2017, as there is no competition, but governments could offer fixed terms concessions. \nATC regulations in the United States.\nThe United States airspace is divided into 21 zones (centres), and each zone is divided into sectors. Also within each zone are portions of airspace, about in diameter, called TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control) airspaces. Within each TRACON airspace are a number of airports, each of which has its own airspace with a radius. FAA control tower operators (CTO) / air traffic controllers use FAA Order 7110.65 as the authority for all procedures regarding air traffic.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48566", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48566", "title": "Ecovillage", "text": "Community with the goal of becoming more sustainable\nAn ecovillage is a traditional or intentional community that aims to become more socially, culturally, economically and/or environmentally sustainable. An ecovillage strives to have the least possible negative impact on the natural environment through the intentional physical design and behavioural choices of its inhabitants. It is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate and restore its social and natural environments. Most range from a population of 50 to 250 individuals, although some are smaller, and traditional ecovillages are often much larger. Larger ecovillages often exist as networks of smaller sub-communities. Some ecovillages have grown through like-minded individuals, families, or other small groups\u2014who are not members, at least at the outset\u2014settling on the ecovillage's periphery and participating \"de facto\" in the community. There are currently more than 10,000 ecovillages around the world.\nEcovillagers are united by shared ecological, social-economic and cultural-spiritual values. Concretely, ecovillagers seek alternatives to ecologically destructive electrical, water, transportation, and waste-treatment systems, as well as the larger social systems that mirror and support them. Many see the breakdown of traditional forms of community, wasteful consumerist lifestyles, the destruction of natural habitat, urban sprawl, factory farming, and over-reliance on fossil fuels as trends that must be changed to avert ecological disaster and create richer and more fulfilling ways of life.\nEcovillages offer small-scale communities with minimal ecological impact or regenerative impacts as an alternative. However, such communities often cooperate with peer villages in networks of their own (\"see\" Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) for an example). This model of collective action is similar to that of Ten Thousand Villages, which supports the fair trade of goods worldwide.\nThe concept of the ecovillage has undergone significant development over time, as evidenced by the remarkable growth and evolution of these communities over the past few decades. The various facets of the ecovillage include case studies of community models, discussions on sustainability alignment for diverse needs, examinations of their environmental impact, explorations of governance structures, and considerations of the challenges faced on their path towards a successful ecovillage.\nDefinition.\nMultiple sources define ecovillages as a subtype of intentional communities focusing on sustainability. More pronounced definitions are listed here:\nIn Joubert's view, ecovillages are seen as an ongoing process, rather than a particular outcome. They often start off with a focus on one of the four dimensions of sustainability, e.g. ecology, but evolve into holistic models for restoration. In this view, aiming for sustainability is not enough; it is vital to restore and regenerate the fabric of life and across all four dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental, economic and cultural.\nEcovillages have developed in recent years as technology has improved, so they have more sophisticated structures as noted by Baydoun, M. 2013.\nGenerally, the ecovillage concept is not tied to specific sectarian (religious, political, corporate) organizations or belief systems not directly related to environmentalism, such as monasteries, cults, or communes.\nHistory.\nThe modern-day desire for community was notably characterized by the communal \"back to the land\" movement of the 1960s and 1970s through communities such as the earliest example that still survives, the Miccosukee Land Co-op co-founded in May 1973 by James Clement van Pelt in Tallahassee, Florida. In the same decades, the imperative for alternatives to radically inefficient energy-use patterns, in particular automobile-enabled suburban sprawl, was brought into focus by recurrent energy crises. The term \"eco-village\" was introduced by Georgia Tech Professor George Ramsey in a 1978 address, \"Passive Energy Applications for the Built Environment\", to the First World Energy Conference of the Association of Energy Engineers, to describe small-scale, car-free, close-in developments, including suburban infill, arguing that \"the great energy waste in the United States is not in its technology; it is in its lifestyle and concept of living.\" Ramsey's article includes a sketch for a \"self-sufficient pedestrian solar village\" by one of his students that looks very similar to eco-villages today.\nThe movement became more focused and organized in the cohousing and related alternative-community movements of the mid-1980s. Then, in 1991, Robert Gilman and Diane Gilman co-authored a germinal study called \"Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities\" for Gaia Trust, in which the ecological and communitarian themes were brought together.\nThe first ecovillage in North America began its first stages in 1990. Earthaven Ecovillage near Ashville in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina was the first community called an ecovillage and was designed using permaculture (holistic) principles. The first residents moved onto the vacant land in 1994. As of 2025 Earthaven Ecovillage has over 75 adults and 25 children living off the grid on 329 acres of land.\nThe ecovillage movement began to coalesce at the annual autumn conference of Findhorn, in Scotland, in 1995. The conference was called: \"Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities\", and conference organizers turned away hundreds of applicants. According to Ross Jackson, \"somehow they had struck a chord that resonated far and wide. The word 'ecovillage'... thus became part of the language of the Cultural Creatives.\" After that conference, many intentional communities, including Findhorn, began calling themselves \"ecovillages\", giving birth to a new movement. The Global Ecovillage Network, formed by a group of about 25 people from various countries who had attended the Findhorn conference, crystallized the event by linking hundreds of small projects from around the world, that had similar goals but had formerly operated without knowledge of each other. Gaia Trust of Denmark agreed to fund the network for its first five years.\nSince the 1995 conference, a number of the early members of the Global Ecovillage Network have tried other approaches to ecovillage building in an attempt to build settlements that would be attractive to mainstream culture in order to make sustainable development more generally accepted. One of these with some degree of success is Living Villages and The Wintles where eco-houses are arranged so that social connectivity is maximized and residents have shared food growing areas, woodlands, and animal husbandry for greater sustainability.\nThe most recent worldwide update emerges from the 2025 Annual Report of GEN International, detailing the mapping of 1,251 ecovillage communities on GEN's interactive ecovillage map. GEN collaborated closely with a diverse array of researchers and ecovillage communities spanning the globe to develop the Ecovillage Impact Assessment. Their innovative tool serves as a means for communities, groups, and individuals to accurately report, chart, evaluate, and present their efforts toward fostering participatory cultural, social, ecological, and economic regeneration. Over the course of three years, from February 2021 to April 2024, data from 140 surveys conducted within 75 ecovillages formed the basis of the comprehensive results. Through this assessment ecovillages are empowered to understand their impact and influence their community has had.\nSustainability alignment.\nEcovillages are defined by their commitment sustainability through a multitude of design, lifestyle, and community objectives. They prioritize environmental stewardship through various methods, including the utilization of renewable energy sources, the minimization of waste through recycling and composting, and the practice of organic agriculture and permaculture. In many cases, these communities strive for self-sufficiency in food production, with the aim of reducing the ecological footprint associated with food transportation. Ecovillage communities place a strong emphasis on the conservation of resources through the application of green building techniques, including passive solar design, natural insulation, and rainwater harvesting. Additionally, they promote alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling and walking, as a means of reducing reliance on fossil fuels. \nThe objective of ecovillages is to cultivate robust social connections and a sense of belonging among residents through the promotion of collaboration, consensus-based decision-making, and shared responsibilities. This approach fosters a supportive environment that enhances both individual and collective resilience. Ecovillages represent an international phenomenon that encompasses cultural diversity, frequently integrating traditional wisdom alongside innovative practices. Many ecovillages espouse multiculturalism, indigenous knowledge, and participation as means of enhancing intergenerational learning. \nIn essence, these communities endeavor to achieve sustainable living through a multitude of diverse efforts, offering valuable insight into the creation of a sustainable relationship between humanity and the natural world. In essence, these communities aim for sustainable living through a multitude of various efforts and offer valuable insight for creating a sustainable relationship between humanity and the natural world.\nBetween November 2021 and May 2024 twenty ecovillages took part in a participatory research study to examine and assess the ways their communities demonstrate and nurture resilience in the face of the coming 2.5 degree climate change scenario. The report makes recommendations for action over the next fifteen years.\nEnvironmental impact.\nThe formation of ecovillages is frequently driven by a concern for environmental stewardship and a commitment to sustainable practices. Ecovillages frequently employ renewable power sources, such as solar and wind energy, and utilize natural materials, including mud, wood, and straw, in their construction. Such technologies as bioclimatic agriculture are employed in this regard.\nA study on an ecovillage in Ithaca, New York found that the average ecological footprint of a resident in the ecovillage was 70% less than the ecological footprint of most Americans. Ecovillage residents seek a sustainable lifestyle (for example, of voluntary simplicity) for inhabitants with a minimum of trade outside the local area, or ecoregion. Many seek independence from existing infrastructures, although others, particularly in more urban settings, pursue more integration with existing infrastructure. Rural ecovillages are usually based on organic farming, permaculture and other approaches which promote ecosystem function and biodiversity. Ecovillages, whether urban or rural, tend to integrate community and ecological values within a principle-based approach to sustainability, such as permaculture design. In 2019, a study assessed the impact of community sustainability through a life cycle assessment conducted on three ecovillages. The results of this study revealed a substantial reduction in carbon emissions among residents of these ecovillages when compared to the average United States citizen. This study reported that residents had a 63% to 71% decrease in carbon emissions due to living in an ecovillage with sustainable practices and mitigation efforts to environmental impact.\nGovernance.\nEcovillages, while united by their commitment to sustainability and communal living, often differ in their approaches to governance. Every ecovillage strives to reflect the diverse needs and values of their communities. Ultimately, the choice of governance model within ecovillages aims to demonstrates a balance between fostering community cohesion, promoting sustainability, and accommodating the varied needs and values of their members.\nEstablishing governance is a common method used by ecovillages to align individual actions with community objectives. Most ecovillages maintain a distinct set of policies to govern aspects of what keeps their society functioning. Policies within ecovillages are meant to evolve with new situations prompting revisions to existing guidelines. Ecovillages commonly incorporate elements of consensus decision-making into their governance processes. This approach aims to mitigate hierarchies, power imbalances, and inflexibility within their governments. The governmental framework designed in the Ecovillage Tamera, Portugal promotes inclusivity that actively works to combat hierarchical structures. The Tamera community attributes their success to their Women's Council who confront patriarchal norms and empower women within the governance system. Members of ecovillage communities will select their peers to serve as government members based on established trust within the community, this serves as an active strategy to mitigate the emergence of hierarchies. Through involvement of community members in reviewing and revising existing rules, ecovillages ensure flexibility and adaptability to evolving needs. Active participation in policy formulation fosters a sense of ownership among members regarding community expectations and boundaries. Ecovillage community members express their contentment knowing they had the opportunity to voice their concerns and contribute to the decision-making process.\nEach ecovillage exhibits a unique approach to how they will develop their governance. Ecovillages acknowledge that there is a delicate balance in maintaining a functioning community that appreciates and considers the perspectives of its members. Through active involvement in the governance processes, ecovillages demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity, adaptability, and collective empowerment, demonstrating the principles of collaborative decision-making and community-driven change.\nChallenges.\nWhile ecovillages aim to embody admirable dimensions of sustainability and community, they are not without their challenges. One significant challenge is the initial investment required to establish or transition to an ecovillage lifestyle. The costs of acquiring land, implementing sustainable infrastructure, and maintaining communal facilities can be prohibitive for some individuals or groups making available funds a limiting factor. Conflicts can arise regarding community rules, resource allocation, or individual responsibilities, it can be difficult to maintain cohesion which can be expected in any community type. An explorative study results concluded that the perceived quality of life of residents in eco-developments rated higher perceived quality of life than residents of developments in conventional settings while still noting various challenges they experienced. Another noteworthy challenge can be limited access to resources, like land that is adequate for agriculture, available water or renewable energy potential which can limit the viability of ecovillage initiatives.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKellogg, W.

He was a member of twelve cabinets and represented five political parties in a political career spanning 70 years. Peres was elected to the Knesset in November 1959 and except for three months out of office in early 2006, served as a member of the Knesset continuously until he was elected president in 2007. Serving in the Knesset for 48 years (with the first uninterrupted stretch lasting more than 46 years), Peres is the longest serving member in the Knesset's history. At the time of his retirement from politics in 2014, he was the world's oldest head of state and was considered the last link to Israel's founding generation, as well as the last Prime Minister to make aliyah rather than being born on territory that would become Israel.\nFrom a young age, he was renowned for his oratorical brilliance, and was chosen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 by David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founding father. He began his political career in the late 1940s, holding several diplomatic and military positions during and directly after the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. His first high-level government position was as deputy director general of defense in 1952 which he attained at the age of 28, and director general from 1953 until 1959. In 1956, he took part in the historic negotiations on the Protocol of S\u00e8vres, which was described by British prime minister Anthony Eden as the \"highest form of statesmanship\". In 1963, he held negotiations with U.S. president John F. Kennedy, which resulted in the sale of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Israel, the first sale of U.S. military equipment to Israel. Peres represented Mapai, Rafi, the Alignment, Labor and Kadima in the Knesset, and led Alignment and Labor.\nPeres first succeeded Yitzhak Rabin as acting prime minister briefly during 1977, before becoming prime minister from 1984 to 1986. As foreign minister under Prime Minister Rabin, Peres engineered the 1994 Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty, and won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize together with Rabin and Yasser Arafat for the Oslo Accords peace talks with the Palestinian leadership. In 1996, he founded the Peres Center for Peace, which has the aim of \"promot[ing] lasting peace and advancement in the Middle East by fostering tolerance, economic and technological development, cooperation and well-being.\" After suffering a stroke, Peres died in 2016 near Tel Aviv.\nEarly life.\nShimon Peres was born Szymon Perski, on 2 August 1923, in Wiszniew, Poland (now Vishnyeva, Belarus), to Yitzhak (1896\u20131962) and Sara (1905\u20131969, n\u00e9e Meltzer) Perski. The family spoke Hebrew, Yiddish and Russian at home, and Peres learned Polish at school. He then learned to speak English and French. His father was a wealthy timber merchant, later branching out into other commodities; his mother was a librarian. Peres had a younger brother, Gershon. He was related to the American film star Lauren Bacall (born Betty Joan Perske), and they were described as first cousins, but Peres said, \"In 1952 or 1953, I came to New York\u00a0... Lauren Bacall called me, said that she wanted to meet, and we did. We sat and talked about where our families came from, and discovered that we were from the same family\u00a0... but I'm not exactly sure what our relation is\u00a0... It was she who later said that she was my cousin; I didn't say that\".\nPeres told Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson that he had been born as a result of a blessing his parents had received from a chassidic rebbe and that he was proud of it. Peres's grandfather, Rabbi Zvi Meltzer, a grandson of Rabbi Chaim Volozhin, had a great impact on his life. In an interview, Peres said: \"As a child, I grew up in my grandfather's home. \u2026 I was educated by him. \u2026 My grandfather taught me Talmud. It was not as easy as it sounds. My home was not an observant one. My parents were not Orthodox but I was Haredi. At one point, I heard my parents listening to the radio on the Sabbath and I smashed it.\" When he was a child, Peres was taken by his father to Radun to receive a blessing from Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (known as \"the \"Chofetz Chaim\"\"). As a child, Peres would later say, \"I did not dream of becoming president of Israel. My dream as a boy was to be a shepherd or a poet of stars.\" He inherited his love of French literature from his maternal grandfather.\nIn 1932, Peres's father immigrated to Mandatory Palestine and settled in Tel Aviv. The family followed him in 1934. He attended Balfour Elementary School and High School, and Geula Gymnasium (High School for Commerce) in Tel Aviv. At 15, he transferred to Ben Shemen agricultural school and lived on Kibbutz Geva for several years. Peres was one of the founders of Kibbutz Alumot.\nIn 1941, he was elected Secretary of HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed, a Labor Zionist youth movement, and in 1944 returned to Alumot, where he had an agricultural training and worked as a farmer and a shepherd.\nAt age 20, he was elected to the HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed national secretariat, where he was only one of two Mapai party supporters, out of the 12 members. Three years later, he took over the movement and won a majority. The head of Mapai, David Ben-Gurion, and Berl Katznelson began to take an interest in him, and appointed him to Mapai's secretariat.\nIn 1944, Peres led an illicit expedition into the Negev, then a closed military zone requiring a permit to enter. The expedition, consisting of a group of teenagers, along with a Palmach scout, a zoologist, and an archaeologist, had been funded by Ben-Gurion and planned by Palmach head Yitzhak Sadeh, as part of a plan for future Jewish settlement of the area so as to include it in the Jewish state. The group was arrested by a Bedouin camel patrol led by a British officer, taken to Beersheba (then a small Arab town) and incarcerated in the local jail. All of the participants were sentenced to two weeks in prison, and as the leader, Peres was also heavily fined. The expedition came across a nest of bearded vultures, called \"peres\" in Hebrew, and from this Peres took his Hebrew name.\nAll of Peres's relatives who remained in Wiszniew in 1941 were murdered during the Holocaust, many of them (including Rabbi Meltzer) burned alive in the town's synagogue.\nIn 1945, Peres married Sonya Gelman, who preferred to remain outside the public eye. They had three children.\nIn 1946, Peres and Moshe Dayan were chosen as the two youth delegates in the Mapai delegation to the Zionist Congress in Basel.\nIn 1947, Peres joined the Haganah, the predecessor of the Israel Defense Forces. David Ben-Gurion made him responsible for personnel and arms purchases; he was appointed to head the naval service when Israel received independence in 1948.\nPeres was director of the Defense Ministry's delegation in the United States in the early 1950s. While in the U.S. he studied English, economics, and philosophy at The New School and New York University, and completed a four-month advanced management course at Harvard University.\nDirector General of Defense (1953\u20131959).\nIn 1952, Peres was appointed deputy director general of the Ministry of Defense, and the following year, he was promoted to director general. At age 29, he was the youngest person to hold this position. He was involved in arms purchases and establishing strategic alliances that were important for the State of Israel. He was instrumental in establishing close relations with France, securing massive amounts of quality arms that, in turn, helped to tip the balance of power in the region.\nIn 1955, he testified against Minister of Defense Pinhas Lavon in what became known as the Lavon Affair.\nOwing to Peres's mediation, Israel acquired the advanced Dassault Mirage III French jet fighter, established the Dimona nuclear reactor and entered into a tri-national agreement with France and the United Kingdom, positioning Israel in what would become the 1956 Suez Crisis. Peres continued as a primary intermediary in the close French-Israeli alliance from the mid-1950s, although from 1958, he was often involved in tense negotiations with Charles de Gaulle over the Dimona project.\nPeres is considered to have been the architect of Israel's secret nuclear weapons program in the 1960s, and he stated that, in the 1960s, he recruited Arnon Milchan, an Israeli-American Hollywood film producer, billionaire businessman, and secret arms dealer and intelligence operative, to work for the Israeli Bureau of Scientific Relations (LEKEM or LAKAM), a secret intelligence organization tasked with obtaining military technology and science espionage.\n1956 Suez Crisis.\nFrom 1954, as director general of the Ministry of Defense, Peres was involved in the planning of the 1956 Suez War, in partnership with France and Britain. Peres was sent by David Ben-Gurion to Paris, where he held secret meetings with the French government. Peres was instrumental in negotiating the Franco-Israeli agreement for a military offensive. In November 1954, Peres visited Paris, where he was received by the French defense minister Marie-Pierre K\u0153nig, who told him that France would sell Israel any weapons it wanted to buy. By early 1955, France was shipping large amounts of weapons to Israel. In April 1956, following another visit to Paris by Peres, France agreed to disregard the Tripartite Declaration, and supply more weapons to Israel. During the same visit, Peres informed the French that Israel had decided upon war with Egypt in 1956. Throughout the 1950s, an extraordinarily close relationship existed between France and Israel, characterised by unprecedented cooperation in the fields of defense and diplomacy. For his work as the architect of this relationship, Peres was awarded the highest order of the French, the Legion of Honor, as Commander.\nAt S\u00e8vres, Peres took part in planning alongside Maurice Bourg\u00e8s-Maunoury, Christian Pineau and Chief of Staff of the French Armed Forces General Maurice Challe, and British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd and his assistant Sir Patrick Dean. Britain and France enlisted Israeli support for an alliance against Egypt. The parties agreed that Israel would invade the Sinai. Britain and France would then intervene, purportedly to separate the warring Israeli and Egyptian forces, instructing both to withdraw to a distance of 16 kilometres from either side of the canal. The British and French would then argue, according to the plan, that Egypt's control of such an important route was too tenuous, and that it needed be placed under Anglo-French management. The agreement at S\u00e8vres was initially described by British prime minister Anthony Eden as the \"highest form of statesmanship\". The three allies, especially Israel, were mainly successful in attaining their immediate military objectives. However, the extremely hostile reaction to the Suez Crisis from both the United States and the USSR forced them to withdraw, resulting in a failure of Britain and France's political and strategic aims of controlling the Suez Canal.\nEarly Knesset career (1959\u20131974).\nPeres was first elected to the Knesset in the 1959 elections as a member of the Mapai party. He was given the role of deputy minister of defense, which he filled until 1965 (holding this position in the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th governments of Israel under Prime Ministers David Ben-Gurion and Levi Eshkol). In this position, he held negotiations with John F. Kennedy, which concluded with the sale of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Israel, the first sale of US military equipment to Israel. Peres expressed great appreciation and praise for the American decision to sell Hawk missiles in a speech to the Knesset on 25 June 1963.\nPeres resigned from the 12th government in late May 1965, citing the growing rift between Prime Minister Eshkol and former prime minister Ben-Gurion (Peres was aligned with Ben Gurion). In 1965, Peres and Moshe Dayan were among those that left Mapai with David Ben-Gurion when Ben-Gurion formed a new party, Rafi. Peres was a co-founder of the Rafi party. The party reconciled with Mapai in 1968, merging to form the Israeli Labor Party. The Labor Party then joined the Alignment (a left-wing alliance).\nIn 1969, Peres was appointed minister of immigrant absorption in the 15th government (led by Prime Minister Golda Meir), and in 1970 (also in the 15th government), he became minister of transportation and communications. After this, he served as minister of information in the Meir-led 16th government.\nMinister of Defense (1974\u20131977).\nPeres was appointed minister of defense in the Yitzhak Rabin-led 17th government, after having been Rabin's chief rival for the post of Labor Party leader (and, in effect, the Israeli premiership) in the 1974 Israeli Labor Party leadership election that was held after Golda Meir resigned in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War.\n1976 Entebbe rescue operation.\nOn 27 June 1976, Peres, as minister of defense, in collaboration with Prime Minister Rabin, handled Israel's response to a coordinated act of terrorism when 248 Paris-bound travelers on an Air France plane were taken hostage by pro-Palestinian hijackers and flown to Uganda, Africa, 2,000 miles away.\nPeres and Rabin were responsible for approving what became known as the \"Operation Entebbe\", which took place on 4 July 1976. The rescue boosted the Rabin government's approval rating with the public. The only Israeli soldier that was killed during the successful rescue operation was its commander, 30-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Netanyahu, older brother of Benjamin Netanyahu.\nBefore Rabin ultimately approved the rescue mission, he and Peres were at odds on how to proceed. Rabin was open to acquiescing to the terrorists' demands to release forty Palestinian militants if no military option presented itself. Peres, however, felt acquiescing to be a nonstarter, believing it would encourage further terrorism. Rabin initially took steps to begin negotiations with the terrorists, seeing no other option. Peres felt that negotiating with terrorists would, in effect, be a surrender, and thought a rescue operation should be planned.\nPeres organized a secret Israel Crisis Committee to come up with a rescue plan. When a plan had been made, he met with commander Netanyahu a number of times. During one of their final private meetings, they both examined maps and went over precise details. Peres later said of Netanyahu's explanation, \"My impression was one of exactitude and imagination,\" saying that Netanyahu seemed confident the operation would succeed with almost no losses. Netanyahu left the meeting understanding that Peres would do everything in his power to see that the operation went smoothly. Peres then went unannounced to Moshe Dayan, the former minister of Defense, interrupting his dinner with friends in a restaurant, to show him the latest plan to get his opinion. Peres told Dayan of the objections that had been raised by Rabin and chief of staff, Mordechai Gur. Dayan dismissed the objections after reviewing the written details: \"Shimon,\" he said, \"this is a plan that I support not one hundred percent but one hundred and fifty percent! There has to be a military operation.\" Peres later got the approval from Gur, who became fully supportive. Peres then took the plan to Rabin, who had been lukewarm and still didn't like the risks, but he reluctantly approved the plan after Peres answered a number of key questions and Rabin learned that the cabinet had also endorsed it.\nShortly after the mission ended, Rabin recounted, \"we called into my office seven of our top commanders...I told our friends in uniform that the honor of the Jewish people, their destinies, are challenged and what we are considering is not just a calculated risk in the military sense, but a comparative risk, which exists between surrender to terror and daring rescue stemming from independence.\"\nAfter the success of the operation, Peres angled to receive some of the credit and adulation, somewhat competing with Rabin for credit.\nUnsuccessful February 1977 campaign for Labor Party leader.\nIn February 1977, Peres challenged Prime Minister Rabin for the leadership of Labor Party, but lost to Rabin in a narrow 50.72% to 49.28% result in the vote by the party's Central Committee. The leadership election was expected to determine who would lead the party into the 1977 Knesset election. This was at moment when Labor was threatened with the prospect of losing its control of government after 28-consecutive years due to the rise of both the right-wing Likud bloc and the centrist Democratic Movement for Change, which were seen as collectively cutting into the Labor Party's support in the upcoming election. At the time, Rabin and Peres presented little policy difference, with Peres being seen as only slightly to the right of Rabin on domestic matters. Instead of positioning himself in contrast to the incumbent Rabin on policy, Peres instead capitalized off of the political atmosphere and staked his candidacy largely on an argument that the Labor Party needed to satisfy the nation's desire for change by choosing a new leader for itself.\nUnofficial acting premiership (1977).\nOn 7 April 1977, Prime Minister Rabin announced that, in the wake of a foreign currency scandal involving his wife, he would be stepping down prior to the 1977 Knesset election. Peres made himself a candidate to replace him as the new Labor Party leader. Initially, Foreign Minister Yigal Allon also made himself a candidate. However, Allon and Peres reached an agreement that Peres would appoint Allon to any ministerial position that Allon preferred in exchange from his withdrawal of his candidacy. Following Allon's withdrawal, the Labor Party leadership announced on 10 April 1977 that he had chosen to endorse Peres as the party's new leader. On 11 April 1977, the 815-member Central Committee of the party elected Peres by acclamation as the party's new leader.\nRabin ended his active service as prime minister on 22 April 1977, and Peres became Israel's unofficial acting prime minister. The reason why Peres was not officially the holder of this office was that Rabin could not, under Israeli law, resign from his position as prime minister because the government was, at the time, a caretaker government.\nIn his first election as party leader, Peres led Labor Party and the Alignment coalition to its first ever electoral defeat, and the result afforded the first-place Likud party (led by Menachem Begin) the ability to form a coalition that excluded the left. When the new Likud-led government was formed on 20 June 1977 Peres' time as the unofficial acting prime minister ended.\nLabor in opposition (1977\u20131984).\nOnce the Likud-led government took power, Labor and the Alignment bloc entered the Knesset opposition for the first time in its history, and Peres assumed the unofficial role of Knesset opposition leader.\nIn 1978, Peres was elected vice president of Socialist International. Through his role within the leadership of this organization, Peres befriended foreign politicians including Willy Brandt, Bruno Kreisky, members of the British Labour Party, and politicians from parts of Africa and Asia.\nAfter handily winning reelection as Labor Party leader in 1980 (defeating a challenge from Rabin, who was attempting a comeback to the leadership), Peres led his party to another, narrower, loss in the 1981 elections.\nGrand coalition governments and first premiership (1984\u20131988).\nIn the 1984 elections (Peres' third election as Labor Party leader), the Alignment coalition won more seats than any other party, but the left-wing failed to win the majority of 61 seats needed to form a coalition on their own. Alignment and Likud agreed to an unusual \"rotation\" arrangement to form a grand coalition unity government during which, for the first twenty-five months, Peres would serve as prime minister and the Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir would be foreign minister, with the two swapping positions thereafter for the second half of the term.\nFirst premiership (1984\u20131986).\nPeres was regarded to be a popular prime minister in his two years as premier under the rotation arrangement. During a portion of his premiership, he also held the position of minister of religious affairs.\nMilitary policy and international relations.\nAmong the most noteworthy moments of his first tenure as prime minister was Operation Wooden Leg (a long-range Israeli airstrike against the PLO headquarters in Tunisia) and a trip to Morocco to confer with King Hassan II.\nIn 1985, Peres publicly supported the quick pursuit of a military pullback from Beirut to Israel's south Lebanon security belt. A partial Israeli pullback had earlier been approved in 1983 by the Begin-headed Likud-led government that had been in power at that time.\n1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan.\nA major domestic policy decision of Peres' first premiership was the implementation of the 1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan.\nBy 1985, Israel's economic fortunes were looking dire, with immense and quickly rising inflation (Israel was experiencing hyperinflation), a government budget deficit equal to between twelve and fifteen percent of the nation's GDP and national debt equal to 220% of the nation's GDP, and Israel's foreign currency reserves were quickly dissipating. With the assistance of the government of the United States, Peres assembled a board of American economist to advise him on the situation. Conditional on him implementing reforms, Peres secured emergency economic assistance from the United States of $750 million (equivalent to 3.5% of the nation's GDP at the time) annually over a two-year period.\nPeres was initially hesitant to take the drastic measures that he ultimately would pursue, as they had the strong potential of proving unpopular and came with a risk of potentially creating a drastic increase in unemployment. Peres ultimately was convinced to push through the 1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan. Once convinced, he was assertive in pushing for the passage of the program, which was quickly after approved by his cabinet on 1 July 1985. This program had quick success in improving the course of the Israeli economy. By the end of the year, inflation immensely decreased. Additionally, the shekel stabilized and the government balanced its budget. While Israel would subsequently slide into a recession, the stabilization has been regarded as an important and greatly successful model for addressing economies in crisis, and has been credited with saving the nation's economy.\nMinister of Foreign Affairs (1986\u20131988).\nAs per the rotation arrangement, after Peres' two years as prime minister he and Shamir traded places in 1986. Shamir became prime minister of the new twenty-second government of Israel and Peres became foreign minister as well as the designated acting prime minister of Israel.\nMinister of Finance (1988\u20131990).\nIn 1988 the Alignment, led by Peres, suffered another narrow defeat. This came despite the fact that polling in 1988 showed Peres to be the most popular politician in the nation. Peres agreed to renew the grand coalition with the Likud, this time conceding the premiership to Shamir for the entire term. In the grand coalition unity government of 1988\u201390 (the twenty-third government of Israel), Peres served as minister of finance and also continued to be the designated acting prime minister of Israel.\nReturn to opposition (1990\u20131992).\n\"The dirty trick\".\nPeres and the Alignment finally left the government in 1990, after \"the dirty trick\" \u2013 a failed bid by Peres to form a narrow government based on a coalition of the Alignment, small leftist factions and ultra-orthodox parties. Peres' hope had been to create a Labor-led government that would be focused on peace talks with Palestine. Likud had declined proposals by the United States for Israel and Palestine to initiate what would have been the first peace talks between the two sides. Peres' longtime intra-party rival, Yizhak Rabin, had opposed to overthrowing the Likud-led coalition government. Peres succeeded in ending the government twenty-third government with a vote of no confidence. However, Peres was subsequently unable to assemble enough Knesset partners to form a pro-peace talk government. After two months, Shamir managed to form a Likud-led government with right-wing religious parties, establishing what was seen as the most conservative government coalition in the history of Israel up to that point.\nDefeat in the 1992 Labor Party leadership election.\nPeres led the opposition in the Knesset from 1990 until early 1992, when he was defeated by Yitzhak Rabin in the Israeli Labor Party leadership election, the first leadership election held since the party formally merged with the other parties of Alignment, and the first leadership election open to participation by the party's entire membership. Peres remained active in politics, however.\nRabin government (1992\u20131995).\nAfter the Labor Party was successful in the 1992 Knesset election and Rabin became prime minister again, Peres became foreign minister in the Rabin-led twenty-fifth government of Israel. Peres had previously served as foreign minister from 1986 through 1988.\nIsrael\u2013Jordan peace treaty.\nOn 26 October 1994, Jordan and Israel signed the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty, which had been initiated by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. The ceremony was held in the Arava valley of Israel, north of Eilat and near the Jordanian border. Prime Minister Rabin and Prime Minister Abdelsalam al-Majali signed the treaty and the president of Israel Ezer Weizman shook hands with King Hussein. United States president Bill Clinton observed, accompanied by United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher, as well as the foreign ministers of eleven other nations (including Russia, which had joined the United States as a formal co-sponsor of the peace talks that led to the treaty). The treaty brought an end to 46 years of official war between Israel and Jordan. It was only the second full peace agreement that Israel had reached with an Arab nation, after the Camp David Accords signed with Egypt in 1978.\nOslo peace process with Palestine.\nRabin's 1992 campaign for Labor had primarily been run on the idea of negotiating peace with the Palestinians. This campaign had succeeded as a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was popular among the Israeli public at the time. The twenty-fifth government of Israel was arguably more pro-peace government than any previous Israeli government. It would begin negotiations with the Yasser Arafat-led Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nPeres was involved in secret peace negotiations between Prime Minister Rabin's government and Arafat's PLO organization. These negotiations were held over several months in 1992 and 1993. As part of the negotiations, Peres secretly flew to Oslo, Norway on 19 August 1993. The ultimate agreement outlined a peace process between Israel and Palestine, which would include the establishment of an interim Palestinian government within both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. On 13 September 1993, Peres signed the initial Oslo I Accord on behalf of the Israeli government in a ceremony at the United States' White House, with Rabin in attendance.\nIn 1994, in recognition of the Oslo Accords, Peres, Rabin and Arafat were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This was the second (and most recent) instance in which an Israeli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin had previously jointly received the honor with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1978. This was also the second time that the award had been given in recognition of middle east peacemaking efforts, with the 1978 award having been the previous instance of this. The awarding of the prize to the three has not been without controversy. After it was decided they would be given the award, K\u00e5re Kristiansen resigned from the Nobel Peace Prize committee in protest of Arafat receiving the award, believing Arafat to be, \"too tainted by violence, terror and torture\". In 2002, a number of members of the Norwegian committee that awards the annual Nobel Peace Prize would state they regretted that Mr. Peres's prize could not be recalled. Because he had not acted to prevent Israel's re-occupation of Palestinian territory, he had not lived up to the ideals he expressed when he accepted the prize, and he was involved in human rights abuses.\nNegotiations on further terms continued, with Peres continuing to be an integral player. On 28 September 1995, Rabin and Arafat jointly signed a second major agreement, which has popularly been referred to as \"Oslo II\".\nSecond premiership (1995\u20131996).\nWhile the Oslo peace policies, at the time, enjoyed the support of most Israelis, they also faced intense opposition from extreme members of Israel's right-wing. In response to intense street protests by right-wing opponents of the Oslo peace process, a coalition of left-wing parties and peace groups organized a rally in support of the peace process in Tel Aviv's Kings Square on 4 November 1995, which both Prime Minister Rabin and Peres attended. While making his way from the stage to his car after concluding his speech to the gathered crowd of more than 100,000 people, Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a right-wing Israeli Jew who opposed the peace process.\nAfter Rabin's assassination, Peres was made acting prime minister and acting defense minister of a provisional government. On 14 November 1995, the Labor Party confirmed Peres as its new leader, which thereby cleared the last formality before he could be invited by President Ezer Weizman to form a new government. On 15 November 1995, Peres was invited by to form a new government. On 21 November, Peres signed a coalition agreement between Labor, Meretz and Yiud (which had been members of Rabin's government), which was formally approved by the Knesset the next day, establishing a new government with Peres as prime minister.\nPeres' second stint as prime minister ultimately lasted a total of seven months. During this time, he attempted to maintain the momentum of the peace process.\nOn 10 February 1996, Peres made the widely expected announcement that he would call early elections, moving the elections to late May, five months earlier than they otherwise were to be held. The election would be the first to use a new system in which the prime minister was directly elected in a vote coinciding with the Knesset election. Peres had hoped that early elections would deliver a mandate for his pursuit of a two-state solution. Peres had called the elections early because of promising polls. He was heavily leading in the polls for the prime minister vote at the time the election was called, with polls showing him to have between a twenty and twenty-five percent lead. Additionally, Labor was also leading in polls for the Knesset vote. Despite the promising polls, however, some in Labor had, even at this time, expressed concerns about the ability of Peres to win, given his failure to deliver an outright win for the Labor Party during his earlier stint as party leader. His lead in the polls began to decrease after the Jaffa Road bus bombings on 25 February 1996. However, even in the last month before the election, he enjoyed a reduced leading margin of around five percent.\nOn 11 April 1996, Peres initiated Operation Grapes of Wrath, which was triggered by Hezbollah Katyusha rockets fired into Israel in response to the killing of two Lebanese by an IDF missile. Israel conducted massive air raids and extensive shelling in southern Lebanon. 106 Lebanese civilians died in the shelling of Qana, when a UN compound was hit in an Israeli shelling.\nDuring his term, Peres promoted the use of the internet in Israel and created the first website of an Israeli prime minister.\nPost-premiership (1996\u20132007).\nLabor in opposition (1996\u20131999).\nPeres was narrowly defeated by Benjamin Netanyahu in the 1996 Israeli prime ministerial election. Not included in the new government, Labor became an opposition party again. This again placed Peres in the then-unofficial role of Knesset opposition leader.\nIn 1996, Peres founded the Peres Center for Peace, which has the aim of \"promot[ing] lasting peace and advancement in the Middle East by fostering tolerance, economic and technological development, cooperation and well-being.\"\nPeres did not seek re-election as Labor Party leader in 1997 and was replaced by Ehud Barak that year. Barak rebuffed Peres' attempt to secure the position of party president.\nMinister of Regional Cooperation (1999\u20132001).\nIn 1999, Ehud Barak was elected prime minister and formed a Labor-lead government. He appointed Peres (who was seen as a political rival of Barak) to the minor post of minister of regional cooperation. The position was vaguely defined, being expected to be tasked with advancing economic and political ties between Israel and the Arab world. The position also did not come with any government funding. Peres accepted the relatively low-ranked position reluctantly. For nearly all of time in this position Peres was sidelined, finding himself disallowed from playing a major role within the government.\nOn 1 November 2000, amid the Second Intifada, Peres met in the Gaza Strip with Arafat on behalf of the Israeli government. The two agreed to terms of a truce in the early hours of the following morning.\nAfter the resignation of Ezer Weizman, Peres ran in the 2000 Israeli presidential election, seeking to be elected by members of the Knesset to a seven-year term as Israel's president (a ceremonial head of state position which usually authorizes the selection of Prime Minister). However, he lost to Likud candidate Moshe Katsav. Katsav's victory was regarded to be in reaction to the perceived indications that Peres intended to use the presidency to provide his support to the increasingly unpopular peace processes that Barak's government was pursuing. His defeat was considered a significant upset, as he had been regarded as a heavy front-runner to win the Knesset vote. The editorial board of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that his defeat appeared to spell the end of Peres' long political career.\nThere was consideration given later that year to Peres potentially seeking the premiership again. On 20 November 2000, amid polls showing him to be in a virtual-tie with Ariel Sharon, an aide of Peres told the media that he would run in the 2001 direct election for prime minister. Peres himself told lawmakers that he intended to run. Despite this, Peres did not become a candidate. In January 2001, there was some talk among Cabinet members that it would be best for Peres to be the candidate of the left. However, this did not happen. In early January 2001, in a joint television appearance with Barak that promoted the government's intent to work towards peace, Peres told the media that his own goal was, \"not to become prime minister\", but was instead, \"to do the best for the state of Israel.\"\nMinister of Foreign Affairs (2001\u20132002).\nFollowing Barak's defeat by Ariel Sharon in the 2001 direct election for prime minister, Peres made yet another comeback. He helped with bringing Labor into a grand coalition unity government with Sharon's Likud (the Twenty-ninth government of Israel) and secured himself the post of foreign minister. In 2001, formal leadership of Labor passed to Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, and in 2002 it was passed to Amram Mitzna. Peres grew to be heavily criticized by many on the left, who accused him of clinging to his position as foreign minister in a government that was not seen as advancing the peace process. Left critics accused Peres of not acting in accordance with his own dovish stance. Peres resigned from his post as foreign minister when Labor left the unity government in advance of the 2003 Knesset election. Labor's departure from the unity government placed Labor in the opposition ahead of the 2003 Knesset election.\nInterim Labor Party leader (2003\u20132005).\nAfter the Labor Party suffered a crushing defeat in the 2003 Knesset election while under the leadership of Mitzna, Peres was made interim leader of the party on 19 June 2003.\nVice Prime Minister (2005).\nPeres led the Labor Party into a coalition with Sharon once more, reaching an agreement the end of 2004, and entering the party into the thirtieth government of Israel in January 2005. This came after the Sharon's support of \"disengagement\" from Gaza presented a diplomatic program that Labor could support. Sharon made Peres vice prime minister.\nAs interim party leader, Peres favored putting off the elections for as long as possible. He claimed that an early election would jeopardize both the September 2005 Gaza withdrawal plan and the standing of the party in a national unity government with Sharon. However, the majority pushed for an earlier date, as younger members of the party, among them Amir Peretz, Ophir Pines-Paz and Isaac Herzog, overtook established leaders such as Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Haim Ramon in the party ballot to divide up government portfolios.\nLoss of Labor Party leadership and defection to Kadima.\nPeres lost a bid for permanent leadership of the Labor Party to Amir Peretz in the November 2005 leadership election, held in advance of the 2006 elections. Peres received 40% of the vote to Peretz's 42.4%.\nLabor withdrew from the unity government on 23 November 2005. On 30 November 2005 Peres announced that he was leaving the Labor Party to support Ariel Sharon and his new Kadima party. In the immediate aftermath of Sharon's debilitating stroke days later (which left Sharon in a coma), there was speculation that Peres might take over as leader of the Kadima party; most senior Kadima leaders, however, were former members of Likud and indicated their support for Ehud Olmert as Sharon's successor. Labor reportedly tried to woo Peres to rejoin them. However, he announced that he supported Olmert and would remain with Kadima. Peres had previously announced his intention not to run in the March 2006 elections, but changed his mind.\nPeres resigned from the Knesset on 15 January 2006 due both to Attorney General Menahem Mazuz issuing a decision that ruled Peres and several others could not be appointed to ministerial posts by Prime Minister Olmert and because of a law that, due to him having switched parties, would have prevented him from running for the next Knesset if he remained an incumbent member of the Knesset. By that time, he had served in the Knesset for more than forty-six consecutive years.\nPeres was soon elected back to the Knesset in the 2006 election, this time as a member of Kadima. After the new Kadima-led thirty-first government was formed, Peres was given the role of vice prime minister and minister for the development of the Negev, Galilee and Regional Economy.\nPresidency (2007\u20132014).\nOn 13 June 2007, Peres was elected president of the State of Israel by the Knesset. 58 of 120 members of the Knesset voted for him in the first round (whereas 38 voted for Reuven Rivlin, and 21 for Colette Avital). His opponents then backed Peres in the second round and 86 members of the Knesset voted in his favor, while 23 objected. He resigned from his role as a member of the Knesset the same day, having been a member since November 1959 (except for a three-month period in early 2006), the longest serving in Israeli political history. Peres was sworn in as president on 15 July 2007.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Israel must not only be an asset but a value. A moral, cultural and scientific call for the promotion of man, every man. It must be a good and warm home for Jews who are not Israelis, as well as for Israelis who are not Jews. And it must create equal opportunities for all, without discriminating between religion, nationality, community or sex... I have seen Israel in its most difficult hours and also in moments of achievement and spiritual uplifting. My years place me at an observation point from which can be viewed the scene of our reviving nation, spread out in all its glory... Permit me to remain an optimist. Permit me to be a dreamer of his people. If sometimes the atmosphere is autumnal, and also if today, the day seems suddenly grey, the president Israel has chosen will never tire of encouraging, awakening and reminding - because spring is waiting for us. The spring will definitely come.\u2014\u200a\nOn 20 November 2008, Peres received an honorary knighthood, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George from Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace in London.\nIn June 2011, he was awarded the honorary title of \"sheikh\" by Bedouin dignitaries in Hura for his efforts to achieve Middle East peace. Peres thanks his hosts by saying \"This visit has been a pleasure. I am deeply impressed by Hura. You have done more for yourselves than anyone else could have\". He told the mayor of Hura, Dr. Muhammad Al-Nabari, and members of Hura's governing council, that they were \"part of the Negev. It cannot be developed without developing the Bedouin community, so that it may keep its traditions while joining the modern world.\"\nPost-presidency and death.\nPeres announced in April 2013 that he would not seek to extend his tenure beyond 2014. His successor, Reuven Rivlin, was elected on 10 June 2014 and took office on 24 July 2014.\nIn July 2016, Peres founded the 'Israel innovation center' in the Arab neighbourhood of Ajami, Jaffa, aiming to encourage young people from around the world to be inspired by technology.\nOn 13 September 2016, Peres suffered a severe stroke and was hospitalized at Sheba Medical Center. His condition was reported to be very serious, as he had suffered a massive brain hemorrhage and significant bleeding. Two days later, he was reported as being in a serious but stable condition. However, on 26 September, an examination found irreversible damage to his brainstem, indicating that it was not possible for him to recover, and the following day, his medical condition deteriorated significantly. He died on 28 September at the age of 93.\nTributes.\nOn hearing of his death, tributes came from leaders across the world. The president of Russia, Vladimir Putin said: \"I was extremely lucky to have met this extraordinary man many times. And every time I admired his courage, patriotism, wisdom, vision and ability.\" The president of China, Xi Jinping said: \"His death is the loss of an old friend for China.\" The president of India, Pranab Mukherjee said: \"Peres would be remembered as a steadfast friend of India.\" The President of the United States, Barack Obama said: \"I will always be grateful that I was able to call Shimon my friend.\"\nPeres was described by \"The New York Times\" as having done \"more than anyone to build up his country's formidable military might, then [having] worked as hard to establish a lasting peace with Israel's Arab neighbors.\"\nFuneral.\nThe funeral was held at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on 30 September 2016, with his burial place in the Great Leaders of the Nation section between former Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Yitzhak Shamir.\nAbout 4,000 mourners and world leaders from 75 countries attended the funeral, with President Barack Obama among those who gave a eulogy. Since the funeral for Nelson Mandela, this was only the second time Obama traveled overseas for the funeral of a foreign leader. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke. Among the other delegates in attendance and speaking were former president Bill Clinton. Other delegates included PA President Mahmoud Abbas, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, German President Joachim Gauck, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and King Felipe VI of Spain. The UK delegation included Prince Charles, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, former prime ministers David Cameron, Gordon Brown, and Tony Blair, and Britain's chief rabbi Ephraim Mirvis.\nPolitical views.\nPeres described himself as a \"Ben-Gurionist\", after his mentor Ben-Gurion. He felt that Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel was a means to a progressive end in which the State of Israel both inspire the world and survive in a region of the world where it was unwelcome.\nAs a younger man, Peres was once considered a \"hawk\". He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ben-Gurion and Dayan and an early supporter of the West Bank settlers during the 1970s. However, after becoming the leader of his party his stance evolved. Subsequently, he was seen as a dove, and a strong supporter of peace through economic cooperation. While still opposed, like all mainstream Israeli leaders in the 1970s and early 1980s, to talks with the PLO, he distanced himself from settlers and spoke of the need for \"territorial compromise\" over the West Bank and Gaza. For a time he hoped that King Hussein of Jordan could be Israel's Arab negotiating partner rather than Yasser Arafat. Peres met secretly with Hussein in London in 1987 and reached a framework agreement with him, but this was rejected by Israel's then Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir. Shortly afterward the First Intifada erupted, and whatever plausibility King Hussein had as a potential Israeli partner in resolving the fate of the West Bank evaporated. Subsequently, Peres gradually moved closer to support for talks with the PLO, although he avoided making an outright commitment to this policy until 1993.\nPeres was perhaps more closely associated with the Oslo Accords than any other Israeli politician (Rabin included) with the possible exception of his own prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Yossi Beilin. He remained an adamant supporter of the Oslo Accords and the Palestinian Authority since their inception despite the First Intifada and the al-Aqsa Intifada (Second Intifada). However, Peres supported Ariel Sharon's military policy of operating the Israeli Defense Forces to thwart suicide bombings.\nPeres's foreign policy outlook was markedly realist. To placate Turkey, Peres downplayed the Armenian genocide. Peres stated: \"We reject attempts to create a similarity between the Holocaust and the Armenian allegations. Nothing similar to the Holocaust occurred. It is a tragedy what the Armenians went through but not a genocide.\" Although Peres himself did not retract the statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry later issued a cable to its missions which stated that \"The minister absolutely did not say, as the Turkish news agency alleged, 'What the Armenians underwent was a tragedy, not a genocide.'\" However, according to Armenian news agencies, the statement released by the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles did not include any mention that Peres had not said that the events were not genocide.\nOn the issue of the nuclear program of Iran and the supposed existential threat this poses for Israel, Peres stated, \"I am not in favor of a military attack on Iran, but we must quickly and decisively establish a strong, aggressive coalition of nations that will impose painful economic sanctions on Iran\", adding \"Iran's efforts to achieve nuclear weapons should keep the entire world from sleeping soundly.\" In the same speech, Peres compared Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his call to \"wipe Israel off the map\" to the genocidal threats to European Jewry made by Adolf Hitler in the years prior to the Holocaust. In an interview with Army Radio on 8 May 2006 he remarked that \"the president of Iran should remember that Iran can also be wiped off the map.\" However, after his death it was revealed that Peres had said that he prevented a military strike on Iran's nuclear program that had been ordered by Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak in 2010.\nPeres was a proponent of Middle East economic integration.\nTechnology.\nPeres is regarded as one of the founders of Israel's technology sector. Through personal meetings with the French government, he established collaboration treaties with France's nuclear industry in 1954. In 1958, he founded the re-organized RAFAEL Armament Development Authority, under the MOD's jurisdiction. From his desk he would control all aspects of Israel's nuclear program (first as director general and after 1959 as deputy minister). In the 1980s, he is credited with having laid the economic foundations for Israel's start-up economy. In later years, he developed an obsessive fascination with nanotechnology and brain research. He believed that brain research would be the key to a better and more peaceful future. He launched his own nanotechnology investment fund in 2003, raising $5 million in the first week. In 2016, he founded the 'Israel innovation center' in the Arab neighbourhood of Ajami, Jaffa. The center aims to encourage young people from around the world to be inspired by technology. Laying its foundation stone on 21 July 2016, Peres said: \"We will prove that innovation has no limits and no barriers. Innovation enables dialogue between nations and between people. It will enable all young people \u2013 Jews, Muslims and Christians \u2014 to engage in science and technology equally.\"\nPersonal life and family.\nIn May 1945, Peres married Sonya Gelman, whom he had met in the Ben Shemen Youth Village, where her father served as a carpentry teacher. The couple married after Sonya finished her military service as a truck driver in the British Army during World War II. Through the years Sonya chose to stay away from the media and keep her privacy and the privacy of her family, despite her husband's extensive political career. Sonya Peres was unable to attend Shimon's 2007 presidential inauguration ceremony because of ill health. With the election of Peres for president, Sonya Peres, who had not wanted her husband to accept the position, announced that she would stay in the couple's apartment in Tel Aviv and not join her husband in Jerusalem. The couple thereafter lived separately. She died on 20 January 2011, aged 87, from heart failure at her apartment in Tel Aviv.\nShimon and Sonya Peres had three children. Their eldest child was a daughter, Dr. Tsvia (\"Tsiki\") Walden, who became a linguist and professor at Beit Berl Academic College. Their middle child was a son, Yoni, who became director of Village Veterinary Center, a veterinary hospital on the campus of Kfar Hayarok Agricultural School near Tel Aviv. He specializes in the treatment of guide dogs. Their youngest child, Nehemia (\"Chemi\"), became co-founder and managing general partner of Pitango Venture Capital, one of Israel's largest venture capital funds. Chemi Peres is a former helicopter pilot in the IAF.\nPeres was a cousin of actress Lauren Bacall (born Betty Joan Persky), although the two only discovered their relation to each other in the 1950s. Recalling this, Peres once remarked, \"In 1952 or 1953 I came to New York... Lauren Bacall called me, said that she wanted to meet, and we did. We sat and talked about where our families came from, and discovered that we were from the same family\".\nPeres was a polyglot, speaking Polish, French, English, Russian, Yiddish, and Hebrew. He never lost his Polish accent when speaking in Hebrew.\nPoetry and song-writing.\nPeres was a lifelong writer of poetry and songs. As a child in Vishnyeva, Poland he learned to play the mandolin. He wrote his first song when he was 8. He was inspired to write, including during cabinet meetings. Peres was noted to sometimes write stanzas during Cabinet meetings. As a result of his deep literary interests, he could quote from Hebrew prophets, French literature, and Chinese philosophy with equal ease. Many of his poems were turned into songs, with the proceedings of the albums going to charity. His songs have been performed by artists including Andrea Bocelli and Liel Kolet. The most recent of his songs was \"Chinese Melody\" (recorded in Mandarin with Chinese and Israeli musicians), released in February 2016, which he wrote to celebrate the Year of the Monkey (https:// on YouTube).\nUse of social media.\nDuring his presidency (2007\u20132014), Shimon Peres was noted for his embrace of social media to communicate with the public, being described as \"Israel's first social media president\", which included producing comedic videos on his YouTube channel such as \"Be my Friend for Peace\" and \"Former Israeli President Shimon Peres Goes Job Hunting\". After retirement, he led a viral campaign to encourage children to study mathematics. In one video, he sends his answer to the teacher by throwing a paper plane (https:// on YouTube). According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", his presence on platforms such as Snapchat, allowed him to \"pack more punch\u2014and humor\u2014into the causes he championed, especially peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians.\"\nPlaces named after Peres.\nFollowing his death, it was announced that Israel's Negev nuclear reactor and atomic research center, that had been constructed in 1958, would be named after Peres. Netanyahu stated: \"Shimon Peres worked hard to establish this important facility, a facility which has been very important for Israel's security for generations..\"\nPublished works.\nShimon Peres is the author of 11 books, including:\nOverview of offices held.\nPeres twice officially served as prime minister (Israel's head of government). His first stint spanned from 13 September 1984 through 20 October 1986, leading the 21st government during the first half of the 11th Knesset. His second stint lasted from 4 November 1995 through 18 June 1996 (serving in an acting capacity from 4 November through 22 November 1995; and in permanent capacity thereafter), leading the 25th government as interim prime minister and the 26th government as permanent prime minister during the latter portion of the 13th Knesset. In addition to these two official stints as prime minister, Peres is also considered to have served as the de facto acting prime minister from 22 April through 21 June 1977 (with Yitzhak Rabin remaining the de jure prime minister). Peres served as president (Israel's head of state) from 15 July 2007 through 24 July 2014. Peres was a member of the Knesset (Israel's legislature), first from November 1959 through 15 January 2006 (a record 47-year tenure), and again from March 2006 through 13 June 2007. His overall Knesset tenure of 48 years is the longest tenure in the history of the Knesset.\nPeres, four times, served as the leader of the Knesset's opposition. For his first three stints in this role, the opposition leader was an unofficial and honorary role. His final stint in the position came after Knesset formalized the role as an official position. Peres was the unofficial opposition leader from 20 June 1977 through 13 September 1984, during the entirety of the 9th and 10th Knessets. During this stint, he led the opposition to the Menachem Begin-led 18th and 19th governments and the Yitzhak Shamir-led 20th government of Israel. His second stint as opposition lasted from 15 March 1990 through 13 July 1992, when in lead the opposition to the Yitzhak Shamir-led 24th government during a portion of the 12th Knesset. Peres' third stint lasted from 18 June 1996 to 1 July 1997, and saw him lead the opposition to the Benjamin Netanyahu-led 24th government during a portion of the 14th Knesset. Peres' final stint as opposition leader lasted from 25 June 2003 through 10 January 2005, and saw him lead the opposition to the Ariel Sharon-led 30th government during a portion of the sixteenth Knesset.\nLabor Party leadership.\nPeres thrice served as leader of the Israeli Labor Party.\nMinisterial posts.\nPeres held numerous ministerial posts over the course of his Knesset tenure. He held major ministerial posts in twelve governments.\nOther offices.\nFrom 1952 through 1953, Peres was the deputy director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. From 1952 through 1959, he was the director general.\nPeres served as vice president of Socialist International. He was elected vice president in 1978."}
{"id": "48570", "revid": "22505519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48570", "title": "Ecgberht, King of Wessex", "text": "King of Wessex from 802 to 839\nEcgberht (died 839), also spelled Egbert, Ecgbert, Ecgbriht, Ecgbeorht, and Ecbert, was King of Wessex from 802 until his death in 839. His father was King Ealhmund of Kent. In the 780s, Ecgberht was forced into exile to Charlemagne's court in the Frankish Empire by the kings Offa of Mercia and Beorhtric of Wessex, but on Beorhtric's death in 802, Ecgberht returned and took the throne.\nLittle is known of the first 20 years of Ecgberht's reign, but it is thought that he was able to maintain the independence of Wessex against the kingdom of Mercia, which at that time dominated the other southern English kingdoms. In 825, Ecgberht defeated Beornwulf of Mercia, ended Mercian Supremacy at the Battle of Ellandun, and proceeded to take control of the Mercian dependencies in southeastern England. In 829, he defeated Wiglaf of Mercia and drove him out of his kingdom, temporarily ruling Mercia directly. Later that year Ecgberht received the submission of the Northumbrian king at Dore. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" subsequently described Ecgberht as a \"bretwalda\" or 'wide-ruler' of Anglo-Saxon lands.\nEcgberht was unable to maintain this dominant position, and within a year Wiglaf regained the throne of Mercia. However, Wessex did retain control of Kent, Sussex, and Surrey; these territories were given to Ecgberht's son \u00c6thelwulf to rule as a subking under Ecgberht. When Ecgberht died in 839, \u00c6thelwulf succeeded him; the southeastern kingdoms were finally absorbed into the kingdom of Wessex after the death of \u00c6thelwulf's son \u00c6thelbald in 860. Ecgberht's descendants ruled Wessex and, later, all of England continuously until 1013.\nFamily.\nHistorians do not agree on Ecgberht's ancestry. The earliest version of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,\" the \"Parker Chronicle,\" begins with a genealogical preface tracing the ancestry of Ecgberht's son \u00c6thelwulf back through Ecgberht, Ealhmund (thought to be king Ealhmund of Kent), and the otherwise unknown Eafa and Eoppa to Ingild, brother of King Ine of Wessex, who abdicated the throne in 726. It continues back to Cerdic, founder of the House of Wessex. Ecgberht's descent from Ingild was accepted by Frank Stenton, but not the earlier genealogy back to Cerdic. Heather Edwards in her \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" article on Ecgberht argues that he was of Kentish origin and that the West Saxon descent may have been manufactured during his reign to give him legitimacy, whereas Rory Naismith considered a Kentish origin unlikely, and that it is more probable that \"Ecgberht was born of good West Saxon royal stock\".\nEcgberht's wife's name is unknown. A fifteenth-century chronicle now held by Oxford University names her as Redburga, supposedly a relative of Charlemagne whom he married when he was banished to Francia, but this is dismissed by academic historians in view of its late date.\nHe is reputed to have had a half-sister Alburga, later to be recognised as a saint for her founding of Wilton Abbey. She was married to Wulfstan, ealdorman of Wiltshire, and on his death in 802 she became a nun, Abbess of Wilton Abbey.\nPolitical context and early life.\nOffa of Mercia, who reigned from 757 to 796, was the dominant force in Anglo-Saxon England in the second half of the eighth century. The relationship between Offa and Cynewulf, who was king of Wessex from 757 to 786, is not well documented, but it seems likely that Cynewulf maintained some independence from Mercian overlordship. Evidence of the relationship between kings can come from charters, which were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen, and which were witnessed by the kings who had the power to grant the land.\nSubregulus.\nIn some cases a king will appear on a charter as a \"subregulus\" (subking or underking), making it clear that he has an overlord. Cynewulf appears as \"King of the West Saxons\" on a charter of Offa's in 772, and in 779, he was defeated at the Battle of Bensington by Offa, but there is nothing else to suggest Cynewulf was not his own master, and he is not known to have acknowledged Offa as overlord. Offa did have influence in the southeast of the country: a charter of 764 shows him in the company of Heahberht of Kent, suggesting that Offa's influence helped place Heahberht on the throne. The extent of Offa's control of Kent between 765 and 776 is a matter of debate amongst historians, but from 776 until about 784 it appears that the Kentish kings had substantial independence from Mercia.\nAnother Ecgberht, Ecgberht II of Kent, ruled in that kingdom throughout the 770s; he is last mentioned in 779, in a charter granting land at Rochester. In 784 a new king of Kent, Ealhmund, appears in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". According to a note in the margin, \"this king Ealhmund was Egbert's father [i.e. Ecgberht of Wessex], Egbert was \u00c6thelwulf's father\". This is supported by the genealogical preface from the A text of the \"Chronicle\", which gives Ecgberht's father's name as Ealhmund without further details. The preface probably dates from the late ninth century; the marginal note is on the F manuscript of the \"Chronicle\", which is a Kentish version dating from about 1100.\nEalhmund does not appear to have long survived in power: there is no record of his activities after 784. There is, however, the extensive evidence of Offa's domination of Kent during the late 780s, with his goals apparently going beyond overlordship to outright annexation of the kingdom, and he has been described as \"the rival, not the overlord, of the Kentish kings\". It is possible that the young Ecgberht fled to Wessex in 785 or so; it is suggestive that the \"Chronicle\" mentions in a later entry that Beorhtric, Cynewulf's successor, helped Offa to exile Ecgberht.\nCynewulf was murdered in 786. His succession was contested by Ecgberht, but he was defeated by Beorhtric, maybe with Offa's assistance. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" records that Ecgberht spent three years in Francia before he was king, exiled by Beorhtric and Offa. The text says \"iii\" for three, but this may have been a scribal error, with the correct reading being \"xiii\", which is thirteen years. Beorhtric's reign lasted sixteen years, and not thirteen; and all extant texts of the \"Chronicle\" agree on \"iii\", but many modern accounts assume that Ecgberht did indeed spend thirteen years in Francia. This requires assuming that the error in transcription is common to every manuscript of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\"; many historians make this assumption but others have rejected it as unlikely, given the consistency of the sources. In either case Ecgberht was probably exiled in 789, when Beorhtric, his rival, married the daughter of Offa of Mercia.\nAt the time Ecgberht was in exile, Francia was ruled by Charlemagne, who maintained Frankish influence in Northumbria and is known to have supported Offa's enemies in the south. Another exile in Gaul at this time was Odberht, a priest, who is almost certainly the same person as Eadberht, who later became king of Kent. According to a later chronicler, William of Malmesbury, Ecgberht learned the arts of government during his time in Gaul.\nEarly reign.\nBeorhtric's dependency on Mercia continued into the reign of Cenwulf, who became king of Mercia a few months after Offa's death. Beorhtric died in 802, and Ecgberht came to the throne of Wessex, probably with the support of Charlemagne and perhaps also the papacy. The Mercians continued to oppose Ecgberht: the day of his accession, the Hwicce (who had originally formed a separate kingdom, but by that time were part of Mercia) attacked, under the leadership of their ealdorman, \u00c6thelmund. Weohstan, a Wessex ealdorman, met him with men from Wiltshire; according to a 15th-century source, Weohstan had married Alburga, Ecgberht's sister, and so was his brother-in-law. The Hwicce were defeated, though Weohstan was killed as well as \u00c6thelmund. Nothing more is recorded of Ecgberht's relations with Mercia for more than twenty years after this battle. It seems likely that Ecgberht had no influence outside his own borders, but on the other hand, there is no evidence that he ever submitted to the overlordship of Cenwulf. Cenwulf did have overlordship of the rest of southern England, but in Cenwulf's charters the title of \"overlord of the southern English\" never appears, presumably in consequence of the independence of the kingdom of Wessex.\nIn 815, \"The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" records that Ecgberht ravaged the whole of the territories of the remaining British kingdom, Dumnonia, known to the author of \"The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" as the West Welsh; their territory was about equivalent to what is now Cornwall. Ten years later, a charter dated 19 August 825 indicates that Ecgberht was campaigning in Dumnonia again; this may have been related to a battle recorded in the \"Chronicle\" at Gafulford in 823, between the men of Devon and the Britons of Cornwall.\nBattle of Ellandun.\nIt was also in 825 that one of the most important battles in Anglo-Saxon history took place, when Ecgberht defeated Beornwulf of Mercia at Ellandun\u2014now Wroughton, near Swindon. This battle marked the end of the Mercian domination of southern England. The \"Chronicle\" tells how Ecgberht followed up his victory: \"Then he sent his son \u00c6thelwulf from the army, and Ealhstan, his bishop, and Wulfheard, his ealdorman, to Kent with a great troop.\" \u00c6thelwulf drove Baldred, the king of Kent, north over the Thames, and according to the \"Chronicle\", the men of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex then all submitted to \u00c6thelwulf \"because earlier they were wrongly forced away from his relatives\". This may refer to Offa's interventions in Kent at the time Ecgberht's father Ealhmund became king; if so, the chronicler's remark may also indicate Ealhmund had connections elsewhere in southeast England.\nThe \"Chronicle\"'s version of events makes it appear that Baldred was driven out shortly after the battle, but this was probably not the case. A document from Kent survives which gives the date, March 826, as being in the third year of the reign of Beornwulf. This makes it likely that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent at this date, as Baldred's overlord; hence Baldred was apparently still in power. In Essex, Ecgberht expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown. It may have been delayed until 829 since a later chronicler associates the expulsion with a campaign of Ecgberht's in that year against the Mercians.\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" does not say who was the aggressor at Ellandun, but one recent history asserts that Beornwulf was almost certainly the one who attacked. According to this view, Beornwulf may have taken advantage of the Wessex campaign in Dumnonia in the summer of 825. Beornwulf's motivation to launch an attack would have been the threat of unrest or instability in the southeast: the dynastic connections with Kent made Wessex a threat to Mercian dominance.\nThe consequences of Ellandun went beyond the immediate loss of Mercian power in the southeast. According to the \"Chronicle\", the East Anglians asked for Ecgberht's protection against the Mercians in the same year, 825, though it may actually have been in the following year that the request was made. In 826 Beornwulf invaded East Anglia, presumably to recover his overlordship. He was slain, however, as was his successor, Ludeca, who invaded East Anglia in 827, evidently for the same reason. It may be that the Mercians were hoping for support from Kent: there was some reason to suppose that Wulfred, the Archbishop of Canterbury, might be discontented with West Saxon rule, as Ecgberht had terminated Wulfred's currency and had begun to mint his own, at Rochester and Canterbury, and it is known that Ecgberht seized property belonging to Canterbury. The outcome in East Anglia was a disaster for the Mercians, which confirmed West Saxon power in the southeast.\nDefeat of Mercia.\nIn 829 Ecgberht invaded Mercia and drove Wiglaf, the king of Mercia, into exile. This victory gave Ecgberht control of the London Mint, and he issued coins as King of Mercia. It was after this victory that the West Saxon scribe described him as a \"bretwalda\", meaning 'wide-ruler' or perhaps 'Britain-ruler', in a famous passage in \"The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". The relevant part of the annal reads, in the C manuscript of the \"Chronicle\":\n\"\u204a \u00fey geare geeode Ecgbriht cing Myrcna rice \u204a eall \u00fe\u00e6t be su\u00fean Humbre w\u00e6s, \u204a he w\u00e6s eahta\u00fea cing se \u00f0e Bretenanwealda w\u00e6s.\"\nIn modern English:\nAnd the same year King Egbert conquered the kingdom of Mercia, and all that was south of the Humber, and he was the eighth king who was 'Wide-ruler'.\nThe previous seven \"bretwaldas\" are also named by the Chronicler, who gives the same seven names that Bede lists as holding \"imperium\", starting with \u00c6lle of Sussex and ending with Oswiu of Northumbria. The list is often thought to be incomplete, omitting as it does some dominant Mercian kings such as Penda and Offa. The exact meaning of the title has been much debated; it has been described as \"a term of encomiastic poetry\" but there is also evidence that it implied a definite role of military leadership.\nLater in 829, according to \"The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", Ecgberht received the submission of the Northumbrians at Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield); the Northumbrian king was probably Eanred. According to a later chronicler, Roger of Wendover, Ecgberht invaded Northumbria and plundered it before Eanred submitted: \"When Ecgberht had obtained all the southern kingdoms, he led a large army into Northumbria, and laid waste that province with severe pillaging, and made King Eanred pay tribute.\" Roger of Wendover is known to have incorporated Northumbrian annals into his version; the \"Chronicle\" does not mention these events. However, the nature of Eanred's submission has been questioned: one historian has suggested that it is more likely that the meeting at Dore represented a mutual recognition of sovereignty.\nIn 830, Ecgberht led a successful expedition against the Welsh, almost certainly with the intent of extending West Saxon influence into the Welsh lands previously within the Mercian orbit. This marked the high point of Ecgberht's influence.\nReduction in influence after 829.\nIn 830, Mercia regained its independence under Wiglaf\u2014the \"Chronicle\" merely says that Wiglaf \"obtained the kingdom of Mercia again\", but the most likely explanation is that this was the result of a Mercian rebellion against the Wessex rule.\nEcgberht's dominion over southern England came to an end with Wiglaf's recovery of power. Wiglaf's return is followed by evidence of his independence from Wessex. Charters indicate Wiglaf had authority in Middlesex and Berkshire, and in a charter of 836, Wiglaf uses the phrase \"my bishops, \"duces\", and magistrates\" to describe a group that included eleven bishops from the episcopate of Canterbury, including bishops of sees in West Saxon territory. It is significant that Wiglaf was still able to call together such a group of notables; the West Saxons, even if they were able to do so, held no such councils. Wiglaf may also have brought Essex back into the Mercian orbit during the years after he recovered the throne. In East Anglia, King \u00c6thelstan minted coins, possibly as early as 827, but more likely c. 830 after Ecgberht's influence was reduced with Wiglaf's return to power in Mercia. This demonstration of independence on East Anglia's part is not surprising, as it was \u00c6thelstan who was probably responsible for the defeat and death of both Beornwulf and Ludeca.\nBoth Wessex's sudden rise to power in the late 820s, and the subsequent failure to retain this dominant position, have been examined by historians looking for underlying causes. One plausible explanation for the events of these years is that Wessex's fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Franks supported Eardwulf when he recovered the throne of Northumbria in 808, so it is plausible that they also supported Ecgberht's accession in 802. At Easter 839, not long before Ecgberht's death, he was in touch with Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, to arrange safe passage to Rome. Hence a continuing relationship with the Franks seems to be part of southern English politics during the first half of the ninth century.\nCarolingian support may have been one of the factors that helped Ecgberht achieve the military successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious\u2014the first of a series of internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia, and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.\nDespite the loss of dominance, Ecgberht's military successes fundamentally changed the political landscape of Anglo-Saxon England. Wessex retained control of the south-eastern kingdoms, with the possible exception of Essex, and Mercia did not regain control of East Anglia. Ecgberht's victories marked the end of the independent existence of the kingdoms of Kent and Sussex. The conquered territories were administered as a subkingdom for a while, including Surrey and possibly Essex. Although \u00c6thelwulf was a subking under Ecgberht, it is clear that he maintained his own royal household, with which he travelled around his kingdom. Charters issued in Kent described Ecgberht and \u00c6thelwulf as \"kings of the West Saxons and also of the people of Kent\". When \u00c6thelwulf died in 858 his will, in which Wessex is left to one son and the southeastern kingdom to another, makes it clear that it was not until after 858 that the kingdoms were fully integrated. Mercia remained a threat, however; Ecgberht's son \u00c6thelwulf, established as king of Kent, gave estates to Christ Church, Canterbury, probably to counter any influence the Mercians might still have there.\nIn the southwest, Ecgberht was defeated in 836 at Carhampton by the Danes, but in 838 he won a battle against them and their allies, the West Welsh, at the Battle of Hingston Down in Cornwall. The Dumnonian royal line continued after this time, but it is at this date that the independence of one of the last British kingdoms may be considered to have ended. The details of Anglo-Saxon expansion into Cornwall are quite poorly recorded, but some evidence comes from place names. The River Ottery, which flows east into the Tamar near Launceston, appears to be a boundary: south of the Ottery the placenames are overwhelmingly Cornish, whereas to the north they are more heavily influenced by the English newcomers.\nSuccession.\nAt a council at Kingston upon Thames in 838, Ecgberht and \u00c6thelwulf granted land to the sees of Winchester and Canterbury in return for the promise of support for \u00c6thelwulf's claim to the throne. The archbishop of Canterbury, Ceolnoth, also accepted Ecgberht and \u00c6thelwulf as the lords and protectors of the monasteries under Ceolnoth's control. These agreements, along with a later charter in which \u00c6thelwulf confirmed church privileges, suggest that the church had recognised that Wessex was a new political power that must be dealt with. Churchmen consecrated the king at coronation ceremonies, and helped to write the wills which specified the king's heir; their support had real value in establishing West Saxon control and a smooth succession for Ecgberht's line. Both the record of the Council of Kingston, and another charter of that year, include the identical phrasing: that a condition of the grant is that \"we ourselves and our heirs shall always hereafter have firm and unshakable friendships from Archbishop Ceolnoth and his congregation at Christ Church.\"\nAlthough nothing is known of any other claimants to the throne, it is likely that there were other surviving descendants of Cerdic (the supposed progenitor of all the kings of Wessex) who might have contended for the kingdom. Ecgberht died in 839, and his will, according to the account of it found in the will of his grandson, Alfred the Great, left land only to male members of his family, so that the estates should not be lost to the royal house through marriage. Ecgberht's wealth, acquired through conquest, was no doubt one reason for his ability to purchase the support of the southeastern church establishment; the thriftiness of his will indicates he understood the importance of personal wealth to a king. The kingship of Wessex had been frequently contested among different branches of the royal line, and it is a noteworthy achievement of Ecgberht's that he was able to ensure \u00c6thelwulf's untroubled succession. In addition, \u00c6thelwulf's experience of kingship, in the subkingdom formed from Ecgberht's southeastern conquests, would have been valuable to him when he took the throne.\nEcgberht was buried in Winchester, as were his son, \u00c6thelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder. During the ninth century, Winchester began to show signs of urbanisation, and it is likely that the sequence of burials indicates that Winchester was held in high regard by the West Saxon royal line.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 825, his father, King Ecgberht, defeated King Beornwulf of Mercia, ending a long Mercian dominance over Anglo-Saxon England south of the Humber. Ecgberht sent \u00c6thelwulf with an army to Kent, where he expelled the Mercian sub-king and was himself appointed sub-king. After 830, Ecgberht maintained good relations with Mercia, and this was continued by \u00c6thelwulf when he became king in 839, the first son to succeed his father as West Saxon king since 641.\nThe Vikings were not a major threat to Wessex during \u00c6thelwulf's reign. In 843, he was defeated in a battle against the Vikings at Carhampton in Somerset, but he achieved a major victory at the Battle of Aclea in 851. In 853, he joined a successful Mercian expedition to Wales to restore the traditional Mercian hegemony, and in the same year, his daughter \u00c6thelswith married King Burgred of Mercia. In 855, \u00c6thelwulf went on a pilgrimage to Rome. In preparation he gave a \"decimation\", donating a tenth of his personal property to his subjects; he appointed his eldest surviving son \u00c6thelbald to act as King of Wessex in his absence, and his next son \u00c6thelberht to rule Kent and the south-east. \u00c6thelwulf spent a year in Rome, and on his way back he married Judith, the daughter of the West Frankish king Charles the Bald.\nWhen \u00c6thelwulf returned to England, \u00c6thelbald refused to surrender the West Saxon throne, and \u00c6thelwulf agreed to divide the kingdom, taking the east and leaving the west in \u00c6thelbald's hands. On \u00c6thelwulf's death in 858, he left Wessex to \u00c6thelbald and Kent to \u00c6thelberht, but \u00c6thelbald's death only two years later led to the reunification of the kingdom. In the 20th century, \u00c6thelwulf's reputation among historians was poor: he was seen as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage was viewed as a desertion of his duties. Historians in the 21st century see him very differently, as a king who consolidated and extended the power of his dynasty, commanded respect on the continent, and dealt more effectively than most of his contemporaries with Viking attacks. He is regarded as one of the most successful West Saxon kings, who laid the foundations for the success of his youngest son, Alfred the Great.\nBackground.\nAt the beginning of the 9th century, England was almost completely under the control of the Anglo-Saxons, with Mercia and Wessex the most important southern kingdoms. Mercia was dominant until the 820s, and it exercised overlordship over East Anglia and Kent, but Wessex was able to maintain its independence from its more powerful neighbour. Offa, king of Mercia from 757 to 796, was the dominant figure of the second half of the 8th century. King Beorhtric of Wessex (786\u2013802), married Offa's daughter in 789. Beorhtric and Offa drove \u00c6thelwulf's father Ecgberht into exile, and he spent several years at the court of Charlemagne in Francia. Ecgberht was the son of Ealhmund, who had briefly been King of Kent in 784. Following Offa's death, King Coenwulf of Mercia (796\u2013821) maintained Mercian dominance, but it is uncertain whether Beorhtric ever accepted political subordination, and when he died in 802 Ecgberht became king, perhaps with the support of Charlemagne. For two hundred years three kindreds had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. Ecgberht's best claim was that he was the great-great-grandson of Ingild, brother of King Ine (688\u2013726), and in 802 it would have seemed very unlikely that he would establish a lasting dynasty.\nAlmost nothing is recorded of the first twenty years of Ecgberht's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s. The historian Richard Abels argues that the silence of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" was probably intentional, concealing Ecgberht's purge of Beorhtric's magnates and suppression of rival royal lines. Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish subjects were distant. Kentish ealdormen did not attend the court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury (805\u2013832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's primary concern seems to have been to gain access to the wealth of Kent. His successors Ceolwulf I (821\u2013823) and Beornwulf (823\u2013826) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, Baldred.\nEngland had suffered Viking raids in the late 8th century, but no attacks were recorded between 794 and 835 when the Isle of Sheppey in Kent was ravaged. In 836, Ecgberht was defeated by the Vikings at Carhampton in Somerset, but in 838, he was victorious over an alliance of Cornishmen and Vikings at the Battle of Hingston Down, reducing Cornwall to the status of a client kingdom.\nFamily.\n\u00c6thelwulf's father Ecgberht was king of Wessex from 802 to 839. His mother's name is unknown, and he had no recorded siblings. He is known to have had two wives in succession, and so far as is known, Osburh, the senior of the two, was the mother of all his children. She was the daughter of Oslac, described by Asser, biographer of their son Alfred the Great, as \"King \u00c6thelwulf's famous butler\", a man who was descended from Jutes who had ruled the Isle of Wight. \u00c6thelwulf had six known children. His eldest son, \u00c6thelstan, was old enough to be appointed King of Kent in 839, so he must have been born by the early 820s, and he died in the early 850s. The second son, \u00c6thelbald, is first recorded as a charter witness in 841, and if, like Alfred, he began to attest when he was around six, he would have been born around 835; he was King of Wessex from 858 to 860. \u00c6thelwulf's third son, \u00c6thelberht, was probably born around 839 and was king from 860 to 865. The only daughter, \u00c6thelswith, married Burgred, King of Mercia, in 853. The other two sons were much younger: \u00c6thelred was born around 848 and was king from 865 to 871, and Alfred was born around 849 and was king from 871 to 899. In 856, \u00c6thelwulf married Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, King of West Francia and future Carolingian Emperor, and his wife Ermentrude. Osburh had probably died, although it is possible that she had been repudiated. There were no children from \u00c6thelwulf's marriage to Judith, and after his death, she married his eldest surviving son and successor, \u00c6thelbald.\nEarly life.\n\u00c6thelwulf was first recorded in 825, when Ecgberht won the crucial Battle of Ellandun in Wiltshire against King Beornwulf of Mercia, ending the long Mercian ascendancy over southern England. Ecgberht followed it up by sending \u00c6thelwulf with Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Wulfheard, Ealdorman of Hampshire, with a large army into Kent to expel sub-king Baldred. \u00c6thelwulf was descended from kings of Kent, and he was sub-king of Kent, and of Surrey, Sussex and Essex, which were then included in the sub-kingdom, until he inherited the throne of Wessex in 839. His sub-kingship is recorded in charters, in some of which King Ecgberht acted with his son's permission, such as a grant in 838 to Bishop Beornmod of Rochester, and \u00c6thelwulf himself issued a charter as King of Kent in the same year. Unlike their Mercian predecessors, who alienated the Kentish people by ruling from a distance, \u00c6thelwulf and his father successfully cultivated local support by governing through Kentish ealdormen and promoting their interests. In Abels' view, Ecgberht and \u00c6thelwulf rewarded their friends and purged Mercian supporters. Historians take differing views on the attitude of the new regime to the Kentish church. At Canterbury in 828, Ecgberht granted privileges to the bishopric of Rochester, and according to the historian Simon Keynes, Ecgberht and \u00c6thelwulf took steps to secure the support of Archbishop Wulfred. However, Nicholas Brooks argues that Wulfred's Mercian origin and connections proved a liability. \u00c6thelwulf seized an estate in East Malling from the Canterbury church on the ground that it had only been granted by Baldred when he was in flight from the West Saxon forces; the issue of archiepiscopal coinage was suspended for several years; and the only estate Wulfred was granted after 825 he received from King Wiglaf of Mercia.\nIn 829, Ecgberht conquered Mercia, only for Wiglaf to recover his kingdom a year later. The scholar David Kirby sees Wiglaf's restoration in 830 as a dramatic reversal for Ecgberht, which was probably followed by his loss of control of the London mint and the Mercian recovery of Essex and Berkshire, and the historian Heather Edwards states that his \"immense conquest could not be maintained\". However, in the view of Keynes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is interesting\u00a0... that both Ecgberht and his son \u00c6thelwulf appear to have respected the separate identity of Kent and its associated provinces, as if there appears to have been no plan at this stage to absorb the southeast into an enlarged kingdom stretching across the whole of southern England. Nor does it seem to have been the intention of Ecgberht and his successors to maintain the supremacy of any kind over the kingdom of Mercia\u00a0... It is quite possible that Ecgberht had relinquished Mercia of his own volition; and there is no suggestion that any residual antagonism affected relations between the rulers of Wessex and Mercia thereafter.\nIn 838, King Ecgberht held an assembly at Kingston in Surrey, where \u00c6thelwulf may have been consecrated as king by the archbishop. Ecgberht restored the East Malling estate to Wulfred's successor as Archbishop of Canterbury, Ceolnoth, in return for a promise of \"firm and unbroken friendship\" for himself and \u00c6thelwulf and their heirs, and the same condition is specified in a grant to the see of Winchester. Ecgberht thus ensured support for \u00c6thelwulf, who became the first son to succeed his father as West Saxon king since 641. At the same meeting, Kentish monasteries chose \u00c6thelwulf as their lord, and he undertook that, after his death, they would have freedom to elect their heads. Wulfred had devoted his archiepiscopate to fighting against secular power over Kentish monasteries, but Ceolnoth now surrendered effective control to \u00c6thelwulf, whose offer of freedom from control after his death was unlikely to be honoured by his successors. Kentish ecclesiastics and laymen now looked for protection against Viking attacks to West Saxon rather than Mercian royal power.\nEcgberht's conquests brought him wealth far greater than his predecessors had enjoyed and enabled him to purchase the support which secured the West Saxon throne for his descendants. The stability brought by the dynastic succession of Ecgberht and \u00c6thelwulf led to an expansion of commercial and agrarian resources, and to an expansion of royal income. The wealth of the West Saxon kings was also increased by the agreement in 838\u2013839 with Archbishop Ceolnoth for the previously independent West Saxon minsters to accept the king as their secular lord in return for his protection. However, there was no certainty that the hegemony of Wessex would prove more permanent than that of Mercia.\nKing of Wessex.\nWhen \u00c6thelwulf succeeded to the throne of Wessex in 839, his experience as sub-king of Kent had given him valuable training in kingship, and he in turn made his own sons sub-kings. According to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", on his accession \"he gave to his son \u00c6thelstan the kingdom of the people of Kent, and the kingdom of the East Saxons [Essex] and of the people of Surrey and the South Saxons [Sussex]\". However, \u00c6thelwulf did not give \u00c6thelstan the same power as his father had given him, and although \u00c6thelstan attested his father's charters as king, he does not appear to have been given the power to issue his own charters. \u00c6thelwulf exercised authority in the south-east and made regular visits there. He governed Wessex and Kent as separate spheres, and assemblies in each kingdom were only attended by the nobility of that country. The historian Janet Nelson says that \"\u00c6thelwulf ran a Carolingian-style family firm of plural realms, held together by his own authority as father-king, and by the consent of distinct \u00e9lites.\" He maintained his father's policy of governing Kent through ealdormen appointed from the local nobility and advancing their interests, but gave less support to the church. In 843, \u00c6thelwulf granted ten hides at Little Chart to \u00c6thelmod, the brother of the leading Kentish ealdorman Ealhere, and \u00c6thelmod succeeded to the post on his brother's death in 853. In 844, \u00c6thelwulf granted land at Horton in Kent to Ealdorman Eadred, with permission to transfer parts of it to local landowners; in a culture of reciprocity, this created a network of mutual friendships and obligations between the beneficiaries and the king. Archbishops of Canterbury were firmly in the West Saxon king's sphere. His ealdormen enjoyed a high status and were sometimes placed higher than the king's sons in lists of witnesses to charters. His reign is the first for which there is evidence of royal priests, and Malmesbury Abbey regarded him as an important benefactor, who is said to have been the donor of a shrine for the relics of Saint Aldhelm.\nAfter 830, Ecgberht followed a policy of maintaining good relations with Mercia, and this was continued by \u00c6thelwulf when he became king. London was traditionally a Mercian town, but in the 830s it was under West Saxon control; soon after \u00c6thelwulf's accession, it reverted to Mercian control. King Wiglaf of Mercia died in 839 and his successor, Berhtwulf, revived the Mercian mint in London; the two kingdoms appear to have struck a joint issue in the mid-840s, possibly indicating West Saxon help in reviving Mercian coinage, and showing the friendly relations between the two powers. Berkshire was still Mercian in 844, but by 849 it was part of Wessex, as Alfred was born in that year at the West Saxon royal estate in Wantage, then in Berkshire. However, the local Mercian ealdorman, also called \u00c6thelwulf, retained his position under the West Saxon kings. Berhtwulf died in 852 and cooperation with Wessex continued under Burgred, his successor as King of Mercia, who married \u00c6thelwulf's daughter \u00c6thelswith in 853. In the same year, \u00c6thelwulf assisted Burgred in a successful attack on Wales to restore the traditional Mercian hegemony over the Welsh.\nIn 9th-century Mercia and Kent, royal charters were produced by religious houses, each with its own style, but in Wessex, there was a single royal diplomatic tradition, probably by a single agency acting for the king. This may have originated in Ecgberht's reign, and it becomes clear in the 840s when \u00c6thelwulf had a Frankish secretary called Felix. There were strong contacts between the West Saxon and Carolingian courts. The \"Annals of St Bertin\" took particular interest in Viking attacks on Britain, and in 852 Lupus, the Abbot of Ferri\u00e8res and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Charles the Bald, wrote to \u00c6thelwulf congratulating him on his victory over the Vikings and requesting a gift of lead to cover his church roof. Lupus also wrote to his \"most beloved friend\" Felix, asking him to manage the transport of the lead. Unlike Canterbury and the south-east, Wessex did not see a sharp decline in the standard of Latin in charters in the mid-9th century, and this may have been partly due to Felix and his continental contacts. Lupus thought that Felix had great influence over the King. Charters were mainly issued from royal estates in counties which were the heartland of ancient Wessex, namely Hampshire, Somerset, Wiltshire, and Dorset, with a few in Kent.\nAn ancient division between east and west Wessex continued to be important in the 9th century; the boundary was Selwood Forest on the borders of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire. The two bishoprics of Wessex were Sherborne in the west and Winchester in the east. \u00c6thelwulf's family connections seem to have been west of Selwood, but his patronage was concentrated further east, particularly on Winchester, where his father was buried, and where he appointed Swithun to succeed Helmstan as bishop in 852\u2013853. However, he made a grant of land in Somerset to his leading ealdorman, Eanwulf, and on 26 December 846, he granted a large estate to himself in South Hams in west Devon. He thus changed it from royal demesne, which he was obliged to pass on to his successor as king, to bookland, which could be transferred as the owner pleased, so he could make land grants to followers to improve security in a frontier zone.\nViking threat.\nViking raids increased in the early 840s on both sides of the English Channel, and in 843 \u00c6thelwulf was defeated by the companies of 35 Danish ships at Carhampton in Somerset. In 850 sub-king \u00c6thelstan and Ealdorman Ealhhere of Kent won a naval victory over a large Viking fleet off Sandwich in Kent, capturing nine ships and driving off the rest. \u00c6thelwulf granted Ealhhere a large estate in Kent, but \u00c6thelstan is not heard of again and probably died soon afterwards. The following year the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" records five different attacks on southern England. A Danish fleet of 350 Viking ships took London and Canterbury, and when King Berhtwulf of Mercia went to their relief he was defeated. The Vikings then moved on to Surrey, where they were defeated by \u00c6thelwulf and his son \u00c6thelbald at the Battle of Aclea. According to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" the West Saxon levies, \"there made the greatest slaughter of a heathen that we have heard tell of up to the present day\". The \"Chronicle\" frequently reported victories during \u00c6thelwulf's reign won by levies led by ealdormen, unlike the 870s when a royal command was emphasised, reflecting a more consensual style of leadership in the earlier period.\nIn 850, a Danish army wintered on Thanet, and in 853, ealdormen Ealhhere of Kent and Huda of Surrey were killed in a battle against the Vikings, also on Thanet. In 855, Danish Vikings stayed over the winter on Sheppey, before carrying on their pillaging of eastern England. However, during \u00c6thelwulf's reign, Viking attacks were contained and did not present a major threat.\nCoinage.\nThe silver penny was almost the only coin used in middle and later Anglo-Saxon England. \u00c6thelwulf's coinage came from a main mint in Canterbury and a secondary one at Rochester; both had been used by Ecgberht for his own coinage after he gained control of Kent. During \u00c6thelwulf's reign, there were four main phases of the coinage distinguishable at both mints, though they are not exactly parallel and it is uncertain when the transitions took place. The first issue at Canterbury carried a design known as \"Saxoniorum\", which had been used by Ecgberht for one of his own issues. This was replaced by a portrait design in about 843, which can be subdivided further; the earliest coins have cruder designs than the later ones. At the Rochester mint, the sequence was reversed, with an initial portrait design replaced, also in about 843, by a non-portrait design carrying a cross-and-wedges pattern on the obverse.\nIn about 848, both mints switched to a common design known as Dor\u00afb\u00af/Cant\u00a0\u2013 the characters \"Dor\u00afb\u00af\" on the obverse of these coins indicate either \"Dorobernia\" (Canterbury) or \"Dorobrevia\" (Rochester), and \"Cant\", referring to Kent, appeared on the reverse. It is possible that the Canterbury mint continued to produce portrait coins at the same time. The Canterbury issue seems to have been ended in 850\u2013851 by Viking raids, though it is possible that Rochester was spared, and the issue may have continued there. The final issue, again at both mints, was introduced in about 852; it has an inscribed cross on the reverse and a portrait on the obverse. \u00c6thelwulf's coinage became debased by the end of his reign, and though the problem became worse after his death it is possible that the debasement prompted the changes in coin type from as early as 850.\n\u00c6thelwulf's first Rochester coinage may have begun when he was still sub-king of Kent, under Ecgberht. A hoard of coins deposited at the beginning of \u00c6thelwulf's reign in about 840, found in the Middle Temple in London, contained 22 coins from Rochester and two from Canterbury of the first issue of each mint. Some numismatists argue that the high proportion of Rochester coins means that the issue must have commenced before Ecgberht's death, but an alternative explanation is that whoever hoarded the coins simply happened to have access to more Rochester coins. No coins were issued by \u00c6thelwulf's sons during his reign.\nCeolnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury throughout \u00c6thelwulf's reign, also minted coins of his own at Canterbury: there were three different portrait designs, thought to be contemporary with each of the first three of \u00c6thelwulf's Canterbury issues. These were followed by an inscribed cross design that was uniform with \u00c6thelwulf's final coinage. At Rochester, Bishop Beornmod produced only one issue, a cross-and-wedges design which was contemporary with \u00c6thelwulf's \"Saxoniorum\" issue.\nIn the view of the numismatists Philip Grierson and Mark Blackburn, the mints of Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia were not greatly affected by changes in political control: \"the remarkable continuity of moneyers which can be seen at each of these mints suggests that the actual mint organisation was largely independent of the royal administration and was founded in the stable trading communities of each city\".\nDecimation Charters.\nThe early 20th-century historian W. H. Stevenson observed that: \"Few things in our early history have led to so much discussion\" as \u00c6thelwulf's Decimation Charters; a hundred years later the charter expert Susan Kelly described them as \"one of the most controversial groups of Anglo-Saxon diplomas\". Both Asser and the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" say that \u00c6thelwulf gave a decimation, in 855, shortly before leaving on pilgrimage to Rome. According to the \"Chronicle\" \"King \u00c6thelwulf conveyed by charter the tenth part of his land throughout all his kingdom to the praise of God and to his own eternal salvation\". However, Asser states that \"\u00c6thelwulf, the esteemed king, freed the tenth part of his whole kingdom from royal service and tribute, and as an everlasting inheritance he made it over on the cross of Christ to the triune God, for the redemption of his soul and those of his predecessors.\" According to Keynes, Asser's version may just be a \"loose translation\" of the \"Chronicle\", and his implication that \u00c6thelwulf released a tenth of all land from secular burdens was probably not intended. All land could be regarded as the king's land, so the \"Chronicle\" reference to \"his land\" does not necessarily refer to royal property, and since the booking of land\u00a0\u2013 conveying it by charter\u00a0\u2013 was always regarded as a pious act, Asser's statement that he made it over to God does not necessarily mean that the charters were in favour of the church.\nThe Decimation Charters are divided by Susan Kelly into four groups:\nNone of the charters are original, and Stevenson dismissed all of them as fraudulent apart from the Kentish one of 855. Stevenson saw the decimation as a donation of royal demesne to churches and laymen, with those grants which were made to laymen being on the understanding that there would be reversion to a religious institution. Up to the 1990s, his view on the authenticity of the charters was generally accepted by scholars, except the historian H. P. R. Finberg, who argued in 1964 that most are based on authentic diplomas. Finberg coined the terms the 'First Decimation' of 844, which he saw as the removal of public dues on a tenth of all bookland, and the 'Second Decimation' of 854, the donation of a tenth of \"the private domain of the royal house\" to the churches. He considered it unlikely that the First Decimation had been carried into effect, probably due to the threat from the Vikings. Finberg's terminology has been adopted, but his defence of the First Decimation is generally rejected. In 1994, Keynes defended the Wilton charters in group 2, and his arguments have been widely accepted.\nHistorians have been divided on how to interpret the Second Decimation, and in 1994, Keynes described it as \"one of the most perplexing problems\" in the study of 9th-century charters. He set out three alternatives:\nSome scholars, for example Frank Stenton, author of the standard history of Anglo-Saxon England, along with Keynes and Abels, see the Second Decimation as a donation of royal demesne. In Abels' view, \u00c6thelwulf sought loyalty from the aristocracy and church during the king's forthcoming absence from Wessex, and displayed a sense of dynastic insecurity also evident in his father's generosity towards the Kentish church in 838, and an \"avid attention\" in this period to compiling and revising royal genealogies. Keynes suggests that \"\u00c6thelwulf's purpose was presumably to earn divine assistance in his struggles against the Vikings\", and the mid-20th-century historian Eric John observes that \"a lifetime of medieval studies teaches one that an early medieval king was never so political as when he was on his knees\". The view that the decimation was a donation of the king's own personal estate is supported by the Anglo-Saxonist Alfred P. Smyth, who argues that these were the only lands the king was entitled to alienate by book. The historian Martin Ryan prefers the view that \u00c6thelwulf freed a tenth part of the land owned by laymen from secular obligations, who could now endow churches under their own patronage. Ryan sees it as part of a campaign of religious devotion. According to the historian David Pratt, it \"is best interpreted as a strategic 'tax cut', designed to encourage cooperation in defensive measures through a partial remission of royal dues\". Nelson states that the decimation took place in two phases, in Wessex in 854 and Kent in 855, reflecting that they remained separate kingdoms.\nKelly argues that most charters were based on genuine originals, including the First Decimation of 844. She says: \"Commentators have been unkind\u00a0[and] the 844 version has not been given the benefit of the doubt\". In her view, \u00c6thelwulf then gave a 10% tax reduction on bookland, and ten years later he took the more generous step of \"a widespread distribution of royal lands\". Unlike Finberg, she believes that both decimations were carried out, although the second one may not have been completed due to opposition from \u00c6thelwulf's son \u00c6thelbald. She thinks that the grants of bookland to laymen in the Second Decimation were unconditional, not with reversion to religious houses as Stevenson had argued. However, Keynes is not convinced by Kelly's arguments, and thinks that the First Decimation charters were 11th or early 12th century fabrications.\nPilgrimage to Rome and later life.\nIn 855, \u00c6thelwulf went on a pilgrimage to Rome. According to Abels: \"\u00c6thelwulf was at the height of his power and prestige. It was a propitious time for the West Saxon king to claim a place of honour among the kings and emperors of christendom.\" His eldest surviving sons \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht were then adults, while \u00c6thelred and Alfred were still young children. In 853 \u00c6thelwulf sent his younger sons to Rome, perhaps accompanying envoys in connection with his own forthcoming visit. Alfred, and probably \u00c6thelred as well, were invested with the \"belt of consulship\". \u00c6thelred's part in the journey is only known from a contemporary record in the \"liber vitae\" of San Salvatore, Brescia, as later records such as the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" were only interested in recording the honour paid to Alfred. Abels see the embassy as paving the way for \u00c6thelwulf's pilgrimage, and the presence of Alfred, his youngest and therefore most expendable son, as a gesture of goodwill to the papacy; confirmation by Pope Leo IV made Alfred his spiritual son, and thus created a spiritual link between the two \"fathers\". Kirby argues that the journey may indicate that Alfred was intended for the church, while Nelson, on the contrary, sees \u00c6thelwulf's purpose as affirming his younger sons' throneworthiness, thus protecting them against being tonsured by their elder brothers, which would have rendered them ineligible for kingship.\n\u00c6thelwulf set out for Rome in the spring of 855, accompanied by Alfred and a large retinue. The King left Wessex in the care of his oldest surviving son, \u00c6thelbald, and the sub-kingdom of Kent to the rule of \u00c6thelberht, and thereby confirmed that they were to succeed to the two kingdoms. On the way the party stayed with Charles the Bald in Francia, where there were the usual banquets and exchange of gifts. \u00c6thelwulf stayed a year in Rome, and his gifts to the Diocese of Rome included a gold crown weighing , two gold goblets, a sword bound with gold, four silver-gilt bowls, two silk tunics and two gold-interwoven veils. He also gave gold to the clergy and leading men and silver to the people of Rome. According to the historian Joanna Story, his gifts rivalled those of Carolingian donors and the Byzantine emperor and \"were clearly chosen to reflect the personal generosity and spiritual wealth of the West Saxon king; here was no Germanic \"hillbilly\" from the backwoods of the Christian world but, rather, a sophisticated, wealthy and utterly contemporary monarch\". The post-Conquest chronicler William of Malmesbury stated that he helped to pay for the restoration of the Saxon quarter, which had recently been destroyed by fire, for English pilgrims.\nThe pilgrimage puzzles historians and Kelly comments that \"it is extraordinary that an early medieval king could consider his position safe enough to abandon his kingdom in a time of extreme crisis\". She suggests that \u00c6thelwulf may have been motivated by a personal religious impulse. Ryan sees it as an attempt to placate the divine wrath displayed by Viking attacks, whereas Nelson thinks he aimed to enhance his prestige in dealing with the demands of his adult sons. In Kirby's view:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00c6thelwulf's journey to Rome is of great interest for it did not signify abdication and a retreat from the world as their journeys to Rome had for C\u00e6dwalla and Ine and other Anglo-Saxon kings. It was more a display of the king's international standing and a demonstration of the prestige his dynasty enjoyed in Frankish and papal circles. \nOn his way back from Rome \u00c6thelwulf again stayed with King Charles the Bald, and may have joined him on a campaign against a Viking warband. On 1 October 856, \u00c6thelwulf married Charles's daughter, Judith, aged 12 or 13, at Verberie. The marriage was considered extraordinary by contemporaries and by modern historians. Carolingian princesses rarely married and were usually sent to nunneries, and it was almost unknown for them to marry foreigners. Judith was crowned queen and anointed by Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims. Although empresses had been anointed before, this is the first definitely known anointing of a Carolingian queen. In addition, West Saxon custom, described by Asser as \"perverse and detestable\", was that the wife of a king of Wessex could not be called queen or sit on the throne with her husband\u00a0\u2013 she was just the king's wife.\n\u00c6thelwulf returned to Wessex to face a revolt by \u00c6thelbald, who attempted to prevent his father from recovering his throne. Historians give varying explanations for both the rebellion and the marriage. In Nelson's view, \u00c6thelwulf's marriage to Judith added the West Saxon king to the family of kings and princely allies which Charles was creating. Charles was under attack both from Vikings and from a rising among his own nobility, and \u00c6thelwulf had great prestige due to his victories over the Vikings; some historians such as Kirby and Pauline Stafford see the marriage as sealing an anti-Viking alliance. The marriage gave \u00c6thelwulf a share in Carolingian prestige, and Kirby describes the anointing of Judith as \"a charismatic sanctification which enhanced her status, blessed her womb and conferred additional throne-worthiness on her male offspring.\" These marks of a special status implied that a son of hers would succeed to at least part of \u00c6thelwulf's kingdom, and explain \u00c6thelbald's decision to rebel. The historian Michael Enright denies that an anti-Viking alliance between two such distant kingdoms could serve any useful purpose, and argues that the marriage was \u00c6thelwulf's response to news that his son was planning to rebel; his son by an anointed Carolingian queen would be in a strong position to succeed as king of Wessex instead of the rebellious \u00c6thelbald. Abels suggests that \u00c6thelwulf sought Judith's hand because he needed her father's money and support to overcome his son's rebellion, but Kirby and Smyth argue that it is extremely unlikely that Charles the Bald would have agreed to marry his daughter to a ruler who was known to be in serious political difficulty. \u00c6thelbald may also have acted out of resentment at the loss of patrimony he suffered as a result of the decimation.\n\u00c6thelbald's rebellion was supported by Ealhstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, ealdorman of Somerset, even though they appear to have been two of the king's most trusted advisers. According to Asser, the plot was concerted \"in the western part of Selwood\", and western nobles may have backed \u00c6thelbald because they resented the patronage \u00c6thelwulf gave to eastern Wessex. Asser also stated that \u00c6thelwulf agreed to give up the western part of his kingdom in order to avoid a civil war. Some historians such as Keynes and Abels think that his rule was then confined to the south-east, while others such as Kirby think it is more likely that it was Wessex itself which was divided, with \u00c6thelbald keeping Wessex west of Selwood, \u00c6thelwulf holding the centre and east, and \u00c6thelberht keeping the south-east. \u00c6thelwulf insisted that Judith should sit beside him on the throne until the end of his life, and according to Asser, this was \"without any disagreement or dissatisfaction on the part of his nobles\".\nKing \u00c6thelwulf's ring.\nKing \u00c6thelwulf's ring was found in a cart rut in Laverstock in Wiltshire in about August 1780 by one William Petty, who sold it to a silversmith in Salisbury. The silversmith sold it to the Earl of Radnor, and the earl's son, William, donated it to the British Museum in 1829. The ring, together with a similar ring of \u00c6thelwulf's daughter \u00c6thelswith, is one of two key examples of nielloed 9th-century metalwork. They appear to represent the emergence of a \"court style\" of West Saxon metalwork, characterised by an unusual Christian iconography, such as a pair of peacocks at the Fountain of Life on the \u00c6thelwulf ring, associated with Christian immortality. The ring is inscribed \"\u00c6thelwulf Rex\", firmly associating it with the King, and the inscription forms part of the design, so it cannot have been added later. Many of its features are typical of 9th-century metalwork, such as the design of two birds, beaded and speckled borders, and a saltire with arrow-like terminals on the back. It was probably manufactured in Wessex but was typical of the uniformity of animal ornament in England in the 9th century. In the view of Leslie Webster, an expert on medieval art: \"Its fine Trewhiddle style ornament would certainly fit a mid ninth-century date.\" In Nelson's view, \"it was surely made to be a gift from this royal lord to a brawny follower: the sign of a successful ninth-century kingship\". The art historian David Wilson sees it as a survival of the pagan tradition of the generous king as the \"ring-giver\".\n\u00c6thelwulf's will.\n\u00c6thelwulf's will has not survived, but Alfred's has and it provides some information about his father's intentions. He left a bequest to be inherited by whichever of \u00c6thelbald, \u00c6thelred, and Alfred lived longest. Abels and Yorke argue that this meant the whole of his personal property in Wessex, and probably that the survivor was to inherit the throne of Wessex as well, while \u00c6thelberht and his heirs ruled Kent. Other historians disagree. Nelson states that the provision regarding the personal property had nothing to do with the kingship, and Kirby comments: \"Such an arrangement would have led to fratricidal strife. With three older brothers, Alfred's chances of reaching adulthood would, one feels, have been minimal.\" Smyth describes the bequest as a provision for his youngest sons when they reached manhood. \u00c6thelwulf's moveable wealth, such as gold and silver, was to be divided among \"children, nobles and the needs of the king's soul\". For the latter, he left one tenth of his hereditary land to be set aside to feed the poor, and he ordered that three hundred mancuses be sent to Rome each year, one hundred to be spent on lighting the lamps in St Peter's at Easter, one hundred for the lights of St Paul's, and one hundred for the pope.\nDeath and succession.\n\u00c6thelwulf died on 13 January 858. According to the \"Annals of St Neots\", he was buried at Steyning in Sussex, but his body was later transferred to Winchester, probably by Alfred. As \u00c6thelwulf had intended, he was succeeded by \u00c6thelbald in Wessex and \u00c6thelberht in Kent and the south-east. The prestige conferred by a Frankish marriage was so great that \u00c6thelbald then wedded his step-mother, Judith, to Asser's retrospective horror; he described the marriage as a \"great disgrace\", and \"against God's prohibition and Christian dignity\". When \u00c6thelbald died only two years later, \u00c6thelberht became King of Wessex as well as Kent, and \u00c6thelwulf's intention of dividing his kingdoms between his sons was thus set aside. In the view of Yorke and Abels, this was because \u00c6thelred and Alfred were too young to rule, and \u00c6thelberht agreed in return that his younger brothers would inherit the whole kingdom on his death, whereas Kirby and Nelson think that \u00c6thelberht just became the trustee for his younger brothers' share of their father's bequest.\nAfter \u00c6thelbald's death, Judith sold her possessions and returned to her father, but two years later she eloped with Baldwin, Count of Flanders. In the 890s their son, also called Baldwin, married Alfred's daughter, \u00c6lfthryth.\nHistoriography.\n\u00c6thelwulf's reputation among historians was poor in the twentieth century. In 1935, the historian R. H. Hodgkin attributed his pilgrimage to Rome to \"the unpractical piety which had led him to desert his kingdom at a time of great danger\", and described his marriage to Judith as \"the folly of a man senile before his time\". To Stenton in the 1960s, he was \"a religious and unambitious man, for whom engagement in war and politics was an unwelcome consequence of rank\". One dissenter was Finberg, who in 1964 described him as \"a king whose valour in war and princely munificence recalled the figures of the heroic age\", but in 1979, Enright said: \"More than anything else he appears to have been an impractical religious enthusiast.\" Early medieval writers, especially Asser, emphasise his religiosity and his preference for consensus, seen in the concessions made to avert a civil war on his return from Rome. In Story's view, \"his legacy has been clouded by accusations of excessive piety which (to modern sensibilities at least) has seemed at odds with the demands of early medieval kingship\". In 839, an unnamed Anglo-Saxon king wrote to the Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious asking for permission to travel through his territory on the way to Rome and relating an English priest's dream which foretold disaster unless Christians abandoned their sins. This is now believed to have been an unrealised project of Ecgberht at the end of his life, but it was formerly attributed to \u00c6thelwulf, and seen as exhibiting what Story calls his reputation for \"dramatic piety\", and irresponsibility for planning to abandon his kingdom at the beginning of his reign.\nIn the twenty-first century, he is seen very differently by historians. \u00c6thelwulf is not listed in the index of Peter Hunter Blair's \"An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England\", first published in 1956, but in a new introduction to the 2003 edition, Keynes listed him among people \"who have not always been accorded the attention they might be thought to deserve\u00a0 ... for it was he, more than any other, who secured the political fortune of his people in the ninth century, and who opened up channels of communication which led through Frankish realms and across the Alps to Rome\". According to Story: \"\u00c6thelwulf acquired and cultivated a reputation both in Francia and Rome which is unparalleled in the sources since the height of Offa's and Coenwulf's power at the turn of the ninth century\".\nNelson describes him as \"one of the great underrated among Anglo-Saxons\", and complains that she was only allowed 2,500 words for him in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", compared with 15,000 for Edward II and 35,000 for Elizabeth I. She says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00c6thelwulf's reign has been relatively under-appreciated in modern scholarship. Yet he laid the foundations for Alfred's success. To the perennial problems of husbanding the kingdom's resources, containing conflicts within the royal family, and managing relations with neighbouring kingdoms, \u00c6thelwulf found new as well as traditional answers. He consolidated old Wessex and extended his reach over what is now Devon and Cornwall. He ruled Kent, working with the grain of its political community. He borrowed ideological props from Mercians and Franks alike, and went to Rome, not to die there, like his predecessor Ine,\u00a0... but to return, as Charlemagne had, with enhanced prestige. \u00c6thelwulf coped more effectively with Scandinavian attacks than did most contemporary rulers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is notable for being the original house of the Order of Cistercians. Today, it belongs to the Trappists (also called the Cistercians of the Strict Observance).\nThe abbey has about 35 monks. The community produces a cheese branded under the abbey's name, as well as caramels and honey-based candies.\nHistory.\nC\u00eeteaux Abbey was founded on Saint Benedict's Day, 21 March 1098, by a group of monks from Molesme Abbey seeking to follow more closely the Rule of St. Benedict. The Abbey was supported by Renaud, Vicomte de Beaune, and Odo I, Duke of Burgundy. They were led by Saint Robert of Molesme, who became the first abbot. The site was wooded and swampy, in a sparsely populated area. The toponym predates the abbey, but its origin is uncertain. Theories include a derivation from \"cis tertium\" [\"lapidem miliarium\"], \"this side of the third (milestone)\" of the Roman road connecting Langres and Chalons sur Sa\u00f4ne, or alternatively from \"cisternae\" \"cisterns\", which in Middle Latin could refer to stagnant pools of a swamp.\nIn the year 1111, the monastery produced the illuminated manuscript now known as the C\u00eeteaux \"Moralia in Job\".\nThe second abbot was Saint Alberic, and the third abbot Saint Stephen Harding, who wrote the \"Carta Caritatis\" that described the organisation of the order. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who would later be proclaimed Doctor of the Church, was a monk of C\u00eeteaux Abbey and was sent in 1115 to found Clairvaux Abbey, of which he became the first abbot. Saint Bernard was influential in the exponential growth of the Cistercian Order that followed.\nThe great church of C\u00eeteaux Abbey, begun in around 1140, was completed in 1193. The Dukes of Burgundy subsequently used it as their dynastic place of burial. Other dignitaries were buried in side chapels, perhaps most famously the magnificent tomb of Philippe Pot, a high Burgundian official who died in 1493.\nBy the beginning of the 13th century the order had more than 500 houses and C\u00eeteaux became an important center of Christianity. In 1244, King Louis IX of France (Saint Louis) and his mother Blanche of Castile visited the abbey.\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, the monastery was pillaged in 1360 (the monks sought refuge in Dijon), in 1365, 1434 and 1438. In 1380, the Earl of Buckingham stayed at L'Aum\u00f4ne Abbey, a daughter house of C\u00eeteaux located in the forest of Marchenoir whilst his army was quartered in the surrounding Forest.\nThe modern era.\nSince C\u00eeteaux, the head of the order, had to meet extraordinary demands above and beyond those of other Cistercian abbeys, its campus was different. There had to be accommodations for the delegates of the annual chapter, their entourages and horses, but also for the ducal family. These obligations had an impact on the development of the abbey's infrastructure.\nTo the north, the abbey's gatehouse opened onto a first courtyard, the so-called \"lower courtyard,\" which was flanked by large buildings for guests and pilgrims. At its southern end there was a second gate, the upper floor of which was reserved for the accommodation of the Duchesses of Burgundy. It opened onto a large courtyard of honor, which in turn led to the residence of the Dukes of Burgundy. This courtyard also included buildings that were only used during the General Chapter.\nIn the beginning of the 16th century, the abbey had a strong community of about 200 members. However, it suffered badly in the French Wars of Religion and slowly declined for the next century. in 1589, soldiers stormed and looted the abbey, reportedly carrying away \"three hundred wagonloads of booty\" and leaving the monastery in ruins. C\u00eeteaux was left \"practically abandoned for years,\" and it took until around 1610 for any sort of stable monastic life to be re-established there.\nIn 1698, the abbey had 72 professed monks. In 1790, in the wake of the French Revolution, the monks were offered a pension if they agreed to return to civilian life. Fourteen of them, including Abbot Francois Trouv\u00e9, refused the offer, while twenty-nine took it. The abbey was seized and the property sold off by the government; what was left was looted by the local population. To calm the ensuing violence, a minor squad under the direction of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte was called in.\nPenitentiary colony.\nThe C\u00eeteaux Abbey see the establishment in 1846 of the agricultural penitentiary colony led by Father Joseph Rey. The colony was intended to detain minors and teach them a trade. The educational methods were similar to military methods, and from 1883, reports revealed poor hygiene, nutrition, and teaching conditions, and the Ministry of the Interior no longer sent prisoners to this colony. They would henceforth be entrusted to public colonies. The scandal of 1888, brought up before the National Assembly, led to the withdrawal of recognition of public utility from the Society of the Brothers of St Joseph. This lasted until 1895. The C\u00eeteaux estate then passed into state hands. C\u00eeteaux became a monastery again in 1898, when the Trappist monks settled there.\nThe rebirth of the Abbey.\nTrappist monks resumed monastic life at the abbey in 1898, and they continue to reside there. The first monks, four in number, arrived from Sept-Fons on 2 October 1898. In 1913, the abbey had around twenty-five people, monks and lay brothers, and was facing financial difficulties. The commercial production of cheese began around this time. In 1998, the celebration of the 9th centenary of the founding of C\u00eeteaux was marked by the renovation of the church.\nRestoration work.\nThe abbey has preserved three buildings from the ancient period. The oldest, the library, completed in 1509, with a ribbed vault. The \"D\u00e9finitoire\", with a groin vault, which includes several rooms including a large one with central columns, and the dormitory on the upper floor and finally the last building, called the Lenoir building, completed in 1771. These three buildings were classified as historic monuments by decree of December 28, 1978. Between 1824 and 1839, transformations were carried out to adapt the building to the needs of a sugar mill.\nA rehabilitation and restoration project, supported by the Congr\u00e9gation de C\u00eeteaux and the international association C\u00eeteaux Mater Nostra, was initiated on the basis of a programming study carried out in 2019 by the Archipat agency.\nFilm set.\nIn 2018, a team from the TV programme Secrets d'Histoire filmed several sequences at the abbey as part of an episode devoted to Blanche of Castile, entitled , broadcast on 5 July 2018 on France 2 channel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The duty officer of the base tasked with retrieving the satellite suspects it returned with an extraterrestrial contaminant and recommends activating \"Wildfire\", a protocol for a government-sponsored team of scientists intended to contain threats of this nature.\nThe Wildfire team, led by Dr. Jeremy Stone, believes that the satellite\u2014intentionally designed to capture upper-atmosphere microorganisms for bio-weapon exploitation\u2014returned with a deadly microorganism that kills through nearly instantaneous blood clotting. Upon investigating Piedmont, the team discovers the townspeople either died in mid-stride or went \"quietly nuts\" and committed bizarre suicides. Two survivors\u2014the sick, Sterno-addicted, geriatric Peter Jackson and the constantly bawling infant Jamie Ritter\u2014are biological opposites who somehow survived the organism.\nJackson, Ritter, and the satellite are taken to the secret underground Wildfire laboratory, a secure facility equipped with every known capacity for protection against microorganisms escaping into the environment. Wildfire is hidden in a remote area near Flatrock, Nevada, from Las Vegas, concealed in the sub-basements of a legitimate Department of Agriculture research station. Dr. Mark Hall is the only scientist authorized to disarm the automatic self-destruct mechanism; he is an unmarried, childless male and thus presumed to make the most dispassionate decisions during a crisis.\nFurther investigation determined that the deaths were caused by an extraterrestrial microbe transported by a meteor that crashed into the satellite, knocking it from orbit. The microbe contains chemical elements required for terrestrial life (CHNOPS) and appears to have a crystalline structure, but lacks the DNA, RNA, proteins, and amino acids present in terrestrial life, and directly transforms energy to matter with no discernible byproducts. The microbe, code-named \"Andromeda\", mutates with each growth cycle, changing its biological properties.\nThe scientists learned that the current form of Andromeda grows only in a narrow pH range; in a too-acidic or too alkaline growth medium, the organism will not divide. Andromeda's ideal pH range is 7.39\u20137.43, within the range found in normal human blood. Jackson and Ritter survived because both had abnormal blood pH (Jackson acidotic from consumption of Sterno and aspirin, Ritter alkalotic from hyperventilation). However, by the time the scientists realize this, Andromeda has mutated into a form that degrades the lab's plastic seals and escapes containment. Trapped in a contaminated lab, Dr. Charles Burton demands that Stone inject him with a \"universal antibiotic\"; Stone refuses, arguing that it would render Burton too vulnerable to infection by other harmful bacteria. Burton survives because the mutated Andromeda is no longer pathogenic.\nThe mutated Andromeda attacks the plastic door and hatch seals within the Wildfire facility, rapidly migrating toward the upper levels and the surface. The self-destruct nuclear weapon is automatically armed when it detects the containment breach, triggering its detonation countdown to prevent the spread of the infection. As the bomb arms, the scientists realize that given Andromeda's ability to generate matter directly from energy, the organism would be able to consume the released energy and ultimately benefit from a nuclear explosion, mutating in thousands of ways, potentially \"each killing in a different way\".\nTo halt the detonation, Hall must insert a special key he carries into an emergency substation, one of which should be accessible from any location in Wildfire. Unfortunately, he is trapped in a section that, due to an oversight, has no substation. He must navigate Wildfire's obstacle course of automatic defenses to reach a working substation on an upper level. He barely disarms the bomb before all the air is evacuated from the deepest level of the Wildfire complex, which contains the remainder of the team and their assistants. Andromeda is suspected to have eventually mutated into a benign, anaerobic form and migrated to the upper atmosphere, where the oxygen content is lower, better suiting its growth.\nThe novel's epilogue reveals that a crewed spacecraft, \"Andros V\", was incinerated during atmospheric re-entry, presumably because Andromeda had eaten its tungsten/plastic laminate heat shield and caused it to burn up.\nBackground.\nCrichton was inspired to write the novel after reading \"The IPCRESS File\" by Len Deighton while studying in the UK. Crichton says he was \"terrifically impressed\" by the book\u2014\"a lot of \"Andromeda\" is traceable to \"Ipcress\" in terms of trying to create an imaginary world using recogniseable techniques and real people.\" He wrote the novel over three years.\nOdd-man hypothesis.\nThe \"odd-man hypothesis\" is a hypothesis that states that unmarried men are better able to execute the best, most dispassionate decisions in crises\u2014in this case, to disarm the nuclear weapon intended to prevent the escape of organisms from the laboratory in the event the auto-destruct sequence is initiated. In the novel, the odd-man explanation is a page in a Hudson Institute report of the results of test series wherein different people were to make command decisions in nuclear and biological wars and chemical crises.\nHall is briefed on the hypothesis after his arrival at Wildfire. In the book, his copy of the briefing materials has the hypothesis pages removed; in the film, he is criticized for failure to read the material beforehand.\nDr. Hall is assumed to have the highest \"command decision effectiveness index\" among the Wildfire team; this is the reason why he is given a control key to the self-destruct mechanism. Hall initially derides this idea, saying that he has no intention of committing suicide before he is told that it is his job to \"disarm\" the weapon, rather than to \"arm\" it: Stone then admits that the odd-man hypothesis, while accurate (in the confines of the book), was essentially a false document used to justify handing over a nuclear weapon to private individuals and out of government control.\nAdaptations.\nIn 1971, \"The Andromeda Strain\" was the basis for the film of the same name directed by Robert Wise, and featuring Arthur Hill as Stone, James Olson as Hall, Kate Reid as Leavitt (changed to a female character, Ruth Leavitt), and David Wayne as Dutton (Burton in the novel).\nIn 2008, \"The Andromeda Strain\" was the basis for an eponymous miniseries executive-produced by Ridley and Tony Scott and Frank Darabont, and featuring Benjamin Bratt as Stone. Other characters' names and personalities were radically changed from the novel.\nReception.\nReviews for \"The Andromeda Strain\" were overwhelmingly positive, and the novel was an American bestseller, establishing Michael Crichton as a respected novelist and science-fiction writer. \"The Andromeda Strain\" is one of the books credited with creating the techno-thriller genre.\n\"The Pittsburgh Press\" said it was \"relentlessly suspenseful... A hair-raising experience.\" The \"Detroit Free Press\" called it \"Hideously plausible suspense... will glue you to your chair.\" \"Library Journal\" said \"The Andromeda Strain\" was \"One of the most important novels of the year\".\n\"The New York Times\"'s Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said, \"Tired out by a long day in the country, I was awake way past bedtime. My arms were numb from propping up my head. By turning from side to side, I had driven the cats from their place at the foot of the bed, and they were disgruntled. I was very likely disturbing my wife's sleep. But I was well into Michael Crichton's \"The Andromeda Strain\". And he had me convinced it was all really happening.\"\nSequel.\nA sequel titled \"The Andromeda Evolution\" written by Daniel H. Wilson was published on November 12, 2019. Crichton's name still appears on the cover in large print, despite the book being written after his death.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the definite article in English. \"The\" is the most frequently used word in the English language; studies and analyses of texts have found it to account for seven percent of all printed English-language words. It is derived from gendered articles in Old English which combined in Middle English and now has a single form used with nouns of any gender. The word can be used with both singular and plural nouns, and with a noun that starts with any letter. This is different from many other languages, which have different forms of the definite article for different genders or numbers.\nPronunciation.\nIn most dialects, \"the\" is pronounced as (with the voiced dental fricative followed by a schwa) when followed by a consonant sound, and as (homophone of the archaic pronoun \"thee\") when followed by a vowel sound or used as an emphatic form.\nModern American and New Zealand English have an increasing tendency to limit usage of pronunciation and use , even before a vowel.\nSometimes the word \"the\" is pronounced , with stress, to emphasise that something is unique: \"he is the first\", not just \"one of the\" first.\nAdverbial.\nDefinite article principles in English are described under \"Use of articles\". The \"the\" of phrases like \"the more the better\" has a distinct origin and etymology and by chance has evolved to be identical to the definite article.\nArticle.\n\"The\" and \"that\" are common developments from the same Old English system. Old English had a definite article (in the masculine gender), (feminine), and (neuter). In Middle English, these had all merged into , the ancestor of the Modern English word \"the\".\n\"Ye\" form.\nIn Middle English, the digraph \u27e8th\u27e9 was written using the letter thorn, \u00fe. During the latter Middle English and Early Modern English periods, thorn (in its common script or cursive form), came to resemble a \"y\" shape. With the arrival of movable type printing, the substitution of \u27e8y\u27e9 for \u27e8\u00de\u27e9 became ubiquitous, leading to the common \"ye\", as in 'Ye Olde Curiositie Shoppe'. One major reason for this was that \u27e8y\u27e9 existed in the printer's types that William Caxton and his contemporaries imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, while \u27e8\u00de\u27e9 did not. Historically, the article was never pronounced with a \"y\" sound even when it was so written.\nThe word \"\u00fee\" (\"the\") was frequently written as \u00fe\u0364, a \u27e8\u00fe\u27e9 with a small \u27e8e\u27e9 above it. (Similarly, \"\u00feat\" (modern \"that\") was abbreviated using a \u27e8\u00fe\u27e9 with a small \u27e8t\u27e9 above it, as can be seen in the sample illustrated here.) As a result of the \u27e8y\u27e9 for \u27e8\u00fe\u27e9 substitution practice, the use of a \u27e8y\u27e9 with an \u27e8e\u27e9 above it (y\u0364,) style became common. It can still be seen in reprints of the 1611 edition of the King James Version of the Bible (in places such as Romans 15:29) or in the Mayflower Compact.\nGeographic usage.\nAn area in which the use or non-use of \"the\" is sometimes problematic is with geographic names:\nCountries and territorial regions are notably mixed, most exclude \"the\" but there are some that adhere to secondary rules:\nTrademark.\nOhio State University registered a trademark allowing the university to use \"THE\" on casual and athletic clothing. The university, often referred to as \"The Ohio State University\", had used \"THE\" on clothing since 2005, but took steps to register the trademark in August 2019 after the Marc Jacobs company attempted to do the same. In August 2021 Ohio State and Marc Jacobs agreed the high-end fashion retailer could use \"THE\" on its merchandise, which was different from what the university would sell. Still, the university took almost an additional year to convince the United States Patent and Trademark Office that the use of \"the\" was \"more than ... ornamental\".\nAbbreviations.\nThe word \"The\" itself, capitalised, is used as an abbreviation in Commonwealth countries for the honorific title \"The Right Honourable\", as in e.g. \"The Earl Mountbatten of Burma\", short for \"The Right Honourable Earl Mountbatten of Burma\", or \"The Prince Charles\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The three areas are closely interrelated. AMO theory includes classical, semi-classical and quantum treatments. Typically, the theory and applications of emission, absorption, scattering of electromagnetic radiation (light) from excited atoms and molecules, analysis of spectroscopy, generation of lasers and masers, and the optical properties of matter in general, fall into these categories.\nAtomic and molecular physics.\nAtomic physics is the subfield of AMO that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus, while molecular physics is the study of the physical properties of molecules. The term \"atomic physics\" is often associated with nuclear power and nuclear bombs, due to the synonymous use of \"atomic\" and \"nuclear\" in standard English. However, physicists distinguish between atomic physics \u2014 which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons \u2014 and nuclear physics, which considers atomic nuclei alone. While nuclear physicists concern themselves primarily with techniques to investigate atomic nuclei like particle accelerators, AMO physicists tend to be more interested in techniques in spectroscopy. Within AMO physics, many are interested in the study of Molecular physics. Although this field is related to atomic physics, there are also additional degrees of freedom that create more complicated Hamiltonians with interesting underlying physics. Molecular physics also has siginificant overlap with the fields of theoretical chemistry, physical chemistry and chemical physics.\nBoth subfields are primarily concerned with electronic structure and the dynamical processes by which these arrangements change. The way that this is studied is by characterizing the system's Hamiltonian and understanding the energy levels of the system. Understanding the dynamics of these systems, particularly for molecules, is known as quantum chemistry. To probe the structure of these atoms and molecules, physicists use atomic orbital and molecular orbital theory to understand the electronic structure. Notably in molecular physics, understanding the electronic properities of your respective molecule will tell you the leading order effect in the energy contribution in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation of a molecules Hamiltonian. \nMolecular physics is concerned with atomic processes in molecules, but it is also concerned with effects due to the molecular structure. In addition to the electronic excitation states which are known from atoms, molecules are able to rotate and to vibrate. These rotations and vibrations are quantized; there are discrete energy levels. The smallest energy differences exist between different rotational states, therefore pure rotational spectra are in the far infrared region (about 30 - 150 \u03bcm wavelength) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Vibrational spectra are in the near infrared (about 1 - 5\u00a0\u03bcm) and spectra resulting from electronic transitions are mostly in the visible and ultraviolet regions. From measuring rotational and vibrational spectra properties of molecules like the distance between the nuclei can be calculated.\nAs with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of \"atomic, molecular, and optical physics\". Physics research groups are usually so classified.\nOptical physics.\nOptical physics is the study of the generation of electromagnetic radiation, the properties of that radiation, and the interaction of that radiation with matter, especially its manipulation and control. It differs from general optics and optical engineering in that it is focused on the discovery and application of new phenomena. There is no strong distinction, however, between optical physics, applied optics, and optical engineering, since the devices of optical engineering and the applications of applied optics are necessary for basic research in optical physics, and that research leads to the development of new devices and applications. Often the same people are involved in both the basic research and the applied technology development, for example the experimental demonstration of electromagnetically induced transparency by S. E. Harris and of slow light by Harris and Lene Vestergaard Hau.\nResearchers in optical physics use and develop light sources that span the electromagnetic spectrum from microwaves to X-rays. The field includes the generation and detection of light, linear and nonlinear optical processes, and spectroscopy. Lasers and laser spectroscopy have transformed optical science. Major study in optical physics is also devoted to quantum optics and coherence, and to femtosecond optics. In optical physics, support is also provided in areas such as the nonlinear response of isolated atoms to intense, ultra-short electromagnetic fields, the atom-cavity interaction at high fields, and quantum properties of the electromagnetic field.\nOther important areas of research include the development of novel optical techniques for nano-optical measurements, diffractive optics, low-coherence interferometry, optical coherence tomography, and near-field microscopy. Research in optical physics places an emphasis on ultrafast optical science and technology. The applications of optical physics create advancements in communications, medicine, manufacturing, and even entertainment.\nHistory.\nOne of the earliest steps towards \"atomic physics\" was the recognition that matter was composed of \"atoms\", in modern terms the basic unit of a chemical element. This theory was developed by John Dalton in the 18th century. At this stage, it wasn't clear what atoms were - although they could be described and classified by their observable properties in bulk; summarized by the developing periodic table, by John Newlands and Dmitri Mendeleyev around the mid to late 19th century.\nLater, the connection between atomic physics \"and\" optical physics became apparent, by the discovery of spectral lines and attempts to describe the phenomenon - notably by Joseph von Fraunhofer, Fresnel, and others in the 19th century.\nFrom that time to the 1920s, physicists were seeking to explain atomic spectra and blackbody radiation. One attempt to explain hydrogen spectral lines was the Bohr atom model.\nExperiments including electromagnetic radiation and matter - such as the photoelectric effect, Compton effect, and spectra of sunlight the due to the unknown element of Helium, the limitation of the Bohr model to Hydrogen, and numerous other reasons, lead to an entirely new mathematical model of matter and light: quantum mechanics.\nClassical oscillator model of matter.\nEarly models to explain the origin of the index of refraction treated an electron in an atomic system classically according to the model of Paul Drude and Hendrik Lorentz. The theory was developed to attempt to provide an origin for the wavelength-dependent refractive index \"n\" of a material. In this model, incident electromagnetic waves forced an electron bound to an atom to oscillate. The amplitude of the oscillation would then have a relationship to the frequency of the incident electromagnetic wave and the resonant frequencies of the oscillator. The superposition of these emitted waves from many oscillators would then lead to a wave which moved more slowly.\nEarly quantum model of matter and light.\nMax Planck derived a formula to describe the electromagnetic field inside a box when in thermal equilibrium in 1900.\nHis model consisted of a superposition of standing waves. In one dimension, the box has length \"L\", and only sinusoidal waves of wavenumber\nformula_1\ncan occur in the box, where \"n\" is a positive integer (mathematically denoted by formula_2). The equation describing these standing waves is given by:\nformula_3.\nwhere \"E\"0 is the magnitude of the electric field amplitude, and \"E\" is the magnitude of the electric field at position \"x\". From this basic, Planck's law was derived.\nIn 1911, Ernest Rutherford concluded, based on alpha particle scattering, that an atom has a central pointlike proton. He also thought that an electron would be still attracted to the proton by Coulomb's law, which he had verified still held at small scales. As a result, he believed that electrons revolved around the proton. Niels Bohr, in 1913, combined the Rutherford model of the atom with the quantisation ideas of Planck. Only specific and well-defined orbits of the electron could exist, which also do not radiate light. In jumping orbit the electron would emit or absorb light corresponding to the difference in energy of the orbits. His prediction of the energy levels was then consistent with observation.\nThese results, based on a \"discrete\" set of specific standing waves, were inconsistent with the \"continuous\" classical oscillator model.\nWork by Albert Einstein in 1905 on the photoelectric effect led to the association of a light wave of frequency formula_4 with a photon of energy formula_5. In 1917 Einstein created an extension to Bohrs model by the introduction of the three processes of stimulated emission, spontaneous emission and absorption (electromagnetic radiation).\nModern treatments.\nThe largest steps towards the modern treatment was the formulation of quantum mechanics with the matrix mechanics approach by Werner Heisenberg and the discovery of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.\nThere are a variety of semi-classical treatments within AMO. Which aspects of the problem are treated quantum mechanically and which are treated classically is dependent on the specific problem at hand. The semi-classical approach is ubiquitous in computational work within AMO, largely due to the large decrease in computational cost and complexity associated with it.\nFor matter under the action of a laser, a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the atomic or molecular system is combined with the system being under the action of a classical electromagnetic field. Since the field is treated classically it can not deal with spontaneous emission. This semi-classical treatment is valid for most systems, particular those under the action of high intensity laser fields. The distinction between optical physics and quantum optics is the use of semi-classical and fully quantum treatments respectively.\nWithin collision dynamics and using the semi-classical treatment, the internal degrees of freedom may be treated quantum mechanically, whilst the relative motion of the quantum systems under consideration are treated classically. When considering medium to high speed collisions, the nuclei can be treated classically while the electron is treated quantum mechanically. In low speed collisions the approximation fails.\nClassical Monte-Carlo methods for the dynamics of electrons can be described as semi-classical in that the initial conditions are calculated using a fully quantum treatment, but all further treatment is classical.\nIsolated atoms and molecules.\nAtomic, Molecular and Optical physics frequently considers atoms and molecules in isolation. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons, whilst molecular models are typically concerned with molecular hydrogen and its molecular hydrogen ion. It is concerned with processes such as ionization, above threshold ionization and excitation by photons or collisions with atomic particles.\nWhile modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers molecules in a gas or plasma then the time-scales for molecule-molecule interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic and molecular processes that we are concerned with. This means that the individual molecules can be treated as if each were in isolation for the vast majority of the time. By this consideration atomic and molecular physics provides the underlying theory in plasma physics and atmospheric physics even though both deal with huge numbers of molecules.\nElectronic configuration.\nElectrons form notional shells around the nucleus. These are naturally in a ground state but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light (photons), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically other electrons).\nElectrons that populate a shell are said to be in a bound state. The energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell (taking it to infinity) is called the binding energy. Any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to kinetic energy according to the conservation of energy. The atom is said to have undergone the process of ionization.\nIn the event that the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it may transition to an excited state or to a virtual state. After a statistically sufficient quantity of time, an electron in an excited state will undergo a transition to a lower state via spontaneous emission. The change in energy between the two energy levels must be accounted for (conservation of energy). In a neutral atom, the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy. However, if the lower state is in an inner shell, a phenomenon known as the Auger effect may take place where the energy is transferred to another bound electrons causing it to go into the continuum. This allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.\nThere are strict selection rules as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light\u2014however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the second of five sons of King \u00c6thelwulf. In 850, \u00c6thelbald's elder brother \u00c6thelstan defeated the Vikings in the first recorded sea battle in English history, but he is not recorded afterwards and probably died in the early 850s. The next year \u00c6thelwulf and \u00c6thelbald inflicted another defeat on the Vikings at the Battle of Aclea. In 855, \u00c6thelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome and appointed \u00c6thelbald King of Wessex, while \u00c6thelberht, the next oldest son, became King of Kent, which had been conquered by Wessex thirty years earlier.\nOn his way back from Rome, \u00c6thelwulf stayed for several months with Charles the Bald, King of the West Franks, whose twelve-year-old daughter Judith he married. When he returned to England in 856, \u00c6thelbald refused to give up the crown. Most historians believe that \u00c6thelbald continued to be king of Wessex while \u00c6thelberht gave up Kent to his father, but some think that Wessex itself was divided, with \u00c6thelbald ruling the west and his father the east, while \u00c6thelberht kept Kent. When \u00c6thelwulf died in 858, \u00c6thelbald continued as (or became again) king of Wessex and his brother resumed (or carried on) his kingship of Kent.\n\u00c6thelbald married his stepmother Judith. Asser, the biographer of his youngest brother, Alfred the Great, denounced \u00c6thelbald and Judith's union as being \"against God's prohibition and Christian dignity, and also contrary to the practice of all pagans\", but the marriage does not seem to have been condemned at the time. \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht appear to have been on good terms: when \u00c6thelbald died in 860, \u00c6thelberht became king of both Wessex and Kent, and they were never again divided.\nBackground.\nWhen \u00c6thelbald's grandfather Ecgberht became king of Wessex in 802, it would have seemed very unlikely that he would establish a lasting dynasty. For two hundred years, three families had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. Ecgberht's nearest connection to a king of Wessex was as a great-great-grandson of Ingild, brother of King Ine (688\u2013726), but he was believed to be a paternal descendant of Cerdic, the founder of the West Saxon dynasty, which made him an \u00e6theling, a prince who had a legitimate claim to the throne. However, in the ninth and tenth centuries, Ecgberht's line controlled the kingdom, and all kings were sons of kings.\nAt the beginning of the ninth century, England was almost wholly under the control of the Anglo-Saxons, and the Midland kingdom of Mercia dominated southern England. In 825, Ecgberht decisively defeated the Mercians at the Battle of Ellendun, ending Mercian supremacy. The two kingdoms became allies, which was important in the resistance to Viking attacks. In 835, the Isle of Sheppey in Kent was ravaged. In 836, Ecgberht was defeated by the Vikings at Carhampton in Somerset, but in 838, he was victorious over an alliance of Cornishmen and Vikings at the Battle of Hingston Down, reducing Cornwall to the status of a client kingdom. He died in the following year and was succeeded by his son \u00c6thelwulf, who appointed his eldest son \u00c6thelstan as sub-king of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex, in the same year.\nEarly life.\n\u00c6thelbald was the second son of King \u00c6thelwulf and probably of his first wife Osburh, who was the mother of Alfred the Great. As \u00c6thelstan was old enough to be appointed king ten years before Alfred was born in 849, and \u00c6thelbald took part in the battle in 851, some historians argue that it is more likely that the elder children were born to an unrecorded earlier wife. \u00c6thelstan died before his father, but \u00c6thelbald and his three younger brothers were successively kings of Wessex: \u00c6thelbald reigned from 855 to 860, \u00c6thelberht from 860 to 865, \u00c6thelred I from 865 to 871, and Alfred the Great from 871 to 899. \u00c6thelbald is first recorded when he witnessed a charter of his father (S 290) in 840 as \"filius regis\" (the king's son). He attested with the same designation in the 840s, to S 300 in 850 as \"dux filius regis\" and in the early 850s as \"dux\" (ealdorman). In 850 his elder brother \u00c6thelstan defeated a Danish fleet off Sandwich in the first recorded naval battle in English history, but he is not recorded thereafter and probably died soon afterwards. In 851, \u00c6thelwulf and \u00c6thelbald defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Aclea and, according to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", \"we have never heard of a greater slaughter of them, in any region, on any one day, before or since\". At Easter in 854, \u00c6thelbald and his younger brother \u00c6thelberht attested charters as \"dux\", and in 855 their father went on pilgrimage to Rome and appointed \u00c6thelbald as king of Wessex while \u00c6thelberht became king of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex.\nDivision of the kingdom.\n\u00c6thelwulf spent a year in Rome. On his way back he stayed for several months with Charles the Bald, King of the West Franks, and married Charles's twelve-year-old daughter Judith, a great-granddaughter of Charlemagne; the bishop of Rheims ceremonially consecrated her and \u00c6thelwulf conferred the title of queen on her. \u00c6thelwulf returned with his new wife in October 856, and according to Alfred the Great's biographer, Bishop Asser, during his absence a plot was hatched to prevent the king's return and keep \u00c6thelbald on the throne. Asser regarded it as \"a terrible crime: expelling the king from his own kingdom; but God did not allow it to happen, nor would the nobles of the whole Saxon land have any part in it\". Asser stated that a great many men said that the initiative for \"this wretched incident, unheard of in all previous ages\" came from \u00c6thelbald's chief counsellors, Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne and Eanwulf, Ealdorman of Somerset, who had been two of \u00c6thelwulf's most senior advisers, while many blamed \u00c6thelbald himself.\nHistorians give varying explanations for both the marriage and the rebellion. D. P. Kirby and Pauline Stafford see the match as sealing an anti-Viking alliance. Another factor was Judith's descent from Charlemagne: a union with her gave \u00c6thelwulf a share in Carolingian prestige. Kirby describes her anointing as \"a charismatic sanctification which enhanced her status, blessed her womb and conferred additional throne-worthiness on her male offspring.\" These marks of a special status implied that a son of hers would succeed to at least part of \u00c6thelwulf's kingdom, and explain \u00c6thelbald's decision to rebel. He may also have feared that he would be disadvantaged if his father returned to rule Wessex while his brother kept Kent. Michael Enright argues that an alliance against the Vikings between such distant territories would have served no useful purpose. He sees the marriage as following \u00c6thelbald's rebellion and being a response to it, intending that a son of Judith would displace \u00c6thelbald as successor to the throne. Janet Nelson goes further, seeing \u00c6thelwulf's pilgrimage as intended from the start to enhance his prestige to assist him in facing down filial resentments. Kirby and Sean Miller argue that it is unlikely that Charles would have agreed to his daughter being taken to a country in a state of civil war, so \u00c6thelbald's revolt was probably a response to the marriage, which threatened to produce sons who had a stronger claim to the throne than he had. Richard Abels argues that \u00c6thelbald probably hoped that his rule would be permanent: \"All knew the dangers that attended a pilgrimage to Rome and were aware of the possibility that \u00c6thelwulf would not return. His departure to Rome all but invited the prowling of hungry \u00e6thelings.\" Charles may have agreed to the marriage because he was under attack both from Vikings and from a rising among his own nobility, and \u00c6thelwulf had great prestige due to his victories over the Vikings. The marriage added the West Saxon king to the network of royal and princely allies that Charles was creating.\nRivalry between east and west Wessex may have also been a factor in the dispute. The ancient Selwood Forest marked the boundary between the bishoprics of Sherborne in the west and Winchester in the east. In the eighth century, the connections of Ecgberht's family were with the west, but in the early ninth century, the family became close to the clergy of Winchester, who helped them to establish an exclusive hold on the throne for their royal branch. According to Asser, the plot to rob \u00c6thelwulf of his throne was concocted in \"the western part of Selwood\", and \u00c6thelbald's chief supporters, Eahlstan and Eanwulf, were western magnates who probably resented the favour shown by \u00c6thelwulf to the eastern Winchester diocese, and to Swithun, who was appointed by \u00c6thelwulf as Bishop of Winchester in 852. \u00c6thelbald's patronage was mainly directed at Sherborne.\nAsser is the sole source for the dispute between \u00c6thelwulf and \u00c6thelbald, which is not mentioned in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", and according to Asser when \u00c6thelwulf returned to England he agreed to divide the kingdom to avoid a civil war. Most historians state that \u00c6thelbald kept Wessex while \u00c6thelberht agreed to surrender the south-eastern kingdoms of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex to \u00c6thelwulf, although Simon Keynes thinks that \u00c6thelwulf kept a degree of sovereignty. Some historians argue that it is more likely that Wessex itself was divided, with \u00c6thelbald keeping his power base west of Selwood, \u00c6thelwulf taking the east and \u00c6thelberht keeping Kent. Pauline Stafford and D. P. Kirby point out that Asser implies that Judith became queen of the West Saxons in 856. Sean Miller observes that Asser complained that the \"son ruled where by rightful judgment the father should have done; for the western part of the Saxon land has always been more important than the eastern\", and since Kent had been conquered only thirty years previously, it did not make sense to speak of it as having always been a less important part of the kingdom.\nKingship.\nAccording to Asser, at the end of his life, \u00c6thelwulf directed that his kingdom should be divided between his two eldest sons, and this was carried out when he died on 13 January 858. \u00c6thelbald then continued (or resumed) as king of Wessex, while \u00c6thelberht resumed (or kept) the kingship of Kent and the south-east. \u00c6thelwulf left a bequest to \u00c6thelbald, \u00c6thelred and Alfred, with the provision that whoever lived the longest was to inherit the whole; this is seen by some historians as leaving the kingship of Wessex to the survivor, but other historians dispute this and it may have been intended to provide for the younger sons. Judith's status as both a Carolingian princess and a consecrated queen was so great that, rather than lose the prestige of her connections to Francia and to his father's reign, \u00c6thelbald decided to marry her. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" ignores the marriage, perhaps because mentioning such a prestigious connection of Alfred's older brother would have detracted from its focus on the achievements of Alfred himself. \u00c6thelbald's marriage to his widowed stepmother was subsequently condemned by Asser as \"against God's prohibition and Christian dignity, and also contrary to the practice of all pagans\", although it does not appear to have aroused opposition at the time. The Frankish \"Annals of St Bertin\" reported the marriage without comment, and stated that when she returned to her father after \u00c6thelbald's death, Judith was treated \"with all the honour due to a queen\". To her father's fury, soon afterwards she eloped with Baldwin, Count of Flanders, and their son Baldwin II married Alfred's daughter \u00c6lfthryth.\nLittle is known of \u00c6thelbald's reign and only two of his charters survive. S 1274, dated 858, is a grant by Swithun of an episcopal estate at Farnham to the king for his lifetime, and in Barbara Yorke's view it is an example of \u00c6thelbald's confiscations of the bishop of Winchester's estates for his own use. S 326, dated 860, is a grant by \u00c6thelbald of fourteen hides at Teffont in Wiltshire to a thegn called Osmund. Both are attested by Judith, an indication of her high status, as ninth-century West Saxon kings' wives were not normally given the rank of queen and almost never witnessed charters. The marriage and attestations are evidence that \u00c6thelbald intended the succession to pass to his own son, not his brothers. S 326 is also attested by King \u00c6thelberht, suggesting that he was on good terms with his brother. S 1274 is the earliest surviving West Saxon charter to require a contribution to fortification work, and Nelson suggests that Judith's entourage may have been responsible for the innovation. A few years later Charles the Bald began a programme of rebuilding town walls and building new fortresses in West Francia.\nNo coins are known to have been issued in the name of \u00c6thelbald. The main mints in southern England were both in Kent, at Canterbury and Rochester. They minted coins in the name of \u00c6thelwulf until 858 and then in the name of \u00c6thelberht. There was one mint in Wessex, probably at Southampton or Winchester, but it operated at a minimal level in the mid-ninth century and only three coins from it between 839 and 871 are known, two of \u00c6thelwulf and one of \u00c6thelred I, all produced by the same moneyer. The fact that the Kentish mints produced coins only for \u00c6thelberht between 858 and 860 is evidence that \u00c6thelbald was not his brother's overlord. Three coins of \u00c6thelbald were regarded as genuine in the late nineteenth century, but in the 1900s they were found to be forgeries.\nDeath.\n\u00c6thelbald died in 860 and the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" gives him a reign of five years, dating the start to 855 when \u00c6thelwulf left for Rome. Both Asser and the \"Annals of St Neots\" give \u00c6thelbald a rule of two and a half years, and the \"Annals\" adds that he also ruled for two and a half years jointly with his father. Most modern historians date his reign as 855 to 860, but some as 858 to 860. Only the year of his death is known, but as his father died in January 858 and he ruled for two and a half years thereafter, he probably died in about July 860. He was buried at Sherborne in Dorset and he is not known to have had any children.\nHe was succeeded by \u00c6thelberht, who re-united Wessex and Kent under his rule. It is not clear whether the division between Wessex and Kent had been intended to be permanent, but if so \u00c6thelbald's early death allowed \u00c6thelberht to reverse the division, and Kent and the south-east were thereafter treated as an integral part of Wessex.\nReputation.\nIn the 890s, Bishop Asser gave the only surviving contemporary assessment of \u00c6thelbald. Asser, who was hostile to him both because of his revolt against his father and because of his uncanonical marriage, described him as \"iniquitous and grasping\" and his reign as \"two and a half lawless years\", adding that many people attributed the rebellion \"solely to arrogance on the part of King \u00c6thelbald because he was grasping in this affair and many other wrongdoings\". Post-Conquest clerical chroniclers adopted Asser's views. William of Malmesbury wrote that \"\u00c6thelbald, who was worthless and disloyal to his father, defiled his father's marriage-bed, for after his father's death he sank so low as to marry his stepmother Judith.\" According to John of Worcester, \"\u00c6thelbald, in defiance of God's prohibition and Christian dignity, and even against all pagan customs, climbed into his father's marriage-bed, married Judith, daughter of Charles, king of the Franks, and held the government of the kingdom of the West Saxons without restraint for two and half years after his father's death\". Roger of Wendover condemned \u00c6thelbald in similar terms, but claimed that in 859 he repented of his error, put aside Judith and ruled thereafter \"in peace and righteousness\". The exception was Henry of Huntingdon, who stated that \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht, \"young men of superlative natural quality, possessed their kingdoms very prosperously as long as they each lived. When \u00c6thelbald, King of Wessex, had held his kingdom peacefully for five years, he was carried off by a premature death. All England lamented King \u00c6thelbald's youth and there was great sorrow over him. And they buried him at Sherborne. After this England was conscious of what it had lost in him.\"\nRobert Howard Hodgkin also adopted Asser's views in his 1935 \"History of the Anglo-Saxons\", but later historians have been more circumspect. Frank Stenton in \"Anglo-Saxon England\" does not give any opinion on \u00c6thelbald, and observes that his marriage to Judith does not appear to have aroused any scandal among the churchmen of her country, while Sean Miller in his \"Dictionary of National Biography\" article on \u00c6thelbald says that very little is known of his reign after his marriage, but he appears to have been on good terms with \u00c6thelberht.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It recognizes distinguished fiction by an American author, preferably dealing with American life, published during the preceding calendar year. \nAs the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel (awarded 1918\u20131947), it was one of the original Pulitzers; the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year (no Novel prize was awarded in 1917, the first one having been granted in 1918).\nThe name was changed to the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1948, and eligibility was expanded to also include short stories, novellas, novelettes, and poetry, as well as novels.\nFinalists have been announced since 1980, usually a total of three.\nDefinition.\nAs defined in the original Plan of Award, the prize was given \"Annually, for the American novel published during the year which shall best present the wholesome atmosphere of American life, and the highest standard of American manners and manhood,\" although there was some struggle over whether the word \"wholesome\" should be used instead of \"whole\", the word Pulitzer had written in his will. In 1927, the advisory board quietly instituted Pulitzer's word choice, replacing \"wholesome\" with \"whole\".\nA new consideration arose when the Pulitzer jury was unanimous in recommending Thornton Wilder's \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\" for the 1928 prize, although the book deals with Peruvians in Peru, not with Americans in America. The jury chair, Richard Burton of Columbia University, emphasized the \"moral\" value of the book in his report to the advisory board: \"This piece of fiction is not only an admirable example of literary skill in the art of fiction, but also possesses a philosophic import and a spiritual elevation which greatly increases its literary value.\" Robert Morss Lovett disagreed, saying it would be \"mere subterfuge to say that it has anything to do with the highest standard of American manners and manhood,\" but went along with the jury in finding \"less literary merit\" in the other novels under discussion. (Lovett rejected the runner-up \"Black April\" by Julia Peterkin, calling it \"a rather unedifying picture of life in a primitive negro community\" and \"an ironical answer to the terms on which the prize is offered.\" Peterkin won nevertheless in 1929 for a similar novel, \"Scarlet Sister Mary\".) Having settled on \"Bridge\", the Advisory Board redefined the conditions from \"whole atmosphere of American life, and the highest standard of American manners and manhood\" to \"preferably one which shall best present the whole atmosphere of American life,\" although this did not address the novel's setting. Further refinement into \"the best novel published that year by an American author\" removed any impediment to Pearl S. Buck's \"The Good Earth\" in 1932, also with a foreign setting in its study of Chinese village life in Anhui, East China.\nWith 1929 came the first of several much more substantive changes. The board changed the wording to \"preferably one which shall best present the whole atmosphere of American life\" and deleted the insistence that the novel portray \"the highest standard of American manners and manhood\". In 1936, emphasis was changed again, with the award going to \"a distinguished novel published during the year by an American author, preferably dealing with American life\". In 1948, the advisory board widened the scope of the award with the wording \"For distinguished fiction published in book form during the year by an American author, preferably dealing with American life.\" This change allowed the prize to go to a collection of short stories for the first time, James Michener's \"Tales of the South Pacific\".\nWinners.\nIn 31 years under the \"Novel\" name, the prize was awarded 27 times; in its first 76 years to 2024 under the \"Fiction\" name, 70 times. There have been 11 years during which no title received the award. It was shared by two authors for the first time in 2023. Since this category's inception in 1918, 31 women have won the prize.

He was the third son of King \u00c6thelwulf by his first wife, Osburh. \u00c6thelberht was first recorded as a witness to a charter in 854. The following year \u00c6thelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome and appointed his oldest surviving son, \u00c6thelbald, as king of Wessex while \u00c6thelberht became king of the recently conquered territory of Kent. \u00c6thelberht may have surrendered his position to his father when he returned from pilgrimage but resumed (or kept) the south-eastern kingship when his father died in 858.\nWhen \u00c6thelbald died in 860, \u00c6thelberht united both their territories under his rule. He did not appoint a sub-king and Wessex and Kent were fully united for the first time. He appears to have been on good terms with his younger brothers, the future kings \u00c6thelred I and Alfred the Great. The kingdom came under attack from Viking raids during his reign, but these were minor compared with the invasions after his death. \u00c6thelberht died in the autumn of 865 and was buried next to his brother \u00c6thelbald at Sherborne Abbey in Dorset. He was succeeded by \u00c6thelred.\nBackground.\nWhen \u00c6thelberht's grandfather Ecgberht became king of Wessex in 802, it must have seemed very unlikely to contemporaries that he would establish a lasting dynasty. For two hundred years, three families had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. Ecgberht's nearest connection to a previous king of Wessex was as a great-great-grandson of Ingild, brother of King Ine (688\u2013726), but he was believed to be a paternal descendant of Cerdic, the founder of the West Saxon dynasty. This made Ecgberht an \u00e6theling \u2013 a prince who had a legitimate claim to the throne. But in the ninth and tenth centuries, descent from Cerdic was no longer sufficient to make a man an \u00e6theling: Ecgberht's line controlled the kingdom and all kings were sons of kings.\nAt the beginning of the ninth century, England was almost wholly under the control of the Anglo-Saxons. The Midland kingdom of Mercia dominated southern England, but their supremacy came to an end in 825 when they were decisively defeated by Ecgberht at the Battle of Ellendun. The two kingdoms became allies, which was important in the resistance to Viking attacks. In the same year Ecgberht sent his son \u00c6thelwulf to conquer the Mercian sub-kingdom of Kent (the area of the modern county plus Essex, Surrey and Sussex) and appointed him sub-king. In 835 the Isle of Sheppey was ravaged by Vikings and in the following year they defeated Ecgberht at Carhampton in Somerset, but in 838 he was victorious over an alliance of Cornishmen and Vikings at the Battle of Hingston Down, reducing Cornwall to the status of a client kingdom. He died in 839 and was succeeded by \u00c6thelwulf, who appointed his eldest son \u00c6thelstan as sub-king of Kent. \u00c6thelwulf and Ecgberht may not have intended a permanent union between Wessex and Kent as they both appointed sons as sub-kings and charters in Wessex were attested (witnessed) by West Saxon magnates, while Kentish charters were witnessed by the Kentish elite; both kings kept overall control and the sub-kings were not allowed to issue their own coinage.\nViking raids increased in the early 840s on both sides of the English Channel, and in 843 \u00c6thelwulf was defeated by the companies of 35 Danish ships at Carhampton. In 850 \u00c6thelstan defeated a Danish fleet off Sandwich in the first recorded naval battle in English history. In 851 \u00c6thelwulf and his second son \u00c6thelbald defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Aclea and, according to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", \"there made the greatest slaughter of a heathen raiding-army that we have heard tell of up to this present day, and there took the victory\".\nSources.\nAnglo-Saxon charters provide the major source for \u00c6thelberht's life and narrative accounts are very limited. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" only mentions two events in his reign and these are also the only incidents related in Asser's biography of his younger brother Alfred the Great, which is mainly based on the \"Chronicle\" for the mid-tenth century.\nFamily.\n\u00c6thelberht was the third of five sons of \u00c6thelwulf and his first wife Osburh, who died around 855. \u00c6thelstan died in the early 850s, but the four younger brothers were successively kings of Wessex: \u00c6thelbald from 855 to 860, \u00c6thelberht from 860 to 865, \u00c6thelred I from 865 to 871 and Alfred the Great from 871 to 899. \u00c6thelberht had one sister, \u00c6thelswith, who married King Burgred of Mercia in 853.\nEarly life.\n\u00c6thelberht was first recorded when he attested charters in 854. In the following year \u00c6thelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome after appointing his eldest surviving son, \u00c6thelbald, under-king of Wessex and \u00c6thelberht under-king of Kent, Essex, Sussex and Surrey, appointments which suggest that his sons were to succeed to the separate kingdoms whether or not he returned to England. \u00c6thelberht attested charters as \"dux\" (ealdorman) in 854 and king in 855. In 856, \u00c6thelwulf returned to England with a new wife, Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, king of the West Franks. \u00c6thelbald, with the support of Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, Ealdorman of Somerset, refused to give up his kingship of Wessex. \u00c6thelwulf compromised to avoid a civil war, but historians disagree on how the kingdom was divided. According to Asser, \u00c6thelwulf was assigned the \"eastern districts\", and most historians assume that \u00c6thelbald kept Wessex while \u00c6thelberht gave up Kent to his father; some others believe that Wessex itself was divided, with \u00c6thelbald ruling the west and \u00c6thelwulf the east, and \u00c6thelberht retaining Kent.\n\u00c6thelwulf confirmed that he intended a permanent division of his kingdom as he recommended that on his death \u00c6thelbald should be king of Wessex and \u00c6thelberht king of Kent. This proposal was carried out when \u00c6thelwulf died in 858. According to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\": \"And then \u00c6thelwulf's two sons succeeded to the kingdom: \u00c6thelbald to the kingdom of Wessex, and \u00c6thelberht to the kingdom of the inhabitants of Kent and to the kingdom of Essex and to Surrey and to the kingdom of Sussex\". \u00c6thelbald was later condemned by Alfred the Great's biographer, Asser, both for his rebellion against his father and because he married his father's widow, but he appears to have been on good terms with \u00c6thelberht. In 858 \u00c6thelbald issued a charter (S 1274) relating to land in Surrey, and thus in his brother's territory, and a charter he issued in 860 (S 326) was witnessed by \u00c6thelberht and Judith.\n\u00c6thelberht appears to have made significant changes in personnel as a Kentish charter of 858 (S 328) was witnessed by twenty-one thegns, out of whom fourteen did not witness a surviving charter of his father. They include Eastmund, who \u00c6thelberht later appointed ealdorman of Kent. The charter is regarded by historians as important because it clarifies the obligations of folkland.\nReign.\nThe separation of Wessex and Kent was soon reversed as \u00c6thelbald died childless in 860 and \u00c6thelberht succeeded to the whole kingdom of Wessex and Kent. \u00c6thelred and Alfred may have been intended to succeed in Wessex, but they were too young as the preference was for adults as kings, especially when Wessex was under threat from the Vikings. During \u00c6thelberht's rule over the whole kingdom, Wessex and its recent south-eastern conquests became a united kingdom for the first time. Unlike his father and grandfather, \u00c6thelberht did not appoint another member of his family as under-king of Kent. A Kentish charter issued in the first year of his reign (S 327) was the first to include a full complement both of West Saxon and Kentish attesters, although he then returned to locally attested charters.\nThe historian Simon Keynes sees this charter as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a highly significant development. It is exceptional in naming not only the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Rochester (which is all that we might have been led to expect in a Kentish charter), but also the bishops of Sherborne, Winchester, Selsey and (most remarkably) London; it is also exceptional in carrying the attestations of no fewer than ten ealdormen, from both the western and eastern parts of the kingdom. When placed in the context of other ninth-century West Saxon charters, this charter seems to reflect an assembly of a kind not previously seen and a kind of assembly which itself reflected the new arrangements for the unification of Wessex and the south-east.\nAccording to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", \u00c6thelberht reigned \"in good harmony and in great peace\" and \"in peace, love and honour\". He appears to have been on good terms with his younger brothers and in a charter of 861 (S 330) he granted land to St Augustine's, Canterbury, in return for the abbot's continuing loyalty to him, \u00c6thelred, and Alfred. Some historians believe that the three brothers agreed that each would succeed to the throne in turn. In two charters in 862 and 863 (S 335 and S 336) \u00c6thelred makes grants as king of the West Saxons and \u00c6thelberht is not mentioned. In Keynes's view, \u00c6thelberht may have delegated some power in Wessex, perhaps in his own absence. However, a charter of \u00c6thelberht dated December 863 (S 333) is attested by \u00c6thelred and Alfred as \"filius regis\" (king's son). \u00c6thelberht granted immunity from royal and judicial services to Sherborne church in honour of the souls of his father \u00c6thelwulf and his brother \u00c6thelbald. Unlike most charters, which were in Latin, this one is in Old English, and historians disagree whether this reflects a trend towards greater use of the vernacular as better suited to recording legal documents or support for Alfred's later claim that knowledge of Latin had declined disastrously when he came to the throne in 871.\n\u00c6thelberht's reign began and ended with raids by the Vikings. In 860, a Viking army sailed from the Somme to England and sacked Winchester, but they were then defeated by the men of Hampshire and Berkshire. Probably in the autumn of 864, another Viking army camped on Thanet and were promised money in return for peace, but they broke their promise and ravaged eastern Kent. These attacks were minor compared with events after \u00c6thelberht's death, when the Vikings almost conquered England.\nCoinage.\nIn the late eighth and ninth centuries, the only denomination of coin produced in southern England was the silver penny. Coins were minted in an unidentified town in Wessex itself, but activity in the mid-ninth century was minimal and no Wessex coins of \u00c6thelberht are known. Kent had mints at Canterbury and Rochester and they produced coins in the name of \u00c6thelwulf until 858 and \u00c6thelberht thereafter. The lack of coins in the name of \u00c6thelbald is evidence that he did not have any status of overlordship over \u00c6thelberht. In the early ninth century the quality of the inscription and the bust of the king on coins declined, but it revived on the Inscribed Cross penny at the end of \u00c6thelwulf's reign and this continued under \u00c6thelberht's, which also saw the introduction of the rare Floreate Cross design in about 862. There was a considerable increase in the number of moneyers: twelve struck Inscribed Cross coins in \u00c6thelwulf's reign and fifty in \u00c6thelberht's. This may have been due to a recoinage starting at the end of \u00c6thelwulf's reign and continuing in \u00c6thelberht's, when old coins were called in and melted down to make new ones. The silver content of his Inscribed Cross issue fell to below 50% and one penny minted in Canterbury has only 30%, but a Floreate Cross coin has 84%, perhaps indicating that it was intended as a recoinage with higher fineness. There was also increasing standardisation of design in the coinage, reflecting greater royal control over currency and minting in the middle of the ninth century.\nDeath and reputation.\n\u00c6thelberht died of unknown causes in the autumn of 865. He was buried at Sherborne Abbey in Dorset beside his brother \u00c6thelbald but the tombs had been lost by the sixteenth century. He had no known children and was succeeded by his brother \u00c6thelred.\nAccording to Asser, who based his account of events before 887 mainly on the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\": \"So after governing in peace, love and honour for five years, \u00c6thelberht went the way of all flesh, to the great sorrow of his people; and he lies buried honourably beside his brother, at Sherborne.\" Asser's view was followed by post-Conquest historians. John of Worcester copied Asser's words, while William of Malmesbury described him as \"a vigorous but kindly ruler\". The 20th-century historian Alfred Smyth points out that the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", which was first written in Alfred the Great's reign, only recorded two events in \u00c6thelberht's reign, the attacks on Winchester and eastern Kent, and does not associate the king personally with either of them. Smyth argues that this reflected an agenda by Alfred's propagandists to play down the achievements of his brothers to enhance the reputation of Alfred himself.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "48588", "revid": "50609393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48588", "title": "Martyr", "text": "Person who suffers persecution\nA martyr (, \"m\u00e1rtys\", 'witness' stem , \"martyr-\") is someone who suffers persecution and death for advocating, renouncing, or refusing to renounce or advocate, a religious belief or other cause as demanded by an external party. In colloquial usage, the term can also refer to any person who suffers a significant consequence in protest or support of a cause.\nIn the martyrdom narrative of the remembering community, this refusal to comply with the presented demands results in the punishment or execution of an individual by an oppressor. Accordingly, the status of the 'martyr' can be considered a posthumous title as a reward for those who are considered worthy of the concept of martyrdom by the living, regardless of any attempts by the deceased to control how they will be remembered in advance. Insofar, the martyr is a relational figure of a society's boundary work that is produced by collective memory. Originally applied only to those who suffered for their religious beliefs, the term has come to be used in connection with people killed for a political cause.\nMost martyrs are considered holy or are respected by their followers, becoming symbols of exceptional leadership and heroism in the face of difficult circumstances. Martyrs play significant roles in religions. Similarly, martyrs have had notable effects in secular life, including such figures as Socrates, among other political and cultural examples.\nMeaning.\nIn its original meaning, the word martyr, meaning \"witness\", was used in the secular sphere as well as in the New Testament of the Bible. The process of bearing witness was not intended to lead to the death of the witness, although it is known from ancient writers (e.g., Josephus) and from the New Testament that witnesses often died for their testimonies.\nDuring the early Christian centuries, the term acquired the extended meaning of believers who are called to witness for their religious belief, and on account of this witness, endure suffering or death. The term, in this later sense, entered the English language as a loanword. The death of a martyr or the value attributed to it is called \"martyrdom\".\nThe early Christians who first began to use the term \"martyr\" in its new sense saw Jesus as the first and greatest martyr, on account of his crucifixion. The early Christians appear to have seen Jesus as the archetypal martyr.\nThe word \"martyr\" is used in English to describe a wide variety of people. However, the following table presents a general outline of common features present in stereotypical martyrdoms.\nA female martyr may rarely be referred to as a martyress.\nMartyrdom in the Middle East.\nIn contemporary Middle Eastern cultures, the term for 'martyr' (Arabic \"shahid\") has more uses than the English word 'martyr'.\nWhile the term can be narrowly used for a person who is killed because of their religion, it is more generally used to mean a person who died a violent death. Thus it can arguably mean a general 'victim'.\nA person is a martyr if they were killed because of their identity, because of natural disasters like earthquakes, or while performing relief or health care work. For example, \u0130brahim Bilgen was killed by Israel in the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid. Because he died as a humantiarian activist, he is called a martyr by Al-Jazeera.\nMartyrdom is also tied with nationalism, because a martyr can be a person who died in the context of national struggle. For example, in Beirut, Martyrs' Square is a public square that's dedicated to Lebanese nationalists who were executed by the Ottomans.\nIn Palestine, the word 'martyr' is traditionally used to mean a person killed by Israeli forces, regardless of religion. For example, Shireen Abu Akleh was a Palestinian Christian journalist who was killed by Israeli forces, and Arabic media calls her a 'martyr'. This reflects a communal belief that every Palestinian death is part of a resistance against Israeli occupation. Children are likewise called martyrs, such as the children of journalist Wael Al-Dahdouh who were killed in an Israeli airstrike.\nThe label of martyrdom is used as a form of memoralizing the dead within some narrative, such as how the victims of the 2020 Beirut explosion were called 'martyrs of corruption' as a form of protest against the government.\nThe wide usage of 'martyr' is not restricted to Arabic. Armenian culture likewise uses the term for the victims of the Armenian genocide, who are called \"Holy Martyrs\". April 24 is Armenian Genocide Memorial Day, and also called \"Armenian Martyrs Day\".\nReligious meanings.\nEastern religions.\nChinese culture.\nMartyrdom was extensively promoted by the Tongmenghui and the Kuomintang party in modern China. Revolutionaries who died fighting against the Qing dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution and throughout the Republic of China period, furthering the cause of the revolution, were recognized as martyrs.\nHinduism.\nAccording to Stephen Knapp, despite the promotion of \"ahimsa\" (non-violence) within Sanatana Dharma, and there being no concept of martyrdom, there is the belief of righteous duty (\"dharma\"), where violence is used as a last resort to resolution after all other means have failed. Examples of this are found in the Mahabharata. Upon completion of their exile, the Pandavas were refused the return of their portion of the kingdom by their cousin Duryodhana; and following which all means of peace talks by Krishna, Vidura and Sanjaya failed. During the great war which commenced, even Arjuna was brought down with doubts, e.g., attachment, sorrow, fear. This is where Krishna instructs Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita how to carry out his duty as a righteous warrior and fight.\nSikhism.\nMartyrdom (called \"shahadat\" in Punjabi) is a fundamental concept in Sikhism and represents an important institution of the faith. Sikhs believe in \"Ibaadat se Shahadat\" (from love to martyrdom). Some famous Sikh martyrs include:\nAbrahamic religions.\nJudaism.\nMartyrdom in Judaism is one of the main examples of \"Kiddush Hashem\", meaning \"sanctification of God's name\" through public dedication to Jewish practice. Religious martyrdom is considered one of the more significant contributions of Hellenistic Judaism to Western Civilization. 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees recount numerous martyrdoms suffered by Jews resisting Hellenizing (adoption of Greek ideas or customs of a Hellenistic civilization) by their Seleucid overlords, being executed for such crimes as observing the Sabbath, circumcising their boys or refusing to eat pork or meat sacrificed to foreign gods. However, the notion of martyrdom in the Jewish and Christian traditions differ considerably.\nThere are times that the Hebrew Bible records that the Israelites, the ancestors of the Jews, are instructed to wage war against their enemies in the Bible sometimes as instructed by God or their leaders or both. Examples are wars against Amalek and the Seven Nations. Such wars are known as \"Milkhemet Mitzvah\" (\"war by commandment\" in Hebrew, or \"Holy War\") and any Israelite or Jew who is killed in the course of fighting for the cause is automatically regarded as having died \"al Kiddush Hashem\" (\"for Sanctifying God's Name\") and is hence a Jewish martyr.\nChristianity.\nIn Christianity, a martyr, in accordance with the meaning of the original Greek term \"martys\" in the New Testament, is one who brings a testimony, usually written or verbal. In particular, the testimony is that of the Christian Gospel, or more generally, the Word of God. A Christian witness is a biblical witness whether or not death follows.\nThe concept of Jesus as a martyr has recently received greater attention. Analyses of the Passion narratives in the Gospels have led many scholars to conclude that they are martyrdom accounts in terms of genre and style. Several scholars have also concluded that Paul the Apostle understood Jesus' death as a martyrdom. In light of such conclusions, some have argued that the early Christians of the first three centuries would have interpreted the crucifixion of Jesus as a martyrdom.\nIn the context of church history, from the time of the persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire under the Julio-Claudian dynasty, it developed that a martyr was one who was killed for maintaining a religious belief, \"knowing\" that this will almost certainly result in imminent death (though without intentionally seeking death). This definition of \"martyr\" is not specifically restricted to the Christian faith. Christianity recognizes certain Old Testament Jewish figures, like Abel and the Maccabees, as holy, and the New Testament mentions the imprisonment and beheading of John the Baptist, Jesus's possible cousin and his prophet and forerunner. The first Christian witness, after the establishment of the Christian faith at Pentecost, to be killed for his testimony was Saint Stephen (whose name means \"crown\"), and those who suffer martyrdom are said to have been \"crowned\". From the time of the Roman Emperor Constantine, Christianity was decriminalized, and then, under Theodosius I, became the state religion, which greatly diminished persecution (although not for non-Nicene Christians). As some wondered how then they could most closely follow Christ there was a development of \"desert spirituality\" characterized by a eremitic lifestyle, renunciation, self-mortification, and separation from the world, practiced by several desert monks and Christian ascetics in late antiquity (such as Paul the Hermit and Anthony the Great). This was a kind of \"white martyrdom\", dying to oneself every day, as opposed to a \"red martyrdom\", the giving of one's life in a violent death.\nIn the history of Christianity, death due to sectarian persecutions by other Christians has been regarded as martyrdom as well. There were martyrs recognized on both sides of the schism between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England after 1534. Two hundred and eighty-eight Christians were martyred for their faith by public burning between 1553 and 1558 by the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I in England leading to the reversion to the Church of England under Queen Elizabeth I in 1559. \"From hundreds to thousands\" of Waldensians were martyred in the Massacre of M\u00e9rindol in 1545. Three-hundred Roman Catholics were said to have been martyred by the Church authorities in England in the 16th and 17th centuries.\nEven more modern day accounts of martyrdom for Christ exist, depicted in books such as \"Jesus Freaks\", though the numbers are disputed. The claim that 100,000 Christians are killed for their faith annually is greatly exaggerated according to the BBC, with many of those deaths due to war, but the fact of ongoing Christian martyrdoms remains undisputed.\nIslam.\n\"Shahid\" is an Arabic term in Islam meaning \"witness\", and is also used to denote a martyr; a female martyr is named \"shahida\". The term \"Shahid\" occurs frequently in the Quran in the generic sense \"witness\", but only once in the sense \"martyr, one who dies for his faith\"; this latter sense acquires wider use in the \"\u1e25ad\u012bth\" literature. Islam views a martyr as a man or woman who dies while conducting \"jihad\", whether on or off the battlefield (see greater jihad and lesser jihad).\nThe concept of martyrdom in Islam became prominent during the Islamic Revolution in Iran (1979) and the subsequent Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u20131988), so that the cult of the martyr had a lasting impact on the course of revolution and war. Since the early 2000s, it has been primarily associated with Islamic extremism and jihadism.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nIn the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, martyrs are those who sacrifice their lives serving humanity in the name of God. However, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, discouraged the literal meaning of sacrificing one's life. Instead, he explained that martyrdom is devoting oneself to service to humanity.\nPolitical meanings.\nIn politics, a martyr is someone who suffers persecution and/or death for advocating, renouncing, refusing to renounce, and/or refusing to advocate a political belief or cause.\nSovereignty.\nThe leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising were executed for organising an armed insurrection in Ireland during Easter Week in April 1916. A series of courts martial began on 2 May, in which 187 people were tried. Controversially, Maxwell decided that the courts martial would be held in secret and without a defence, which Crown law officers later ruled to have been illegal. Ninety were sentenced to death. Fifteen of those (including all seven signatories of the Proclamation of Independence ) had their sentences confirmed by Maxwell and fourteen were executed by firing squad at Kilmainham Gaol between 3 and 12 May.https://.\nThe Manchester Martyrs were three Irishmen executed after being convicted for the murder of a Manchester City Police officer in 1867. The day after the executions, Frederick Engels wrote to Karl Marx: \"Yesterday morning the Tories, by the hand of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. ... To my knowledge, the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent.\" Ten Irish Republican Army members died during a 1981 hunger strike, including Bobby Sands.\nThe Belfiore martyrs (in Italian, \"Martiri di Belfiore\") were a group of Italian pro-independence fighters condemned to death by hanging in 1853 during the Italian Risorgimento. They included Tito Speri and the priest Enrico Tazzoli and are named after the site where the sentence was carried out, in the valley of Belfiore at the south entrance to Mantua.\nUnionism.\nThe Tolpuddle Martyrs were a group of 19th century agricultural labourers in Dorset, England, who were arrested for and convicted of swearing a secret oath as members of the \"Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers.\" The rules of the society showed it was clearly structured as a friendly society, that is, a mutual association for the purposes of insurance, pensions, savings or cooperative banking; and it operated as a trade-specific benefit society. But at the time, friendly societies had strong elements of what are now considered to be the principal role of trade unions, and wages were at issue. The Tolpuddle Martyrs were sentenced not to death but to transportation to Australia, a harsh form of exile.\nCommunism.\nIn the People's Republic of China, people who died in the cause of the Communist Party\u2014most particularly the many victims of the 1927 Shanghai massacre but also including devoted humanitarians during the Chinese Civil War such as the Canadian physician Tillson Harrison\u2014are honored and commemorated as martyrs. The red scarf worn by the 100+ million Young Pioneers honors their spilt blood. Jiang Zhuyun and Liu Hulan are notable female martyrs who have been commemorated in various media. Notable monuments include the Monument to the People's Heroes at the confluence of Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu River in central Shanghai and the Longhua Martyrs' Memorial.\nMany communist activists have died as martyrs in India, due to their allegiance to various communist parties, such as the CPI(M) and the CPI. Most of them hail from mainly leftist states such as Kerala, and Tripura. In Kerala, many are killed in protests by the police, and some are assassinated by activists in other political parties, such as the INC and the RSS. The district of Kannur has reported to have had the most political murders. Here, the RSS are known to have used brutal violence to eliminate CPI(M) workers.\nCivil rights movement.\nIn the United States, the assassinations of Malcolm X in 1965 and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 have been linked to their leadership in movements to improve the rights and quality of life of black citizens, black nationalism and the civil rights movement respectively.\nNotable people entitled as political martyrs.\nA political martyr is someone who suffers persecution or death for advocating, renouncing, refusing to renounce, or refusing to advocate a political belief or cause.\nRevolutionary martyr.\nThe term \"revolutionary martyr\" usually relates to those dying in revolutionary struggle. During the 20th century, the concept was developed in particular in the culture and propaganda of communist or socialist revolutions, although it was and is also used in relation to nationalist revolutions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the 1950s, she published a series of social comedies, of which the best known are \"Excellent Women\" (1952) and \"A Glass of Blessings\" (1958). After a period of rejection by publishers, her career was revived in 1977 when the critic Lord David Cecil and the poet Philip Larkin nominated her as the most underrated writer of the previous 75 years. Her novel \"Quartet in Autumn\" (1977) was nominated for the Booker Prize that year, and she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBarbara Mary Crampton Pym was born on 2 June 1913 at 72 Willow Street in Oswestry, Shropshire, the elder daughter of Irena Spenser, \"n\u00e9e\" Thomas (1886\u20131945) and Frederic Crampton Pym (1879\u20131966), a solicitor. She was educated at Queen's Park School, a girls' school in Oswestry. From the age of 12, she attended Huyton College, near Liverpool. Pym's parents were active in the local Oswestry operatic society, and she was encouraged to write and be creative from an early age. She spent most of her childhood at Morda Lodge in Morda Road, Oswestry, where in 1922 she staged her first play, \"The Magic Diamond\", performed by family and friends.\nIn 1931 she went to St Hilda's College, Oxford, to study English. There she developed a close friendship with the future novelist and literary critic Robert Liddell, who would read her early works and provide key feedback. She took a second-class BA honours degree in English Language and Literature in 1934. In the 1930s she visited Germany several times, developing a love for the country, and a romantic relationship with a young Nazi officer, Friedbert Gluck. She initially admired Hitler, and did not foresee the advent of war, but she later recognised her \"blind spot\", and removed a character based on Gluck from the novel she was writing.\nIn early 1939, Pym approached Jonathan Cape about a job in publishing; none was available at the time. The outbreak of World War II changed her plans, and in 1941 she went to work for the Censorship Department in Bristol, initially checking letters between Irish families in Britain and Ireland. Later, she joined the Women's Royal Naval Service. From 1943 she served in naval postal censorship in Southampton, and was subsequently posted to Naples. She had learned about coded messages while an examiner, and may have worked for or with MI5.\nPersonal life.\nIn June 1946, Pym started work at the International African Institute in London. She became the assistant editor of the scholarly journal \"Africa\", and continued in this role until her retirement in 1974. That inspired her use of anthropologists as characters in some of her novels, notably \"Excellent Women\", \"Less than Angels\" and \"An Unsuitable Attachment\". Pym's sister Hilary separated from her husband in 1946, and the two sisters moved into a flat in Pimlico. Later they moved to a house in Queen's Park.\nPym did not marry or have children, but had several close relationships with men. In her undergraduate days, they included Henry Harvey (a fellow Oxford student, who remained the love of her life) and Rupert Gleadow. When she was 24 she had a romance with the future politician Julian Amery, six years her junior. In 1942 she had a brief relationship with the BBC radio producer Gordon Glover, who was the estranged husband of her friend Honor Wyatt. Glover broke this off abruptly, which deeply upset Pym, and when Glover died in 1975 she burnt her diary for 1942.\nEarly literary career.\nPym wrote her first novel, \"Some Tame Gazelle\", in 1935, but it was rejected by numerous publishers, including Jonathan Cape and Gollancz. She wrote another novel, \"Civil to Strangers\", in 1936, and several novellas in the following years, which were published as \"Civil to Strangers\" after Pym's death. In 1940, Pym wrote the novel \"Crampton Hodnet\", which was also published after her death.\nAfter some years of submitting stories to women's magazines, Pym heavily revised \"Some Tame Gazelle\", which this time was accepted by Jonathan Cape, and published in 1950. The poet Philip Larkin described \"Some Tame Gazelle\" as Pym's \"Pride and Prejudice\". The novel follows the lives of two middle-aged spinster sisters in an English village before the War, who in the course of the narrative are both given offers of marriage but turn them down in favour of their settled life. That year, Pym also had a radio play \u2013 \"Something to Remember\" \u2013 accepted by the BBC.\nPym's second novel, \"Excellent Women\" (1952), was well received, but her third, \"Jane and Prudence\" (1953), received more mixed reviews. Her fourth novel, \"Less than Angels\" (1955), had poorer sales than the previous three, but it attracted enough attention to be Pym's debut novel in the United States. A representative from Twentieth Century Fox came to England with an interest in securing the film rights, but this fell through.\nPym's fifth novel, \"A Glass of Blessings\" (1958), was poorly reviewed. Pym noted that \u2013 of her first six novels \u2013 it was the worst reviewed. However, the inclusion of sympathetic homosexual characters, in an era when homosexuality was largely frowned upon, and homosexual acts between men were illegal, attracted some interest in contemporary reviews, including \"The Daily Telegraph\". Pym's sixth novel was \"No Fond Return of Love\" (1961), in which two women engaged in editorial work fall in love with the same man. The book continued the trend of Pym's novels receiving minimal critical attention. Nonetheless, it was positively reviewed in \"Tatler\", the reviewer commenting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I love and admire Miss Pym's pussycat wit and profoundly unsoppy kindliness, and we may leave the deeply peculiar, face-saving, gently tormented English middle classes safely in her hands.When Pym made a less than flattering allusion to a Marks and Spencer's dress in her work, the company's legal department was sufficiently concerned by her influence to write to her.\n\"Wilderness years\".\nIn 1963, Pym submitted her seventh novel \u2013 \"An Unsuitable Attachment\" \u2013 to Cape. Editor Tom Maschler, who had recently joined the firm, rejected the manuscript, on the advice of two readers. Pym wrote back to protest that she was being unfairly treated, but was told (sympathetically but firmly) that the novel did not show promise. Pym revised the manuscript and sent it to several other publishers, but with no success. Pym was advised that her style of writing was old-fashioned, and that the public were no longer interested in books about small-town spinsters and vicars. She was forced to consider finding a new authorial voice, but concluded that she was too old to adapt to what publishers considered popular taste. Pym was told that the minimum 'economic figure' for book sales was 4,000 copies; several of her books from the 1950s had not achieved that number.\nAs a result, Pym did not publish anything from 1962 until 1977. Nevertheless, she continued to write novels and short stories, and to refine existing works, while she continued her career at the International African Institute. Pym never fully forgave Cape, or Tom Maschler. She and her sister invented a dessert called \"Maschler pudding\", which was a combination of lime jelly and milk. In 1965, she wrote in a letter, \"I really still wonder if my books will \"ever\" be acceptable again\". Pym wrote \"The Sweet Dove Died\" in 1968 and \"An Academic Question\" in 1970. She submitted \"Dove\" to several publishers but it too was rejected. However, her earlier novels were reprinted during this period because of popular demand in public libraries.\nPym wrote 27 short stories, of which only six were published during her lifetime. The remainder are stored in the Pym archives at the Bodleian Library.\nIn 1961, Pym began a correspondence with Philip Larkin, as he wanted to write a review article of her novels. They continued to exchange letters for 19 years, up to her death. They met for the first time in April 1975, at the Randolph Hotel, Oxford.\nIn 1971, Pym was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy of her left breast. The operation was successful and she was deemed clear of cancer. In 1972, Pym and her sister Hilary purchased Barn Cottage in Finstock in Oxfordshire. The sisters played an active role in the social life of the village. Pym retired in 1974. That year, she had a minor stroke, which left her temporarily with something like dyslexia. She continued to write, and completed \"Quartet in Autumn\" in 1976; it was rejected by Hamish Hamilton Limited. Although Pym was no longer being published, she was appointed to the awards committee of the Romantic Novelists' Association.\nRediscovery and final years.\nOn 21 January 1977, the \"Times Literary Supplement\" ran an article in which high-profile writers and academics named their most underrated and overrated books or authors of the previous 75 years (the lifetime of the publication). Pym was chosen as the most underrated writer by both Larkin and Lord David Cecil, and was the only person to be selected by two contributors. On the strength of that article, literary interest in Pym was revived after 16 years. Pym and Larkin had kept up a correspondence for 17 years, but even his influence had been of no use in getting her a new publishing contract. Several publishing companies now expressed an interest, including her former publisher Cape. Pym rejected them in favour of Macmillan, who agreed to publish \"Quartet in Autumn\" the same year. Before \"Quartet\" had been published, Macmillan also agreed to publish \"The Sweet Dove Died\", which she had reworked since completing it 10 years earlier. Cape reprinted her earlier novels, to which they still had the rights. The BBC interviewed Pym for a programme, \"Tea with Miss Pym\", which aired on 21 October 1977. Reviews of \"Quartet\" were almost uniformly positive, and the novel was nominated for the 1977 Booker Prize, which went to Paul Scott for \"Staying On\".\nThe rediscovery also meant that Pym attracted more notice in the United States (\"Less Than Angels\" had been published there earlier). E. P. Dutton secured the rights to all of her existing novels and, starting with \"Excellent Women\" and \"Quartet in Autumn\", published her entire \"oeuvre\" between 1978 and 1987. The discovery of Pym's novels, combined with the narrative of her \"comeback\", made her a minor success in the USA during that period. Following her return to the public eye, she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Pym was the subject of \"Desert Island Discs\" on 1 August 1978; the episode was replayed on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 2 June 2013 \u2013 the centenary of her birth.\nPym's later novels have a more sombre, reflective tone than her earlier ones, which were in the high comedy tradition. By mid-1977, she had conceived an idea for her next novel, \"A Few Green Leaves\", which would turn out to be her last. In January 1979, a lump in Pym's abdomen was diagnosed as malignant, a return of the breast cancer she had had in 1971. She underwent chemotherapy while completing the draft of \"A Few Green Leaves\". Aware that she did not have long to live, she attempted to complete the novel before her death. She had already conceived the plot of another novel, which would follow two women from different social backgrounds, starting with their youth and moving through to maturity, including sequences set in World War II, but she would never have the opportunity to work on it. By October 1979, Pym was confined to bed. Although not entirely satisfied with the final draft of \"A Few Green Leaves\", she submitted it to Macmillan, and it was published in 1980, shortly after her death.\nOn 11 January 1980, Barbara Pym died of cancer, aged 66. Following her death, her sister Hilary continued to champion her work, and was involved in setting up the Barbara Pym Society in 1993. Posthumously, \"Crampton Hodnet\", \"An Academic Question\" and \"An Unsuitable Attachment\" were published, in conjunction with Pym's literary executor, the novelist Hazel Holt. Holt and Hilary Pym also published \"Civil to Strangers and Other Writings\", a collection of writings mostly from Pym's early years. Holt and Hilary Pym published three more volumes: \"A Very Private Eye\", an \"autobiography\" based on Pym's diaries and letters, \"\", a biography written by Holt, and \"A la Pym\", a cookbook comprising recipes for dishes featured in Pym's novels.\nHilary lived at Barn Cottage until her death in February 2004. The Pym sisters are buried in Finstock churchyard. In 2006, a blue plaque was placed on the cottage.\nLegacy.\nThe Barbara Pym Society, established by fans of the author, was formed on 15 April 1994, following a literary weekend exploring the work of Barbara Pym held at St. Hilda\u2019s College in 1993. The Society holds its Annual General Meeting at St. Hilda\u2019s every September. The Barbara Pym Society also holds a spring meeting in London, and an annual North American conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nAn English Heritage blue plaque honouring Pym was installed at 108 Cambridge Street, Pimlico, London on 1 May 2025, marking where she lived between 1945 and 1949.\nWorks and themes.\nSeveral themes link works in the Pym canon, which are more notable for their style and characterisation than for their plots. A superficial reading gives the impression that they are sketches of village or London life, and comedies of manners, studying the social activities connected with the Anglican church, Anglo-Catholic parishes in particular. Pym attended several churches over her lifetime, including St Michael and All Angels Church, Barnes, where she served on the Parochial Church Council.\nPym examines aspects of relations between women and men, including the unrequited feelings of women for men, which are based on her own experience. Pym was one of the first popular novelists to write sympathetically about gay characters, notably in \"A Glass of Blessings\". She portrayed the layers of community and figures in the church through church functions. The dialogue is often deeply ironic. A tragic undercurrent runs through some of the later novels, especially \"Quartet in Autumn\" and \"The Sweet Dove Died\".\nMore recently, critics have noted the serious engagement with anthropology that Pym's novels depict. The seemingly naive narrator Mildred Lathbury (\"Excellent Women\"), for example, actually engages in a kind of participant-observer form that represents a reaction to the structural functionalism of the Learned Society's focus on kinship diagrams. Tim Watson links Pym's acute awareness of the social changes in the apparently cosy world of her novels to a critique of functionalism's emphasis on static social structures.\nPym's novels are known for their intertextuality. All of Pym's novels contain frequent references to English poetry and literature, from medieval poetry to later work, including John Keats and Frances Greville.\nAdditionally, Pym's novels function as a shared universe, in which characters from one work cross over into another. Usually the reappearances are in the form of cameos, or mentions by other characters. For instance, the relationship between Mildred Lathbury and Everard Bone is left unconfirmed at the end of \"Excellent Women\" . However, the characters are referenced or appear in \"Jane and Prudence\", \"Less than Angels\" and \"An Unsuitable Attachment\", and their marriage and happiness are confirmed. Esther Clovis, a leading member of the anthropological community, appears first in \"Excellent Women\" and then in two other novels; after her death her memorial service is seen from the point of view of two (unrelated) characters in \"An Academic Question\" and \"A Few Green Leaves\". Esther Clovis is thought to have been inspired by Beatrice Wyatt, Pym's predecessor as assistant editor of \"Africa\".\nPopular culture and reputation.\nForewords to her novels have been written by A. N. Wilson, Jilly Cooper and Alexander McCall Smith.\nPhilip Larkin said, \"I'd sooner read a new Barbara Pym than a new Jane Austen\". Shirley Hazzard was a fan of Pym's work, which she described as \"penetrating, tender, and ... greatly daring\". The novelist Anne Tyler wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whom do people turn to when they've finished Barbara Pym? The answer is easy: they turn back to Barbara Pym.\nOn 19 February 1992, the British television series \"Bookmark\" broadcast an episode entitled \"Miss Pym's Day Out\", written and directed by James Runcie. The film follows Pym (played by Patricia Routledge) from dawn to evening on the day she attended the 1977 Booker Prize awards, for which \"Quartet in Autumn\" was nominated. The script includes excerpts from Pym's letters and diaries. Appearances by real-life figures, including Hilary Pym, Hazel Holt, Jilly Cooper, Tom Maschler and Penelope Lively, are contrasted with adapted excerpts from Pym's novels performed by actors. The film was nominated for a BAFTA Huw Wheldon award for Best Arts Programme and won the Royal Television Society award for Best Arts Programme.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" calls him \"arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history\".\nBorn in Lichfield, Staffordshire, he attended Pembroke College, Oxford, until lack of funds forced him to leave. After working as a teacher, he moved to London and began writing for \"The Gentleman's Magazine\". Early works include \"Life of Mr Richard Savage\", the poems \"London\" and \"The Vanity of Human Wishes\" and the play \"Irene\". After nine years' effort, Johnson's \"A Dictionary of the English Language\" appeared in 1755, and was acclaimed as \"one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship\". Later work included essays, an annotated \"The Plays of William Shakespeare\", and the apologue \"The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia\". In 1763 he befriended James Boswell, with whom he travelled to Scotland, as Johnson described in \"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland\". Near the end of his life came a massive, influential \"Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets\" of the 17th and 18th centuries.\nDr Johnson was a devout Anglican and a committed Tory. Though tall and robust, he displayed gestures and tics that disconcerted some on meeting him. Boswell's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\", along with other biographies, documented Johnson's behaviour and mannerisms in such detail that they have informed the posthumous diagnosis of Tourette syndrome, a condition not defined or diagnosed in the 18th century. After several illnesses, he died on the evening of 13 December 1784 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\nIn his later life Johnson became a celebrity, and following his death he was increasingly seen to have had a lasting effect on literary criticism, even being claimed to be the one truly great critic of English literature. A prevailing mode of literary theory in the 20th century drew from his views, and he had a lasting impact on biography. Johnson's \"Dictionary\" had far-reaching effects on Modern English, and was pre-eminent until the arrival of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" 150 years later. Boswell's \"Life\" was selected by Johnson biographer Walter Jackson Bate as \"the most famous single work of biographical art in the whole of literature\".\nLife and career.\nEarly life and education.\nSamuel Johnson was born on 18 September 1709 to bookseller Michael Johnson and his wife Sarah (n\u00e9e Ford). His mother was 40 when she gave birth to Johnson in the family home above his father's bookshop in Lichfield, Staffordshire. This was considered an unusually late pregnancy, so a man-midwife and surgeon of \"great reputation\" named George Hector was brought in to assist. The infant Johnson did not cry, and there were concerns for his health. His aunt exclaimed that \"she would not have picked such a poor creature up in the street\". The family feared that Johnson would not survive, and summoned the vicar of St Mary's to perform a baptism. Two godfathers were chosen, Samuel Swynfen, a physician and graduate of Pembroke College, Oxford, and Richard Wakefield, a lawyer, coroner and Lichfield town clerk.\nJohnson's health improved and he was put to wet-nurse with Joan Marklew. Some time later he contracted scrofula, known at the time as the \"King's Evil\" because it was thought that \"royal touch\" could cure it. Upon the recommendation of Sir John Floyer, former physician to King Charles II, the young Johnson was touched by Queen Anne on 30 March 1712. However, the ritual proved ineffective, and an operation was performed that left him with permanent scars across his face and body. Queen Anne gave Johnson an amulet on a chain he would wear the rest of his life.\nWhen Johnson was three, his brother Nathaniel was born. In a letter he wrote to his mother, Nathaniel complained that Johnson \"would scarcely ever use me with common civility.\" With the birth of Johnson's brother their father was unable to pay the debts he had accrued over the years, and the family was no longer able to maintain its standard of living.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n When he was a child in petticoats, and had learnt to read, Mrs. Johnson\none morning put the common prayer-book into his hands, pointed to the collect for the day, and said, 'Sam, you must get this by heart.' She went up stairs, leaving him to study it: But by the time she had reached the second floor, she heard him following her. 'What's the matter?' said she. 'I can say it,' he replied; and repeated it distinctly, though he could not have read it more than twice.\nBoswell's \"Life of Johnson\"\nJohnson displayed signs of great intelligence as a child, and his parents, to his later disgust, would show off his \"newly acquired accomplishments\". His education began at the age of three, and was provided by his mother, who had him memorise and recite passages from the \"Book of Common Prayer\". When Samuel turned four, he was sent to a nearby school, and, at the age of six he was sent to a retired shoemaker to continue his education. \nA year later Johnson went to Lichfield Grammar School, where he excelled in Latin. For his most personal poems, Johnson used Latin. During this time, Johnson started to exhibit the tics that would influence how people viewed him in his later years, and which formed the basis for a posthumous diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. He excelled at his studies and was promoted to the upper school at the age of nine. During this time, he befriended Edmund Hector, nephew of his \"man-midwife\" George Hector, and John Taylor, with whom he remained in contact for the rest of his life.\nAt the age of 16, Johnson stayed with his cousins, the Fords, at Pedmore, Worcestershire. There he became a close friend of Cornelius Ford, who employed his knowledge of the classics to tutor Johnson while he was not attending school. Ford was a successful, well-connected academic, and notorious alcoholic whose excesses contributed to his death six years later. After spending six months with his cousins, Johnson returned to Lichfield, but Hunter, the headmaster, \"angered by the impertinence of this long absence\", refused to allow Johnson to continue at the school. Unable to return to Lichfield Grammar School, Johnson enrolled at the King Edward VI grammar school at Stourbridge. As the school was located near Pedmore, Johnson was able to spend more time with the Fords, and he began to write poems and verse translations. He spent six months at Stourbridge before returning to his parents' home in Lichfield.\nDuring this time, Johnson's future remained uncertain because his father was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, and it is likely that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until his mother's cousin Elizabeth Harriotts died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, and Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at the college, offered to make up the deficit.\nJohnson made friends at Pembroke and read much. His tutor asked him to produce a Latin translation of Alexander Pope's \"Messiah\" as a Christmas exercise. Johnson completed half of the translation in one afternoon and the rest the following morning. Although the poem brought him praise, it did not bring the material benefit he had hoped for. The poem later appeared in \"Miscellany of Poems\" (1731), edited by John Husbands, a Pembroke tutor, and is the earliest surviving publication of any of Johnson's writings. Johnson spent the rest of his time studying, even during the Christmas holiday. He drafted a \"plan of study\" called \"Adversaria\", which he left unfinished, and used his time to learn French while working on his Greek.\nJohnson's tutor, Jorden, left Pembroke some months after Johnson's arrival, and was replaced by William Adams. Johnson enjoyed Adams's tutoring, but by December, was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and was forced to return to Lichfield without a degree, having spent 13 months at Oxford. He left behind many books that he had borrowed from his father because he could not afford to transport them, and also because he hoped to return.\nHe eventually did receive a degree. Just before the publication of his \"Dictionary\" in 1755, the University of Oxford awarded Johnson the degree of Master of Arts. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1765 by Trinity College Dublin and in 1775 by the University of Oxford. In 1776 he returned to Pembroke with Boswell and toured the college with his former tutor Adams, who by then was the Master of the college. During that visit he recalled his time at the college and his early career, and expressed his later fondness for Jorden.\nEarly career.\nLittle is known about Johnson's life between the end of 1729 and 1731. It is likely that he lived with his parents. He experienced bouts of mental anguish and physical pain during years of illness; his tics and gesticulations associated with Tourette syndrome became more noticeable and were often commented upon. By 1731 Johnson's father was deeply in debt and had lost much of his standing in Lichfield. Johnson hoped to obtain the position of a school usher, which became available at Stourbridge Grammar School, but since he did not have a degree, his application was passed over on 6 September 1731. \nAt about this time, Johnson's father became ill and developed an \"inflammatory fever\" which led to his death in December 1731 when Johnson was twenty-two. Devastated by his father's death, Johnson sought to atone for an occasion he did not go with his father to sell books. Johnson stood for a \"considerable time bareheaded in the rain\" in the spot his father's stall used to be. After the publication of Boswell's \"Life of Samuel Johnson,\" a statue was erected in that spot.\nJohnson eventually found employment as undermaster at a school in Market Bosworth, run by Sir Wolstan Dixie, who allowed Johnson to teach without a degree. Johnson was treated as a servant, and considered teaching boring, but nonetheless found pleasure in it. After an argument with Dixie he left the school, and by June 1732 he had returned home.\nJohnson continued to look for a position at a Lichfield school. After being turned down for a job at Ashbourne School, he spent time with his friend Edmund Hector, who was living in the home of the publisher Thomas Warren. At the time, Warren was starting his \"Birmingham Journal\", and he enlisted Johnson's help. This connection with Warren grew, and Johnson proposed a translation of Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo's account of the Abyssinians. Johnson read Abb\u00e9 Joachim Le Grand's French translations, and thought that a shorter version might be \"useful and profitable\". Instead of writing the work himself, he dictated to Hector, who then took the copy to the printer and made any corrections. Johnson's \"A Voyage to Abyssinia\" was published a year later. He returned to Lichfield in February 1734, and began an annotated edition of Poliziano's Latin poems, along with a history of Latin poetry from Petrarch to Poliziano; a \"Proposal\" was soon printed, but a lack of funds halted the project.\nJohnson remained with his close friend Harry Porter during a terminal illness, which ended in Porter's death on 3 September 1734. Porter's wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Jervis) (otherwise known as \"Tetty\") was now a widow at the age of 45, with three children. Some months later, Johnson began to court her. William Shaw, a friend and biographer of Johnson, claims that \"the first advances probably proceeded from her, as her attachment to Johnson was in opposition to the advice and desire of all her relations,\" Johnson was inexperienced in such relationships, but the well-to-do widow encouraged him and promised to provide for him with her substantial savings. They married on 9 July 1735, at St Werburgh's Church in Derby. The Porter family did not approve of the match, partly because of the difference in their ages: Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 46. Elizabeth's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he severed all relations with her. However, her daughter Lucy accepted Johnson from the start, and her other son, Joseph, later came to accept the marriage.\nIn June 1735, while working as a tutor for the children of Thomas Whitby, a local Staffordshire gentleman, Johnson had applied for the position of headmaster at Solihull School. Although Johnson's friend Gilbert Walmisley gave his support, Johnson was passed over because the school's directors thought he was \"a very haughty, ill-natured gent, and that he has such a way of distorting his face (which though he can't help) the gents think it may affect some lads\". With Walmisley's encouragement, Johnson decided that he could be a successful teacher if he ran his own school. In the autumn of 1735, Johnson opened Edial Hall School as a private academy at Edial, near Lichfield. He had only three pupils: Lawrence Offley, George Garrick, and the 18-year-old David Garrick, who later became one of the most famous actors of his day. The venture was unsuccessful and cost Tetty a substantial portion of her fortune. Instead of trying to keep the failing school going, Johnson began to write his first major work, the historical tragedy \"Irene\". Biographer Robert DeMaria believed that Tourette syndrome likely made public occupations like schoolmaster or tutor almost impossible for Johnson. This may have led Johnson to \"the invisible occupation of authorship\".\nJohnson left for London with his former pupil David Garrick on 2 March 1737, the day Johnson's brother died. He was penniless and pessimistic about their travel, but fortunately for them, Garrick had connections in London, and the two were able to stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris. Johnson soon moved to Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish \"Irene\". On 12 July 1737 he wrote to Edward Cave with a proposal for a translation of Paolo Sarpi's \"The History of the Council of Trent\" (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later. In October 1737 Johnson brought his wife to London, and he found employment with Cave as a writer for \"The Gentleman's Magazine\". His assignments for the magazine and other publishers during this time were \"almost unparalleled in range and variety,\" and \"so numerous, so varied and scattered\" that \"Johnson himself could not make a complete list\".\nIn May 1738 his first major work, the poem \"London\", was published anonymously. Based on Juvenal's , it describes the character Thales leaving for Wales to escape the problems of London, which is portrayed as a place of crime, corruption, and poverty. Johnson could not bring himself to regard the poem as earning him any merit as a poet. Alexander Pope said that the author \"will soon be d\u00e9terr\u00e9\" (unearthed, dug up), but this would not happen until 15 years later.\nIn August, Johnson's lack of an MA degree from Oxford or Cambridge led to his being denied a position as master of the Appleby Grammar School. In an effort to end such rejections, Pope asked Lord Gower to use his influence to have a degree awarded to Johnson. Gower petitioned Oxford for an honorary degree to be awarded to Johnson, but was told that it was \"too much to be asked\". Gower then asked a friend of Jonathan Swift to plead with Swift to use his influence at Trinity College Dublin to have a master's degree awarded to Johnson, in the hope that this could then be used to justify an MA from Oxford, but these efforts were again in vain, and unforthcoming.\nBetween 1737 and 1739, Johnson befriended poet Richard Savage. Feeling guilty of living almost entirely on Tetty's money, Johnson stopped living with her and spent his time with Savage. They were poor and would stay in taverns or sleep in \"night-cellars\". Some nights they would roam the streets until dawn because they had no money. During this period, Johnson and Savage worked as Grub Street writers who anonymously supplied publishers with on-demand material. In his \"Dictionary,\" Johnson defined \"grub street\" as \"the name of a street in Moorfields in London, much inhabited by writers of small histories, dictionaries, and temporary poems, whence any mean production is called \"grubstreet.\"\" Savage's friends tried to help him by attempting to persuade him to move to Wales, but Savage ended up in Bristol and again fell into debt. He was committed to debtors' prison and died in 1743. A year later, Johnson wrote \"Life of Mr Richard Savage\" (1744), a \"moving\" work which, in the words of the biographer and critic Walter Jackson Bate, \"remains one of the innovative works in the history of biography\".\n\"A Dictionary of the English Language\".\nIn 1746, a group of publishers approached Johnson with the idea of creating an authoritative dictionary of the English language. A contract with William Strahan and associates, worth 1,500 guineas, was signed on the morning of 18 June 1746. Johnson claimed that he could finish the project in three years. In comparison, the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise had 40 scholars spending 40 years to complete their dictionary, which prompted Johnson to claim, \"This is the proportion. Let me see; forty times forty is sixteen hundred. As three to sixteen hundred, so is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman.\" Although he did not succeed in completing the work in three years, he did manage to finish it in eight. Some criticised the dictionary, including the historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, who described Johnson as \"a wretched etymologist,\" but according to Bate, the \"Dictionary\" \"easily ranks as one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship, and probably the greatest ever performed by one individual who laboured under anything like the disadvantages in a comparable length of time.\"\nJohnson's constant work on the \"Dictionary\" disrupted his and Tetty's living conditions. He had to employ a number of assistants for the copying and mechanical work, which filled the house with incessant noise and clutter. He was always busy, and kept hundreds of books around him. John Hawkins described the scene: \"The books he used for this purpose were what he had in his own collection, a copious but a miserably ragged one, and all such as he could borrow; which latter, if ever they came back to those that lent them, were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning.\" Johnson's process included underlining words in the numerous books he wanted to include in his \"Dictionary\". The assistants would copy out the underlined sentences on individual paper slips, which would later be alphabetized and accompanied with examples. Johnson was also distracted by Tetty's poor health as she began to show signs of a terminal illness. To accommodate both his wife and his work, he moved to 17 Gough Square near his printer, William Strahan.\nIn preparation, Johnson wrote \"Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language\" in 1747, of which Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield was the patron, to Johnson's displeasure. Seven years after first meeting Johnson to go over the work, Chesterfield wrote two anonymous essays in \"The World\" recommending the \"Dictionary\". He complained that the English language lacked structure and argued in support of the dictionary. Johnson did not like the tone of the essays, and he felt that Chesterfield had not fulfilled his obligations as the work's patron. In a letter to Chesterfield, Johnson expressed this view and harshly criticised Chesterfield, saying \"Is not a patron, my lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had been kind: but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary and cannot impart it; till I am known and do not want it.\" Chesterfield, impressed by the language, kept the letter displayed on a table for anyone to read.\nThe \"Dictionary\" was finally published in April 1755, with the title page noting that the University of Oxford had awarded Johnson a Master of Arts degree in anticipation of the work. The dictionary as published was a large book. Its pages were nearly tall, and the book was wide when opened; it contained 42,773 entries, to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions, and it sold for the extravagant price of \u00a34 10s, perhaps the rough equivalent of \u00a3350 today. An important innovation in English lexicography was to illustrate the meanings of his words by literary quotation, of which there were approximately 114,000. The authors most frequently cited include William Shakespeare, John Milton and John Dryden. It was years before \"Johnson's Dictionary\", as it came to be known, turned a profit. Authors' royalties were unknown at the time, and Johnson, once his contract to deliver the book was fulfilled, received no further money from its sale. Years later, many of its quotations would be repeated by various editions of the \"Webster's Dictionary\" and the \"New English Dictionary\".\nJohnson's dictionary was not the first, nor was it unique. Other dictionaries, such as Nathan Bailey's \"Dictionarium Britannicum\", included more words, and in the 150 years preceding Johnson's dictionary about twenty other general-purpose monolingual \"English\" dictionaries had been produced. However, there was open dissatisfaction with the dictionaries of the period. In 1741, David Hume claimed: \"The Elegance and Propriety of Stile have been very much neglected among us. We have no Dictionary of our Language, and scarce a tolerable Grammar.\" Johnson's \"Dictionary\" offers insights into the 18th century and \"a faithful record of the language people used\". It is more than a reference book; it is a work of literature. It was the most commonly used and imitated for the 150 years between its first publication and the completion of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in 1928.\nJohnson also wrote numerous essays, sermons, and poems during his years working on the dictionary. In 1750, he decided to produce a series of essays under the title \"The Rambler\" that were to be published every Tuesday and Saturday and sell for twopence each. During this time, Johnson published no fewer than 208 essays, each around 1,200\u20131,500 words long. Explaining the title years later, he told his friend and portraitist Joshua Reynolds: \"I was at a loss how to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside, and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title. \"The Rambler\" seemed the best that occurred, and I took it.\" These essays, often on moral and religious topics, tended to be more grave than the title of the series would suggest; his first comments in \"The Rambler\" were to ask \"that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld from me, but that I may promote thy glory, and the salvation of myself and others.\" The popularity of \"The Rambler\" took off once the issues were collected in a volume; they were reprinted nine times during Johnson's life. Writer and printer Samuel Richardson, enjoying the essays greatly, questioned the publisher as to who wrote the works; only he and a few of Johnson's friends were told of Johnson's authorship. One friend, the novelist Charlotte Lennox, includes a defence of \"The Rambler\" in her novel \"The Female Quixote\" (1752). In particular, the character Mr. Glanville says, \"you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a \"Young\", a \"Richardson\", or a \"Johnson\". Rail with premeditated Malice at the \"Rambler\"; and for the want of Faults, turn even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule.\" (Book VI, Chapter XI) Later, the novel describes Johnson as \"the greatest Genius in the present Age.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHis necessary attendance while his play was in rehearsal, and during its performance, brought him acquainted with many of the performers of both sexes, which produced a more favourable opinion of their profession than he had harshly expressed in his Life of Savage. With some of them he kept up an acquaintance as long as he and they lived, and was ever ready to shew them acts of kindness. He for a considerable time used to frequent the Green Room, and seemed to take delight in dissipating his gloom, by mixing in the sprightly chit-chat of the motley circle then to be found there. Mr. David Hume related to me from Mr. Garrick, that Johnson at last denied himself this amusement, from considerations of rigid virtue; saying, 'I'll come no more behind your scenes, David; for the silk stockings and white bosoms of your actresses excite my amorous propensities.\nBoswell's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\"\nNot all of his work was confined to \"The Rambler\". His most highly regarded poem, \"The Vanity of Human Wishes\", was written with such \"extraordinary speed\" that Boswell claimed Johnson \"might have been perpetually a poet\". The poem is an imitation of Juvenal's \"\" and claims that \"the antidote to vain human wishes is non-vain spiritual wishes\". In particular, Johnson emphasises \"the helpless vulnerability of the individual before the social context\" and the \"inevitable self-deception by which human beings are led astray\". The poem was critically celebrated but it failed to become popular, and sold fewer copies than \"London\". In 1749, Garrick made good on his promise that he would produce \"Irene\", but its title was altered to \"Mahomet and Irene\" to make it \"fit for the stage.\" \"Irene,\" which was written in blank verse, was received rather poorly with a friend of Boswell's commenting the play to be \"as frigid as the regions of Nova Zembla: now and then you felt a little heat like what is produced by touching ice.\" The show eventually ran for nine nights.\nTetty Johnson was ill during most of her time in London, and in 1752 she decided to return to the countryside while Johnson was busy working on his \"Dictionary\". She died on 17 March 1752, and, at word of her death, Johnson wrote a letter to his old friend Taylor, which according to Taylor \"expressed grief in the strongest manner he had ever read\". Johnson wrote a sermon in her honour, to be read at her funeral, but Taylor refused to read it, for reasons which are unknown. This only exacerbated Johnson's feelings of loss and despair. Consequently, John Hawkesworth had to organise the funeral. Johnson felt guilty about the poverty in which he believed he had forced Tetty to live, and blamed himself for neglecting her. He became outwardly discontented, and his diary was filled with prayers and laments over her death which continued until his own. She was his primary motivation, and her death hindered his ability to complete his work.\nLater career.\nOn 16 March 1756, Johnson was arrested for an outstanding debt of \u00a35 18s. Unable to contact anyone else, he wrote to the writer and publisher Samuel Richardson. Richardson, who had previously lent Johnson money, sent him six guineas to show his good will, and the two became friends. Soon after, Johnson met and befriended the painter Joshua Reynolds, who so impressed Johnson that he declared him \"almost the only man whom I call a friend\". Reynolds's younger sister Frances observed during their time together \"that men, women and children gathered around him [Johnson]\", laughing at his gestures and gesticulations. In addition to Reynolds, Johnson was close to Bennet Langton and Arthur Murphy. Langton was a scholar and an admirer of Johnson who persuaded his way into a meeting with Johnson which led to a long friendship. Johnson met Murphy during the summer of 1754 after Murphy came to Johnson about the accidental republishing of the \"Rambler\" No. 190, and the two became friends. Around this time, Anna Williams began boarding with Johnson. She was a minor poet who was poor and becoming blind, two conditions that Johnson attempted to change by providing room for her and paying for a failed cataract surgery. Williams, in turn, became Johnson's housekeeper.\nTo occupy himself, Johnson began to work on \"The Literary Magazine, or Universal Review\", the first issue of which was printed on 19 March 1756. Philosophical disagreements erupted over the purpose of the publication when the Seven Years' War began and Johnson started to write polemical essays attacking the war. After the war began, the \"Magazine\" included many reviews, at least 34 of which were written by Johnson. When not working on the \"Magazine\", Johnson wrote a series of prefaces for other writers, such as Giuseppe Baretti, William Payne and Charlotte Lennox. Johnson's relationship with Lennox and her works was particularly close during these years, and she in turn relied so heavily upon Johnson that he was \"the most important single fact in Mrs Lennox's literary life\". He later attempted to produce a new edition of her works, but even with his support they were unable to find enough interest to follow through with its publication. To help with domestic duties while Johnson was busy with his various projects, Richard Bathurst, a physician and a member of Johnson's Club, pressured him to take on a freed slave, Francis Barber, as his servant.\nJohnson's work on \"The Plays of William Shakespeare\" took up most of his time. On 8 June 1756, Johnson published his \"Proposals for Printing, by Subscription, the Dramatick Works of William Shakespeare\", which argued that previous editions of Shakespeare were edited incorrectly and needed to be corrected. Johnson's progress on the work slowed as the months passed, and he told music historian Charles Burney in December 1757 that it would take him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, he was arrested again, for a debt of \u00a340, in February 1758. The debt was soon repaid by Jacob Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish \"Shakespeare\", and this encouraged Johnson to finish his edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his \"Shakespeare\" to prove his commitment to the project.\nIn 1758, Johnson began to write a weekly series, \"The Idler\", which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760, as a way to avoid finishing his \"Shakespeare\". This series was shorter and lacked many features of \"The Rambler\". Unlike his independent publication of \"The Rambler\", \"The Idler\" was published in a weekly news journal \"The Universal Chronicle\", a publication supported by John Payne, John Newbery, Robert Stevens and William Faden.\nSince \"The Idler\" did not occupy all Johnson's time, he was able to publish his philosophical novella \"Rasselas\" on 19 April 1759. The \"little story book\", as Johnson described it, describes the life of Prince Rasselas and Nekayah, his sister, who are kept in a place called the Happy Valley in the land of Abyssinia. The Valley is a place free of problems, where any desire is quickly satisfied. The constant pleasure does not, however, lead to satisfaction; and, with the help of a philosopher named Imlac, Rasselas escapes and explores the world to witness how all aspects of society and life in the outside world are filled with suffering. They return to Abyssinia, but do not wish to return to the state of constantly fulfilled pleasures found in the Happy Valley. \"Rasselas\" was written in one week to pay for his mother's funeral and settle her debts; it became so popular that there was a new English edition of the work almost every year. References to it appear in many later works of fiction, including \"Jane Eyre\", \"Cranford\" and \"The House of the Seven Gables\". Its fame was not limited to English-speaking nations: \"Rasselas\" was immediately translated into five languages (French, Dutch, German, Russian and Italian), and later into nine others.\nBy 1762, however, Johnson had gained notoriety for his dilatoriness in writing; the contemporary poet Churchill teased Johnson for the delay in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: \"He for subscribers baits his hook / and takes your cash, but where's the book?\" The comments soon motivated Johnson to finish his \"Shakespeare\", and, after receiving the first payment from a government pension on 20 July 1762, he was able to dedicate most of his time towards this goal. Earlier that July, the 24-year-old King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of \u00a3300 in appreciation for the \"Dictionary\". While the pension did not make Johnson wealthy, it did allow him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining 22 years of his life. The award came largely through the efforts of Sheridan and the Earl of Bute. When Johnson questioned if the pension would force him to promote a political agenda or support various officials, he was told by Bute that the pension \"is not given you for anything you are to do, but for what you have done\".\nOn 16 May 1763, Johnson first met 22-year-old James Boswell\u2014who would later become Johnson's first major biographer\u2014in the bookshop of Johnson's friend, Tom Davies. They quickly became friends, although Boswell would return to his home in Scotland or travel abroad for months at a time. Around the spring of 1763, Johnson formed \"The Club\", a social group that included his friends Reynolds, Burke, Garrick, Goldsmith and others (the membership later expanded to include Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon, in addition to Boswell himself). They decided to meet every Monday at 7:00\u00a0pm at the Turk's Head in Gerrard Street, Soho, and these meetings continued until long after the deaths of the original members.\nOn 9 January 1765, Murphy introduced Johnson to Henry Thrale, a wealthy brewer and MP, and his wife Hester. They struck up an instant friendship; Johnson was treated as a member of the family, and was once more motivated to continue working on his \"Shakespeare\". Afterwards, Johnson stayed with the Thrales for 17 years until Henry's death in 1781, sometimes staying in rooms at Thrale's Anchor Brewery in Southwark. Hester Thrale's documentation of Johnson's life during this time, in her correspondence and her diary (\"Thraliana\"), became an important source of biographical information on Johnson after his death.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDuring the whole of the interview, Johnson talked to his Majesty with profound respect, but still in his firm manly manner, with a sonorous voice, and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the drawing-room. After the King withdrew, Johnson shewed himself highly pleased with his Majesty's conversation and gracious behaviour. He said to Mr Barnard, 'Sir, they may talk of the King as they will; but he is the finest gentleman I have ever seen.'\nBoswell's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\"\nJohnson's edition of \"Shakespeare\" was finally published on 10 October 1765 as \"The Plays of William Shakespeare, in Eight Volumes\u00a0... To which are added Notes by Sam. Johnson\" in a printing of one thousand copies. The first edition quickly sold out, and a second was soon printed. The plays themselves were in a version that Johnson felt was closest to the original, based on his analysis of the manuscript editions. Johnson's revolutionary innovation was to create a set of corresponding notes that allowed readers to clarify the meaning behind many of Shakespeare's more complicated passages, and to examine those which had been transcribed incorrectly in previous editions. Included within the notes are occasional attacks upon rival editors of Shakespeare's works. Years later, Edmond Malone, an important Shakespearean scholar and friend of Johnson's, stated that Johnson's \"vigorous and comprehensive understanding threw more light on his authour than all his predecessors had done\".\nFinal works.\nOn 6 August 1773, eleven years after first meeting Boswell, Johnson set out to visit his friend in Scotland, and to begin \"a journey to the western islands of Scotland\", as Johnson's 1775 account of their travels would put it. That account was intended to discuss the social problems and struggles that affected the Scottish people, but it also praised many of the unique facets of Scottish society, such as a school in Edinburgh for the deaf and mute. Also, Johnson used the work to enter into the dispute over the authenticity of James Macpherson's Ossian poems, claiming they could not have been translations of ancient Scottish literature on the grounds that \"in those times nothing had been written in the Earse [i.e. Scots Gaelic] language\". There were heated exchanges between the two, and according to one of Johnson's letters, MacPherson threatened physical violence. Boswell's account of their journey, \"The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides\" (1786), was a preliminary step toward his later biography, \"The Life of Samuel Johnson\". Included were various quotations and descriptions of events, including anecdotes such as Johnson swinging a broadsword while wearing Scottish garb, or dancing a Highland jig.\nIn the 1770s, Johnson, who had tended to be an opponent of the government early in life, published a series of pamphlets in favour of various government policies. In 1770 he produced \"The False Alarm\", a political pamphlet attacking John Wilkes. In 1771, his \"Thoughts on the Late Transactions Respecting Falkland's Islands\" cautioned against war with Spain. In 1774 he printed \"The Patriot\", a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1775, he made the famous statement, \"Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.\" This line was not, as widely believed, about patriotism in general, but what Johnson considered to be the false use of the term \"patriotism\" by Wilkes and his supporters. Johnson opposed \"self-professed Patriots\" in general, but valued what he considered \"true\" patriotism.\nThe last of these pamphlets, \"Taxation No Tyranny\" (1775), was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a response to the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress, which protested against taxation without representation. Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had \"voluntarily resigned the power of voting\", but still retained virtual representation in Parliament. He also criticised the proslavery positions and ownership of slaves by the American Patriots, writing that if \"slavery be thus fatally contagious, how is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?\"\" Johnson argued that colonists who wished to participate in Parliament should move to England and purchase an estate. He denounced British supporters of the Patriot cause as \"traitors to this country\" and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but felt confident that it would ultimately end with \"English superiority and American obedience\". Years before, Johnson had stated that the French and Indian War was a conflict between \"two robbers\" of Native American lands, and that neither side deserved to live there. After the signing of the 1783 Treaty of Paris, marking the colonies' independence from Britain as the United States, Johnson stated that he was \"deeply disturbed\" with the \"state of this kingdom\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMr Thrale's death was a very essential loss to Johnson, who, although he did not foresee all that afterwards happened, was sufficiently convinced that the comforts which Mr Thrale's family afforded him, would now in great measure cease.\nBoswell's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\"\nOn 3 May 1777, while Johnson was trying and failing to save Reverend William Dodd from execution for forgery, he wrote to Boswell that he was busy preparing a \"little Lives\" and \"little Prefaces, to a little edition of the English Poets\". Tom Davies, William Strahan and Thomas Cadell had asked Johnson to create this final major work, the \"Lives of the English Poets\", for which he asked 200 guineas, an amount significantly less than the price he could have demanded. The \"Lives\", which were critical as well as biographical studies, appeared as prefaces to selections of each poet's work, and they were longer and more detailed than originally expected. The work was finished in March 1781 and the whole collection was published in six volumes. As Johnson justified in the advertisement for the work, \"my purpose was only to have allotted to every Poet an Advertisement, like those which we find in the French Miscellanies, containing a few dates and a general character.\"\nJohnson was unable to enjoy this success because Henry Thrale, the dear friend with whom he lived, died on 4 April 1781. Life changed quickly for Johnson when Hester Thrale became romantically involved with the Italian singing teacher Gabriel Mario Piozzi, which forced Johnson to change his previous lifestyle. After returning home and then travelling for a short period, Johnson received word that his friend and tenant Robert Levet, had died on 17 January 1782. Johnson was shocked by the death of Levet, who had resided at Johnson's London home since 1762. Shortly afterwards Johnson caught a cold that developed into bronchitis and lasted for several months. His health was further complicated by \"feeling forlorn and lonely\" over Levet's death, and by the deaths of his friend Thomas Lawrence and his housekeeper Williams.\nFinal years.\nAlthough he had recovered his health by August, Johnson experienced emotional trauma when he was given word that Hester Thrale would sell the residence that Johnson shared with the family. What hurt Johnson most was the possibility that he would be left without her constant company. Months later, on 6 October 1782, Johnson attended church for the final time in his life, to say goodbye to his former residence and life. The walk to the church strained him, but he managed the journey unaccompanied. While there, he wrote a prayer for the Thrale family:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To thy fatherly protection, O Lord, I commend this family. Bless, guide, and defend them, that they may pass through this world, as finally to enjoy in thy presence everlasting happiness, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.\nHester Thrale did not completely abandon Johnson, and asked him to accompany the family on a trip to Brighton. He agreed, and was with them from 7 October to 20 November 1782. On his return, his health began to fail, and he was left alone after Boswell's visit on 29 May 1783.\nOn 17 June 1783, Johnson's poor circulation resulted in a stroke and he wrote to his neighbour, Edmund Allen, that he had lost the ability to speak. Two doctors were brought in to aid Johnson; he regained his ability to speak two days later. Johnson feared that he was dying, and wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The black dog I hope always to resist, and in time to drive, though I am deprived of almost all those that used to help me. The neighbourhood is impoverished. I had once Richardson and Lawrence in my reach. Mrs. Allen is dead. My house has lost Levet, a man who took interest in everything, and therefore ready at conversation. Mrs. Williams is so weak that she can be a companion no longer. When I rise my breakfast is solitary, the black dog waits to share it, from breakfast to dinner he continues barking, except that Dr. Brocklesby for a little keeps him at a distance. Dinner with a sick woman you may venture to suppose not much better than solitary. After dinner, what remains but to count the clock, and hope for that sleep which I can scarce expect. Night comes at last, and some hours of restlessness and confusion bring me again to a day of solitude. What shall exclude the black dog from an habitation like this?\nBy this time he was sick and gout-ridden. He had surgery for gout, and his remaining friends, including novelist Fanny Burney (the daughter of Charles Burney), came to keep him company. He was confined to his room from 14 December 1783 to 21 April 1784.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA few days before his death, he had asked Sir John Hawkins, one of his executors, where he should be buried; and on being answered, \"Doubtless, in Westminster Abbey,\" seemed to feel a satisfaction, very natural to a Poet.\nBoswell's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\"\nHis health began to improve by May 1784, and he travelled to Oxford with Boswell on 5 May 1784. By July, many of Johnson's friends were either dead or gone; Boswell had left for Scotland and Hester Thrale had become engaged to Piozzi. With no one to visit, Johnson expressed a desire to die in London and arrived there on 16 November 1784. On 25 November 1784, he allowed Burney to visit him and expressed an interest to her that he should leave London; he soon left for Islington, to George Strahan's home. His final moments were filled with mental anguish and delusions; when his physician, Thomas Warren, visited and asked him if he were feeling better, Johnson burst out with: \"No, Sir; you cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death.\"\nMany visitors came to see Johnson as he lay sick in bed, but he preferred only Langton's company. Burney waited for word of Johnson's condition, along with Windham, Strahan, Hoole, Cruikshank, Des Moulins and Barber. On 13 December 1784, Johnson met with two others: a young woman, Miss Morris, whom Johnson blessed, and Francesco Sastres, an Italian teacher, who heard some of Johnson's final words: \"iam moriturus\" (\"now [I am] about to die\"). Shortly afterwards he fell into a coma, and died at 7:00\u00a0p.m.\nLangton waited until 11:00\u00a0p.m. to tell the others, which led to John Hawkins' becoming pale and overcome with \"an agony of mind\", along with Seward and Hoole describing Johnson's death as \"the most awful sight\". Boswell remarked, \"My feeling was just one large expanse of Stupor\u00a0... I could not believe it. My imagination was not convinced.\" William Gerard Hamilton joined in and stated, \"He has made a chasm, which not only nothing can fill up, but which \"nothing has a tendency to fill up\". \u2013Johnson is dead.\u2013 Let us go to the next best: There is nobody; \u2013\"no man can be said to put you in mind of Johnson\".\"\nHe was buried on 20 December 1784 at Westminster Abbey with an inscription that reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLiterary criticism.\nJohnson's works, especially his \"Lives of the Poets\" series, describe various features of excellent writing. He believed that the best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposely archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's \"Lycidas\" were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.\nIn his smaller poetic works, Johnson relied on short lines and filled his work with a feeling of empathy, which possibly influenced Housman's poetic style. In \"London\", his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, \"The Vanity of Human Wishes\", is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and argues that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.\nWhen it came to biography, Johnson disagreed with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that could be viewed as tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of \"Rambler\" 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his \"Lives of the Poets\" he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in \"Idler\" 84 he writes that a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.\nJohnson's thoughts on biography and on poetry coalesced in his understanding of what would make a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism. This was especially true of his \"Dictionary\" of which he wrote: \"I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, \"for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style\"\". Although a smaller edition became the household standard, Johnson's original \"Dictionary\" was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from what he considered to be the most important literary fields: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the \"Dictionary\" so that a reader could understand what words in literary works meant in context.\nJohnson did not attempt to create schools of theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature. Instead, he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature. When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language: \"If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them\".\nHis works on Shakespeare were devoted not merely to Shakespeare, but to understanding literature as a whole; in his \"Preface\" to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including what he saw as lack of morality, vulgarity, carelessness in crafting plots, and occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.\nViews and character.\nJohnson's tall and robust figure combined with his odd gestures were confusing to some; when William Hogarth first saw Johnson standing near a window in Richardson's house, \"shaking his head and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous manner\", Hogarth thought Johnson an \"ideot, whom his relations had put under the care of Mr. Richardson\". Hogarth was quite surprised when \"this figure stalked forwards to where he and Mr. Richardson were sitting and all at once took up the argument\u00a0... [with] such a power of eloquence, that Hogarth looked at him with astonishment, and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inspired\". \nBeyond appearance, Adam Smith claimed that \"Johnson knew more books than any man alive\", while Edmund Burke thought that if Johnson were to join Parliament, he \"certainly would have been the greatest speaker that ever was there\". Johnson relied on a unique form of rhetoric, and he is well known for his \"refutation\" of Bishop Berkeley's immaterialism, his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist: during a conversation with Boswell, Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, \"I refute it \"thus\"!\"\nJohnson was a devout, conservative Anglican and a compassionate man who supported a number of poor friends under his own roof, even when unable to fully provide for himself. Johnson's Christian morality permeated his works, and he would write on moral topics with such authority and in such a trusting manner that, Walter Jackson Bate claims, \"no other moralist in history excels or even begins to rival him\". However, as Donald Greene points out, Johnson's moral writings do not contain \"a predetermined and authorized pattern of 'good behavior'\", even though Johnson does emphasise certain kinds of conduct. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAfter we came out of the church, we stood talking for some time together of Bishop Berkeley's ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal. I observed, that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute it. I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it, 'I refute it \"thus\".'\nBoswell's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\"\nHe did not let his own faith prejudice him against others, and had respect for those of other denominations who demonstrated a commitment to Christian beliefs. Although Johnson respected Milton's poetry, he could not tolerate Milton's Puritan and Republican beliefs, feeling that they were contrary to England and Christianity. He was an opponent of slavery on moral grounds, and once proposed a toast to the \"next rebellion of the Negroes in the West Indies\". Beside his beliefs concerning humanity, Johnson is also known for his love of cats, especially his own two cats, Hodge and Lily. Boswell wrote, \"I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat.\"\nJohnson was also known as a staunch Tory; he admitted to sympathies for the Jacobite cause during his younger years but, by the reign of George III, he came to accept the Hanoverian succession. It was Boswell who gave people the impression that Johnson was an \"arch-conservative\", and it was Boswell, more than anyone else, who determined how Johnson would be seen by people years later. However, Boswell was not around for two of Johnson's most politically active periods: during Walpole's control over British Parliament and during the Seven Years' War. Although Boswell was present with Johnson during the 1770s and describes four major pamphlets written by Johnson, he neglects to discuss them because he is more interested in their travels to Scotland. This is compounded by the fact that Boswell held an opinion contrary to two of these pamphlets, \"The False Alarm\" and \"Taxation No Tyranny\", and so attacks Johnson's views in his biography.\nIn his \"Life of Samuel Johnson\" Boswell referred to Johnson as 'Dr. Johnson' so often that he would always be known as this, even though he hated being so called. Boswell's emphasis on Johnson's later years shows him too often as merely an old man discoursing in a tavern to a circle of admirers. Although Boswell, a Scotsman, was his close companion and friend, Johnson, like many in England, held hostile views on Scotland and its people. During his journey through Scotland with Boswell, Johnson \"exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism\". Hester Thrale, summarising Johnson's views on Scotland, stated \"We all know how well he loved to abuse the Scotch, &amp; indeed to be abused by them in return.\"\nHealth.\nJohnson had several health problems, including childhood tuberculous scrofula resulting in deep facial scarring, deafness in one ear and blindness in one eye, gout, testicular cancer, and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had emphysema along with cardiac failure probably due to hypertension, a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and Tourette syndrome.\nThere are many accounts of Johnson suffering from bouts of depression and what Johnson thought might be madness. As Walter Jackson Bate puts it, \"one of the ironies of literary history is that its most compelling and authoritative symbol of common sense\u2014of the strong, imaginative grasp of concrete reality\u2014should have begun his adult life, at the age of twenty, in a state of such intense anxiety and bewildered despair that, at least from his own point of view, it seemed the onset of actual insanity\". To overcome these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not seem to help. Taylor said that Johnson \"at one time strongly entertained thoughts of suicide\". Boswell claimed that Johnson \"felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible melancholia, with perpetual irritation, fretfulness, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and despair, which made existence misery\".\nEarly on, when Johnson was unable to pay off his debts, he began to work with professional writers and identified his own situation with theirs. During this time, Johnson witnessed Christopher Smart's decline into \"penury and the madhouse\", and feared that he might share the same fate. Hester Thrale Piozzi claimed, in a discussion on Smart's mental state, that Johnson was her \"friend who feared an apple should intoxicate him\". To her, what separated Johnson from others who were placed in asylums for madness\u2014like Christopher Smart\u2014was his ability to keep his concerns and emotions to himself.\nTwo hundred years after Johnson's death, the posthumous diagnosis of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements. According to Boswell \"he commonly held his head to one side\u00a0... moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand\u00a0... [H]e made various sounds\" like \"a half whistle\" or \"as if clucking like a hen\", and \"... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a whale.\" \nThere are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to \"perform his gesticulations\" at the threshold of a house or in doorways. When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: \"From bad habit.\" The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report, and Tourette syndrome researcher Arthur K. Shapiro described Johnson as \"the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome\". Details provided by the writings of Boswell, Hester Thrale, and others reinforce the diagnosis, with one paper concluding:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Johnson] also displayed many of the obsessional-compulsive traits and rituals which are associated with this syndrome\u00a0... It may be thought that without this illness Dr Johnson's remarkable literary achievements, the great dictionary, his philosophical deliberations and his conversations may never have happened; and Boswell, the author of the greatest of biographies would have been unknown.\nLegacy.\nJohnson was, in the words of Steven Lynn, \"more than a well-known writer and scholar\"; he was a celebrity, for the activities and the state of his health in his later years were constantly reported in various journals and newspapers, and when there was nothing to report, something was invented. According to Bate, \"Johnson loved biography,\" and he \"changed the whole course of biography for the modern world. One by-product was the most famous single work of biographical art in the whole of literature, Boswell's \"Life of Johnson\", and there were many other memoirs and biographies of a similar kind written on Johnson after his death.\" \nThese accounts of his life include Thomas Tyers's \"A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson\" (1784); Boswell's \"The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides\" (1785); Hester Thrale's \"Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson\", which drew on entries from her diary and other notes; John Hawkins's \"Life of Samuel Johnson\", the first full-length biography of Johnson; and, in 1792, Arthur Murphy's \"An Essay on the Life and Genius of Samuel Johnson\", which replaced Hawkins's biography as the introduction to a collection of Johnson's \"Works\". Another important source was Fanny Burney, who described Johnson as \"the acknowledged Head of Literature in this kingdom\" and kept a diary containing details missing from other biographies. Above all, Boswell's portrayal of Johnson is the work best known to general readers. Although critics like Donald Greene argue about its status as a true biography, the work became successful as Boswell and his friends promoted it at the expense of the many other works on Johnson's life.\nIn criticism, Johnson had a lasting influence, although not everyone viewed him favourably. Some, like Macaulay, regarded Johnson as an idiot savant who produced some respectable works, and others, like the Romantic poets, were completely opposed to Johnson's views on poetry and literature, especially with regard to Milton. However, some of their contemporaries disagreed: Stendhal's \"Racine et Shakespeare\" is based in part on Johnson's views of Shakespeare, and Johnson influenced Jane Austen's writing style and philosophy. Later, Johnson's works came into favour, and Matthew Arnold, in his \"Six Chief Lives from Johnson's \"Lives of the Poets\"\", considered the \"Lives\" of Milton, Dryden, Pope, Addison, Swift, and Gray as \"points which stand as so many natural centres, and by returning to which we can always find our way again\".\nMore than a century after his death, literary critics such as G. Birkbeck Hill and T. S. Eliot came to regard Johnson as a serious critic. They began to study Johnson's works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and \"Lives of the Poets\". Yvor Winters claimed that \"A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson\". F. R. Leavis agreed and, on Johnson's criticism, said, \"When we read him we know, beyond question, that we have here a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature. This, we can say with emphatic conviction, really \"is\" criticism\". Edmund Wilson claimed that \"The \"Lives of the Poets\" and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare are among the most brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism\".\nThe critic Harold Bloom placed Johnson's work firmly within the Western canon, describing him as \"unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him\u00a0... Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know, emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an \"activity\", one that will turn to destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour.\" Johnson's philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid-20th century.\nHalf of Johnson's surviving correspondence, together with some of his manuscripts, editions of his books, paintings and other items associated with him are in the Donald and Mary Hyde Collection of Dr. Samuel Johnson, housed at Houghton Library at Harvard University since 2003. The collection includes drafts of his \"Plan for a Dictionary\", documents associated with Hester Thrale Piozzi and James Boswell (including corrected proofs of his \"Life of Johnson\") and a teapot owned by Johnson.\nThere are many societies formed around and dedicated to the study and enjoyment of Samuel Johnson's life and works. On the bicentennial of Johnson's death in 1984, Oxford University held a week-long conference featuring 50 papers, and the Arts Council of Great Britain held an exhibit of \"Johnsonian portraits and other memorabilia\". The London \"Times\" and \"Punch\" produced parodies of Johnson's style for the occasion. In 1999, the BBC Four television channel started the Samuel Johnson Prize, an award for non-fiction. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque, unveiled in 1876, marks Johnson's Gough Square house. In 2009, Johnson was among the ten people selected by the Royal Mail for their \"Eminent Britons\" commemorative postage stamp issue. On 18 September 2017 Google commemorated Johnson's 308th birthday with a Google Doodle. The date of his death, 13 December, is commemorated in the Church of England's Calendar of Saints. There is a memorial to him at St Paul's Cathedral in London.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn-text citations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
