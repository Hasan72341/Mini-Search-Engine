It was one of the last-known non-avian dinosaurs and lived until the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. The name \"Triceratops\", which means 'three-horned face', is derived from the Ancient Greek words ('), meaning \"three\", ('), meaning \"horn\", and (\"\"), meaning \"face\".\nBearing a large bony frill, three horns on the skull, and a large, four-legged body, exhibiting convergent evolution with rhinoceroses, \"Triceratops\" is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best-known ceratopsian. It was also one of the largest, measuring around long and weighing up to . It shared the landscape with and was most likely preyed upon by \"Tyrannosaurus\". The functions of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have inspired countless debates. Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent interpretations find it probable that these features were primarily used in species identification, courtship, and dominance display, much like the antlers and horns of modern ungulates. \n\"Triceratops\" was traditionally placed within the \"short-frilled\" ceratopsids, but modern cladistic studies show it to be a member of Chasmosaurinae, which usually have long frills. Two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, are considered valid today. Seventeen different species, however, have been named throughout history. Research published in 2010 argued that the contemporaneous \"Torosaurus\", a ceratopsid long regarded as a separate genus, represents \"Triceratops\" in its mature form. This view has been highly disputed, with some morphometric research and the apparent existence of authentic \"Torosaurus\" subadults favoring the distinctness of the two genera, according to newer studies.\n\"Triceratops\" has been documented by numerous remains collected since the genus was first described in 1889 by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. Specimens representing life stages from hatchling to adult have been found. As the archetypal ceratopsian, \"Triceratops\" is one of the most beloved, popular dinosaurs and has been featured in numerous films, postage stamps, and many other media types.\nDiscovery and identification.\nThe first named fossil specimen now attributed to \"Triceratops\" is a pair of brow horns attached to a skull roof that were found by George Lyman Cannon near Denver, Colorado, in the spring of 1887. This specimen was sent to Othniel Charles Marsh, who believed that the formation from which it came dated from the Pliocene and that the bones belonged to a particularly large and unusual bison, which he named \"Bison alticornis\". He realized that there were horned dinosaurs by the next year, which saw his publication of the genus \"Ceratops\" from fragmentary remains, but he still believed \"B.\u00a0alticornis\" to be a Pliocene mammal. It took a third and much more complete skull to fully change his mind.\nAlthough not confidently assignable, fossils possibly belonging to \"Triceratops\" were described as two taxa, \"Agathaumas sylvestris\" and \"Polyonax mortuarius\", in 1872 and 1874, respectively, by Marsh's archrival Edward Drinker Cope. \"Agathaumas\" was named based on a pelvis, several vertebrae, and a few ribs collected by Fielding Bradford Meek and Henry Martyn Bannister near the Green River of southeastern Wyoming from layers coming from the Maastrichtian Lance Formation. Due to the fragmentary nature of the remains, it can only confidently be assigned to Ceratopsidae. \"Polyonax mortuarius\" was collected by Cope himself in 1873 from northeastern Colorado, possibly coming from the Maastrichtian Denver Formation. The fossils only consisted of fragmentary horn cores, 3 dorsal vertebrae, and fragmentary limb elements. \"Polyonax\" has the same issue as \"Agathaumas\", with the fragmentary remains non-assignable beyond Ceratopsidae.\nThe \"Triceratops\" holotype, YPM 1820, was collected in 1888 from the Lance Formation of Wyoming by fossil hunter John Bell Hatcher, but Marsh initially described this specimen as another species of \"Ceratops\". Cowboy Edmund B. Wilson had been startled by the sight of a monstrous skull poking out of the side of a ravine. He tried to recover it by throwing a lasso around one of the horns. When it broke off, the skull tumbling to the bottom of the cleft, Wilson brought the horn to his boss. His boss was rancher and avid fossil collector Charles Arthur Guernsey, who just so happened to show it to Hatcher. Marsh subsequently ordered Hatcher to locate and salvage the skull. The holotype was first named \"Ceratops horridus\". When further preparation uncovered the third nose horn, Marsh changed his mind and gave the piece the new generic name \"Triceratops\" (lit.\u2009'three horn face'), accepting his \"Bison alticornis\" as another species of \"Ceratops\". It would, however, later be added to \"Triceratops\".\nSpecies.\nAfter \"Triceratops\" was described, between 1889 and 1891, Hatcher collected another thirty-one of its skulls with great effort. The first species had been named \"T.\u00a0horridus\" by Marsh. Its specific name was derived from the Latin word meaning \"rough\" or \"rugose\", perhaps referring to the type specimen's rough texture, later identified as an aged individual. The additional skulls varied to a lesser or greater degree from the original holotype. This variation is unsurprising, given that \"Triceratops\" skulls are large three-dimensional objects from individuals of different ages and both sexes that which were subjected to different amounts and directions of pressure during fossilization.\nIn the first attempt to understand the many species, Richard Swann Lull found two groups, although he did not say how he distinguished them. One group composed of \"T.\u00a0horridus\", \"T.\u00a0prorsus\", and \"T.\u00a0brevicornus\" ('the short-horned'). The other composed of \"T.\u00a0elatus\" and \"T.\u00a0calicornis\". Two species (\"T.\u00a0serratus\" and \"T.\u00a0flabellatus\") stood apart from these groups. By 1933, alongside his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher\u2013Marsh\u2013Lull monograph of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage of \"T.\u00a0obtusus\" and \"T.\u00a0hatcheri\" ('Hatcher's') that was characterized by a very small nasal horn. \"T. horridus\u2013T. prorsus\u2013T. brevicornus\" was now thought to be the most conservative lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size. \"T. elatus\u2013T. calicornis\" was defined by having large brow horns and small nasal horns. Charles\u00a0Mortram Sternberg made one modification by adding \"T.\u00a0eurycephalus\" ('the wide-headed') and suggesting that it linked the second and third lineages closer together than they were to the \"T.\u00a0horridus\" lineage.\nWith time, the idea that the differing skulls might be representative of individual variation within one (or two) species gained popularity. In 1986, John Ostrom and Peter Wellnhofer published a paper in which they proposed that there was only one species, \"Triceratops horridus\". Part of their rationale was that there are generally only one or two species of any large animal in a region. To their findings, Thomas Lehman added the old Lull\u2013Sternberg lineages combined with maturity and sexual dimorphism, suggesting that the \"T. horridus\u2013T. prorsus\u2013T. brevicornus\" lineage was composed of females, the \"T. calicornis\u2013T. elatus\" lineage was made up of males, and the \"T. obtusus\u2013T. hatcheri\" lineage was of pathologic old males.\nThese findings were contested a few years later by paleontologist Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed \"Triceratops\" material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, \"T.\u00a0horridus\" and \"T.\u00a0prorsus\", although the distinctive skull of \"T.\"\u00a0(\"Nedoceratops\") \"hatcheri\" differed enough to warrant a separate genus. She found that \"T.\u00a0horridus\" and several other species belonged together and that \"T.\u00a0prorsus\" and \"T.\u00a0brevicornus\" stood alone. Since there were many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant the two groups were two species. It is still possible to interpret the differences as representing a single species with sexual dimorphism.\nIn 2009, John Scannella and Denver Fowler supported the separation of \"T.\u00a0prorsus\" and \"T.\u00a0horridus\", noting that the two species are also separated stratigraphically within the Hell Creek Formation, indicating that they did not live together at the same time.\nSynonyms and doubtful species.\nSome of the following species are synonyms, as indicated in parentheses (\"=\"T.\u00a0horridus\"\" or \"=\"T.\u00a0prorsus\"\"). All the others are each considered a (lit.\u2009'dubious name') because they are based on remains too poor or incomplete to be distinguished from pre-existing \"Triceratops\" species.\nDescription.\nSize.\n\"Triceratops\" was a very large animal, measuring around in length and weighing up to . A specimen of \"T.\u00a0horridus\" named Kelsey measured long, has a skull, stood about tall, and was estimated by the Black Hills Institute to weigh approximately .\nSkull.\nLike all chasmosaurines, \"Triceratops\" had a large skull relative to its body size, among the largest of all land animals. The largest-known skull, specimen MWC 7584 (formerly BYU 12183), is estimated to have been in length when complete and could reach almost a third of the length of the entire animal.\nThe front of the head was equipped with a large beak in front of its teeth. The core of the top beak was formed by a special rostral bone. Behind it, the premaxillae bones were located, embayed from behind by very large, circular nostrils. In chasmosaurines, the premaxillae met on their midline in a complex bone plate, the rear edge of which was reinforced by the \"narial strut\". From the base of this strut, a triangular process jutted out into the nostril. \"Triceratops\" differs from most relatives in that this process was hollowed out on the outer side. Behind the toothless premaxilla, the maxilla bore thirty-six to forty tooth positions, in which three to five teeth per position were vertically stacked. The teeth were closely appressed, forming a \"dental battery\" curving to the inside. The skull bore a single horn on the snout above the nostrils. In \"Triceratops\", the nose horn is sometimes recognisable as a separate ossification, the epinasal.\nThe skull also featured a pair of supraorbital \"brow\" horns approximately long, with one above each eye. The jugal bones pointed downward at the rear sides of the skull and were capped by separate epijugals. With \"Triceratops\", these were not particularly large and sometimes touched the quadratojugals. The bones of the skull roof were fused and by a folding of the frontal bones, a \"double\" skull roof was created. In \"Triceratops\", some specimens show a fontanelle, an opening in the upper roof layer. The cavity between the layers invaded the bone cores of the brow horns.\nAt the rear of the skull, the outer squamosal bones and the inner parietal bones grew into a relatively short, bony frill, adorned with epoccipitals in young specimens. These were low triangular processes on the frill edge, representing separate skin ossifications or osteoderms. Typically, with \"Triceratops\" specimens, there are two epoccipitals present on each parietal bone, with an additional central process on their border. Each squamosal bone had five processes. Most other ceratopsids had large parietal fenestrae, openings in their frills, but those of \"Triceratops\" were noticeably solid, unless the genus \"Torosaurus\" represents mature \"Triceratops\" individuals, which it most likely does not. Under the frill, at the rear of the skull, a huge occipital condyle, up to in diameter, connected the head to the neck.\nThe lower jaws were elongated and met at their tips in a shared epidentary bone, the core of the toothless lower beak. In the dentary bone, the tooth battery curved to the outside to meet the battery of the upper jaw. At the rear of the lower jaw, the articular bone was exceptionally wide, matching the general width of the jaw joint. \"T.\u00a0horridus\" can be distinguished from \"T.\u00a0prorsus\" by having a shallower snout.\nPostcranial skeleton.\nChasmosaurines showed little variation in their postcranial skeleton. The skeleton of \"Triceratops\" is markedly robust. Both \"Triceratops\" species possessed a very sturdy build, with strong limbs, short hands with three hooves each, and short feet with four hooves each. The vertebral column consisted of ten neck, twelve back, ten sacral, and about forty-five tail vertebrae. The front neck vertebrae were fused into a syncervical. Traditionally, this was assumed to have incorporated the first three vertebrae, thus implying that the frontmost atlas was very large and sported a spinous process (the spike-like piece of bone that extends dorsally which combined have a ridge or keel-like appearance). Later interpretations revived an old hypothesis by John Bell Hatcher that, at the very front, a vestige of the real atlas can be observed, the syncervical then consisting of four vertebrae. The vertebral count mentioned is adjusted to this view. In \"Triceratops\", the spinous processes of the neck are constant in height and don't gradually slope upwards. Another peculiarity is that the neck ribs only begin to lengthen with the ninth cervical vertebra.\nThe rather short and high vertebrae of the back were, in its middle region, reinforced by ossified tendons running along the tops of the vertebral arches (the band of bone that encloses the spinal canal). The straight sacrum (the part of the spine at the pelvis) was long and adult individuals show a fusion of all sacral vertebrae. In \"Triceratops\" the first four and last two sacrals had transverse processes (sideways outgrowths), connecting the vertebral column to the pelvis, that were fused at their distal ends. Sacrals seven and eight had longer processes, causing the sacrum to have an oval profile in top view. On top of the sacrum, a carapace-like bone plate was formed by a fusion of the spinous processes of the second through fifth vertebrae. \"Triceratops\" had a large pelvis with a long ilium. The ischium was curved downwards.\nAlthough certainly quadrupedal, the posture of horned dinosaurs has long been the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at a considerable angle from the thorax in order to better bear the weight of the head. This stance can be seen in paintings by Charles Knight and Rudolph Zallinger. Ichnological evidence in the form of trackways from horned dinosaurs and recent reconstructions of skeletons (both physical and digital) seem to show that \"Triceratops\" and other ceratopsids maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion, with the elbows flexed to behind and slightly bowed out, in an intermediate state between fully upright and fully sprawling, comparable to the modern rhinoceros. Tracks of a large ceratopsian from the Upper Cretaceous Laramie Formation of Colorado given the name \"Ceratopsipes goldenensis\" may have been made by \"Triceratops\" (or the closely related \"Torosaurus\"). \nThe hands and forearms of \"Triceratops\" retained a fairly primitive structure when compared to other quadrupedal dinosaurs, such as thyreophorans and many sauropods. In those two groups, the forelimbs of quadrupedal species were usually rotated so that the hands faced forward with palms backward (\"pronated\") as the animals walked. \"Triceratops\", like other ceratopsians and related quadrupedal ornithopods (together forming the Cerapoda), walked with most of their fingers pointing out and away from the body, the original condition for dinosaurs. This was also retained by bipedal forms, like theropods. In \"Triceratops\", the weight of the body was carried by only the first three fingers of the hand, while digits 4 and 5 were vestigial and lacked claws or hooves. The phalangeal formula of the hand is 2-3-4-3-1, meaning that the first or innermost finger of the forelimb has two bones, the next has three, the next has four, etc.\nSkin.\nPreserved skin found along with the \"Triceratops\" nicknamed \"Lane\" was unearthed on a ranch in Wyoming in 2002 and put on display with the mounted skeleton at the Houston Museum of Natural Science in Texas. The fossilized actual skin (rather than a skin impression) consists of large scales, some of which exceed 100 millimetres (3.9 in) across, which have conical projections rising from their center, suggesting the possible presence of bristles or quills. A preserved piece of skin from the frill of a specimen is also known, which consists of small polygonal basement scales.\nClassification.\n\"Triceratops\" is the best-known genus of Ceratopsidae, a family of large, mostly North American ceratopsians. The exact relationship of \"Triceratops\" among the other ceratopsids has been debated over the years. Confusion stemmed mainly from the combination of a short, solid frill (similar to that of Centrosaurinae), with long brow horns (more akin to Chasmosaurinae). In the first overview of ceratopsians, R. S. Lull hypothesized the existence of two lineages, one of \"Monoclonius\" and \"Centrosaurus\" leading to \"Triceratops\", the other with \"Ceratops\" and \"Torosaurus\", making \"Triceratops\" a centrosaurine as the group is understood today. Later revisions supported this view when Lawrence Lambe, in 1915, formally describing the first, short-frilled group as Centrosaurinae (including \"Triceratops\"), and the second, long-frilled group as Chasmosaurinae.\nIn 1949, Charles Mortram Sternberg was the first to question this position, proposing instead that \"Triceratops\" was more closely related to \"Arrhinoceratops\" and \"Chasmosaurus\" based on skull and horn features, making \"Triceratops\" a chasmosaurine (\"ceratopsine\" in his usage) genus. He was largely ignored, with John Ostrom and later David Norman placing \"Triceratops\" within the Centrosaurinae.\nSubsequent discoveries and analyses, however, proved the correctness of Sternberg's view on the position of \"Triceratops\", with Thomas Lehman defining both subfamilies in 1990 and diagnosing \"Triceratops\" as \"ceratopsine\" on the basis of several morphological features. Apart from the one feature of a shortened frill, \"Triceratops\" shares no derived traits with centrosaurines. Further research by Peter Dodson, including a 1990 cladistic analysis and a 1993 study using resistant-fit theta-rho analysis, or RFTRA (a morphometric technique which systematically measures similarities in skull shape), reinforces \"Triceratops\"' placement as a chasmosaurine.\nThe cladogram below follows Longrich (2014), who named a new species of \"Pentaceratops\", and included nearly all species of chasmosaurine.\nFor many years after its discovery, the deeper evolutionary origins of \"Triceratops\" and its close relatives remained largely obscure. In 1922, the newly discovered \"Protoceratops\" was seen as its ancestor by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but many decades passed before additional findings came to light. Recent years have been fruitful for the discovery of several antecedents of \"Triceratops\". \"Zuniceratops\", the earliest-known ceratopsian with brow horns, was described in the late 1990s, and \"Yinlong\", the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, was described in 2005.\nThese new finds have been vital in illustrating the origins of ceratopsians in general, suggesting an Asian origin in the Jurassic and the appearance of truly horned ceratopsians by the beginning of the Late Cretaceous in North America.\nIn phylogenetic taxonomy, the genus \"Triceratops\" has been used as a reference point in the definition of Dinosauria. Dinosaurs have been designated as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of \"Triceratops\" and modern birds. Furthermore, Ornithischia has been defined as those dinosaurs more closely related to \"Triceratops\" than to modern birds.\nPaleobiology.\nAlthough \"Triceratops\" is commonly portrayed as a herding animal, there is currently little evidence to suggest that they lived in herds. While several other ceratopsians are known from bone beds preserving bones from two to hundreds or even thousands of individuals, there is currently only one documented bonebed dominated by \"Triceratops\" bones: a site in southeastern Montana with the remains of three juveniles. It may be significant that only juveniles were present. In 2012, a group of three \"Triceratops\" in relatively complete condition, each of varying sizes from a full-grown adult to a small juvenile, were found near Newcastle, Wyoming. The remains are currently under excavation by paleontologist Peter Larson and a team from the Black Hills Institute. It is believed that the animals were traveling as a family unit, but it remains unknown if the group consists of a mated pair and their offspring, or two females and a juvenile they were caring for. The remains also show signs of predation or scavenging from \"Tyrannosaurus\", particularly on the largest specimen, with the bones of the front limbs showing breakage and puncture wounds from \"Tyrannosaurus\" teeth. In 2020, Illies and Fowler described the co-ossified distal caudal vertebrae of \"Triceratops\". According to them, this pathology could have arisen after one \"Triceratops\" accidentally stepped on the tail of another member of the herd.\nFor many years, \"Triceratops\" finds were known only from solitary individuals. These remains are very common. For example, Bruce Erickson, a paleontologist of the Science Museum of Minnesota, has reported having seen 200 specimens of \"T.\u00a0prorsus\" in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. Similarly, Barnum Brown claimed to have seen over 500 skulls in the field. Because \"Triceratops\" teeth, horn fragments, frill fragments, and other skull fragments are such abundant fossils in the Lancian faunal stage of the late Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, 66\u00a0mya) of western North America, it is regarded as one of the dominant herbivores of the time, if not the most dominant. In 1986, Robert Bakker estimated it as making up five sixths of the large dinosaur fauna at the end of the Cretaceous. Unlike most animals, skull fossils are far more common than postcranial bones for \"Triceratops\", suggesting that the skull had an unusually high preservation potential.\nAnalysis of the endocranial anatomy of \"Triceratops\" suggest its sense of smell was poor compared to that of other dinosaurs. Its ears were attuned to low frequency sounds, given the short cochlear lengths recorded in an analysis by Sakagami \"et al,\". This same study also suggests that \"Triceratops\" held its head about 45 degrees to the ground, an angle which would showcase the horns and frill most effectively that simultaneously allowed the animal to take advantage of food through grazing.\nA 2022 study by Wiemann and colleagues of various dinosaur genera, including \"Triceratops\", suggests that it had an ectothermic (cold blooded) or gigantothermic metabolism, on par with that of modern reptiles. This was uncovered using the spectroscopy of lipoxidation signals, which are byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation and correlate with metabolic rates. They suggested that such metabolisms may have been common for ornithischian dinosaurs in general, with the group evolving towards ectothermy from an ancestor with an endothermic (warm blooded) metabolism. An isotopic analysis study by Rooij and colleagues suggested that \"Triceratops\" was gigantothermic, if not endothermic due to its large body volume. The very same study conducted by Wiemann et al., revealed that \"Triceratops\" lived in environments that consisted of floodplains and inland forests.\nDentition and diet.\n\"Triceratops\" were herbivorous and, because of their low-slung head, their primary food was probably low-growing vegetation, although they may have been able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and sheer bulk. The jaws were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.\n\"Triceratops\" teeth were arranged in groups called batteries, which contained 36 to 40 tooth columns in each side of each jaw and 3 to 5 stacked teeth per column, depending on the size of the animal. This gives a range of 432 to 800 teeth, of which only a fraction were in use at any given time (as tooth replacement was continuous throughout the life of the animal). They functioned by shearing in a vertical to near-vertical orientation. Additionally, their teeth wore as they fed, creating fullers that minimised friction as they masticated. The great size and numerous teeth of \"Triceratops\" suggests that they ate large volumes of fibrous plant material. Other plants that were a part of its diet included \"Populus\" plants, Pine plants, \"Platanus\" plants, \"Hazel\" plants, and \"Taxodium\" plants. Some researchers suggest it, along with its cousin \"Torosaurus\" ate palms and cycads and others suggest it ate ferns, which then grew in prairies. Studies of the isotopes of ceratopsian and hadrosaur teeth revealed that \"Triceratops\" and \"Edmontosaurus\" respectively engaged in niche partitioning.\nFunctions of the horns and frill.\nThere has been much speculation over the functions of \"Triceratops\"' head adornments. The two main theories have revolved around use in combat and in courtship display, with the latter now thought to be the most likely primary function.\nEarly on, Lull postulated that the frills may have served as anchor points for the jaw muscles to aid chewing by allowing increased size and power for the muscles. This has been put forward by other authors over the years, but later studies do not find evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.\n\"Triceratops\" were long thought to have used their horns and frills in combat with large predators, such as \"Tyrannosaurus\", the idea being discussed first by Charles H. Sternberg in 1917 and 70 years later by Robert Bakker. There is evidence that \"Tyrannosaurus\" did have aggressive head-on encounters with \"Triceratops\", based on partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a \"Triceratops\" brow horn and squamosal. The bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. Which animal was the aggressor, however, is unknown. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that, in a battle against a bull \"Tyrannosaurus\", the \"Triceratops\" had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the \"Tyrannosaurus\" using its sharp horns. \"Tyrannosaurus\" is also known to have fed on \"Triceratops\", as shown by a heavily tooth-scored \"Triceratops\" ilium and sacrum.\nIn addition to combat with predators using its horns, \"Triceratops\" are popularly shown engaging each other in combat with horns locked. While studies show that such activity would be feasible, if unlike that of present-day horned animals, there is disagreement about whether they did so. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on \"Triceratops\" skulls (and the skulls of other ceratopsids) are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study finds no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (with there being no evidence of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes. A 2009 study compared incidence rates of skull lesions and periosteal reaction in \"Triceratops\" and \"Centrosaurus\", showing that these were consistent with \"Triceratops\" using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in \"Centrosaurus\" may indicate visual use over physical use of cranial ornamentation or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head. The frequency of injury was found to be 14% in \"Triceratops\". The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease. Histological examination reveals that the frill of \"Triceratops\" is composed of fibrolamellar bone. This contains fibroblasts that play a critical role in wound healing and is capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling.\nOne skull was found with a hole in the jugal bone, apparently a puncture wound sustained while the animal was alive, as indicated by signs of healing. The hole has a diameter close to that of the distal end of a \"Triceratops\" horn. This and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians have been cited as evidence of non-fatal intra-specific competition in these dinosaurs. Another specimen, referred to as \"Big John\", has a similar fenestra to the squamosal caused by what appears to be another \"Triceratops\" horn and the squamosal bone shows signs of significant healing, further vindicating the hypothesis that this ceratopsian used its horns for intra-specific combat.\nThe large frill also may have helped to increase body area to regulate body temperature. A similar theory has been proposed regarding the plates of \"Stegosaurus\", although this use alone would not account for the bizarre and extravagant variation seen in different members of Ceratopsidae, which would rather support the sexual display theory.\nThe theory that frills functioned as a sexual display was first proposed by Davitashvili in 1961 and has gained increasing acceptance since. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or other social behavior, can be seen in the ceratopsians differing markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them similarly. A 2006 study of the smallest \"Triceratops\" skull, ascertained to be that of a juvenile, shows the frill and horns developed at a very early age, predating sexual development. That would suggest they were probably important for visual communication and species recognition in general. However, the use of the exaggerated structures to enable dinosaurs to recognize their own species has been questioned, as no such function exists for such structures in modern species.\nGrowth and ontogeny.\nIn 2006, the first extensive ontogenetic study of \"Triceratops\" was published in the journal \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\". The study, by John R. Horner and Mark Goodwin, found that individuals of \"Triceratops\" could be divided into four general ontogenetic groups: babies, juveniles, subadults, and adults. With a total number of 28 skulls studied, the youngest was only long. Ten of the 28 skulls could be placed in order in a growth series with one representing each age. Each of the four growth stages were found to have identifying features. Multiple ontogenetic trends were discovered, including the size reduction of the epoccipitals, development and reorientation of postorbital horns, and hollowing out of the horns. Big John, one of the \"Triceratops\", is estimated to have lived around 60 years when he died.\n\"Torosaurus\" as growth stage of \"Triceratops\".\n\"Torosaurus\" is a ceratopsid genus first identified from a pair of skulls in 1891, two years after the identification of \"Triceratops\" by Othneil Charles Marsh. The genus \"Torosaurus\" resembles \"Triceratops\" in geological age, distribution, anatomy, and size, so it has been recognised as a close relative. Its distinguishing features are an elongated skull and the presence of two ovular fenestrae in the frill. Paleontologists investigating dinosaur ontogeny in Montana's Hell Creek Formation have recently presented evidence that the two represent a single genus.\nJohn Scannella, in a paper presented in Bristol at the conference of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (September 25, 2009), reclassified \"Torosaurus\" as especially mature \"Triceratops\" individuals, perhaps representing a single sex. Horner, Scannella's mentor at Bozeman Campus, Montana State University, noted that ceratopsian skulls consist of metaplastic bone. A characteristic of metaplastic bone is that it lengthens and shortens over time, extending and resorbing to form new shapes. Significant variety is seen even in those skulls already identified as \"Triceratops\", Horner said, \"where the horn orientation is backwards in juveniles and forward in adults\". Approximately 50% of all subadult \"Triceratops\" skulls have two thin areas in the frill that correspond with the placement of \"holes\" in \"Torosaurus\" skulls, suggesting that holes developed to offset the weight that would otherwise have been added as maturing \"Triceratops\" individuals grew longer frills. A paper describing these findings in detail was published in July 2010 by Scannella and Horner. It formally argues that \"Torosaurus\" and the similar contemporary \"Nedoceratops\" are synonymous with \"Triceratops\".\nThe assertion has since ignited much debate. Andrew Farke had, in 2006, stressed that no systematic differences could be found between \"Torosaurus\" and \"Triceratops\", apart from the frill. He nevertheless disputed Scannella's conclusion by arguing in 2011 that the proposed morphological changes required to \"age\" a \"Triceratops\" into a \"Torosaurus\" would be without precedent among ceratopsids. Such changes would include the growth of additional epoccipitals, reversion of bone texture from an adult to immature type and back to adult again, and growth of frill holes at a later stage than usual. A study by Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Field analyzed 35 specimens of both \"Triceratops\" and \"Torosaurus\". The authors concluded that \"Triceratops\" individuals too old to be considered immature forms are represented in the fossil record, as are \"Torosaurus\" individuals too young to be considered fully mature adults. The synonymy of \"Triceratops\" and \"Torosaurus\" cannot be supported, they said, without more convincing intermediate forms than Scannella and Horner initially produced. Scannella's \"Triceratops\" specimen with a hole on its frill, they argued, could represent a diseased or malformed individual rather than a transitional stage between an immature \"Triceratops\" and mature \"Torosaurus\" form.\nIn 2013, Farke and Leonardo Maiorino published morphometric research, a statistical analysis of the (shape space) describing the variation of the \"Torosaurus\", \"Triceratops horridus\", \"Triceratops prorsus\", and \"Nedoceratops\" skulls correlated with maturation. They concluded that \"Torosaurus latus\" skulls throughout maturation retained a different form from \"T. horridus\" and \"T. prorsus\", the last two species showing an overlapping in their proportions. This is even true when the frill shape is disregarded. \"Nedoceratops\" proved, except for size, not to be a plausible transitional form between \"Torosaurus\" and \"Triceratops horridus\". Farke and Maiorino admitted that the low number of \"Torosaurus\" specimens reduced the reliability of these results, but concluded that \"Torosaurus\" and \"Triceratops\" were separate taxa, though allowing for the possibility of anagenesis, i.e. the several taxa forming a single chronospecies line of descent, given the lack of good stratigraphic data. The morphometric study was inconclusive on the point of \"Torosaurus utahensis\", for which most specimens consist of isolated bones, with its morphospace falling in between \"Triceratops\" and \"Torosaurus latus\" and not well separated from either.\nResearchers have claimed that distinct juvenile \"Torosaurus\" have been excavated from a bonebed in the Javelina Formation of Big Bend National Park, basing their identification as \"Torosaurus\" cf. \"utahensis\" on their proximity to an adult with a characteristic \"Torosaurus\" parietal. In 2022, Mallon \"et al.\" argued that two specimens found in Canada's Frenchman and Scollard Formations, EM P16.1. (at Eastend Historical Museum in Saskatchewan) and UALVP 1646 (at the University of Alberta), are subadults and can be referred to \"Torosaurus\", this indicating that it is a valid taxon. The same study also noted that \"Torosaurus\" indeed lived during the Late Maastrichtian (contemporaneously with \"Triceratops\").\nOther genera as growth stages of \"Triceratops\".\nOpinion has varied on the validity of a separate genus for \"Nedoceratops\". Scannella and Horner regarded it as an intermediate growth stage between \"Triceratops\" and \"Torosaurus\". Farke, in his 2011 redescription of the only known skull, concluded that it was an aged individual of its own valid taxon, \"Nedoceratops hatcheri\". Longrich and Fields also did not consider it a transition between \"Torosaurus\" and \"Triceratops\", suggesting that the frill holes were pathological.\nAs described above, Scannella had argued in 2010 that \"Nedoceratops\" should be considered a synonym of \"Triceratops\". Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Longrich agreed with Scannella about \"Nedoceratops\" and made a further suggestion that the recently described \"Ojoceratops\" was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from the \"Triceratops horridus\" specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species \"Triceratops serratus\".\nLongrich observed that another newly described genus, \"Tatankaceratops\", displayed a strange mix of characteristics already found in adult and juvenile \"Triceratops\". Rather than representing a distinct genus, \"Tatankaceratops\" could as easily represent a dwarf \"Triceratops\" or a \"Triceratops\" individual with a developmental disorder that caused it to stop growing prematurely.\nPaleoecology.\n\"Triceratops\" lived during the Late Cretaceous of western North America, its fossils coming from the Evanston Formation, Scollard Formation, Laramie Formation, Lance Formation, Denver Formation, and Hell Creek Formation. These fossil formations date back to the time of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, which has been dated to 66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 million years ago. Many animals and plants have been found in these formations, but mostly from the Lance Formation and Hell Creek Formation. \"Triceratops\" was one of the last ceratopsian genera to appear before the end of the Mesozoic. The related \"Torosaurus\" and more distantly related diminutive \"Leptoceratops\" were also present, though their remains have been rarely encountered. Isotopic analysis suggests \"Triceratops\" specimens from DTB (Darnell \"Triceratops\" Bonebed) could've inhabited freshwater floodplains, although the it likely wasn't restricted to one environment.\nTheropods from these formations include genera of dromaeosaurids, tyrannosaurids, ornithomimids, troodontids, avialans, and caenagnathids. Dromaeosaurids from the Hell Creek Formation are \"Acheroraptor\" and \"Dakotaraptor\". Indeterminate dromaeosaurs are known from other fossil formations. Common teeth previously referred to \"Dromaeosaurus\" and \"Saurornitholestes\" were considered to be those of \"Acheroraptor\". The tyrannosaurids from the formation are \"Nanotyrannus\" and \"Tyrannosaurus\". Among ornithomimids are the genera \"Struthiomimus\" and \"Ornithomimus\". An undescribed animal named \"Orcomimus\" could be from the formation. Troodontids are only represented by \"Pectinodon\" and \"Paronychodon\" in the Hell Creek Formation with a possible species of \"Troodon\" from the Lance Formation. One species of unknown coelurosaur is known from teeth in the Hell Creek and similar formations by a single species, \"Richardoestesia\". Oviraptorosaurs from the Hell Creek Formation include \"Anzu\"., and avialans include \"Avisaurus\", multiple species of \"Brodavis\", and several other species of hesperornithoforms, as well as several species of true birds, including \"Cimolopteryx\".\nOrnithischians are abundant in the Scollard, Laramie, Lance, Denver, and Hell Creek Formation. The main groups of ornithischians are ankylosaurians, ornithopods, ceratopsians, and pachycephalosaurians. Three ankylosaurians are known: \"Ankylosaurus\", \"Denversaurus\", and possibly a species of \"Edmontonia\" or an undescribed genus. Multiple genera of ceratopsians are known from the formation other than \"Triceratops\". These include the leptoceratopsid \"Leptoceratops\" and the chasmosaurine ceratopsids \"Torosaurus\", \"Nedoceratops\", and \"Tatankaceratops\". Ornithopods are common in the Hell Creek Formation and are known from several species of the thescelosaurine \"Thescelosaurus\" and the hadrosaurid \"Edmontosaurus\". Several pachycephalosaurians have been found in the Hell Creek Formation and in similar formations. Among them are the derived pachycephalosaurids \"Stygimoloch\", \"Dracorex\", \"Pachycephalosaurus\", \"Sphaerotholus\", and an undescribed specimen from North Dakota. The first two might be junior synonyms of \"Pachycephalosaurus\".\nMammals are plentiful in the Hell Creek Formation. Groups represented include multituberculates, metatherians, and eutherians. The multituberculates represented include \"Paracimexomys,\" the cimolomyids \"Paressonodon\", \"Meniscoessus\", \"Essonodon\", \"Cimolomys\", \"Cimolodon\", and \"Cimexomys\", and the neoplagiaulacids \"Mesodma\" and \"Neoplagiaulax\". The metatherians are represented by the alphadontids \"Alphadon\", \"Protalphodon\", and \"Turgidodon\", the pediomyids \"Pediomys\", \"Protolambda\", and \"Leptalestes\", the stagodontid \"Didelphodon\", the deltatheridiid \"Nanocuris\", the herpetotheriid \"Nortedelphys\", and the glasbiid \"Glasbius\". A few eutherians are known, being represented by \"Alostera\", \"Protungulatum\", the cimolestids \"Cimolestes\" and \"Batodon\", the gypsonictopsid \"Gypsonictops\", and the possible nyctitheriid \"Paranyctoides\".\nCultural significance.\nSince at least the early 20th century, \"Triceratops\" has been among the most famous dinosaurs and an archetypal ceratopsian. It has been popularly displayed at natural history museums due to the abundance of fossils. A mounted \"Triceratops\" skeleton was exhibited at the 1900 Paris Exposition, possibly the earliest display of the dinosaur, and was seen by 21,000 visitors during the first two days. Similarly, a model \"Triceratops\" by American sculptor Louis Paul Jonas was displayed at the 1964 New York World's Fair.\n\"Triceratops\" is a staple of dinosaur films including \"The Lost World\" (1925) and \"Jurassic Park\" (1993). In literature, they appear as \"Gryfs\" in Edgar Rice Burroughs's 1921 novel \"Tarzan the Terrible\", while the 1956 children's book \"The Enormous Egg\" by Oliver Butterworth features a \"Triceratops\" hatching from a chicken egg. After \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Stegosaurus\", it has been the most frequently depicted dinosaur on stamps. \"Triceratops\" is the official state fossil of South Dakota and the official state dinosaur of Wyoming.\nIn 1928, Charles R. Knight painted a mural incorporating a confrontation between a \"Tyrannosaurus\" and a \"Triceratops\" in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, establishing them as enemies in the popular imagination. Paleontologist Robert Bakker said of the imagined rivalry between \"Tyrannosaurus\" and \"Triceratops\", \"No matchup between predator and prey has ever been more dramatic. It's somehow fitting that those two massive antagonists lived out their co-evolutionary belligerence through the last days of the last epoch of the Age of Dinosaurs.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most common variation has a frame with a saddle, and has a pedal-driven direct-drive. A two speed hub is commercially available for faster unicycling. Unicycling is practiced professionally in circuses, by street performers, in festivals, and as a hobby. Unicycles have also been used to create new sports such as unicycle basketball and unicycle hockey. In recent years, unicycles have also been used in mountain unicycling, an activity similar to mountain biking or trials.\nHistory.\nUS patents for single-wheeled 'velocipedes' were published in 1869 by Frederick Myers and in 1881 by Battista Scuri.\nUnicycle design has developed since the penny-farthing and later the advent of the first unicycle into many variations including: the seatless unicycle (\"ultimate wheel\") the tall (\"giraffe\") unicycle and \"2-wheelers\" or \"3-wheelers\" (multiple wheels stacked directly on top of each other). During the late 1980s some extreme sportsmen took an interest in the unicycle and modified unicycles to enable them to engage in off-road or mountain unicycling, trials unicycling and street unicycling.\nUnicycles compared to other pedal powered vehicles.\nBicycles, tricycles and quadracycles share (with minor variations) several basic parts including wheels, pedals, cranks, forks, and the saddle with unicycles.\nWithout a rider, unicycles lack stability \u2013 however, a proficient unicyclist is usually more stable than a similarly proficient rider on a bicycle as the wheel is not constrained by the linear axis of a frame.\nUnicycles usually, but not always, lack brakes, gears, and the ability to freewheel. Given these differences, the injuries that can occur from unicycle use tend to be different from that of bicycle use. In particular, head injuries are significantly less likely among unicycle use compared to bicycle use.\nConstruction.\nUnicycles have a few key parts:\nThe wheel is usually similar to a bicycle wheel with a special hub designed so the axle is a fixed part of the hub. This means the rotation of the cranks directly controls the rotation of the wheel (called direct-drive). The frame sits on top of the axle bearings, while the cranks attach to the ends of the axle, and the seatpost slides into the frame to allow the saddle to be height adjusted.\nTypes of unicycles.\nTypes of unicycle include:\nEach type has many combinations of frame strength, wheel diameter, and crank length.\nFreestyle unicycles.\nGenerally used for flatland skills and freestyle routines, freestyle unicycles typically have a relatively high seatpost, a narrow saddle, and a squared fork (used for one-footed tricks). These unicycles are used similarly to flatland bicycles. Wheel size is usually , but smaller riders may use unicycles. Some people prefer wheels. Many freestyle unicyclists will use white tires to avoid tire marks when riding indoors.\nTrials unicycles.\nDesigned for unicycle trials, these unicycles are stronger than standard unicycles in order to withstand the stresses caused by jumping, dropping, and supporting the weight of the unicycle and rider on components such as the pedals and cranks. Many trials unicycles also have wide, knobby tires to absorb some of the impact on drops.\nMountain unicycles (\"MUnis\").\nMountain unicycling (abbreviated to muni or MUni) consists of riding specialized unicycles on mountain bike trails or otherwise off-roading. Mountain unicycles have thicker, wider tires for better traction. Riders may occasionally lower air pressure for increased shock absorption. Many riders choose to use long cranks to increase power when riding up hills and over rough terrain. A disc brake is sometimes used for descents; the brake handle is attached to the underside of the handle on the front of the saddle.\nTouring/commuter unicycles.\nUsed for long distances, these unicycles are specially made to cover distances. They have a large wheel diameter, between , so more distance is covered in less pedal rotation. A unicycle made by the Coker Tire company started the big wheel trend. Some variations on the traditional touring unicycle include the Schlumpf \"GUni\" (geared unicycle), which uses a two-speed internal fixed-geared hub. Larger direct-drive wheels tend to have shorter cranks to allow for easier cadence and more speed. Geared wheels, with an effective diameter larger than the wheel itself, tend to use longer cranks to increase torque as they are not required to achieve such high cadences as direct-drive wheels, but demand greater force per pedal stroke.\nTraining aids.\nTraining aids are sometimes used to make it easier to become comfortable with riding a unicycle. One method for training is using a spotter to make riding easier. Another method is finding a narrow hallway that can be used to help alleviate left and right balancing while allowing a beginner to focus on forward and backward balance. Equally, riding back and forth between two chairs, faced back to back, while holding on to the chair backs allows the user to gauge how to appropriately position oneself before setting off. Using props such as sticks or ski poles is generally discouraged as they hinder balance and create dependence. A fall onto props could also cause serious injury.\nRiding styles.\nTraditionally, unicycling has been seen as a circus skill which has been performed at events to entertain the public in the circus or during parades, carnivals or street festivals. Recent developments in the strength and durability of bicycle (and consequently unicycle) parts have given rise to many new activities including trials of unicycling and mountain unicycling. Unicycling is arguably now as much a competitive sport and recreational pursuit as an entertainment activity.\nThe principal types of unicycling are:\nUnicycle team sports.\nUnicycling is also performed as a team sport.\nUnicycle basketball.\nUnicycle basketball uses a regulation basketball on a regular basketball court with almost the same rules, e.g., one must dribble the ball while riding. There are a number of rules that are particular to unicycle basketball as well, e.g., a player must be mounted on the unicycle when in-bounding the ball. Unicycle basketball is usually played using 24-inch (up to 640mm) or smaller unicycles, and using plastic pedals, both to preserve the court and the players' shins. In North America, regular unicycle basketball games are organized in Berkeley, San Luis Obispo, Newbury (OH). Switzerland, France and Puerto Rico have competitive teams. The Puerto Rico All Star Unicycling Basketball Team has been one of the dominant teams and has won several world championships.\nUnicycle hockey.\nUnicycle hockey follows rules similar to rink hockey, using a tennis ball and ice-hockey sticks. Play is mostly non-contact. The sport has active leagues in Germany, Switzerland, Australia and the UK and international tournaments held at least bi-annually. Tournaments in the UK are held by various teams across the country usually in sports halls, but occasionally outside. Each tournament lasts a day and around 8 teams normally compete in a round-robin league with the winner being whoever has the most points. If two teams have the same number of points the winner can be decided by goal difference or a penalty shoot-out.\nUNICON and regional championships.\nUNICON, Eurocycle and APUC are regular international unicycling conventions.\nThe biennial UNICON (International Unicycling Convention), sanctioned by the International Unicycling Federation, comprises all major unicycling disciplines and is a major event on the international unicycling calendar. Events include: artistic (group, pairs, individual, standard skill, open-X), track racing (, , , walk the wheel, one-foot), IUF slalom, , marathon (), muni (cross-country, uphill, downhill, North Shore downhill), trials, basketball and hockey.\nThe Eurocycle (EUROpean uniCYCLE meeting) is a similar convention but based in Europe.\nAPUC, the Asia Pacific Unicycle Championships, are held biannually, alternately with Unicon. The first APUC, in 2007, was in Singapore. Subsequently, the event has been held in Hong Kong (2009), Seoul (2011), Canberra (2013), and Singapore (2015).\nEUC, the Extreme Unicycle Championship, is the convention for urban unicycling (Street, Trials and Flatland). The event is held in two editions: summer and winter. Winter EUC is usually held at Cologne, Germany, while locations of the summer edition vary.\nNAUCC, The North American Unicycle Competition and Convention is the annual gathering of North American unicyclists. Unicyclists of all ages join together for competitions in a variety of disciplines, including freestyle, muni (mountain unicycling), road racing, team events, track, and urban. Topping off the week are convention events, including workshops and the Unicycling Society of America annual meeting.\nRaces.\nThe world's first multi-stage unicycle race, Ride the Lobster, took place in Nova Scotia in June 2008. Some 35 teams from 14 countries competed over a total distance of . Each team consisted of a maximum of 3 riders and 1 support person.\nUnicross, or unicycle cyclocross is an emerging race format in which unicycles race over a cyclocross course.\nManufacturers.\nUnicycle makers include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Mountain unicycling (muni or municycling) is undertaken on similar terrain to mountain biking. However, muni requires much more attention to the microfeatures of the short distance in front of the wheel. Unicycles' lack of a freewheel means that descents must be controlled all the way, and the typical lack of a gear system (though two-gear hubs are available) prevents the rider from reaching high speeds. Muni usually takes place on specially designed unicycles, which are equipped with strong hubs, large, knobbly tires, high-grip pedals and rugged frames. Some are also equipped with rim or disc brakes, having the lever mounted under the nose of the saddle. The brake primarily helps to compensate the downhill-slope force, while more expert riders also use it to decelerate or stop.\nMuni riders also need a few additional skills than required for either mountain biking or regular unicycling, with core strength, endurance and balance being key.\nSkills.\nThe ability to stall (rock the cranks back and forth while remaining in the same location) and bunny hop (hop up and down while remaining in the same location) are helpful.\nHighspeed gliding is a technique to rush down a smooth path with the feet off the pedals and braking with one shoe on the top of the tire.\nEquipment.\nThe unicycle typically has broad tires with grippy profile, filled with medium air pressure. The grippy pedals may have a tilt front contour (viewed from the side). The cranks should not be too long \u2013 relative to the rim size \u2013 to maintain clearance from bigger stones on the ground. Rims are rather broad to be sturdy and may have bores between the spoke holes to save weight, as a typical trial bike wheel. The banana saddle is fixed (not spring suspended) on the fork and carries a front and back bumper made of stiff plastics. The front bumper is used by three fingers from underneath as a handle, when the rider jumps or dismounts \u2013 or falls.\nThe rider wears shoes with grip and uses a helmet and protectors at shins, knees and at least gloves on the hands.\nA helmet camera needs a wide angle lens and picture stabilization, because the rider makes sudden and quick head movements to watch the trail.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54416", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54416", "title": "Trolleybus", "text": "Electric bus taking power from overhead wires\nA trolleybus (also known as trolley bus, trolley coach, trackless trolley, trackless tram (in the 1910s and 1920s), road tram or simply trolley) is an electric bus that draws power from dual overhead lines (generally suspended from roadside posts) using spring-loaded or pneumatically raised trolley poles. Two wires, and two trolley poles, are required to complete the electrical circuit. This differs from a tram or streetcar, which normally uses the track as the return path, needing only one wire and one pole (or pantograph). They are also distinct from other kinds of electric buses, which usually rely on batteries. Power is most commonly supplied as 600-volt direct current in older systems and 750-volts in newer systems, but there are exceptions.\nCurrently, around 300 trolleybus systems are in operation, in cities and towns in 43 countries. Altogether, more than 800 trolleybus systems have existed, but not more than about 400 concurrently.\nHistory.\nThe trolleybus dates back to 29 April 1882, when Dr. Ernst Werner Siemens demonstrated his \"Elektromote\" in a Berlin suburb. This experiment continued until 13 June 1882, after which there were few developments in Europe, although separate experiments were conducted in the United States. In 1899, another vehicle which could run either on or off rails was demonstrated in Berlin. The next development was when Louis Lombard-G\u00e9rin operated an experimental line at the Paris Exhibition of 1900 after four years of trials, with a circular route around Lake Daumesnil that carried passengers. Routes followed in six places including Eberswalde and Fontainebleau. on 10 July 1901 opened the world's fourth passenger-carrying trolleybus system, which operated at Bielatal (Biela Valley, near Dresden), Germany. Schiemann built and operated the Bielatal system, and is credited with developing the under-running trolley current collection system, with two horizontally parallel overhead wires and rigid trolleypoles spring-loaded to hold them up to the wires. Although this system operated only until 1904, Schiemann had developed what is now the standard trolleybus current collection system. In the early days there were many other methods of current collection. The C\u00e9d\u00e8s-Stoll (Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s-\u00c9lectrique-Stoll) system was first operated near Dresden between 1902 and 1904, and 18 systems followed. The Lloyd-K\u00f6hler or Bremen system was tried out in Bremen with 5 further installations, and the Cantono-Frigerio system was used in Italy.\nThroughout this period, trackless freight systems and electric canal boats were also built.\nLeeds and Bradford became the first cities to put trolleybuses into service in Great Britain, on 20 June 1911. Supposedly, though it was opened on 20 June, the public was not admitted to the Bradford route until the 24th. Bradford was also the last city to operate trolleybuses in the UK; the system closed on 26 March 1972. The last rear-entrance trolleybus in service in Britain was also in Bradford and is now owned by the Bradford Trolleybus Association. Birmingham was the first UK city to replace a tram route with trolleybuses, while Wolverhampton, under the direction of Charles Owen Silvers, became world-famous for its trolleybus designs. There were 50 trolleybus systems in the UK, London's being the largest. By the time trolleybuses arrived in Britain in 1911, the Schiemann system was well established and was the most common, although the C\u00e9d\u00e8s-Stoll (Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s-\u00c9lectrique-Stoll) system was tried in West Ham (in 1912) and in Keighley (in 1913).\nSmaller trackless trolley systems were built in the US early as well. The first non-experimental system was a seasonal municipal line installed near Nantasket Beach in 1904; the first year-round commercial line was built to open a hilly property to development just outside Los Angeles in 1910. The trackless trolley was often seen as an interim step, leading to streetcars. In the US, some systems subscribed to the all-four concept of using buses, trolleybuses, streetcars (\"trams, trolleys)\", and rapid transit subway and/or elevated lines (metros), as appropriate, for routes ranging from the lightly used to the heaviest trunk line. Buses and trolleybuses in particular were seen as entry systems that could later be upgraded to rail as appropriate. In a similar fashion, many cities in Britain originally viewed trolleybus routes as extensions to tram (streetcar) routes where the cost of constructing or restoring track could not be justified at the time, though this attitude changed markedly (to viewing them as outright replacements for tram routes) in the years after 1918. Trackless trolleys were the dominant form of new post-World War I electric traction, with extensive systems in among others, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Rhode Island, and Atlanta; San Francisco and Philadelphia still maintain an \"all-four\" fleet.\nSome trolleybus lines in the United States (and in Britain, as noted above) came into existence when a trolley or tram route did not have sufficient ridership to warrant track maintenance or reconstruction. In a similar manner, a proposed tram scheme in Leeds, United Kingdom, was changed to a trolleybus scheme to cut costs.\nTrolleybuses are uncommon today in North America, but their use is widespread in Europe, Asia, South America and in countries which were part of the Soviet Union. Generally trolleybuses occupy a position in usage between street railways (trams) and motorbuses. Worldwide, around 300 cities or metropolitan areas on 5 continents are served by trolleybuses (further detail under Use and preservation, below).\nThis mode of transport operates in large cities, such as Belgrade, Lyon, Pyongyang, S\u00e3o Paulo, Seattle, Sofia, St. Petersburg, and Zurich, as well as in smaller ones such as Dayton, Gdynia, Lausanne, Limoges, Modena, and Salzburg. As of 2020, Kyiv has the largest trolleybus system in the world in terms of route length, while Minsk, has the largest system in terms of number of routes. Sweden's Landskrona has the smallest system in terms of route length, while Czech Republic's Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b is the smallest city to be served by trolleybuses. Opened in 1914, the Shanghai trolleybus system is the oldest currently operating system in the world. With a length of 86\u00a0km, route #52 of Crimean Trolleybus is the longest trolleybus line in the world. \"See also Trolleybus usage by country.\"\nTransit authorities in some cities have reduced or discontinued the use of trolleybuses, while others, wanting to add or expand use of zero-emission vehicles in an urban environment, have opened new systems or are planning new systems. For example, new systems opened in Lecce, Italy, in 2012; in Malatya, Turkey, in 2015; and in Marrakesh in 2017. Beijing and Shanghai have been expanding their respective systems, with Beijing growing to a 31-line system operated with a fleet of over 1,250 trolleybuses. In North Korea, the newest city to have a network is Manpo in December 2019. Since the year 2022, the city of Prague is constructing a new trolleybus system. Meanwhile, in 2023, plans for a trolleybus line in Berlin were scrapped in favour of a solution with battery-powered vehicles (motorbus).\nVehicle design.\nModern-design trolleybuses\nDisadvantages.\nComparison to trams.\n\"Note: As there are numerous variations of tram and light-rail technology, the disadvantages listed may be applicable only with a specific technology or design.\"\nOff-wire power developments.\nWith the re-introduction of hybrid designs, trolleybuses are no longer tied to overhead wires. The Public Service Company of New Jersey, with Yellow Coach, developed \"All Service Vehicles\"; trackless trolleys capable of operating as gas-electric buses when off wire, and used them successfully between 1935 and 1948. Since the 1980s, systems such as Muni in San Francisco, TransLink in Vancouver, and Beijing, among others, have bought trolleybuses equipped with batteries to allow them to operate fairly long distances away from the wires. Supercapacitors can be also used to move buses short distances.\nTrolleybuses can optionally be equipped either with limited off-wire capability\u2014a small diesel engine or battery pack\u2014for auxiliary or emergency use only, or full dual-mode capability. A simple auxiliary power unit can allow a trolleybus to get around a route blockage or can reduce the amount (or complexity) of overhead wiring needed at operating garages (depots). This capability has become increasingly common in newer trolleybuses, particularly in China, North America and Europe, where the vast majority of new trolleybuses delivered since the 1990s are fitted with at least limited off-wire capability. These have gradually replaced older trolleybuses which lacked such capability. In Philadelphia, new trackless trolleys equipped with small hybrid diesel-electric power units for operating short distances off-wire were placed in service by SEPTA in 2008. This is instead of the trolleys using a conventional diesel drive train or battery-only system for their off-wire movement.\nKing County Metro in Seattle, Washington and the MBTA in Boston's Silver Line have used dual-mode buses that run on electric power from overhead wires on a fixed right-of-way and on diesel power on city streets. Metro used special-order articulated Breda buses, introduced in 1990, and most were retired in 2005. A limited number of the Breda dual-mode buses had their diesel engines removed, and operated exclusively as trolleybuses until 2016. Since 2004, the MBTA has used dual-mode buses on its Silver Line (Waterfront) route. The last of these were replaced by diesel hybrid and battery-electric buses in June 2023.\nIn-Motion Charging.\nIMC (In-Motion Charging) trolleybuses are equipped with a light-weight battery, the size of which is adapted to the line profile used. This battery allows them not to depend on overhead lines. They can thus operate with a mix of electric wire and batteries (60% of the time on the wire and 40% on the battery).\nWith the development of battery technology in recent years, trolleybuses with extended off-wire capability through on-board batteries are becoming popular. The on-board battery is charged while the vehicle is in motion under the overhead wires and then allows off-wire travel for significant distances, often in excess of 15\u00a0km. Such trolleybuses are called, among others, trolleybuses with In-Motion Charging, hybrid trolleybuses, battery trolleybuses and electric buses with dynamic charging. The main advantages of this technology over conventional battery electric buses are reduced cost and weight of the battery due to its smaller size, no delays for charging at end stops as the vehicle charges while in motion and reduced need for dedicated charging stations that take up public space. This new development allows the extension of trolleybus routes or the electrification of bus routes without the need to build overhead wires along the whole length of the route. Cities that utilize such trolleybuses include Beijing, Ostrava, Shanghai, Mexico City, Saint Petersburg, and Bergen. The new trolleybus systems in Marrakesh, Baoding and Prague are based exclusively on battery trolleybuses. In 2020, the city of Berlin, Germany announced plans to build a new trolleybus system with 15 routes and 190 battery trolleybuses. However, in early 2023 it was announced that the planned lines would use battery powered electric buses instead.\nIntroducing new flexible, high-capacity public transport of in-motion charging (IMC) trolleybuses are electric buses that can charge dynamically via an overhead contact network and can run on batteries for up to half of their route. Because an IMC bus is operated electrically just as a tramcar without limitation of the range. It concept of trolleybus and ebus with Battery electric bus. IMC500 transfers energy from the infrastructure to the vehicle at a power of up to 500\u00a0kW. The e.g. 2 x 160\u00a0kW motors are supplied in parallel to the battery charging with e.g. 200\u00a0kW.\nErik Lenz from Vossloh Kiepe introduced the term In-Motion Charging (IMC) as a new branding concept in 2014 during the \"trolley:motion\" conference in Hamburg. The purpose of this terminology was to improve the public perception of trolleybuses by highlighting their main advantage: the ability to recharge batteries while in motion, simultaneously carrying passengers.\nThe word \"trolleybus\" originates from 1882, when Werner von Siemens presented an early electrically powered vehicle that collected current from overhead wires through a small, four-wheeled trolley running on them. However, for more than a century, modern trolleybuses have used current collectors without an actual trolley.\nAfter that Erik Lenz contributed as Kiepe Electric the input of the UITP Knowledge Brief \"In-Motion Charging - Innovative Trolleybus\"https:// published in May 2019 followed by \"Infrastructure for In-Motion Charging Trolleybus Systems\" https://.\nOther considerations.\nWith increasing diesel fuel costs and problems caused by particulate matter and NOx emissions in cities, trolleybuses can be an attractive alternative, either as the primary transit mode or as a supplement to rapid transit and commuter rail networks.\nTrolleybuses are quieter than internal combustion engine vehicles. Mainly a benefit, it also provides much less warning of a trolleybus's approach. A speaker attached to the front of the vehicle can raise the noise to a desired \"safe\" level. This noise can be directed to pedestrians in front of the vehicle, as opposed to motor noise which typically comes from the rear of a bus and is more noticeable to bystanders than to pedestrians.\nTrolleybuses can share overhead wires and other electrical infrastructure (such as substations) with tramways. This can result in cost savings when trolleybuses are added to a transport system that already has trams, though this refers only to potential savings over the cost of installing and operating trolleybuses alone.\nThe two parallel wires.\nThe wires are attached to poles next to the street and carefully stretched and mounted so that they are the same width apart and same height over the road (usually about 18 to 20 feet (~5.7m)). The pair of wires is insulated from the poles and provides about 500 to 600 volts to the bus below.\nWire switches.\nTrolleybus wire switches (called \"frogs\" in the UK) are used where a trolleybus line branches into two or where two lines join. A switch may be either in a \"straight through\" or \"turnout\" position; it normally remains in the \"straight through\" position unless it has been triggered, and reverts to it after a few seconds or after the pole shoe passes through and strikes a release lever (in Boston, the resting or \"default\" position is the \"leftmost\" position). Triggering is typically accomplished by a pair of contacts, one on each wire close to and before the switch assembly, which power a pair of electromagnets, one in each frog with diverging wires (\"frog\" generally refers to one fitting that guides one trolley wheel/shoe onto a desired wire or across one wire. Occasionally, \"frog\" has been used to refer to the entire switch assembly).\nMultiple branches may be handled by installing more than one switch assembly. For example, to provide straight-through, left-turn or right-turn branches at an intersection, one switch is installed some distance from the intersection to choose the wires over the left-turn lane, and another switch is mounted closer to or in the intersection to choose between straight through and a right turn (this would be the arrangement in countries such as the United States, where traffic directionality is right-handed; in left-handed traffic countries such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the first switch (before the intersection) would be used to access the right-turn lanes, and the second switch (usually in the intersection) would be for the left-turn).\nThree common types of switches exist: power-on/power-off (the picture of a switch above is of this type), Selectric, and Fahslabend.\nA power-on/power-off switch is triggered if the trolleybus is drawing considerable power from the overhead wires, usually by accelerating, at the moment the poles pass over the contacts (the contacts are lined up on the wires in this case). If the trolleybus \"coasts\" through the switch, the switch will not activate. Some trolleybuses, such as those in Philadelphia and Vancouver, have a manual \"power-coast\" toggle switch that turns the power on or off. This allows a switch to be triggered in situations that would otherwise be impossible, such as activating a switch while braking or accelerating through a switch without activating it. One variation of the toggle switch will simulate accelerating by causing a larger power draw (through a resistance grid), but will not simulate coasting and prevent activation of the switch by cutting the power.\nA Selectric switch has a similar design, but the contacts on the wires are skewed, often at a 45-degree angle, rather than being lined up. This skew means that a trolleybus going straight through will not trigger the switch, but a trolleybus making a turn will have its poles match the contacts in a matching skew (with one pole shoe ahead of the other), which will trigger the switch regardless of power draw (accelerating versus coasting).\nFor a Fahslabend switch, the trolleybus' turn indicator control (or a separate driver-controlled switch) causes a coded radio signal to be sent from a transmitter, often attached to a trolley pole. The receiver is attached to the switch and causes it to trigger if the correct code is received. This has the advantage that the driver does not need to be accelerating the bus (as with a power-on/power-off switch) or trying to make a sharp turn (as with a Selectric switch).\nTrailing switches (where two sets of wires merge) do not require action by the operator. The frog runners are pushed into the desired position by the trolley shoe, or the frog is shaped so the shoe is guided onto the exit wire without any moving parts.\nManufacturing.\nWell over 200 different trolleybus makers have existed \u2013 mostly commercial manufacturers, but in some cases (particularly in communist countries), built by the publicly owned operating companies or authorities. Of the defunct or former trolleybus manufacturers, the largest producers in North America and Western Europe\u00a0\u2013 ones whose production totalled more than 1,000 units each\u00a0\u2013 included the U.S. companies Brill (approx. 3,250 total), Pullman-Standard (2,007), and Marmon-Herrington (1,624); the English companies AEC (approx. 1,750), British United Traction (BUT) (1,573), Leyland (1,420) and Sunbeam (1,379); France's V\u00e9tra (more than 1,750); and the Italian builders Alfa Romeo (2,044) and Fiat (approx. 1,700). The largest former trolleybus manufacture is Trolza (formerly Uritsky, or ZiU) since 1951, until they declared their bankruptcy in 2017, building over 65000 trolleybuses. Also, Canadian Car and Foundry built 1,114 trolleybuses based on designs by Brill.\nAs of the 2010s, at least 30 trolleybus manufacturers exist. They include companies that have been building trolleybuses for several decades, such as \u0160koda since 1936 and New Flyer, among others, along with several younger companies. Current trolleybus manufacturers in western and central Europe include Solaris, Van Hool, and Hess, among others. In Russia ZiU/Trolza has historically been the world's largest trolleybus manufacturer, producing over 65,000 since 1951, mostly for Russia/CIS countries, but after its bankruptcy, its facilities were partially loaned out to PC Transport Systems. \u0160koda is Western and Central Europe's largest and the second largest in the world, having produced over 14,000 trolleybuses since 1936, mostly for export, and it also supplies trolleybus electrical equipment for other bus builders such as Solaris, SOR and Breda. In Mexico, trolleybus production ended when MASA, which had built more than 860 trolleybuses since 1979, was acquired in 1998 by Volvo. However, Dina, which is now that country's largest bus and truck manufacturer, began building trolleybuses in 2013.\nTransition to low-floor designs.\nA significant change to trolleybus designs starting in the early 1990s was the introduction of low-floor models, which began only a few years after the first such models were introduced for motorbuses. These have gradually replaced high-floor designs, and by 2012, every existing trolleybus system in Western Europe had purchased low-floor trolleybuses, with the La Spezia (Italy) system being the last one to do so, and several systems in other parts of the world have purchased low-floor vehicles.\nIn the United States, some transit agencies had already begun to accommodate persons in wheelchairs by purchasing buses with wheelchair lifts, and early examples of fleets of lift-equipped trolleybuses included 109 AM General trolleybuses built for the Seattle trolleybus system in 1979 and the retrofitting of lifts in 1983 to 64 Flyer E800s in the Dayton system's fleet. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required that all new transit vehicles placed into service after 1\u00a0July 1993 be accessible to such passengers.\nTrolleybuses in other countries also began to introduce better access for the disabled in the 1990s, when the first two low-floor trolleybus models were introduced in Europe, both built in 1991, a \"Swisstrolley\" demonstrator built by Switzerland's NAW/Hess and an N6020 demonstrator built by Neoplan. The first production-series low-floor trolleybuses were built in 1992: 13 by NAW for the Geneva system and 10 Gr\u00e4f &amp; Stift for the Innsbruck system. By 1995, such vehicles were also being made by several other European manufacturers, including Skoda, Breda, Ikarus, and Van Hool. The first Solaris \"Trollino\" made its debut in early 2001. In the former Soviet Union countries, Belarus' Belkommunmash built its first low-floor trolleybus (model AKSM-333) in 1999, and other manufacturers in the former Soviet countries joined the trend in the early 2000s.\nHowever, because the lifespan of a trolleybus is typically longer than that of a motorbus, the budget allocation and purchase typically factored in the longevity; the introduction of low-floor vehicles applied pressures on operators to retire high-floor trolleybuses that were only a few years old and replace them with low-floor trolleybuses. Responses varied, with some systems keeping their high-floor fleets, and others retiring them early but, in many instances, selling them second-hand for continued use in countries where there was a demand for low-cost second-hand trolleybuses, in particular in Romania and Bulgaria. The Lausanne system dealt with this dilemma in the 1990s by purchasing new low-floor passenger trailers to be towed by its high-floor trolleybuses, a choice later also made by Lucerne.\nOutside Europe, 14 vehicles built by, and for, the Shanghai trolleybus system in mid-1999 were the first reported low-floor trolleybuses in Southeast Asia. Wellington, New Zealand, took delivery of its first low-floor trolleybus in March 2003, and by the end of 2009 had renewed its entire fleet with such vehicles. Unlike Europe, where low floor means \"100%\" low floor from front to back, most \"low floor\" buses on other continents are actually only low-entry or part-low floor.\nIn the Americas, the first low-floor trolleybus was a Busscar vehicle supplied to the S\u00e3o Paulo EMTU system in 2001. In North America, wheelchair lifts were again chosen for disabled access in new trolleybuses delivered to San Francisco in 1992\u201394, to Dayton in 1996\u20131999, and to Seattle in 2001\u20132002, but the first low-floor trolleybus was built in 2003, with the first of 28 Neoplan vehicles for the Boston system. Subsequently, the Vancouver system and the Philadelphia system have converted entirely to low-floor vehicles, and in 2013 the Seattle and Dayton systems both placed orders for their first low-floor trolleybuses. Outside S\u00e3o Paulo, almost all trolleybuses currently in service in Latin America are high-floor models built before 2000. However, in 2013, the first domestically manufactured low-floor trolleybuses were introduced in both Argentina and Mexico.\nWith regard to non-passenger aspects of vehicle design, the transition from high-floor to low-floor has meant that some equipment previously placed under the floor has been moved to the roof. Some transit operators have needed to modify their maintenance facilities to accommodate this change, a one-time expense.\nDouble-decker trolleybuses.\nSince the end of 1997, no double-decker trolleybuses have been in service anywhere in the world, but, in the past, several manufacturers made such vehicles. Most builders of double-deck trolleybuses were in the United Kingdom, but there were a few, usually solitary, instances of such trolleybuses being built in other countries, including in Germany by Henschel (for Hamburg); in Italy, by Lancia (for Porto, Portugal); in Russia, by the Yaroslavl motor plant (for Moscow) and in Spain, by Maquitrans (for Barcelona). British manufacturers of double-deck trolleybuses included AEC, BUT, Crossley, Guy, Leyland, Karrier, Sunbeam and others.\nIn 2001, Citybus (Hong Kong) converted a Dennis Dragon (#701) into a double-decker trolleybus, and it was tested on a 300-metre track in Wong Chuk Hang in that year. Hong Kong decided not to build a trolleybus system, and the testing of this prototype did not lead to any further production of vehicles.\nUse and preservation.\nThere are currently 300 cities or metropolitan areas where trolleybuses are operated, and more than 500 additional trolleybus systems have existed in the past. For an overview, by country, see Trolleybus usage by country, and for complete lists of trolleybus systems by location, with dates of opening and (where applicable) closure, see List of trolleybus systems and the related lists indexed there.\nOf the systems existing as of 2012, the majority are located in Europe and Asia, including 85 in Russia and 43 in Ukraine. However, there are eight systems existing in North America and nine in South America.\nTrolleybuses have been preserved in most of the countries where they have operated. The United Kingdom has the largest number of preserved trolleybuses with more than 110, while the United States has around 70. Most preserved vehicles are on static display only, but a few museums are equipped with a trolleybus line, allowing trolleybuses to operate for visitors. Museums with operational trolleybus routes include three in the UK \u2013 the Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft, the East Anglia Transport Museum, and the Black Country Living Museum \u2013 and three in the United States \u2013 the Illinois Railway Museum, the Seashore Trolley Museum, and the Shore Line Trolley Museum \u2013 but operation of trolleybuses does not necessarily occur on a regular schedule of dates at these museums.\nSystem of eBRT.\nTrolleybuses are also used in bus rapid transit systems (electrified bus rapid transit, eBRT), the current routes are listed below:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It starred Bill Bixby as stage illusionist Anthony \"Tony\" Blake, a playboy philanthropist who used his skills to solve difficult crimes as needed. In the series pilot, the character was named Anthony Dorian; the name was changed due to a conflict with the name of a real-life stage magician.\nPlot.\nBlake was a professional stage magician who used his skills to solve crimes and help the helpless. Years earlier, Blake had been in prison on a trumped-up espionage charge in an unnamed country in South America. He discovered a way to escape with his cellmate, which began his interest in escapology. The cellmate died and left him a fortune. The escape, apparently followed by exoneration of the false charges that had led to it, led to Blake's pursuit of a career in stage magic, which made him famous. He never forgot his unjust imprisonment, which motivated him to seek justice for others.\nInitially, Blake used a private Boeing jet airliner named \"The Spirit\" as a base of operations; it was outfitted as a mobile residence (\"It's like any other mobile home, only faster\") with live-in pilot Jerry Anderson (Jerry Wallace in the pilot episode, same actor). Blake drove a white '73 Chevrolet Corvette C3 with soft nose, mostly open T-top Targa roof and custom vanity license plates (\"SPIRIT\") and, for its time, an exotic feature\u2014a car phone. Blake frequently received assistance from acerbic columnist Max Pomeroy, and Max's brilliant son Dennis, who uses a wheelchair.\nStarting with episode 6, the opening credits feature a narrator's voice stating, \"All of the magic you're about to see is performed without trick photography of any kind... by Bill Bixby... \"The Magician\"\".\nMidseason changes.\nThe pilot film had shown a four engine jet airplane in gold and brown livery, parked on an apron in daylight, with \"Spirit\" painted as nose art. It was probably the very same Boeing 720 called \"The Starship\" used by touring rock musicians in the 1970s, with gold and brown livery plus band logos from the Led Zeppelin North American Tour in mid 1973 to The Allman Brothers Band in summer of 1974. Then it was painted in US red-white-blue. The TV series showed a twin engine Boeing 737 at night, and in addition, the Corvette entering the plane via a rear loading ramp, a feature only available on some dedicated cargo aircraft, but not on the Boeing 720 or 737 even when converted to freighter.\nMidway through the program's run, the idea of the jet airplane mobile home was dropped and Blake took up residence in a posh apartment at The Magic Castle, a real club devoted to magic acts in Los Angeles, California. At the same time, the supporting cast of the show was replaced with a new, single character, Dominick, a somewhat comical sidekick. No explanation for the changes was given in the series. Jerry continued to make occasional minor appearances, and Tony recruited Jerry and Max together for one further case in the new format.\nCast.\nEpisodes 13\u201321.\nSome episodes feature Larry Anderson, who later created the \"JawDroppers\" video magic course, as Blake's assistant. Todd Crespi also made some appearances as Max's son Dennis.\nProduction.\nMagic on the program.\nBixby, a keen amateur magician, insisted on performing all of the illusions in person, without any trick photography, although it was not possible for this to be the case in the TV-movie/pilot. Many of the episodes of the regular series were preceded by an announcement that the magic tricks were accomplished without trick photography. He was instructed in these performances by the program's technical advisor, Mark Wilson, who was credited as \"magic consultant\". Bixby said, \"I was a catalyst for the magic of Mark [Wilson] and Larry Anderson. They deserve the applause.\" Once the format changed to have the hero based in a magic club, Wilson could occasionally be seen on the stage there, as well. In addition to escapes, Bixby performed feats of sleight of hand, mentalism, and stage illusions. After the series' cancellation, Bixby went on to host a string of magic specials on NBC and a series, \"The Wonderful World of Magic\", in first-run syndication.\nReception.\n\"The Magician\" ranked 47th out of 80 shows during the 1973\u201374 season, with an average 17.6 household rating.\nHome media.\nVisual Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 on August 25, 2017.\nInfluence.\nThough it ran only a single season, \"The Magician\" was an influence on later series. The show was a favorite of \"The X-Files\" creator Chris Carter, who worked it into Special Agent Fox Mulder's \"origin\" story: a teenaged Mulder was waiting to watch \"The Magician\" when his sister Samantha was abducted by mysterious forces.\nIn the \"Quantum Leap\" episode \"The Great Spontini\", Scott Bakula's character, Dr. Sam Beckett, leaps into an amateur magician in 1974 who aspires to appear on Bill Bixby's \"The Magician\"; however, owing to his partial amnesia, Dr. Beckett, at first, can only recall Bixby's connection with \"The Incredible Hulk,\" which had not been made at that time.\n\"The Incredible Hulk\" series featured an episode that paid homage to both \"The Magician\" and Bixby's earlier series, \"My Favorite Martian\". In \"The Incredible Hulk's\" \"My Favorite Magician\" episode, Bixby's character became the temporary apprentice to a stage magician played by Bixby's \"Martian\" co-star, Ray Walston. Mark Wilson was on hand again as the episode's \"magic consultant\" as well. In addition, \"Martian\" co-star Pamela Britton appeared in an episode of \"The Magician\".\nActor Andrew Robinson has stated that his \"\" character, Elim Garak, was partially influenced by Bixby's character.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54419", "revid": "19090310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54419", "title": "Tangram", "text": "Dissection puzzle\nThe tangram () is a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat polygons, called \"tans\", which are put together to form shapes. The objective is to replicate a pattern (given only an outline) generally found in a puzzle book using all seven pieces without overlap. Alternatively the \"tans\" can be used to create original minimalist designs that are either appreciated for their inherent aesthetic merits or as the basis for challenging others to replicate its outline. It is reputed to have been invented in China sometime around the late 18th century and then carried over to America and Europe by trading ships shortly after. It became very popular in Europe for a time, and then again during World War I. It is one of the most widely recognized dissection puzzles in the world and has been used for various purposes including amusement, art, and education.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the English word 'tangram' is unclear. One conjecture holds that it is a compound of the Greek element '-gram' derived from \"\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\" ('written character, letter, that which is drawn') with the 'tan-' element being variously conjectured to be Chinese \"t'an\" 'to extend' or Cantonese \"t'ang\" 'Chinese'. Alternatively, the word may be derivative of the archaic English 'tangram' meaning \"an odd, intricately contrived thing\".\nIn either case, the first known use of the word is believed to be found in the 1848 book \"Geometrical Puzzle for the Young\" by mathematician and future Harvard University president Thomas Hill. Hill likely coined the term in the same work, and vigorously promoted the word in numerous articles advocating for the puzzle's use in education, and in 1864 the word received official recognition in the English language when it was included in Noah Webster's \"American Dictionary\".\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nDespite its relatively recent emergence in the West, there is a much older tradition of dissection amusements in China which likely played a role in its inspiration. In particular, the modular banquet tables of the Song dynasty bear an uncanny resemblance to the playing pieces of the tangram and there were books dedicated to arranging them together to form pleasing patterns.\nSeveral Chinese sources broadly report a well-known Song dynasty polymath Huang Bosi \u9ec4\u4f2f\u601d who developed a form of entertainment for his dinner guests based on creative arrangements of six small tables called \u5bb4\u51e0 or \u71d5\u51e0(\"feast tables\" or \"swallow tables\" respectively). One diagram shows these as oblong rectangles, and other reports suggest a seventh table was added later, perhaps by a later inventor.\nAccording to Western sources, however, the tangram's historical Chinese inventor is unknown except through the pen name Yang-cho-chu-shih (Dim-witted (?) recluse, recluse = \u5904\u58eb). It is believed that the puzzle was originally introduced in a book titled \"Ch'i chi'iao t'u\", which was already reported as lost in 1815 by Shan-chiao in his book \"New Figures of the Tangram\". Nevertheless, it is generally believed that the puzzle was invented about 20 years earlier.\nThe prominent third-century mathematician Liu Hui made use of construction proofs in his works and some bear a striking resemblance to the subsequently developed banquet tables which in turn seem to anticipate the tangram. While there is no reason to suspect that tangrams were used in the proof of the Pythagorean theorem, as is sometimes reported, it is likely that this style of geometric reasoning went on to exert an influence on Chinese cultural life that led directly to the puzzle.\nThe early years of attempting to date the Tangram were confused by the popular but fraudulently written history by famed puzzle maker Samuel Loyd in his 1908 \"The Eighth Book Of Tan\". This work contains many whimsical features that aroused both interest and suspicion amongst contemporary scholars who attempted to verify the account. By 1910 it was clear that it was a hoax. A letter dated from this year from the Oxford Dictionary editor Sir James Murray on behalf of a number of Chinese scholars to the prominent puzzlist Henry Dudeney reads \"The result has been to show that the man Tan, the god Tan, and the Book of Tan are entirely unknown to Chinese literature, history or tradition.\" Along with its many strange details \"The Eighth Book of Tan's\" date of creation for the puzzle of 4000 years in antiquity had to be regarded as entirely baseless and false.\nReaching the Western world (1815\u20131820s).\nThe earliest extant tangram was given to the Philadelphia shipping magnate and congressman Francis Waln in 1802 but it was not until over a decade later that Western audiences, at large, would be exposed to the puzzle. In 1815, American Captain M. Donnaldson was given a pair of author Sang-Hsia-koi's books on the subject (one problem and one solution book) when his ship, \"Trader\", docked there. They were then brought with the ship to Philadelphia in February 1816. The first tangram book to be published in America was based on the pair brought by Donnaldson.\nThe puzzle eventually reached England, where it became very fashionable. The craze quickly spread to other European countries. This was mostly due to a pair of British tangram books, \"The Fashionable Chinese Puzzle\", and the accompanying solution book, \"Key\". Soon, tangram sets were being exported in great number from China, made of various materials, from glass, to wood, to tortoise shell.\nMany of these unusual and exquisite tangram sets made their way to Denmark. Danish interest in tangrams skyrocketed around 1818, when two books on the puzzle were published, to much enthusiasm. The first of these was \"Mandarinen\" (About the Chinese Game). This was written by a student at Copenhagen University, which was a non-fictional work about the history and popularity of tangrams. The second, \"Det nye chinesiske Gaadespil\" (The new Chinese Puzzle Game), consisted of 339 puzzles copied from \"The Eighth Book of Tan\", as well as one original.\nOne contributing factor in the popularity of the game in Europe was that although the Catholic Church forbade many forms of recreation on the sabbath, they made no objection to puzzle games such as the tangram.\nSecond craze in Germany (1891\u20131920s).\nTangrams were first introduced to the German public by industrialist Friedrich Adolf Richter around 1891. The sets were made out of stone or false earthenware, and marketed under the name \"The Anchor Puzzle\".\nMore internationally, the First World War saw a great resurgence of interest in tangrams, on the homefront and trenches of both sides. During this time, it occasionally went under the name of \"The Sphinx\" an alternative title for the \"Anchor Puzzle\" sets.\nParadoxes.\nA tangram paradox is a dissection fallacy: Two figures composed with the same set of pieces, one of which seems to be a proper subset of the other. One famous paradox is that of the two monks, attributed to Henry Dudeney, which consists of two similar shapes, one with and the other missing a foot. In reality, the area of the foot is compensated for in the second figure by a subtly larger body.\nThe two-monks paradox\u00a0\u2013 two similar shapes but one missing a foot:\nThe Magic Dice Cup tangram paradox\u00a0\u2013 from Sam Loyd's book \"The 8th Book of Tan\" (1903). Each of these cups was composed using the same seven geometric shapes. But the first cup is whole, and the others contain vacancies of different sizes. (Notice that the one on the left is slightly shorter than the other two. The one in the middle is ever-so-slightly wider than the one on the right, and the one on the left is narrower still.)\nClipped square tangram paradox\u00a0\u2013 from Loyd's book \"The Eighth Book of Tan\" (1903):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNumber of configurations.\nOver 6500 different tangram problems have been created from 19th-century texts alone, and the current number is ever-growing. Fu Traing Wang and Chuan-Chih Hsiung proved in 1942 that there are only thirteen convex tangram configurations (segments drawn between any two points on the configuration are always completely contained inside the configuration, i.e., configurations with no recesses in the outline).\nPieces.\nChoosing a unit of measurement so that the seven pieces can be assembled to form a square of side one unit and having area one square unit, the seven pieces are:\nOf these seven pieces, the parallelogram is unique in that it has no reflection symmetry but only rotational symmetry, and so its mirror image can be obtained only by flipping it over. Thus, it is the only piece that may need to be flipped when forming certain shapes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In this article he stated that \"\"our ability to devise straightforward and practical chemical syntheses is indispensable to the survival of our species.\" Elsewhere he has said that \"Research is for nations and mankind, not for researchers themselves.\" He encourages scientists to be politically active: \"Researchers must spur public opinions and government policies toward constructing the sustainable society in the 21st century.\"\"\nNoyori is currently a chairman of the Education Rebuilding Council, which was set up by Japan's PM Shinz\u014d Abe after he came to power in 2006.\nNoyori is most famous for asymmetric hydrogenation using as catalysts complexes of rhodium and ruthenium, particularly those based on the BINAP ligand. Asymmetric hydrogenation of an alkene in the presence of ((\"S\")-BINAP)Ru(OAc)2 is used for the commercial production of enantiomerically pure (97% ee) naproxen, a nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drug. The antibacterial agent levofloxacin is manufactured by asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones in the presence of a Ru(II) BINAP halide complex.\nHe has also worked on other asymmetric processes. Each year 3000 tonnes (after new expansion) of menthol are produced (in 94% ee) by Takasago International Corporation, using Noyori's method for isomerisation of allylic amines.\nMore recently with Philip G. Jessop, Noyori has developed an industrial process for the manufacture of \"N,N\"-dimethylformamide from hydrogen, dimethylamine and supercritical carbon dioxide in the presence of as catalyst.\nRecognition.\nThe Ryoji Noyori Prize is named in his honour. In 2000 Noyori became Honorary Doctor at the University of Rennes 1, where he taught in 1995, and in 2005, he became Honorary Doctor at Technical University of Munich and RWTH Aachen University, Germany. Noyori was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2005. and an Honorary Doctorate degree from the Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai (formerly known as UDCT) on the 23rd day of February 2018.\nHe has also been awarded:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As the practice overwhelmingly targets female fetuses, sex-selective abortion often specifically refers to female-selective abortion. Sex-selective abortion is closely linked to female infanticide, and is recognized by many human rights organizations as an act of violence against women. \nThe selective abortion of female fetuses is most common where male children are valued over female children, especially in parts of East Asia and South Asia (particularly in countries such as People's Republic of China, India and Pakistan), as well as in the Caucasus, Western Balkans, and to a lesser extent North America. Based on the third National Family and Health Survey, results showed that if both partners, mother and father, or just the father, preferred male children, sex-selective abortion was more common. In cases where only the mother prefers sons, this is likely to result in sex-selective neglect in which the child is not likely to survive past infancy.\nSex-selective abortion was first documented in 1975, and became commonplace by the late 1980s in South Korea and China and around the same time or slightly later in India.\nSex-selective abortion affects the human sex ratio\u2014the relative number of males to females in a given age group, with China and India, the two most populous countries of the world, having unbalanced gender ratios. Studies and reports focusing on sex-selective abortion are predominantly statistical; they assume that birth-sex ratio\u2014the overall ratio of boys and girls at birth\u2014for a regional population is an indicator of sex-selective abortion. This assumption has been questioned by some scholars. Researchers have shown that in India there are approximately 50,000 to 100,000 female abortions each year, significantly affecting the human sex ratio.\nRecent studies have expanded the understanding of this issue by quantifying trends in conditional sex ratios (CSRs) among Asian diaspora populations in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US, showing that sex selection practices have persisted among diaspora communities from 1999 to 2019. Research into the past four decades of sex-selective abortions in China highlights the significant role these practices have played in shaping the country's demographic profile, despite challenges in estimating exact numbers due to underreporting and the controversial level of sex ratio at birth (SRB).\nAccording to demographic scholarship, the expected birth-sex ratio range is 103 to 107 males to 100 females at birth.\nHuman sex ratio at birth.\nSex-selective abortion affects the human sex ratio\u2014the relative number of males to females in a given age group. Studies and reports that discuss sex-selective abortion are based on the assumption that birth sex ratio\u2014the overall ratio of boys and girls at birth for a regional population, is an indicator of sex-selective abortion.\nThe natural human sex ratio at birth was estimated, in a 2002 study, to be close to 106 boys to 100 girls. Human sex ratio at birth that is significantly different from 106 is often assumed to be correlated to the prevalence and scale of sex-selective abortion. Countries considered to have significant practices of sex-selective abortion are those with birth sex ratios of 108 and above (selective abortion of females), and 102 and below (selective abortion of males). This assumption is controversial, and the subject of continuing scientific studies.\nHigh or low human sex ratio implies sex-selective abortion.\nOne school of scholars suggest that any birth sex ratio of boys to girls that is outside the normal 105\u2013107 range, necessarily implies sex-selective abortion. These scholars claim that both the sex ratio at birth and the population sex ratio are remarkably constant in human populations. Significant deviations in birth sex ratios from the normal range can only be explained by manipulation, that is sex-selective abortion.\nIn a widely cited article, Amartya Sen compared the birth sex ratio in Europe (106) and the United States (105) with those in Asia (107+) and argued that the high sex ratios in East Asia, West Asia and South Asia may be due to excessive female mortality. Sen pointed to research that had shown that if men and women receive similar nutritional and medical attention and good health care then females have better survival rates, and it is the male which is the genetically fragile sex.\nSen estimated 'missing women' from extra women who would have survived in Asia if it had the same ratio of women to men as Europe and the United States. According to Sen, the high birth sex ratio over decades implies a female shortfall of 11% in Asia, or over 100 million women as missing from the 3 billion combined population of South Asia, West Asia, North Africa and China.\nHigh or low human sex ratio may be natural.\nOther scholars question whether birth sex ratio outside 103\u2013107 can be due to natural reasons. William James and others suggest that conventional assumptions have been:\nJames cautions that available scientific evidence stands against the above assumptions and conclusions. He reports that there is an excess of males at birth in almost all human populations, and the natural sex ratio at birth is usually between 102 and 108. However the ratio may deviate significantly from this range for natural reasons such as early marriage and fertility, teenage mothers, average maternal age at birth, paternal age, age gap between father and mother, late births, ethnicity, social and economic stress, warfare, environmental and hormonal effects. This school of scholars support their alternate hypothesis with historical data when modern sex-selection technologies were unavailable, as well as birth sex ratio in sub-regions, and various ethnic groups of developed economies. They suggest that direct abortion data should be collected and studied, instead of drawing conclusions indirectly from human sex ratio at birth.\nJames' hypothesis is supported by historical birth sex ratio data before technologies for ultrasonographic sex-screening were discovered and commercialized in the 1960s and 1970s, as well by reverse abnormal sex ratios currently observed in Africa. Michel Garenne reports that many African nations have, over decades, witnessed birth sex ratios below 100, that is more girls are born than boys. Angola, Botswana and Namibia have reported birth sex ratios between 94 and 99, which is quite different from the presumed 104 to 106 as natural human birth sex ratio.\nJohn Graunt noted that in London over a 35-year period in the 17th century (1628\u201362), the birth sex ratio was 1.07; while Korea's historical records suggest a birth sex ratio of 1.13, based on 5 million births, in 1920s over a 10-year period. Other historical records from Asia too support James' hypothesis. For example, Jiang et al. claim that the birth sex ratio in China was 116\u2013121 over a 100-year period in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; in the 120\u2013123 range in the early 20th century; falling to 112 in the 1930s.\nData on human sex ratio at birth.\nIn the United States, the sex ratios at birth over the period 1970\u20132002 were 105 for the white non-Hispanic population, 104 for Mexican Americans, 103 for African Americans and Native Americans, and 107 for mothers of Chinese or Filipino ethnicity. In the aggregated results of 56 Demographic and Health Surveys in African countries, the birth sex ratio was found to be 103, though there is also considerable country-to-country, and year-to-year variation.\nIn a 2005 study, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported sex ratio at birth in the United States from 1940 over 62 years. This statistical evidence suggested the following: For mothers having their first baby, the total sex ratio at birth was 106 overall, with some years at 107. For mothers having babies after the first, this ratio consistently decreased with each additional baby from 106 towards 103. The age of the mother affected the ratio: the overall ratio was 105 for mothers aged 25 to 35 at the time of birth; while mothers who were below the age of 15 or above 40 had babies with a sex ratio ranging between 94 and 111, and a total sex ratio of 104. This United States study also noted that American mothers of Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese, Cuban and Japanese ethnicity had the highest sex ratio, with years as high as 114 and average sex ratio of 107 over the 62-year study period. Outside of United States, European nations with extensive birth records, such as Finland, report similar variations in birth sex ratios over a 250-year period, that is from 1751 to 1997 AD.\nFemale Selective abortions in Asia are predominantly practiced in areas such as Taiwan, China, and India. The Sex ratio at birth in Asia based on worldwide data is 104 and 107 males per 100 females, which was the accepted norm before sex selective abortion was available. Unfortunately, census results from 2000 are still being reviewed and currently unavailable.\nIn 2017, according to CIA estimates, the countries with the highest birth sex ratio were Liechtenstein (125), Northern Mariana Islands (116), China (114), Armenia (112), Falkland Islands (112), India (112), Grenada (110), Hong Kong (110), Vietnam (110), Albania (109), Azerbaijan (109), San Marino (109), Isle of Man (108), Kosovo (108) and Macedonia (108). Also in 2017 the lowest ratio (i.e. more girls born) was in Nauru at 83. There were ratios of 102 and below in several countries, most of them African countries or Black/African majority population Caribbean countries: Angola, Aruba, Barbados, Bermuda, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Cayman Islands, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Republic of the Congo, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kazakhstan, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Togo, Uganda, Zambia.\nThere is controversy about the notion of the exact natural sex ratio at birth. In a study around 2002, the natural sex ratio at birth was estimated to be close to 1.06 males/female. There is controversy whether sex ratios outside the 103-107 range are due to sex-selection, as suggested by some scholars, or due to natural causes. The claims that unbalanced sex ratios are necessary due to sex selection have been questioned by some researchers. Some researchers argue that an unbalanced sex ratio should not be automatically held as evidence of prenatal sex-selection; Michel Garenne reports that many African nations have, over decades, witnessed birth sex ratios below 100, that is more girls are born than boys. Angola, Botswana and Namibia have reported birth sex ratios between 94 and 99, which is quite different than the presumed \"normal\" sex ratio, meaning that significantly more girls have been born in such societies.\nIn addition, in many developing countries there are problems with birth registration and data collection, which can complicate the issue. With regard to the prevalence of sex selection, the media and international attention has focused mainly on a few countries, such as China, India and the Caucasus, ignoring other countries with a significant sex imbalance at birth. For example, Liechtenstein's sex ratio is far worse than that of those countries, but little has been discussed about it, and virtually no suggestions have been made that it may practice sex selection, although it is a very conservative country where women could not vote until 1984. At the same time, there have been accusations that the situation in some countries, such as Georgia, has been exaggerated. In 2017, Georgia' sex ratio at birth was 107, according to CIA statistics.\nData reliability.\nThe estimates for birth sex ratios, and thus derived sex-selective abortion, are a subject of dispute as well. For example, United States' CIA projects the birth sex ratio for Switzerland to be 106, while the Switzerland's Federal Statistical Office that tracks actual live births of boys and girls every year, reports the latest birth sex ratio for Switzerland as 107. Other variations are more significant; for example, CIA projects the birth sex ratio for Pakistan to be 105, United Nations FPA office claims the birth sex ratio for Pakistan to be 110, while the government of Pakistan claims its average birth sex ratio is 111.\nThe two most studied nations with high sex ratio and sex-selective abortion are China and India. The CIA estimates a birth sex ratio of 112 for both in recent years. However, The World Bank claims the birth sex ratio for China in 2009 was 120 boys for every 100 girls; while United Nations FPA estimates China's 2011 birth sex ratio to be 118.\nFor India, the United Nations FPA claims a birth sex ratio of 111 over 2008\u201310 period, while The World Bank and India's official 2011 Census reports a birth sex ratio of 108. These variations and data reliability is important as a rise from 108 to 109 for India, or 117 to 118 for China, each with large populations, represent a possible sex-selective abortion of about 100,000 girls.\nBias is due to the unreported births in hospitals which makes a slight difference on the data they report vs the census. If parents obtain sex testing before birth, and abortion was made and it was based on female fetus, it is more likely for the abortion to happen in the hospital for safety purposes and would have been reported. With no comparative data with hospitals vs nonhospital births the length of biased would be unable to determine opposed to those countries where most hospital births occur and are actually reported.\nPrenatal sex discernment.\nThe earliest post-implantation test, cell free fetal DNA testing, involves taking a blood sample from the mother and isolating the small amount of fetal DNA that can be found within it. When performed after week seven of pregnancy, this method is about 98% accurate.\nObstetric ultrasonography, either transvaginally or transabdominally, checks for various markers of fetal sex. It can be performed at or after week 12 of pregnancy. At this point, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 of fetal sexes can be correctly determined, according to a 2001 study. Accuracy for males is approximately 50% and for females almost 100%. When performed after week 13 of pregnancy, ultrasonography gives an accurate result in almost 100% of cases.\nThe most invasive measures are chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis, which involve testing of the chorionic villus (found in the placenta) and amniotic fluid, respectively. Both techniques typically test for chromosomal disorders but can also reveal the sex of the child and are performed early in the pregnancy. However, they are often more expensive and more dangerous than blood sampling or ultrasonography, so they are seen less frequently than other sex determination techniques.\nPrenatal sex determination is restricted in many countries, and so is the communication of the sex of the fetus to the pregnant woman or her family, in order to prevent sex selective abortion.\nIn India, prenatal sex determination is regulated under the Pre-conception and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act 1994.\nChina launched its first ultrasonography machine in 1979. Chinese health care clinics began introducing ultrasound technologies that could be used to determine prenatal sex in 1982. By 1991, Chinese companies were producing 5,000 ultrasonography machines per year. Almost every rural and urban hospital and family planning clinics in China had a good quality sex discernment equipment by 2001.\nThe launch of ultrasonography technology in India too occurred in 1979, but its expansion was slower than China. Ultrasound sex discernment technologies were first introduced in major cities of India in the 1980s, its use expanded in India's urban regions in the 1990s, and became widespread in the 2000s.\nAfrica and the Middle East.\nSex selective abortion based on son preference is significant in North Africa and the Middle East.\nAsia.\nThe total numbers of \"missing women\" are about 11.9 million and 10.6 million in China and India respectively, out of 23 million world-wide, according to a 2019 study. Given that the total number of recorded abortions is much lower than that, some dispute those numbers.\nChina.\nChina, the most populous country in the world, has a serious problem with an unbalanced sex ratio population. A 2010 BBC article stated that the sex birth ratio was 119 boys born per 100 girls, which rose to 130 boys per 100 girls in some rural areas. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimated that more than 24 million Chinese men of marrying age could find themselves without spouses by 2020. In 1979, China enacted the one-child policy, which, within the country's deeply patriarchal culture, resulted in an unbalanced birth sex ratio. The one child policy was enforced throughout the years, including through forced abortions and forced sterilizations, but gradually loosened until it was formally abolished in 2015.\nWhen sex ratio began being studied in China in 1960, it was still within the normal range. However, it climbed to 111.9 by 1990 and to 118 by 2010 per its official census. Researchers believe that the causes of this sex ratio imbalance are increased female infant mortality, underreporting of female births and sex-selective abortion. According to Zeng et al. (1993), the most prominent cause is probably sex-selective abortion, but this is difficult to prove that in a country with little reliable birth data because of the hiding of \"illegal\" (under the One-Child Policy) births.\nThese illegal births have led to underreporting of female infants. Zeng et al., using a reverse survival method, estimate that underreporting keeps about 2.26% male births and 5.94% female births off the books. Adjusting for unreported illegal births, they conclude that the corrected Chinese sex ratio at birth for 1989 was 111 rather than 115. These national averages over time, mask the regional sex ratio data. For example, in 2005 Anhui, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Hunan and Guangdong, had a sex ratio at birth of more than 130.\nTraditional Chinese techniques have been used to determine sex for hundreds of years, primarily with unknown accuracy. It was not until ultrasonography became widely available in urban and rural China that sex was able to be determined scientifically. In 1986, the Ministry of Health posted the Notice on Forbidding Prenatal Sex Determination, but it was not widely followed. Three years later, the Ministry of Health outlawed the use of sex determination techniques, except for in diagnosing hereditary diseases. Individuals or clinics that violated the ban on prenatal determination at the request of the mother were subject to financial penalties, and the ban was repeatedly affirmed in the 1980s, early 1990s, and early 2000s. However, many people have personal connections to medical practitioners and strong son preference still dominates culture, leading to the widespread use of sex determination techniques.\nHardy, Gu, and Xie suggest sex-selective abortion is more prevalent in rural China because son preference is much stronger there. Urban areas of China, on average, are moving toward greater equality for both sexes, while rural China tends to follow more traditional views of gender. This is partially due to the belief that, while sons are always part of the family, daughters are only temporary, going to a new family when they marry. Additionally, if a woman's firstborn child is a son, her position in society moves up, while the same is not true of a firstborn daughter. Families in China are aware of the critical lack of female children and its implication on marriage prospects in the future; many parents are beginning to work extra when their sons are young so that they will be able to pay for a bride for them.\nIn a 2005 study, Zhu, Lu, and Hesketh found that the highest sex ratio was for those ages 1\u20134, and two provinces, Tibet and Xinjiang, had sex ratios within normal limits. Two other provinces had a ratio over 140, four had ratios between 130 and 139, and seven had ratios between 120 and 129, each of which is significantly higher than the natural sex ratio.\nThe birth sex ratio in China, according to a 2012 news report, has decreased to 117 males born for every 100 females. The sex ratio peaked in 2004 at around 121, and had declined to around 112 in 2017. The ratio was forecast to drop below 112 by 2020 and 107 by 2030, according to the National Population Development Outline by the State Council.\nIn December 2016, researchers at the University of Kansas reported that the missing women might be largely a result of administrative under-reporting and that delayed registration of females, instead of abortion and infanticide practices. The finding questioned the earlier assumptions that rural Chinese villagers aborted their daughters on a massive scale and concluded that as many as 10 to 15 million missing women hadn't received proper birth registration since 1982. The reason for underreporting was attributed to families trying to avoid penalties when girls were born, and local government concealing the lack of enforcement from the central government. This implied that the sex disparity of the Chinese newborns was likely exaggerated significantly in previous analyses. Though the degree of data discrepancy, the challenge in relation to sex-ratio imbalance in China is still disputed among scholars.\nIndia.\nA research by Pew Research Center based on Union government data indicates foeticide of at least 9 million females in the years 2000\u20132019. The research found that 86.7% of these foeticides were by Hindus (80% of the population), followed by Sikhs (1.7% of the population) with 4.9%, and Muslims (14% of the population) with 6.6%. The research also indicated an overall decline in preference for sons in the time period.\nIndia's 2001 census revealed a national 0\u20136 age child sex ratio of 108, which increased to 109 according to 2011 census (927 girls per 1000 boys and 919 girls per 1000 boys respectively, compared to expected normal ratio of 943 girls per 1000 boys). The national average masks the variations in regional numbers according to 2011 census\u2014Haryana's ratio was 120, Punjab's ratio was 118, Jammu &amp; Kashmir was 116, and Gujarat's ratio was 111. The 2011 Census found eastern states of India had birth sex ratios between 103 and 104, lower than normal. In contrast to decadal nationwide census data, small non-random sample surveys report higher child sex ratios in India.\nThe child sex ratio in India shows a regional pattern. India's 2011 census found that all eastern and southern states of India had a child sex ratio between 103 and 107, typically considered as the \"natural ratio.\" The highest sex ratios were observed in India's northern and northwestern states \u2013 Haryana (120), Punjab (118) and Jammu &amp; Kashmir (116). The western states of Maharashtra and Rajasthan 2011 census found a child sex ratio of 113, Gujarat at 112 and Uttar Pradesh at 111.\nThe Indian census data suggests there is a positive correlation between abnormal sex ratio and better socio-economic status and literacy. Urban India has higher child sex ratio than rural India according to 1991, 2001 and 2011 Census data, implying higher prevalence of sex selective abortion in urban India. Similarly, child sex ratio greater than 115 boys per 100 girls is found in regions where the predominant majority is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian; furthermore \"normal\" child sex ratio of 104 to 106 boys per 100 girls are also found in regions where the predominant majority is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian. These data contradict any hypotheses that may suggest that sex selection is an archaic practice which takes place among uneducated, poor sections or particular religion of the Indian society.\nRutherford and Roy, in their 2003 paper, suggest that techniques for determining sex prenatally that were pioneered in the 1970s, gained popularity in India. These techniques, claim Rutherford and Roy, became broadly available in 17 of 29 Indian states by the early 2000s. Such prenatal sex determination techniques, claim Sudha and Rajan in a 1999 report, where available, favored male births.\nArnold, Kishor, and Roy, in their 2002 paper, too hypothesize that modern fetal sex screening techniques have skewed child sex ratios in India. Ganatra et al., in their 2000 paper, use a small survey sample to estimate that &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20446 of reported abortions followed a sex determination test.\nThe Indian government and various advocacy groups have continued the debate and discussion about ways to prevent sex selection. The immorality of prenatal sex selection has been questioned, with some arguments in favor of prenatal discrimination as more humane than postnatal discrimination by a family that does not want a female child. Others question whether the morality of sex selective abortion is any different over morality of abortion when there is no risk to the mother nor to the fetus, and abortion is used as a means to end an unwanted pregnancy.\nIndia passed its first abortion-related law, the so-called Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971, making abortion legal in most states, but specified legally acceptable reasons for abortion such as medical risk to mother and rape. The law also established physicians who can legally provide the procedure and the facilities where abortions can be performed, but did not anticipate sex selective abortion based on technology advances.\nWith increasing availability of sex screening technologies in India through the 1980s in urban India, and claims of its misuse, the Government of India passed the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PNDT) in 1994. This law was further amended into the Pre-Conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) (PCPNDT) Act in 2004 to deter and punish prenatal sex screening and sex selective abortion. The impact of the law and its enforcement is unclear. However, research shows that there was about a 0.7%-1% increase in female births after the PNDT Act was passed in 1994. Unfortunately, this data was not significant. United Nations Population Fund and India's National Human Rights Commission, in 2009, asked the Government of India to assess the impact of the law. The Public Health Foundation of India, an activist NGO in its 2010 report, claimed a lack of awareness about the Act in parts of India, inactive role of the Appropriate Authorities, ambiguity among some clinics that offer prenatal care services, and the role of a few medical practitioners in disregarding the law. At the start of passing this act, women were still able to travel across borders to continue having sex-selective abortions. This was until the national PNDT was passed in 1996.\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has targeted education and media advertisements to reach clinics and medical professionals to increase awareness. The Indian Medical Association has undertaken efforts to prevent prenatal sex selection by giving its members \"Beti Bachao\" (save the daughter) badges during its meetings and conferences.\nIn November 2007, MacPherson estimated that 100,000 abortions every year continue to be performed in India solely because the fetus is female. Women may further be subject to violence for birthing daughters over sons. In 2016, Anu Bansal was murdered by her husband after giving birth to another daughter. She was burned to death.\nPakistan.\nFor Pakistan, the United Nations Population Fund, in its 2012 report estimates the Pakistan birth sex ratio to be 110. In the urban regions, particularly its densely populated region of Punjab, report a sex ratio above 112 (less than 900 females per 1000 males). Hudson and Den Boer estimate the resulting deficit to be about 6 million missing girls in Pakistan than what would normally be expected. \nIn 2017, two Pakistani organisations discovered large cases of infanticide in Pakistani cities. This was led by the Edhi Foundation and Chhipa Welfare Foundation. The infanticide victims were almost all were female infants. The reason given by the local authorities were poverty and local customs, where boys are preferred to girls. However, the large discovery in Karachi shows that many of the female infants were killed because of the local clerics, who ordered that out-of-wedlock babies should be disregarded. This is due to the fact that fornication is a major sin in Islam, although it is also \"haram\" (forbidden) to kill an innocent soul, which babies and children fall under. In fact, Muhammad explicitly banned the killing of female infants, as it was a custom in Pre-Islamic Arabia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSouth Korea.\nSex-selective abortion gained popularity in the mid-1980s to early 1990s in South Korea, where selective female abortions were commonplace as male children were preferred. Historically, much of Korea's values and traditions were based on Confucianism that dictated the patriarchal system, motivating the heavy preference for sons. Additionally, even though the abortion ban existed, the combination of son preference and availability of sex-selective technology led to an increasing number of sex-selective abortions and boys born. As a result, South Korea experienced drastically high sex ratios around mid-1980s to early 1990s. However, in recent years, with the changes in family policies and modernization, attitudes towards son preference have changed, normalizing the sex ratio and lowering the number of sex-selective abortions. With that being said, there has been no explicit data on the number of induced sex selective abortions reportedly performed due to the abortion ban and controversy surrounding the topic. Therefore, scholars have been continuously analyzing and generating connections among sex-selection, abortion policies, gender discrimination, and other cultural factors.\nOther Asian countries.\nOther countries with large populations but high sex ratios include Vietnam. The United Nations Population Fund, in its 2012 report, claims the birth sex ratio of Vietnam at 111 with its densely populated Red River Delta region at 116.\nTaiwan has reported a sex ratio at birth between 1.07 and 1.11 every year, across 4 million births, over the 20-year period from 1991 to 2011, with the highest birth sex ratios in the 2000s. Sex-selective abortion is reported to be common in South Korea too, but its incidence has declined in recent years. As of 2015, South Korea's sex ratio at birth was 1.07 male/female. In 2015, Hong Kong had a sex ratio at birth of 1.12 male/female. A 2001 study on births in the late 1990s concluded that \"sex selection or sex-selective abortion might be practiced among Hong Kong Chinese women\".\nRecently, a rise in the sex ratio at birth has been noted in some parts of Nepal, most notably in the Kathmandu Valley, but also in districts such as Kaski. High sex ratios at birth are most notable amongst richer, more educated sections of the population in urban areas.\nEurope.\nAbnormal sex ratios at birth, possibly explained by growing incidence of sex-selective abortion, have also been noted in some other countries outside South and East Asia. According to CIA, the most imbalanced birth sex ratios in Europe (2017) are in Liechtenstein, Armenia, Albania, Azerbaijan, San Marino, Kosovo and North Macedonia; with Liechtenstein having the most imbalanced sex ratio in the world.\nCaucasus.\nThe Caucasus has been named a \"male-dominated region\", and as families have become smaller in recent years, the pressures to have sons has increased. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the birth sex ratio in Caucasus countries such as Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia was in the 105 to 108 range. After the collapse, the birth sex ratios sharply climbed and have remained high for the last 20 years. Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan have seen strongly imbalanced birth sex ratios in the first decade of the 21st century. In Georgia, the birth sex ratio for the years 2005\u20132009 was cited by \"The Economist\" to be about 120, a trend \"The Economist\" claims suggests that the practice of sex-selective abortion in the Caucasus has been similar to those in East Asia and South Asia in recent decades.\nAccording to an article in \"The Economist\" the sex ratio in Armenia is seen to be a function of birth order. The article claimed that among first born children, there are 138 boys for every 100 girls. Overall, the birth sex ratio in Armenia exceeded 115 in some years, far higher than India's which was cited at 108. While these high birth sex ratios suggest sex-selective abortion, there is no direct evidence of observed large-scale sex-selective abortions in Caucasus.\nAccording to latest CIA data, the 2017 sex ratio in the region is 112 for Armenia, 109 for Azerbaijan, and 107 for Georgia.\nSoutheast Europe.\nAn imbalanced birth sex ratio has been present in the 21st century in the Western Balkans, in countries such as Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo and Montenegro. Scholars claim this suggests that sex-selective abortions are common in southeast Europe. As of 2017, according to CIA estimates, Albania's birth sex ratio is 109. According to Eurostat and birth record data over 2008\u201311, the birth sex ratios of Albania and Montenegro for that period were 112 and 110 respectively. In recent years, Montenegrin health authorities have expressed concern with regard to the significant imbalance between the number of male and female births. However the data from CIA in 2017 cites the birth ratio for Montenegro within the normal range, at 106. In recent years, the birth registration data for Macedonia and Kosovo indicate unbalanced birth sex ratios, including a birth rate in 2010 of 112 for Kosovo As 2017, CIA cited both Macedonia and Kosovo at 108.\nAmericas.\nUnited States.\nAs in other countries, sex-selective abortion is difficult to track in the United States because of lack of data.\nWhile the vast majority of parents in the United States do not practice sex-selective abortion, there is certainly a trend toward male preference. According to a 2011 Gallup poll, if they were only allowed to have one child, 40% of respondents said they would prefer a boy, while only 28% preferred a girl. When told about prenatal sex selection techniques such as sperm sorting and in-vitro-fertilization embryo selection, 40% of Americans surveyed thought that picking embryos by sex was an acceptable manifestation of reproductive rights. These selection techniques are available at about half of American fertility clinics, as of 2006. However, other studies show a larger preference for females. According to the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, 80% of American couples who wanted to get gender selection wanted girls over boys.\nA study of the 2000 United States Census suggests possible male bias in families of Chinese, Korean and Indian immigrants, which was getting increasingly stronger in families where the first one or two children were female. In those families where the first two children were girls, the birth-sex ratio of the third child was 1.51:1.\nBecause of this movement toward sex preference and selection, many bans on sex-selective abortion have been proposed at the state and federal level. In 2010 and 2011, sex-selective abortions were banned in Oklahoma and Arizona, respectively. Legislators in Georgia, West Virginia, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York have also tried to pass acts banning the procedure.\nOther countries.\nA 2013 study by John Bongaarts based on surveys in 61 major countries calculates the sex ratios that would result if parents had the number of daughters and sons they want. In 35 countries, claims Bongaarts, the desired birth sex ratio in respective countries would be more than 110 boys for every 100 girls if parents in these countries had a child matching their preferred gender (higher than India's, which The Economist claims is 108).\nEstimates of missing women.\nEstimates of implied missing girls, considering the \"normal\" birth sex ratio to be the 103\u2013107 range, vary considerably between researchers and underlying assumptions for expected post-birth mortality rates for men and women. For example, a 2005 study estimated that over 90 million females were \"missing\" from the expected population in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan, South Korea and Taiwan alone, and suggested that sex-selective abortion plays a role in this deficit. For early 1990s, Sen estimated 107 million missing women, Coale estimated 60 million as missing, while Klasen estimated 89 million missing women in China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, West Asia and Egypt. Guilmoto, in his 2010 report, uses recent data (except for Pakistan), and estimates a much lower number of missing girls, but notes that the higher sex ratios in numerous countries have created a gender gap \u2013 shortage of girls \u2013 in the 0\u201319 age group.\nDisparate gendered access to resources.\nAlthough there is significant evidence of the prevalence of sex-selective abortions in many nations (especially India and China), there is also evidence to suggest that some of the variation in global sex ratios is due to disparate access to resources. As MacPherson (2007) notes, there can be significant differences in gender violence and access to food, healthcare, immunizations between male and female children. This leads to high infant and childhood mortality among girls, which causes changes in sex ratio.\nDisparate, gendered access to resources appears to be strongly linked to socioeconomic status. Specifically, poorer families are sometimes forced to ration food, with daughters typically receiving less priority than sons. However, Klasen's 2001 study revealed that this practice is less common in the poorest families, but rises dramatically in the slightly less poor families. Klasen and Wink's 2003 study suggests that this is \"related to greater female economic independence and fewer cultural strictures among the poorest sections of the population\". In other words, the poorest families are typically less bound by cultural expectations and norms, and women tend to have more freedom to become family breadwinners out of necessity.\nIncreased sex ratios can be caused by disparities in aspects of life other than vital resources. According to Sen (1990), differences in wages and job advancement also have a dramatic effect on sex ratios. This is why high sex ratios are sometimes seen in nations with little sex-selective abortion. Additionally, high female education rates are correlated with lower sex ratios (World Bank 2011).\nLopez and Ruzikah (1983) found that, when given the same resources, women tend to outlive men at all stages of life after infancy. However, globally, resources are not always allocated equitably. Thus, some scholars argue that disparities in access to resources such as healthcare, education, and nutrition play at least a small role in the high sex ratios seen in some parts of the world. For example, Alderman and Gerter (1997) found that unequal access to healthcare is a primary cause of female death in developing nations, especially in Southeast Asia. Moreover, in India, lack of equal access to healthcare has led to increased disease and higher rates of female mortality in every age group until the late thirties (Sen 1990). This is particularly noteworthy because, in regions of the world where women receive equal resources, women tend to outlive men (Sen 1990). Women outlive men in all but 2 countries.\nEconomic disadvantage alone may not always lead to increased sex ratio, claimed Sen in 1990. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most economically disadvantaged regions of the world, there is an excess of women. So, if economic disadvantage is uncorrelated with sex ratio in Africa, some other factor(s) may be at play. More detailed analysis of African demographics, in 2002, suggests that Africa too has wide variation in birth sex ratios (from 1.01 in Bantu populations of East Africa to 1.08 in Nigeria and Ethiopia). Thus economic disadvantage remains a possible unresolved hypothesis for Africa as well.\nReasons for sex-selective abortion.\nAccording to the 2012 report of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities on sex imbalances at birth, there are three preconditions for sex-selective abortion. First, the practice should be feasible with the availability of abortion methods and prenatal sex-screening technologies (e.g., obstetric ultrasonography, cell-free fetal DNA, amniocentesis). Second, changing the sex composition of children should be advantageous to the parents and the family. A variety of socioeconomic factors can account for this sex preference such as inherence rules, patronymic transmission, dowry systems, social preference of family composition. Third, sex-selective abortion should be necessary because of low or decreasing fertility. Given the existence of the social benefits associated with sons, the need for having sons while maintaining a limited number of children is intensified by low fertility. Low fertility can be a result of social norms of family size, rising marginal costs of an additional child, or birth control policies.\nSome demographers question whether sex-selective abortion or infanticide claims are accurate, because underreporting of female births may also explain high sex ratios. Natural reasons may also explain some of the abnormal sex ratios. In contrast to these possible causes of abnormal sex ratio, Klasen and Wink suggest India and China's high sex ratios are primarily the result of sex-selective abortion.\nSocioeconomic reasons for son preference and daughter aversion.\nCultural preference.\nThe reason for intensifying sex-selection abortion in China and India can be seen through history and cultural background. Generally, before the information era, male babies were preferred because they provided manual labor and continuation of the family lineage. Labor is still important in developing nations as China and India, but when it comes to family lineage, it is of great importance.\nThe selective abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where cultural norms value male children over female children for a variety of social and economic reasons. A son is often preferred as an \"asset\" since he can earn and support the family; a daughter is a \"liability\" since she will be married off to another family, and so will not contribute financially to her parents. Sex selective female abortion is a continuation, in a different form, of a practice of female infanticide or withholding of postnatal health care for girls in certain households. Furthermore, in some cultures sons are expected to take care of their parents in their old age. These factors are complicated by the effect of diseases on child sex ratio, where communicable and noncommunicable diseases affect males and females differently. In parts of India and Pakistan, there are social norms such as purdah, which stipulate that female seclusion and confinement to the home is necessary. Such practices are prevalent among some Muslim and Hindu communities in South Asia. When females interact with men, or are believed to do so, the \"family honor\" is tarnished.\nHistorically, in many South Asian populations, women were allocated a very low status, evidenced through practices such as sati, an ancient funeral custom where a widow immolated herself on her husband's pyre or committed suicide in another fashion shortly after her husband's death. Such societies, in placing almost no value on females, encouraged parents to commit infanticide of girls or to abandon them. The modern practice of sex-selective abortion is therefore a continuation of other historical practices. During the 19th century, in the Northwest British India, one-fourth of the population preserved only half the daughters, while other 3/4th of the population had balanced sex ratio. There were 118 males per 100 females. This is comparable to the contemporary sex ratio in the area, now divided between India and Pakistan.\nChinese culture is deeply patriarchal. Pre-modern Chinese society was predominantly patriarchal and patrilineal from at least the 11th century BC onwards. There has long been a son preference in China, leading to high rates of female infanticide, as well as a strong tradition of restricting the freedom of movement of women, particularly upper-class women, manifested through the practice of foot binding. Although the legal and social standing of women have greatly improved in the 20th century, son preference remains still strong, and the situation was aggravated by the one child policy.\nInterpretations of Confucianism have been argued to contribute to the low status of women. The gender roles prescribed in the Three Obediences and Four Virtues became a cornerstone of the family, and thus, societal stability. Starting from the Han period, Confucians began to teach that a virtuous woman was supposed to follow the males in her family: the father before her marriage, the husband after she marries, and her sons in widowhood. In the later dynasties, more emphasis was placed on the virtue of chastity. The Song dynasty Confucian Cheng Yi stated that: \"To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter.\" The \"cult of chastity\" accordingly, condemned many widows to poverty and loneliness by placing a social stigma on remarriage.\nIn modern East Asia, a large part of the pattern of preferences leading to this practice can be condensed simply as a desire to have a male heir. Monica Das Gupta (2005) observes, from 1989 birth data for China, there was no evidence of selective abortion of female fetuses among firstborn children. However, there was a strong preference for a boy if the first born was a girl.\nDowry.\nDowry is the property that parents of a female transfer at her marriage. Dowry is an ancient practice, that has been common in many cultures around the world, and which is today prevalent especially in South Asia. The custom of dowry is most common in cultures that are strongly patrilineal and that expect women to reside with or near their husband's family (patrilocality).\nKirti Singh states that dowry is widely considered to be both a cause and a consequence of son preference, and this may lead to girls being unwanted, sex selective abortion, female infanticide or abuse of female children.\nThe dowry system in India is a major part of Indian culture and refers to the durable goods, cash, and real or movable property that the bride's family gives to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage. Dowry consists of a payment in cash or some kind of gifts given to the bridegroom's family along with the bride and includes cash, jewelry, electrical appliances, furniture, bedding, crockery, utensils and other household items that help the newlyweds set up their home. Disputes regarding dowry sometimes lead to dowry deaths.\nTrivers\u2013Willard hypothesis.\nThe Trivers\u2013Willard hypothesis argues that resource availability affects male reproductive success more than female and that, consequently, parents should prefer males when resources are plentiful and females when resources are scarce. This has been applied to resource differences between individuals in a society and also to resource differences between societies. Empirical evidence is mixed, with higher support in better studies, according to Cronk in a 2007 review. One example: in a 1997 study of a group with a preference for females was Romani in Hungary, a low-status group. They \"had a female-biased sex ratio at birth, were more likely to abort a fetus after having had one or more daughters, nursed their daughters longer, and sent their daughters to school for longer.\"\nOne-child policy.\nFollowing the 1949 creation of the People's Republic of China, the issue of population control came into the national spotlight. In the early years of the Republic, leaders believed that telling citizens to reduce their fertility was enough, repealing laws banning contraception and instead promoting its use. However, the contraceptives were not widely available, both because of lack of supply and because of cultural taboo against discussing sex. Efforts were slowed following the famine of 1959\u201361 but were resumed shortly thereafter with virtually the same results. Then, in 1964, the Family Planning Office was established to enforce stricter guidelines regarding fertility and it was moderately successful.\nIn 1979, the government adopted the One-Child Policy, which limited many families to one child, unless specified by provincial regulations. It was instituted as an attempt to boost the Chinese economy. Under it, families who break rules regarding the number of children they are allowed are given various punishments (primarily monetary), dependent upon the province in which they live.\nAs stated above, the sex ratios of a province are largely determined by the type of restriction placed upon the family, pointing to the conclusion that much of the imbalance in sex ratio in China can be attributed to the policy. Research by Junhong (2001) found that many parents are willing to pay to ensure that their child is male (especially if their first child is female), but will not do the same to ensure their child is female. Likely, fear of the harsh monetary punishments of the One-Child Policy make ensuring a son's birth a smart investment. Therefore, son's cultural and economic importance to families and the large expenses associated with multiple children are primary factors leading to China's disparate sex ratio.\nIn 2013, China announced plans to formally change the One-Child policy, making it less stringent. The National People's Congress has changed the policy to allow couples to have two children, so long as one of the partners is an only child. This change was not sparked by sex ratios, but rather by an aging population that is causing the workforce to become increasingly smaller. It is estimated that this new law will lead to two million more births per year and could cause a baby boom in China. In 2015, China officially relaxed its one child law. Unfortunately, many of China's social problems are based on overpopulation. So, it is unclear if this new law will actually lead to women being more valued in Chinese society as the number of citizens increases.\nSocietal effects.\nMissing women.\nThe idea of \"missing women\" was first suggested by Amartya Sen, one of the first scholars to study high sex ratios and their causes globally, in 1990. In order to illustrate the gravity of the situation, he calculated the number of women that were not alive because of sex-selective abortion or discriminatory practices. He found that there were 11 percent fewer women than there \"should\" have been, if China had the natural sex ratio. This figure, when combined with statistics from around the world, led to a finding of over 100 million missing women. In other words, by the early 1990s, the number of missing women was \"larger than the combined casualties of all famines in the twentieth century\" (Sen 1990).\nThis has led to particular concern due to a critical shortage of wives. In some rural areas, there is already a shortage of women, which is tied to migration into urban areas (Park and Cho 1995). In South Korea and Taiwan, high male sex ratios and declining birth rates over several decades have led to cross-cultural marriage between local men and foreign women from countries such as mainland China, Vietnam and the Philippines. However, sex-selective abortion is not the only cause of this phenomenon; it is also related to migration and declining fertility.\nTrafficking, forced marriage and sex work.\nSome scholars argue that as the proportion of women to men decreases globally, there will be an increase in trafficking and sex work (both forced and self-elected), as many men will be willing to do more to obtain a sexual partner (Junhong 2001). Already, there are reports of women from Vietnam, Myanmar, and North Korea systematically trafficked to mainland China and Taiwan and sold into forced marriages. Moreover, Ullman and Fidell (1989) suggested that pornography and sex-related crimes of violence (i.e., rape and molestation) would also increase with an increasing sex ratio.\nWidening of the gender social gap.\nAs Park and Cho (1995) note, families in areas with high sex ratios that have mostly sons tend to be smaller than those with mostly daughters (because the families with mostly sons appear to have used sex-selective techniques to achieve their \"ideal\" composition). Particularly in poor areas, large families tend to have more problems with resource allocation, with daughters often receiving fewer resources than sons. Blake (1989) is credited for noting the relationship between family size and childhood \"quality.\" Therefore, if families with daughters continue to be predominantly large, it is likely that the social gap between genders will widen due to traditional cultural discrimination and lack of resource availability.\nGuttentag and Secord (1983) hypothesized that when the proportion of males throughout the world is greater, there is likely to be more violence and war.\nPotential positive effects.\nSome scholars believe that when sex ratios are high, women actually become valued more because of their relative shortage. Park and Cho (1995) suggest that as women become more scarce, they may have \"increased value for conjugal and reproductive functions\" (75). Eventually, this could lead to better social conditions, followed by the birth of more women and sex ratios moving back to natural levels. This claim is supported by the work of demographer Nathan Keifitz. Keifitz (1983) wrote that as women become fewer, their relative position in society will increase. However, to date, no data has supported this claim.\nIt has been suggested by Belanger (2002) that sex-selective abortion may have positive effects on the mother choosing to abort the female fetus. This is related to the historical duty of mothers to produce a son in order to carry on the family name. As previously mentioned, women gain status in society when they have a male child, but not when they have a female child. Oftentimes, bearing of a son leads to greater legitimacy and agency for the mother. In some regions of the world where son preference is especially strong, sonless women are treated as outcasts. In this way, sex-selective abortion is a way for women to select for male fetuses, helping secure greater family status.\nGoodkind (1999) argues that sex-selective abortion should not be banned purely because of its discriminatory nature. Instead, he argues, we must consider the overall lifetime possibilities of discrimination. In fact, it is possible that sex-selective abortion takes away much of the discrimination women would face later in life. Since families have the option of selecting for the fetal sex they desire, if they choose not to abort a female fetus, she is more likely to be valued later in life. In this way, sex-selective abortion may be a more humane alternative to infanticide, abandonment, or neglect. Goodkind (1999) poses an essential philosophical question, \"if a ban were enacted against prenatal sex testing (or the use of abortion for sex-selective purposes), how many excess postnatal deaths would a society be willing to tolerate in lieu of whatever sex-selective abortions were avoided?\"\nControversies.\nThere are many controversies surrounding sex-selective abortion. Just like the practice of sex-selective abortion has been criticized, the solutions proposed or enacted by governments have also been criticized. Eklund &amp; Purewal argued that the response to a patriarchal practice (sex selection) should not be another patriarchal practice (restricting women's reproductive rights), as such a situation creates a cycle: women's social status is lowered, which in turn leads to more sex-selective abortions. The association of public discourse on sex-selective abortion with the anti-abortion movement also complicates the situation. Furthermore, access to safe abortion is seen by some as important from a public health perspective; in India, although the abortion law is relatively liberal, most efforts are put into preventing sex-selective abortion, rather than adequate access to safe abortion, as a result nearly 78% of all abortions in India take place outside of health facilities, with such unsafe abortions representing the third largest cause of maternal death in India. Another controversy in that of population planning campaigns such as the one child policy in China, and efforts from the governments of several Asian countries, including India and South Korea, from the 1970s onward to limit the number of children a family could have, which have intensified the desire to quickly have a son. An article by Al Jazeera titled \"How Western family planners helped curb the birth of girls in developing countries, the effects of which are felt today\" claimed that it was such population policies (which included forced sterilization), which were fully supported, even pushed by the West, that contributed to unbalanced sex ratios.\nSex-selective abortion in the context of abortion.\nMacPherson estimates that 100,000 sex-selective abortions every year continue to be performed in India. For a contrasting perspective, in the United States with a population &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444th of India, over 1.2 million abortions every year were performed between 1990 and 2007. In England and Wales with a population &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204420th of India, over 189,000 abortions were performed in 2011, or a yearly rate of 17.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344. The average for the European Union was 30 abortions per year per 1,000 women.\nMany scholars have noted the difficulty in reconciling the discriminatory nature of sex-selective abortion with the right of women to have control over their own bodies. This conflict manifests itself primarily when discussing laws about sex-selective abortion. Weiss (1995:205) writes: \"The most obvious challenge sex-selective abortion represents for pro-choice feminists is the difficulty of reconciling a pro-choice position with moral objections one might have to sex selective abortion (especially since it has been used primarily on female fetuses), much less the advocacy of a law banning sex-selective abortion.\"\nAs a result, arguments both for and against sex-selective abortion are typically highly reflective of one's own personal beliefs about abortion in general. Warren (1985:104) argues that there is a difference between acting within one's rights and acting upon the most morally sound choice, implying that sex-selective abortion might be within rights but not morally sound. Warren also notes that, if we are to ever reverse the trend of sex-selective abortion and high sex ratios, we must work to change the patriarchy-based society which breeds the strong son preference.\nLaws against sex-selective abortion, especially those that exist in some U.S. states, are controversial, because it is not clear how they can be enforced, and pro-choice activists argue that such laws are brought by anti-abortion movement forces who are using this as a pretext to restrict women's access to safe and legal abortion and to harass doctors who perform abortions: NARAL states that \"For many years, anti-choice lawmakers have tried to ban abortion using every possible reason and excuse \u2013including, now, on the grounds of purported concern about race or sex selection.\" There is concern that such bans may put women who seek sex-selective abortions in danger because they may seek unsafe abortions, and that these bans do not address the root cause of sex-selective abortion, including the pregnant women's fear that they or their future daughters will suffer abuse, violence and stigmatization.\nLaws, campaigns and policies against sex-selective abortion.\nInternational.\nThe practice of prenatal sex selection has been condemned internationally. It is often seen as a result of discriminatory social views which consider females inferior to males. In 1994 over 180 states signed the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, agreeing to \"eliminate all forms of discrimination against the girl child\". In 2011 the resolution of PACE's Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men condemned the practice of prenatal sex selection.\nBy country.\nMany nations have attempted to address sex-selective abortion rates through a combination of media campaigns and policy initiatives.\nIn 2013, Conservative MP Mark Warawa introduced a motion condemning discrimination against females through sex-selective abortion but which ultimately never came to a vote. In 2021, Conservative Cathay Wagantall introduced a private member's bill that would prohibit a medical practitioner from performing a sex-selective abortion. Although the bill was defeated 248-82, a majority of Conservative MPs voted in favour of the bill.\nThe United States Congress has debated legislation that would outlaw the practice. The legislation ultimately failed to pass in the House of Representatives.\nOn the state level, laws against sex-selective abortions have been passed in a number of U.S. states; the law passed in Arizona in 2011 prohibits both sex-selective and race-selective abortion.\nThe law on sex-selective abortion is unresolved in the United Kingdom. In order for an abortion to be legal, doctors need to show that continuing the pregnancy could threaten the physical or mental health of the mother. In a recent case, two doctors were caught on camera offering a sex-selective abortion but the Director of Public Prosecution deemed it not in the public interest to proceed with the prosecution. Following this incidence, MPs voted 181 to 1 for a Bill put forward by Tessa Munt and 11 other MPs aiming to end confusion about the legality of this practice. Organisations such as BPAS and Abortion Rights have been lobbying for the decriminalisation of sex-selective abortions.\nChina's government has increasingly recognized its role in a reduction of the national sex ratio. As a result, since 2005, it has sponsored a \"boys and girls are equal campaign.\" For example, in 2000, the Chinese government began the \"Care for Girls\" Initiative. Furthermore, several levels of government have been modified to protect the \"political, economic, cultural, and social\" rights of women. Finally, the Chinese government has enacted policies and interventions to help reduce the sex ratio at birth. In 2005, sex-selective abortion was made illegal in China. This came in response to the ever-increasing sex ratio and a desire to try to detract from it and reach a more normal ratio. The sex ratio among firstborn children in urban areas from 2000 to 2005 did not rise at all, so there is hope that this movement is taking hold across the nation.\nUNICEF and UNFPA have partnered with the Chinese government and grassroots-level women's groups such as All China Women's Federation to promote gender equality in policy and practice, as well engage various social campaigns to help lower birth sex ratio and to reduce excess female child mortality rates.\nIn India, according to a 2007 study by MacPherson, Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PCPNDT Act) was highly publicized by NGOs and the government. Many of the ads used depicted abortion as violent, creating fear of abortion itself within the population. The ads focused on the religious and moral shame associated with abortion. MacPherson claims this media campaign was not effective because some perceived this as an attack on their character, leading to many becoming closed off, rather than opening a dialogue about the issue. This emphasis on morality, claims MacPherson, increased fear and shame associated with all abortions, leading to an increase in unsafe abortions in India.\nThe government of India, in a 2011 report, has begun better educating all stakeholders about its MTP and PCPNDT laws. In its communication campaigns, it is clearing up public misconceptions by emphasizing that sex determination is illegal, but abortion is legal for certain medical conditions in India. The government is also supporting implementation of programs and initiatives that seek to reduce gender discrimination, including media campaign to address the underlying social causes of sex selection.\nOther recent policy initiatives adopted by numerous states of India, claims Guilmoto, attempt to address the assumed economic disadvantage of girls by offering support to girls and their parents. These policies provide conditional cash transfer and scholarships only available to girls, where payments to a girl and her parents are linked to each stage of her life, such as when she is born, completion of her childhood immunization, her joining school at grade 1, her completing school grades 6, 9 and 12, her marriage past age 21. Some states are offering higher pension benefits to parents who raise one or two girls. Different states of India have been experimenting with various innovations in their girl-driven welfare policies. For example, the state of Delhi adopted a pro-girl policy initiative (locally called \"Laadli scheme\"), which initial data suggests may be lowering the birth sex ratio in the state.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Armed conflict continued intermittently from 1 August 1927 until Communist victory resulted in their total control over mainland China on 10 December 1949.\nThe war is generally divided into two phases with an interlude: from August 1927 to 1937, the First United Front alliance of the KMT and CCP collapsed during the Northern Expedition, and the Nationalists controlled most of China. From 1937 to 1945, hostilities were mostly put on hold as the Second United Front fought the Japanese invasion of China with eventual help from the Allies of World War II. However, armed clashes between the groups remained common. Exacerbating the divisions within China further was the formation of the Wang Jingwei regime, a Japan-sponsored puppet government led by Wang Jingwei, which was established to nominally govern the regions of China that came under Japanese occupation.\nThe civil war resumed as soon as it became apparent that Japanese defeat was imminent, with the communists gaining the upper hand in the second phase of the war from 1945 to 1949, generally referred to as the Chinese Communist Revolution. The Communists gained control of mainland China and proclaimed the People's Republic of China in 1949, forcing the leadership of the Republic of China to retreat to the island of Taiwan. Starting in the 1950s, a lasting political and military stand-off between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has ensued, with the ROC in Taiwan and the PRC on the mainland both claiming to be the legitimate government of all China. After the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, both tacitly ceased to engage in open conflict in 1979; however, no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed.\nBackground.\nFollowing the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the 1911 Revolution, Sun Yat-sen assumed the presidency of the newly formed Republic of China, and was shortly thereafter succeeded by Yuan Shikai. Yuan failed in a short-lived attempt to declare himself emperor, and China fell into power struggle after his death in 1916.\nThe Kuomintang (KMT), led by Sun Yat-sen, created a new government in Guangzhou to rival the warlords who ruled over large swathes of China and prevented the formation of a solid central government. After Sun's efforts to obtain aid from Western countries were ignored, he turned to the Soviet Union. In 1923, Sun and Soviet representative Adolph Joffe in Shanghai pledged Soviet assistance to China's unification in the Sun\u2013Joffe Manifesto, a declaration of cooperation among the Comintern, KMT, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Comintern agent Mikhail Borodin arrived in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of both the CCP and the KMT along the lines of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CCP, which was initially a study group, and the KMT jointly formed the First United Front.\nIn 1923, Sun sent Chiang Kai-shek, one of his lieutenants, for several months of military and political study in Moscow. Chiang then became the head of the Whampoa Military Academy that trained the next generation of military leaders. The Soviets provided the academy with teaching material, organization, and equipment, including munitions. They also provided education in many of the techniques for mass mobilization. With this aid, Sun raised a dedicated \"army of the party\", with which he hoped to defeat the warlords militarily. CCP members were also present in the academy, and many of them became instructors, including Zhou Enlai, who was made a political instructor.\nCommunist members were allowed to join the KMT on an individual basis. The CCP itself was still small at the time, having a membership of 300 in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925. As of 1923, the KMT had 50,000 members.\nHowever, after Sun died in 1925, the KMT split into left- and right-wing movements. KMT members worried that the Soviets were trying to destroy the KMT from inside using the CCP. The CCP then began movements in opposition of the Northern Expedition, passing a resolution against it at a party meeting.\nThen, in March 1927, the KMT held its second party meeting where the Soviets helped pass resolutions against the Expedition and curbing Chiang's power. Soon, the KMT would be clearly divided.\nThroughout this time, the Soviet Union sent money and spies to support the CCP. Without their support, the CCP likely would have failed. This is evidenced by documents showing other communist parties in China at the time, one with as many as 10,000 members, which all failed without support from the Soviet Union.\nShanghai massacre and Northern Expedition (1927).\nIn early 1927, the KMT\u2013CCP rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CCP and the left wing of the KMT decided to move the seat of the KMT government from Guangzhou to Wuhan, where communist influence was strong. However, Chiang and Li Zongren, whose armies defeated the warlord Sun Chuanfang, moved eastward toward Jiangxi. The leftists rejected Chiang's demand to eliminate Communist influence within KMT, and Chiang denounced them for betraying Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People by taking orders from the Soviet Union. According to Mao Zedong, Chiang's tolerance of the CCP in the KMT camp decreased as his power increased.\nOn 7 April, Chiang and several other KMT leaders held a meeting, during which they proposed that Communist activities were socially and economically disruptive and had to be undone for the Nationalist revolution to proceed. On 12 April, many communists within the KMT were purged in Shanghai through hundreds of arrests and executions on the orders of General Bai Chongxi. The CCP referred to this as the \"12 April Incident\", the Shanghai massacre, and the beginning of the White Terror. This incident widened the rift between Chiang and Wang Jingwei, the leader of the left wing faction of the KMT. The left wing of the KMT also expelled CCP members from the Wuhan Government, which in turn was toppled by Chiang Kai-shek. The KMT resumed its campaign against the warlords and captured Beijing in June 1928. Soon, most of eastern China was under the control of the Nanjing central government, which received prompt international recognition as the sole legitimate government of China. The KMT government announced, in conformity with Sun Yat-sen, the formula for the three stages of revolution: military unification, political tutelage, and constitutional democracy.\nCommunist insurgency (1927\u20131937).\nOn 1 August 1927, the CCP launched an uprising in Nanchang against the Nationalist government in Wuhan. This conflict led to the creation of the Red Army. On 4 August, the main forces of the Red Army left Nanchang and headed southwards for an assault on Guangdong. Nationalist forces quickly reoccupied Nanchang while the remaining members of the CCP in Nanchang went into hiding. A CCP meeting on 7 August confirmed the objective of the party was to seize political power by force, but the CCP was quickly suppressed the next day by the Nationalist government in Wuhan, led by Wang Jingwei. On 14 August, Chiang Kai-shek announced his temporary retirement, as the Wuhan faction and Nanjing faction of the Kuomintang were allied once again with common goal of suppressing the CCP after the earlier split. Wang Jingwei took the leadership of KMT after Chiang.\nAttempts were later made by the CCP to take the cities of Changsha, Shantou and Guangzhou. The Red Army consisting of mutinous former National Revolutionary Army (NRA) soldiers as well as armed peasants established control over several areas in southern China. KMT forces continued to attempt to suppress the rebellions. Then, in September, Wang Jingwei was forced out of Wuhan. September also saw an unsuccessful armed rural insurrection, known as the Autumn Harvest Uprising, led by Mao Zedong. Borodin then returned to the Soviet Union in October via Mongolia. In November, Chiang Kai-shek went to Shanghai and invited Wang to join him. On 11 December, the CCP started the Guangzhou Uprising, establishing a soviet there the next day, but lost the city by 13 December to a counter-attack under the orders of General Zhang Fakui. On 16 December, Wang Jingwei fled to France. There were now three capitals in China: the internationally recognized republic capital in Beijing, the CCP and left-wing KMT at Wuhan and the right-wing KMT regime at Nanjing, which would remain the KMT capital for the next decade.\nThis marked the beginning of a ten-year armed struggle, known in mainland China as the \"Ten-Year Civil War\" (\u5341\u5e74\u5185\u6218) which ended with the Xi'an Incident, when Chiang Kai-shek was forced to form the Second United Front against invading forces from the Empire of Japan. In 1930, the Central Plains War broke out as an internal conflict of the KMT; launched by Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan, and Wang Jingwei. The attention was turned to root out remaining pockets of CCP activity in a series of five encirclement campaigns. The first and second campaigns failed, and the third was aborted due to the Mukden Incident. The fourth campaign (1932\u20131933) achieved some early successes, but Chiang's armies were badly mauled when they tried to penetrate into the heart of Mao's Soviet Chinese Republic. During these campaigns, KMT columns struck swiftly into CCP areas, but were easily engulfed by the vast countryside and were not able to consolidate their foothold.\nFinally, in late 1934, Chiang launched a fifth campaign that involved the systematic encirclement of the Jiangxi Soviet region with fortified blockhouses. The blockhouse strategy was devised and implemented in part by newly hired Nazi advisors. Unlike previous campaigns in which they penetrated deeply in a single strike, this time the KMT troops patiently built blockhouses, each separated by about , to surround the Communist areas and cut off their supplies and food sources.\nThe Long March.\nIn October 1934, the CCP took advantage of gaps in the ring of blockhouses (manned by the forces of a warlord ally of Chiang Kai-shek's, rather than regular KMT troops) and broke out of the encirclement. The warlord armies were reluctant to challenge Communist forces for fear of losing their own men and did not pursue the CCP with much fervor. In addition, the main KMT forces were preoccupied with annihilating Zhang Guotao's army, which was much larger than Mao's. The massive military retreat of Communist forces lasted a year and covered what Mao estimated as 12,500\u00a0km (25,000 Li); it became known as the Long March.\nThis military retreat was undertaken by the Chinese Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, to evade the pursuit or attack of the Kuomintang army. It consisted of a series of marches, during which numerous Communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west. Over the course of the march from Jiangxi the First Front Army, led by an inexperienced military commission, was on the brink of annihilation by Chiang Kai-Shek's troops as their stronghold was in Jiangxi. The Communists, under the command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, \"escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed over 9,000 kilometers over 370 days.\" The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, and then northwards towards Shaanxi. \"In November 1935, shortly after settling in northern Shaanxi, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the Red Army. Following a major reshuffling of official roles, Mao became the chairman of the Military Commission, with Zhou and Deng Xiaoping as vice-chairmen.\" This marked Mao's position as the preeminent leader of the CCP, with Zhou in second position to him.\nThe march ended when the CCP reached the interior of Shaanxi. Zhang Guotao's army (Red 4th Front Army), which took a different route through northwest China, was largely destroyed by the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his Chinese Muslim allies, the Ma clique. Along the way, the Communist army confiscated property and weapons from local warlords and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor, solidifying its appeal to the masses. Of the 90,000\u2013100,000 people who began the Long March from the Soviet Chinese Republic, only around 7,000\u20138,000 made it to Shaanxi. The remnants of Zhang's forces eventually joined Mao in Shaanxi, but with his army destroyed, Zhang, even as a founding member of the CCP, was never able to challenge Mao's authority. Essentially, the great retreat made Mao the undisputed leader of the Chinese Communist Party.\nThe Kuomintang used Khampa troops\u00a0\u2013 who were former bandits\u00a0\u2013 to battle the Communist Red Army as it advanced and to undermine local warlords who often refused to fight Communist forces to conserve their own strength. The KMT enlisted 300 \"Khampa bandits\" into its Consolatory Commission military in Sichuan, where they were part of the effort of the central government to penetrate and destabilize local Han warlords such as Liu Wenhui. The government was seeking to exert full control over frontier areas against the warlords. Liu had refused to battle the Communists in order to conserve his army. The Consolatory Commission forces were used to battle the Red Army, but they were defeated when their religious leader was captured by the Communists.\nJapanese expansionism and united front negotiations.\nIn 1931, the Empire of Japan invaded Manchuria. Although the Japanese expansionism in China posed a clear threat to both sides of the civil war, at first it did not lead to a cessation of hostilities. Rather, Chiang believed that \"The Japanese are a disease of the skin. The Communists are a disease of the heart.\" He ordered his general in Manchuria not to resist the Japanese advance and instead focused on continuing the encirclement campaigns in the south. He called this policy \"first internal pacification, then external resistance.\" The CCP in turn reacted with disdain to Chiang's policy of nonresistance, viewing him as a pawn of the Japanese. They saw fighting the Nationalist government as an essential part of resistance to Japan and called for \"Resisting Japan and Opposing Chiang\".\nNonetheless, prosecuting the civil war while also resisting Japan became increasingly impractical for the CCP in particular. Already by late 1932, Communist guerilla groups in Manchuria had begun to cooperate with Nationalist guerillas against the Japanese occupiers. The CCP also began to come under pressure from the Soviet Union to negotiate an end to the civil war. The USSR was concerned with events in Europe\u2014especially Hitler's rise to power\u2014and wanted Communist parties to form united fronts with moderates to resist fascist aggression. This policy was formally adopted by the 7th World Congress of the Comintern in the summer of 1935. The CCP delegation at the Congress, headed by Wang Ming, published the \"August 1 Declaration\" describing how a united front could be created in China. They recommended a government of national defense including all parties in China that wanted to resist Japanese imperialism. Importantly, because they still considered Chiang to be a \"running dog\" of the Japanese, they did not extend this offer to the Nationalist government.\nThe CCP itself was in the middle of the Long March during the Comintern Congress and was cut off from radio communication with Moscow. Its leaders learned of the Congress's decisions in November 1935. The following month, they held a conference at Wayaobu to discuss the implications of this new Comintern policy. The Wayaobu Manifesto that they published was a significant retreat from the hardline positions they had held during the early civil war. It called for \"the most broad national united front\" to resist Japan, and announced that the CCP was willing to suspend class conflict in the interests of cross-class collaboration. However, they did not intend for the Chinese Red Army to surrender or submit to the Nationalists. On the contrary, their plan to resist the Japanese centered on expanding the Red Army to 1 million men and dramatically increasing the land area covered by the Chinese Soviet Republic.\nIn late 1935 relations between Nanjing and Tokyo took a sharp downturn as Japan stepped up its expansionist policies in north China. Chiang Kai-shek feared that a full-scale invasion of China was imminent, and wanted to secure the material and diplomatic support of the Soviet Union. He also faced growing public pressure to actively resist Japan; on 9 December 1935, for example, a major student protest broke out in Beiping. In January, Chiang Kai-shek sent emissaries to Moscow to negotiate a military mutual assistance treaty. However, as a precondition for a treaty, Chiang wanted the Soviet Union to order the CCP to submit to the Nationalist Government. The Soviet ambassador told Chiang that while the USSR hoped the CCP would agree to a unified command under the Nationalists, Chiang would have to negotiate directly with the CCP. This upset Chiang, who worried that if the USSR was unwilling to order the CCP to stop, they might be willing to support further revolutionary actions by the CCP if a ceasefire broke down. Progress halted, and after news leaked to the press that Chiang was contemplating a treaty with the USSR, he called off negotiations.\nMeanwhile, the CCP opened up separate negotiations with the Nationalist forces besieging them in northwest China. They managed to sign secret ceasefire agreements with Zhang Xueliang, leader of the Northeastern Army, and Yang Hucheng, leader of the Northwestern Army. These generals were frustrated that Chiang' was prioritizing Civil War over resistance to Japan. Yan Xishan, another neighboring warlord, also signed a secret agreement with the Communists, although he was not as closely aligned with them as Zhang or Yang. The members of this northwestern alliance were united by their desire to resist Japan, but they differed over the details of how this could best be accomplished. The Communists supported a plan to use Soviet support to take over Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang and turn northwest China into a base under Zhang's command to resist Japan and oppose Chiang. Zhang, Yang, and Yan were still committed to convincing Chiang to lead the anti-Japanese resistance. As they continued to negotiate, they kept their alliance secret and even staged fake military battles to allay the suspicions of the Nanjing government. \nNegotiations between Chiang and the CCP began in earnest in late 1936. Chiang continued to try to resolve the civil war militarily; he continued to consider a negotiated settlement with the CCP to be a last resort. He was encouraged by the results of the Ningxia campaign in mid-to-late October. In that campaign, the Second and Fourth Corps of the Red Army marched north to pick up supplies dropped in Mongolia by the Soviet Union, but found themselves trapped on the wrong side of the Yellow River. They were cut to pieces by the Hui cavalry allied with the Nationalists. Chiang began making preparations for a sixth encirclement campaign, and instructed Zhang and Yang to participate. In early November, Chen Lifu presented Pan Hannian with a set of extremely harsh conditions for a deal. Pan balked, calling them \"conditions for surrender\". In late November, Chiang ordered the Northeastern Army and forces from the central Nationalist Army, Hu Zongnan's Right Route Army, to attack towards the Communist capital at Bao'an. At the resulting Battle of Shanchengbao, the Northeastern Army withheld most of its forces from the attack. This allowed the Red Army to ambush and nearly wipe out Hu's 78th regiment. This reversed the diplomatic situation: Chen Lifu moderated his conditions, but the CCP recalled Pan Hannian from Nanjing on December 10.\nIn late 1936, Zhang Xueliang decided that his repeated attempts to persuade Chiang to create a united front with the Communists were not going to be enough. To Zhang, Chiang appeared dead-set on continuing the Civil War even as the threat of Japanese invasion loomed ever larger. Following Yang Hucheng's advice, he decided to resort to drastic measures. On 12 December 1936, the disgruntled Zhang and Yang conspired to kidnap Chiang and force him into a truce with the CCP. The incident became known as the Xi'an Incident. Both parties suspended fighting to form a Second United Front to focus their energies and fight the Japanese.\nSecond Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945).\nIn 1937, Japan launched its full-scale invasion of China and its well-equipped troops overran KMT defenders in northern and coastal China.\nThe alliance of CCP and KMT was in name only. Unlike the KMT forces, CCP troops shunned conventional warfare and instead waged guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. The level of actual cooperation and coordination between the CCP and KMT during World War II was minimal. In the midst of the Second United Front, the CCP and the KMT were still vying for territorial advantage in \"Free China\" (i.e., areas not occupied by the Japanese or ruled by Japanese puppet governments such as Manchukuo and the Reorganized National Government of China).\nThe situation came to a head in late 1940 and early 1941 when clashes between Communist and KMT forces intensified. Chiang demanded in December 1940 that the CCP's New Fourth Army evacuate Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces, due to its provocation and harassment of KMT forces in this area. Under intense pressure, the New Fourth Army commanders complied. The following year they were ambushed by KMT forces during their evacuation, which led to several thousand deaths. It also ended the Second United Front, formed earlier to fight the Japanese.\nAs clashes between the CCP and KMT intensified, countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union attempted to prevent a disastrous civil war. After the New Fourth Army incident, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent special envoy Lauchlin Currie to talk with Chiang Kai-shek and KMT party leaders to express their concern regarding the hostility between the two parties, with Currie stating that the only ones to benefit from a civil war would be the Japanese. The Soviet Union, allied more closely with the CCP, sent an imperative telegram to Mao in 1941, warning that civil war would also make the situation easier for the Japanese military. Due to the international community's efforts, there was a temporary and superficial peace. Chiang criticized the CCP in 1943 with the propaganda piece \"China's Destiny\", which questioned the CCP's power after the war, while the CCP strongly opposed Chiang's leadership and referred to his regime as fascist in an attempt to generate a negative public image. Both leaders knew that a deadly battle had begun between themselves.\nIn general, developments in the Second Sino-Japanese War were to the advantage of the CCP, as its guerrilla war tactics had won them popular support within the Japanese-occupied areas. In occupied areas, the Communists established military and political bases from which it carried out guerilla warfare.35 The Communists built popular support in these areas, returning land to poor peasants, reducing peasant's rent, and arming the people.35 By Spring 1945, there were 19 Communist-governed areas in China in which 95 million people lived.36 In Fall 1945, the Communist armies had 1.27 million men and were supported by 2.68 million militia members.36 The KMT had to defend the country against the main Japanese campaigns, since it was the legal Chinese government, a factor which proved costly to Chiang Kai-shek and his troops. Japan launched its last major offensive against the KMT, Operation Ichi-Go, in 1944, which resulted in the severe weakening of Chiang's forces. The CCP also suffered fewer losses through its guerrilla tactics.\nImmediate post-war clashes (1945\u20131946).\nUnder the terms of the Japanese unconditional surrender dictated by the Allies, Japanese troops were to surrender to KMT troops but not to the CCP, which was present in some of the occupied areas as well. In Manchuria, however, where the KMT had no forces, the Japanese surrendered to the Soviet Union. Chiang Kai-shek reminded Japanese troops to remain at their posts to receive the KMT, but Communist forces soon began taking surrenders from the Japanese and fighting those who resisted. General Wedemeyer of the United States Army became alarmed at these developments and wanted seven American divisions to be sent to China, but General Marshall replied that it should not be given priority over Japan and Korea.\nThe first post-war peace negotiation, attended by both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong, was in Chongqing from 28 August to 10 October 1945. Chiang entered the meeting at an advantage because he had recently signed a friendly treaty with the Soviet Union while the Communists were still forcing the Japanese to surrender in some places. Mao was accompanied by American ambassador Patrick J. Hurley, who was devoted to Chiang but also wanted to ensure Mao's safety in light of the past history between the two Chinese leaders. It concluded with the signing of the Double Tenth Agreement. Both sides stressed the importance of a peaceful reconstruction, but the conference did not produce any concrete results. Battles between the two sides continued even as peace negotiations were in progress, until the agreement was reached in January 1946. However, large campaigns and full-scale confrontations between the CCP and Chiang's troops were temporarily avoided. On 26 November 1945, Hurley resigned, viewing Chiang as having gone against his agreement with the Communists.53 In December 1945, Hurley's former position was filled by Marshall.54\nIn the last month of World War II in East Asia, Soviet forces launched the huge Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation against the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria and along the Chinese-Mongolian border. This operation destroyed the Kwantung Army in just three weeks and left the USSR occupying all of Manchuria by the end of the war in a total power vacuum of local Chinese forces. Consequently, the 700,000 Japanese troops stationed in the region surrendered. Later in the year Chiang Kai-shek realized that he lacked the resources to prevent a CCP takeover of Manchuria following the scheduled Soviet departure. He therefore made a deal with the Soviets to delay their withdrawal until he had moved enough of his best-trained men and modern materiel into the region. However, the Soviets refused permission for the Nationalist troops to traverse its territory and spent the extra time systematically dismantling the extensive Manchurian industrial base (worth up to $2\u00a0billion) and shipping it back to their war-ravaged country. KMT troops were then airlifted by the US to occupy key cities in North China, while the countryside was already dominated by the CCP. On 15 November 1945, the KMT began a campaign to prevent the CCP from strengthening its already strong base. At the same time, however, the return of the KMT also brought widespread graft and corruption, with an OSS officer remarking that the only winners were the Communists.\nIn the winter of 1945\u20131946, Joseph Stalin commanded Marshal Rodion Malinovsky to give Mao Zedong most Imperial Japanese Army weapons that were captured.\nChiang Kai-shek's forces pushed as far as Jinzhou by 26 November 1945, meeting with little resistance. This was followed by a Communist offensive on the Shandong Peninsula that was largely successful, as all of the peninsula, except what was controlled by the US, fell to the Communists. The truce fell apart in June 1946 when full-scale war between CCP and KMT forces broke out on 26 June 1946. China then entered a state of civil war that lasted more than three years.\nResumed fighting (1946\u20131949).\nBackground and disposition of forces.\nBy the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the power of the Chinese Communist Party grew considerably. Their main force grew to 1.2\u00a0million troops, backed with additional militia of 2\u00a0million, totalling 3.2\u00a0million troops.36 Their \"Liberated Zone\" in 1945 contained 19 base areas,36 including one-quarter of the country's territory and one-third of its population; this included many important towns and cities. Moreover, the Soviet Union turned over all of its captured Japanese weapons and a substantial amount of their own supplies to the Communists, who received Northeastern China from the Soviets as well.\nIn March 1946, despite repeated requests from Chiang, the Soviet Red Army under the command of Marshal Rodion Malinovsky continued to delay pulling out of Manchuria, while Malinovsky secretly told the CCP forces to move in behind them, which led to full-scale war for the control of the Northeast. These favorable conditions also facilitated many changes inside the Communist leadership: the more radical hard-line faction who wanted a complete military take-over of China finally gained the upper hand and defeated the careful opportunists. Before giving control to Communist leaders, on 27 March, Soviet diplomats requested a joint venture of industrial development with the Nationalist Party in Manchuria.\nAlthough General Marshall stated that he knew of no evidence that the CCP was being supplied by the Soviet Union, the CCP was able to utilize a large number of weapons abandoned by the Japanese, including some tanks. When large numbers of well-trained KMT troops began to defect to the Communist forces, the CCP was finally able to achieve material superiority. The CCP's most effective political reform was its land reform policy. This drew the massive number of landless and starving peasants in the countryside into the Communist cause. This strategy enabled the CCP to access an extensive supply of manpower for both combat and logistical purposes; despite suffering heavy casualties throughout many of the war's campaigns, manpower continued to grow. For example, during the Huaihai Campaign alone the CCP was able to mobilize 5,430,000 peasants to fight against the KMT forces.\nAfter the war with the Japanese ended, Chiang Kai-shek quickly moved KMT troops to newly liberated areas to prevent Communist forces from receiving the Japanese surrender. The US airlifted many KMT troops from central China to the Northeast (Manchuria). President Harry S. Truman was very clear about what he described as \"using the Japanese to hold off the Communists\". In his memoirs he writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was perfectly clear to us that if we told the Japanese to lay down their arms immediately and march to the seaboard, the entire country would be taken over by the Communists. We therefore had to take the unusual step of using the enemy as a garrison until we could airlift Chinese National troops to South China and send Marines to guard the seaports. \u2014\u200a\nUsing the pretext of \"receiving the Japanese surrender\", business interests within the KMT government occupied most of the banks, factories and commercial properties, which had previously been seized by the Imperial Japanese Army. They also conscripted troops at an accelerated pace from the civilian population and hoarded supplies, preparing for a resumption of war with the Communists. These hasty and harsh preparations caused great hardship for the residents of cities such as Shanghai, where the unemployment rate rose dramatically to 37.5%.\nHyperinflation meant those employed in the Kuomintang forces lost the purchasing power of their pay. This resulted in corruption and the embezzlement of supplies which disappeared into the barter economy. Ordinary Kuomintang soldiers were often malnourished and desertion was common.\nThe US strongly supported the Kuomintang forces. About 50,000 US soldiers were sent to guard strategic sites in Hebei and Shandong in Operation Beleaguer. The US equipped and trained KMT troops, and transported Japanese and Koreans back to help KMT forces to occupy liberated zones as well as to contain Communist-controlled areas. According to William Blum, American aid included substantial amounts of mostly surplus military supplies, and loans were made to the KMT. Within less than two years after the Sino-Japanese War, the KMT had received $4.43\u00a0billion from the US\u00a0\u2013 most of which was military aid. Highlighting the aid provided by the US to the KMT, the Communists' position was that the US was stirring domestic warfare and characterized the civil war as both a national revolution against the KMT and a revolution against US colonization and aggression.\nOutbreak of war.\nAs postwar negotiations between the Nationalist government and the CCP failed, the civil war between these two parties resumed. This stage of war is referred to in CCP historiography as the \"War of Liberation\" (). On 20 July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale assault on Communist territory in North China with 113 brigades (a total of 1.6\u00a0million troops).\nKnowing their disadvantages in manpower and equipment, the CCP executed a \"passive defense\" strategy. It avoided the strong points of the KMT army and was prepared to abandon territory in order to preserve its forces. In most cases the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. The CCP also attempted to wear out the KMT forces as much as possible. This tactic seemed to be successful; after a year, the power balance became more favorable to the CCP. They wiped out 1.12\u00a0million KMT troops, while their strength grew to about two million men.\nIn March 1947, the KMT achieved a symbolic victory by seizing Yan'an, the capital of the Yan'an Soviet. The Communists counterattacked soon afterwards. With KMT efforts for an all-out offensive failing, the Nationalists changed strategy from broad assaults to concentrating on key targets, including Communist-controlled areas in Shandong and Shaanxi.56 This approach also failed.56\nFrom June to September 1947, the Communists launched offensives and Nationalist-controlled areas became the primary battlefields.56 On 30 June 1947, CCP troops crossed the Yellow River and moved to the Dabie Mountains area, restored and developed the Central Plain. The crossing ruined the Nationalists' plans to use the river as a defense line.84 At the same time, Communist forces also began to counterattack in Northeastern China, North China and East China.\nThe period of August 1948 through October 1949 included the three most significant Communist military campaigns of the civil war: the Liaoshen Campaign (northeast China), Huaihai Campaign (east China), and Pingjin Campaign (Beijing-Tianjin).57\nThe Liaoshen campaign was launched on 12 September 1948 and led by Lin Biao.57 The main focus of the campaign was Jinzhou.57 On 14 October, the Communists launched an all-out assault and captured the city in 24 hours.57 Most of the 90,000 Nationalists casualties in this battle were incorporated into the Communist ranks.57 The siege of Changchun ended on 19 October when the Nationalist garrison surrendered.57 On 1 November, the Communists captured Shenyang.57 By late 1948, the CCP had taken control of the Northeast through the decisive Liaoshen Campaign. \nThe capture of large KMT units provided the CCP with the tanks, heavy artillery and other combined-arms assets needed to execute offensive operations south of the Great Wall. By April 1948, the city of Luoyang fell, cutting the KMT army off from Xi'an. Following a fierce battle, the CCP captured Jinan and Shandong province on 24 September 1948. During this period, Battle of Weixian took place, which was an important battle for the CCP to liberate Shandong. Through the Weixian Campaign, the CCP controlled the Jiaoji Railway and cut off the connection between Jinan and Qingdao. \nThe Huaihai Campaign of late 1948 and early 1949 secured east-central China for the CCP. It was the largest military operation of the civil war.57 A large number of KMT troops deserted and changed sides in these conflicts. The outcome of these encounters were decisive for the military outcome of the civil war.\nThe Pingjin campaign lasted 64 days, from 21 November 1948 to 31 January 1949. The PLA suffered heavy casualties while securing Zhangjiakou, Tianjin along with its port and garrison at Dagu and Beiping. The CCP brought 890,000 troops from the northeast to oppose some 600,000 KMT troops. There were 40,000 CCP casualties at Zhangjiakou alone. They in turn killed, wounded or captured some 520,000 KMT troops during the campaign. The KMT's defeat in the Pingjin campaign ended its ability to be an effective fighting force on the mainland.58\nAfter achieving decisive victory through the Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin campaigns, the CCP destroyed 144 regular and 29 irregular KMT divisions, including 1.54\u00a0million veteran KMT troops.58 \nStalin initially favored a coalition government in postwar China, and tried to persuade Mao to stop the CCP from crossing the Yangtze and attacking the KMT positions south of the river. Mao rejected Stalin's position and on 21 April, began the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. On 23 April, they captured the KMT's capital, Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until 15 October, Chongqing until 25 November, and then Chengdu before retreating to Taiwan on 7 December. By late 1949, the People's Liberation Army was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet was left. A Chinese Muslim Hui cavalry regiment, the 14th Tungan Cavalry, was sent by the Kuomintang to attack Mongol and Soviet positions along the border during the Pei-ta-shan Incident.\nThe Kuomintang made several last-ditch attempts to use Khampa troops against the Communists in southwest China. The Kuomintang formulated a plan in which three Khampa divisions would be assisted by the Panchen Lama to oppose the Communists. Kuomintang intelligence reported that some Tibetan tusi chiefs and the Khampa Su Yonghe controlled 80,000 troops in Sichuan, Qinghai and Tibet. They hoped to use them against the Communist army.\nPushing south.\nOn 1 October 1949, Mao Zedong officially proclaimed the People's Republic of China with its capital at Beiping, which was returned to the former name Beijing. Chiang Kai-shek and approximately two million Nationalist soldiers retreated from mainland China to the island of Taiwan in December after the PLA advanced into Sichuan province. Isolated Nationalist pockets of resistance remained in the area, but the majority of the resistance collapsed after the fall of Chengdu on 10 December 1949, with some resistance continuing in the far south.\nA PRC attempt to take the ROC-controlled island of Quemoy was thwarted in the Battle of Kuningtou, halting the PLA advance towards Taiwan. In December 1949, Chiang proclaimed Taipei the temporary capital of the Republic of China and continued to assert his government as the sole legitimate authority in China.\nThe Communists' other amphibious operations of 1950 were more successful: they led to the Communist conquest of Hainan Island in April 1950, the Wanshan Islands off the Guangdong coast (May\u2013August 1950), and Zhoushan Island off Zhejiang (May 1950).\nAftermath.\nMost observers expected Chiang's government to eventually fall to the imminent invasion of Taiwan by the People's Liberation Army, and the US was initially reluctant in offering full support for Chiang in their final stand. US President Harry S. Truman announced on 5 January 1950 that the United States would not engage in any dispute involving the Taiwan Strait, and that he would not intervene in the event of an attack by the PRC. Truman, seeking to exploit the possibility of a Titoist-style Sino-Soviet split, announced in his United States Policy toward Formosa that the US would obey the Cairo Declaration's designation of Taiwan as Chinese territory and would not assist the Nationalists. However, the Communist leadership was not aware of this change of policy, instead becoming increasingly hostile to the US. The situation quickly changed after the sudden onset of the Korean War in June 1950. This led to changing political climate in the US, and President Truman ordered the United States Seventh Fleet to sail to the Taiwan Strait as part of the containment policy against potential Communist advance.\nIn June 1949, the ROC declared a \"closure\" of all mainland China ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure was from a point north of the mouth of Min River in Fujian to the mouth of the Liao River in Liaoning. Since mainland China's railroad network was underdeveloped, north\u2013south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland China fishermen.\nDuring the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, KMT troops, who could not retreat to Taiwan, were left behind to fight a guerrilla war against the Communists. These KMT remnants were eliminated in what the PRC called the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries and the According to official statistics from the CCP in 1954, during the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, at least 2.6 million people were arrested, some 1.29 million people were imprisoned, and 712,000 people were executed. Most of those killed were former Kuomintang officials, businessmen, former employees of Western companies and intellectuals whose loyalty was suspect.\nWinning China proper in 1950, also after annexation of Tibet, the CCP controlled the entire mainland in late 1951 (excluding Kinmen and Matsu Islands). But a group of approximately 3,000 KMT Central soldiers retreated to Burma and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China during the Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950\u20131958) and Campaign at the China\u2013Burma Border. Their leader, Li Mi, was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of Yunnan. Initially, the US-supported these remnants and the Central Intelligence Agency provided them with military aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the United Nations in 1953, the US began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954 nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and Li declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times to maintain a base close to China.\nFollowing World War II, civil conflicts erupted in Vietnam. With victory in the civil war and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese communists supported the communist Viet Minh guerrillas against France. The PRC recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in January 1950 and began supplying military equipment in accordance with the agreement of April 1, 1950. By the end of that year, the Viet Minh had secured control over remote regions in northern Vietnam and along the Sino-Vietnamese border, and the communists had consolidated their positions in Laos and Cambodia. This territorial control enabled the flow of supplies and weapons into Vietnam and facilitated the establishment of training camps and base areas. Chinese military aid played a key role in the Viet Minh's victory at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954. The recognition of the DRV by the PRC and other Eastern Bloc countries also prompted the United States and the Western Bloc to recognize the State of Vietnam as a counterweight to the communists. As Chinese communist troops neared complete victory in December 1949, Vietnamese nationalist revolutionary V\u0169 H\u1ed3ng Khanh moved from China to lead a force of Vietnamese, upland minorities, and Kuomintang soldiers toward L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n to attack the Viet Minh and the French. Defeated by both, he crossed over to the State of Vietnam. Some Kuomintang soldiers were sent to Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c for temporary internment and repatriation, but by the late 1950s they were still farming pepper while directing the island militias.\nAfter the ROC complained to the United Nations against the Soviet Union for violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance to support the CCP, the UN General Assembly Resolution 505 was adopted on 1 February 1952, condemning the Soviet Union.\nIn the end, the Communist military forces suffered 1.3\u00a0million combat casualties in the 1945\u20131949 phase of the war: 260,000 killed, 190,000 missing, and 850,000 wounded, discounting irregulars. Nationalist casualties in the same phase were recorded after the war by the PRC: 5,452,700 regulars and 2,258,800 irregulars.\nAfter the formation of the PRC, the PRC government named the Western nations, led by the U.S., as the biggest threat to its national security. Basing this judgment on multiple factors, including the idea of a Chinese century of humiliation at the hands of Western powers beginning in the mid-19th century, U.S. support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the PRC leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the U.S.'s crusade against Communism. As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the PRC leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery.\nTaiwan Strait tensions.\nThough viewed as a military liability by the US, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in Fujian as vital for any future campaign to defeat the PRC and retake mainland China. On 3 September 1954, the First Taiwan Strait Crisis started with the PRC shelling Kinmen. The PRC captured the Yijiangshan Islands on 19 January 1955, leading to the ROC abandoning the Dachen Islands the following month. On 24 January 1955, the United States Congress passed the Formosa Resolution authorizing the President to defend the ROC's offshore islands. The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis ended during the Bandung conference.\nThe Second Taiwan Strait Crisis began on 23 August 1958 with air and naval engagements between PRC and ROC forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of Kinmen by the PRC and Xiamen by the ROC, and ended on November of the same year. PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands from ROC supply ships. Though the US rejected Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to bomb mainland China artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided amphibious assault ships to land supplies, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On 7 September, the US escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing.\nThe third crisis occurred in 1995\u201396. The PRC responded to Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States, and the U.S. recognition of Lee as a representative of Taiwan, with military exercises. The exercises were also meant to deter Taiwanese voters from supporting Lee in the 1996 election; Lee won the election. Two U.S. aircraft carriers were deployed during the crisis; they were not attacked and deescalation followed.\nUS Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022 triggered PRC military exercises across the Taiwan Strait. She originally intended to travel to Taiwan in April 2022, but was delayed due to COVID-19. She rescheduled the trip to August as part of a wider Asian trip. The White House was reported to have been initially divided over the appropriateness of the trip but later affirmed Pelosi's right to visit Taiwan. As a result, the PLA announced four days of unprecedented military live-fire drills, in six zones that encircle the island on the busiest international waterways and aviation routes. In response to the announcement, ROC officials complained that the PRC's live-fire drills were an invasion of Taiwan's territorial space and a direct challenge to free air and sea navigation.\nPolitical fallout.\nOn 25 October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly admitted the PRC and expelled the ROC, which had been a founding member of the United Nations and was one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Representatives of Chiang Kai-shek refused to recognise their accreditations as representatives of China and left the assembly. Recognition for the People's Republic of China soon followed from most other member nations, including the United States.\nBy 1984, PRC and ROC began to de-escalate their hostilities through diplomatic relations with each other, and cross-straits trade and investment has been growing ever since. The state of war was officially declared over by the ROC in 1991. Despite the end of the hostilities, the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war. According to Mao Zedong, there were three ways of \"staving off imperialist intervention in the short term\" during the continuation of the Chinese Communist Revolution. The first was through a rapid completion of the military takeover of the country, and through showing determination and strength against \"foreign attempts at challenging the new regime along its borders\". The second was by \"formalising a comprehensive military alliance with the Soviet Union\", which would dedicate Soviet power to directly defending China against its enemies; this aspect became extensively significant given the backdrop of the start of the Cold War. And finally, the regime had to \"root out its domestic opponents: the heads of secret societies, religious sects, independent unions, or tribal and ethnic organisations\". By destroying the basis of domestic reaction, Mao believed a safer world for the Chinese Communist Revolution to spread in would come into existence.\nUnder the new ROC president Lee Teng-hui, the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion was renounced in May 1991, thus ending the chances of the Kuomintang's quest to retake the mainland. In July 1999, Lee announced a \"special diplomatic relationship\". China was furious again, but the military drills were stopped by the 921 earthquakes. It was the last tense moment of this civil war.\nWith the election in 2000 of Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian, a party other than the KMT gained the presidency for the first time in Taiwan. The new president did not share the Chinese nationalist ideology of the KMT and CCP. This led to tension between the two sides, although trade and other ties such as the 2005 Pan-Blue visit continued to increase.\nWith the election of pro-mainland President Ma Ying-jeou (KMT) in 2008, significant warming of relations resumed between Taipei and Beijing, with high-level exchanges between the semi-official diplomatic organizations of both states such as the Chen-Chiang summit series. Although the Taiwan Strait remains a potential flash point, regular direct air links were established in 2009.\nAnalysis.\nThe Communist victory over the Nationalists is regarded as one of the most impressive twentieth century insurgent victories. Historians and political scientists cite a number of factors, including the CCP's success at mobilizing mass support and the shortcomings of the Nationalist government.\nPoor governance by Nationalists.\nAlmost all studies of the failure of the Nationalist government identify hyperinflation as a major factor in the government's collapse. The Nationalist military and the government's civilian employees were most impacted by hyperinflation which in turn prompted widespread corruption and pilfering. Little funding reached enlisted soldiers, who were typically malnourished and poorly equipped. Desertion was common.\nThe historian Rana Mitter writes that a lack of trust in the Nationalist government developed, as it was increasingly seen as \"corrupt, vindictive, and with no overall vision of what China under its rule should look like\". Chiang wrote in his diary in June 1948: \"After the fall of Kaifeng our conditions worsened and became more serious. I now realized that the main reason our nation has collapsed, time after time throughout our history, was not because of superior power used by our external enemies, but because of disintegration and rot from within.\"\nHistorian Odd Arne Westad says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-shek and also because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Communists targeted different groups, such as peasants, and brought them to their side. After 1945, the economy in the ROC areas collapsed because of hyperinflation and the failure of price controls by the ROC government and financial reforms; the Gold Yuan depreciated sharply in late 1948 and resulted in the ROC government losing the support of the cities' middle classes.\nUnited States Secretary of State Dean Acheson described the Nationalists as \"corrupt, reactionary, and inefficient\". He believed that the Nationalists had displayed both political inadequacy as well as \"the grossest incompetence ever experienced by any military command,\" and that the Communists \"did not create this condition\", but skillfully exploited the opportunity it provided.\nPopular support for Communists and cohesion.\nIn the meantime, the Communists continued their land reform programs, winning the support of the population in the countryside. This was a decisive factor in the Communists' success. Millions of peasants who obtained land through the movement joined the People's Liberation Army or assisted in its logistical networks. According to historian Brian DeMare, land redistribution was a critical factor because it linked the interests of peasants in the north and northeast to the Communists' success. Ultimately, the Communists obtained the greatest popular support of any insurgency in modern history.\nAn important advantage of the Communists was the \"extraordinary cohesion\" within its top leadership. This cohesion not only secured it from defections during difficult times but also facilitated \"communications and top level debates over tactics\". The charismatic style of leadership of Mao Zedong created a \"unity of purpose\" and a \"unity of command\" which the KMT lacked. Apart from that, the CCP had mastered the manipulation of local politics to their benefit; this was also derived from their propaganda skills that had also been decentralised successfully by portraying their opponents as \"enemies of all groups of Chinese\" and itself as \"defenders of the nation\" and people (given the backdrop of the war with Japan).\nInternational factors.\nAfter the Second Sino-Japanese War ended, the United States government provided economic and military support exclusively to the Nationalists. As the United States increased aid to the Nationalists in 1947 and 1948, the Communists incorporated United States involvement into its political discourse and framed the conflict not as one between two Chinese sides, but between the Communists and \"US imperialists and their puppets\".55 Mao contended that the United States had provided US$5.9 billion to the Nationalists from 1945 to 1949 \"to help Chiang Kai-shek slaughter several million Chinese\".55\nStrong American support for the Nationalists was hedged with the failure of the Marshall Mission, and then stopped completely mainly because of KMT corruption (such as the notorious Yangtze Development Corporation controlled by H. H. Kung and T. V. Soong's family) and KMT's military setback in Northeast China. Historians such as Jay Taylor, Robert Cowley, and Anne W. Carroll argue that the Nationalists' failure was largely caused by external reasons outside of the KMT's control, most notably the refusal of the Truman administration to support Chiang with the withdrawal of aid, the US armed embargo, the failed pursuit of a d\u00e9tente between the Nationalists and the communists, and the USSR's consistent support of the CCP in the Chinese Civil War. The better-trained Communist army's support from the USSR helped counter the American aid that the Nationalists received. Chen Yun said: \"They did their best to help us, we were backed by the Soviet Union and North Korea.\"\nAtrocities.\nDuring the war, both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants deliberately killed by both sides. \nNationalist atrocities.\nOver several years after the 1927 Shanghai massacre, the Kuomintang killed between 300,000 and one million people, primarily peasants, in anti-communist campaigns as part of the White Terror. During the White Terror, the Nationalists specifically targeted women with short hair who had not been subjected to foot binding, on the presumption that such \"non-traditional\" women were radicals. Nationalist forces cut off their breasts, shaved their heads, and displayed their mutilated bodies to intimidate the populace.\nTorture, rape, and collective punishment were common Nationalist practices during its counter-insurgency campaigns. The Nationalists uprooted and moved entire communities in an effort to more easily monitor Communist activities.\nFrom 1946 to 1949, the Nationalists arrested, tortured, and killed political dissidents via the Sino-American Cooperative Organization.\nCommunist atrocities.\nDuring the December 1930 Futian incident, the communists executed 2,000 to 3,000 members of the Futian battalion after its leaders had mutinied against Mao Zedong.\nBetween 1931 and 1934 in the Jiangxi\u2013Fujian Soviet, the communist authorities engaged in a widespread campaign of violence against civilians to ensure compliance with its policies and to stop defection to the advancing KMT, including mass executions, land confiscation and forced labor. According to Li Weihan, a high-ranking communist in Jiangxi at the time, in response to mass flight of civilians to KMT held areas, the local authorities would \"usually to send armed squads after those attempting to flee and kill them on the spot, producing numerous mass graves throughout the CSR [Chinese Soviet Republic in Jiangxi] that would later be uncovered by the KMT and its allies.\" Zhang Wentian, another high-ranking communist, reported that \"the policy of annihilating landlords as an exploiting class had degenerated into a massacre\".\nDuring the Siege of Changchun, the People's Liberation Army implemented a military blockade on the KMT-held city of Changchun and prevented civilians from leaving the city during the blockade; this blockade caused the starvation of tens to 150 thousand civilians. The PLA continued to use siege tactics throughout Northeast China.\nAt the outbreak of the Chinese Civil War in 1946, Mao Zedong began to push for a return to radical policies to mobilize China against the landlord class, but protected the rights of middle peasants and specified that rich peasants were not landlords. The 7 July Directive of 1946 set off eighteen months of fierce conflict in which all rich peasant and landlord property of all types was to be confiscated and redistributed to poor peasants. CCP work teams went quickly from village to village and divided the population into landlords, rich, middle, poor, and landless peasants. Because the work teams did not involve villagers in the process, however, rich and middle peasants quickly returned to power. The Outline Land Law of October 1947 increased the pressure. Those condemned as landlords were buried alive, dismembered, strangled and shot.\nIn response to the aforementioned land reform campaign, the Kuomintang helped establish the \"Huanxiang Tuan\" (), or Homecoming Legion, which was composed of landlords who sought the return of their redistributed land and property from peasants and CCP guerrillas, as well as forcibly conscripted peasants and communist POWs. The Homecoming legion conducted its guerrilla warfare campaign against CCP forces and purported collaborators up until the end of the civil war in 1949.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Commonly the term is used to refer to changes among the basic states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas, and in rare cases, plasma. A phase of a thermodynamic system and the states of matter have uniform physical properties. During a phase transition of a given medium, certain properties of the medium change as a result of the change of external conditions, such as temperature or pressure. This can be a discontinuous change; for example, a liquid may become gas upon heating to its boiling point, resulting in an abrupt change in volume. The identification of the external conditions at which a transformation occurs defines the phase transition point.\nTypes.\nStates of matter.\nPhase transitions commonly refer to when a substance transforms between one of the four states of matter to another. At the phase transition point for a substance, for instance the boiling point, the two phases involved - liquid and vapor, have identical free energies and therefore are equally likely to exist. Below the boiling point, the liquid is the more stable state of the two, whereas above the boiling point the gaseous form is the more stable. \nCommon transitions between the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of a single component, due to the effects of temperature and/or pressure are identified in the following table:\nFor a single component, the most stable phase at different temperatures and pressures can be shown on a phase diagram. Such a diagram usually depicts states in equilibrium. A phase transition usually occurs when the pressure or temperature changes and the system crosses from one region to another, like water turning from liquid to solid as soon as the temperature drops below the freezing point. In exception to the usual case, it is sometimes possible to change the state of a system diabatically (as opposed to adiabatically) in such a way that it can be brought past a phase transition point without undergoing a phase transition. The resulting state is metastable, i.e., less stable than the phase to which the transition would have occurred, but not unstable either. This occurs in superheating and supercooling, for example. Metastable states do not appear on usual phase diagrams.\nStructural.\nPhase transitions can also occur when a solid changes to a different structure without changing its chemical makeup. In elements, this is known as allotropy, whereas in compounds it is known as polymorphism. The change from one crystal structure to another, from a crystalline solid to an amorphous solid, or from one amorphous structure to another (polyamorphs) are all examples of solid to solid phase transitions.\nThe martensitic transformation occurs as one of the many phase transformations in carbon steel and stands as a model for displacive phase transformations. Order-disorder transitions such as in alpha-titanium aluminides. As with states of matter, there is also a metastable to equilibrium phase transformation for structural phase transitions. A metastable polymorph which forms rapidly due to lower surface energy will transform to an equilibrium phase given sufficient thermal input to overcome an energetic barrier.\nMany dynamic, or soft, Microporous materials exhibit structural phase transitions between closed and open forms. Metal\u2013organic frameworks, in particular, have been extensively studied for this behavior. The phase landscape can be more complex, with intermediate phases discovered. Further examples show that guest molecules can stabilize specific phases, resulting in crystal configurations that depend on the composition of the surrounding atmosphere.\nMagnetic.\nPhase transitions can also describe the change between different kinds of magnetic ordering. The most well-known is the transition between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases of magnetic materials, which occurs at what is called the Curie point. Another example is the transition between differently ordered, commensurate or incommensurate, magnetic structures, such as in cerium antimonide. A simplified but highly useful model of magnetic phase transitions is provided by the Ising model.\nMixtures.\nPhase transitions involving solutions and mixtures are more complicated than transitions involving a single compound. While chemically pure compounds exhibit a single temperature melting point between solid and liquid phases, mixtures can either have a single melting point, known as congruent melting, or they have different liquidus and solidus temperatures resulting in a temperature span where solid and liquid coexist in equilibrium. This is often the case in solid solutions, where the two components are isostructural.\nThere are also a number of phase transitions involving three phases: a eutectic transformation, in which a two-component single-phase liquid is cooled and transforms into two solid phases. The same process, but beginning with a solid instead of a liquid is called a eutectoid transformation. A peritectic transformation, in which a two-component single-phase solid is heated and transforms into a solid phase and a liquid phase. A peritectoid reaction is a peritectoid reaction, except involving only solid phases. A monotectic reaction consists of change from a liquid and to a combination of a solid and a second liquid, where the two liquids display a miscibility gap.\nSeparation into multiple phases can occur via spinodal decomposition, in which a single phase is cooled and separates into two different compositions.\nNon-equilibrium mixtures can occur, such as in supersaturation.\nOther examples.\nOther phase changes include:\nPhase transitions occur when the thermodynamic free energy of a system is non-analytic for some choice of thermodynamic variables (cf. phases). This condition generally stems from the interactions of a large number of particles in a system, and does not appear in systems that are small. Phase transitions can occur for non-thermodynamic systems, where temperature is not a parameter. Examples include: quantum phase transitions, dynamic phase transitions, and topological (structural) phase transitions. In these types of systems other parameters take the place of temperature. For instance, connection probability replaces temperature for percolating networks.\nClassifications.\nEhrenfest classification.\nPaul Ehrenfest classified phase transitions based on the behavior of the thermodynamic free energy as a function of other thermodynamic variables. Under this scheme, phase transitions were labeled by the lowest derivative of the free energy that is discontinuous at the transition. \"First-order phase transitions\" exhibit a discontinuity in the first derivative of the free energy with respect to some thermodynamic variable. The various solid/liquid/gas transitions are classified as first-order transitions because they involve a discontinuous change in density, which is the (inverse of the) first derivative of the free energy with respect to pressure. \"Second-order phase transitions\" are continuous in the first derivative (the order parameter, which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the external field, is continuous across the transition) but exhibit discontinuity in a second derivative of the free energy. These include the ferromagnetic phase transition in materials such as iron, where the magnetization, which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the applied magnetic field strength, increases continuously from zero as the temperature is lowered below the Curie temperature. The magnetic susceptibility, the second derivative of the free energy with the field, changes discontinuously. Under the Ehrenfest classification scheme, there could in principle be third, fourth, and higher-order phase transitions. For example, the Gross\u2013Witten\u2013Wadia phase transition in 2-d lattice quantum chromodynamics is a third-order phase transition, and the Tracy\u2013Widom distribution can be interpreted as a third-order transition. The Curie points of many ferromagnetics is also a third-order transition, as shown by their specific heat having a sudden change in slope.\nIn practice, only the first- and second-order phase transitions are typically observed. The second-order phase transition was for a while controversial, as it seems to require two sheets of the Gibbs free energy to osculate exactly, which is so unlikely as to never occur in practice. Cornelis Gorter replied the criticism by pointing out that the Gibbs free energy surface might have two sheets on one side, but only one sheet on the other side, creating a forked appearance. ( pp. 146--150)\nThe Ehrenfest classification implicitly allows for continuous phase transformations, where the bonding character of a material changes, but there is no discontinuity in any free energy derivative. An example of this occurs at the supercritical liquid\u2013gas boundaries.\nThe first example of a phase transition which did not fit into the Ehrenfest classification was the exact solution of the Ising model, discovered in 1944 by Lars Onsager. The exact specific heat differed from the earlier mean-field approximations, which had predicted that it has a simple discontinuity at critical temperature. Instead, the exact specific heat had a logarithmic divergence at the critical temperature. In the following decades, the Ehrenfest classification was replaced by a simplified classification scheme that is able to incorporate such transitions.\nModern classifications.\nIn the modern classification scheme, phase transitions are divided into two broad categories, named similarly to the Ehrenfest classes:\nFirst-order phase transitions are those that involve a latent heat. During such a transition, a system either absorbs or releases a fixed (and typically large) amount of energy per volume. During this process, the temperature of the system will stay constant as heat is added: the system is in a \"mixed-phase regime\" in which some parts of the system have completed the transition and others have not. \nFamiliar examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water (the water does not instantly turn into vapor, but forms a turbulent mixture of liquid water and vapor bubbles). Yoseph Imry and Michael Wortis showed that quenched disorder can broaden a first-order transition. That is, the transformation is completed over a finite range of temperatures, but phenomena like supercooling and superheating survive and hysteresis is observed on thermal cycling.\ns are also called \"continuous phase transitions\". They are characterized by a divergent susceptibility, an infinite correlation length, and a power law decay of correlations near criticality. Examples of second-order phase transitions are the ferromagnetic transition, superconducting transition (for a Type-I superconductor the phase transition is second-order at zero external field and for a Type-II superconductor the phase transition is second-order for both normal-state\u2013mixed-state and mixed-state\u2013superconducting-state transitions) and the superfluid transition. In contrast to viscosity, thermal expansion and heat capacity of amorphous materials show a relatively sudden change at the glass transition temperature which enables accurate detection using differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Lev Landau gave a phenomenological theory of second-order phase transitions.\nApart from isolated, simple phase transitions, there exist transition lines as well as multicritical points, when varying external parameters like the magnetic field or composition.\nSeveral transitions are known as \"infinite-order phase transitions\".\nThey are continuous but break no symmetries. The most famous example is the Kosterlitz\u2013Thouless transition in the two-dimensional XY model. Many quantum phase transitions, e.g., in two-dimensional electron gases, belong to this class.\nThe liquid\u2013glass transition is observed in many polymers and other liquids that can be supercooled far below the melting point of the crystalline phase. This is atypical in several respects. It is not a transition between thermodynamic ground states: it is widely believed that the true ground state is always crystalline. Glass is a \"quenched disorder\" state, and its entropy, density, and so on, depend on the thermal history. Therefore, the glass transition is primarily a dynamic phenomenon: on cooling a liquid, internal degrees of freedom successively fall out of equilibrium. Some theoretical methods predict an underlying phase transition in the hypothetical limit of infinitely long relaxation times. No direct experimental evidence supports the existence of these transitions.\nCharacteristic properties.\nPhase coexistence.\nA disorder-broadened first-order transition occurs over a finite range of temperatures where the fraction of the low-temperature equilibrium phase grows from zero to one (100%) as the temperature is lowered. This continuous variation of the coexisting fractions with temperature raised interesting possibilities. On cooling, some liquids vitrify into a glass rather than transform to the equilibrium crystal phase. This happens if the cooling rate is faster than a critical cooling rate, and is attributed to the molecular motions becoming so slow that the molecules cannot rearrange into the crystal positions. This slowing down happens below a glass-formation temperature \"T\"g, which may depend on the applied pressure. If the first-order freezing transition occurs over a range of temperatures, and \"T\"g falls within this range, then there is an interesting possibility that the transition is arrested when it is partial and incomplete. Extending these ideas to first-order magnetic transitions being arrested at low temperatures, resulted in the observation of incomplete magnetic transitions, with two magnetic phases coexisting, down to the lowest temperature. First reported in the case of a ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic transition, such persistent phase coexistence has now been reported across a variety of first-order magnetic transitions. These include colossal-magnetoresistance manganite materials, magnetocaloric materials, magnetic shape memory materials, and other materials.\nThe interesting feature of these observations of \"T\"g falling within the temperature range over which the transition occurs is that the first-order magnetic transition is influenced by magnetic field, just like the structural transition is influenced by pressure. The relative ease with which magnetic fields can be controlled, in contrast to pressure, raises the possibility that one can study the interplay between \"T\"g and \"T\"c in an exhaustive way. Phase coexistence across first-order magnetic transitions will then enable the resolution of outstanding issues in understanding glasses.\nCritical points.\nIn any system containing liquid and gaseous phases, there exists a special combination of pressure and temperature, known as the critical point, at which the transition between liquid and gas becomes a second-order transition. Near the critical point, the fluid is sufficiently hot and compressed that the distinction between the liquid and gaseous phases is almost non-existent. This is associated with the phenomenon of critical opalescence, a milky appearance of the liquid due to density fluctuations at all possible wavelengths (including those of visible light).\nSymmetry.\nPhase transitions often involve a symmetry breaking process. For instance, the cooling of a fluid into a crystalline solid breaks continuous translation symmetry: each point in the fluid has the same properties, but each point in a crystal does not have the same properties (unless the points are chosen from the lattice points of the crystal lattice). Typically, the high-temperature phase contains more symmetries than the low-temperature phase due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, with the exception of certain accidental symmetries (e.g. the formation of heavy virtual particles, which only occurs at low temperatures).\nOrder parameters.\nAn order parameter is a measure of the degree of order across the boundaries in a phase transition system; it normally ranges between zero in one phase (usually above the critical point) and nonzero in the other. At the critical point, the order parameter susceptibility will usually diverge.\nAn example of an order parameter is the net magnetization in a ferromagnetic system undergoing a phase transition. For liquid/gas transitions, the order parameter is the difference of the densities.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, order parameters arise from symmetry breaking. When this happens, one needs to introduce one or more extra variables to describe the state of the system. For example, in the ferromagnetic phase, one must provide the net magnetization, whose direction was spontaneously chosen when the system cooled below the Curie point. However, note that order parameters can also be defined for non-symmetry-breaking transitions.\nSome phase transitions, such as superconducting and ferromagnetic, can have order parameters for more than one degree of freedom. In such phases, the order parameter may take the form of a complex number, a vector, or even a tensor, the magnitude of which goes to zero at the phase transition.\nThere also exist dual descriptions of phase transitions in terms of disorder parameters. These indicate the presence of line-like excitations such as vortex- or defect lines.\nRelevance in cosmology.\nSymmetry-breaking phase transitions play an important role in cosmology. As the universe expanded and cooled, the vacuum underwent a series of symmetry-breaking phase transitions. For example, the electroweak transition broke the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) symmetry of the electroweak field into the U(1) symmetry of the present-day electromagnetic field. This transition is important to explain the asymmetry between the amount of matter and antimatter in the present-day universe, according to electroweak baryogenesis theory.\nProgressive phase transitions in an expanding universe are implicated in the development of order in the universe, as is illustrated by the work of Eric Chaisson and David Layzer.\nSee also relational order theories and order and disorder.\nCritical exponents and universality classes.\nContinuous phase transitions are easier to study than first-order transitions due to the absence of latent heat, and they have been discovered to have many interesting properties. The phenomena associated with continuous phase transitions are called critical phenomena, due to their association with critical points.\nContinuous phase transitions can be characterized by parameters known as critical exponents. The most important one is perhaps the exponent describing the divergence of the thermal correlation length by approaching the transition. For instance, let us examine the behavior of the heat capacity near such a transition. We vary the temperature \"T\" of the system while keeping all the other thermodynamic variables fixed and find that the transition occurs at some critical temperature \"T\"c. When \"T\" is near \"T\"c, the heat capacity \"C\" typically has a power law behavior:\n formula_1\nThe heat capacity of amorphous materials has such a behaviour near the glass transition temperature where the universal critical exponent \"\u03b1\" = 0.59 A similar behavior, but with the exponent \"\u03bd\" instead of \"\u03b1\", applies for the correlation length.\nThe critical exponents are not necessarily the same above and below the critical temperature. When a continuous symmetry is explicitly broken down to a discrete symmetry by irrelevant (in the renormalization group sense) anisotropies, then some exponents (such as formula_2, the exponent of the susceptibility) are not identical.\nFor formula_3, the heat capacity remains differentiable at the transition temperature, although discontinuities appear at higher-order derivatives.\nFor formula_4, the heat capacity has a \"kink\" at the transition temperature. This is the behavior of liquid helium at the lambda transition from a normal state to the superfluid state, for which experiments have found \"\u03b1\" = \u22120.013\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003.\nAt least one experiment was performed in the zero-gravity conditions of an orbiting satellite to minimize pressure differences in the sample. This experimental value of \u03b1 agrees with theoretical predictions based on variational perturbation theory.\nFor 0 &lt; \"\u03b1\" &lt; 1, the heat capacity diverges at the transition temperature (though, since \"\u03b1\" &lt; 1, the enthalpy stays finite). An example of such behavior is the 3D ferromagnetic phase transition. In the three-dimensional Ising model for uniaxial magnets, detailed theoretical studies have yielded the exponent \"\u03b1\" \u2248 +0.110.\nSome model systems do not obey a power-law behavior. For example, mean field theory predicts a finite discontinuity of the heat capacity at the transition temperature, and the two-dimensional Ising model has a logarithmic divergence. However, these systems are limiting cases and an exception to the rule. Real phase transitions exhibit power-law behavior.\nSeveral other critical exponents, \"\u03b2\", \"\u03b3\", \"\u03b4\", \"\u03bd\", and \"\u03b7\", are defined, examining the power law behavior of a measurable physical quantity near the phase transition. Exponents are related by scaling relations, such as\n formula_5\nIt can be shown that there are only two independent exponents, e.g. \"\u03bd\" and \"\u03b7\".\nIt is a remarkable fact that phase transitions arising in different systems often possess the same set of critical exponents. This phenomenon is known as \"universality\". For example, the critical exponents at the liquid\u2013gas critical point have been found to be independent of the chemical composition of the fluid.\nMore impressively, but understandably from above, they are an exact match for the critical exponents of the ferromagnetic phase transition in uniaxial magnets. Such systems are said to be in the same universality class. Universality is a prediction of the renormalization group theory of phase transitions, which states that the thermodynamic properties of a system near a phase transition depend only on a small number of features, such as dimensionality and symmetry, and are insensitive to the underlying microscopic properties of the system. Again, the divergence of the correlation length is the essential point.\nCritical phenomena.\nThere are also other critical phenomena; e.g., besides \"static functions\" there is also \"critical dynamics\". As a consequence, at a phase transition one may observe \"critical slowing down\" or \"speeding up\". Connected to the previous phenomenon is also the phenomenon of \"enhanced fluctuations\" before the phase transition, as a consequence of lower degree of stability of the initial phase of the system. The large \"static universality classes\" of a continuous phase transition split into smaller \"dynamic universality\" classes. In addition to the critical exponents, there are also universal relations for certain static or dynamic functions of the magnetic fields and temperature differences from the critical value.\nExperimental.\nA variety of methods are applied for studying the various effects. Selected examples are:\nIn other systems.\nPhase transitions in biology.\nPhase transitions play many important roles in biological systems. Examples include the lipid bilayer formation, the coil-globule transition in the process of protein folding and DNA melting, liquid crystal-like transitions in the process of DNA condensation, cooperative ligand binding to DNA and proteins with the character of phase transition or the change in the process of genetic expression at the onset of eukaryotes, marked by an algorithmic phase transition.\nIn \"biological membranes\", gel to liquid crystalline phase transitions play a critical role in physiological functioning of biomembranes. In gel phase, due to low fluidity of membrane lipid fatty-acyl chains, membrane proteins have restricted movement and thus are restrained in exercise of their physiological role. Plants depend critically on photosynthesis by chloroplast thylakoid membranes which are exposed cold environmental temperatures. Thylakoid membranes retain innate fluidity even at relatively low temperatures because of high degree of fatty-acyl disorder allowed by their high content of linolenic acid, 18-carbon chain with 3-double bonds. Gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature of biological membranes can be determined by many techniques including calorimetry, fluorescence, spin label electron paramagnetic resonance and NMR by recording measurements of the concerned parameter by at series of sample temperatures. A simple method for its determination from 13-C NMR line intensities has also been proposed.\nIt has been proposed that some biological systems might lie near critical points. Examples include neural networks in the salamander retina, bird flocks, gene expression networks in Drosophila, and protein folding. However, it is not clear whether or not alternative reasons could explain some of the phenomena supporting arguments for criticality. It has also been suggested that biological organisms share two key properties of phase transitions: the change of macroscopic behavior and the coherence of a system at a critical point. Phase transitions are prominent feature of motor behavior in biological systems. Spontaneous gait transitions, as well as fatigue-induced motor task disengagements, show typical critical behavior as an intimation of the sudden qualitative change of the previously stable motor behavioral pattern.\nThe characteristic feature of second order phase transitions is the appearance of fractals in some scale-free properties. It has long been known that protein globules are shaped by interactions with water. There are 20 amino acids that form side groups on protein peptide chains range from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, causing the former to lie near the globular surface, while the latter lie closer to the globular center. Twenty fractals were discovered in solvent associated surface areas of &gt; 5000 protein segments. The existence of these fractals proves that proteins function near critical points of second-order phase transitions. \nIn groups of organisms in stress (when approaching critical transitions), correlations tend to increase, while at the same time, fluctuations also increase. This effect is supported by many experiments and observations of groups of people, mice, trees, and grassy plants.\nPhase transitions in social systems.\nPhase transitions have been hypothesised to occur in social systems viewed as dynamical systems. A hypothesis proposed in the 1990s and 2000s in the context of peace and armed conflict is that when a conflict that is non-violent shifts to a phase of armed conflict, this is a phase transition from latent to manifest phases within the dynamical system.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

It now exists only in ruins, located about south of Baghdad, Iraq. Many scholars have identified Etemenanki as the ziggurat for the biblical account of the Tower of Babel.\nConstruction.\nIt is unclear when Etemenanki was originally constructed. Andrew R. George says that it was constructed sometime between the 14th and the 9th century BCE. He argues as follows:\nThe reference to a ziggurrat at Babylon in the Creation Epic (En\u00fbma Eli\u0161\u00b7 VI 63: George 1992: 301\u20132) is more solid evidence, ... for a Middle Assyrian piece of this poem survives to prove the long-held theory that it existed already in the second millennium BC. There is no reason to doubt that this ziqqurrat, described as \"ziqqurrat aps\u00ee elite\", \"the upper ziqqurrat of the Aps\u00fb\", was [Etemenanki].\nBabylon was destroyed in 689 BCE by Sennacherib, who claims to have destroyed the Etemenanki. It took 88 years to restore the city; work was started by the Assyrian king Esarhaddon, and continued under Nabopolassar followed by his son Nebuchadnezzar II who rebuilt the ziggurat. The city's central feature was the temple of Marduk (Esagila), with which the Etemenanki ziggurat was associated.\nFenoll\u00f3s et al. note that, \"The 'Tower of Babel' was not built in a single moment, but rather was the result of a complex history of successive constructions, destruction and reconstruction. Its origin dates back to the reign of Hammurabi and continues to this day with its inevitable and definitive destruction.\" (Translated from the Italian). The \"Tower\" as discussed in ancient sources refers to the monument as it appeared in the Neo-Babylonian period.\nDescriptions.\nA Neo-Babylonian royal inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II on a stele from Babylon, claimed to have been found in the 1917 excavation by Robert Koldewey, and of uncertain authenticity, reads: \"Etemenanki Zikkurat Babibli [Ziggurat of Babylon] I made it, the wonder of the people of the world, I raised its top to heaven, made doors for the gates, and I covered it with bitumen and bricks.\" The building is depicted in shallow relief, showing its high first stages with paired flights of steps, five further stepped stages and the temple that surmounted the structure. A floor plan is also shown, depicting the buttressed outer walls and the inner chambers surrounding the central \"cella\".\nFoundation cylinders with inscriptions from Nabopolassar were found in the 1880s, two survive, one of which reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At that time my lord Marduk told me in regard to E-temen-anki, the ziqqurrat of Babylon, which before my day was (already) very weak and badly buckled, to ground its bottom on the breast of the netherworld, to make its top vie with the heavens. I fashioned mattocks, spades and brick-moulds from ivory, ebony, and musukkannu-wood, and set them in the hands of a vast workforce levied from my land. I had them shape mud bricks without number and mould-baked bricks like countless raindrops. I had the River Arahtu bear asphalt and bitumen like a mighty flood. Through the sagacity of Ea, through the intelligence of Marduk, through the wisdom of Nab\u00fb and Nissaba, by means of the vast mind that the god who created me let me possess, I deliberated with my great intellect, I commissioned the wisest experts and the surveyor established the dimensions with the twelve-cubit rule. The master-builders drew taut the measuring cords, they determined the limits. I sought confirmation by consulting Samas, Adad and Marduk and, whenever my mind deliberated (and) I pondered (unsure of) the dimensions, the great gods made (the truth) known to me by the procedure of (oracular) confirmation. Through the craft of exorcism, the wisdom of Ea and Marduk, I purified that place and made firm its foundation platform on its ancient base. In its foundations I laid out gold, silver, gemstones from mountain and sea. Under the brickwork, I set heaps of shining \"sapsu\", sweet-scented oil, aromatics and red earth. I fashioned representations of my royal likeness bearing a soil-basket and positioned (them) variously in the foundation platform. I bowed my neck to my lord Marduk. I rolled up my garment, my kingly robe, and carried on my head bricks and earth (i.e. mud bricks). I had soil-baskets made of gold and silver and made Nebuchadnezzar, my firstborn son, beloved of my heart, carry alongside my workmen earth mixed with wine, oil and resin-chips. I made Nab\u00fbsumilisir, his brother, a boy, issue of my body, my darling younger son, take up mattock and spade. I burdened him with a soil-basket of gold and silver and bestowed him on my lord Marduk as a gift.I constructed the building, the replica of E-sarra, in joy and jubilation and raised its top as high as a mountain. For my lord Marduk I made it an object fitting for wonder, just as it was in former times.\nIn 2003 scholars discovered in the Sch\u00f8yen Collection the oldest known representation of the Etemenanki. Carved on a black stone, the \"Tower of Babel Stele\", as it is known, dates to 604\u2013562 BCE, the time of Nebuchadnezzar II.\nThe Etemenanki is described in a cuneiform tablet from Uruk from 229 BCE, a copy of an older text (now in the Louvre, Paris and referred to as the \"Esagila\" tablet). Translated in 1876 by Assyriologist George Smith, it gives the height of the tower as seven stocks (91 meters) with a square base of 91 meters on each side. This mudbrick structure was confirmed by excavations conducted by Robert Koldewey after 1913. Large stairs were discovered at the south side of the building, where a triple gate connected it with the Esagila. A larger gate to the east connected the Etemenanki with the sacred procession road (now reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum, Berlin).\nUntil the first translation of the \"Esagila\" tablet, details of Babylon's ziggurat were known only from the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote in the mid-5th century BCE:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The center of each division of the town was occupied by a fortress. In the one stood the palace of the kings, surrounded by a wall of great strength and size: in the other was the sacred precinct of Jupiter [Zeus] Belus, a square enclosure two furlongs [402 m] each way, with gates of solid brass; which was also remaining in my time. In the middle of the precinct there was a tower of solid masonry, a furlong [201 m] in length and breadth, upon which was raised a second tower, and on that a third, and so on up to eight. The ascent to the top is on the outside, by a path which winds round all the towers. When one is about half-way up, one finds a resting-place and seats, where persons can sit for some time on their way to the summit. On the topmost tower there is a spacious temple, and inside the temple stands a couch of unusual size, richly adorned, with a golden table by its side. There is no statue of any kind set up in the place, nor is the chamber occupied of nights by any one but a single native woman, who, as the Chaldeans [i.e. the Babylonians], the priests of this god, affirm, is chosen for himself by the deity out of all the women of the land.\nThis \"Tower of Jupiter Belus\" is believed to refer to the Akkadian god Bel, whose name has been Hellenised by Herodotus to \"Zeus Belus\". It is likely that it corresponds to Etemenanki. Herodotus does not say that he visited Babylon or the ziggurat, however; the account contains multiple inaccuracies and is most likely second hand.\nFinal demolition.\nIn 331 BCE, Alexander the Great captured Babylon and ordered repairs to the Etemenanki. When Alexander returned to the ancient city in 323 BCE, he noted that no progress had been made, and ordered his army to demolish the entire building in order to prepare a final rebuilding. His death, however, prevented the reconstruction. The Babylonian Chronicles and Astronomical Diaries record several attempts to rebuild the Etemenanki, which were always preceded by removing the last debris of the original ziggurat. The \"Ruin of Esagila Chronicle\" mentions that the Seleucid crown prince Antiochus I decided to rebuild it and made a sacrifice in preparation. However, while there, he stumbled on the rubble and fell. He then angrily ordered his elephant drivers to destroy the last of the remains. There are no later references to the Etemenanki from antiquity.\nModern hypotheses regarding height.\nModern scholars dispute the claim by the ancient Babylonian source (the \"Esagila\" tablet) that the Etemenanki was 91 meters tall. \"[The modern] interpretation of Esagil's text raises a serious technical problem: the excessive height of the first two terraces of the ziggurat and the total height of the building defy the laws of statics and compressive strength of a material such as raw earth brick.\" (Translated from the Italian). Even allowing variation in the design of a six-level terraced structure, at that height, the compression stress on the structure would be somewhere around two to three times as much as comparable structures of the same time period. Fenoll\u00f3s et al. propose that, assuming the structure did indeed use a six-level terrace design as depicted in the Tower of Babel stele, the ziggurat was probably closer to 54 meters tall. The temple at the top contributed another 12 meters in height, for a total height of 66 meters.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the Portugal Pack of the video game \"Civilization VI\", Etemenanki was introduced as one of the wonders in the game.\nIn the Lucasarts PC video game \"Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine\", Etemenanki is a key location, eventually revealed to have been both the biblical Tower of Babel and a temple to the god Marduk.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Patients with FDIS intentionally falsify or induce signs and symptoms of illness, trauma, or abuse to assume this role. These actions are performed consciously, though the patient may be unaware of their motivations. There are several risk factors and signs associated with this illness and treatment is usually in the form of psychotherapy but may depend on the specific situation, which is further discussed below. Diagnosis is usually determined by meeting specific DSM-5 criteria after ruling out true illness as described below.\nFactitious disorder imposed on self is related to factitious disorder imposed on another, the abuse of another person in order to seek attention or sympathy for the abuser. This is \"Munchausen by proxy\", and the drive to create symptoms for the victim can result in unnecessary and costly diagnostic or corrective procedures. Other similar and often confused syndromes and diagnoses are discussed in the \"Related Diagnoses\" section.\nHistory and terminology.\nThat patients can exaggerate or inflict symptoms on themselves has been recognized since antiquity, with the second century manuscript attributed to Galen titled \"On Feigned Diseases and the Detection of Them\". In 1843, the Scots physician Hector Gavin invented the term \"factitious disease\" to describe persons who faked medical symptoms for sympathy, attention or \"some inexplicable cause\". In the 1930s, the psychiatrist Karl Menninger noted some patients compulsively insisted on medically unnecessary surgeries, often seeking out a physician with a powerful or dynamic personality.\nIn 1951, Richard Asher coined \"Munchausen syndrome\" for a pattern of self-harm where individuals fabricated histories, signs, and symptoms of illness. The name alludes to Baron Munchausen, a fictional character who tells many fantastic and impossible stories about himself. Asher's article was published in \"The Lancet\" in February 1951. The name sparked some controversy, with medical authorities debating the appropriateness of the name for about fifty years. While Asher was praised for bringing cases of factitious disorder to light, participants in the debate objected variously that a literary allusion was inappropriate given the seriousness of the disease; and that the name's connection to works of humor and fantasy, and to the essentially ridiculous character of the fictional Baron Munchausen, was disrespectful to patients with the disorder. Some healthcare providers avoid this term because it downplays the complexity of the illness and devalues the patient experience. \nThe term \"factitious disorder imposed on self\" provides a more neutral description of the mental disorder; however, both terms may still be used interchangeably in practice.\nRisk factors.\nThe exact cause of this illness is unknown due to limited research but is likely the result of multiple psychosocial factors. Specific risk factors have been associated with developing FDIS, specifically a history of childhood trauma, abandonment, having a serious childhood illness, and certain personality disorders. Patients are more likely to be female, middle aged, and work in the healthcare industry. Individuals with this disorder may also have a history of recurrent hospitalizations and frequent visits to multiple different physicians (i.e. doctor shopping). They are also more likely to have underlying depression, though it is unclear if it is a cause or symptom of this illness. Some researchers suggest other various psychiatric disorders may coincide, namely Borderline Personality Disorder. The comorbidity of these psychiatric disorders with FDIS can be termed a Tripolar Syndrome.\nSigns and symptoms.\nIn factitious disorder imposed on self, the affected person exaggerates or creates physical or psychological symptoms of illnesses in themselves to gain examination, treatment, attention, sympathy or comfort from medical personnel. Because these symptoms can vary depending on how patients induce these symptoms, there is no consistent symptom specific for this illness. However, there are several common themes that may raise suspicion for FDIS. Some of these common themes include:\nCommon examples of commonly induced physical symptoms include intentionally infecting a wound with debris or unsanitary material, taking laxatives to induce diarrhea, or ingesting thyroid hormone replacement medication to simulate a hyperactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism.\nDiagnosis.\nDue to the behaviors involved, diagnosing factitious disorder is very difficult. Because induced symptoms may mimic those of a real disease or disorder, physicians must first rule out genuine disease. Therefore, FDIS is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. To rule out genuine illness, lab tests may be required, including complete blood count (CBC), urine toxicology, drug tests, blood cultures to rule out infection, coagulation tests, assays for thyroid function, or DNA typing, depending on the mimicked disease. In some cases CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging, psychological testing, electroencephalography, or electrocardiography may be required. A more extensive list of how organic illness is differentiated from FDIS is provided below.\nIf the healthcare provider finds no physical reason for the symptoms, they may refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist (mental health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses). Psychiatrists and psychologists use thorough history, physical examinations, laboratory tests, imagery, and psychological testing to evaluate a person for physical and mental conditions and to distinguish between feigned versus real illness. Once the person's history has been thoroughly evaluated, diagnosing factitious disorder imposed on self requires a clinical assessment, typically performed by a psychiatrist.\nFor a person to be diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on self, they must meet the following criteria:\nCommon manifestations.\nThere are common methods for inducing certain symptoms and mimicking specific diseases. As mentioned earlier, it is important to first rule out true disease. Oftentimes this requires multiple lab tests as a form of differential diagnosis, especially when the disease is mimicked closely in patients with existing medical knowledge.Physicians usually must have a high suspicion for FDIS to pursue it as a likely diagnosis based on abnormal patient behaviors and medical history. Some examples of these are listed in the table below, along with how to differentiate them from real versus mimicked disease using medical laboratory tests or imaging.\nMunchausen by Internet.\nMunchausen by internet is a term describing the pattern of behavior in factitious disorder imposed on self, wherein those affected feign illnesses in online venues to gain sympathy from online supporters. It has been described in medical literature as a manifestation of factitious disorder imposed on self. Reports of users who deceive internet forum participants by portraying themselves as gravely ill or as victims of violence first appeared in the 1990s due to the relative newness of Internet communications. The specific internet pattern was named \"M\u00fcnchausen by internet\" in 1998 by psychiatrist Marc Feldman. \"New Zealand PC World Magazine\" called Munchausen by Internet \"cybermunch\", and those who posed online \"cybermunchers\". More recently, online forums such as snark subreddits have labelled these individuals as \"illness fakers\" or \"munchies\".\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of TikTok users, primarily teenage girls, began to present with tics and vocalizations similar to those associated with Tourette syndrome. However, lack of congruent family history and other diagnostic criteria led some experts to interpret this phenomenon as mass psychogenic illness facilitated by social media. Mass psychogenic illness is described as requiring physical proximity to spread, hence technologically-facilitated conversion is differentiated under the label \"Mass Social Media-Induced Illness\" (MSMI). Other conditions feigned as a result of MSMI include autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, dissociative identity disorder, and bipolar disorders.\nTreatment.\nWhen confronted with this diagnosis, patients often refuse to accept it and will continue their behaviors seeking healthcare at different institutions or physicians. Those who accept the diagnosis benefit most from psychotherapy delivered by a skilled therapist or psychiatrist. In doing so, patients can learn the underlying subconscious motivations that drive their conscious behaviors in order to develop a sense of awareness that prevents them from continuing these harmful behaviors. If a person is considered to be at risk of harming themself or others, psychiatric hospitalization may be initiated.\nSpecific forms of therapy may be tailored to underlying personality disorders contributing to their behaviors. For example, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) can be used to treat borderline personality disorder. Medications may be necessary to treat an underlying mood disorder or anxiety disorder, as many patients with this disorder may have underlying depression. Patients with underlying depression and/or anxiety are typically responsive to antidepressants with or without cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of psychotherapy.\nRelated diagnoses.\nFactitious disorder imposed on self can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from several related diagnoses, but they differ in their motivational gains and control over symptoms. \"Gain\" is a Freudian psychoanalytic term that is used to describe the psychological benefits that drive certain illnesses and their behaviors. A primary gain refers to internal benefits from a symptom or illness, like feeling a decrease in emotional or psychological stress. A secondary gain refers to the external benefits from a symptom or illness, like receiving financial benefits or avoiding a stressful activity.\nFactitious disorder is distinct from malingering in that people with factitious disorder do not fabricate symptoms for material gain such as financial compensation, absence from work, or access to drugs. Somatiform disorders include a range of illnesses where physical symptoms result from psychological stressors. Perhaps the most common subtype, Functional Neurologic Disorder is characterized by psychological distress resulting from neurologic symptoms (e.g., paralysis, seizures, loss of vision) that typically coincide with periods of psychological stress and are not due to an underlying neurologic condition. Below is a table outlining the differences between these related diagnoses.\nFactitious disorder imposed on another, also referred to as Munchausen's by proxy, occurs when an individual induces symptoms or feigns illness in someone else to receive some form of psychological satisfaction for themselves. This has been documented in the parent or guardian of a child or the owner of a pet animal. The adult ensures that their child will experience some medical condition, therefore compelling the child to suffer through treatments and spend a significant portion during youth in hospitals. Furthermore, a disease may actually be initiated in the child by the parent or guardian. This condition is considered distinct from Munchausen syndrome. There is growing consensus in the pediatric community that this disorder should be renamed \"medical abuse\" to highlight the harm caused by the deception and to make it less likely that the sufferer can use a psychiatric defense when harm is done.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, the computation of polynomial greatest common divisors is systematically used for the simplification of expressions involving fractions.\nThis large amount of required computer capabilities explains the small number of general-purpose computer algebra systems. Significant systems include Axiom, GAP, Maxima, Magma, Maple, Mathematica, SageMath, and SymPy.\nHistory.\nIn the 1950s, while computers were mainly used for numerical computations, there were some research projects into using them for symbolic manipulation. Computer algebra systems began to appear in the 1960s and evolved out of two quite different sources\u2014the requirements of theoretical physicists and research into artificial intelligence.\nA prime example for the first development was the pioneering work conducted by the later Nobel Prize laureate in physics Martinus Veltman, who designed a program for symbolic mathematics, especially high-energy physics, called Schoonschip (Dutch for \"clean ship\") in 1963. Other early systems include FORMAC.\nUsing Lisp as the programming basis, Carl Engelman created MATHLAB in 1964 at MITRE within an artificial-intelligence research environment. Later MATHLAB was made available to users on PDP-6 and PDP-10 systems running TOPS-10 or TENEX in universities. Today it can still be used on SIMH emulations of the PDP-10. MATHLAB (\"mathematical laboratory\") should not be confused with MATLAB (\"matrix laboratory\"), which is a system for numerical computation built 15 years later at the University of New Mexico.\nIn 1987, Hewlett-Packard introduced the first hand-held calculator CAS with the HP-28 series. Other early handheld calculators with symbolic algebra capabilities included the Texas Instruments TI-89 series and TI-92 calculator, and the Casio CFX-9970G.\nThe first popular computer algebra systems were muMATH, Reduce, Derive (based on muMATH), and Macsyma; a copyleft version of Macsyma is called Maxima. Reduce became free software in 2008. Commercial systems include Mathematica and Maple, which are commonly used by research mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. Freely available alternatives include SageMath (which can act as a front-end to several other free and nonfree CAS). Other significant systems include Axiom, GAP, Maxima and Magma.\nThe movement to web-based applications in the early 2000s saw the release of WolframAlpha, an online search engine and CAS which includes the capabilities of Mathematica.\nMore recently, computer algebra systems have been implemented using artificial neural networks.\nSymbolic manipulations.\nThe symbolic manipulations supported typically include:\nIn the above, the word \"some\" indicates that the operation cannot always be performed.\nAdditional capabilities.\nMany also include:\nSome include:\nSome computer algebra systems focus on specialized disciplines; these are typically developed in academia and are free. They can be inefficient for numeric operations as compared to numeric systems.\nTypes of expressions.\nThe expressions manipulated by the CAS typically include polynomials in multiple variables; standard functions of expressions (sine, exponential, etc.); various special functions (\u0393, \u03b6, erf, Bessel functions, etc.); arbitrary functions of expressions; optimization; derivatives, integrals, simplifications, sums, and products of expressions; truncated series with expressions as coefficients, matrices of expressions, and so on. Numeric domains supported typically include floating-point representation of real numbers, integers (of unbounded size), complex (floating-point representation), interval representation of reals, rational number (exact representation) and algebraic numbers.\nUse in education.\nThere have been many advocates for increasing the use of computer algebra systems in primary and secondary-school classrooms. The primary reason for such advocacy is that computer algebra systems represent real-world math more than do paper-and-pencil or hand calculator based mathematics.\nThis push for increasing computer usage in mathematics classrooms has been supported by some boards of education. It has even been mandated in the curriculum of some regions.\nComputer algebra systems have been extensively used in higher education. Many universities offer either specific courses on developing their use, or they implicitly expect students to use them for their course work. The companies that develop computer algebra systems have pushed to increase their prevalence among university and college programs.\nCAS-equipped calculators are not permitted on the ACT, the PLAN, the SAT, and in some classrooms though it may be permitted on College Board's calculator-permitted AP tests, including the AP Calculus, Chemistry, Physics, and Statistics exams.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54432", "revid": "50370522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54432", "title": "Unification (computer science)", "text": "Algorithmic process of solving equations\nIn logic and computer science, specifically automated reasoning, unification is an algorithmic process of solving equations between symbolic expressions, each of the form \"Left-hand side = Right-hand side\". For example, using \"x\",\"y\",\"z\" as variables, and taking \"f\" to be an uninterpreted function, the singleton equation set { \"f\"(1,\"y\") = \"f\"(\"x\",2) } is a syntactic first-order unification problem that has the substitution { \"x\" \u21a6 1, \"y\" \u21a6 2 } as its only solution.\nConventions differ on what values variables may assume and which expressions are considered equivalent. In first-order syntactic unification, variables range over first-order terms and equivalence is syntactic. This version of unification has a unique \"best\" answer and is used in logic programming and programming language type system implementation, especially in Hindley\u2013Milner based type inference algorithms. In higher-order unification, possibly restricted to higher-order pattern unification, terms may include lambda expressions, and equivalence is up to beta-reduction. This version is used in proof assistants and higher-order logic programming, for example Isabelle, Twelf, and lambdaProlog. Finally, in semantic unification or E-unification, equality is subject to background knowledge and variables range over a variety of domains. This version is used in SMT solvers, term rewriting algorithms, and cryptographic protocol analysis.\nFormal definition.\nA \"unification problem\" is a finite set \"E\"={\"l\"1 \u2250 \"r\"1, ..., \"l\"\"n\" \u2250 \"r\"\"n\"} of equations to solve, where \"l\"\"i\", \"r\"\"i\" are in the set formula_1 of \"terms\" or \"expressions\". Depending on which expressions or terms are allowed to occur in an equation set or unification problem, and which expressions are considered equal, several frameworks of unification are distinguished. If higher-order variables, that is, variables representing functions, are allowed in an expression, the process is called higher-order unification, otherwise \"first-order unification\". If a solution is required to make both sides of each equation literally equal, the process is called syntactic or \"free\" unification, otherwise \"semantic\" or \"equational unification\", or E-unification, or \"unification modulo theory\".\nIf the right side of each equation is closed (no free variables), the problem is called (pattern) \"matching\". The left side (with variables) of each equation is called the \"pattern\".\nPrerequisites.\nFormally, a unification approach presupposes\nAs an example of how the set of terms and theory affects the set of solutions, the syntactic first-order unification problem { \"y\" = \"cons\"(2,\"y\") } has no solution over the set of finite terms. However, it has the single solution { \"y\" \u21a6 \"cons\"(2,\"cons\"(2,\"cons\"(2...))) } over the set of infinite tree terms. Similarly, the semantic first-order unification problem { \"a\"\u22c5\"x\" = \"x\"\u22c5\"a\" } has each substitution of the form { \"x\" \u21a6 \"a\"\u22c5...\u22c5\"a\" } as a solution in a semigroup, i.e. if (\u22c5) is considered associative. But the same problem, viewed in an abelian group, where (\u22c5) is considered also commutative, has any substitution at all as a solution.\nAs an example of higher-order unification, the singleton set { \"a\" = \"y\"(\"x\") } is a syntactic second-order unification problem, since \"y\" is a function variable. One solution is { \"x\" \u21a6 \"a\", \"y\" \u21a6 (identity function) }; another one is { \"y\" \u21a6 (constant function mapping each value to \"a\"), \"x\" \u21a6 \"(any value)\" }.\nSubstitution.\nA \"substitution\" is a mapping formula_25 from variables to terms; the notation formula_26 refers to a substitution mapping each variable formula_27 to the term formula_28, for formula_29, and every other variable to itself; the formula_27 must be pairwise distinct. \"Applying\" that substitution to a term formula_11 is written in postfix notation as formula_32; it means to (simultaneously) replace every occurrence of each variable formula_27 in the term formula_11 by formula_28. The result formula_36 of applying a substitution formula_37 to a term formula_11 is called an \"instance\" of that term formula_11.\nAs a first-order example, applying the substitution {\"x\" \u21a6 \"h\"(\"a\",\"y\"), \"z\" \u21a6 \"b\"} to the term \nGeneralization, specialization.\nIf a term formula_11 has an instance equivalent to a term formula_19, that is, if formula_42 for some substitution formula_43, then formula_11 is called \"more general\" than formula_19, and formula_19 is called \"more special\" than, or \"subsumed\" by, formula_11. For example, formula_48 is more general than formula_49 if \u2295 is commutative, since then formula_50.\nIf \u2261 is literal (syntactic) identity of terms, a term may be both more general and more special than another one only if both terms differ just in their variable names, not in their syntactic structure; such terms are called \"variants\", or \"renamings\" of each other.\nFor example, \nformula_51\nis a variant of \nformula_52,\nsince\nformula_53\nand\nformula_54\nHowever, formula_51 is \"not\" a variant of formula_56, since no substitution can transform the latter term into the former one.\nThe latter term is therefore properly more special than the former one.\nFor arbitrary formula_14, a term may be both more general and more special than a structurally different term.\nFor example, if \u2295 is idempotent, that is, if always formula_58, then the term formula_59 is more general than formula_60, and vice versa, although formula_59 and formula_60 are of different structure.\nA substitution formula_43 is \"more special\" than, or \"subsumed\" by, a substitution formula_37 if formula_65 is subsumed by formula_36 for each term formula_11. We also say that formula_37 is more general than formula_43. More formally, take a nonempty infinite set formula_2 of auxiliary variables such that no equation formula_71 in the unification problem contains variables from formula_2. Then a substitution formula_43 is subsumed by another substitution formula_37 if there is a substitution formula_75 such that for all terms formula_76, formula_77.\nFor instance formula_78 is subsumed by formula_79, using formula_80, but \nformula_81 is not subsumed by formula_79, as formula_83 is not an instance of\nformula_84.\nSolution set.\nA substitution \u03c3 is a \"solution\" of the unification problem \"E\" if \"l\"\"i\"\u03c3 \u2261 \"r\"\"i\"\u03c3 for formula_85. Such a substitution is also called a \"unifier\" of \"E\".\nFor example, if \u2295 is associative, the unification problem { \"x\" \u2295 \"a\" \u2250 \"a\" \u2295 \"x\" } has the solutions {\"x\" \u21a6 \"a\"}, {\"x\" \u21a6 \"a\" \u2295 \"a\"}, {\"x\" \u21a6 \"a\" \u2295 \"a\" \u2295 \"a\"}, etc., while the problem { \"x\" \u2295 \"a\" \u2250 \"a\" } has no solution.\nFor a given unification problem \"E\", a set \"S\" of unifiers is called \"complete\" if each solution substitution is subsumed by some substitution in \"S\". A complete substitution set always exists (e.g. the set of all solutions), but in some frameworks (such as unrestricted higher-order unification) the problem of determining whether any solution exists (i.e., whether the complete substitution set is nonempty) is undecidable.\nThe set \"S\" is called \"minimal\" if none of its members subsumes another one. Depending on the framework, a complete and minimal substitution set may have zero, one, finitely many, or infinitely many members, or may not exist at all due to an infinite chain of redundant members. Thus, in general, unification algorithms compute a finite approximation of the complete set, which may or may not be minimal, although most algorithms avoid redundant unifiers when possible. For first-order syntactical unification, Martelli and Montanari gave an algorithm that reports unsolvability or computes a single unifier that by itself forms a complete and minimal substitution set, called the most general unifier.\nSyntactic unification of first-order terms.\n\"Syntactic unification of first-order terms\" is the most widely used unification framework.\nIt is based on \"T\" being the set of \"first-order terms\" (over some given set \"V\" of variables, \"C\" of constants and \"F\"\"n\" of \"n\"-ary function symbols) and on \u2261 being \"syntactic equality\".\nIn this framework, each solvable unification problem {\"l\"1 \u2250 \"r\"1, ..., \"l\"\"n\" \u2250 \"r\"\"n\"} has a complete, and obviously minimal, singleton solution set {\"\u03c3\"}.\nIts member \u03c3 is called the most general unifier (\"mgu\") of the problem.\nThe terms on the left and the right hand side of each potential equation become syntactically equal when the mgu is applied i.e. \"l\"1\"\u03c3\" = \"r\"1\"\u03c3\" \u2227 ... \u2227 \"l\"\"n\"\"\u03c3\" = \"r\"\"n\"\"\u03c3\".\nAny unifier of the problem is subsumed by the mgu \u03c3.\nThe mgu is unique up to variants: if \"S\"1 and \"S\"2 are both complete and minimal solution sets of the same syntactical unification problem, then \"S\"1 = { \"\u03c3\"1 } and \"S\"2 = { \"\u03c3\"2 } for some substitutions \"\u03c3\"1 and \"\u03c3\"2, and \"x\u03c3\"1 is a variant of \"x\u03c3\"2 for each variable \"x\" occurring in the problem.\nFor example, the unification problem { \"x\" \u2250 \"z\", \"y\" \u2250 \"f\"(\"x\") } has a unifier { \"x\" \u21a6 \"z\", \"y\" \u21a6 \"f\"(\"z\") }, because\nThis is also the most general unifier.\nOther unifiers for the same problem are e.g. { \"x\" \u21a6 \"f\"(\"x\"1), \"y\" \u21a6 \"f\"(\"f\"(\"x\"1)), \"z\" \u21a6 \"f\"(\"x\"1) }, { \"x\" \u21a6 \"f\"(\"f\"(\"x\"1)), \"y\" \u21a6 \"f\"(\"f\"(\"f\"(\"x\"1))), \"z\" \u21a6 \"f\"(\"f\"(\"x\"1)) }, and so on; there are infinitely many similar unifiers.\nAs another example, the problem \"g\"(\"x\",\"x\") \u2250 \"f\"(\"y\") has no solution with respect to \u2261 being literal identity, since any substitution applied to the left and right hand side will keep the outermost \"g\" and \"f\", respectively, and terms with different outermost function symbols are syntactically different.\nUnification algorithms.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRobinson's 1965 unification algorithm\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSymbols are ordered such that variables precede function symbols.\nTerms are ordered by increasing written length; equally long terms \nare ordered lexicographically.

But most authors attribute the first unification algorithm to John Alan Robinson (cf. box). Robinson's algorithm had worst-case exponential behavior in both time and space. Numerous authors have proposed more efficient unification algorithms. Algorithms with worst-case linear-time behavior were discovered independently by and uses a similar technique as Paterson-Wegman, hence is linear, but like most linear-time unification algorithms is slower than the Robinson version on small sized inputs due to the overhead of preprocessing the inputs and postprocessing of the output, such as construction of a DAG representation. is also of linear complexity in the input size but is competitive with the Robinson algorithm on small size inputs. The speedup is obtained by using an object-oriented representation of the predicate calculus that avoids the need for pre- and post-processing, instead making variable objects responsible for creating a substitution and for dealing with aliasing. de Champeaux claims that the ability to add functionality to predicate calculus represented as programmatic objects provides opportunities for optimizing other logic operations as well.\nThe following algorithm is commonly presented and originates from . Given a finite set formula_86 of potential equations,\nthe algorithm applies rules to transform it to an equivalent set of equations of the form\nwhere \"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"m\" are distinct variables and \"u\"1, ..., \"u\"\"m\" are terms containing none of the \"x\"\"i\".\nA set of this form can be read as a substitution.\nIf there is no solution the algorithm terminates with \u22a5; other authors use \"\u03a9\", or \"fail\" in that case.\nThe operation of substituting all occurrences of variable \"x\" in problem \"G\" with term \"t\" is denoted \"G\" {\"x\" \u21a6 \"t\"}.\nFor simplicity, constant symbols are regarded as function symbols having zero arguments.\nOccurs check.\nAn attempt to unify a variable \"x\" with a term containing \"x\" as a strict subterm \"x\" \u2250 \"f\"(..., \"x\", ...) would lead to an infinite term as solution for \"x\", since \"x\" would occur as a subterm of itself.\nIn the set of (finite) first-order terms as defined above, the equation \"x\" \u2250 \"f\"(..., \"x\", ...) has no solution; hence the \"eliminate\" rule may only be applied if \"x\" \u2209 \"vars\"(\"t\").\nSince that additional check, called \"occurs check\", slows down the algorithm, it is omitted e.g. in most Prolog systems.\nFrom a theoretical point of view, omitting the check amounts to solving equations over infinite trees, see #Unification of infinite terms below.\nProof of termination.\nFor the proof of termination of the algorithm consider a triple formula_87\nwhere \"n\"\"var\" is the number of variables that occur more than once in the equation set, \"n\"\"lhs\" is the number of function symbols and constants\non the left hand sides of potential equations, and \"n\"\"eqn\" is the number of equations.\nWhen rule \"eliminate\" is applied, \"n\"\"var\" decreases, since \"x\" is eliminated from \"G\" and kept only in { \"x\" \u2250 \"t\" }.\nApplying any other rule can never increase \"n\"\"var\" again.\nWhen rule \"decompose\", \"conflict\", or \"swap\" is applied, \"n\"\"lhs\" decreases, since at least the left hand side's outermost \"f\" disappears.\nApplying any of the remaining rules \"delete\" or \"check\" can't increase \"n\"\"lhs\", but decreases \"n\"\"eqn\".\nHence, any rule application decreases the triple formula_87 with respect to the lexicographical order, which is possible only a finite number of times.\nConor McBride observes that \"by expressing the structure which unification exploits\" in a dependently typed language such as Epigram, Robinson's unification algorithm can be made recursive on the number of variables, in which case a separate termination proof becomes unnecessary.\nExamples of syntactic unification of first-order terms.\nIn the Prolog syntactical convention a symbol starting with an upper case letter is a variable name; a symbol that starts with a lowercase letter is a function symbol; the comma is used as the logical \"and\" operator.\nFor mathematical notation, \"x,y,z\" are used as variables, \"f,g\" as function symbols, and \"a,b\" as constants.\nThe most general unifier of a syntactic first-order unification problem of size n may have a size of 2\"n\". For example, the problem &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; has the most general unifier &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;, cf. picture. In order to avoid exponential time complexity caused by such blow-up, advanced unification algorithms work on directed acyclic graphs (dags) rather than trees.\nApplication: unification in logic programming.\nThe concept of unification is one of the main ideas behind logic programming. Specifically, unification is a basic building block of resolution, a rule of inference for determining formula satisfiability. In Prolog, the equality symbol codice_1 implies first-order syntactic unification. It represents the mechanism of binding the contents of variables and can be viewed as a kind of one-time assignment.\nIn Prolog:\nApplication: type inference.\nType inference algorithms are typically based on unification, particularly Hindley-Milner type inference which is used by the functional languages Haskell and ML. For example, when attempting to infer the type of the Haskell expression codice_9, the compiler will use the type codice_10 of the list construction function codice_11, the type codice_12 of the first argument codice_13, and the type codice_14 of the second argument codice_15. The polymorphic type variable codice_16 will be unified with codice_12 and the second argument codice_18 will be unified with codice_14. codice_16 cannot be both codice_12 and codice_22 at the same time, therefore this expression is not correctly typed.\nLike for Prolog, an algorithm for type inference can be given:\nApplication: Feature Structure Unification.\nUnification has been used in different research areas of computational linguistics.\nOrder-sorted unification.\n\"Order-sorted logic\" allows one to assign a \"sort\", or \"type\", to each term, and to declare a sort \"s\"1 a \"subsort\" of another sort \"s\"2, commonly written as \"s\"1 \u2286 \"s\"2. For example, when re\u0430soning about biological creatures, it is useful to declare a sort \"dog\" to be a subsort of a sort \"animal\". Wherever a term of some sort \"s\" is required, a term of any subsort of \"s\" may be supplied instead.\nFor example, assuming a function declaration \"mother\": \"animal\" \u2192 \"animal\", and a constant declaration \"lassie\": \"dog\", the term \"mother\"(\"lassie\") is perfectly valid and has the sort \"animal\". In order to supply the information that the mother of a dog is a dog in turn, another declaration \"mother\": \"dog\" \u2192 \"dog\" may be issued; this is called \"function overloading\", similar to overloading in programming languages.\nWalther gave a unification algorithm for terms in order-sorted logic, requiring for any two declared sorts \"s\"1, \"s\"2 their intersection \"s\"1 \u2229 \"s\"2 to be declared, too: if \"x\"1 and \"x\"2 is a variable of sort \"s\"1 and \"s\"2, respectively, the equation \"x\"1 \u2250 \"x\"2 has the solution { \"x\"1 = \"x\", \"x\"2 = \"x\" }, where \"x\": \"s\"1 \u2229 \"s\"2.\nAfter incorporating this algorithm into a clause-based automated theorem prover, he could solve a benchmark problem by translating it into order-sorted logic, thereby boiling it down an order of magnitude, as many unary predicates turned into sorts.\nSmolka generalized order-sorted logic to allow for parametric polymorphism.\nIn his framework, subsort declarations are propagated to complex type expressions.\nAs a programming example, a parametric sort \"list\"(\"X\") may be declared (with \"X\" being a type parameter as in a C++ template), and from a subsort declaration \"int\" \u2286 \"float\" the relation \"list\"(\"int\") \u2286 \"list\"(\"float\") is automatically inferred, meaning that each list of integers is also a list of floats.\nSchmidt-Schau\u00df generalized order-sorted logic to allow for term declarations.\nAs an example, assuming subsort declarations \"even\" \u2286 \"int\" and \"odd\" \u2286 \"int\", a term declaration like \u2200 \"i\" : \"int\". (\"i\" + \"i\") : \"even\" allows to declare a property of integer addition that could not be expressed by ordinary overloading.\nUnification of infinite terms.\nBackground on infinite trees:\nUnification algorithm, Prolog II:\nApplications:\nE-unification.\nE-unification is the problem of finding solutions to a given set of equations,\ntaking into account some equational background knowledge \"E\".\nThe latter is given as a set of universal equalities.\nFor some particular sets \"E\", equation solving algorithms (a.k.a. \"E-unification algorithms\") have been devised;\nfor others it has been proven that no such algorithms can exist.\nFor example, if a and b are distinct constants,\nthe equation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; has no solution\nwith respect to purely syntactic unification,\nwhere nothing is known about the operator &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nHowever, if the &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is known to be commutative,\nthen the substitution {\"x\" \u21a6 \"b\", \"y\" \u21a6 \"a\"} solves the above equation,\nsince\nThe background knowledge \"E\" could state the commutativity of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; by the universal equality\n\"&amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; for all \"u\", \"v\"\".\nParticular background knowledge sets E.\nIt is said that \"unification is decidable\" for a theory, if a unification algorithm has been devised for it that terminates for \"any\" input problem.\nIt is said that \"unification is semi-decidable\" for a theory, if a unification algorithm has been devised for it that terminates for any \"solvable\" input problem, but may keep searching forever for solutions of an unsolvable input problem.\n\"Unification is decidable\" for the following theories:\n\"Unification is semi-decidable\" for the following theories:\nOne-sided paramodulation.\nIf there is a convergent term rewriting system \"R\" available for \"E\",\nthe \"one-sided paramodulation\" algorithm\ncan be used to enumerate all solutions of given equations.\nStarting with \"G\" being the unification problem to be solved and \"S\" being the identity substitution, rules are applied nondeterministically until the empty set appears as the actual \"G\", in which case the actual \"S\" is a unifying substitution. Depending on the order the paramodulation rules are applied, on the choice of the actual equation from \"G\", and on the choice of \"R\"'s rules in \"mutate\", different computations paths are possible. Only some lead to a solution, while others end at a \"G\" \u2260 {} where no further rule is applicable (e.g. \"G\" = { \"f\"(...) \u2250 \"g\"(...) }).\nFor an example, a term rewrite system \"R\" is used defining the \"append\" operator of lists built from \"cons\" and \"nil\"; where \"cons\"(\"x\",\"y\") is written in infix notation as \"x\".\"y\" for brevity; e.g. \"app\"(\"a\".\"b\".\"nil\",\"c\".\"d\".\"nil\") \u2192 \"a\".\"app\"(\"b\".\"nil\",\"c\".\"d\".\"nil\") \u2192 \"a\".\"b\".\"app\"(\"nil\",\"c\".\"d\".\"nil\") \u2192 \"a\".\"b\".\"c\".\"d\".\"nil\" demonstrates the concatenation of the lists \"a\".\"b\".\"nil\" and \"c\".\"d\".\"nil\", employing the rewrite rule 2,2, and 1. The equational theory \"E\" corresponding to \"R\" is the congruence closure of \"R\", both viewed as binary relations on terms.\nFor example, \"app\"(\"a\".\"b\".\"nil\",\"c\".\"d\".\"nil\") \u2261 \"a\".\"b\".\"c\".\"d\".\"nil\" \u2261 \"app\"(\"a\".\"b\".\"c\".\"d\".\"nil\",\"nil\"). The paramodulation algorithm enumerates solutions to equations with respect to that \"E\" when fed with the example \"R\".\nA successful example computation path for the unification problem { \"app\"(\"x\",\"app\"(\"y\",\"x\")) \u2250 \"a\".\"a\".\"nil\" } is shown below. To avoid variable name clashes, rewrite rules are consistently renamed each time before their use by rule \"mutate\"; \"v\"2, \"v\"3, ... are computer-generated variable names for this purpose. In each line, the chosen equation from \"G\" is highlighted in red. Each time the \"mutate\" rule is applied, the chosen rewrite rule (\"1\" or \"2\") is indicated in parentheses. From the last line, the unifying substitution \"S\" = { \"y\" \u21a6 \"nil\", \"x\" \u21a6 \"a\".\"nil\" } can be obtained. In fact,\n\"app\"(\"x\",\"app\"(\"y\",\"x\")) {\"y\"\u21a6\"nil\", \"x\"\u21a6 \"a\".\"nil\" } = \"app\"(\"a\".\"nil\",\"app\"(\"nil\",\"a\".\"nil\")) \u2261 \"app\"(\"a\".\"nil\",\"a\".\"nil\") \u2261 \"a\".\"app\"(\"nil\",\"a\".\"nil\") \u2261 \"a\".\"a\".\"nil\" solves the given problem.\nA second successful computation path, obtainable by choosing \"mutate(1), mutate(2), mutate(2), mutate(1)\" leads to the substitution \"S\" = { \"y\" \u21a6 \"a\".\"a\".\"nil\", \"x\" \u21a6 \"nil\" }; it is not shown here. No other path leads to a success.\nNarrowing.\nIf \"R\" is a convergent term rewriting system for \"E\",\nan approach alternative to the previous section consists in successive application of \"narrowing steps\";\nthis will eventually enumerate all solutions of a given equation.\nA narrowing step (cf. picture) consists in\nFormally, if \"l\" \u2192 \"r\" is a renamed copy of a rewrite rule from \"R\", having no variables in common with a term \"s\", and the subterm \"s\"|\"p\" is not a variable and is unifiable with l via the mgu \u03c3, then s can be \"narrowed\" to the term \"t\" = \"s\u03c3\"[\"r\u03c3\"]\"p\", i.e. to the term s\u03c3, with the subterm at \"p\" replaced by r\u03c3. The situation that \"s\" can be narrowed to \"t\" is commonly denoted as \"s\" \u219d \"t\".\nIntuitively, a sequence of narrowing steps \"t\"1 \u219d \"t\"2 \u219d ... \u219d \"t\"\"n\" can be thought of as a sequence of rewrite steps \"t\"1 \u2192 \"t\"2 \u2192 ... \u2192 \"t\"\"n\", but with the initial term \"t\"1 being further and further instantiated, as necessary to make each of the used rules applicable.\nThe above example paramodulation computation corresponds to the following narrowing sequence (\"\u2193\" indicating instantiation here):\nThe last term, \"v\"2.\"v\"2.\"nil\" can be syntactically unified with the original right hand side term \"a\".\"a\".\"nil\".\nThe \"narrowing lemma\" ensures that whenever an instance of a term \"s\" can be rewritten to a term \"t\" by a convergent term rewriting system, then \"s\" and \"t\" can be narrowed and rewritten to a term \"s\"\u2032 and \"t\"\u2032, respectively, such that \"t\"\u2032 is an instance of \"s\"\u2032.\nFormally: whenever \"s\u03c3\" \u2192\u2217 \"t\" holds for some substitution \u03c3, then there exist terms \"s\"\u2032, \"t\"\u2032 such that \"s\" \u219d\u2217 \"s\"\u2032 and \"t\" \u2192\u2217 \"t\"\u2032 and \"s\"\u2032 \"\u03c4\" = \"t\"\u2032 for some substitution \u03c4.\nHigher-order unification.\nMany applications require one to consider the unification of typed lambda-terms instead of first-order terms. Such unification is often called \"higher-order unification\". Higher-order unification is undecidable, and such unification problems do not have most general unifiers. For example, the unification problem { \"f\"(\"a\",\"b\",\"a\") \u2250 \"d\"(\"b\",\"a\",\"c\") }, where the only variable is \"f\", has the\nsolutions {\"f\" \u21a6 \u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\u03bb\"z\". \"d\"(\"y\",\"x\",\"c\") }, {\"f\" \u21a6 \u03bb\"x\".\u03bb\"y\".\u03bb\"z\". \"d\"(\"y\",\"z\",\"c\") },\nSeveral subsets of higher-order unification are well-behaved, in that they are decidable and have a most-general unifier for solvable problems. One such subset is the previously described first-order terms. Higher-order pattern unification, due to Dale Miller, is another such subset. The higher-order logic programming languages \u03bbProlog and Twelf have switched from full higher-order unification to implementing only the pattern fragment; surprisingly pattern unification is sufficient for almost all programs, if each non-pattern unification problem is suspended until a subsequent substitution puts the unification into the pattern fragment. A superset of pattern unification called functions-as-constructors unification is also well-behaved. The Zipperposition theorem prover has an algorithm integrating these well-behaved subsets into a full higher-order unification algorithm.\nIn computational linguistics, one of the most influential theories of elliptical construction is that ellipses are represented by free variables whose values are then determined using Higher-Order Unification. For instance, the semantic representation of \"Jon likes Mary and Peter does too\" is like(\"j\", \"m\") \u2227 R(\"p\") and the value of R (the semantic representation of the ellipsis) is determined by the equation like(\"j\", \"m\") \n R(\"j\") . The process of solving such equations is called Higher-Order Unification.\nWayne Snyder gave a generalization of both higher-order unification and E-unification, i.e. an algorithm to unify lambda-terms modulo an equational theory.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54436", "revid": "43647283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54436", "title": "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", "text": "1900 children's novel by L. Frank Baum\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a 1900 children's novel written by author L.\u00a0Frank Baum and illustrated by W.\u00a0W.\u00a0Denslow. It is the first novel in the Oz series of books. A Kansas farm girl named Dorothy ends up in the magical Land of Oz after she and her pet dog Toto are swept away from their home by a cyclone. Upon her arrival in the magical world of Oz, she learns she cannot return home until she has destroyed the Wicked Witch of the West.\nThe book was first published in the United States in September 1900 by the George M.\u00a0Hill Company. It had sold three million copies by the time it entered the public domain in 1956. It was often reprinted under the title The Wizard of Oz, which is the title of the successful 1902 Broadway musical adaptation as well as the 1939 live-action film.\nThe ground-breaking success of both the original 1900 novel and the 1902 musical prompted Baum to write thirteen additional Oz books, which serve as official sequels to the first story. Over a century later, the book is one of the best-known stories in American literature, and the Library of Congress has declared the work to be \"America's greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale\".\nPublication.\nL. Frank Baum's story was published by George M.\u00a0Hill Company. The first edition had a printing of 10,000 copies and was sold in advance of the publication date of September\u00a01, 1900. On May\u00a017, 1900, the first copy came off the press; Baum assembled it by hand and presented it to his sister, Mary Louise Baum Brewster. The public saw it for the first time at a book fair at the Palmer House in Chicago, July 5\u201320. Its copyright was registered on August\u00a01; full distribution followed in September. By October 1900, the first edition had already sold out, and the second edition of 15,000 copies was nearly depleted.\nIn a letter to his brother, Baum wrote that the book's publisher, George M.\u00a0Hill, predicted a sale of about 250,000 copies. In spite of this favorable conjecture, Hill did not initially predict that the book would be phenomenally successful. He agreed to publish the book only when the manager of the Chicago Grand Opera House, Fred R.\u00a0Hamlin, committed to making it into a musical stage play to publicize the novel.\nThe play \"The Wizard of Oz\" debuted on June\u00a016, 1902. It was revised to suit adult preferences and was crafted as a \"musical extravaganza\", with the costumes modeled after Denslow's drawings. When Hill's publishing company became bankrupt in 1901, the Indianapolis-based Bobbs-Merrill Company resumed publishing the novel. By 1938, more than one million copies of the book had been printed. By 1956, sales had grown to three million copies.\nPlot.\nDorothy Gale is a young girl who lives with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and dog, Toto, on a farm on the Kansas prairie. One day, Dorothy and Toto are caught up in a \"cyclone\" (more accurately a tornado) that deposits them and the farmhouse into Munchkin Country in the magical Land of Oz. The falling house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East, the evil ruler of the Munchkins. The Good Witch of the North arrives with three grateful Munchkins and gives Dorothy the magical silver shoes that originally belonged to the Wicked Witch. The Good Witch tells Dorothy that the only way she can return home to Kansas is to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and ask the great and powerful Wizard of Oz to help her. As Dorothy embarks on her journey, the Good Witch of the North kisses her on the forehead, giving her magical protection from harm.\nOn her way down the yellow brick road, Dorothy attends a banquet held by a Munchkin named Boq. The next day, she frees a Scarecrow from the pole on which he is hanging, applies oil from a can to the rusted joints of a Tin Woodman, and meets a Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Lion wants courage, so Dorothy encourages them to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald City to ask for help from the Wizard.\nAfter several adventures, the travelers arrive at the Emerald City and meet the Guardian of the Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes from being blinded by the city's brilliance. Each one is called to see the Wizard. He appears to Dorothy as a giant head, to the Scarecrow as a lovely lady, to the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and to the Lion as a ball of fire, with the intention of scaring them all. He agrees to help them all if they kill the Wicked Witch of the West, who rules over Winkie Country. The Guardian warns them that no one has ever managed to defeat the Witch of the West.\nThe Wicked Witch of the West sees the travelers approaching with her one telescopic eye. She sends a pack of wolves to tear them to pieces, but the Tin Woodman kills them with his axe. She sends a flock of wild crows to peck their eyes out, but the Scarecrow kills them by twisting their necks. She summons a swarm of black bees to sting them, but they are killed while trying to sting the Tin Woodman while the Scarecrow's straw hides the others. She sends a dozen of her Winkie slaves to attack them, but the Lion stands firm to repel them. Finally, she uses the power of her Golden Cap to send the Winged Monkeys to capture Dorothy, Toto, and the Lion. She cages the Lion, scatters the straw of the Scarecrow, and dents the Tin Woodman. Dorothy is forced to become the witch's personal slave, while the Witch schemes to steal her silver shoes' powerful magic.\nThe witch successfully tricks Dorothy out of one of her silver shoes. Angered, she throws a bucket of water at the witch and is shocked to see her melt away. The Winkies rejoice at being freed from her tyranny and help restuff the Scarecrow and mend the Tin Woodman. They ask the Tin Woodman to become their ruler, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy finds the witch's Golden Cap and summons the Winged Monkeys to carry her and her friends back to the Emerald City. The King of the Winged Monkeys tells how he and his band are bound by an enchantment to the cap by the sorceress Gayelette from the North, and that Dorothy may use it to summon them two more times.\nWhen Dorothy and her friends meet the Wizard again, Toto tips over a screen in a corner of the throne room that reveals \"the Wizard\", who sadly explains he is a humbug\u2014an ordinary old man who, by a hot air balloon, came to Oz long ago from Omaha. He provides the Scarecrow with a head full of bran, pins, and needles (\"a lot of bran-new brains\"), the Tin Woodman with a silk heart stuffed with sawdust, and the Lion a potion of \"courage\". Their faith in his power gives these items a focus for their desires. He decides to take Dorothy and Toto home and then go back to Omaha in his balloon. At the send-off, he appoints the Scarecrow to rule in his stead, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Toto chases a kitten in the crowd and Dorothy goes after him, but the ropes holding the balloon break and the Wizard floats away.\nDorothy summons the Winged Monkeys and tells them to carry her and Toto home, but they explain they cannot cross the desert surrounding Oz. The Soldier with the Green Whiskers informs Dorothy that Glinda, the Good Witch of the South may be able to help her return home, so the travelers begin their journey to see Glinda's castle in Quadling Country. On the way, the Lion kills a giant spider who is terrorizing the animals in a forest. They ask him to become their king, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy summons the Winged Monkeys a third time to fly them over a hill to Glinda's castle.\nGlinda greets them and reveals that Dorothy's silver shoes can take her anywhere she wishes to go. She embraces her friends, all of whom will be returned to their new kingdoms through Glinda's three uses of the Golden Cap: the Scarecrow to the Emerald City, the Tin Woodman to Winkie Country, and the Lion to the forest; after which the cap will be given to the King of the Winged Monkeys, freeing him and his band. Dorothy takes Toto in her arms, knocks her heels together three times, and wishes to return home. Instantly, she begins whirling through the air and rolling on the grass of the Kansas prairie, up to the farmhouse, though the silver shoes fall off her feet en route and are lost in the Deadly Desert. She runs to Aunt Em, saying \"I'm so glad to be home again!\"\nIllustrations.\n Illustrator W. W. Denslow co-held the copyright with L. Frank Baum.\nThe book was illustrated by Baum's friend and collaborator W. W. Denslow, who also co-held the copyright. The design was lavish for the time, with illustrations on many pages, backgrounds in different colors, and several color plate illustrations. The typeface featured the newly designed Monotype Old Style. In September 1900, The \"Grand Rapids Herald\" wrote that Denslow's illustrations are \"quite as much of the story as in the writing\". The editorial opined that had it not been for Denslow's pictures, the readers would be unable to picture precisely the figures of Dorothy, Toto, and the other characters.\nDenslow's illustrations were so well known that merchants of many products obtained permission to use them to promote their wares. The forms of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, the Wizard, and Dorothy were made into rubber and metal sculptures. Costume jewelry, mechanical toys, and soaps were also designed using their figures. The distinctive look of Denslow's illustrations led to imitators at the time, most notably Eva Katherine Gibson's \"Zauberlinda, the Wise Witch\", which mimicked both the typography and the illustration design of \"Oz\".\nA new edition of the book appeared in 1944, with illustrations by Evelyn Copelman. Although it was claimed that the new illustrations were based on Denslow's originals, they more closely resemble the characters as seen in the famous 1939 film version of Baum's book.\nCreative inspiration.\nBaum's personal life.\nAccording to Baum's son, Harry Neal, the author had often told his children \"whimsical stories before they became material for his books\". Harry Baum called his father the \"swellest man I knew\", a man who was able to give a decent reason as to why black birds cooked in a pie could afterwards get out and sing.\nMany of the characters, props, and ideas in the novel were drawn from Baum's personal life and experiences. Baum held different jobs, moved a lot, and was exposed to many people, so the inspiration for the story could have been taken from many different aspects of his life. In the introduction to the story, Baum writes that \"it aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heart-aches and nightmares are left out\".\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman.\nAs a child, Baum frequently had nightmares of a scarecrow pursuing him across a field. Moments before the scarecrow's \"ragged hay fingers\" nearly gripped his neck, it would fall apart before his eyes. Decades later, as an adult, Baum integrated his tormentor into the novel as the Scarecrow. In the early 1880s, Baum's play \"Matches\" was being performed when a \"flicker from a kerosene lantern sparked the rafters\", causing the Baum opera house to be consumed by flames. Scholar Evan I.\u00a0Schwartz suggested that this might have inspired the Scarecrow's severest terror: \"There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of. A lighted match.\"\nAccording to Baum's son Harry, the Tin Woodman was born from Baum's attraction to window displays. He wished to make something captivating for the window displays, so he used an eclectic assortment of scraps to craft a striking figure. From a wash-boiler he made a body, from bolted stovepipes he made arms and legs, and from the bottom of a saucepan he made a face. Baum then placed a funnel hat on the figure, which ultimately became the Tin Woodman.\nDorothy, Uncle Henry, and the Witches.\nBaum's wife Maud Gage frequently visited their newborn niece, Dorothy Louise Gage, whom she adored as the daughter she never had. The infant became gravely sick and died at the age of five months in Bloomington, Illinois, on November\u00a011, 1898, from \"congestion of the brain\". Maud was devastated. To assuage her distress, Baum made his protagonist of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" a girl named Dorothy, and he dedicated the book to his wife. The baby was buried at Evergreen Cemetery, where her gravestone has a statue of the character Dorothy placed next to it. Baum's mother-in-law, activist Matilda Joslyn Gage, has also been cited as one of the inspirations for Dorothy.\nDecades later, Jocelyn Burdick\u2014the daughter of Baum's other niece, Magdalena Carpenter, and a former Democratic U.S. Senator from North Dakota\u2014asserted that her mother also partly inspired the character of Dorothy. Burdick claimed that her great-uncle spent \"considerable time at the \u0421arpenter homestead\u00a0... and became very attached to Magdalena\". Burdick has reported many similarities between her mother's homestead and the farm of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.\nUncle Henry was modeled after Henry Gage, Baum's father-in-law. Bossed around by his wife Matilda, Henry rarely dissented with her. He flourished in business, though, and his neighbors looked up to him. Likewise, Uncle Henry was a \"passive but hard-working man\" who \"looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke\".\nThe witches in the novel were influenced by witch-hunting research gathered by Matilda Joslyn Gage. The stories of barbarous acts against accused witches scared Baum. Two key events in the novel involve wicked witches who meet their death through metaphorical means. Baum's biographers have also drawn correlations between Baum's Good Witch and Gage's feminist writings.\nThe Emerald City and the Land of Oz.\nIn 1890, Baum lived in Aberdeen, South Dakota during a drought, and he wrote a story in his \"Our Landlady\" column in Aberdeen's \"The Saturday Pioneer\" about a farmer who gave green goggles to his horses, causing them to believe that the wood chips that they were eating were pieces of grass. Similarly, the Wizard made the people in the Emerald City wear green goggles so that they would believe that their city was built from emeralds.\nDuring Baum's short stay in Aberdeen, the dissemination of myths about the West continued. However, the West, instead of being a wonderland, turned into a wasteland because of a drought and a depression. In 1891, Baum moved his family from South Dakota to Chicago. At that time, Chicago was getting ready for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Scholar Laura Barrett stated that Chicago was \"considerably more akin to Oz than to Kansas\". After discovering that the myths about the West's incalculable riches were baseless, Baum created \"an extension of the American frontier in Oz\". In many respects, Baum's creation is similar to the actual frontier save for the fact that the West was still undeveloped at the time. The Munchkins Dorothy encounters at the beginning of the novel represent farmers, as do the Winkies she later meets.\nLocal legend has it that the Emerald City, home of the Wizard of Oz, was inspired by a prominent castle-like building in the community of Castle Park near Holland, Michigan, where Baum lived during the summer. The yellow brick road was derived from a road at that time paved by yellow bricks, located in Peekskill, New York, where Baum attended the Peekskill Military Academy. Baum scholars often refer to the 1893 Chicago World's Fair (the \"White City\") as an inspiration for the Emerald City. Other legends suggest that the inspiration came from the Hotel Del Coronado near San Diego, California. Baum was a frequent guest at the hotel and had written several of the Oz books there. In a 1903 interview with \"The Publishers' Weekly\", Baum said that the name \"Oz\" came from his file cabinet labeled \"O\u2013Z\".\nSome critics have suggested that Baum's Oz may have been inspired by Australia. Australia is often colloquially spelled or referred to as \"Oz\". Furthermore, in \"Ozma of Oz\" (1907), Dorothy gets back to Oz as the result of a storm at sea while she and Uncle Henry are traveling by ship to Australia. Like Australia, Oz is an island continent somewhere to the west of California with inhabited regions bordering on a great desert. Baum perhaps intended Oz to be Australia or a magical land in the center of the great Australian desert.\n\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".\nIn addition to being influenced by the fairy-tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, Baum was significantly influenced by English writer Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". Although Baum found the plot of Carroll's novel to be incoherent, he identified the book's source of popularity as Alice herself\u2014a child with whom younger readers could identify, and this influenced Baum's choice of Dorothy as his protagonist.\nAlthough influenced by Carroll's distinctly English work, Baum nonetheless sought to create a story that had recognizable American elements, such as farming and industrialization. Consequently, Baum combined the conventional features of a fairy tale such as witches and wizards with well-known fixtures in his young readers' Midwestern lives such as scarecrows and cornfields.\nInfluence of Denslow.\nThe original illustrator of the novel, W. W. Denslow, aided in the development of Baum's story and greatly influenced the way it has been interpreted. Baum and Denslow had a close working relationship and worked together to create the presentation of the story through the images and the text. Color is an important element of the story and is present throughout the images, with each chapter having a different color representation. Denslow also added characteristics to his drawings that Baum never described. For example, Denslow drew a house and the gates of the Emerald City with faces on them.\nIn the later \"Oz\" books, John R. Neill, who illustrated all the sequels, continued to use elements from Denslow's earlier illustrations, including faces on the Emerald City's gates. Another aspect is the Tin Woodman's funnel hat, which is not mentioned in the text until later books but appears in most artists' interpretation of the character, including the stage and film productions of 1902\u20131909, 1908, 1910, 1914, 1925, 1931, 1933, 1939, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1992, and others. One of the earliest illustrators not to include a funnel hat was Russell H.\u00a0Schulz in the 1957 Whitman Publishing edition\u2014Schulz depicted him wearing a pot on his head. Libico Maraja's illustrations, which first appeared in a 1957 Italian edition and have also appeared in English-language and other editions, are well known for depicting him bareheaded.\nCritical response.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis last story of \"The Wizard\" is ingeniously woven out of commonplace material. It is, of course, an extravaganza, but will surely be found to appeal strongly to child readers as well as to the younger children, to whom it will be read by mothers or those having charge of the entertaining of children. There seems to be an inborn love of stories in child minds, and one of the most familiar and pleading requests of children is to be told another story.\nThe drawing as well as the introduced color work vies with the texts drawn, and the result has been a book that rises far above the average children's book of today, high as is the present standard...\nThe book has a bright and joyous atmosphere, and does not dwell upon killing and deeds of violence. Enough stirring adventure enters into it, however, to flavor it with zest, and it will indeed be strange if there be a normal child who will not enjoy the story.\n \"The New York Times\", September 8, 1900\n\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" received positive critical reviews upon release. In a September 1900 review, \"The New York Times\" praised the novel, writing that it would appeal to child readers and to younger children who could not read yet. The review also praised the illustrations for being a pleasant complement to the text.\nDuring the subsequent decades after the novel's publication in 1900, it received little critical analysis from scholars of children's literature. Lists of suggested reading published for juvenile readers never contained Baum's work, and his works were rarely assigned in classrooms. This lack of interest stemmed from the scholars' misgivings about fantasy, as well as to their belief that lengthy series had little literary merit.\nIt frequently came under fire in later decades. In 1957, the director of Detroit's libraries banned \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" for having \"no value\" for children of today, for supporting \"negativism\", and for bringing children's minds to a \"cowardly level\". Professor Russel B.\u00a0Nye of Michigan State University countered that \"if the message of the Oz books\u2014love, kindness, and unselfishness make the world a better place\u2014seems of no value today\", then maybe the time is ripe for \"reassess[ing] a good many other things besides the Detroit library's approved list of children's books\".\nIn 1986, seven Fundamentalist Christian families in Tennessee opposed the novel's inclusion in the public school syllabus and filed a lawsuit. They based their opposition to the novel on its depicting benevolent witches and promoting the belief that integral human attributes were \"individually developed rather than God-given\". One parent said: \"I do not want my children seduced into godless supernaturalism.\" Other reasons included the novel's teaching that females are equal to males and that animals are personified and can speak. The judge ruled that when the novel was being discussed in class, the parents were allowed to have their children leave the classroom.\nIn April 2000, the Library of Congress declared \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" to be \"America's greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale\", also naming it the first American fantasy for children and one of the most-read children's books. Leonard Everett Fisher of \"The Horn Book Magazine\" wrote in 2000 that \"Oz\" has \"a timeless message from a less complex era, and it continues to resonate\". The challenge of valuing oneself during impending adversity has not, Fisher noted, lessened during the prior 100 years. Two years later, in a 2002 review, Bill Delaney of \"Salem Press\" praised Baum for giving children the opportunity to discover magic in the mundane things in their everyday lives. He further commended Baum for teaching \"millions of children to love reading during their crucial formative years\". In 2012 it was ranked number 41 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by \"School Library Journal\".\nEditions.\nAfter George M. Hill's bankruptcy in 1902, copyright in the book passed to the Bowen-Merrill Company of Indianapolis, which published most of Baum's other books from 1901 to 1903, both reprints (\"Father Goose, His Book\", \"The Magical Monarch of Mo\", \"American Fairy Tales\", \"Dot and Tot of Merryland\") and new works (\"The Master Key\", \"The Army Alphabet\", \"The Navy Alphabet\", \"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\", \"The Enchanted Island of Yew\", \"The Songs of Father Goose\"). Bowen-Merrill's 1903 edition initially had the title \"The New Wizard of Oz\", to distinguish it from the 1902 musical, which was by then better known than the original book and had a very different story. The word \"New\" was quickly dropped in subsequent printings, leaving the now-familiar shortened title, \"The Wizard of Oz\", and some minor textual changes were added, such as to \"yellow daises\", and changing a chapter title from \"The Rescue\" to \"How the Four Were Reunited\". The editions they published lacked most of the in-text color and color plates of the original. Many cost-cutting measures were implemented, including removal of some of the color printing without replacing it with black, printing nothing rather than the beard of the Soldier with the Green Whiskers.\nWhen Baum filed for bankruptcy after his critically and popularly successful film and stage production \"The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays\" failed to make back its production costs, Baum lost the rights to all of the books published by what was now called Bobbs-Merrill, and they were licensed to the M.\u00a0A.\u00a0Donahue Company, which printed them in significantly cheaper \"blotting paper\" editions with advertising that directly competed with Baum's more recent books, published by the Reilly &amp; Britton Company, from which he was making his living, explicitly hurting sales of \"The Patchwork Girl of Oz\", the new Oz book for 1913, to boost sales of \"Wizard\", which Donahue called in a full-page ad in \"The Publishers' Weekly\" (June\u00a028, 1913), Baum's \"one pre-eminently great Juvenile Book\". In a letter to Baum dated December\u00a031, 1914, F.\u00a0K.\u00a0Reilly lamented that the average buyer employed by a retail store would not understand why he should be expected to spend 75 cents for a copy of \"Tik-Tok of Oz\" when he could buy a copy of \"Wizard\" for between 33 and 36 cents. Baum had previously written a letter complaining about the Donahue deal, which he did not know about until it was fait accompli, and one of the investors who held \"The Wizard of Oz\" rights had inquired why the royalty was only five or six cents per copy, depending on quantity sold, which made no sense to Baum.\nA new edition from Bobbs-Merrill in 1949 illustrated by Evelyn Copelman, again titled \"The New Wizard of Oz\", paid lip service to Denslow but was based strongly, apart from the Lion, on the MGM movie. Copelman had illustrated a new edition of \"The Magical Monarch of Mo\" two years earlier.\nIt was not until the book entered the public domain in 1956 that new editions, either with the original color plates, or new illustrations, proliferated. A revised version of Copelman's artwork was published in a Grosset &amp; Dunlap edition, and Reilly &amp; Lee (formerly Reilly &amp; Britton) published an edition in line with the Oz sequels, which had previously treated \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\" as the first Oz book, not having the publication rights to \"Wizard\", with new illustrations by Dale Ulrey. Ulrey had previously illustrated Jack Snow's \"Jaglon and the Tiger-Faries\", an expansion of a Baum short story \"The Story of Jaglon\", and a 1955 edition of \"The Tin Woodman of Oz\", though both sold poorly. Later Reilly &amp; Lee editions used Denslow's original illustrations.\nNotable more recent editions are the 1986 Pennyroyal edition illustrated by Barry Moser, which was reprinted by the University of California Press, and the 2000 \"The Annotated Wizard of Oz\" edited by Michael Patrick Hearn (heavily revised from a 1972 edition that was printed in a wide format that allowed for it to be a facsimile of the original edition with notes and additional illustrations at the sides), which was published by W.\u00a0W.\u00a0Norton and included all the original color illustrations, as well as supplemental artwork by Denslow. Other centennial editions included University Press of Kansas's \"Kansas Centennial Edition\", illustrated by Michael McCurdy with black-and-white illustrations, and Robert Sabuda's pop-up book.\nSequels.\nBaum wrote \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" without any thought of a sequel. After reading the novel, thousands of children wrote letters to him, requesting that he craft another story about Oz. In 1904, amid financial difficulties, Baum wrote and published the first sequel, \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\", declaring that he grudgingly wrote the sequel to address the popular demand. He dedicated the book to stage actors Fred Stone and David C.\u00a0Montgomery who played the characters of the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman on stage. Baum wrote large roles for the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman that he deleted from the stage version, \"The Woggle-Bug\", after Montgomery and Stone had balked at leaving a successful show to do a sequel.\nBaum later wrote sequels in 1907, 1908, and 1909. In his 1910 \"The Emerald City of Oz\", he wrote that he could not continue writing sequels because Ozland had lost contact with the rest of the world. The children refused to accept this story, so Baum, in 1913 and every year thereafter until his death in May 1919, wrote an \"Oz\" book, ultimately writing 13 sequels and half a dozen Oz short stories.\nBaum explained the purpose of his novels in a note he penned to his sister, Mary Louise Brewster, in a copy of \"Mother Goose in Prose\" (1897), his first book. He wrote: \"To please a child is a sweet and a lovely thing that warms one's heart and brings its own reward.\" After Baum's death in 1919, Baum's publishers delegated the creation of more sequels to Ruth Plumly Thompson who wrote 21. An original \"Oz\" book was published every Christmas between 1913 and 1942. By 1956, five million copies of the \"Oz\" books had been published in the English language, while hundreds of thousands had been published in eight foreign languages.\nAdaptations.\n\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" has been adapted to other media numerous times. Within several decades after its publication, the book had inspired a number of stage and screen adaptations, including a profitable 1902 Broadway musical and three silent films. The most popular cinematic adaptation of the story is \"The Wizard of Oz\", the 1939 film starring Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Bert Lahr. The 1939 film was considered innovative because of its special effects and revolutionary use of Technicolor.\nThe story has been translated into other languages (at least once without permission, resulting in Alexander Volkov's \"The Wizard of the Emerald City\" novel and its sequels, which were translated into English by Sergei Sukhinov) and adapted into comics several times. Following the lapse of the original copyright, the characters have been adapted and reused in spin-offs, unofficial sequels, and reinterpretations, some of which have been controversial in their treatment of Baum's characters.\nInfluence and legacy.\n\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" has become an established part of multiple cultures, spreading from its early young American readership to becoming known throughout the world. It has been translated or adapted into nearly every major language, at times being modified in local variations. For instance, in some abridged Indian editions, the Tin Woodman was replaced with a horse. In Russia, a translation by Alexander Melentyevich Volkov produced six books, \"The Wizard of the Emerald City\" series, which became progressively distanced from the Baum version, as Ellie and her dog Totoshka travel throughout the Magic Land. The 1939 film adaptation has become a classic of popular culture, shown annually on American television from 1959 to 1998 and then several times a year every year beginning in 1999.\nIn 1974, the story was re-envisioned as \"The Wiz\", a Tony Award winning musical featuring an all-Black cast and set in the context of modern African-American culture. This musical was adapted in 1978 as the feature film \"The Wiz\", a musical adventure fantasy produced by Universal Pictures and Motown Productions.\nThere were several Hebrew translations published in Israel. As established in the first translation and kept in later ones, the book's \"Land of Oz\" was rendered in Hebrew as \"Eretz Uz\" (\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05e2\u05d5\u05e5)\u2014i.e. the same as the original Hebrew name of the Biblical \"Land of Uz\", homeland of Job. Thus, for Hebrew readers, this translators' choice added a layer of Biblical connotations absent from the English original.\nIn 2018, \"The Lost Art of Oz\" project was initiated to locate and catalogue the surviving original artwork John R. Neill, W. W. Denslow, Frank Kramer, Richard \"Dirk\" Gringhuis, and Dick Martin that was created to illustrate the \"Oz\" book series. In 2020, an Esperanto translation of the novel was used by a team of scientists to demonstrate a new method for encoding text in DNA that remains readable after repeated copying.\nAllegorical analysis.\nThis book also seems to follow Joseph Campbell's a \"Hero with a thousand faces\"/\"monomyth\" theme. \"To see The Wonderful Wizard of Oz simply as Dorothy's quest for a way to return to Kansas is to miss many of the sources of the books' strength, for like most quest heroes, Dorothy achieves far more than simply finding her way home.\" \"\"The Wizard of Oz\" follows the course of the hero's journey in the structure of 'Departure', 'Initiation', and 'Return' which Campbell describes in \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\"\".\nAllusions to 19th-century America.\nMany decades after its publication, Baum's work gave rise to various political interpretations, particularly regarding the 19th-century Populist movement in the United States. In a 1964 \"American Quarterly\" article titled \"The Wizard of Oz: Parable on Populism\", educator Henry Littlefield posited that the book served an allegory for the late 19th-century bimetallism debate regarding monetary policy. Littlefield's thesis achieved some support but was widely criticized by others. Other political interpretations soon followed. In 1971, historian Richard J. Jensen theorized in \"The Winning of the Midwest\" that \"Oz\" was derived from the common abbreviation for \"ounce\", used for denoting quantities of gold and silver.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the U.S., about 25% of the adult population has metabolic syndrome, a proportion increasing with age, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities.\nInsulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and prediabetes are closely related to one another and have overlapping aspects. The syndrome is thought to be caused by an underlying disorder of energy utilization and storage, but the cause of the syndrome is an area of ongoing medical research. Researchers debate whether a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome implies differential treatment or increases risk of cardiovascular disease beyond what is suggested by the sum of its individual components.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe key sign of metabolic syndrome is central obesity, also known as visceral, male-pattern or apple-shaped adiposity. It is characterized by adipose tissue accumulation predominantly around the waist and trunk. Other signs of metabolic syndrome include high blood pressure, decreased fasting serum HDL cholesterol, elevated fasting serum triglyceride level, impaired fasting glucose, insulin resistance, or prediabetes. Associated conditions include hyperuricemia; fatty liver (especially in concurrent obesity) progressing to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; polycystic ovarian syndrome in women and erectile dysfunction in men; and acanthosis nigricans.\nNeck circumference.\nNeck circumference has been used as a simple surrogate index of upper-body subcutaneous fat. Values &gt; (men) and &gt; (women) are considered high risk for metabolic syndrome, and large neck circumference more than doubles risk. In adults with overweight/obesity, clinically significant weight loss may protect against COVID-19, and neck circumference has been associated with increased risk of mechanical ventilation and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\nComplications.\nMetabolic syndrome can lead to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, kidney disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It is also associated with a significantly increased risk of surgical complications across most types of surgery in a 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis of &gt;13\u00a0million individuals.\nCauses.\nThe mechanisms underlying metabolic syndrome are under investigation and only partially elucidated. Most affected people are older, obese, sedentary, and have some degree of insulin resistance. Stress can also contribute. Important risk factors include diet (particularly sugar-sweetened beverages), genetics, aging, sedentary behaviour or low physical activity, disrupted chronobiology/sleep, mood disorders and some medications, and excessive alcohol use. The pathogenic role of excessive adipose expansion under sustained overeating and resulting lipotoxicity has also been proposed.\nMarkers of systemic inflammation including C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha\u00a0(TNF-\u03b1) are often increased. Some research has focused on increased uric acid levels from dietary fructose.\nModern \"Western diet\" patterns with high intake of energy-dense processed foods are a factor in the development of metabolic syndrome. Rather than total adiposity, the core clinical component is visceral/ectopic fat, and the principal metabolic abnormality is insulin resistance. A chronic energy surplus unmatched by activity may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance.\nStress.\nProlonged chronic stress may contribute to metabolic syndrome via dysregulation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis. Elevated cortisol can raise glucose and insulin levels, promoting visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension, and has effects on bone turnover.\nPathophysiology.\nIt is common for there to be a development of visceral fat, after which adipocytes increase plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1 and alter levels of other adipokines (e.g., adiponectin, resistin, PAI-1). TNF-\u03b1 can induce inflammatory cytokines and may trigger insulin resistance. Rat models with high-sucrose diets have shown progression from hypertriglyceridaemia to visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance. Increased adipose tissue elevates immune cells and chronic inflammation, contributing to hypertension, atherosclerosis and diabetes.\nThe endocannabinoid system may contribute to metabolic dysregulation. Overproduction can alter reward circuitry and executive function, perpetuating unhealthy behaviours. The brain modulates peripheral carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Overfeeding with sucrose/fructose, particularly with high-fat intake, can induce features of metabolic syndrome in animals. Arachidonic acid\u2013derived mediators (eicosanoids; 2-arachidonoylglycerol; anandamide) may link lipid oversupply and inflammation.\nDiagnosis.\nNCEP.\nAs of 2023, the U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel\u00a0III (2001) remains widely used. It requires at least three of the following:\n2009 Interim Joint Statement.\nThe International Diabetes Federation Task Force and partner organisations harmonised criteria in 2009. Diagnosis is three or more of:\nThis statement recognises population differences in waist risk thresholds and encourages common criteria with agreed cut points for international comparisons.\nThe prior IDF and revised NCEP definitions are similar, but differ on assumptions when body mass index \u226530\u00a0kg/m2 and on geography-specific waist cut points.\nWHO.\nThe World Health Organization (1999) requires one of diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose or insulin resistance and two of:\nEGIR.\nThe European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (1999) requires insulin resistance (top 25% fasting insulin among nondiabetic individuals) and two or more of:\nCardiometabolic index.\nThe Cardiometabolic Index (CMI) estimates risk of type\u00a02 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic issues from waist-to-height ratio and triglycerides-to-HDL-C ratio. CMI has also been explored alongside cardiovascular disease and erectile dysfunction. Anti-inflammatory dietary patterns may improve related markers.\nOther.\nHigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein is used to predict cardiovascular risk in metabolic syndrome and may predict nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Reproductive disorders (such as polycystic ovary syndrome in women of reproductive age) and erectile dysfunction or decreased total testosterone in men have also been associated.\nPrevention.\nPrevention of metabolic syndrome centres on improving modifiable lifestyle factors that contribute to excess visceral fat, insulin resistance, and cardiometabolic risk. Even modest, sustained changes in activity and diet have been shown to improve multiple components of the syndrome.\nRegular physical activity is strongly supported by clinical and public-health organizations. Guidelines from the American Heart Association recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, with additional muscle-strengthening exercises on two or more days per week. Walking\u2014even in shorter bouts that accumulate to 30 minutes per day\u2014is associated with measurable improvements in blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and waist circumference.\nDietary patterns emphasizing whole foods appear beneficial. Evidence from observational studies and randomized trials supports Mediterranean-style eating, which is associated with reduced central adiposity and improved lipid and glycaemic measures. Calorie reduction, improved diet quality, and lowering intake of refined carbohydrates also contribute to improved metabolic parameters. Time-restricted eating (a form of intermittent fasting) has shown preliminary benefits in reducing waist circumference and fasting glucose in adults with metabolic syndrome, though long-term effects remain under investigation.\nOther behavioural factors influence prevention outcomes. Adequate sleep duration and quality have been linked to lower cardiometabolic risk, with insufficient sleep associated with higher rates of hypertension, obesity, and dysregulated glucose metabolism. Reducing alcohol intake may also be protective, as heavy use can worsen hepatic and metabolic outcomes in people with underlying metabolic risk.\nAlthough individual-level changes are effective for many people, adherence varies widely in real-world settings. Public-health bodies\u2014including the International Obesity Taskforce\u2014argue that sustained prevention requires population-level interventions, such as improved access to healthy foods, urban design that supports physical activity, and policies addressing socioeconomic drivers of obesity.\nManagement.\nManagement focuses on reducing cardiovascular and metabolic risk through lifestyle modification, pharmacologic therapy, and, in selected cases, surgery. Because metabolic syndrome represents a cluster of interrelated conditions, treatment typically targets each component individually rather than the syndrome as a single entity.\nDiet and meal timing.\nA Mediterranean-style eating pattern\u2014emphasising vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and unsaturated fats\u2014is associated with improvements in blood pressure, lipids, insulin sensitivity, and cardiovascular risk. Reduced-carbohydrate approaches may lower glucose and promote weight loss in insulin-resistant individuals. Evidence on meal timing suggests time-restricted eating or avoidance of late-night meals can modestly improve glycaemic and lipid markers, though long-term data are limited. Guidance recommends tailoring dietary advice to personal preference, culture, and access to improve adherence.\nFollow-up and equity considerations.\nOngoing follow-up includes monitoring waist circumference, body weight, blood pressure, lipids, and fasting glucose or HbA1c. Recent guidance emphasises equitable care through culturally appropriate counselling, affordable medication access, and community-based support.\nMedications and therapies.\nTreatment of individual risk factors follows established cardiovascular and diabetes guidelines. \nPhysical activity and weight reduction.\nWeight loss of ~7\u201310% over 6\u201312 months improves BP, lipids, and insulin sensitivity. Public-health guidance advises \u2265150\u00a0min/week moderate aerobic activity (or 75\u00a0min vigorous) plus muscle-strengthening \u22652\u00a0days/week.\nSleep, tobacco, and alcohol.\nInadequate/irregular sleep and untreated obstructive sleep apnoea increase metabolic and CV risk. Smoking increases insulin resistance and CV risk; cessation reduces adverse outcomes. High alcohol intake raises BP, TGs, and hepatic steatosis; moderation is advised.\nSurgery.\nMetabolic (bariatric) surgery is considered when lifestyle and pharmacotherapy are insufficient. Surgery is associated with durable weight loss and partial or complete remission of type\u00a02 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. Guidelines endorse surgery for BMI \u226535\u00a0kg/m\u00b2, or \u226530\u00a0kg/m\u00b2 with metabolic complications.\nEpidemiology.\nApproximately 20\u201325% of the world's adults have metabolic syndrome. In 2000, ~32% of U.S. adults met criteria; more recent estimates are ~34%.\nIn young children, there is no consensus on measurement; age-specific cut points are not well established. Continuous risk scores are often used instead. Microbiome composition and some conditions have been associated with metabolic syndrome, sometimes with gender-specific patterns.\nHistory.\nIn 1921, Joslin reported the association of diabetes with hypertension and hyperuricaemia.\nIn 1923, Kylin expanded on this triad.\nIn 1947, Vague observed that upper-body obesity predisposed to diabetes, atherosclerosis, gout and calculi.\nThe term \"metabolic syndrome\" began appearing in the late 1950s. In 1967, Avogaro, Crepaldi and coworkers described moderately obese people with diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and marked hypertriglyceridemia that improved on hypocaloric, low-carbohydrate diets.\nIn 1977, Haller used the term for associations of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoproteinemia, hyperuricemia, and hepatic steatosis. The same year, Singer used it for associations of obesity, gout, diabetes, and hypertension with hyperlipoproteinemia.\nIn 1977\u20131978, Gerald B. Phillips proposed a \"constellation of abnormalities\" (glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension) and hypothesised sex hormones as a linking factor.\nIn 1988, Gerald M. Reaven's Banting lecture proposed insulin resistance as the underlying factor and coined \"syndrome X\"."}

Some small species of falcons with long, narrow wings are called hobbies, and some that hover while hunting are called kestrels. Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica, though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.\nAdult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. Fledgling falcons, in their first year of flying, have longer flight feathers, which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broadwing. This makes flying easier while still learning the aerial skills required to be effective hunters like the adults.\nThe falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae, which also includes two other subfamilies comprising caracaras and a few other species of \"falcons\". All these birds kill prey with their beaks, using a tomial \"tooth\" on the side of their beaks\u2014unlike the hawks, eagles and other larger birds of prey from the unrelated family Accipitridae, who use talons on their feet.\nThe largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to in length. The smallest falcon species is the pygmy falcon, which measures just . As with hawks and owls, falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the females typically larger than the males, thus allowing a wider range of prey species.\nAs is the case with many birds of prey, falcons have exceptional powers of vision; the visual acuity of one species has been measured at 2.6 times that of human eyes. They are fast fliers, with the Peregrine falcons having been recorded diving at speeds of , making them the fastest-moving creatures on Earth; the fastest recorded dive attained a vertical speed of .\nTaxonomy.\nThe genus \"Falco\" was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his \"Systema Naturae\". The type species is the merlin (\"Falco columbarius\"). The genus name is Late Latin meaning a \"falcon\" from , , meaning \"a sickle\", referring to the claws of the bird. In Middle English and Old French, the title refers generically to several captive raptor species.\nThe traditional term for a male falcon is \"tercel\" (British spelling) or \"tiercel\" (American spelling), from the Latin (third) because of the belief that only one in three eggs hatched a male bird. Some sources give the etymology as deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about one-third smaller than a female (). A falcon chick, especially one reared for falconry, still in its downy stage, is known as an \"eyas\" (sometimes spelled \"eyass\"). The word arose by mistaken division of Old French , from Latin presumed (nestling) from (nest). The technique of hunting with trained captive birds of prey is known as falconry.\nCompared to other birds of prey, the fossil record of the falcons is not well distributed in time. For years, the oldest fossils tentatively assigned to this genus were from the Late Miocene, less than 10 million years ago. This coincides with a period in which many modern genera of birds became recognizable in the fossil record. As of 2021, the oldest falconid fossil is estimated to be 55 million years old. Given the distribution of fossil and living \"Falco\" taxa, falcons are probably of North American, African, or possibly Middle Eastern or European origin. Falcons are not closely related to other birds of prey, and their nearest relatives are parrots and songbirds.\nOverview.\nFalcons are roughly divisible into three or four groups. The first contains the kestrels (probably excepting the American kestrel); usually small and stocky falcons of mainly brown upperside colour and sometimes sexually dimorphic; three African species that are generally gray in colour stand apart from the typical members of this group. The fox and greater kestrels can be told apart at first glance by their tail colours, but not by much else; they might be very close relatives and are probably much closer to each other than the lesser and common kestrels. Kestrels feed chiefly on terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of appropriate size, such as rodents, reptiles, or insects.\nThe second group contains slightly larger (on average) species, the hobbies and relatives. These birds are characterized by considerable amounts of dark slate-gray in their plumage; their malar areas are nearly always black. They feed mainly on smaller birds.\nThird are the peregrine falcon and its relatives, variably sized powerful birds that also have a black malar area (except some very light color morphs), and often a black cap, as well. They are very fast birds with a maximum speed of 390 kilometres per hour. Otherwise, they are somewhat intermediate between the other groups, being chiefly medium grey with some lighter or brownish colours on their upper sides. They are, on average, more delicately patterned than the hobbies and, if the hierofalcons are excluded (see below), this group typically contains species with horizontal barring on their undersides. As opposed to the other groups, where tail colour varies much in general but little according to evolutionary relatedness, the tails of the large falcons are quite uniformly dark grey with inconspicuous black banding and small, white tips, though this is probably plesiomorphic. These large \"Falco\" species feed on mid-sized birds and terrestrial vertebrates.\nVery similar to these, and sometimes included therein, are the four or so species of hierofalcon (literally, \"hawk-falcons\"). They represent taxa with, usually, more phaeomelanins, which impart reddish or brown colors, and generally more strongly patterned plumage reminiscent of hawks. Their undersides have a lengthwise pattern of blotches, lines, or arrowhead marks.\nWhile these three or four groups, loosely circumscribed, are an informal arrangement, they probably contain several distinct clades in their entirety.\nA study of mtDNA cytochrome \"b\" sequence data of some kestrels identified a clade containing the common kestrel and related \"malar-striped\" species, to the exclusion of such taxa as the greater kestrel (which lacks a malar stripe), the lesser kestrel (which is very similar to the common, but also has no malar stripe), and the American kestrel, which has a malar stripe, but its colour pattern \u2013 apart from the brownish back \u2013 and also the black feathers behind the ear, which never occur in the true kestrels, are more reminiscent of some hobbies. The malar-striped kestrels apparently split from their relatives in the Gelasian, roughly 2.0\u20132.5 million years ago (Mya), and are seemingly of tropical East African origin. The entire \"true kestrel\" group\u2014excluding the American species\u2014is probably a distinct and quite young clade, as also suggested by their numerous apomorphies.\nOther studies have confirmed that the hierofalcon are a monophyletic group\u2013and that hybridization is quite frequent at least in the larger falcon species. Initial studies of mtDNA cytochrome \"b\" sequence data suggested that the hierofalcon are basal among living falcons. The discovery of a NUMT proved this earlier theory erroneous. In reality, the hierofalcon are a rather young group, originating at the same time as the start of the main kestrel radiation, about 2 Mya. Very little fossil history exists for this lineage. However, the present diversity of very recent origin suggests that this lineage may have nearly gone extinct in the recent past.\nThe phylogeny and delimitations of the peregrine and hobby groups are more problematic. Molecular studies have only been conducted on a few species, and the morphologically ambiguous taxa have often been little researched. The morphology of the syrinx, which contributes well to resolving the overall phylogeny of the Falconidae, is not very informative in the present genus. Nonetheless, a core group containing the peregrine and Barbary falcons, which, in turn, group with the hierofalcon and the more distant prairie falcon (which was sometimes placed with the hierofalcon, though it is entirely distinct biogeographically), as well as at least most of the \"typical\" hobbies, are confirmed to be monophyletic as suspected.\nGiven that the American \"Falco\" species of today belong to the peregrine group, or are apparently more basal species, the initially most successful evolutionary radiation seemingly was a Holarctic one that originated possibly around central Eurasia or in (northern) Africa. One or several lineages were present in North America by the Early Pliocene at latest.\nThe origin of today's major \"Falco\" groups\u2014the \"typical\" hobbies and kestrels, for example, or the peregrine-hierofalcon complex, or the aplomado falcon lineage\u2014can be quite confidently placed from the Miocene-Pliocene boundary through the Zanclean and Piacenzian and just into the Gelasian, that is from 2.4 to 5.3 Mya, when the malar-striped kestrels diversified. Some groups of falcons, such as the hierofalcon complex and the peregrine-Barbary superspecies, have only evolved in more recent times; the species of the former seem to be 120,000 years old or so.\nSpecies.\nThe sequence follows the taxonomic order of White \"et al.\" (1996), except for adjustments in the kestrel sequence.\nFossil record.\nSeveral more paleosubspecies of extant species also been described; see species accounts for these.\n\"\"Sushkinia\" pliocaena\" from the Early Pliocene of Pavlodar (Kazakhstan) appears to be a falcon of some sort. It might belong in this genus or a closely related one. In any case, the genus name \"Sushkinia\" is invalid for this animal because it had already been allocated to a prehistoric dragonfly relative. In 2015 the bird genus was renamed \"Psushkinia\".\nThe supposed \"\"Falco\" pisanus\" was actually a pigeon of the genus \"Columba\", possibly the same as \"Columba omnisanctorum\", which, in that case, would adopt the older species name of the \"falcon\". The Eocene fossil \"\"Falco\" falconellus\" (or \"\"F.\" falconella\") from Wyoming is a bird of uncertain affiliations, maybe a falconid, maybe not; it certainly does not belong in this genus. \"\"Falco\" readei\" is now considered a paleosubspecies of the yellow-headed caracara (\"Milvago chimachima\").\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition to speed and strength, these predators have keen eyesight for detecting prey from a distance or during flight, strong feet with sharp talons for grasping or killing prey, and powerful, curved beaks for tearing off flesh. Although predatory birds primarily hunt live prey, many species (such as fish eagles, vultures and condors) also scavenge and eat carrion.\nAlthough the term \"bird of prey\" could theoretically be taken to include all birds that actively hunt and eat other animals, ornithologists typically use the narrower definition followed in this page, excluding many piscivorous predators such as storks, cranes, herons, gulls, skuas, penguins, and kingfishers, as well as many primarily insectivorous birds such as nightjars, frogmouths, and some passerines (e.g. shrikes); omnivorous passerine birds such as crows and ravens; and opportunistic predators from predominantly frugivorous or herbivorous ratites such as cassowaries and rheas. Some extinct predatory telluravian birds had talons similar to those of modern birds of prey, including mousebird relatives (Sandcoleidae), and Messelasturidae indicating possible common descent. Some Enantiornithes also had such talons, indicating possible convergent evolution, as enanthiornithines are not considered to be true modern birds.\nCommon names.\nThe term \"raptor\" is derived from the Latin word , meaning \"to seize or take by force\". The common names for various birds of prey are based on structure, but many of the traditional names do not reflect the evolutionary relationships between the groups.\nMany of these English language group names originally referred to particular species encountered in Britain. As English-speaking people travelled further, the familiar names were applied to new birds with similar characteristics. Names that have generalised this way include; kite, \"Milvus milvus\", sparrowhawk or sparhawk, \"Accipiter nisus\", goshawk, \"Accipiter gentilis\", kestrel, \"Falco tinninculus\", hobby, \"Falco subbuteo\", harrier, simplified from \"hen-harrier\", \"Circus cyaneus\", buzzard, \"Buteo buteo\".\nSome names have not generalised and refer to single species or groups of closely related subspecies, such as the merlin, \"Falco columbarius\".\nSystematics.\nHistorical classifications.\nThe taxonomy of Carl Linnaeus grouped birds (class Aves) into orders, genera, and species, with no formal ranks between genus and order. He placed all birds of prey into a single order, \"Accipitres\", subdividing this into four genera: \"Vultur\" (vultures), \"Falco\" (eagles, hawks, falcons, etc.), \"Strix\" (owls), and \"Lanius\" (shrikes). This approach was followed by subsequent authors such as Gmelin, Latham and Turton.\nLouis Pierre Vieillot used additional ranks: order, tribe, family, genus, species. Birds of prey (order Accipitres) were divided into diurnal and nocturnal tribes; the owls remained monogeneric (family \u00c6golii, genus \"Strix\"), whilst the diurnal raptors were divided into three families: Vulturini, Gypa\u00ebti, and Accipitrini. Thus Vieillot's families were similar to the Linnaean genera, with the difference that shrikes were no longer included amongst the birds of prey. In addition to the original \"Vultur\" and \"Falco\" (now reduced in scope), Vieillot adopted four genera from Savigny: \"Phene\", \"Hali\u00e6etus\", \"Pandion\", and \"Elanus\". He also introduced five new genera of vultures (\"Gypagus\", \"Catharista\", \"Daptrius\", \"Ibycter\", \"Polyborus\") and eleven new genera of accipitrines (\"Aquila\", \"Circa\u00ebtus\", \"Circus\", \"Buteo\", \"Milvus\", \"Ictinia\", \"Physeta\", \"Harpia\", \"Spiza\u00ebtus\", \"Asturina\", \"Sparvius\").\nFalconimorphae is a deprecated superorder within Raptores, formerly composed of the orders Falconiformes and Strigiformes. The clade was invalidated after 2012. Falconiformes is now placed in Eufalconimorphae, while Strigiformes is placed in Afroaves.\nModern systematics.\nThe order Accipitriformes is believed to have originated 44\u00a0million years ago when it split from the common ancestor of the secretarybird (\"Sagittarius serpentarius\") and the accipitrid species. The phylogeny of Accipitriformes is complex and difficult to unravel. Widespread paraphylies were observed in many phylogenetic studies. More recent and detailed studies show similar results. However, according to the findings of a 2014 study, the sister relationship between larger clades of Accipitriformes was well supported (e.g. relationship of \"Harpagus\" kites to buzzards and sea eagles and these latter two with \"Accipiter\" hawks are sister taxa of the clade containing Aquilinae and Harpiinae).\nThe diurnal birds of prey are formally classified into six families of two different orders (Accipitriformes and Falconiformes).\nThese families were traditionally grouped together in a single order Falconiformes but are now split into two orders, the Falconiformes and Accipitriformes. The Cathartidae are sometimes placed in a separate order Cathartiformes. Formerly, they were sometimes placed in the order Ciconiiformes.\nThe secretary bird and/or osprey are sometimes listed as subfamilies of Acciptridae: Sagittariinae and Pandioninae, respectively.\nAustralia's letter-winged kite is a member of the family Accipitridae, although it is a nocturnal bird.\nThe nocturnal birds of prey\u2014the owls\u2014are classified separately as members of two extant families of the order Strigiformes:\nPhylogeny.\nBelow is a simplified phylogeny of Telluraves which is the clade where the birds of prey belong to along with passerines and several near-passerine lineages. The orders in bold text are birds of prey orders; this is to show the paraphyly of the group as well as their relationships to other birds.\nA recent phylogenomic study from Wu et al. (2024) has found an alternative phylogeny for the placement of the birds of prey. Their analysis has found support in a clade consisting of the Strigiformes and Accipitriformes in new clade Hieraves. Hieraves was also recovered to be the sister clade to Australaves (which it includes the Cariamiformes and Falconiformes along with Psittacopasserae). Below is their phylogeny from the study.\nPossible inclusion of Cariamiformes.\nCariamiformes is an order of telluravian birds consisting of the living seriemas and extinct terror birds. Jarvis et al. 2014 suggested including them in the category of birds of prey, and McClure et al. 2019 considered seriemas to be birds of prey. The Peregrine Fund also considers seriemas to be birds of prey. Like most birds of prey, seriemas and terror birds prey on vertebrates.\nHowever, seriemas were not traditionally considered birds of prey, and they are still not considered birds of prey in general parlance. They were traditionally classified in the order Gruiformes, but later research has reclassified them into Cariamiformes.\nThe bodies of seriemas are also shaped somewhat differently from birds of prey. Their legs and necks are significantly longer than those of typical raptors, although the secretarybirds (traditionally considered raptors) also have comparably long legs. The beaks of seriemas are hooked (as in raptors), but are longer than those of typical raptors.\nMigration.\nMigratory behaviour evolved multiple times within accipitrid raptors.\nThe earliest event occurred nearly 14 to 12\u00a0million years ago. This result seems to be one of the oldest dates published so far in the case of birds of prey. For example, a previous reconstruction of migratory behaviour in one \"Buteo\" clade with a result of the origin of migration around 5\u00a0million years ago was also supported by that study.\nMigratory species of raptors may have had a southern origin because it seems that all of the major lineages within Accipitridae had an origin in one of the biogeographic realms of the Southern Hemisphere. The appearance of migratory behaviour occurred in the tropics parallel with the range expansion of migratory species to temperate habitats. Similar results of southern origin in other taxonomic groups can be found in the literature.\nDistribution and biogeographic history highly determine the origin of migration in birds of prey. Based on some comparative analyses, diet breadth also has an effect on the evolution of migratory behaviour in this group, but its relevance needs further investigation. The evolution of migration in animals seems to be a complex and difficult topic with many unanswered questions.\nA recent study discovered new connections between migration and the ecology, life history of raptors. A brief overview from abstract of the published paper shows that \"clutch size and hunting strategies have been proved to be the most important variables in shaping distribution areas, and also the geographic dissimilarities may mask important relationships between life history traits and migratory behaviours. The West Palearctic-Afrotropical and the North-South American migratory systems are fundamentally different from the East Palearctic-Indomalayan system, owing to the presence versus absence of ecological barriers.\" Maximum entropy modelling can help in answering the question: why species winters at one location while the others are elsewhere. Temperature and precipitation related factors differ in the limitation of species distributions. \"This suggests that the migratory behaviours differ among the three main migratory routes for these species\" which may have important conservational consequences in the protection of migratory raptors.\nSexual dimorphism.\nBirds of prey (raptors) are known to display patterns of sexual dimorphism. It is commonly believed that the dimorphisms found in raptors occur due to sexual selection or environmental factors. In general, hypotheses in favor of ecological factors being the cause for sexual dimorphism in raptors are rejected. This is because the ecological model is less parsimonious, meaning that its explanation is more complex than that of the sexual selection model. Additionally, ecological models are much harder to test because a great deal of data is required.\nDimorphisms can also be the product of intrasexual selection between males and females. It appears that both sexes of the species play a role in the sexual dimorphism within raptors; females tend to compete with other females to find good places to nest and attract males, and males competing with other males for adequate hunting ground so they appear as the most healthy mate.\nIt has also been proposed that sexual dimorphism is merely the product of disruptive selection, and is merely a stepping stone in the process of speciation, especially if the traits that define gender are independent across a species. Sexual dimorphism can be viewed as something that can accelerate the rate of speciation.\nIn non-predatory birds, males are typically larger than females. However, in birds of prey, the opposite is the case. For instance, the kestrel is a type of falcon in which males are the primary providers, and the females are responsible for nurturing the young. In this species, the smaller the kestrels are, the less food is needed and thus, they can survive in environments that are harsher. This is particularly true in the male kestrels. It has become more energetically favorable for male kestrels to remain smaller than their female counterparts because smaller males have an agility advantage when it comes to defending the nest and hunting. Larger females are favored because they can incubate larger numbers of offspring, while also being able to brood a larger clutch size.\nOlfaction.\nIt is a long-standing belief that birds lack any sense of smell, but it has become clear that many birds do have functional olfactory systems. Despite this, most raptors are still considered to primarily rely on vision, with raptor vision being extensively studied. A 2020 review of the existing literature combining anatomical, genetic, and behavioural studies showed that, in general, raptors have functional olfactory systems that they are likely to use in a range of different contexts.\nPersecution.\nBirds of prey have been historically persecuted both directly and indirectly. In the Danish Faroe Islands, there were rewards \"Naebbetold\" (by royal decree from 1741) given in return for the bills of birds of prey shown by hunters. In Britain, kites and buzzards were seen as destroyers of game and killed, for instance in 1684\u20135 alone as many as 100 kites were killed. Rewards for their killing were also in force in the Netherlands from 1756. From 1705 to 1800, it has been estimated that 624087 birds of prey were killed in a part of Germany that included Hannover, Luneburg, Lauenburg and Bremen with 14125 claws deposited just in 1796\u201397. Many species also develop lead poisoning after accidental consumption of lead shot when feeding on animals that had been shot by hunters. Lead pellets from direct shooting that the birds have escaped from also cause reduced fitness and premature deaths.\nAttacks on humans.\nSome evidence supports the contention that the African crowned eagle occasionally views human children as prey, with a witness account of one attack (in which the victim, a seven-year-old boy, survived and the eagle was killed), and the discovery of part of a human child skull in a nest. This would make it the only living bird known to prey on humans, although other birds such as ostriches and cassowaries have killed humans in self-defense and a lammergeier might have killed Aeschylus by accident. Many stories of Brazilian indigenous peoples speak about children mauled by Uiruuet\u00ea, the Harpy Eagle in Tupi language. Various large raptors like golden eagles are reported attacking human beings, but its unclear if they intend to eat them or if they have ever been successful in killing one.\nSome fossil evidence indicates large birds of prey occasionally preyed on prehistoric hominids. The Taung Child, an early human found in Africa, is believed to have been killed by an eagle-like bird similar to the crowned eagle. The Haast's eagle may have preyed on early humans in New Zealand, and this conclusion would be consistent with Maori folklore. \"Leptoptilos robustus\" might have preyed on both \"Homo floresiensis\" and anatomically modern humans, and the Malagasy crowned eagle, teratorns, Woodward's eagle and \"Caracara major\" are similar in size to the Haast's eagle, implying that they similarly could pose a threat to a human being.\nVision.\nBirds of prey have incredible vision and rely heavily on it for a number of tasks. They utilize their high visual acuity to obtain food, navigate their surroundings, distinguish and flee from predators, mating, nest construction, and much more. They accomplish these tasks with a large eye in relation to their skull, which allows for a larger image to be projected onto the retina. The visual acuity of some large raptors such as eagles and Old World vultures are the highest known among vertebrates; the wedge-tailed eagle has twice the visual acuity of a typical human and six times that of the common ostrich, which possess the largest eyes of any terrestrial animal.\nThere are two regions in the retina, called the deep and shallow fovea, that are specialized for acute vision. These regions contain the highest density of photoreceptors, and provide the highest points of visual acuity. The deep fovea points forward at an approximate 45\u00b0 angle, while the shallow fovea points approximately 15\u00b0 to the right or left of the head axis. Several raptor species repeatedly cock their heads into three distinct positions while observing an object. First, is straight ahead with their head pointed towards the object. Second and third are sideways to the right or left of the object, with their head axis positioned approximately 40\u00b0 adjacent to the object. This movement is believed to be associated with lining up the incoming image to fall on the deep fovea. Raptors will choose which head position to use depending on the distance to the object. At distances as close as 8m, they used primarily binocular vision. At distances greater than 21m, they spent more time using monocular vision. At distances greater than 40m, they spent 80% or more time using their monocular vision. This suggests that raptors tilt their head to rely on the highly acute deep fovea.\nLike all birds, raptors possess tetrachromacy, however, due to their emphasis on visual acuity, many diurnal birds of prey have little ability to see ultraviolet light as this produces chromatic aberration which decreases the clarity of vision.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Insulin is released by the pancreas in response to carbohydrates consumed in the diet. In states of insulin resistance, the same amount of insulin does not have the same effect on glucose transport and blood sugar levels. There are many causes of insulin resistance and the underlying process is still not completely understood. Risk factors for insulin resistance include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, various health conditions, and certain medications. Insulin resistance is considered a component of the metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance can be improved or reversed with lifestyle approaches, such as weight reduction, exercise, and dietary changes.\nThere are multiple ways to measure insulin resistance such as fasting insulin levels or glucose tolerance tests, but these are not often used in clinical practice.\nCause.\nRisk factors.\nThere are a number of risk factors for insulin resistance, including being overweight or obese or having a sedentary lifestyle. Various genetic factors can increase risk, such as a family history of diabetes, and there are some specific medical conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as polycystic ovary syndrome.\nThe U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases states that specific risks that may predispose an individual to insulin resistance can include:\nIn addition some medications and other health conditions can raise the risk.\nLifestyle factors.\nDietary factors are likely to contribute to insulin resistance. However, causative foods are difficult to determine given the limitations of nutrition research. Foods that have independently been linked to insulin resistance include those high in sugar with high glycemic indices, low in omega-3 and fiber, and which are hyperpalatable which increases risk of overeating. Overconsumption of fat- and sugar-rich meals and beverages have been proposed as a fundamental factor behind the metabolic syndrome epidemic.\nDiet also has the potential to change the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated phospholipids in cell membranes. The percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is inversely correlated with insulin resistance. It is hypothesized that increasing cell membrane fluidity by increasing PUFA concentration might result in an enhanced number of insulin receptors, an increased affinity of insulin to its receptors, and reduced insulin resistance.\nVitamin D deficiency has also been associated with insulin resistance.\nSedentary lifestyle increases the likelihood of development of insulin resistance. In epidemiological studies, higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%.\nStudies have consistently shown that there is a link between insulin resistance and circadian rhythm, with insulin sensitivity being higher in the morning and lower in the evening. A mismatch between the circadian rhythm and the meals schedule, such as in circadian rhythm disorders, may increase insulin resistance.\nInsufficient sleep has been shown to cause insulin resistance, and also increases the risk of developing metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity.\nMedications.\nSome medications are associated with insulin resistance including corticosteroids, protease inhibitors (type of HIV medication), and atypical antipsychotics.\nExposure to light during sleep.\nBeing exposed to light during sleep has been shown to cause insulin resistance and increase heart rate.\nHormones.\nMany hormones can induce insulin resistance including cortisol, growth hormone, and human placental lactogen.\nCortisol counteracts insulin and can lead to increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, reduced peripheral utilization of glucose, and increased insulin resistance. It does this by decreasing the translocation of glucose transporters (especially GLUT4) to the cell membrane.\nBased on the significant improvement in insulin sensitivity in humans after bariatric surgery and rats with surgical removal of the duodenum, it has been proposed that some substance is produced in the mucosa of that initial portion of the small intestine that signals body cells to become insulin resistant. If the producing tissue is removed, the signal ceases and body cells revert to normal insulin sensitivity. No such substance has been found as yet, and the existence of such a substance remains speculative.\nLeptin is a hormone produced from the ob gene and adipocytes. Its physiological role is to regulate hunger by alerting the body when it is full. Studies show that lack of leptin causes severe obesity and is strongly linked with insulin resistance.\nDiseases.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are associated with insulin resistance. Hepatitis C also makes people three to four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.\nMitochondrial dysfunction.\nMultiple studies involving different methodology suggest that impaired function of mitochondria might play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Mitochondrial dysfunction may result from the formation of reactive oxygen species, genetic factors, aging, and reduced mitochondrial biogenesis. Important questions remain unsolved to date, however. If confirmed by rigorous studies, a link between mitochondrial disorders and reduced insulin sensitivity might pave the way to new therapeutic approaches.\nInflammation.\nAcute or chronic inflammation, such as in infections, can cause insulin resistance. TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine that may promote insulin resistance by promoting lipolysis, disrupting insulin signaling, and reducing the expression of GLUT4.\nGenetics.\nSeveral genetic loci have been identified as associated with insulin insensitivity. These include variations in loci near the NAT2, GCKR, and IGFI genes, which are linked to insulin resistance. Further research has indicated that loci near these genes are correlated with insulin resistance. However, it is estimated that these loci only account for 25\u201344% of the genetic component of insulin resistance.\nPathophysiology.\nIn normal metabolism, the elevated blood glucose instructs beta (\u03b2) cells in the Islets of Langerhans, located in the pancreas, to release insulin into the blood. The insulin makes insulin-sensitive tissues in the body (primarily skeletal muscle cells, adipose tissue, and liver) absorb glucose which provides energy as well as lowers blood glucose. The beta cells reduce insulin output as the blood glucose level falls, allowing blood glucose to settle at a constant of approximately 5\u00a0mmol/L (90\u00a0mg/dL). In an \"insulin-resistant\" person, normal levels of insulin do not have the same effect in controlling blood glucose levels.\nWhen the body produces insulin under conditions of insulin resistance, the cells are unable to absorb or use it as effectively and it stays in the bloodstream. Certain cell types such as fat and muscle cells require insulin to absorb glucose and when these cells fail to respond adequately to circulating insulin, blood glucose levels rise. The liver normally helps regulate glucose levels by reducing its secretion of glucose in the presence of insulin. However, in insulin resistance, this normal reduction in the liver's glucose production may not occur, further contributing to elevated blood glucose.\nInsulin resistance in fat cells results in reduced uptake of circulating lipids and increased hydrolysis of stored triglycerides. This leads to elevated free fatty acids in the blood plasma and can further worsen insulin resistance. Since insulin is the primary hormonal signal for energy storage into fat cells, which tend to retain their sensitivity in the face of hepatic and skeletal muscle resistance, insulin resistance stimulates the formation of new fatty tissue and accelerates weight gain. Brain cells also require insulin, such that insulin resistance in the brain is implicated in neurodegenerative disease. (Although insulin does not cross the blood-brain barrier natively, it can do so by carrier-mediated transport systems.)\nIn states of insulin resistance, beta cells in the pancreas increase their production of insulin. This causes high blood insulin (hyperinsulinemia) to compensate for the high blood glucose. During this compensated phase of insulin resistance, beta cell function is upregulated, insulin levels are higher, and blood glucose levels are still maintained. If compensatory insulin secretion fails, then either fasting (impaired fasting glucose) or postprandial (impaired glucose tolerance) glucose concentrations increase. Eventually, type 2 diabetes occurs when glucose levels become higher as the resistance increases and compensatory insulin secretion fails. The inability of the \u03b2-cells to produce sufficient insulin in a condition of hyperglycemia is what characterizes the transition from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. Although insulin resistance is generally thought to precede hyperglycemia, hyperglycemia promotes insulin resistance (a bidirectional relationship).\nInsulin resistance is strongly associated with intestinal-derived apoB-48 production rate in insulin-resistant subjects and type 2 diabetics. Insulin resistance often is found in people with visceral adiposity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia involving elevated triglycerides, small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) particles, and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. With respect to visceral adiposity, a great deal of evidence suggests two strong links with insulin resistance. First, unlike subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose cells produce significant amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and Interleukins-1 and \u22126, etc. In numerous experimental models, these proinflammatory cytokines disrupt normal insulin action in fat and muscle cells and may be a major factor in causing the whole-body insulin resistance observed in patients with visceral adiposity. Much of the attention on production of proinflammatory cytokines has focused on the IKK-beta/NF-kappa-B pathway, a protein network that enhances transcription of inflammatory markers and mediators that may cause insulin resistance. Second, visceral adiposity is related to an accumulation of fat in the liver, a condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The result of NAFLD is an excessive release of free fatty acids into the bloodstream (due to increased lipolysis), and an increase in hepatic breakdown of glycogen stores into glucose (glycogenolysis), both of which have the effect of exacerbating peripheral insulin resistance and increasing the likelihood of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nThe excessive expansion of adipose tissue that tends to occur under sustainedly positive energy balance (as in overeating) has been postulated by Vidal-Puig to induce lipotoxic and inflammatory effects that may contribute to causing insulin resistance and its accompanying disease states.\nAlso, insulin resistance often is associated with a hypercoagulable state (impaired fibrinolysis) and increased inflammatory cytokine levels. \nMolecular mechanism.\nAt the molecular level, a cell senses insulin through insulin receptors, with the signal propagating through a signaling cascade collectively known as PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Recent studies suggested that the pathway may operate as a bistable switch under physiologic conditions for certain types of cells, and insulin response may well be a threshold phenomenon. The pathway's sensitivity to insulin may be blunted by many factors such as lipolysis of free fatty acids, causing insulin resistance. From a broader perspective, however, sensitivity tuning (including sensitivity reduction) is a common practice for an organism to adapt to the changing environment or metabolic conditions. Pregnancy, for example, entails significant metabolic changes, during which the mother must decrease the insulin sensitivity of her muscles to conserve more glucose for both the maternal and fetal brains. This adaptation can occur by elevating the response threshold, thereby delaying the onset of sensitivity. This is achieved through the secretion of placental growth factor, which interferes with the interaction between insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and PI3K. This concept forms the basis of the adjustable threshold hypothesis of insulin resistance.\nInsulin resistance has been proposed to be a reaction to excess nutrition by superoxide dismutase in cell mitochondria that acts as an antioxidant defense mechanism. This link seems to exist under diverse causes of insulin resistance. It also is based on the finding that insulin resistance may be reversed rapidly by exposing cells to mitochondrial uncouplers, electron transport chain inhibitors, or mitochondrial superoxide dismutase mimetics.\nDiagnosis.\nGlucose tolerance testing.\nDuring a glucose tolerance test (GTT), which may be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus, a fasting patient takes a 75\u00a0gram oral dose of glucose. Then blood glucose levels are measured over the following two hours.\nInterpretation is based on WHO guidelines. After two hours a glycemia less than 7.8\u00a0mmol/L (140\u00a0mg/dL) is considered normal, a glycemia of between 7.8 and 11.0\u00a0mmol/L (140 to 197\u00a0mg/dL) is considered as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and a glycemia of greater than or equal to 11.1\u00a0mmol/L (200\u00a0mg/dL) is considered diabetes mellitus.\nAn oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) may be normal or mildly abnormal in simple insulin resistance. Often, there are raised glucose levels in the early measurements, reflecting the loss of a postprandial peak (after the meal) in insulin production. Extension of the testing (for several more hours) may reveal a hypoglycemic \"dip,\" that is a result of an overshoot in insulin production after the failure of the physiologic postprandial insulin response.\nFasting insulin levels.\nA fasting serum insulin level greater than 29 microIU/mL or 174 pmol/L indicates insulin resistance. The same levels apply three hours after the last meal.\nHyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.\nThe gold standard for investigating and quantifying insulin resistance is the \"hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp,\" so-called because it measures the amount of glucose necessary to compensate for an increased insulin level without causing hypoglycemia. It is a type of glucose clamp technique. The test is rarely performed in clinical care, but is used in medical research, for example, to assess the effects of different medications. The rate of glucose infusion commonly is referred to in diabetes literature as the GINF value.\nThe procedure takes about two hours. Through a peripheral vein, insulin is infused at 10\u2013120 mU per m2 per minute. In order to compensate for the insulin infusion, glucose 20% is infused to maintain blood sugar levels between 5 and 5.5\u00a0mmol/L. The rate of glucose infusion is determined by checking the blood sugar levels every five to ten minutes.\nThe insulin sensitivity is determined by the rate of glucose infusion during the last thirty minutes of the test. If high levels (7.5\u00a0mg/min or higher) are needed, the patient is considered insulin-sensitive. Conversely, very low levels (4.0\u00a0mg/min or lower) indicate insulin resistance. Levels falling between 4.0 and 7.5\u00a0mg/min are not conclusive and suggest \"impaired glucose tolerance,\" which is an early indication of insulin resistance.\nThis fundamental technique can be greatly enhanced through the utilization of glucose tracers. Glucose can be labeled with either stable or radioactive atoms. Commonly employed tracers include 3-3H glucose (radioactive), 6,6 2H-glucose (stable), and 1-13C glucose (stable). Prior to initiating the hyperinsulinemic phase, a 3-hour tracer infusion allows for the determination of the basal rate of glucose production. Throughout the clamp, the plasma tracer concentrations facilitate the computation of whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism, as well as the production of glucose by the body. (i.e., endogenous glucose production).\nModified insulin suppression test.\nAnother measure of insulin resistance is the modified insulin suppression test developed by Gerald Reaven at Stanford University. The test correlates well with the euglycemic clamp, with less operator-dependent error. This test has been used to advance the large body of research relating to the metabolic syndrome.\nPatients initially receive 25 \u03bcg of octreotide (Sandostatin) in 5 mL of normal saline over 3 to 5 minutes via intravenous infusion (IV) as an initial bolus, and then, are infused continuously with an intravenous infusion of somatostatin (0.27 \u03bcg/m2/min) to suppress endogenous insulin and glucose secretion. Next, insulin and 20% glucose are infused at rates of 32 and 267\u00a0mg/m2/min, respectively. Blood glucose is checked at zero, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, and thereafter, every 10 minutes for the last half-hour of the test. These last four values are averaged to determine the steady-state plasma glucose level (SSPG). Subjects with an SSPG greater than 150\u00a0mg/dL are considered to be insulin-resistant.\nStatic function tests.\nGiven the complicated nature of the \"clamp\" technique (and the potential dangers of hypoglycemia in some patients), alternatives have been sought to simplify the measurement of insulin resistance. The first was the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA), and more recent methods include the Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and SPINA-GR, a measure for insulin sensitivity. All of these calculated markers employ fasting insulin and glucose levels to calculate insulin resistance, and all correlate reasonably with the results of clamping studies.\nInsulin resistance and aging.\nInsulin resistance normally increases with ageing in human adults, whereas insulin sensitivity is maintained in centenarians and familial human longevity. Greater longevity in shorter men is associated with reduced insulin resistance.\nChronic systemic inflammation increases with aging in human adults, and is associated with many aging-associated diseases. A vicious circle exists between aging and chronic inflammation.\nPrevention and management.\nMaintaining a healthy body weight and engaging in regular physical activity can help mitigate the risk of developing insulin resistance.\nThe primary treatment for insulin resistance is exercise and weight loss. Both metformin and thiazolidinediones improve insulin sensitivity. Metformin is approved for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and has become one of the more commonly prescribed medications for insulin resistance.\nThe \"Diabetes Prevention Program\" (DPP) showed that exercise and diet were nearly twice as effective as metformin at reducing the risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes. However, the participants in the DPP trial regained about 40% of the weight that they had lost at the end of 2.8 years, resulting in a similar incidence of diabetes development in both the lifestyle intervention and the control arms of the trial. In epidemiological studies, higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%.\nFurthermore, physical training has also generally been seen to be an effective antagonist of insulin resistance in obese or overweight children and adolescents (under the age of 19).\nAerobic or resistance training.\nAs per the 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Marson et al., aerobic exercise is associated with fasting insulin reduction; however, resistance and combined exercise are not. The authors caution against underestimating the importance of resistance and combined exercise, as this type of training is generally less researched than aerobic training. Overall, physical training can be used in both adolescents and adults to prevent the progression of insulin resistance and future possible metabolic and cardiovascular disease.\nFood constituents.\nResistant starch from high-amylose corn, amylomaize, has been shown to reduce insulin resistance in healthy individuals, in individuals with insulin resistance, and in individuals with type 2 diabetes.\nSome types of polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3) may moderate the progression of insulin resistance into type 2 diabetes, however, omega-3 fatty acids appear to have limited ability to reverse insulin resistance, and they cease to be efficacious once type 2 diabetes is established.\nHistory.\nThe concept that insulin resistance may be the underlying cause of diabetes mellitus type 2 was first advanced by Professor Wilhelm Falta and published in Vienna in 1931, and confirmed as contributory by Sir Harold Percival Himsworth of the University College Hospital Medical Centre in London in 1936; however, type 2 diabetes does not occur unless there is concurrent failure of compensatory insulin secretion.\nAdaptive explanations.\nSome scholars go as far as to claim that neither insulin resistance, nor obesity really are metabolic disorders \"per se\", but simply adaptive responses to sustained caloric surplus, intended to protect bodily organs from lipotoxicity (unsafe levels of lipids in the bloodstream and tissues): \"Obesity should therefore not be regarded as a pathology or disease, but rather as the normal, physiologic response to sustained caloric surplus... As a consequence of the high level of lipid accumulation in insulin target tissues including skeletal muscle and liver, it has been suggested that exclusion of glucose from lipid-laden cells is a compensatory defense against further accumulation of lipogenic substrate.\"\nOther prevailing thoughts that insulin resistance can be an evolutionary adaptation include the thrifty gene hypothesis. This hypothesis raises the point that if there is a genetic component to insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, these phenotypes should be selected against. Yet, there has been an increase in mean insulin resistance in both the normoglycemic population as well as the diabetic population.\nJ.V. Neel posits that in ancient human ancestors, during periods of heightened famine, genes facilitating increased glucose storage would have conferred an advantage. However, in today's modern environment, this is no longer the case.\nEvidence contradicts Neel's hypothesis in studies of the Pima Indians, which suggest that individuals with higher insulin sensitivity tended to have higher weights, whereas those with insulin resistance tended to weigh less on average within this demographic.\nModern hypotheses propose that insulin metabolism serves as a socio-ecological adaptation, with insulin serving as the mechanism for allocating energy to different body components and insulin sensitivity being an adaptation to regulate this energy allocation. The Behavioral Switch Hypothesis suggests that insulin resistance leads to two methods of altering reproductive and behavioral strategies. These strategies are termed \"r to K\" and \"soldier to diplomat\". The \"r to K\" strategy involves directing insulin through the placenta to the fetus, resulting in weight gain in the fetus but not the mother, indicating an increase in parental investment (K strategy). In the \"soldier to diplomat\" strategy, the insensitivity of skeletal muscle to insulin could redirect glucose to the brain, which does not require insulin receptors. This has been shown to enhance cognitive development across various studies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Later, he toured Europe numerous times from his long-standing base in London. It was on one of these occasions, in 1781, that he engaged in a piano competition with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\nInfluenced by Domenico Scarlatti's harpsichord school and Joseph Haydn's classical school and by the \"stile Galante\" of Johann Christian Bach and Ignazio Cirri, Clementi developed a fluent and technical legato style, which he passed on to a generation of pianists, including John Field, Johann Baptist Cramer, Ignaz Moscheles, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Friedrich Kalkbrenner, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, and Carl Czerny. He was a notable influence on Ludwig van Beethoven and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin.\nClementi also produced and promoted his own brand of pianos and was a notable music publisher. Because of this activity, many compositions by Clementi's contemporaries and earlier artists have stayed in the repertoire. Though the reputation of Clementi was exceeded only by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Gioachino Rossini in his day, his popularity languished for much of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nLife.\nChildhood.\nMuzio Filippo Vincenzo Francesco Saverio Clementi (baptised Mutius Philippus Vincentius Franciscus Xaverius) was born in Rome in the Papal States on 23 January 1752, and baptised the following day at San Lorenzo in Damaso. He was the eldest of the seven children of Nicol\u00f2 Clementi, a silversmith, and Madalena, n\u00e9e\u00a0Caisar (Magdalena Kaiser). Nicol\u00f2 soon recognised Muzio's musical talent and arranged for private musical instruction with a relative, Antonio Baroni, the maestro di cappella at St Peter's Basilica.\nEducation.\nAt the age of seven, Clementi began studies in figured bass with the organist S. Giovanni Cordicelli, followed by voice lessons from Giuseppe Santarelli. A few years later, probably when he was 11 or 12, he was given counterpoint lessons by Gaetano Carpani. By the age of 13, Clementi had already composed an oratorio, \"Martirio de' gloriosi Santi Giuliano e Celso\", and a mass. When he was 14, in January 1766, he became organist of the parish church of San Lorenzo in D\u00e1maso.\nMove to England.\nIn 1766 Sir Peter Beckford, a wealthy Englishman, nephew of William Beckford (twice Lord Mayor of London, and father of the novelist William Beckford), visited Rome. He was impressed by the young Clementi's musical talent and negotiated with his father to take him to his estate, Stepleton House, north of Blandford Forum in Dorset, England. Beckford agreed to provide quarterly payments to sponsor the boy's musical education until he reached the age of 21. In return, he was expected to provide musical entertainment. For the next seven years, Clementi lived, performed, and studied at the estate in Dorset. During this period, it appears, Clementi spent eight hours a day at the harpsichord, practising and studying the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, George Frideric Handel, Arcangelo Corelli, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, and Bernardo Pasquini. His only compositions dated to this period are the Sonatas Op. 13 and 14 and the \"Sei Sonate per clavicembalo o pianoforte\", Op. 1.\nIn 1770, Clementi made his first public performance as an organist. The audience was reported to be impressed with his playing, thus beginning one of the outstandingly successful concert pianist careers of the period.\nIn 1774, Clementi was freed from his obligations to Peter Beckford. During the winter of 1774\u20131775, he moved to London, making his first appearance as a harpsichordist in a benefit concert on 3 April 1775. He made several public appearances in London as a solo harpsichordist at benefit concerts for two local musicians, a singer and a harpist, and served as conductor (from the keyboard) at the King's Theatre (now His Majesty's Theatre), Haymarket, for at least part of this time.\nMozart.\nClementi started a three-year European tour in 1780, travelling to Paris, where he performed for Queen Marie Antoinette; Munich, Germany; and Salzburg, Austria. In Vienna, he agreed to enter a musical contest with Mozart for the entertainment of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and his guests on 24 December 1781, at the Viennese court. The composers were called upon to improvise and to perform selections from their own compositions. The Emperor diplomatically declared a tie.\nOn 12 January 1782, Mozart reported to his father: \"Clementi plays well, as far as execution with the right-hand goes. His greatest strength lies in his passages in 3rds. Apart from that, he has not a kreuzer's worth of taste or feeling \u2013 in short, he is a mere mechanic.\" In a subsequent letter, he wrote: \"Clementi is a charlatan, like all Italians. He marks a piece presto but plays only allegro.\"\nClementi's impressions of Mozart, by contrast, were enthusiastic. Much later, the pianist Ludwig Berger recalled him saying of Mozart: \"Until then I had never heard anyone play with such spirit and grace. I was particularly overwhelmed by an adagio and by several of his extempore variations for which the Emperor had chosen the theme, and which we were to devise alternately.\"\nDespite later attempts to portray the two as rivals, there is no evidence that their meeting was not cordial. At the time, Clementi was exploring a more virtuosic and flamboyant style, and this might explain Mozart's disparaging attitude. One of the pieces he performed was his Op. 11 toccata, a display piece full of parallel thirds. It would appear that Mozart's opinion might later have changed somewhat. As noted by Hermann Abert in his 1920 biography \"W. A. Mozart\", the set of variations K. 500 of 1786 \"includes a handful of novel pianistic effects that are foreign to Mozart's earlier style and that clearly reflect the influence of Clementi\".\nMozart used the opening motif of Clementi's B-flat major sonata (Op. 24, No. 2) in his overture for \"The Magic Flute\". It was not unusual for composers to borrow from one another, and this might be considered a compliment. Though Clementi noted in subsequent publications of his sonata that it had been written ten years before Mozart's opera\u2014presumably to make clear who was borrowing from whom\u2014Clementi retained an admiration for Mozart, as reflected in the large number of transcriptions he made of Mozart's music, among which is a piano solo version of the \"Magic Flute\" overture.\nTeaching.\nFrom 1783, and for the next twenty years, Clementi stayed in England, playing the piano, conducting, and teaching. Several of his students include Johann Baptist Cramer, Thomas Paul Chipp, Ignaz Moscheles, Therese Jansen Bartolozzi, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Ludwig Berger (who went on to teach Felix Mendelssohn), and John Field (who, in turn, would become a major influence on Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin).\nPublishing and piano manufacturing.\nIn 1798, Clementi took over the firm Longman and Broderip at 26 Cheapside (then the most prestigious shopping street in London), initially with James Longman, who left in 1801. Clementi also had offices at 195 Tottenham Court Road from 1806. The publication line, \"Clementi &amp; Co, &amp; Clementi, Cheapside\" appears on a lithograph, \"Music\" by William Sharp after John Wood (1801\u20131870), circa 1830s.\nClementi also began manufacturing pianos, but on 20 March 1807, a fire destroyed the firm's warehouses in Rotten Road, resulting in a loss of about \u00a340,000. That same year, Clementi made an agreement with Beethoven (one of his greatest admirers), which gave him full publishing rights to all of Beethoven's music in England. He copy edited and interpreted Beethoven's music but has received criticism for editorial work such as making harmonic \"corrections\" to some of Beethoven's scores.\nIn 1810, Clementi stopped performing in order to devote his time to composition and to piano making. On 24 January 1813, together with a group of prominent professional musicians in England, he founded the Philharmonic Society of London, which became the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1912. In 1813, Clementi was appointed a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.\nMeanwhile, his piano business had flourished, affording him an increasingly elegant lifestyle. As an inventor and skilled mechanic, he made important improvements in the construction of the piano, some of which have become standard.\nFinal years.\nAt the end of 1816, Clementi made another trip to the continent to introduce his new works, particularly at the Concerts Spirituels in Paris. He returned to London in June 1818, after stopping off in Frankfurt. In 1821, he once again returned to Paris, conducting his symphonies in Munich and Leipzig. In London in 1824, his symphonies were featured in five of the six programs at the 'Concerts of Ancient and Modern Music' at the King's Theatre.\nIn 1826, Clementi completed his collection of keyboard studies, \"Gradus ad Parnassum\", and set off for Paris with the intention of publishing the third volume of the work simultaneously in Paris, London, and Leipzig. After staying in Baden and most likely making another visit to Italy, he returned to London in the autumn of 1827.\nOn 17 December 1827, a large banquet was organised by Johann Baptist Cramer and Ignaz Moscheles in his honour at the Hotel Albion. Moscheles, in his diary, says that on that occasion, Clementi improvised at the piano on a theme by George Frideric Handel. In 1828, he made his last public appearance at the opening concert of the Philharmonic Society. In 1830, he retired from the Society.\nClementi moved with his wife Emma (n\u00e9e Gisborne) and his family to the outskirts of Lichfield in Staffordshire, and rented Lincroft House on the Earl of Lichfield's Estate from Lady Day 1828 until late 1831. He then moved to Evesham, where he died on 10 March 1832, after a short illness, aged eighty. On 29 March 1832, he was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey. Accompanying his body were three of his students: Johann Baptist Cramer, John Field and Ignaz Moscheles.\nFamily.\nHe had five children; by his first wife, Caroline (n\u00e9e Lehmann), he had a son who died soon after his birth; by his second wife Emma (n\u00e9e Gisborne), whom he married on 6 July 1811 in St Pancras Old Church, he had two sons and two daughters. Among his descendants are the British colonial administrators Sir Cecil Clementi Smith and Sir Cecil Clementi, Air Vice Marshal Cresswell Clementi of the RAF, Sir David Clementi who was a deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Marjorie Clementi (1927\u20131997), a pianist and piano teacher who became Professor of the Piano at the Royal Northern College of Music. Amongst his descendants in Italy was Rodolfo Graziani, Marshal of Italy and Viceroy of Italian Ethiopia in Fascist Italy, who was related to the composer via his mother, Adelia Clementi.\nOne son, the Rev. Vincent Mucius Clementi (1812-1899), a Church of England clergyman, emigrated to Peterborough County, Ontario, where he was incumbent of the Anglican church at Lakefield, Ontario. Two of his sons, Vincent Mutius Clementi (1835\u201372) and Theodore Bold Clementi (1837-1882), were Ontario Provincial Land Surveyors at Peterborough.\nMusic.\nPiano works.\nAs a composer of classical piano sonatas, Clementi was among the first to create keyboard works expressly for the capabilities of the piano. He has been called \"Father of the Piano\".\nOf Clementi's playing in his youth, Moscheles wrote that it was \"marked by a most beautiful legato, a supple touch in lively passages, and a most unfailing technique.\" Mozart may be said to have closed the old\u2014and Clementi to have founded the newer school of technique on the piano.\nClementi composed almost 110 piano sonatas. Some of the earlier and easier ones were later classified as sonatinas after the success of his Sonatinas Op. 36.\nSymphonic works.\nClementi's symphonies are less well known. Though many of his manuscripts have been lost, autograph portions of his unpublished symphonies, which include everything from sketches to complete movements, are in the Library of Congress and the British Library. From these autographs, scholars have been able to reconstruct four symphonies. Clementi also published two symphonies as Op. 18 in 1787, the first in B-flat major and the second in D major. Clementi successfully performed his symphonies in London and other cities in Europe, predominantly from 1813 to 1828. Based on performance reports, scholars estimate that he composed approximately twenty symphonies in total during his life. Clementi used the theme to \"God Save the King\" in his Symphony No. 3 in G major, often called the \"Great National Symphony\", catalogued as WoO 34.\nIn 2002, for the 250th anniversary of his birth, scholars published new research about Clementi's life and works. Ut Orpheus is publishing the 61-volume set of Clementi's complete works, which will include new editions of his symphonies.\nInfluence.\nClementi's influence extended well into the 19th century, with composers using his sonatas as models for their keyboard compositions. Beethoven, in particular, had the highest regard for Clementi. Beethoven often played Clementi sonatas, and often a volume of them was on his music stand. Beethoven recommended these works to many people, including his nephew Karl. A description of Beethoven's regard for Clementi's music can be found in the testimony of his assistant, Anton Schindler, who wrote \"He [Beethoven] had the greatest admiration for these sonatas, considering them the most beautiful, the most pianistic of works, both for their lovely, pleasing, original melodies and for the consistent, easily followed form of each movement. The musical education of his beloved nephew was confined for many years almost exclusively to the playing of Clementi sonatas\". Schindler continues with reference to Beethoven's fondness for Clementi's piano sonatas: \"For these, he had the greatest preference and placed them in the front rank of pieces appropriate to the development of fine piano playing, as much for their lovely, pleasing, fresh melodies as for the well-knit, fluent forms of all the movements.\" Moscheles' edition of Schindler's biography quotes the latter as follows: \"Among all the masters who have written for piano, Beethoven assigned to Clementi the very foremost rank. He considered his works excellent as studies for practice, for the formation of a pure taste, and as truly beautiful subjects for performance. Beethoven used to say: 'They who thoroughly study Clementi, at the same time make themselves acquainted with Mozart and other composers; but the converse is not the fact.'\"\nMozart, who wrote in a letter to his sister Marianne that he would prefer her not to play Clementi's sonatas due to their jumped runs, and wide stretches and chords, which he thought might ruin the natural lightness of her hand.\nErik Satie, a contemporary of Claude Debussy, would later parody these sonatinas (specifically the Sonatina Op. 36, No. 1) in his \"Sonatine bureaucratique\".\nCarl Czerny also had the highest regard for Clementi's piano sonatas and used them successfully in his teaching of Franz Liszt. Czerny referred to Clementi as \"the foremost pianist of his time.\"\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin would often require his pupils to practise Clementi's preludes and exercises because of the exceptional virtues he attributed to them.\nVladimir Horowitz developed a special fondness for Clementi's work after his wife, Wanda Toscanini, bought him Clementi's complete works. He recorded five of Clementi's Sonatas along with shorter pieces.\nBy a ministerial decree dated 20 March 2008, the Opera Omnia of Muzio Clementi was promoted to the status of Italian National Edition. The steering committee of the National Edition consisting of the scholars Andrea Coen (Rome), Roberto De Caro (Bologna, Italy), Roberto Illiano (Lucca \u2014 President), Leon Plantinga (New Haven, Connecticut, US), David Rowland (Milton Keynes, England), Luca L\u00e9vi Sala (Paris/Poitiers, Secretary, and Treasurer), Massimiliano Sala (Pistoia, Vice-President), Rohan H. Stewart-MacDonald (Cambridge, England) and Valeria Tarsetti (Bologna).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2020 census, the population was 65,737. The county seat is Queensbury. The county was established in 1813 and is named in honor of General Joseph Warren, an American Revolutionary War hero of the Battle of Bunker Hill. The county is part of the Capital District region of the state.\nHistory.\nWhen counties were established in the Province of New York in 1683, the present Warren County was part of Albany County. The county was enormous, covering the northern part of New York State, all of the present State of Vermont, and, in theory, extended westward to the Pacific Ocean. It was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont. On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Charlotte County (named for the British queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz), contained the eastern portion.\nIn 1778, the name Charlotte County was changed to Washington County to honor George Washington, the American Revolutionary War general and later President of the United States of America.\nIn 1788, Washington County was reduced in size by the splitting-off of Clinton County. This was a much larger area than the present Clinton County, including several other counties or county parts of the present New York State. Washington County was slightly enlarged by the transfer of the Town of Cambridge from Albany County to Washington County in 1791.\nIn 1813, Warren County was split off from Washington County, receiving its name in honor of General Joseph Warren. County officials first met in the Lake George Coffee House in the hamlet of Caldwell (known today as Lake George Village). James Caldwell, a patenee of the Town of Caldwell, donated land within the hamlet to serve as the county seat beginning in 1819.\nLake George is the site of a YMCA conference center, the Silver Bay YMCA, founded in 1900 and one of only a few of its type in the United States. The Silver Bay Inn was built in 1904 and is on the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn 1963, the courthouse in Lake George village was closed and operations moved several miles south to its present-day location at the Warren County Municipal Center main campus in Queensbury.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (6.9%) is water.\nWarren County is situated in the eastern portion of New York State in the Adirondack Mountains. The eastern border is Washington County. The highest peak in the county is Gore Mountain at an elevation of . It is typically included as the northern part of the Capital District although it is sometimes included as part of the North Country.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Warren County is humid continental, as is most of New York State. In the winter, bouts of cold, dry air arrive from Canada, and interior sections of North America. In the summer, the Gulf Stream can bring days of hot, moist, humid air to the county. Extratropical storms often affect the county; in the winter, Nor'easters bring heavy snow and rain, and sometimes high wind. Fall and spring are generally relatively mild and pleasant, with fall foliage regarded as some of the most stunning in the country. In the summer and fall, back door cold fronts move in from the north and bring thunderstorms, sometimes severe.\nGovernment and politics.\nWarren County historically has been supportive of Republican candidates since the Civil War. Both of Warren County's representatives in the state legislature, Daniel G. Stec in the Senate and Matthew Simpson in the Assembly are Republicans. Currently Republicans constitute 41% of registered voters in Warren County, while Democrats account for 27%. This shift has largely been driven by population growth within the county and reflects the county's shift from a consistently republican county to a lean republican/battleground county in upstate New York.\nDemocrats have been steadily making inroads in recent years; Senator Charles Schumer won the county by 56% in his re-election bid in 2004, and the Democrats recently gained a majority on the Glens Falls City Council. John Hall, a Democrat, picked up the county judgeship position in 2003. In 2006 Republican John E. Sweeney was unseated in the district by Kirsten Gillibrand as Member of Congress. In 2009 Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand was selected by Governor David Paterson to replace Hillary Clinton as New York's junior Senator. Democrat Scott Murphy was elected to replace Gillibrand in a special election for the NY 20th congressional district.\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama narrowly carried Warren County over John McCain, with Obama receiving 16,281 votes countywide to McCain's total of 15,424 votes. This was only the second time since 1964 that Warren County had voted for the Democratic nominee, the other being 1996, when Bill Clinton won with a plurality. In 2012, Obama won again by a similar margin over Republican nominee Mitt Romney. In 2016, Donald Trump flipped the county back to the Republicans, with an 8.5 percent margin of victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In 2020, Warren County voted for Trump again by a very narrow margin of just 57 votes, despite moving 8 points towards the Democratic ticket of former Vice President Joe Biden and junior California senator Kamala Harris. Warren is one of six New York counties that Trump won by less than 500 votes.\nWarren County has 20 county supervisors, which represent 11 of the county's towns and the City of Glens Falls:\nThe board of supervisors control weighted votes for county matters, based on the population of the towns they represent, with the Queensbury Town Supervisor and county supervisors having the largest number of votes on the board.\nThe current Warren County sheriff is James LaFarr. The sheriff's office is structured around three divisions; Administrative Services, Law Enforcement and Correction. The Law Enforcement Division includes both Investigative Services, Patrol Services and the Communications Center. Patrol Services have specialized units that operate under the control of the Division Commander. The sheriff's office provides boat patrols on Lake George and Schroon Lake.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 63,303 people, 25,726 households, and 17,056 families residing in the county.

Health and drug store sales total up to $44,841,000.\nThe county contains the highest concentrated area of medical manufacturers in New York state, with many medical inventions originating in the county. Norman Jekyll and David Sheridan introduced the medical device industry to the Glens Falls area. In the 1940s, they produced products that were from materials supplied by war-torn Europe. One of the primary manufacturers is AngioDynamics Inc., which is located in Queensbury, and is a producer of medical devices used in minimally invasive, image-guided procedures to treat peripheral vascular disease. Another major manufacturer of medical devices is Boston Scientific Corp., which is located in Glens Falls.\nEducation.\nIn Warren County, there are 16 public elementary schools, with the largest being the Queensbury Elementary School, serving 1,150 students and the smallest being the Abraham Wing School, serving 146 students.

SUNY Plattsburgh, based in Clinton County, offers bachelor and master-degree programs at the SUNY Adirondack campus.\nHealthcare.\nThe primary healthcare center in Warren County is the Glens Falls Hospital, which is located in Glens Falls. Providing 410 beds, its most common procedure is miscellaneous diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.\nTransportation.\nBus.\nRegular bus service from Queensbury to Glens Falls is provided by CDTA. These also include trolleys that run on the road. The trolleys go from Bolton Landing (four times a day) and usually turn around just north of Hearthstone Point Campground on Route 9N.\nRoads.\nThere are several state and county maintained roads in Warren County, making up a total of of roadway. The only U.S. Route is U.S. Route 9, which traverses the eastern portion of the county. The only interstate is Interstate 87, also known as the Adirondack Northway.\nSouth of Lake George Village.\nOnly New York State Route 9N traverses the Lake Luzerne region of Warren County. There are two state-maintained routes in Glens Falls: Route 9L, which terminates in the city, while the second is New York State Route 32, which leaves Warren for Washington County, where it terminates at New York State Route 196. Also, on the eastern side of the city, there is County Route 79 (Boulevard), a former alignment of NY 32. There is New York State Route 149, a long road that traverses Warren and nearby Washington counties. There is also New York State Route 254, a road in southern part of the town and enters Washington County as well. The third and final state maintained route is New York State Route 9L, which traverses down the central portion of the town. Several county routes traverse through Stony Creek. These include County Route 3, County Route 12, County Route 22, and County Route 76.\nLake George Village.\nThere are several major routes in the town and village of Lake George. There is New York State Route 9N, which traverses north to south through the county. There is also County Routes 6 (Fort George Boulevard) and 59 (Bloody Pond Road). The latter is a continuation of New York State Route 9L and heads to terminate in Queensbury. In this town includes New York State Route 912Q, which is the Exit 22 connector/park &amp; ride on the Northway.\nNorth of Lake George Village.\nAlthough the region for Bolton and Bolton Landing is large, there is only one state-maintained route, Route 9N, and there is County Route 11 (Bolton-Riverbank Road), which is a connector to Exit 24 on the Northway. Only two county or higher-level maintained roads traverse the hamlet of Diamond Point, Route 9N and County Route 35 (Diamond Point Road), which connects 9N to the Northway (Exit 23) and U.S. Route 9 in Warrensburg. New York State Route 8 enters the county at Johnsburg, entering into the Town of Chester, where it merges with U.S. Route 9 for almost four miles, splitting off at the Landon Hill/Route 8/Route 9 intersection. New York State Route 8 terminates at an intersection with New York State Route 9N in the center of Hague. There are several state-maintained and county-maintained roads in the Warrensburg area. These include the termini of both New York State Route 28 and New York State Route 418 at US 9.

A New York State historic marker was placed for the Warren County Bicentennial honoring Weber Furlong On July 23, 2013, at City Hall in Glens Falls.\nPoints of interest.\nLake George.\nWarren County is the primary area of tourism related to Lake George. Lake George is a lake located in the Adirondack Mountains. Popular activities on the lake include river tubing, swimming, kayaking and boating. There are several large points of interest in the Lake George region. These include Prospect Mountain just outside town, Steel Pier along Beach Road which serves several tour boats. The village is a popular tourist spot and is home to many stores and novelty shops. There is the Lake George Battleground on the edge of the village along County Route 6.\nTo the north, there are several hotels and motels to serve tourists visiting the lake. There are several campgrounds around the region including Hearthstone Point on Route 9N and Lake George Battleground south of the village. There are also several campgrounds on islands on the lake. These include Long Island, which serves 88 campsites. All island campgrounds and land-locked grounds are maintained by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.\nHistoric sites.\nOne of the premiere historic sites in Warren County is the Fredella, Joseph J., House and Garage, which was constructed in 1900, and is significant for its architectural detail.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 161,130. Its county seat is Troy. The county is named in honor of the family of Kiliaen van Rensselaer, the original Dutch owner of the land in the area. The county is part of the Capital District region of the state.\nRensselaer County is part of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nThe area that is now Rensselaer County was inhabited by the Algonquian-speaking Mohican Indian tribe at the time of European encounter. Kiliaen van Rensselaer, a Dutch jeweler and merchant, purchased the area in 1630 and incorporated it in his patroonship Rensselaerswyck. (It was part of the Dutch colony New Netherland).\nThe land passed into English rule in 1664; the Dutch regained control in 1673, but the English took it back in 1674. Until 1776, the year of American independence, the county was under English or British control. The county was not organized as a legal entity until after the Revolution, in 1791, when it was created from an area that was originally part of the very large Albany County.\nIn 1807, in a county re-organization, the rural sections of Troy were set off as Towns, and the city was incorporated. The two towns created were Brunswick (named for Duke Friedrich Wilhelm of Braunschweig-L\u00fcneburg) and Grafton (named for Henry FitzRoy, 5th Duke of Grafton). A third town, Philipstown, was set off in 1806. In 1808, it was renamed Nassau after the duke of that area.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.9%) is water.\nRensselaer County is located in the far eastern part of New York State. The eastern boundary of the county runs along the New York\u2013Vermont and New York\u2013Massachusetts borders.\nThe terrain runs from level and flat near the Hudson and then rises into the Rensselaer Plateau around Poestenkill and Sand Lake, then to the Taconic Mountains along the Massachusetts state line.\nThe highest point is Berlin Mountain, above sea level, in the town of Berlin. The lowest point is above sea level at the Hudson River's southernmost extent in the county.\nThe Hoosic River, a tributary of the Hudson River, is in the northern part of the county.\nDepending on precise location within the county, road travel distance to New York City ranges between .\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 159,429 people, 62,694 households, and 39,989 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 69,120 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 88.73% White, 7.14% Black or African American, 0.23% Native American, 1.71% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.89% from other races, and 1.34% from two or more races. 5.01% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 22.3% were of Irish, 14.7% Italian, 12.8% German, 7.5% English, 6.2% French, 5.3% American and 2.3% Puerto Rican ancestry according to Census 2010. 95.4% spoke English and 2.7% Spanish as their first language.\nThere were 61,094 households, out of which 33.30% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.80% were married couples living together, 12.00% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.80% were non-families. 27.90% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.30% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.02.\nIn the county, the population was spread out, with 24.20% under the age of 18, 10.10% from 18 to 24, 29.10% from 25 to 44, 23.00% from 45 to 64, and 13.60% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 95.90 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.70 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $42,905, and the median income for a family was $52,864. Males had a median income of $36,666 versus $28,153 for females. The per capita income for the county was $21,095. About 6.70% of families and 9.50% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.90% of those under age 18 and 6.60% of those age 65 or over.\nGovernment and politics.\nFrom 1884 through the 1988 campaign, voters in \nRensselaer County chiefly supported the Republican candidate. Donald Trump carried the county in 2016.\nBeginning in 1791, Rensselaer County was governed by a Board of Supervisors, which acted as the Legislature, with the chairman of the board serving as a \"de facto\" Executive. The Board of Supervisors form of government was terminated as a result of a class action lawsuit brought by Troy attorney Marvin I. Honig on behalf of his wife, Nedda, during March 1968. Mr. Honig brought this lawsuit to declare that the Board of Supervisors, as constituted, violated the \"one man, one vote\" principal declared by the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Honig's motive in bringing the lawsuit was to punish the Rensselaer County Republican Party chairman and certain members of the Board of Supervisors for defaulting on an agreement with him. The NY Supreme Court ruled in Honig's favor, and ordered the creation of a legislative body. Several plans were offered, but a plan proposed by Honig was adopted by the Court, and its decision was affirmed by the Appellate Division and Court of Appeals. The first \"Honig Plan\" was drawn to favor the Democratic party, which had not had control of the county government in decades. That plan, which controlled the 1969 election, resulted in the Democrats winning control of the new Rensselaer County Legislature. Thereafter, following a change of leadership in the Republican party, Honig brought a new plan, drawn to favor Republican candidates, to the court, which adopted his revised plan. The second \"Honig Plan\" was affirmed by the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals. The Republican candidates won back the County Legislature in the 1971 election, and Honig became the Renssselaer County Attorney, a position he held for well over a decade. A full explanation of the creation of the Rensselaer County Legislature can be found at http://nassau-stories.blogspot.com/2006/04/reapportionment.html. See also: The Troy Record, July 8, 1971, page 1.\nIn 1970, the Rensselaer County Legislature was created, which elected Edward J. \"Ned\" Quinn as chairman. The chairman served as the equivalent to an executive until the office of County Executive was created in 1972. Since its creation, Democrats have never won the office, although they controlled the Legislature until 1994. One notable candidate for Executive was Edward Pattison who was later elected to Congress, and whose son Mark served two terms as Mayor of Troy. The current county executive is Steve McLaughlin (R).\nLegislative authority is vested in the County Legislature, which consists of 19 members representing 17 different communities, separated into six districts. The current composition of the Legislature is as follows (ten Republicans, six Democrats, two Conservatives who caucus with the Republicans, and one Independent who caucuses with the Republicans):\nDistrict 1 \u2013 City of Troy:\nDistrict 2 \u2013 East Greenbush, North Greenbush, and Poestenkill:\nDistrict 3 \u2013 Brunswick, Pittstown, and Schaghticoke:\nDistrict 4 \u2013 Nassau, Sand Lake, and Schodack:\nDistrict 5 \u2013 Berlin, Grafton, Hoosick, Hoosick Falls, Petersburgh, and Stephentown:\nDistrict 6 \u2013 City of Rensselaer:\nAs of 2021[ [update]] the current sheriff is Patrick A. Russo. Notably, Russo was the only sheriff in the state to embrace Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g), which authorizes local and county law enforcement to detain undocumented immigrants.\nEducation.\nThe county is serviced by 16 school districts. Some are completely contained in the county while some cross county lines into other counties. No school districts cross either the Vermont or Massachusetts state borders. Below is a table that shows the districts within the county, which BOCES they belong to, and which other counties they may serve.\nThe private, coeducational Doane Stuart School is also located in Rensselaer County.\nThe county is also home to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the oldest operating technological college in America.\nCommunities.\nLarger Settlements.\n\u2020 - County seat\nTowns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHamlets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54454", "revid": "13892963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54454", "title": "Putnam County, New York", "text": "County in New York, United States\nPutnam County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 97,668. The county seat is Carmel, within one of the county's six towns. The county is part of the Hudson Valley region of the state.\nPutnam County is bordered by Dutchess County to the north, Connecticut and its county of Fairfield to the east, Westchester County to the south, and the Hudson River and Orange County to the west. Midtown Manhattan is around a one-hour drive, and the county is included in the New York metropolitan area.\nPutnam County was formed in 1812 from Dutchess County and is named for Israel Putnam, a hero in the French and Indian War and a general in the American Revolutionary War.\nIt is one of the most affluent counties in America, ranked 21st by median household income, and 43rd by per-capita income, according to the 2012 American Community Survey and 2009\u20132013 American Community Survey, respectively.\nHistory.\nIn 1609, the Wappinger Native American people inhabited the east bank of the Hudson River. They farmed, hunted, and fished throughout their range, often encountering Dutch fur traders. They obtained metal tools and goods such as alcohol and firearms in exchange for furs.\nThe colonial Province of New York and the Connecticut Colony negotiated an agreement on November 28, 1683, establishing their border as east of the Hudson River, and north to Massachusetts. Dutchess county was organized as one of New York's twelve counties. It included all of today's Putnam County and two towns in the present Columbia county. Until 1713, Dutchess was administered by Ulster county.\nIn 1691, a group of Dutch traders purchased a tract of land from the Wappingers that spanned from the Hudson River to the Connecticut border. Six years later they sold it to wealthy Dutch-American merchant Adolphus Philipse, who obtained a Royal sanction for a \"Highland Patent\" (later to be known as the Philipse Patent) that encompassed most of today's Putnam County. Unknown at that time was a northwest veer in the river's path at the Hudson Highlands. This generated a dispute over a roughly 2-mile-wide section of border between northern Westchester County, then-Dutchess County, and the Connecticut Colony, which came to be known as \"The Oblong\".\nIn 1737, the New York Colonial Assembly designated the Philipse Patent as the South Precinct of Dutchess County. The Philipses began leasing farms to migrants from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Long Island, and lower Westchester. After Adolph Philipse's death, the Patent was divided in 1754 into nine lots granted to three heirs: Mary Philipse, Philip Philipse, and Susannah Philipse Robinson. During the French and Indian War, many of the Wappinger went to Stockbridge, Massachusetts.\nCompared to other parts of the Hudson Valley, Putnam County had slow settlement. It was privately owned and settlement was limited to tenant farmers willing to pay the Philipse family for leases. Secondly, it was mostly hilly and rocky, making it unappealing to men looking for tillable cropland. Its use was generally limited to dairy farming and wood cutting. The first non-tenant settlers in the county were along its eastern edge. The ambiguous border with Connecticut attracted farmers from New England. They assumed that Philipse did not own the disputed area.\nAmong early settlers were the Hayt family, which built a farm called The Elm in 1720. Jacob Haviland settled in the Oblong in 1731 in what became known as Haviland Hollow. The first village in the county was Fredericksburg, now the hamlet of Patterson.\nDuring the American Revolution, the Philipses stayed loyal to the Crown. As a consequence, their lands were confiscated by the New York government. It sold the Philipse Patent along with the rest of their holdings. The dispute over The Oblong was resolved in the aftermath of the war, with the heavily settled tract being incorporated as the first of two versions of the Town of Southeast. Also resolved were two \"Gores\", the Beekman Gore and the Rombout Gore, which being geographically similar to the Livingston and Beekman patents they abutted, were ceded by the Philipses to Dutchess County in 1758 and 1771 respectively.\nDue to the increasing population of the Southern Precinct of Dutchess County and the great distance of these communities from the county seat in Poughkeepsie, Putnam was split from Dutchess in 1812 and organized as an independent county. It encompassed all of the Philipse Patent and the Oblong abutting it, less a triangular area in the farthest northwest reach of the Patent. There, a lowland near Fishkill Creek isolated from the rest of Putnam County and its adjacent upland drainage leading into the Hudson Highlands to the south, were ceded to Dutchess.\nPutnam travelers mostly used boats and ships along the Hudson River. Boats transporting goods traveled up the Hudson to ports, mainly at Peekskill, New York. They were transported by road into Putnam County, or goods were unloaded in Putnam County at Cold Spring, New York. Such transport suffered in winter, when the river froze. At that time, little food or goods could be shipped to the county.\nThe Philipstown Turnpike was created in 1815 as a toll road from Cold Spring to Connecticut. The wagons that traveled the road would transport produce from eastern Putnam County and iron ore from the mines. The route of the turnpike can roughly be traced today: Rt 301 from Cold Spring to Farmers Mills Road, to White Pond Road to Pecksville, then Holmes Rd to Patterson, then Quaker Hill Rd to Connecticut. Transportation improved with the advent of the railroad, namely the Harlem Line, which was built in the 1840s, connecting Putnam by rail to New York City. Originally there were four stations on the Harlem line in Putnam County: Brewster, Dykeman's, Towner's, and Patterson. Today only the Brewster and Patterson stops remain; a new one called Southeast was added in modern times.\nPutnam County played an important role in the Civil War. One third of the county's men between the ages of 15 and 55 served in the military during the war years. During the post-Civil War years, industry and agriculture suffered losses as the economy contracted. Iron, which was produced in the Highland Mountains, could be found elsewhere. Agriculture was also affected greatly. The increasing need for drinking water in New York City led the city to search for sources in the Hudson Valley. In Putnam County, much of the farmland was flooded to create reservoirs as part of New York City's Croton Watershed. The abandoning of farms, the creation of reservoirs, and the preservation of the remaining open land resulted in scenic lands that drew large amounts of tourism from New York City.\nBy the 20th century, improved roads brought vacationers from New York City. The Taconic State Parkway was constructed during the Great Depression as one of numerous infrastructure projects in the state and country. This brought more vacationers from the city, who were attracted to the scenic lands and the inexpensive hotels, inns, and summer houses. Putnam County's population doubled during the summer months.\nAfter World War II, Putnam County became an exurb of New York City. Rapid residential development occurred and the county became a bedroom community. However, the prevalent rocky uplands and protection of Putnam county's reservoirs inherently limited development, as much of the land in the county is close to wetlands or reservoirs.\nGovernment and politics.\nGovernmental operations in Putnam County are set forth in the County Charter, which was approved by the voters of the County in November 1977.\nThe law-making and policy-making body of the county is an elected nine-member County Legislature. County laws, policies and regulations are administered on behalf of the County Legislature by an elected County Executive.\nThe current County Executive is Republican Kevin M. Byrne (R) After serving the state of New York for 6 years as the Assemblyman of the 94th district, he won the Republican nomination for Putnam County Executive and then went unopposed in the general election.\nPrior to the Charter form of government, the county's affairs were governed by a Board of Supervisors, with one Supervisor from each of the county's six towns having an equal vote. Since the towns had varying populations and such variance violated the principle of \"one man, one vote\", a system of weighted voting among the Board of Supervisors was implemented, but proved to be unwieldy. It was this imbalance which, among others factors, inspired the reorganization of County government under a charter form.\nCounty legislature.\nThe members of the county legislature for the 2025 session include 8 Republicans and 1 Democrat:\nCounty Legislators are elected to three-year terms. Each single-member district contains approximately 10,500 people. Any person elected to the County Legislature on or after February 1, 2014, is limited to four three-year terms in office (without taking into account any previous terms held by such person prior to February 1, 2014). Legislative terms are staggered so that one-third of the members of the County Legislature is elected each year.\nCounty Executives.\nThe county has had six County Executives:\nCounty courts.\nThere are three types of general trial courts in Putnam County: the New York Supreme Court, the County Court and the Justice Courts. The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the New York State Unified Court System, which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest court of appeals in the federal system as well as in most states, whereas the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Putnam hears civil cases involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over criminal cases in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Putnam, however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.\nThe County Court is authorized to hear all criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles felony cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on misdemeanor cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.\nThe Historic Putnam County Courthouse is located in the town of Carmel. Built in 1814 in Greek Revival style, it is the second oldest working courthouse in New York, second to the one in Johnstown. Portico and pillars were added to the structure in the 1840s. It was recently extensively remodeled to preserve the structure and adapt it for use as the Surrogate's Court.\nThe new Putnam County Courthouse opened on January 2, 2008. It was constructed at a cost of $22.8 million. Jury assembly, court clerks and a public law library are located on the first floor. The second floor includes a Family Court and hearing room. On all floors are judges' chambers, jury deliberation rooms, prisoner cells and conference rooms. The third floor has two courtrooms for the County Court. The Supreme Court and a law library occupy the fourth floor.\nLaw enforcement.\nLaw enforcement is providing by the following departments:\nThe Putnam County Sheriff's Office includes a Civil Bureau, patrol division, a marine unit, a motorcycle unit, a school resource unit, and a narcotics enforcement unit.\nCounty Sheriff.\nBrian Hess is the acting sheriff of the county. He replaced Kevin McConville (Republican Party) who died on August 22, 2025. The Sheriff's Department includes a Civil Bureau, patrol division, a marine unit, a motorcycle unit, a school resource unit, and a narcotics enforcement unit.\nState and national government.\nPutnam County is part of the 94th State Assembly District (Towns of Carmel, Patterson, Putnam Valley and Southeast), represented by Matt Slater (R), and the 95th State Assembly District (Towns of Kent and Phillipstown), represented by Dana Levenberg (D).\nPutnam County is part of the 40th State Senate District (Towns of Carmel, Patterson, and Southeast), represented by Peter Harckham (D), and the 41st State Senate District (Towns of Kent, Phillipstown and Putnam Valley), represented by Democrat Michelle Hinchey.\nPutnam County is located in the 17th congressional district and has been represented by Republican Mike Lawler since 2023.\nPutnam County has voted consistently for Republican presidential candidates, largely bucking the Democratic trend in the New York City suburbs. From 1828 to 1868, Putnam was a Democratic stronghold, but since 1872, the only Democratic presidential nominees to carry Putnam County have been Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (6.5%) is water.\nPutnam County is situated in the lower Hudson Valley in the southeastern part of New York, between the Hudson River on its west and the New York-Connecticut border on its east.\nPutnam is southeast of Newburgh, and it is north of White Plains. Depending on precise location within the county, road travel distance to New York City ranges between .\nThe terrain of the county is generally hilly. The region of the county nearest the Hudson River is especially so, and is part of the Hudson Highlands. The highest point in Putnam County is Scofield Ridge, with four summits at approximately above sea level. The lowest point is sea level along the Hudson.\nThe Hudson River, named for Henry Hudson, has provided transportation of goods from New York City, north to the Hudson Valley, throughout history. Between the hills and glacial moraine, Putnam County's valleys contain numerous wetlands (including part of the Great Swamp), creeks, ponds, lakes (including the 583 acre Lake Mahopac, and reservoirs.\nReservoirs.\nPutnam County is known for its many pristine reservoirs, part of the New York City water supply system's Croton Watershed. These include Bog Brook in Southeast; Croton Falls Reservoir in Carmel and Southeast; Diverting Reservoir in Southeast; East Branch in Brewster; Middle Branch Reservoir in Southeast; West Branch in Kent and Carmel, and Boyds Corner Reservoir in Kent. There are also three controlled lakes in the system in the town of Carmel, Kirk, Gilead, and Gleneida.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Putnam County is humid continental, as is most of New York. In the winter, bouts of cold, dry air arrive from Canada, and interior sections of North America. In the summer, the Gulf Stream brings hot, moist, humid air to the county. Extratropical storms often affect the county; in the winter, Nor'easters bring heavy snow and rain, and sometimes high wind. In the summer and fall, back door cold fronts move in from the north and bring thunderstorms, sometimes severe. Putnam County receives on average 36 inches of snowfall a year.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the 2020 Census, there were 97,668 people and 38,713 households in the county, with 2.76 persons per household. The population density was . 50.1% of the population was female. The racial makeup of the county was 77.1% White alone, not Hispanic or Latino, 3.9% Black or African American, 0.5% Native American, 2.3% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.0% from other races, 1.8% from two or more races and 16.4% Hispanic or Latino of any race. 12.9% of the population was foreign born.\n4.5% of the population was under the age of 5, 19.4% under the age of 18, and 18.0% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43.4 years.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $104,486, and the per capita income was $47,448. 5.2% of the population was in poverty.\n93% of the population at least 25 years old had a high school degree or higher, and 39.6% had a bachelor's degree or higher.\nThere were 38,713 housing units, 81.8% of which were owner occupied. As of Q4 2021, the median value of all homes in Putnam County was $419,890, an increase of 12.1% from the prior year.\nEducation.\nThe county has the following public school districts:\nMahopac is the largest school district in Putnam County, educating more than 5,000 students in four elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school (1600 students).\nSaint Basil Academy, a private boarding facility, functioned as a private school with in-house instruction until 1997.\nThe library system consists of eight libraries; the Brewster Public Library in Brewster; the Kent Public Library in Kent; the Reed Memorial Library in Carmel; the Julia L. Butterfield Memorial Library in Cold Spring; the Alice Curtis Desmond and Hamilton Fish Library in Garrison; the Mahopac Public Library in Mahopac; the Patterson Library in Patterson, and the Putnam Valley Free Library in Putnam Valley.\nAs of 2022[ [update]] SUNY Westchester Community College holds some general education classes at Mahopac High School.\nInfrastructure.\nPutnam County was provided with the majority of its electricity by the nuclear Indian Point Energy Center in Westchester County until April 30, 2021.\nWater is supplied from wells, lakes, or the Hudson River.\nThe Putnam Hospital Center, located in Carmel, serves the eastern county. Western Putnam County is mainly served by hospitals in Dutchess or Westchester counties.\nTransportation.\nThe county has several passenger trains that serve the county. The Harlem Line and the Hudson Line of the Metro-North Railroad run north\u2013south in Putnam. The Harlem Line makes stops at Brewster, Southeast, and Patterson. The Hudson Line makes stops at Manitou, Garrison, Cold Spring, and Breakneck Ridge. A connection to Amtrak can be made to the south at Croton-Harmon in upper Westchester County or to the north at Poughkeepsie in Dutchess County, both on the Hudson Line. Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan is roughly a one-hour train ride.\nUntil May 1958, a third commuter line, the New York Central's Putnam Division, operating between the Bronx and points in the county, served the region. With no direct connection to Grand Central Terminal (a transfer was required in the Bronx), ridership on the line was weak compared to its counterparts. Freight service was also scant. The line was eventually abandoned in waves between 1962 and 1980. The former railbed has been converted to trails, and now serves as the South County Trailway, North County Trailway, and Putnam County Trailway rail trails.\nPutnam Transit, operated by the county, provides local public transportation.\nIn contrast to the surrounding counties, Putnam has no airport.\nMajor roadways.\nPutnam has two interstate highways. The east\u2013west Interstate 84 comes in from the north near Ludingtonville, and connects to the southbound Interstate 684 in Southeast toward the Connecticut border. The Taconic State Parkway runs north\u2013south through central Putnam. Three of the region's major east\u2013west routes traverse the eastern half of the county. NY 52 enters alongside I-84 from Dutchess County, to end at US 6 south of Carmel. East of Brewster, US 6 joins US 202 and the routes leave the county and state concurrently aside the interstate.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPoints of interest.\nChuang Yen Monastery, located in Kent, is home to the largest indoor Buddha statue in the Western Hemisphere.

Before Gannett merged its local dailies into the \"Journal News\", Putnam County was served by an edition of the \"Reporter Dispatch\".\nPutnam County newsreaders were served for generations by the \"Putnam County News and Recorder\", formerly an independently owned newspaper devoted to local affairs. The oversized broadsheet \u2013 measuring seventeen by twenty inches \u2013 was first published in Cold Spring as \"The Recorder\" in 1866. In July 2008, the local ownership sold the paper to Roger Ailes, chairman of Fox News, who named his wife Elizabeth as the new publisher. The paper altered its editorial content substantially, generating local controversy. In 2009 the Ailes family also purchased the \"Putnam County Courier\", when it was shut down by Journal Register Co. (The first issue after publication resumed listed Roger Ailes as owner and chairman, but Elizabeth Ailes has since been identified as the owner). \"The Courier\" was first established as the \"Putnam County Democrat\" in 1841. Under Ailes ownership, the \"Courier\" closed its Carmel office. The \"News and Recorder\" remained a full broadsheet, with a 17-inch-wide front page, until 2017. Both newspapers are now standard-sized broadsheets. The two newspapers share an editor and many of the same stories appear in both. Douglas Cunningham, editor-in-chief of the \"Courier\" and \"News and Recorder\" since 2011, purchased the two papers from the Ailes in December 2016 and became publisher.\nTwo other weeklies are the \"Putnam County Times\" (historically \"Times &amp; Republican\") and \"Putnam County Press\", virtually identical except that the former is distributed free. Both have been owned since 1958 by Don Hall. Hall and Roger Ailes, though both Republicans, are bitter rivals. Hall had long derided Ailes as a part-time resident. When Ailes faced harassment allegations, leading to his ouster from \"Fox News\", his Putnam County connection contributed to his being featured on the front pages of the \"Times\" and \"Press\".\nIn 2010, Gordon Stewart, a businessman living in Garrison, launched a news website to compete with the Ailes-owned \"PCNR\" called Philipstown.info. In 2012 a print version was launched called \"The Paper\". Shortly Stewart's death in 2014, the publication became a nonprofit led by a board of directors. It changed its name in 2016 to \"The Highlands Current\" to reflect its coverage of neighboring Beacon.\nCommunities.\nThere are six towns and three incorporated villages in Putnam County. There are no cities:\nTowns.\nCarmel.\nCarmel is the largest town of Putnam County, with a population of 33,576. The Town of Carmel includes the hamlets of the county seat Carmel, Carmel Hills, Field Corners, Hopkins Corners, Mahopac, Mahopac Falls, Secor Corners, Tilly Foster, and West Mahopac. Carmel is along the southern border of Putnam County.\nCarmel is known for its historic courthouse and high school, which serves grades 9\u201312. Carmel was taken in 1795 from Frederickstown, a town which encompassed the present towns of Kent, Patterson, and Carmel.\nKent.\nKent is a town located along the northern border of Putnam with a population of 12,900. Coles Mills was settled in 1747 at the outlet of Barrett Pond into the West Branch of the Croton River. Kent contains the hamlets of Lake Carmel, Kent Corners, Kent Hills, and Ludingtonville. Kent was the last remaining section of Frederickstown, after the towns of Carmel and Patterson were divided from it in 1795. Frederickstown was founded in 1788.\nPatterson.\nThe Town of Patterson is located in the northeast area of Putnam County and has a population of 11,541. Patterson, originally named Franklin, was divided from the former town of Frederickstown, in 1795. Patterson contains the hamlets of Patterson, Barnum Corners, Camp Brady, Fields Corners, Haines Corners, Haviland Hollow, Putnam Lake, Steinbeck Corners, Towners, and West Patterson.\nPhilipstown.\nPhilipstown is a town located along the western end of Putnam County and it has a population of 9,831. Philipstown contains the villages and hamlets of Cold Spring, Forsonville, Garrison, Garrison Four Corners, Glenclyffe, Manitou, McKeel Corners, Nelsonville, North Highlands, Storm King, and the north side of Continental Village. It was founded in 1788. West Point (in Orange County) is located across the Hudson River from the village of Cold Spring.\nIt has three stations on the Metro North Railroad Hudson line: in Garrison, Cold Spring and Manitou, which has limited train service.\nTwo public libraries are located in Philipstown: the Desmond-Fish Library in Garrison and the Julia L. Butterfield Library in Cold Spring.\nPutnam Valley.\nPutnam Valley is a town located on the southern border of Putnam County with a population of 11,762. It is the third largest town in the county. Putnam Valley contains the hamlets of Adams Corners, Christian Corners, Gilbert Corners, Lake Peekskill, Oscawana Corners, Putnam Valley, Tompkins Corners, Sunnybrook.\nPutnam Valley was created in 1835 as the Town Of Quincy, taking its current name the following year. The town was created by splitting off from Philipstown. Putnam Valley is home to the Clarence Fahnestock State Park, which covers much of Putnam County and some of Dutchess County.\nSoutheast.\nThe Town of Southeast is located in the southeastern corner of Putnam County, with a population of 18,058. It was founded in 1788 as one of the three original towns in what would later become Putnam County. Its shape changed greatly in 1795, when it lost its northern half to Patterson and gained a great amount on its western side.\nIt is the second-largest town in Putnam County, second only to Carmel. The crossroads of Interstate highways 684 and 84; State Routes 22 and 312; and US Highways 6 and 202 are located here. Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line has two stops that service the area, at Brewster Village and Southeast Station (formerly Brewster North) off Route 312. Southeast contains the village of Brewster, and the hamlets of Brewster Hill, Brewster Heights, Deans Corners, DeForest Corners, Drewville Heights, Dykemans, Milltown, Peach Lake, Sears Corners, and Sodom.\nVillages.\nBrewster.\nBrewster is an incorporated village within the Town of Southeast.\nCold Spring.\nCold Spring is an incorporated village within the Town of Philipstown, bordering the village of Nelsonville.\nNelsonville.\nNelsonville is an incorporated village within the Town of Philipstown, bordering the village of Cold Spring.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

S-expressions were invented for, and popularized by, the programming language Lisp, which uses them for source code as well as data.\nCharacteristics.\nIn the usual parenthesized syntax of Lisp, an S-expression is classically defined as\nThis definition reflects LISP's representation of a list as a series of \"cells\", each one an ordered pair. In plain lists, \"y\" points to the next cell (if any), thus forming a list. The recursive clause of the definition means that both this representation and the S-expression notation can represent any binary tree. However, the representation can in principle allow circular references, in which case the structure is not a tree at all, but a cyclic graph, and cannot be represented in classical S-expression notation\nunless a convention for cross-reference is provided (analogous to SQL foreign keys, SGML/XML IDREFs, etc.). Modern Lisp dialects such as Common Lisp and Scheme provide such syntax via \"datum labels\", with which objects can be marked, which can then recur elsewhere, indicating shared rather than duplicated structure, enabling the reader or printer to detect and thus trigger evaluation or display of cycles without infinitely recursing\n codice_3\nThe definition of an atom varies per context; in the original definition by John McCarthy, it was assumed that there existed \"an infinite set of distinguishable atomic symbols\" represented as \"strings of capital Latin letters and digits with single embedded blanks\" (a subset of character string and numeric literals).\nMost modern sexpr notations allow more general quoted strings (for example including punctuation or full Unicode), and use an abbreviated notation to represent lists with more than 2 members, so that\n codice_4\nstands for\n codice_5\ncodice_6 is the special end-of-list object (alternatively written codice_7, which is the only representation in Scheme).\nIn the Lisp family of programming languages, S-expressions are used to represent both source code and data. Other uses of S-expressions are in Lisp-derived languages such as DSSSL, and as mark-up in communication protocols like IMAP and John McCarthy's CBCL. It is also used as text representation of WebAssembly. The details of the syntax and supported data types vary in the different languages, but the most common feature among these languages is the use of S-expressions and prefix notation.\nDatatypes and syntax.\nThere are many variants of the S-expression format, supporting a variety of different syntaxes for different datatypes. The most widely supported are:\nThe character codice_17 is often used to prefix extensions to the syntax, e.g. codice_18 for hexadecimal integers, or codice_19 for characters.\nUse in Lisp.\nWhen representing source code in Lisp, the first element of an S-expression is commonly an operator or function name and any remaining elements are treated as arguments. This is called \"prefix notation\" or \"Polish notation\". As an example, the Boolean expression written codice_20 in C, is represented as codice_21 in Lisp's s-expr-based prefix notation.\nAs noted above, the precise definition of \"atom\" varies across LISP-like languages. A quoted string can typically contain anything but a quote, while\nan unquoted identifier atom can typically contain anything but quotes, whitespace characters, parentheses, brackets, braces, backslashes, and semicolons. In either case, a prohibited character can typically be included by escaping it with a preceding backslash. Unicode support varies.\nThe recursive case of the s-expr definition is traditionally implemented using cons cells.\nS-expressions were originally intended only for data to be manipulated by M-expressions, but the first implementation of Lisp was an interpreter of S-expression encodings of M-expressions, and Lisp programmers soon became accustomed to using S-expressions for both code and data.\nThis means that Lisp is homoiconic; that is, the primary representation of programs is also a data structure in a primitive type of the language itself.\nNested lists can be written as S-expressions: codice_22 is a two-element S-expression whose elements are also two-element S-expressions. The whitespace-separated notation used in Lisp (and this article) is typical. Line breaks (newline characters) usually qualify as separators. This is a simple context-free grammar for a tiny subset of English written as an S-expression (Gazdar/Melish, Natural Language Processing in Lisp), where S=sentence, NP=Noun Phrase, VP=Verb Phrase, V=Verb:\n ((VP) (V))\n ((VP) (V NP))\n ((V) died)\n ((V) employed)\n ((NP) nurses)\n ((NP) patients)\n ((NP) Medicenter)\n ((NP) \"Dr Chan\"))\nProgram code can be written in S-expressions, usually using prefix notation. Example in Common Lisp:\n (if (zerop x)\n 1\n (* x (factorial (- x 1)))))\nS-expressions can be read in Lisp using the function READ. READ reads the textual representation of an S-expression and returns Lisp data. The function PRINT can be used to output an S-expression. The output then can be read with the function READ, when all printed data objects have a readable representation. Lisp has readable representations for numbers, strings, symbols, lists and many other data types. Program code can be formatted as pretty printed S-expressions using the function PPRINT (note: with two Ps, short for \"pretty\"-print).\nLisp programs are valid S-expressions, but not all S-expressions are valid Lisp programs. codice_23 is a valid S-expression, but not a valid Lisp program, since Lisp uses prefix notation and a floating point number (here 1.0) is not valid as an operation (the first element of the expression).\nAn S-expression preceded by a single quotation mark, as in codice_24, is syntactic sugar for a quoted S-expression, in this case codice_25.\nRelation to XML.\nS-expressions are often compared to XML: one key difference is that S-expressions have just one form of containment, the dotted pair, while XML tags can contain simple attributes, other tags, or CDATA, each using different syntax. Another is that S-expressions do not define a reference mechanism, whereas XML provides a notion of unique identifiers and references to them. For simple use cases, S-expressions are simpler than XML, but for more advanced use cases, XML has a query language called XPath which many tools and third party libraries use to simplify the handling of XML data.\nStandardization.\nStandards for some Lisp-derived programming languages include a specification for their S-expression syntax. These include Common Lisp (ANSI standard document ANSI INCITS 226-1994 (R2004)), Scheme (R5RS and R6RS), and ISLISP.\nIn May 1997, Ron Rivest submitted an Internet Draft to be considered for publication as an RFC. The draft defined a syntax based on Lisp S-expressions but intended for general-purpose data storage and exchange (similar to XML) rather than specifically for programming. It was never approved as an RFC, but it has since been cited and used by other RFCs (e.g. RFC 2693) and several other publications. It was originally intended for use in SPKI.\nRivest's format defines an S-expression as being either an octet-string (a series of bytes) or a finite list of other S-expressions. It describes three interchange formats for expressing this structure. One is the \"advanced transport\", which is very flexible in terms of formatting, and is syntactically similar to Lisp-style expressions, but they are not identical. The advanced transport, for example, allows octet-strings to be represented verbatim (the string's length followed by a colon and the entire raw string), a quoted form allowing escape characters, hexadecimal, Base64, or placed directly as a \"token\" if it meets certain conditions. (Rivest's tokens differ from Lisp tokens in that the former are just for convenience and aesthetics, and treated exactly like other strings, while the latter have specific syntactical meaning.)\nRivest's draft defines a canonical representation \"for digital signature purposes\". It is intended to be compact, easier to parse, and unique for any abstract S-expression. It only allows verbatim strings, and prohibits whitespace as formatting outside strings. Finally there is the \"basic transport representation\", which is either the canonical form or the same encoded as Base64 and surrounded by braces, the latter intended to safely transport a canonically encoded S-expression in a system which might change spacing (e.g. an email system which has 80-character-wide lines and wraps anything longer than that).\nThis format has not been widely adapted for use outside of SPKI (some of the users being GnuPG, libgcrypt, Nettle, and GNU lsh). Rivest's S-expressions web page provides C source code for a parser and generator (available under the MIT license), which could be adapted and embedded into other programs. In addition, there are no restrictions on independently implementing the format.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In software, an audio codec is a computer program implementing an algorithm that compresses and decompresses digital audio data according to a given audio file or streaming media audio coding format. The objective of the algorithm is to represent the high-fidelity audio signal with a minimum number of bits while retaining quality. This can effectively reduce the storage space and the bandwidth required for transmission of the stored audio file. Most software codecs are implemented as libraries which interface to one or more multimedia players. Most modern audio compression algorithms are based on modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) coding and linear predictive coding (LPC).\nIn hardware, audio codec refers to a single device that encodes analog audio as digital signals and decodes digital back into analog. In other words, it contains both an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) running off the same clock signal. This is used in sound cards that support both audio in and out, for instance. Hardware audio codecs send and receive digital data using buses such as AC'97, SoundWire, I\u00b2S, SPI, I\u00b2C, etc. Most commonly the digital data is linear PCM, and this is the only format that most codecs support, but some legacy codecs support other formats such as G.711 for telephony.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54475", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54475", "title": "Video codec", "text": "Digital video coder/decoder\nA video codec is software or hardware that compresses and decompresses digital video. In the context of video compression, \"codec\" is a portmanteau of \"encoder\" and \"decoder\", while a device that only compresses is typically called an \"encoder\", and one that only decompresses is a \"decoder\".\nThe compressed data format usually conforms to a standard video coding format. The compression is typically lossy, meaning that the compressed video lacks some information present in the original video. A consequence of this is that decompressed video has lower quality than the original, uncompressed video because there is insufficient information to accurately reconstruct the original video.\nThere are complex relationships between the video quality, the amount of data used to represent the video (determined by the bit rate), the complexity of the encoding and decoding algorithms, sensitivity to data losses and errors, ease of editing, random access, and end-to-end delay (latency).\nHistory.\nHistorically, video was stored as an analog signal on magnetic tape. Around the time when the compact disc entered the market as a digital-format replacement for analog audio, it became feasible to also store and convey video in digital form. Because of the large amount of storage and bandwidth needed to record and convey raw video, a method was needed to reduce the amount of data used to represent the raw video. Since then, engineers and mathematicians have developed a number of solutions for achieving this goal that involve compressing the digital video data.\nIn 1974, discrete cosine transform (DCT) compression was introduced by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao. During the late 1980s, a number of companies began experimenting with DCT lossy compression for video coding, leading to the development of the H.261 standard. H.261 was the first practical video coding standard, and was developed by a number of companies, including Hitachi, PictureTel, NTT, BT, and Toshiba, among others. Since H.261, DCT compression has been adopted by all the major video coding standards that followed.\nThe most popular video coding standards used for codecs have been the MPEG standards. MPEG-1 was developed by the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) in 1991, and it was designed to compress VHS-quality video. It was succeeded in 1994 by MPEG-2/H.262, which was developed by a number of companies, primarily Sony, Thomson and Mitsubishi Electric. MPEG-2 became the standard video format for DVD and SD digital television. In 1999, it was followed by MPEG-4/H.263, which was a major leap forward for video compression technology. It was developed by a number of companies, primarily Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi and Panasonic.\nThe most widely used video coding format, as of 2016, is H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. It was developed in 2003 by a number of organizations, primarily Panasonic, Godo Kaisha IP Bridge and LG Electronics. H.264 is the main video encoding standard for Blu-ray Discs, and is widely used by streaming internet services such as YouTube, Netflix, Vimeo, and iTunes Store, web software such as Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight, and various HDTV broadcasts over terrestrial and satellite television.\nAVC has been succeeded by HEVC (H.265), developed in 2013. It is heavily patented, with the majority of patents belonging to Samsung Electronics, GE, NTT and JVC Kenwood. The adoption of HEVC has been hampered by its complex licensing structure. HEVC is in turn succeeded by Versatile Video Coding (VVC).\nThere are also the open and free VP8, VP9 and AV1 video coding formats, used by YouTube, all of which were developed with involvement from Google.\nApplications.\nVideo codecs are used in DVD players, Internet video, video on demand, digital cable, digital terrestrial television, videotelephony and a variety of other applications. In particular, they are widely used in applications that record or transmit video, which may not be feasible with the high data volumes and bandwidths of uncompressed video. For example, they are used in operating theaters to record surgical operations, in IP cameras in security systems, and in remotely operated underwater vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Any video stream or file can be encoded using a wide variety of live video format options. Here are some of the H.264 encoder settings that need to be set when streaming to an HTML5 video player.\nVideo codec design.\nVideo codecs seek to represent a fundamentally analog data set in a digital format. Because of the design of analog video signals, which represent luminance (luma) and color information (chrominance, chroma) separately, a common first step in image compression in codec design is to represent and store the image in a YCbCr color space. The conversion to YCbCr provides two benefits: first, it improves compressibility by providing decorrelation of the color signals; and second, it separates the luma signal, which is perceptually much more important, from the chroma signal, which is less perceptually important and which can be represented at lower resolution using chroma subsampling to achieve more efficient data compression. It is common to represent the ratios of information stored in these different channels in the following way Y:Cb:Cr. Different codecs use different chroma subsampling ratios as appropriate to their compression needs. Video compression schemes for Web and DVD make use of a 4:2:1 color sampling pattern, and the DV standard uses 4:1:1 sampling ratios. Professional video codecs designed to function at much higher bitrates and to record a greater amount of color information for post-production manipulation sample in 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 ratios. Examples of these codecs include Panasonic's DVCPRO50 and DVCPROHD codecs (4:2:2), Sony's HDCAM-SR (4:4:4), Panasonic's HDD5 (4:2:2), Apple's Prores HQ 422 (4:2:2).\nIt is also worth noting that video codecs can operate in RGB space as well. These codecs tend not to sample the red, green, and blue channels in different ratios, since there is less perceptual motivation for doing so\u2014just the blue channel could be undersampled.\nSome amount of spatial and temporal downsampling may also be used to reduce the raw data rate before the basic encoding process. The most popular encoding transform is the 8x8 DCT. Codecs that make use of a wavelet transform are also entering the market, especially in camera workflows that involve dealing with RAW image formatting in motion sequences. This process involves representing the video image as a set of macroblocks. For more information about this critical facet of video codec design, see B-frames.\nThe output of the transform is first quantized, then entropy encoding is applied to the quantized values. When a DCT has been used, the coefficients are typically scanned using a zig-zag scan order, and the entropy coding typically combines a number of consecutive zero-valued quantized coefficients with the value of the next non-zero quantized coefficient into a single symbol and also has special ways of indicating when all of the remaining quantized coefficient values are equal to zero. The entropy coding method typically uses variable-length coding tables. Some encoders compress the video in a multiple-step process called \"n-pass\" encoding (e.g. 2-pass), which performs a slower but potentially higher quality compression.\nThe decoding process consists of performing, to the extent possible, an inversion of each stage of the encoding process. The one stage that cannot be exactly inverted is the quantization stage. There, a best-effort approximation of inversion is performed. This part of the process is often called \"inverse quantization\" or \"dequantization\", although quantization is an inherently non-invertible process.\nVideo codec designs are usually standardized or eventually become standardized\u2014i.e., specified precisely in a published document. However, only the decoding process need be standardized to enable interoperability. The encoding process is typically not specified at all in a standard, and implementers are free to design their encoder however they want, as long as the video can be decoded in the specified manner. For this reason, the quality of the video produced by decoding the results of different encoders that use the same video codec standard can vary dramatically from one encoder implementation to another.\nCommonly used video codecs.\nA variety of video compression formats can be implemented on PCs and in consumer electronics equipment. It is therefore possible for multiple codecs to be available in the same product, reducing the need to choose a single dominant video compression format to achieve interoperability.\nStandard video compression formats can be supported by multiple encoder and decoder implementations from multiple sources. For example, video encoded with a standard MPEG-4 Part 2 codec such as Xvid can be decoded using any other standard MPEG-4 Part 2 codec such as FFmpeg MPEG-4 or DivX Pro Codec, because they all use the same video format.\nCodecs have their qualities and drawbacks. Comparisons are frequently published. The trade-off between compression power, speed, and fidelity (including artifacts) is usually considered the most important figure of technical merit.\nCodec packs.\nOnline video material is encoded by a variety of codecs, and this has led to the availability of codec packs\u00a0\u2014 a pre-assembled set of commonly used codecs combined with an installer available as a software package for PCs, such as K-Lite Codec Pack, Perian and Combined Community Codec Pack.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Video is almost always stored using lossy compression to reduce the file size.\nA video file normally consists of a container (e.g. in the Matroska format) containing visual (video without audio) data in a video coding format (e.g. VP9) alongside audio data in an audio coding format (e.g. Opus). The container can also contain synchronization information, subtitles, and metadata such as title. A standardized (or in some cases de facto standard) video file type such as .webm is a profile specified by a restriction on which container format and which video and audio compression formats are allowed.\nThe coded video and audio inside a video file container (i.e. not headers, footers, and metadata) is called the essence. A program (or hardware) which can decode compressed video or audio is called a codec; playing or encoding a video file will sometimes require the user to install a codec library corresponding to the type of video and audio coding used in the file.\nGood design normally dictates that a file extension enables the user to derive which program will open the file. That is the case with some video file formats, such as WebM (.webm), Windows Media Video (.wmv), Flash Video (.flv), and Ogg Video (.ogv), each of which can only contain a few well-defined subtypes of video and audio coding formats, making it relatively easy to know which codec will play the file. In contrast to that, some very general-purpose container types like AVI (.avi) and QuickTime (.mov) can contain video and audio in almost any format, and have file extensions named after the container type, making it very hard for the end user to use the file extension to derive which codec or program to use to play the files.\nThe free software FFmpeg project's libraries have very wide support for encoding and decoding video file formats. For example, Google uses ffmpeg to support a wide range of upload video formats for YouTube. One widely used media player using the ffmpeg libraries is the free software VLC media player, which can play most video files that end users will encounter."}

{"id": "54481", "revid": "20468248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54481", "title": "Apron", "text": "Outer protective garment\nAn apron is a garment worn over other clothing to cover the front of the body to protect from liquids. They have several purposes, most commonly as a functional accessory that protects clothes and skin from stains and marks. However, other types of aprons may be worn as a decoration, for hygienic reasons, as part of a uniform, or as protection from certain dangers such as acid, allergens or excessive heat. It can also be used at work stations to hold extra tools and pieces or protect from dust and unwanted materials.\nAs a top layer that covers the front body, the apron is also worn as a uniform, adornment, ceremonial garb (e.g. Masonic apron) or fashion statement.\nThe word comes from Old French \"napron\", meaning a small piece of cloth. Over time \"a napron\" became \"an apron\" through a linguistic process called rebracketing.\nStyles.\nThere are many different apron forms depending on the purpose of the apron. A basic distinction is between waist aprons, which cover the body from the waist down, and bib aprons, which also cover the upper part of the body.\nAn apron is usually held in place by two ribbon-like strips of cloth that are tied at the back. A bib apron may either have a strap around the neck (perhaps the most widespread design today), or shoulder straps that criss-cross at the back and attach to the waistband. The advantage of the former design is that it makes it especially simple to put on the bib apron. The advantage of the shoulder strap design is that it makes the apron more comfortable to wear; a neck strap can slightly impair ease of movement.\nSome modern-day aprons have humorous expressions, designs or corporate logos.\nBib apron.\nThe bib apron (also known as the \"French chefs' apron\" or a \"barbecue apron\") has been worn for centuries. The garment's history likely began when people used scraps of fabric to make a bib-like covering that slipped over the neck and tied at the back. The bib apron's intuitive design and full coverage have made it a popular apron for tradesmen and people in low-economic classes since the 1880s\u2014and maybe even earlier. In the 1960s\u2014when women no longer wanted an apron that symbolized domestic ideals\u2014the bib apron became the most-used apron and is now offered in a multitude of variations, colors, detailing and fabrications.\nPinafore.\nPinafores may be worn by girls and women as a decorative garment or as a protective apron. A related term is \"pinafore dress\" (American English: jumper dress); it is a sleeveless dress intended to be worn over a top or blouse.\nA pinafore is a full apron with two holes for the arms that is tied or buttoned in the back, usually just below the neck. Pinafores have complete front shaped over shoulder while aprons usually have no bib, or only a smaller one. A child's garment to wear at school or for play would be a pinafore.\nTabard.\nA tabard (British English; cobbler apron in U.S. English) is a type of apron that covers both the front and back of the body. It is fastened with side ties or with waistbands that tie in the back. It covers most of the upper part of the body and is used in many occupations, like bakeries, hospitals, and large retail stores. The original cobbler's apron was typically made of leather.\nAn alternative version uses snaps instead of ties and closes at the front. Such an apron is in effect like a vest and is more commonly sold for domestic rather than occupational use.\nBungalow apron.\nA bungalow apron is an item of women's at-home clothing. Most bungalow aprons were extremely simple garments, often with kimono sleeves (sleeves cut in one piece with the body of the dress), little or no trim, and the fewest possible fasteners. Most date from the first half of the 20th century (roughly 1910 into the 1940s), when they evolved into or were replaced by the \"patio dress\" or Lounger available today.\nIn contrast to most aprons, they were intended to be worn as a stand-alone garment, not over another dress. They probably developed from the full-coverage wraparound or pullover aprons of the early years of the 20th century.\nBungalow aprons fell roughly between nightgowns or house coats and house-dresses; they were appropriate for morning in-home wear but would not have been worn outside of the house, as opposed to a true morning or house-dress, which might have been worn to the grocery store or in other informal situations.\nClerical garment.\nThe term \"apron\" also refers to an item of clerical clothing, now largely obsolete, worn by Anglican bishops and archdeacons. The clerical apron resembles a short cassock reaching just above the knee, and is colored black for archdeacons and purple for bishops. The apron is worn with black breeches, reaching to just below the knee, and knee-length gaiters. The history behind the vesture is that it symbolically represents the mobility of bishops and archdeacons, who at one time would ride horses to visit various parts of a diocese or archdeaconry. In this sense, the apparel was much more practical than a clerical cassock would be. In latter years, this vesture was more symbolic than practical, and since the mid-twentieth century it has fallen out of favor.\nIn the home.\nThe apron was traditionally viewed as an essential garment for anyone doing housework. Cheaper clothes and washing machines made aprons less common beginning in the mid-1960s in some countries such as the United States. However, the practice of wearing aprons remains strong in many places.\nToday, the apron has enjoyed a minor renaissance in terms of both women and men now wearing them when performing household chores. For instance, an article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" claimed in 2005 that the apron is \"enjoying a renaissance as a retro-chic fashion accessory\" in the United States. However, it still is not as prevalent as it was prior to the 1960s.\nAprons are nowadays considered equally appropriate for both women and men by most people. However, prevailing social norms ensure that women frequently wear more delicate clothing, and may therefore be more likely to want the protection an apron offers. This can also be because the apron is the traditional clothing for cooking and washing dishes, which was usually done by women.\nWhen domestic workers are supplied a uniform by their employers, an apron is often included. The aprons are worn for hygienic as well as for identification purposes.\nProtective and fashionable aprons throughout history.\nSince fabric was precious in the medieval and Renaissance eras, aprons then were little more than scraps of material tied around the waist with the intent of protecting the valuable clothing underneath.\nIn Europe during the Middle Ages, aprons were worn by blacksmiths, armor and weapon makers, gardeners, carvers, furniture makers, leather smiths, cobblers, tailors, jewelers, metal forgers, fishmongers, clock makers, homemakers, tradesmen, artisans and masons. Tradesmen in general were called \"apron men,\" as aprons were so common that distinguishing styles emerged between the various trades. For example, English barbers were known as \"checkered apron men.\" Cobblers wore black to protect garments from the black wax used on shoes. Butchers wore blue stripes. Butlers wore green aprons. Blue was commonly worn by weavers, spinners, and gardeners. Stonemasons wore white aprons as protection against the dust of their trade, and even in the twenty-first century, aprons survive as part of Masonic ceremonial attire. These aprons were long, coming down to below the knees, with a flap or bib to protect the chest. The Union of the Grand Lodge of England between the Ancient and Modern branches of English Freemasonry in 1813 brought into many effect many changes in dress and ritual which still prevail to this day. In respect to the Masonic apron it was felt necessary to have these standardised and the resulting effort are the aprons we have in use today. The Dutch wore aprons bordered with black and with a skull and crossbones on the flap. Scottish lodges each have their individual right to choose the design, colour and shape of their aprons; some employ a tartan, while many others have a circular rather than a triangular flap. Soldiers of the French Foreign Legion wore leather aprons as part of their ceremonial dress as early as the 18th century.\nFrom these utilitarian beginnings, the modern apron got more stylish over time. During the Renaissance, more fanciful aprons crafted from finer fabrics began to appear\u2014usually without bibs and often embroidered. Well-to-do women favored long dresses often with detachable sleeves, and to keep their expensive gowns clean, they wore washable aprons or overdresses in a range of embellishments and materials.\nAprons became a fashion statement in the 1500s, when women started adorning them with expensive lace and embroidery.\nPolitics ruled women's fashion in 1650s England when Oliver Cromwell decreed that women and girls should dress properly. This sparked the Puritan look of a white apron covering a long black dress that reached from a woman's neck to her toes.\nAt the height of the industrial revolution in Victorian England, the market was flooded with different types of aprons. The boom of factories and sewing machines meant that consumers had options: one could choose a full-body apron, a linen apron, a linen apron with ruffles or ruching or lace, a grosgrain apron with embroidery, or an apron with a flounce. Aprons were a way of indicating the difference in status between the employer and the employee, and the uniform of the staff was strictly regulated. For example, a housemaid might wear a print dress during the day and then change into a black dress and dress apron for the evening service.\nIn contemporary South Africa, young women wear beaded aprons to celebrate their coming of age.\nAncient ceremonial aprons.\nExamples of ancient gods wearing aprons can be found worldwide. Fertility goddess figurines may be the earliest depiction of women wearing aprons. These ancient snake goddess figurines excavated in Crete depicted how Minoan women may have dressed in 1600 BCE: a tight bodice, bare breasts, and an embroidered or woven apron covering a long dress. Monuments and wall paintings in Ancient Egypt depict a triangular-shaped apron with the point upward when the wearer is taking part in some kind of ceremony of initiation. In China, some of the ancient figures of the gods wear semi-circular aprons. In Central America the ancient gods are consistently sculpted wearing aprons. Tepoxtecatl (the preserver) is depicted wearing an apron with a triangular flap. Priests wore similar aprons as a sign of their allegiance to the gods and as a badge of their authority.\nIn the United States.\nAprons have been used in North America throughout its recorded history by both the Native Americans and later peoples. The kitchen apron fell somewhat out of favor in the 1960s after its rise to celebrity in the 1950s when it became the post-war symbol for family and domesticity. People started doing their work without an apron entirely or they choose to wear a bib apron (its unisex, simple, boxy design represented the opposite of the 1950s housewife). The bib apron, also known as the \"French chef's apron\" or \"barbecue apron\", remains the dominant apron on the American market and is offered in a multitude of variations in colors, detailing and fabrics.\nEarly American aprons.\nNative American wore aprons for both practical and ceremonial purposes. Early female settlers wore plain, long white aprons. Later, Quaker women wore long and colorful silk aprons.\nAs cities in New England grew, more elaborate options began to appear. Upscale American women in the 18th century wore embroidered aprons that sometimes dipped at the front of the waist (so as to not obscure the bodice of a gown). \n1800s.\nIn England and the United States in the 1800s, both maids and wealthy women wore aprons. Servant aprons were traditionally white and were supposed to be \"clean, neat and appropriate.\" The maid's clothing was meant to follow the fashion trends of the time while also representing her employer's class status and wealth. Some aprons had lace, embroidery or pleating work on them to add a bit of sophistication if they were servants who regularly appeared in front of house guests.\nWealthy housewives of the time were also expected to show off their family's status in society and their commitment to the domestic life. They did this by also wearing aprons, though the aprons were far more elegant and expensive than the maid's white cotton apron. Popular materials included black lace, satin with chenille borders, shot silk, and satin. An apron of this caliber was necessary with a morning dress during the early nineteenth century for a woman of status. During this time, \"never was there a greater rage than for aprons (of satin and shot silk) for morning or afternoon.\" The elegant and colorful apron was also a symbol that a woman had the funds to be swindled by travelling merchants into purchasing \"a gaudy ribbon or shining pair scissors.\"\nAnother symbol which the extravagant apron represented was of the \"fig leaf,\" as worn by Eve in the Garden of Eden. Women termed their ornamental aprons \"fig leaves,\" thus drawing attention to their \"sexual region.\" Small decorated aprons were one example of \"suggestive fashion.\" According to at least one private journal entry, men of the time were reputed to loudly exclaim, \"Oh my!\" upon spotting a woman in a \"fig leaf\" apron, sometimes blushing profusely and fainting on the spot.\nAprons for both maids and housewives were not just worn in the home, but out on the town as well. The painting \"Scene in Frankfurt Fair, April 1835. Part of the Line of Stalls Extending Along the River Mayn\" by Mary Ellen Best shows a mother in a highly decorated and colorful apron and her daughter in a green pinafore apron. They are out shopping in a market and through the appearance of their stylish aprons, they are exhibiting their upper-middle class status as well as their ties to female domesticity.\n1920s.\nFrom 1900 through the 1920s, well-heeled women wore ornate, heavily embroidered aprons. Aprons of the 1920s mirror the style of the times: loose and long. Often closed with a button and adorned with needlework, many aprons styles emerged during this era and stores began selling patterns and kits to make and adorn aprons at home.\nAprons of this period followed the silhouette of dapper fashions\u2014long, with no waist line.\n1930s \u2013 1940s.\nThe \u201cHooverette\u201d or \u201cHoover apron\u201d was named after the man in charge of the U.S. Food Administration at the time, Herbert Hoover. Women working outside the home wore whatever protective garments their jobs required, including coveralls, smocks, or aprons. At home, they worked in full-length aprons with hefty pockets and a cinched waistline that were often decorated with buttons, pockets and contrasting colors.\nAprons became plain during the Great Depression. Since fabric was scarce, women would make aprons out of flour and animal-feed sacks to protect their clothing. Pinafore aprons, or \"pinnies\" as they were affectionately called, began to gain popularity. Dorothy famously wore a blue and white gingham pinafore in \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n1950s.\nPost-war family values made the apron the symbol of home, family, mother and wife. As sewing machines and cloth became available, aprons\u2014both commercial and homemade\u2014became the uniform of the professional housewife. Magazines from the 1940s and 50s feature apron-adorned women in nearly every advertisement that is related to housework or cooking, including those for irons, kitchen appliances, and food products. The 1950s brought out the half-aprons of highly starched cotton, feedsack, and for special occasions sheer fabric trimmed with lace. Two-piece aprons and short smocks of bright cotton prints for everyday use were also popular.\nThe postwar archetypal housewife was practical and creative. She made aprons out of remnants, extra kitchen curtains, dish towels, handkerchiefs, and flour sacks. When she made her aprons, she considered design as well as function. Many 1950s aprons were decorated with sewing, cleaning, cooking, and \"mom\" themes.\nHusbands in the 1950s often sported bib aprons for barbecues on the weekends, often with written statements about Dad's grilling talents.\n1960s \u2013 1970s.\nAprons fell out of favor as women began looking again beyond the home and family for fulfillment as the feminist movement of the latter half of the 20th century began. In response, people chose to wear no apron when they did their work, or they wore bib aprons that were less stereotypically feminine, sometimes with ironic or sarcastic statements written on them.\nAprons remained a staple of the workplace as a means of protecting garments. Aprons were also worn as a work uniform and by people who worked in the food trades\u2014butchers, waitresses and chefs as well as hairdressers and barbers.\n1980s \u2013 today.\nMany home cooks chose not to wear an apron in the 1980s. Those that did often wore bib aprons or vintage/retro DIY aprons. However, more recently the apron has again enjoyed increasing popularity. Employees in the service industry continue to wear aprons for work, often a bib apron with company logos. Today there is no negative social stigma associated with doing one's own chores (e.g. cooking, cleaning) or pursuing messy hobbies or careers (e.g. styling, gardening, painting) .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54487", "revid": "51042985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54487", "title": "Homemaking", "text": "Act of overseeing the organizational, financial, day-to-day operations of a house or estate\nHomemaking is mainly an American and Canadian term for the management of a home, otherwise known as housework, housekeeping, housewifery or household management. It is the act of overseeing the organizational, day-to-day operations of a house or estate, and the managing of other domestic concerns. A person in charge of the homemaking, who is not employed outside the home, in the US and Canada, is called a homemaker, a term for a housewife or a stay-at-home dad. Historically, the role of homemaker was often assumed by women. The term \"homemaker\", however, may also refer to a social worker who manages a household during the incapacity of the housewife or househusband. Home health workers assume the role of homemakers when caring for elderly individuals. This includes preparing meals, giving baths, and any duties the person in need cannot perform for themselves.\nHomemaking can be the full-time responsibility of one spouse, partner, or parent, shared with children or extended family, or shared or traded between spouses/partners as one or both work outside the home. It can also be outsourced partially or completely to paid help. In previous decades, there were a number of mandatory courses available for students to learn the skills of homemaking. In high school, courses included cooking, nutrition, home economics, family and consumer science (FACS), and food and cooking hygiene. \nMarriage.\n19th century.\nIn North America, early 19th-century ideals required homemaking be the responsibility of the woman; \"the wife is properly supposed to be the light and centre of the home.\" Traditional wives who stayed home and did not work for pay were required by social ideals to create and maintain a peaceful space to provide to her husband and children. For women in a pre-modern environment, \"it is the duty and privilege and solemn responsibility, which make this art of home-making more interesting and important to her than any other art in the world.\" Author of these statements, Annie Swan was not alone in the late 1800s viewpoint that women were encouraged, if not required, to maintain the home solely themselves. In 1875, Harper's Bazaar published an article outlining the duties of a housewife and the esteemed respect those duties deserve: \"but if one only staid to think how countless and how onerous those duties really are, more respect would be paid to the faithful effort to perform them, and an added reverence extended to the mother who is also the housekeeper.\" Harper's Bazaar recognizes that women do the majority of the work within the home, pointing out that the work is detailed and at many times, difficult.\n20th century.\nThe 20th century began with similar homemaking roles as the 19th; however, the century concluded with a much different perception. In the late 1990s, marriage consisted in most cases of both wife and husband participating in homemaking. Darlene Pi\u00f1a and Vern Bengtson who are anthropologists and professors at the University of Southern California, extensively researched marriage dynamics and household labor in the late twentieth century. They concluded that \"all wives benefit equally by their husbands' greater involvement in household labor.\" The division of labor within the home promotes a healthy relationship between husband and wife. Concluding, that likelihood of increased happiness within marriage is vastly improved when homemaking is shared with the husband. West and Zimmerman, concluded an analysis of over 487 couples and found that \"women were rewarded for performing feminine behaviors, such as housework, whereas men receive positive reinforcement for engaging in masculine tasks, such as breadwinning.\"\nIn contrast, a study performed by Hochschild in 1989, concluded that even when wives contributed more than 50% of the household income they often still performed more household labor than their husbands. Hochschild's study directly debunked the previous theory that women performed housework because they contributed significantly less to household income. Instead, the results of the study indicated that even in marriage dynamics where women contributed more than half of the household income, they still completed the vast majority of homemaking tasks.\nMarried women who are economically and emotionally dependent on their husbands are less likely to report the division of household labor as unfair. This significant group of married women felt that household labor reinforced their female gender identity and connection to femininity.\n21st century.\nSex and gender continue to shape the division of household responsibilities in the United States in the twenty-first century. According to the 2018 American Time Use Survey, 84 percent of women and 69 percent of men reported that they spent some time performing household duties, which included \"housework, cooking, lawn care, or household management.\" Women reported spending an average of 2.6 hours a day on household activities, and men 2.0 hours. On a surveyed day, 49% percent of women and 20% of men reported doing housework.\nMen and women's perception of household responsibilities differ. Pew Research Center's 2014 Religious Landscape Study found that fathers were more likely than mothers to say that chores were evenly split between both partners (56% vs. 46%). When asked, 50% of mothers reported they handled more responsibilities around the house than their partners; only 12% of fathers reported they did more household tasks. Despite this difference in perception, a majority of married U.S. adults (56%) said that sharing household chores as \"very important\" to a successful marriage.\nIn a 2008 article, social scientists Susan L. Brown and Sayaka Kawamura reported that the unequal distribution in housework was attributed mainly to time availability. They concluded: \"wives typically work fewer hours than their husbands, [so] they have more time available to perform household tasks.\"\nHousekeeping.\nHousekeeping by the homemaker is the care and control of property, ensuring its maintenance, proper use and appearance. In a private home a maid or housekeeper is sometimes employed to do some of the housekeeping. Housework is work done by the act of housekeeping. Some housekeeping is housecleaning and some housekeeping is home chores. Home chores are housework that needs to be done at regular intervals. Housekeeping includes the budget and control of expenditures, preparing meals and buying food, paying the heat bill, and cleaning the house.\nCooking.\nMost modern-day houses contain sanitary facilities and a means of preparing food. A kitchen is a room or part of a room used by the homemaker for cooking, food preparation and food preservation. In the West, a modern kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, an oven, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator and kitchen cabinets. Many homemakers use a microwave oven, a dishwasher and other electric appliances like blender and convection cooker and automatic appliances like rice cookers. The main function of a kitchen is cooking or preparing food but it may also be used for dining for a casual meal such as lunch.\nCooking is the process of preparing food, making, selecting, measuring and combining ingredients in an ordered procedure for producing safe and edible food. The process encompasses a vast range of methods, tools and combinations of ingredients to alter the flavor, appearance, texture, or digestibility of food. Factors affecting the outcome include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, tools, and the skill of the individual doing the actual cooking.\nThe diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, social and religious diversity of people across the globe. Applying heat to a food usually, though not always, chemically transforms it, thus changing its flavor, texture, consistency, appearance, and nutritional properties. Methods of cooking that involve the boiling of liquid in a receptacle have been practised at least since the 10th millennium BC, with the introduction of pottery.\nCleaning.\nHouse cleaning by the homemaker is the systematic process of making a home neat and clean. This may be applied more broadly than just an individual home, such as a metaphor for a similar \"clean up\" process applied elsewhere such as at a hotel or as a procedural reform. In the process of house cleaning general cleaning activities are completed, such as disposing of rubbish, storing of belongings in regular places, cleaning dirty surfaces, dusting and vacuuming. The details of this are various and complicated enough that many books have been published on the subject. How-to sites on the internet have many articles on house cleaning. Tools include the vacuum cleaner, broom and mop. Supplies such as cleaning solutions and sponges are sold in grocery stores and elsewhere. Professional cleaners can be hired for less frequent or specialist tasks such as cleaning blinds, rugs, and sofas. Professional services are also offered for the basic tasks. Safety is a consideration because some cleaning products are toxic and some cleaning tasks are physically demanding. \"Green cleaning\" refers to cleaning without causing pollution or chemicals that may cause bodily harm. The history of house cleaning has links to the advancement of technology.\nOutdoor housecleaning chores include removing leaves from rain gutters, washing windows, sweeping doormats, cleaning the pool, putting away lawn furniture, and taking out the trash.\nLaundry.\nLaundry refers to the act of washing clothing and linens, the place where that washing is done, and/or that which needs to be, is being, or has been laundered. Various chemicals may be used to increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in soaproot or yucca-root used by Native American tribes. Soap, a compound made from lye (from wood-ash) and fat, is an ancient and very common laundry aid. Modern washing machines typically use powdered or liquid laundry detergent in place of more traditional soap. Once clean, the clothes are dried.\nWashing machines and dryers are now fixtures in homes around the world. In some parts of the world, including the US, Canada, and Switzerland, apartment buildings and dormitories often have laundry rooms, where residents share washing machines and dryers. Usually the machines are set to run only when money is put in a coin slot. In other parts of the world, apartment buildings with laundry rooms are uncommon, and each apartment may have its own washing machine. Those without a machine at home or the use of a laundry room must either wash their clothes by hand or visit a commercial laundromat.\nA clothes dryer is a household appliance that is used to remove moisture from a load of clothing and other textiles, generally shortly after they are cleaned in a washing machine. Most dryers consist of a rotating drum called a tumbler through which heated air is circulated to evaporate the moisture from the load. The tumbler is rotated relatively slowly in order to maintain space between the articles in the load. In most cases, the tumbler is belt-driven by an induction motor. Using these machines may cause clothes to shrink, become less soft (due to loss of short soft fibers/ lint) and fade. For these reasons, as well as environmental concerns, many people use open air methods such as a clothes line and clotheshorse.\nLaundry starch is used in the laundering of clothes. Starch was widely used in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and ruffs of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the well-to-do. During the 19th century and early 20th century, it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of men's shirts and the ruffles of girls' petticoats by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being ironed. Aside from the smooth, crisp edges it gave to clothing, it served practical purposes as well. Dirt and sweat from a person's neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing, and would easily wash away along with the starch. After each laundering, the starch would be reapplied. Today the product is sold in aerosol cans for home use. Kitchen starch used as a thickening agent for food can also be applied to laundered fabrics (requires boiling).\nMaintenance.\nHomemakers that follow predictive maintenance techniques determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach offers cost savings over routine or time-based maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted. Homemakers that follow preventive maintenance methods ensure that household equipment and the house are in satisfactory operating condition by providing for inspection, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects.\nHome maintenance.\nHome maintenance involves the diagnosis and resolution of problems in a home, and is related to home maintenance to avoid such problems. Many types of maintenance are \"Do it yourself\" (DIY) projects. Maintenance is not necessarily the same as home improvement, although many improvements can result from repairs or maintenance. Often the costs of larger repairs will justify the alternative of investment in full-scale improvements. It may make just as much sense to upgrade a home system (with an improved one) as to repair it or incur ever-more-frequent and expensive maintenance for an inefficient, obsolete or dying system. For a DIY project, also useful is the established limits on time and money investments before a repair (or list of repairs) become overwhelming and discouraging, and less likely to ever be completed.\nLawn maintenance.\nHomemakers who have a lawn responsibility adhere to seasonal lawn care practices, which vary to some extent depending on the climate zone and type of grass that is grown (whether cool season or warm season varieties). Various recognized method used by homemakers in lawn care are observed in any area. In spring or early summer, homemakers seed, sod, or sprig a yard when the ground is warmer. In summer lawn mowers are used at high cutting for cool season grass, and lower cutting for warm season lawns. In autumn, lawns are mown by homemakers at a lower height and thatch build-up that occurs in warm season grasses are removed. Homemakers do add sandy loam and apply fertilizer, containing some type of wetting agent. Cool season lawns are planted in the autumn with adequate rainfall. Lawn care in the winter is minimal, requiring only light feedings of organic material, such as green-waste compost, and minerals to encourage earthworms and beneficial microbes.\nManagement.\nHousehold management by the homemaker is the act of overseeing the organizational, financial, and day-to-day operations of a house or estate. It differs from housekeeping, which consists of the physical maintenance and cleaning of a house.\nHouse organization.\nHouse organization or home organization includes interior design to make the home aesthetically pleasing by arranging furniture, plants, blinds, and so forth. De-cluttering means removing unnecessary things from the house.\nDe-cluttering.\nHousehold de-cluttering involves putting things in their proper place after they have been used. \"Cleaning up your mess\" might involve removing glasses, eating utensils or gadgets i.e. toys from the living room if you have eaten a meal there in front of the television. If several people have done that over a few days and not removed their glasses, dishes and utensils from the living room, the living room is considered to be \"cluttered\" with dishes. The dishes are out of place because they belong in the kitchen, washed and put away in the cupboards. That is the most common example of clutter in a modern North American household.\nThere is another definition of clutter, which refers to having simply too many things and not enough room for all of it. Sometimes as happens in Asian households, the items are necessary, but the home is simply too small, and ingenious methods are needed to organize everything to minimize unsightly clutter. Removing unneeded or no longer necessary objects from a household or home is also an aspect of de-cluttering. Objects can be given away to friends or charitable organizations, sold as second-hand, recycled or thrown away.\nExtreme forms of an inability to de-clutter is a behavioral aspect of compulsive hoarding. On the other end, a society that relies overly much on generating and then disposing of waste is referred to as a throw-away society.\nHousehold purchasing.\nHousehold purchasing refers to a homemaker's efforts to acquire goods or services to accomplish the goals of the household. Though there are several households that attempt to set standards in the purchasing process, processes can vary greatly between households. Typically the word \"purchasing\" is not used interchangeably with the word \"procurement\", since procurement typically includes other concepts. Homemakers decide the market goods that the household will buy, such as the groceries which have been bought at a grocer's or supermarket.\nAnother important purchase handled by homemakers is the power source used for appliances. Home or other building heating may include boilers, furnaces, and water heaters. Compressed natural gas is used in rural homes without connections to piped-in public utility services, or with portable grills. However, due to being less economical than LPG, LPG (Propane) is the dominant source of rural gas for natural gas-powered ranges and/or ovens, natural gas-heated clothes dryers, heating/cooling and central heating. The amount of usages is determined by factors such as natural gas prices.\nServants.\nHomemakers may manage household workers or \"domestic workers\".\nWork strategies.\nIn sociology, \"household work strategy\" is the division of labour between members of a household, whether implicit or the result of explicit decision\u2013making, with the alternatives weighed up in a simplified type of cost-benefit analysis. It is a plan for the relative deployment of household members' time between the three domains of employment:\nHousehold work strategies may vary over the life-cycle, as household members age, or with the economic environment; they may be imposed by one person or be decided collectively.\nHousehold production.\n\"Household production\" is an economic category for activities including homemaking. It is defined as \"the production of the goods and services by the members of a household, for their own consumption, using their own capital and their own unpaid labor. Goods and services produced by households for their own use include accommodation, meals, clean clothes, and child care. The process of household production involves the transformation of purchased intermediate commodities into final consumption commodities. Households use their own capital and their own labor.\"\nThere are efforts to construct estimates of the value of household production in a way analogous to GDP, though the category is not usually included in GDP. Goods and services created by households are generally consumed within the same country, and hence contribute in a \"Domestic Consumption\" category in national accounts.\nWages for housework.\nThe International Wages for Housework Campaign was a global, social movement co-founded in 1972 in Padua, Italy, by author and activist Selma James. The Campaign was formed to raise awareness of how housework and childcare are the base of all industrial work and to stake the claim that these unavoidable tasks should be compensated as paid, wage labor. The demands for the Wages for Housework formally called for economic compensation for domestic work but also used these demands to more generally call attention to the affective labors of women, the reliance of capitalist economies on exploitative labor practices against women, and leisure inequality.\nEffects of technology and advertising.\nMany home appliances have been invented that make housework faster or more effective compared to before the Industrial Revolution. These include:\nUtilities can potentially eliminate work like gathering and chopping firewood, shoveling coal, fetching water from outdoors, and heating cold tap water.\nHistorian Ruth Schwartz Cowan estimated that homemakers in the 1800s performed about 50\u201360 hours of work per week, and that this is the same as the 1990s. She says that, rather than reducing the amount of time devoted to housework, labor-saving devices have been used to make the same amount of time do more work, such as by vacuuming a rug instead of sweeping it, or washing fabrics more frequently. Modern parents also more frequently transport their children to after-school activities, and doctors no longer make house calls.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Officially Cape Kennedy from 1963 to 1973, it lies east of Merritt Island, separated from it by the Banana River. It is part of a region known as the Space Coast, and is the site of the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Since many U.S. spacecraft have been launched from both the station and the Kennedy Space Center on adjacent Merritt Island, the two are sometimes conflated with each other.\nOther features of the cape include Port Canaveral, one of the busiest cruise ports in the world, and the Cape Canaveral Lighthouse. The city of Cape Canaveral lies just south of the Port Canaveral District. Mosquito Lagoon, the Indian River, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and Canaveral National Seashore are also features of this area.\nHistory.\nHumans have occupied the area for at least 12,000 years.\nDuring the middle Archaic period, from 5000 BC to 2000 BC, the Mount Taylor period culture region covered northeast Florida, including the area around Cape Canaveral. Late in the Archaic period, from 2000 BC to 500 BC, the Mount Taylor culture was succeeded by the Orange culture, which was among the earliest cultures in North America to produce pottery. The Orange culture was followed by the St. Johns culture, from 500 BC until after European contact. The area around the Indian River was in the Indian River variant of the St. Johns culture, with influences from the Belle Glade culture to the south.\nDuring the first Spanish colonial period the area around the Indian River, to the south of Cape Canaveral, was occupied by the Ais people, while the area around the Mosquito Lagoon, to the north of the Cape, was occupied by the Surruque people. The Surruque were allied with the Ais, but it is not clear whether the Surruque spoke a Timucua language, or a language related to the Ais language.\nIn the early 16th century, Cape Canaveral was noted on maps, although without being named. It was named by Spanish explorers in the first half of the 16th century as . The name \"Canaveral\" ( in Spanish, meaning 'reed bed' or 'sugarcane plantation') is the third oldest surviving European place name in the United States. The first application of the name, according to the Smithsonian Institution, was from the 1521\u20131525 explorations of Spanish explorer Francisco Gordillo. A point of land jutting out into an area of the Atlantic Ocean with swift currents, it became a landing spot for many shipwrecked sailors. An early alternative name was \"Cape of Currents\". By at least 1564, the name appeared on maps.\nEnglish privateer John Hawkins and his journalist John Sparke gave an account of their landing at Cape Canaveral in the 16th century. A Presbyterian missionary was wrecked here and lived among the Indians. Other histories tell of French survivors from Jean Ribault's colony at Fort Caroline, whose ship the wrecked on the shores of Cape Canaveral in 1565, and built a fort from its timbers.\nIn December 1571, Pedro Men\u00e9ndez was wrecked off the Coast of Cape Canaveral and encountered the Ais Indians. From 1605 to 1606, the Spanish Governor of Florida Pedro de Ibarra sent Alvaro Mexia on a diplomatic mission to the Ais Indian nation. The mission was a success; diplomatic ties were made and an agreement for the Ais to receive ransoms for all the shipwrecked sailors they returned.\nThe first Cape Canaveral Lighthouse was completed in January 1848 to warn ships of the coral shoals off the coast.\nThe hurricane of August 1885, pushed a \"wall of water\" over the barrier island (elevation, ) devastating Cape Canaveral and adjacent areas. The ocean waves flooded the homesteaders and discouraged further settlement in the area. The beach near the lighthouse was severely eroded prompting its relocation west inland.\nThe 1890 graduating class of Harvard University started a gun club called the \"Canaveral Club\" at the Cape. This was founded by C. B. Horton of Boston and George H. Reed. A number of distinguished visitors including presidents Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison were reported to have stayed here. In the 1920s, the grand building fell into disrepair and later burned to the ground.\nIn the 20th century, several communities sprang up in Cape Canaveral with names like Canaveral, Canaveral Harbor, Artesia and De Soto Beach. While the area was predominantly a farming and fishing community, some visionaries saw its potential as a resort for vacationers. However, the stock market crash of 1929 hampered its development. In the 1930s, a group of wealthy journalists started a community called \"Journalista Beach\", now called Avon by the Sea. The Brossier brothers built houses in this area and started a publication entitled the \"Evening Star Reporter\" that was the forerunner of the \"Orlando Sentinel\".\nConstruction of Port Canaveral for military and commercial purposes was started in July 1950 and dedicated on November 4, 1953. Congress approved the construction of a deep-water port in 1929, half a century after it was first petitioned by the U.S. Navy in 1878. It is now the major deep-water port of Central Florida.\nRocket launch site.\nCape Canaveral became the test site for missiles when the legislation for the Joint Long Range Proving Ground was passed by the 81st Congress and signed by President Harry Truman on May 11, 1949. Work began on May 9, 1950, under a contract with the Duval Engineering Company of Jacksonville, Florida, to build the Cape's first paved access road and its first permanent launch site.\nThe first rocket launched at the Cape was a V-2 rocket named Bumper 8 from Launch Complex 3 on July 24, 1950. On February 6, 1959, the first successful test firing of a Titan intercontinental ballistic missile was accomplished. NASA's Project Mercury and Gemini space flights were launched from Cape Canaveral, as were Apollo flights using the Saturn I and Saturn IB rockets.\nCape Canaveral was chosen for rocket launches to take advantage of the Earth's rotation. The linear velocity of the Earth's surface is greatest towards the equator; the relatively southerly location of the cape allows rockets to take advantage of this by launching eastward, in the same direction as the Earth's rotation. It is also highly desirable to have the downrange area sparsely populated, in case of accidents; an ocean is ideal for this. The east coast of Florida has logistical advantages over potential competing sites. The Spaceport Florida Launch Complex 46 of the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station is the easternmost near the tip of the cape.\nIn 1999, the North American Numbering Plan Administration allocated telephone area code 321 (as in a launch countdown) to the Cape Canaveral area in homage to its spacefaring heritage.\nName changes.\nA post office in the area was built and listed in the U.S. Post Office application as \"Artesia\" and retained this name from 1893 to 1954. It was \"Port Canaveral\" from 1954 to 1962, and then the City of Cape Canaveral from 1962 to 1963, when a larger post office was built.\nIn 1963, President Lyndon Johnson issued an executive order renaming the area \"Cape Kennedy\", after President John F. Kennedy, who had set the goal of landing on the Moon. After Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, his widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, suggested to Johnson that renaming the Cape Canaveral facility would be an appropriate memorial. Johnson recommended the renaming of the entire cape, announced in a televised address on November 28, 1963, six days after the assassination, on Thanksgiving evening. Accordingly, Cape Canaveral was officially renamed Cape Kennedy. Kennedy's last visit to the space facility was on November 16, 1963, six days before his death;\n the final Mercury mission had concluded six months earlier.\nAlthough the name change was approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names of the Department of the Interior in December 1963, it was not popular in Florida from the outset, especially in the bordering city of Cape Canaveral. In May 1973, the Florida Legislature passed a law restoring the former 400-year-old name, and the Board went along. The name restoration to Cape Canaveral became official on October 9, 1973. Senator Ted Kennedy had stated in 1970 that it was a matter to be decided by the citizens of Florida. The Kennedy family issued a letter stating they \"understood the decision\". NASA's Kennedy Space Center retains the \"Kennedy\" name.\nThe Gemini, Apollo, and the first Skylab missions were all launched while the area was named Cape Kennedy. The first crewed launch under the restored name of Cape Canaveral was Skylab\u00a04, the final Skylab mission, on November 16, 1973.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54492", "revid": "50315452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54492", "title": "Second Battle of Bull Run", "text": "1862 American Civil War battle\nThe Second Battle of Bull Run or Battle of Second Manassas was fought August 28\u201330, 1862, in Prince William County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. It was the culmination of the Northern Virginia campaign waged by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia against Union Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia, and a battle of much larger scale and numbers than the First Battle of Bull Run (or First Manassas) fought on July 21, 1861, on the same ground.\nFollowing a wide-ranging flanking march, Confederate Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson captured the Union supply depot at Manassas Junction, threatening Pope's line of communications with Washington, D.C. Withdrawing a few miles to the northwest, Jackson took up strong concealed defensive positions on Stony Ridge and awaited the arrival of the wing of Lee's army commanded by Maj. Gen. James Longstreet. On August 28, 1862, Jackson attacked a Union column just east of Gainesville, at Brawner's Farm, resulting in a stalemate but successfully getting Pope's attention. On that same day, Longstreet broke through light Union resistance in the Battle of Thoroughfare Gap and approached the battlefield.\nPope became convinced that he had trapped Jackson and concentrated the bulk of his army against him. On August 29, Pope launched a series of assaults against Jackson's position along an unfinished railroad grade. The attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties on both sides. At noon, Longstreet arrived on the field from Thoroughfare Gap and took position on Jackson's right flank. On August 30, Pope renewed his attacks, seemingly unaware that Longstreet was on the field. When massed Confederate artillery devastated a Union assault by Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps, Longstreet's wing of 25,000 men in five divisions counterattacked in the largest simultaneous mass assault of the war. The Union left flank was crushed and the army was driven back to Bull Run. Only an effective Union rear guard action prevented a replay of the First Manassas defeat. Pope's retreat to Centreville was nonetheless precipitous.\nSuccess in this battle emboldened Lee to initiate the ensuing Maryland campaign.\nBackground.\nMilitary situation.\nAfter the collapse of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Peninsula campaign in the Seven Days Battles of June 1862, President Abraham Lincoln appointed John Pope to command the newly formed Army of Virginia. Pope had achieved some success in the Western Theater, and Lincoln sought a more aggressive general than McClellan.\nPlans.\nPope's mission was to fulfill two basic objectives: protect Washington and the Shenandoah Valley; and draw Confederate forces away from McClellan by moving in the direction of Gordonsville. Based on his experience fighting McClellan in the Seven Days, Robert E. Lee perceived that McClellan was no further threat to him on the Virginia Peninsula, so he felt no compulsion to keep all of his forces in direct defense of Richmond. This allowed him to relocate Jackson to Gordonsville to block Pope and protect the Virginia Central Railroad.\nLee had larger plans in mind. Since the Union army was split between McClellan and Pope and they were widely separated, Lee saw an opportunity to destroy Pope before returning his attention to McClellan. He committed Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to join Jackson with 12,000 men.\nInitial movements in the Northern Virginia campaign.\nOn August 3, General-in-Chief Henry Halleck directed McClellan to begin his final withdrawal from the Peninsula and to return to Northern Virginia to support Pope. McClellan protested and did not begin his redeployment until August 14.\nOn August 9, Nathaniel Banks's corps attacked Jackson at Cedar Mountain, gaining an early advantage, but a Confederate counterattack led by A.P. Hill drove Banks back across Cedar Creek. Jackson's advance was stopped, however, by the Union division of Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts. By now Jackson had learned that Pope's corps were all together, foiling his plan of defeating each in separate actions. He remained in position until August 12, then withdrew to Gordonsville. On August 13, Lee sent Longstreet to reinforce Jackson.\nPrelude to battle.\nFrom August 22 to 25, the two armies fought a series of minor actions along the Rappahannock River. Heavy rains had swollen the river and Lee was unable to force a crossing. By this time, reinforcements from the Army of the Potomac were arriving from the Peninsula. Lee's new plan in the face of all these additional forces outnumbering him was to send Jackson and Stuart with half of the army on a flanking march to cut Pope's line of communication, the Orange &amp; Alexandria Railroad. Pope would be forced to retreat and could be defeated while moving and vulnerable. Jackson departed on August 25 and reached Salem (present-day Marshall) that night.\nOn the evening of August 26, after passing around Pope's right flank via Thoroughfare Gap, Jackson's wing of the army struck the Orange &amp; Alexandria Railroad at Bristoe Station and before daybreak on August 27 marched to capture and destroy the massive Union supply depot at Manassas Junction. This surprise movement forced Pope into an abrupt retreat from his defensive line along the Rappahannock. During the night of August 27\u201328, Jackson marched his divisions north to the First Bull Run (Manassas) battlefield, where he took position behind an unfinished railroad grade below Stony Ridge. The defensive position was a good one. The heavy woods allowed the Confederates to conceal themselves, while maintaining good observation points of the Warrenton Turnpike, the likely avenue of Union movement, only a few hundred yards to the south. There were good approach roads for Longstreet to join Jackson, or for Jackson to retreat to the Bull Run Mountains if he could not be reinforced in time. Finally, the unfinished railroad grade offered cuts and fills that could be used as ready-made entrenchments.\nIn the Battle of Thoroughfare Gap on August 28, Longstreet's wing broke through light Union resistance and marched through the gap to join Jackson. This seemingly inconsequential action virtually ensured Pope's defeat during the coming battles because it allowed the two wings of Lee's army to unite on the Manassas battlefield.\nOpposing forces.\nUnion.\nGen. Pope's Army of Virginia of approximately 51,000 men was divided into three army corps:\nThe I Corps, under Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel consisted of the divisions of:\nThe II Corps, under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks\nThe III Corps, Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell, who had led the losing Union army at First Bull Run, consisted of the divisions of:\nThe Kanawha Division (detachment) and parts of three army corps of Gen. McClellan's Army of the Potomac, eventually joined Pope for combat operations, raising his strength to 77,000:\nThe III Corps, under Maj. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman, consisted of the divisions of:\nThe V Corps under Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter, consisted of the divisions of:\nThe VI Corps under Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin\nThe IX Corps under Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno, consisted of the divisions of:\nConfederate.\nOn the Confederate side, Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was organized into two \"wings\" or \"commands\" totaling about 55,000 men:\nMaj. Gen. James Longstreet's Right Wing or Command consisted of the following divisions:\nMaj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's Left Wing or Command consisted of the following divisions:\nAn exact estimate of both armies' strength at the battle is not possible as different reports and returns provide differing figures. The total strength of the Army of Northern Virginia, cavalry and artillery included, was slightly less than 55,000 men. Factoring in only infantry, the effective Confederate strength was probably about 50,000 men, possibly as low as 47,000. Union strength was around 63,000 men if Banks's corps is excluded as it was not present at the battle aside from a few detachments. The total Union strength with Banks added in was approximately 70,000 men.\nBattle.\nAugust 28: Brawner's Farm (Groveton).\nThe Second Battle of Bull Run began on August 28 as a Federal column, under Jackson's observation just outside Gainesville, near the farm of the John Brawner family, moved along the Warrenton Turnpike. It consisted of units from Brig. Gen. Rufus King's division: the brigades of Brig. Gens. John P. Hatch, John Gibbon, Abner Doubleday, and Marsena R. Patrick, marching eastward to concentrate with the rest of Pope's army at Centreville. King was not with his division because he had suffered a serious epileptic attack earlier that day.\nJackson, who had been relieved to hear earlier that Longstreet's men were on their way to join him, displayed himself prominently to the Union troops, by riding up next to the marching Federals in his horse as a farmer, to the horror of his aides, but his presence was disregarded, as the Federals had no interest in a seemingly harmless farmer. Concerned that Pope might be withdrawing his army behind Bull Run to link up with McClellan's arriving forces, Jackson determined to attack. Returning to his position behind the tree line, he told his subordinates, \"Bring out your men, gentlemen.\" At about 6:30\u00a0p.m., Confederate artillery began shelling the portion of the column to their front, John Gibbon's Black Hat Brigade (later to be named the Iron Brigade). Gibbon, a former artilleryman, responded with fire from Battery B, 4th U.S. Artillery. The artillery exchange halted King's column. Hatch's brigade had proceeded past the area and Patrick's men, in the rear of the column, sought cover, leaving Gibbon and Doubleday to respond to Jackson's attack. Gibbon assumed that, since Jackson was supposedly at Centreville (according to Pope), and having just seen the 14th Brooklyn of Hatch's Brigade reconnoiter the position, that these were merely horse artillery cannons from Jeb Stuart's cavalry. Gibbon sent aides out to the other brigades with requests for reinforcements, and sent his staff officer Frank A. Haskell to bring the veteran 2nd Wisconsin Infantry up the hill to disperse the harassing cannons. Gibbon met the 2nd in the woods saying, \"If we can get you up there quietly, we can capture those guns.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOur men on the left loaded and fired with the energy of madmen, and the 6th worked with equal desperation. This stopped the rush of the enemy and they halted and fired upon us their deadly musketry. During a few awful moments, I could see by the lurid light of the powder flashes, the whole of both lines. The two ... were within ... fifty yards of each other pouring musketry into each other as fast as men could load and shoot.\n Maj. Rufus R. Dawes, 6th Wisconsin\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn a few moments our entire line was engaged in a fierce and sanguinary struggle with the enemy. As one line was repulsed another took its place and pressed forward as if determined by force of numbers and fury of assault to drive us from our positions.\n Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson\nThe 2nd Wisconsin, under the command of Col. Edgar O'Connor, advanced obliquely back through the woods the Federal column was passing through. When the 430 men emerged from the woods on John Brawner's farm they were quietly formed and advanced up the hill. Upon reaching the plateau, they deployed skirmishers who drove back Confederate skirmishers. They soon received a heavy volley into their right flank by 800 men of the fabled Stonewall Brigade, commanded by Col. William S. Baylor. Absorbing the volley from , the 2nd Wisconsin did not waver, but replied with a devastating volley at the Virginians in Brawner's orchard. The Confederates returned fire when the lines were only apart. As units were added by both sides, the battle lines remained close together, a standup fight with little cover, trading mass volleys for over two hours. Jackson described the action as \"fierce and sanguinary\". Gibbon added his 19th Indiana. Jackson, personally directing the actions of his regiments instead of passing orders to the division commander, Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, sent in three Georgia regiments belonging to Brig. Gen. Alexander R. Lawton's brigade. Gibbon countered this advance with the 7th Wisconsin. Jackson ordered Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble's brigade to support Lawton, which met the last of Gibbon's regiments, the 6th Wisconsin.\nAfter Trimble's brigade entered the action, Gibbon needed to fill a gap in his line between the 6th Wisconsin and the rest of the Iron Brigade regiments. Doubleday sent in the 56th Pennsylvania and the 76th New York, who advanced through the woods and checked the new Confederate advance. These men arrived at the scene after dark and both Trimble and Lawton launched uncoordinated assaults against them. Horse artillery under Captain John Pelham was ordered forward by Jackson and fired at the 19th Indiana from less than . The engagement ended around 9 p.m., with Gibbon's men slowly retreating backwards still firing, making their line at the edge of the woods. Doubleday's regiments retired to the turnpike in an orderly fashion. The fight was essentially a stalemate, but at a heavy cost, with over 1,150 Union and 1,250 Confederate casualties. The 2nd Wisconsin lost 276 of 430 engaged. The Stonewall Brigade lost 340 out of 800. Two Georgia regiments\u2014Trimble's 21st and Lawton's 26th\u2014each lost more than 70%. In all, one of every three men engaged in the fight was shot. Confederate Brig. Gen. William B. Taliaferro wrote, \"In this fight there was no maneuvering and very little tactics. It was a question of endurance and both endured.\" Taliaferro was wounded, as was Ewell, whose left leg was shattered by a Mini\u00e9 ball and had to be amputated, removing him from action for the next ten months.\nJackson had not been able to achieve a decisive victory with his superior force (about 6,200 men against Gibbon's 2,100), due to darkness, his piecemeal deployment of forces, the loss of two of his division commanders, and the tenacity of the enemy. But he had achieved his strategic intent, attracting the attention of John Pope. Pope wrongly assumed that the fight at the Brawner Farm occurred as Jackson was retreating from Centreville. Pope believed he had \"bagged\" Jackson and sought to capture him before he could be reinforced by Longstreet. Pope's dispatch sent that evening to Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny stated, in part, \"General McDowell has intercepted the retreat of the enemy and is now in his front ... Unless he can escape by by-paths leading to the north to-night, he must be captured.\" Gibbon conferred with King, Patrick, and Doubleday as to the next move, because McDowell was \"lost in the woods\". The division was in an exposed position with two of its brigades badly cut up, and facing Stonewall Jackson's entire corps. Although the Union generals did not know exactly how many men Jackson had with him, it was almost certainly a far greater number than the 4000 men in King's division. Moreover, Confederate prisoners taken in the fighting around Brawner's Farm claimed that Jackson's command numbered between 60,000 and 70,000 men and was poised to strike at first light the next morning. Reynolds and Sigel were some miles away and would not be on the scene until morning, by which time Jackson could easily crush King. Ricketts was closer, but had Longstreet following far behind. Since staying in place at Groveton was clearly unacceptable, the only other options were retreating either to Manassas Junction or Centreville. Gibbon recommended the former since the exact disposition of the enemy was unknown and going to Centreville risked a disastrous march across his front. King finally agreed, and the division formed up into columns and moved south to Manassas Junction. At the same time, Ricketts had arrived at a similar conclusion and marched south and away from Jackson as well, in his case towards Bristoe Station.\nPope issued orders to his subordinates to surround Jackson and attack him in the morning, but Jackson was not where Pope thought he was, nor were Pope's own troops where he assumed. He believed that McDowell and Sigel were blocking Jackson's retreat west across the Bull Run Mountains when in fact King and Ricketts had both retreated southward, while Sigel and Reynolds were south and east of Jackson, who had no intention at all of retreating and was well dug-in and awaiting Longstreet's arrival, which Pope refused to believe was a possibility.\nAugust 29: Jackson defends Stony Ridge.\nJackson had initiated the battle at Brawner's farm with the intent of holding Pope until Longstreet arrived with the remainder of the Army of Northern Virginia. Longstreet's 25,000 men began their march from Thoroughfare Gap at 6 a.m. on August 29; Jackson sent Stuart to guide the initial elements of Longstreet's column into positions that Jackson had preselected. While he waited for their arrival, Jackson reorganized his defense in case Pope attacked him that morning, positioning 20,000 men in a line to the south of Stony Ridge. Noticing the buildup of I Corps (Sigel's) troops along the Manassas-Sudley Road, he ordered A.P. Hill's brigades behind the railroad grade near Sudley Church on his left flank. Aware that his position was geographically weak (because the heavy woods in the area prevented effective deployment of artillery), Hill placed his brigades in two lines, with Brig. Gen. Maxcy Gregg's South Carolina brigade and Brig. Gen. Edward L. Thomas's Georgia brigade in the front. In the center of the line, Jackson placed two brigades from Ewell's division (now under the command of Brig. Gen. Alexander Lawton), and on the right, William B. Taliaferro's division, now commanded by Brig. Gen. William E. Starke. Jackson's position straddled a railroad grade that had been dug out by the Manassas Gap Railroad Company in the 1850s and abandoned on the eve of the war. While some parts of the railroad grade were a good defensive position, others were not, moreover the heavily wooded terrain largely precluded the use of artillery aside from the right end of the line, which faced open fields. Fitz Lee's cavalry along with a battery of horse artillery were anchoring the left flank of the Confederate line, in case any Union troops attempted to cross Sudley Ford (as McDowell had done during the battle here 13 months earlier) and get in Jackson's rear. The Confederate right flank was potentially vulnerable, as it was held by Taliaferro's (now Starke's) division, the smallest of Jackson's three divisions and which had also taken significant casualties in the fighting at Brawner's Farm. Jackson thus placed the brigades of Early and Forno on the right end of the line, both large brigades that had not been engaged the previous evening and were fresh. Aside from bolstering Starke's understrength division, they were to watch and give notice of Longstreet's arrival.\nAt daybreak on the 29th, Pope had learned to his surprise and annoyance that Ricketts and King had both withdrawn south. In addition, John Gibbon arrived at Centreville and informed Pope that the retreat from Groveton was a mistake, ignoring the fact that he had recommended it in the first place. Gibbon also stated that he had no idea what had become of McDowell, to which an infuriated Pope replied \"God damn McDowell! He's never where he's supposed to be!\" Gibbon rode down to Manassas where he encountered Porter's troops resting and drawing rations. In addition, King, exhausted and ill from epileptic attacks, had turned over command of the division to John Hatch. McDowell was there as well, after spending most of the previous day wandering aimlessly around Prince William County, and not happy to learn of Pope's orders. In effect, King would accompany Porter, while Reynolds was temporarily attached to Sigel's corps, and Ricketts was still some miles away at Bristoe Station in effect leaving McDowell without any command. Pope on the 29th remained firmly wedded to the idea that Jackson was in a desperate situation and almost trapped, not only an incorrect assumption, but one that also depended on the coordination of all the corps and divisions under his command, none of which were where he intended them to be.\nThe result was that Pope's complicated attack plans for August 29 ended up as a simple frontal assault by Sigel's corps, the only troops in position that morning. I Corps was widely considered one of the army's weakest links, being largely composed of recent German immigrants who spoke little English: Sigel, though a trained and experienced military officer, was German-born and widely considered a political general promoted by Lincoln solely for his ability to recruit and motivate these German-speaking Unionists (many of whom had enlisted solely to fight under him). Having performed poorly in battles against Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley during the spring (and with scant respect or faith from their comrades-in-arms), I Corps' fighting morale was chronically low. Moreover, until Pope himself arrived, Sigel was the ranking officer on the field and would be in overall charge of the battle.\nPope's intention was to move against Jackson on both flanks. He ordered Fitz John Porter to move toward Gainesville and attack what he considered to be the Confederate right flank. He ordered Sigel to attack Jackson's left at daybreak. Sigel, unsure of Jackson's dispositions, chose to advance along a broad front, with Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck's division, supported by Brig. Gen. John F. Reynolds's division (McDowell's III Corps) on the left, Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy's independent brigade in the center, and Brig. Gen. Carl Schurz's division on the right. Schurz's two brigades, moving north on the Manassas-Sudley Road, were the first to contact Jackson's men, at about 7 a.m.\nThe actions in Sigel's attack against A.P. Hill's division were typical of all the attacks near Stony Ridge that day. Although the unfinished railroad provided natural defensive positions in some places, in general the Confederates maintained all but a static defense, absorbing the Union blows and following up with vigorous counterattacks. (These were the same tactics that Jackson would employ at the Battle of Antietam a few weeks later.) Schurz's two brigades (under Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig and Col. W\u0142odzimierz Krzy\u017canowski) skirmished heavily with Gregg and Thomas, with both sides committing their forces piecemeal. Hand-to-hand combat ensued in the woods to the west of Sudley Road as Krzyzanowski's brigade clashed with Gregg's. As Milroy heard the sound of battle to his right, he ordered his brigade forward, the 82nd Ohio and 5th West Virginia in front and the 2nd West Virginia and 4th West Virginia in the rear as support troops. The two forward regiments were immediately met with volleys of Confederate musket fire, in the confusion, the 82nd Ohio found an undefended ravine in the middle of the railroad embankment known as \"The Dump\" and got in the rear of Isaac Trimble's Confederate brigade. However, Trimble was quickly reinforced by part of Bradley Johnson's Virginia brigade and the 82nd Ohio was forced to retreat. Its commander, Col. James Cantwell, was shot dead and the regiment fled in panic, causing the 5th West Virginia behind them to also retreat in disorder. In just 20 minutes of fighting, Milroy's brigade had taken 300 casualties. Schenck and Reynolds, subjected to a heavy artillery barrage, answered with counterbattery fire, but avoided a general advance of their infantry, instead merely deploying skirmishers which got into a low-level firefight with Jubal Early's brigade. While this was going on, Meade's brigade came across wounded men from King's division, who had been abandoned by their comrades and left on the field all night. Medical personnel attempted to evacuate as many of the wounded as possible under the ongoing firefight. With his brigade in shreds, Milroy attempted to rally the survivors. He then came across Brig. Gen Julius Stahel, one of Schenck's brigadiers, and ordered him to defend against any Confederate counterattack coming from the woods. Although a hundred or so Confederates came bounding out of the woods in pursuit of Milroy, they were quickly driven back by artillery fire and Stahel returned to his original position south of the turnpike.\nAssuming that Kearny's division of the III Corps was poised to support him, Schurz ordered another assault against Hill around 10 a.m., now that Schimmelfennig's brigade, plus the 1st New York from Kearny's division, had come up to reinforce Krzyzanowski. The fighting in the woods west of Sudley Road resumed and it came down to a standstill until the 14th Georgia came down to reinforce the South Carolinans. They let loose multiple volleys of musket fire that sent Krzyzanowski's men running in panic. The Confederates came charging after the disorganized mass of Union troops, clubbing, bayoneting, and knifing resisters, but as they exited the woods and came out onto open ground, Union artillery positioned on Dogan's Ridge opened fire on them and forced them to retreat. To the north, Schimmelfennig's three regiments, the 61st Ohio, 74th Pennsylvania, and 8th West Virginia, engaged part of Gregg and Branch's brigades, but were forced to retreat. Kearny however did not move forward. His three brigades instead marched to the banks of Bull Run Creek, where Orlando Poe's brigade forded the creek. The arrival of Poe's brigade aroused panic at Jackson's headquarters, as the dreaded scenario of Union troops getting in the Confederate rear seemed to be turning to reality. Jackson ordered his wagons evacuated from the area and Maj. John Pelham's horse artillery wheeled into position. The horse artillery and several companies of the 1st Virginia Cavalry engaged in a firefight with Poe's brigade for several minutes. Nobody on the Union side realized that they were getting in the rear of the Confederate line, and the sight of gray infantry in the distance was enough to discourage Poe from advancing any further, so he pulled back across the creek. Robinson's brigade remained in position along the banks of the creek while Birney's seven regiments scattered. One was directed to support the corps artillery on Matthews Hill, another held idly in reserve, and the remaining three accompanied Poe to the banks of the creek until Confederate artillery fire became too hot for them and they pulled south into the woods where they joined in skirmishing with A.P. Hill's troops.\nSigel for his part was satisfied with the progress of the battle so far, assuming he was merely supposed to perform a holding action until Pope arrived. By 1 p.m., his sector was reinforced by the division of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker (III Corps) and the brigade of Brig. Gen. Isaac Stevens (IX Corps). Pope also arrived on the battlefield, where Sigel graciously ceded command to him. He expected to see the culmination of his victory, but instead, he found that Sigel's attack had failed completely with Schurz and Milroy's troops shot up, disorganized, and incapable of further action. Reynolds and Schenck's divisions were fresh, but they were committed to guarding the army's left flank. However, Heintzelman's corps and the two divisions of Reno were also available, giving a total of eight fresh brigades, but Pope also assumed that McDowell would be on the field and that McClellan would come down from Washington, D.C., with the II and VI Corps. Instead, there was no sign of any of these troops anywhere. Pope momentarily considered withdrawing to Centreville, but became worried of the political fallout that would result if he was seen as insufficiently aggressive. Around this time, a messenger arrived and delivered Pope a note announcing that McDowell's corps was close up and would soon be on the field. Pope thus decided that he would drive at Jackson's center. By this time, Longstreet's initial units were in position to Jackson's right. Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood's division straddled the turnpike, loosely connected with Jackson's right flank. To Hood's right were the divisions of Brig. Gens. James L. Kemper and David R. \"Neighbor\" Jones. Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox's division arrived last and was placed into reserve.\nStuart's cavalry encountered Porter, Hatch, and McDowell moving up the Manassas-Gainesville Road and a brief but sharp firefight halted the Union column. Then a courier arrived with a message for Porter and McDowell, a controversial document from Pope that has become known as the \"Joint Order\". Historian John J. Hennessy described the order as a \"masterpiece of contradiction and obfuscation that would become the focal point of decades of wrangling\". It described the attacks on Jackson's left, which were already underway, but was unclear about what Porter and McDowell were supposed to do. Rather than moving \"to\" Gainesville and striking Jackson's supposedly unprotected right flank, it described a move \"toward\" Gainesville and \"as soon as communication is established [with the other divisions] the whole command shall halt. It may be necessary to fall back behind Bull Run to Centreville tonight.\" Nowhere in the order did Pope explicitly direct Porter and McDowell to attack and he concluded the order with, \"If any considerable advantages are to be gained from departing from this order it will not be strictly carried out,\" rendering the document virtually useless as a military order.\nMeanwhile, Stuart's cavalry under Col. Thomas Rosser deceived the Union generals by dragging tree branches behind a regiment of horses to simulate great clouds of dust from large columns of marching soldiers. At this time, McDowell received a report from his cavalry commander, Brig. Gen. John Buford, who reported that 17 regiments of infantry, one battery, and 500 cavalry were moving through Gainesville at 8:15\u00a0a.m. This was Longstreet's wing arriving from Thoroughfare Gap, and it warned the two Union generals that trouble lay to their front. The Union advance was again halted. For some reason, McDowell neglected to forward Buford's report to Pope until about 7 p.m., so the army commander was operating under two severe misconceptions: that Longstreet was not near the battlefield and that Porter and McDowell were marching to attack Jackson's right flank.\nAs Longstreet's men were placed into their final positions, General Lee ordered an offensive against the Union left. (Longstreet later remembered that Lee \"was inclined to engage as soon as practicable, but did not order\".) Longstreet, however, saw that the divisions of Reynolds and Schenck extended south of the Warrenton Turnpike, overlapping half of his line, and he argued against making the attack at that time. Lee eventually relented when Jeb Stuart reported that the force on the Gainesville\u2013Manassas Road (Porter and McDowell) was formidable.\nPope, assuming that the attack on Jackson's right would proceed as he thought he had ordered, authorized four separate attacks against Jackson's front with the intent of diverging the Confederates' attention until Porter delivered the fatal blow. Brig. Gen. Cuvier Grover's brigade attacked at 3 p.m., expecting to be supported by Kearny's division. With Isaac Stevens's division behind him as support, Grover moved his brigade into the woods and charged right at Edward Thomas's Georgia brigade. Grover's men got all the way to the railroad embankment and unleashed a volley of near point-blank fire on Thomas's regiments, followed by a bayonet charge. Taken by surprise, the Georgians fell back and fierce hand-to-hand combat ensued. Maxcy Gregg's South Carolinans came to reinforce them, followed by Dorsey Pender's brigade of North Carolinans. Pender hit Grover's brigade in the flank and sent the men fleeing in panic with over 350 casualties. Pender's brigade then surged out of the woods in pursuit of Grover, but once again the Union artillery on Dogan Ridge was too powerful; a strong barrage forced Pender to retreat. Meanwhile, to the north, Joseph Carr's brigade had been engaged in a low-level firefight with Confederate troops, in the process wounding Isaac Trimble, one of Jackson's most dependable brigadiers since the Valley campaign the previous spring. With Nelson Taylor's brigade of Hooker's division in support, James Nagle's brigade of Reno's division surged forward and slammed into Trimble's brigade, temporarily leaderless. Trimble's men were routed and began to retreat in disorder, but like all the previous Union attacks during the day, Nagle was unsupported and had no chance against overwhelming enemy numbers. Henry Forno's Louisiana brigade counterattacked and drove Nagle back. Bradley Johnson and Col. Leroy Stafford's 9th Louisiana joined in the assault. To the south, John Hood's division had just arrived on the field, forcing back Milroy and Nagle. Milroy's already exhausted brigade fell apart and started to run from the onslaught. To check the Confederate counterattack, Pope pulled Schenck from south of the turnpike and with artillery support, forced the Confederates back to the shelter of the railroad embankment. While all this was going on, Kearny still remained out of the action.\nReynolds was ordered to conduct a spoiling attack south of the turnpike and encountered Longstreet's men, causing him to call off his demonstration. Pope dismissed Reynolds's concern as a case of mistaken identity, insisting that Reynolds had run into Porter's V Corps, preparing to attack Jackson's flank. Jesse Reno ordered a IX Corps brigade under Col. James Nagle to attack the center of Jackson's line again. This time Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble's brigade was driven back from the railroad embankment, but Confederate counterattacks restored the line and pursued Nagle's troops back into the open fields until Union artillery halted their advance.\nAt 4:30\u00a0p.m., Pope finally sent an explicit order to Porter to attack, but his aide (his nephew) lost his way and did not deliver the message until 6:30\u00a0p.m. In any event, Porter was in no better position to attack then than he had been earlier in the day. However, in anticipation of the attack that would not come, Pope ordered Kearny to attack Jackson's far left flank, intending to put strong pressure on both ends of the line. At 5 p.m. Kearny sent Robinson and Birney's brigades surging forward into A.P. Hill's exhausted division. The brunt of the attack fell on Maxcy Gregg's brigade, which had defended against two major assaults over eight hours that day and was nearly out of ammunition in addition to having lost most of its officers. As they fell back onto the edge of a hillside, Gregg lopped some wildflowers with his old Revolutionary War scimitar and remarked, \"Let us die here my men, let us die here.\" With both Thomas's and Gregg's brigades on the verge of disintegrating, A.P. Hill sent a message to Jackson calling for help. Meanwhile, Daniel Leasure's brigade of Isaac Stevens's division crept around to the south and forced back James Archer's Tennessee brigade. Jubal Early's brigade, which had begun the day on the extreme right of the Confederate line, and Lawrence O'Bryan Branch's brigade, which had thus far been held in reserve, counterattacked and drove back Kearny's division. During the fighting, one of Hill's brigadiers, Charles W. Field, was severely wounded and command of his brigade, which had also taken a beating over the course of the day, fell to Col. John M. Brockenbrough of the 40th Virginia.\nOn the Confederate right, Longstreet observed a movement of McDowell's force away from his front; the I Corps was moving divisions to Henry House Hill to support Reynolds. This report caused Lee to revive his plan for an offensive in that sector. Longstreet once again argued against it, this time due to inadequate time before dusk. Longstreet suggested \"that the day being far spent it might be well to advance before night on a forced reconnaissance, get our troops in the most favourable positions, and have all things ready for battle the next morning.\" To this General Lee reluctantly gave consent and Hood's division was sent forward. As soon as McDowell arrived at Pope's headquarters, the latter urged him to move King's division forward. McDowell then informed Pope that King had fallen ill and relinquished command of the division to Brig. Gen John P. Hatch, whom Pope had taken a considerable disliking to early in the campaign. Hatch had originally led a cavalry brigade and failed to carry out an order from Pope to raid down into the Richmond outskirts. Displeased at this, Pope reassigned Hatch to infantry command. He now ordered Hatch to go up the Sudley Road and attack, but Hatch protested that the road was clogged with Kearny's troops, it would not be possible to clear them out of the way before darkness. Exasperated, Pope repeated his order for Hatch to advance on the Confederate right, but was soon distracted by actions going on the other side of the line. John Hood's division had arrived on Jackson's right and McDowell ordered Hatch to reinforce Reynolds despite Hatch's protests that two of his three brigades (Gibbon and Doubleday's) were exhausted from the fight at Brawner's Farm the previous day. Hatch deployed Doubleday's brigade out in front. Hood's division forced Hatch and Reynolds back to a position on Bald Hill, overrunning Chinn Ridge in the process. As night fell, Hood pulled back from this exposed position. Longstreet and his subordinates again argued to Lee that they should not be attacking a force they considered to be placed in a strong defensive position, and for the third time, Lee cancelled the planned assault.\nHood's withdrawal from Chinn Ridge only reinforced Pope's belief that the enemy was retreating. When Pope learned from McDowell about Buford's report, he finally acknowledged that Longstreet was on the field, but he optimistically assumed that Longstreet was there only to reinforce Jackson while the entire Confederate army withdrew; Hood's division had in fact just done that. Pope issued explicit orders for Porter's corps to rejoin the main body of the army and planned for another offensive on August 30. Historian A. Wilson Greene argues that this was Pope's worst decision of the battle. Since he no longer had numerical superiority over the Confederates and did not possess any geographical advantage, the most prudent course would have been to withdraw his army over Bull Run and unite with McClellan's Army of the Potomac, which had 25,000 men nearby.\nView of the battlefield on August 29\u201330\nThat evening, Pope wired Halleck with a report of the day's fighting, describing it as \"severe\" and estimating his losses at 7000\u20138000 men. He estimated Confederate losses at twice this many, an extremely incorrect estimation given that Jackson had been fighting a mostly defensive battle. Although Confederate casualties were lower, their officer losses had been high; aside from the loss of two division commanders on August 28, three brigade commanders, Trimble, Field, and Col. Henry Forno, had been wounded. For comparison, only one Union brigade commander had been wounded so far, Col. Daniel Leasure, and no general officers.\nOne of the historical controversies of the battle involves George B. McClellan's cooperation with John Pope. In late August, two full corps of the Army of the Potomac (William B. Franklin's VI Corps and Edwin V. Sumner's II Corps) had arrived in Alexandria, but McClellan would not allow them to advance to Manassas because of what he considered inadequate artillery, cavalry, and transportation support. He was accused by his political opponents of deliberately undermining Pope's position, and he did not help his case in history when he wrote to his wife on August 10, \"Pope will be badly thrashed within two days &amp; ... they will be very glad to turn over the redemption of their affairs to me. I won't undertake it unless I have full &amp; entire control.\" He told Abraham Lincoln on August 29 that it might be wise \"to leave Pope to get out of his scrape, and at once use all our means to make the capital perfectly safe\".\nAugust 30: Longstreet counterattack, Union retreat.\nThe final element of Longstreet's command, the division of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson, marched and arrived on the battlefield at 3 a.m., August 30. Exhausted and unfamiliar with the area, they halted on a ridge east of Groveton. At dawn, they realized they were in an isolated position too close to the enemy and fell back. Pope's belief that the Confederate army was in retreat was reinforced by this movement, which came after the withdrawal of Hood's troops the night before.\nPope thus directed McDowell to move his entire corps up the Sudley Road and hit the Confederate right flank. McDowell however protested this order, stating that he had no idea what was happening down on the Confederate left and he would much prefer to have his troops on Chinn Ridge. He then said that it would make more sense to attack the Confederate right with Heintzelman's troops, since they were closer to this area. Pope gave in, but decided to detach King's division to support Heintzelman.\nAt an 8 a.m. council of war at Pope's headquarters, his subordinates attempted to convince their commander to move cautiously. Probes of the Confederate line on Stony Ridge around 10 a.m. indicated that Stonewall Jackson's men were still firmly in their defensive positions. John F. Reynolds indicated that the Confederates were in great strength south of the turnpike. Fitz John Porter arrived later with similar intelligence. However, Heintzelman and McDowell conducted a personal reconnaissance that somehow failed to find Jackson's defensive line, and Pope finally made up his mind to attack the retreating Southerners.\nWhile Porter was bringing his corps up, a further mix-up in orders resulted in the loss of two brigades. Abram Sanders Piatt's small brigade, which had been detached from the defenses of Washington, D.C., and temporarily attached to the V Corps, and Charles Griffin's brigade both pulled out of Porter's main column, marched back down to Manassas Junction, and then up to Centreville. Morell, using an outdated set of orders from a day earlier, had assumed Pope was at Centreville and he was expected to join him there. Piatt eventually realized that something was amiss and turned back around towards the battlefield, arriving on Henry House Hill at about 4 p.m. Griffin and his division commander Maj. Gen George W. Morell, however, stayed at Centreville despite their discovery that Pope was not there. Eventually, at 4 p.m., Griffin began moving his brigade towards the action, but by this point, Pope's army was in full retreat and a mass of wagons and stragglers were blocking the roadway. Additionally, the bridge over Cub Run was broken, making it impossible for him to move any further west.\nAs Ricketts's division approached the Confederate lines, it became clear that the enemy was still there in force and was showing no sign of retreating. Pope, unnerved by these reports, contemplated waiting for McClellan to arrive with the II and VI Corps, but then worried that McClellan would take credit for any victory in the battle, so he decided to attack immediately rather than wait. Shortly after noon, Pope issued orders for Porter's corps, supported by Hatch and Reynolds, to advance west along the turnpike. At the same time, Ricketts, Kearny, and Hooker were to advance on the Confederate left. This dual movement would potentially crush the retreating Confederates. But the Confederates were not retreating, and were in fact hoping to be attacked. Lee was still waiting for an opportunity to counterattack with Longstreet's force. Although he was not certain that Pope would attack that day, Lee positioned 18 artillery pieces under Col. Stephen D. Lee on high ground northeast of the Brawner Farm, ideally situated to bombard the open fields in front of Jackson's position.\nPorter's corps was actually not in position to pursue west on the turnpike, but was in the woods north of the turnpike near Groveton. It took about two hours to prepare the assault on Jackson's line, ten brigades numbering roughly 10,000 men, with 28 artillery pieces on Dogan Ridge to support them. On the right, Ricketts' division would support Heintzelman while Sigel's corps remained in reserve to the rear. Reynolds' division was stationed near Henry House Hill, with King's division on its right. Porter would strike Jackson's right flank with his 1st Division. Since General Morell was not present, command of the remaining troops fell to Brig. Gen Daniel Butterfield, the ranking brigadier in the division. George Sykes' division of regular army troops was held in reserve. As noon approached and the sun climbed high up in the sky, temperatures on the battlefield topped 90\u00a0\u00b0F.\nThe Confederates, however, attempted to strike the first blow. Elements of Hill's and Ewell's divisions came charging out of the woods and surprised some of Ricketts' men with a volley or two, but once again the Union artillery on Dogan Ridge was too much for them and after being blasted by shellfire, they withdrew back to the line of the unfinished railroad.\nThe Union men faced a formidable task. Butterfield's division had to cross of open pasture, land owned by widow Lucinda Dogan, the final of which were steeply uphill, to attack a strong position behind the unfinished railroad. Porter then ordered John Hatch's division to support Butterfield's right flank. Hatch formed his four brigades into a line of battle, the attack being spearheaded by his own brigade, now commanded by Col. Timothy Sullivan since he assumed division command the day earlier. Hatch's division had only to traverse, but was required to perform a complex right wheel maneuver under fire to hit the Confederate position squarely in its front. They experienced devastating fire from Stephen Lee's batteries and then withering volleys from the infantrymen in the line. In the confusion, Hatch was knocked from his horse by an artillery shell and taken off the field unconscious. Nevertheless, they were able to break the Confederate line, routing the 48th Virginia Infantry. The Stonewall Brigade rushed in to restore the line, taking heavy casualties, including its commander, Col. Baylor. In what was arguably the most famous incident of the battle, Confederates in Col. Bradley T. Johnson's and Col. Leroy A. Stafford's brigades fired so much that they ran out of ammunition and resorted to throwing large rocks at the 24th New York, causing occasional damage, and prompting some of the surprised New Yorkers to throw them back. To support Jackson's exhausted defense, which was stretched to the breaking point, Longstreet's artillery added to the barrage against Union reinforcements attempting to move in, cutting them to pieces. Hatch's brigade fell back in confusion, the men running into Patrick's brigade and causing them to also panic. The mob quickly contacted Gibbon's brigade, which remained some distance to the rear, while Doubleday's brigade had inexplicably wandered away from the field of action. Meanwhile, Butterfield's hard-pressed division was buckling under heavy Confederate musketry and artillery blasts and coming near to disintegrating.\nTrying to shore up Butterfield's faltering attack, Porter ordered Lt. Col Robert C. Buchanan's brigade of regulars into action, but Longstreet's attack on the Union left interrupted him. The withdrawal was also a costly operation. Some of the jubilant Confederates in Starke's brigade attempted a pursuit, but were beaten back by the Union reserves posted along the Groveton-Sudley Road. Overall, Jackson's command was too depleted to counterattack, allowing Porter to stabilize the situation north of the turnpike. Concerned about Porter's situation, however, Irvin McDowell ordered Reynolds's division to leave Chinn Ridge and come to Porter's support. This may have been the worst tactical decision of the day because it left only 2,200 Union troops south of the turnpike, where they would soon face ten times their number of Confederates.\nLee and Longstreet agreed that the time was right for the long-awaited assault and that the objective would be Henry House Hill, which had been the key terrain in the First Battle of Bull Run, and which, if captured, would dominate the potential Union line of retreat. Longstreet's command of 25,000 men in five divisions stretched nearly a mile and a half from the Brawner Farm in the north to the Manassas Gap Railroad in the south. To reach the hill, they would have to traverse 1.5 to of ground containing ridges, streams, and some heavily wooded areas. Longstreet knew that he would not be able to project a well-coordinated battle line across this terrain, so he had to rely on the drive and initiative of his division commanders. The lead division, on the left, closest to the turnpike, was John Bell Hood's Texans, supported by Brig. Gen. Nathan G. \"Shanks\" Evans's South Carolinians. On Hood's right were Kemper's and Jones's divisions. Anderson's division was held in reserve. Just before the attack, Lee signaled to Jackson: \"General Longstreet is advancing; look out for and protect his left flank.\"\nRealizing what was happening down on the left, Porter told Buchanan to instead move in that direction to stem the Confederate onslaught and then also sent a messenger to find the other regular brigade, commanded by Col. Charles W. Roberts and get it into action. The Union defenders south of the turnpike consisted of only two brigades, commanded by Cols. Nathaniel C. McLean (Schenck's division, Sigel's I Corps) and Gouverneur K. Warren (Sykes's division, Porter's V Corps). McLean held Chinn Ridge, Warren was near Groveton, about further west. Hood's men began the assault at 4 p.m., immediately overwhelming Warren's two regiments, the 5th New York (Dury\u00e9e's Zouaves) and 10th New York (the National Zouaves). Within the first 10 minutes of contact, the 500 men of the 5th New York had suffered almost 300 casualties, 120 of them mortally wounded. This was the largest loss of life of any infantry regiment in a single battle during the entire war. The Zouave regiments had been wearing bright red and blue uniforms, and one of Hood's officers wrote that the bodies lying on the hill reminded him of the Texas countryside when the wildflowers were in bloom.\nWhile all this was going on, Pope was at his headquarters behind Dogan Ridge, oblivious to the chaos unfurling to the south. Instead, he was focused on a message he had just received from Henry Halleck announcing that the II and VI Corps, plus Brig. Gen Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, were on the way to reinforce him, and moreover, McClellan had been ordered to stay behind in Washington, D.C. This would give Pope 41 brigades, all of them completely under his command and with no interference from McClellan whatsoever. Only after Warren had collapsed and McLean was being driven from the field did Pope finally realize what was happening.\nMcDowell ordered Ricketts' division to disengage from its attack on the Confederate left, which had also failed to achieve any breakthrough, and reinforce the Union left. McDowell rode out with Reynolds to supervise the construction of the new line of defense on Chinn Ridge, just as Porter's shattered troops came running out of the woods to the west. Reynolds protested the order to move to Chinn Ridge, arguing that his division was needed to prevent a Confederate attack from the woods. McDowell, however, told Reynolds that the Confederate attack was not coming from that direction, but from the south and to move his division there immediately. Even before this happened, one of Reynolds' brigade commanders, Col. Martin Hardin (commanding Brig. Gen Conrad F. Jackson's brigade after Jackson had called in sick the previous day), took the initiative by himself and marched down to stem the Confederate onslaught. Taking with him Battery G of the 1st Pennsylvania Artillery, Hardin's brigade unleashed a volley of musket fire that stunned the 1st and 4th Texas regiments, but the 5th Texas to the right kept coming on and quickly shot down most of the gunners of Battery G. Nathan Evans' South Carolina brigade now arrived to reinforce the Texans and got in the rear of Hardin's brigade. Hardin fell wounded and command of the brigade devolved on Col. James Kirk of the 10th Pennsylvania Reserves. Kirk was shot down within minutes and a lieutenant colonel took over. The crumbling remains of the brigade fell back, some soldiers pausing to take shots at the oncoming Confederates. Nathaniel McLean's brigade of Ohioans arrived on the scene, but was assailed on three sides by the brigades of Law, Wilcox, and Evans, and soon joined the survivors of Hardin's brigade in a disorganized mob on Henry House Hill.\nThe first two Union brigades to arrive were from Ricketts's division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Zealous B. Tower and Col. Fletcher Webster, temporarily commanding Col. John Stiles' brigade. James Ricketts had been at the same battlefield a year earlier, at First Bull Run, where he had commanded a regular gun battery and had been captured at the fight for Henry Hill. Tower's brigade slammed Wilcox's Alabamians in the flank and sent them reeling, but was then immediately confronted with the fresh Confederate division of David R. Jones. Webster lined up his four regiments to face the Confederate attackers, but was struck by an artillery shell and collapsed dead on the field. Disheartened by Webster's death, his men began to fall back. Meanwhile, Tower was shot from his horse and carried off the field unconscious. Robert Schenck then ordered Col. John Koltes' brigade, which had been held in reserve during Sigel's attack on the Confederate left the previous day and was fresh, into action, along with Wlodzimierz Krzyzanowski's brigade, which had been heavily engaged and was tired. Koltes however was quickly struck by an artillery shell and killed. Overall command devolved onto Col. Richard Coulter of the 11th Pennsylvania, the highest-ranking officer remaining on the field, and a Mexican War veteran. Although Koltes and Krzyzanowski's six regiments held their ground for a little while, they were quickly overwhelmed by yet more fresh Confederates in the brigades of Lewis Armistead, Montgomery Corse, and Eppa Hunton and started to fall back in disorder.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nR.H. Anderson failed to avail himself of the most significant advantage three hours of fighting on Chinn Ridge and Henry Hill had forged. Because he did not, the Confederates' last opportunity to destroy Pope's army dwindled with the day's light.\nJohn J. Hennessy, \"Return to Bull Run\"\nDuring the first two hours of the Confederate assault, McDowell had constructed a new line of defense consisting of Reynolds' and Sykes' divisions. Longstreet's last fresh troops,\nRichard Anderson's division now took the offensive. The regulars of George Sykes's division along with Meade and Seymour's brigades, plus Piatt's brigade, formed a line on Henry House Hill that held off this final Confederate attack long enough to give the rest of the army time to withdraw across Bull Run Creek to Centreville.\nStonewall Jackson, under relatively ambiguous orders from Lee to support Longstreet, launched an attack north of the turnpike at 6 p.m., probably as soon as his exhausted forces could be mustered. Historian John J. Hennessy called Jackson's delays \"one of the battle's great puzzles\" and \"one of the most significant Confederate failures\" of the battle, greatly reducing the value of his advance. The attack coincided with Pope's ordered withdrawal of units north of the turnpike to assist in the Henry House Hill defense and the Confederates were able to overrun a number of artillery and infantry units in their fierce assault. By 7 p.m., however, Pope had established a strong defensive line that aligned with the units on Henry House Hill. At 8 p.m., he ordered a general withdrawal on the turnpike to Centreville. Unlike the calamitous retreat at the First Battle of Bull Run, the Union movement was quiet and orderly. The Confederates, weary from battle and low on ammunition, did not pursue in the darkness. Although Lee had won a great victory, he had not achieved his objective of destroying Pope's army.\nThe final significant action of the battle occurred around 7:00 PM as Lee directed J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry to go around the Union flank and cut off their retreat. Brig. Gen Beverly Robertson's cavalry brigade, accompanied by Col. Thomas Rosser's 5th Virginia Cavalry headed for Lewis Ford, a crossing in Bull Run Creek that would enable them to get in the rear of the Union army. However, Robertson and Rosser found the crossing blocked by John Buford's cavalry and after a short, but fierce engagement, Buford's superior numbers won out and the Confederate horsemen pulled back. The cavalry clash lasted only about ten minutes, but resulted in Col. Thomas Munford of the 2nd Virginia Cavalry being wounded. Col. Thornton Brodhead of the 1st Michigan Cavalry was shot dead, and John Buford was also wounded. The Union army's retreat however had been safeguarded.\nAftermath.\nCasualties.\nThe Second Battle of Manassas, like the First (July 21, 1861), was a significant tactical victory for the Confederates and was another blow to Union morale. Union casualties were about 14,000 killed and wounded out of 62,000 engaged (22.5%); the Confederates lost about 1,000 killed and 7,000 wounded out of 50,000 (16%).\nChantilly.\nAs the Union army concentrated on Centreville, Lee planned his next move. He sent Jackson on another flanking march in an attempt to interpose his army between Pope and Washington. Pope countered the move and the two forces clashed a final time at the Battle of Chantilly (also known as Ox Hill) on September 1. Lee immediately began his next campaign on September 3, when the vanguard of the Army of Northern Virginia crossed the Potomac River, marching toward a fateful encounter with the Army of the Potomac in the Maryland campaign and the Battle of Antietam.\nPope relieved of command.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA splendid army almost demoralized, millions of public property given up or destroyed, thousands of lives of our best men sacrificed for no purpose. I dare not trust myself to speak of this commander [Pope] as I feel and believe. Suffice to say ... that more insolence, superciliousness, ignorance, and pretentiousness were never combined in one man. It can in truth be said of him that he had not a friend in his command from the smallest drummer boy to the highest general officer.\n Brig. Gen. Alpheus S. Williams (II Corps division commander)\nPope was relieved of command on September 12, and his army was merged into the Army of the Potomac as it marched into Maryland under McClellan. He spent the remainder of the war in the Department of the Northwest in Minnesota, dealing with the Dakota War of 1862. Pope sought scapegoats to spread the blame for his defeat. On November 25, Fitz John Porter was arrested and court-martialed for his actions on August 29. Porter was found guilty on January 10, 1863, of disobedience and misconduct, and he was dismissed from the Army on January 21. He spent most of the remainder of his life fighting against the verdict. In 1878, a special commission under General John M. Schofield exonerated Porter by finding that his reluctance to attack Longstreet probably saved Pope's Army of Virginia from an even greater defeat. Eight years later, President Chester A. Arthur reversed Porter's sentence.\nLongstreet criticized.\nJames Longstreet was criticized for his performance during the battle and the postbellum advocates of the Lost Cause claimed that his slowness, reluctance to attack, and disobedience to Gen. Lee on August 29 were a harbinger of his controversial performance to come on July 2, 1863, at the Battle of Gettysburg. Lee's biographer, Douglas Southall Freeman, wrote: \"The seeds of much of the disaster at Gettysburg were sown in that instant\u2014when Lee yielded to Longstreet and Longstreet discovered that he would.\"\nBattlefield preservation.\nPart of the site of the battle is now Manassas National Battlefield Park. Located north of Manassas, in Prince William County, Virginia, it preserves the site of two major American Civil War battles: the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, and the Second Battle of Bull Run which was fought between August 28 and August 30, 1862 (also known as the First Battle of Manassas and the Second Battle of Manassas, respectively). The peaceful Virginia countryside bore witness to clashes between the armies of the North (Union) and the South (Confederacy), and it was there that Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson acquired his nickname \"Stonewall\". The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the Second Battle of Bull Run battlefield in more than 10 transactions since 2000.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It states that a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of formula_1 (the complete graph on five vertices) nor of formula_2 (a complete bipartite graph on six vertices, three of which connect to each of the other three, also known as the utility graph).\nStatement.\nA planar graph is a graph whose vertices can be represented by points in the Euclidean plane, and whose edges can be represented by simple curves in the same plane connecting the points representing their endpoints, such that no two curves intersect except at a common endpoint. Planar graphs are often drawn with straight line segments representing their edges, but by F\u00e1ry's theorem allowing curved edges or requiring straight edges makes no difference to their graph-theoretic characterization.\nA subdivision of a graph is a graph formed by subdividing its edges into paths of one or more edges. Kuratowski's theorem states that a finite graph formula_3 is planar if it is not possible to subdivide the edges of formula_1 or formula_2, and then possibly add additional edges and vertices, to form a graph isomorphic to formula_3. Equivalently, a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to formula_1 or formula_2.\nKuratowski subgraphs.\nIf formula_3 is a graph that contains a subgraph formula_10 that is a subdivision of formula_1 or formula_2, then formula_10 is known as a Kuratowski subgraph of formula_3. With this notation, Kuratowski's theorem can be expressed succinctly: a graph is planar if and only if it does not have a Kuratowski subgraph.\nThe two graphs formula_1 and formula_2 are nonplanar, as may be shown either by a case analysis or an argument involving Euler's formula. Additionally, subdividing a graph cannot turn a nonplanar graph into a planar graph: if a subdivision of a graph formula_3 has a planar drawing, the paths of the subdivision form curves that may be used to represent the edges of formula_3 itself. Therefore, a graph that contains a Kuratowski subgraph cannot be planar. The more difficult direction in proving Kuratowski's theorem is to show that, if a graph is nonplanar, it must contain a Kuratowski subgraph.\nAlgorithmic implications.\nA Kuratowski subgraph of a nonplanar graph can be found in linear time, as measured by the size of the input graph. This allows the correctness of a planarity testing algorithm to be verified for nonplanar inputs, as it is straightforward to test whether a given subgraph is or is not a Kuratowski subgraph.\nUsually, non-planar graphs contain a large number of Kuratowski-subgraphs. The extraction of these subgraphs is needed, e.g., in branch and cut algorithms for crossing minimization. It is possible to extract a large number of Kuratowski subgraphs in time dependent on their total size.\nHistory.\nKazimierz Kuratowski published his theorem in 1930. The theorem was independently proved by Orrin Frink and Paul Smith, also in 1930, but their proof was never published. The special case of cubic planar graphs (for which the only minimal forbidden subgraph is formula_2) was also independently proved by Karl Menger in 1930.\nSince then, several new proofs of the theorem have been discovered.\nIn the Soviet Union, Kuratowski's theorem was known as either the Pontryagin\u2013Kuratowski theorem or the Kuratowski\u2013Pontryagin theorem,\nas the theorem was reportedly proved independently by Lev Pontryagin around 1927.\nHowever, as Pontryagin never published his proof, this usage has not spread to other places.\nRelated results.\nA closely related result, Wagner's theorem, characterizes the planar graphs by their minors in terms of the same two forbidden graphs formula_1 and formula_2. Every Kuratowski subgraph is a special case of a minor of the same type, and while the reverse is not true, it is not difficult to find a Kuratowski subgraph (of one type or the other) from one of these two forbidden minors; therefore, these two theorems are equivalent.\nAn extension is the Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem, stating that every class of graphs closed under taking minors (as the planar graphs are) can be characterized in an analogous way by a finite set of forbidden minors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "54496", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54496", "title": "Lawrence Lessig", "text": "American legal scholar and activist (born 1961)\nLester Lawrence \"Larry\" Lessig III (born June 3, 1961) is an American legal scholar and political activist. He is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and the former director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. He is the founder of Creative Commons and of Equal Citizens. Lessig was a candidate for the Democratic Party's nomination for president of the United States in the 2016 U.S. presidential election but withdrew before the primaries.\nLife and career.\nLessig was born on June 3, 1961, in Rapid City, South Dakota to Lester Lawrence \"Jack\" Lessig II (1929\u20132020) who was an engineer and Patricia \"Pat\" West Lessig (1930\u20132019), a real estate agent. He has two older step-siblings, Robert (died 2019) and Kitty, and a younger biological sister, Leslie. He grew up in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1983 with a double degree B.A. in economics and a B.S. in management. He then studied philosophy at Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving a M.A. in 1986. Lessig then returned to the United States to attend law school. He did his first year at the University of Chicago Law School before transferring to Yale Law School, and graduated in 1989 with a J.D. degree.\nAfter graduation from law school, Lessig was a law clerk for Richard Posner of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 1989 to 1990, and then for Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1990 to 1991.\nLessig started his academic career at the University of Chicago Law School, where he was professor from 1991 to 1997. As co-director of its Center for the Study of Constitutionalism in Eastern Europe, he helped the newly independent Republic of Georgia draft a constitution. From 1997 to 2000, he was at Harvard Law School, holding for a year the chair of Berkman Professor of Law, affiliated with the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society. He subsequently joined Stanford Law School, where he established the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.\nLessig returned to Harvard in July 2009 as professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. In 2013, Lessig was appointed as the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard; his chair lecture was entitled \"Aaron's Laws: Law and Justice in a Digital Age.\"\nViews.\nLessig is a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on copyright, trademark, and radio frequency spectrum, particularly in technology applications. In 2001, he founded Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon and to share legally. Prior to his most recent appointment at Harvard, he was a professor of law at Stanford Law School, where he founded the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, and at the University of Chicago. He is a former board member of the Free Software Foundation and Software Freedom Law Center; the Washington, D.C. lobbying groups Public Knowledge and Free Press; and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2007.\nAs a political activist, Lessig has called for state-based activism to promote substantive reform of government with a Second Constitutional Convention. In May 2014, he launched a crowd-funded political action committee that he entitled Mayday PAC, with the purpose of electing candidates to Congress who would pass campaign finance reform. Lessig is also the co-founder of Rootstrikers, and is on the boards of MapLight and Represent.Us. He serves on the advisory boards of the Democracy Caf\u00e9 and the Sunlight Foundation.\nIn August 2015, Lessig announced that he was exploring a possible candidacy for president of the United States, promising to run if his exploratory committee raised $1 million by Labor Day. After accomplishing this, on September 6, 2015, Lessig announced that he was entering the race to become a candidate for the 2016 Democratic Party presidential nomination. Lessig described his candidacy as a referendum on campaign finance reform and electoral reform legislation. He stated that, if elected, he would serve a full term as president with his proposed reforms as his legislative priorities. He ended his campaign in November 2015, citing rule changes from the Democratic Party that precluded him from appearing in the televised debates.\nPolitical background.\nLessig has emphasized in interviews that his study of philosophy at Cambridge radically changed his values and career path. Previously, he had held strong conservative or libertarian political views, desired a career in business, was a highly active member of Teenage Republicans, served as the 1978 youth governor for Pennsylvania through the YMCA Youth and Government program, and almost pursued a Republican political career.\nSince studying philosophy at Cambridge in the mid-1980s, Lessig has been politically liberal. What was intended to be a year abroad at Cambridge convinced him instead to stay another two years to complete an undergraduate degree in philosophy and develop his changing political values. During this time, he also traveled in the Eastern Bloc, where he acquired a lifelong interest in Eastern European law and politics.\nBy the late 1980s, two influential conservative judges, Judge Richard Posner and Justice Antonin Scalia, selected him to serve as a law clerk, choosing him because they considered him brilliant, rather than for his ideology, and effectively making him the \"token liberal\" on their respective staffs. Later, Posner would call Lessig \"the most distinguished law professor of his generation.\"\nLessig remains skeptical of government intervention, but favors some regulation, calling himself \"a constitutionalist\". On one occasion, Lessig also commended the John McCain campaign for discussing fair use rights in a letter to YouTube where it took issue with YouTube for indulging overreaching copyright claims that led to the removal of various campaign videos.\nInternet and computer activism.\n\"Code is law\".\nIn computer science, \"code\" typically refers to the text of a computer program (the source code). In law, \"code\" may refer to the texts that constitute statutory law. In his 1999 book entitled \"Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace\", Lessig explores the ways in which code can be instruments for social control in both senses, leading to his dictum that \"Code is law\". Lessig later updated his work in order to keep up with the prevailing views of the time and released the book as \"\" in December 2006.\nRemix culture.\nLessig has been a proponent of the remix culture since the early 2000s. In his 2008 book entitled, \"Remix\", he presents this as a desirable cultural practice distinct from piracy. Lessig further articulates remix culture as intrinsic to technology and the Internet. Remix culture is therefore an amalgam of practice, creativity, \"read/write\" culture, and the hybrid economy.\nAccording to Lessig, the problem with the remix comes when it is at odds with stringent U.S. copyright law. He has compared this to the failure of prohibition, both in its ineffectiveness and in its tendency to normalize criminal behavior. Instead he proposes more lenient licensing, namely Creative Commons licenses, as a remedy to maintain \"rule of law\" while combating plagiarism.\nFree culture.\nOn March 28, 2004 Lessig was elected to the FSF board of directors. He proposed the concept of \"free culture\". He also supports free and open-source software and open spectrum. At his free culture keynote speech at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2002, a few minutes of his speech was about software patents, which he views as a rising threat to free software, open source software, and innovation.\nIn March 2006, Lessig joined the board of advisors of the Digital Universe project. A few months later, Lessig gave a talk on the ethics of the Free Culture Movement at the 2006 Wikimania conference. In December 2006, his lecture \"On Free, and the Differences between Culture and Code\" was one of the highlights at 23C3 \"Who can you trust?\".\nAccording to Comedy Central, Lessig claimed in 2009 that because 70 percent of young people obtain digital information from illegal sources, laws should be changed.\nIn a foreword to the Freesouls book project, Lessig makes an argument in favor of amateur artists in the world of digital technologies: \"there is a different class of amateur creators that digital technologies have\u00a0... enabled, and a different kind of creativity has emerged as a consequence\".\nLessig is also a well-known critic of copyright term extensions.\nNet neutrality.\nLessig has long been known to be a supporter of net neutrality. In 2006, he testified before the U.S. Senate that he believed Congress should ratify Michael Powell's four Internet freedoms and add a restriction to access-tiering, i.e., he does not believe content providers should be charged different amounts. The reason is that the Internet, under the neutral end-to-end design is an invaluable platform for innovation, and the economic benefit of innovation would be threatened if large corporations could purchase faster service to the detriment of newer companies with less capital. However, Lessig has supported the idea of allowing ISPs to give consumers the option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, \"Now, no doubt, my position might be wrong. Some friends in the network neutrality movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong\u2014that it doesn't go far enough. But the suggestion that the position is 'recent' is baseless. If I'm wrong, I've always been wrong.\"\nLegislative reform.\nDespite presenting an anti-regulatory standpoint in many fora, Lessig still sees the need for legislative enforcement of copyright. He has called for limiting copyright terms for creative professionals to five years, but believes that since many of them are independent, the work of creative professionals would become more easily and quickly available if a bureaucratic procedure were introduced to renew trademarks for up to 75 years after this five-year term.\nLessig has repeatedly taken a stance that privatization through legislation such as that seen in the 1980s in the UK with British Telecommunications is not the best way to help the Internet grow. He said, \"When government disappears, it's not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place\", \"My claim is that we should focus on the values of liberty. If there is not government to insist on those values, then who?\" \"The single unifying force should be that we govern ourselves.\"\nLegal challenges.\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Lessig represented a high-profile challenge to the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. Working with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Lessig led the team representing the plaintiff in \"Eldred v. Ashcroft\". The plaintiff in the case was joined by a group of publishers who frequently published work in the public domain and a large number of \"amici\" including the Free Software Foundation, the American Association of Law Libraries, the Bureau of National Affairs, and the College Art Association.\nIn March 2003, Lessig acknowledged severe disappointment with his Supreme Court defeat in the Eldred copyright-extension case, where he unsuccessfully tried to convince Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who had sympathies for de-regulation, to back his \"market-based\" approach to intellectual property regulation.\nIn August 2013, Lawrence Lessig brought suit against Liberation Music PTY Ltd., after Liberation issued a takedown notice of one of Lessig's lectures on YouTube that had used the song \"Lisztomania\" by the band Phoenix, whom Liberation Music represents. Lessig sought damages under section 512(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which holds parties liable for misrepresentations of infringement or removal of material. Lessig was represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Jones Day. In February 2014, the case ended with a settlement in which Liberation Music admitted wrongdoing in issuing the takedown notice, issued an apology, and paid a confidential sum in compensation.\n\"Killswitch\".\nIn October 2014, \"Killswitch\", a film featuring Lawrence Lessig, as well as Aaron Swartz, Tim Wu, and Edward Snowden received its World Premiere at the Woodstock Film Festival, where it won the award for Best Editing. In the film, Lessig frames the story of two young hacktivists, Swartz and Snowden, who symbolize the disruptive and dynamic nature of the Internet. The film reveals the emotional bond between Lessig and Swartz, and how it was Swartz (the mentee) who challenged Lessig (the mentor) to engage in the political activism that has led to Lessig's crusade for campaign finance reform.\nIn February 2015, \"Killswitch\" was invited to be screened at the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington, D.C., by Congressman Alan Grayson. The event was held on the eve of the Federal Communications Commission's historic decision on Net Neutrality. Lessig, Congressman Grayson, and Free Press CEO Craig Aaron spoke about the importance of protecting net neutrality and the free and open Internet.\nCongressman Grayson states that Killswitch is \"One of the most honest accounts of the battle to control the Internet -- and access to information itself.\" Richard von Busack of the Metro Silicon Valley, writes of \"Killswitch\", \"Some of the most lapidary use of found footage this side of The Atomic Caf\u00e9\". Fred Swegles of the Orange County Register, remarks, \"Anyone who values unfettered access to online information is apt to be captivated by \"Killswitch\", a gripping and fast-paced documentary.\" Kathy Gill of GeekWire asserts that \"\"Killswitch\" is much more than a dry recitation of technical history. Director Ali Akbarzadeh, producer Jeff Horn, and writer Chris Dollar created a human centered story. A large part of that connection comes from Lessig and his relationship with Swartz.\"\nThe Electors Trust.\nIn December 2016 Lawrence Lessig and Laurence Tribe established The Electors Trust under the aegis of EqualCitizens.US to provide pro bono legal counsel as well as a secure communications platform for those of the 538 members of the United States Electoral College regarding a vote of conscience against Donald Trump in the presidential election.\nLessig hosts the podcast \"Another Way\" in conjunction with The Young Turks Network.\nArtificial intelligence.\nLessig came out in favor of a \"right to warn\" proposed by former OpenAI employees that would protect their right to warn the public of the catastrophic risks of AI. Lessig also agreed to work pro bono in defense of the whistleblowers.\nIn August 2024, Lessig co-authored a letter alongside AI researchers Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Stuart Russell in favor of SB 1047, a California AI safety bill that would require companies training the most powerful models to perform risk assessments on their models before release. The letter argued that the bill would be a first step towards mitigating the severe risks posed by AI, and \"the bare minimum for effective regulation of this technology\". Lessig said that Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California, would have the opportunity to \"cement California as a national first-mover in regulating AI.\"\nMoney-in-politics activism.\nAt the iCommons iSummit 07, Lessig announced that he would stop focusing his attention on copyright and related matters in order to work on political corruption instead, as the result of a transformative conversation with Aaron Swartz, a young internet prodigy whom Lessig met through his work with Creative Commons. This new work was partially facilitated through his wiki, Lessig Wiki, through which he has encouraged the public to document cases of corruption. Lessig criticized the revolving-door phenomenon in which legislators and staffers leave office to become lobbyists and after having become beholden to special interests.\nIn February 2008, a Facebook group formed by law professor John Palfrey encouraged Lessig to run for Congress from California's 12th congressional district, the seat vacated by the death of Representative Tom Lantos. Later that month, after forming an \"exploratory project\", he decided not to run for the vacant seat.\nRootstrikers.\nDespite having decided to forgo running for Congress, Lessig remained interested in attempting to change Congress to reduce corruption. To this end, he worked with political consultant Joe Trippi to launch a web based project called \"Change Congress\". In a press conference on March 20, 2008, Lessig explained that he hoped the Change Congress website would help provide technological tools voters could use to hold their representatives accountable and reduce the influence of money on politics. He is a board member of MAPLight.org, a nonprofit research group illuminating the connection between money and politics.\nChange Congress later became \"Fix Congress First\", and was finally named Rootstrikers. In November 2011, Lessig announced that Rootstrikers would join forces with Dylan Ratigan's \"Get Money Out\" campaign, under the umbrella of the United Republic organization. Rootstrikers subsequently came under the aegis of Demand Progress, an organization co-founded by Aaron Swartz.\nArticle V convention.\nIn 2010, Lessig began to organize for a national Article V convention. He co-founded \"Fix Congress First!\" with Joe Trippi. In a speech in 2011, Lessig revealed that he was disappointed with Obama's performance in office, criticizing it as a \"betrayal\", and he criticized the president for using \"the (Hillary) Clinton playbook\". Lessig has called for state governments to call for a national Article V convention, including by supporting Wolf-PAC, a national organization attempting to call an Article V convention to address the problem. The convention Lessig supports would be populated by a \"random proportional selection of citizens\" which he suggested would work effectively. He said \"politics is a rare sport where the amateur is better than the professional.\" He promoted this idea at a September 24\u201325, 2011, conference he co-chaired with the Tea Party Patriots' national coordinator, in Lessig's October 5, 2011, book, \"Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress\u2014and a Plan to Stop It,\" and at the Occupy protest in Washington, D.C. Reporter Dan Froomkin said the book offers a manifesto for the Occupy Wall Street protestors, focusing on the core problem of corruption in both political parties and their elections. An Article V convention does not dictate a solution, but Lessig would support a constitutional amendment that would allow legislatures to limit political contributions from non-citizens, including corporations, anonymous organizations, and foreign nationals and he also supports public campaign financing and electoral college reform to establish the one person, one vote principle.\nNew Hampshire Rebellion.\nThe New Hampshire Rebellion is a walk to raise awareness about corruption in politics. The event began in 2014 with a 185-mile march in New Hampshire. In its second year the walk expanded to include other locations in New Hampshire.\nFrom January 11 to January 24, 2014, Lessig and many others, such as New York activist Jeff Kurzon, marched from Dixville Notch, New Hampshire to Nashua (a 185-mile march) to promote the idea of tackling \"the systemic corruption in Washington\". Lessig chose this language over the related term \"campaign finance reform\", commenting in an interview with the Carnegie Council that the term \"sounds like an alcoholic as someone who has a liquid intake problem.\" The walk was to continue the work of New Hampshire native Doris \"Granny D\" Haddock, and in honor of deceased activist Aaron Swartz. The New Hampshire Rebellion marched 16 miles from Hampton to New Castle on the New Hampshire Seacoast. The initial location also was chosen because of its important and visible role in the quadrennial \"New Hampshire primaries\", the traditional first primary of the presidential election.\n2016 presidential candidacy.\nLessig announced the launch of his long shot presidential campaign on September 6, 2015.\nOn August 11, 2015, Lessig announced that he had launched an exploratory campaign for the purpose of exploring his prospects of winning the Democratic Party nomination for president of the United States in the 2016 election. Lessig pledged to seek the nomination if he raised one million dollars by Labor Day 2015. The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in \"The New York Times\" and Bloomberg. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media. His campaign was focused on a single issue: The Citizen Equality Act, a proposal that couples campaign finance reform with other laws aimed at curbing gerrymandering and ensuring voting access. As an expression of his commitment to the proposal, Lessig initially promised to resign once the Citizen Equality Act became law and turn the presidency over to his vice president, who would then serve out the remainder of the term as a typical American president and act on a variety of issues. In October 2015, Lessig abandoned his automatic resignation plan and adopted a full policy platform for the presidency, although he did retain the passage of the Citizen Equality Act as his primary legislative objective.\nLessig made a single campaign stop in Iowa, with an eye toward the first-in-the-nation precinct caucuses: at Dordt College, in Sioux Center, in late October. He announced the end of his campaign on November 2, 2015.\nElectoral College reform.\nIn 2017, Lessig announced a movement to challenge the winner-take-all Electoral College vote allocation in the various states, called \"Equal Votes\". Lessig was also a counsel for electors in the Supreme Court case \"Chiafalo v. Washington\" where the court decided states could force electors to follow the popular vote for their state.\nAwards and honors.\nIn 2002, Lessig received the Award for the Advancement of Free Software from the Free Software Foundation (FSF). He also received the Scientific American 50 Award for having \"argued against interpretations of copyright that could stifle innovation and discourse online.\" In 2006, Lessig was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nIn 2011, Lessig was named to the Fastcase 50, \"honoring the law's smartest, most courageous innovators, techies, visionaries, and leaders.\" Lessig was awarded honorary doctorates by the Faculty of Social Sciences at Lund University, Sweden in 2013 and by the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain in 2014. Lessig received the 2014 Webby Lifetime Achievement award for co-founding Creative Commons and defending net neutrality and the free and open software movement.\nPersonal life.\nIn May 2005, it was revealed that Lessig had experienced sexual abuse by the director at the American Boychoir School, which he had attended as an adolescent. Lessig reached a settlement with the school in the past, under confidential terms. He revealed his experiences in the course of representing another student victim, John Hardwicke, in court. In August 2006, he succeeded in persuading the New Jersey Supreme Court to radically restrict the scope of immunity, which had protected nonprofits that failed to prevent sexual abuse from legal liability.\nLessig is married to Bettina Neuefeind, a German-born Harvard University colleague. The two married in 1999. He and Neuefeind have three children: Willem, Coffy, and Tess.\nDefamation lawsuit against \"The New York Times\".\nIn 2019, during the criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, it was discovered that the MIT Media Lab, under former director Joichi Ito, had accepted secret donations from Epstein after Epstein had been convicted on criminal charges. Ito eventually resigned as director of the MIT Media Lab following this discovery. After making supportive comments to Ito, Lessig wrote a Medium post in September 2019 to explain his stance. In his post, Lessig acknowledged that universities should not take donations from convicted criminals such as Epstein who had become wealthy through actions unrelated to their criminal convictions; however, if such donations were to be accepted, it was better to take them secretly rather than publicly connect the university to the criminal. Lessig's essay drew criticism, and about a week later, Nellie Bowles of \"The New York Times\" had an interview with Lessig in which he reiterated his stance related to such donations broadly. The article used the headline \"A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein\u2019s Money, Do It in Secret\", which Lessig confirmed was based on a statement he had made to the \"Times\". Lessig took issue with the headline overlooking his argument that MIT should not accept such donations in the first place and also criticized the first two lines of the article which read \"It is hard to defend soliciting donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law professor, has been trying.\" He subsequently accused the \"Times\" of writing clickbait with the headline crafted to defame him, and stated that the circulation of the article on social media had hurt his reputation.\nIn January 2020, Lessig filed a defamation lawsuit against the \"Times\", including writer Bowles, business editor Ellen Pollock, and executive editor Dean Baquet. The \"Times\" stated they would \"vigorously\" defend against Lessig's claim, and believed that what they had published was accurate and had been reviewed by senior editors following Lessig's initial complaints. In April 2020, \"The New York Times\" changed its original headline to read: \"What Are the Ethics of Taking Tainted Funds? A conversation with Lawrence Lessig about Jeffrey Epstein, M.I.T. and reputation laundering.\" Lessig reported he subsequently withdrew his defamation lawsuit.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Administratively, the island belongs to the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. Wolin is separated from the island of Usedom (Uznam) by the Strait of \u015awina, and from mainland Pomerania by the Strait of Dziwna. The island has an area of and its highest point is Mount Grzywacz at 116 m above sea level. The number of inhabitants is 30,000. Eastern suburbs of the city of \u015awinouj\u015bcie extend to the Wolin island, while the towns of Mi\u0119dzyzdroje and Wolin lie further east.\nWater from the river Oder flows into the Szczecin Lagoon and from there through the Peene west of Usedom, \u015awina and Dziwna into the Bay of Pomerania in the Baltic Sea.\nMost of the island consists of forests and postglacial hills. In the middle is the Wolin National Park. The island is the main tourist attraction of northwestern Poland, and it is crossed by several marked tourist trails, such as a trail from Mi\u0119dzyzdroje to Dziwn\u00f3wek. There is a main, electrified rail line, which connects Szczecin and \u015awinouj\u015bcie, as well as the international road E65 (national road 3 / S3 expressway) crossing the island.\nSome etymologists believe that the name is related to the name of the ancient historical region of Volhynia. The origins of the name then would come from the resettled Volynians who named the island Volyn.\nHistory.\nThe ford across the river Dziwna on which Wolin is located has been used as far back as the Stone Age. Archaeological excavations of soil layers indicate that there was a settlement in the area during the Migration period, at the turn of the 5th and 6th centuries. The place was then abandoned for approximately one hundred years. At the end of the 8th or the beginning of the 9th century, the area was levelled and a new settlement constructed. The earliest evidence of fortifications dates to the first half of the 9th century. In the second half of the 9th century, there was a central fortified area and two suburbs, to the north and south of the center. These became enclosed and fortified between the end of the 9th and the 10th centuries.\nA medieval document from the mid-9th century, called the \"Bavarian Geographer\" after its anonymous creator, mentions the Slavic tribe of Wolinians who had 70 strongholds at that time (\"Uelunzani civitates LXX\"). The town of Wolin was first mentioned in 965, by Ibrahim ibn Jakub, who referred to the place as \"Weltaba\".\nThe period of greatest development during the medieval period was between the 9th and the 11th centuries. Around 896 AD a new port was constructed and the main part of the town acquired new, stronger fortifications, including a wooden palisade made of halved 50-centimetre wide tree trunks, a rampart and a retaining wall.\nArchaeologists believe that in the Early Middle Ages Wolin was a great trade emporium, spreading along the shore for four kilometres and rivalling in importance Birka and Hedeby.\nIn 967, the island became controlled by Poland, under the country's first historic ruler, Duke Mieszko I. However, it has not been established if Wolin became directly part of Poland, or if it was a fief. Mieszko I encompassed the town of Wolin with defensive ramparts. Polish influences were not firm and they ended around 1007. In the following years, Wolin became famous for its pirates, who would plunder ships cruising the Baltic. As a reprisal, in 1043 it was attacked by the Norwegian king Magnus the Good.\nIn the early 12th century, the island, as part of the Pomeranian duchy, was captured by the Polish monarch Boleslaw III Wrymouth. Shortly after, the inhabitants of Wolin accepted Christianity, and in 1140 pope Innocent II created a diocese there, with its capital in the town of Wolin. In 1170, the battle at Julin Bridge took place there. In 1185 the dukes of Pomerania became vassals of Denmark, and in 1227, they fell under suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire.\nIn 1535, Wolin accepted Protestant Lutheranism. In 1630, during the Thirty Years' War, the island was captured by Sweden. It passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1720 as a result of the Treaty of Stockholm. From 1871, the island was part of the German Empire. During World War II, in February 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Allied prisoners-of-war from the Stalag XX-B POW camp passed through the island. After Nazi Germany's defeat in the war, it became again part of Poland.\nIn 1949\u20131950, a military hospital was based on the island, in which some 2,000 wounded or ill Greeks and Macedonians, partisans and refugees of the Greek Civil War, were treated by the Poles.\nIn 2015, the \u015awinouj\u015bcie LNG terminal was opened.\nConnection with Jomsborg and Vineta.\nArchaeological finds on the island are not very rich but they dot an area of 20 hectares, making it the second largest Baltic marketplace of the Viking Age after Hedeby. Some scholars have speculated that Wolin may have been the basis for the semi-legendary settlements Jomsborg and Vineta. However, others have rejected the identification, or even the historical existence of Jomsborg and Vineta (for example, Gerard Labuda).\nGwyn Jones notes that the size of the town was exaggerated in contemporary sources, for example by Adam of Bremen who claimed Wolin/Jomsborg was \"the largest town in Europe\". Archaeological excavations, however, have found no evidence of a harbor big enough for 360 warships (as claimed by Adam) or of a major citadel. The town was inhabited by both Slavs and Scandinavians.\nA golden disc bearing the name of Harald Bluetooth and Jomsborg appeared in Sweden in autumn 2014. The disc, also called the Curmsun Disc, is made of high gold content and has a weight of 25,23 gram. On the obverse there is a Latin inscription and on the reverse there is a Latin cross with four dots surrounded by an octagonal ridge. The inscription reads: \"+ARALD CVRMSVN+REX AD TANER+SCON+JVMN+CIV ALDIN+\" and translates as \"Harald Gormsson king of Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, town Aldinburg\".\nIt is assumed that the disc was a part of a Viking hoard found in 1840 in the Polish village Wiejkowo near the town of Wolin by Heinrich Boldt, the maternal great-great-grandfather of Hollywood actors and producers Ben Affleck and Casey Affleck.\nThe disc was rediscovered in 2014 by an eleven year old schoolgirl who found it in an old casket and then brought it to school.\nSights.\nAmong the natural, historic and tourist sights of Wolin are:\nCulture.\nAnnually, the island is home to Europe's biggest Germanic-Slavic Viking festival.\nThe officially protected traditional alcoholic beverage of Wolin is \"Tr\u00f3jniak woli\u0144ski le\u015bny\" (as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland).

It was already a major settlement at the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC (Early Bronze Age), but it is world-renowned for its significance at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC (Middle Bronze Age). The archaeological site consists of a large mound (also known as h\u00f6y\u00fck, tepe or tell), and a lower city, where a \"k\u0101rum\" (the Assyrian word for trading district) was established in the beginning of the 2nd Millennium BC. So far, 23,500 cuneiform tablets recovered from private houses constitute the largest collection of private texts in the ancient Near East. In 2014, the archaeological site was inscribed in the Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey.\nHistory.\nK\u00fcltepe is located about 20\u00a0km northeast from the modern city Kayseri. Its ancient name is recorded in Assyrian and Hittite sources. In Assyrian inscriptions from the 20th and the 19th century BC, the city was mentioned as Kane\u0161 (also transcribed as Kanesh); in later Hittite inscriptions, the city was mentioned as Ne\u0161a (sometimes transcribed as Nesha, Nessa or Nesa. Ne\u0161a derives from [Ka]ne\u0161a). \nThe site is divided into two main areas: the circular mound (tepe, h\u00f6y\u00fck) and the lower town to its northeast. The mound was inhabited (with discontinuity) from the Early Bronze Age through the Roman Empire, while the lower town was occupied only from the last decades of the third millennium to the early sixteenth century BCE. The lower town displays four levels of occupation, with only levels II (approximately 1945\u20131835 BCE) and Ib (approximately 1832\u20131700 BCE)\u2014which roughly correspond to the Middle Bronze Age\u2014yielding significant written records, totaling around 22,200 and 560 tablets, respectively. In contrast, only forty scattered tablets were found on the mound, where palaces and temples were uncovered, indicating that there are no surviving archives from the local authorities, if such archives ever existed. This \"k\u0101rum\" appears to have served as \"the administrative and distribution centre of the entire Assyrian colony network in Anatolia\". A late record, from circa 1400 BC, recounts the story of a king of Kane\u0161 called Zipani, with seventeen local city-kings who rose up against Naram-Sin of Akkad, who ruled circa 2254\u20132218 BC.\nDuring the \"k\u0101rum\" period, and before the conquest of Pit\u1e2bana, these local kings reigned in Kane\u0161: \nThe king of Zalpuwa, U\u1e2bna, raided Kane\u0161, after which the Zalpuwans carried off the city's \"\u0160iu\u0161\" idol. Pit\u1e2bana, the king of Ku\u0161\u0161ara, conquered Ne\u0161a \"in the night, by force\", but \"did not do evil to anyone in it\". Ne\u0161a revolted against the rule of Pit\u1e2bana's son, Anitta, but Anitta quashed the revolt and made Ne\u0161a his capital. Anitta further invaded Zalpuwa, captured its king Huzziya, and recovered the \"\u0160iu\u0161\" idol for Ne\u0161a.\nIn the 17th century BC, Anitta's descendants moved their capital to Hattusa, which Anitta had cursed, thus founding the line of Hittite kings. The inhabitants thus referred to the Hittite language as \"Ne\u0161ili\" 'the Ne\u0161a tongue'.\nArchaeology.\n \nBy 1880, cuneiform tablets said to be from \"Kara Eyuk\" ('black village') or \"Gyul Tep\u00e9\" ('burnt mound') near \"Kaisariyeh\", had begun to appear on the market, some being thus bought by the British Museum. In response the site was worked by Ernest Chantre for two seasons, beginning in 1893.\nHugo Grothe dug a small soundage in 1906.\nIn 1925, Bed\u0159ich Hrozn\u00fd excavated K\u00fcltepe and found over 1000 cuneiform tablets, some of which ended up in Prague and in Istanbul. In 1929 the site was visited\nand photographed by James Henry Breasted of the Oriental Institute of Chicago. There had been much digging for fertilizer, which had destroyed a quarter of the mound.\nModern archaeological work began in 1948, when K\u00fcltepe was excavated by a team from the Turkish Historical Society and the General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums. The team was led by Tahsin \u00d6zg\u00fc\u00e7 until his death, in 2005. After 2005 the excavation was directed by Fikri Kulako\u011flu.\nSome attribute Level II's burning to the conquest of the city of Assur by the kings of Eshnunna, but Bryce blames it on the raid of Uhna. Some attribute Level Ib's burning to the fall of Assur, other nearby kings and eventually to Hammurabi of Babylon.\nTo date, over 22,000 cuneiform tablets have been recovered from the site, mainly from the \"k\u0101rum\", with only 40 found in the Upper city.\nSubsequent excavations attested the following stratigraphy of K\u00fcltepe:\nRecently, in \"a small cell-plan structure cutting the walls of the monumental building [o]f K\u00fcltepe [Level 13], dated to the second half of the 3rd Millennium BC, statuettes made of alabaster with various attributes and ritual vessels in unprecedented forms were found in situ,\" and inside a \"monumental building [d]iscovered in 2018 [which] contains a room called the 'idol room,' [a] collection of the largest number of idols and statuettes ever discovered in the ancient Near East [was found].\"\n\"K\u0101rum\" Kane\u0161.\nThe quarter of the city that most interests historians is the \"k\u0101rum\", a portion of the city that was set aside by local officials for the early Assyrian merchants to use without paying taxes as long as the goods remained inside the \"k\u0101rum\". The term \"k\u0101rum\" means \"port\" in Akkadian, the \"lingua franca\" of the time, but its meaning was later extended to refer to any trading colony whether or not it bordered water.\nSeveral other cities in Anatolia also had a \"k\u0101rum\", but the largest was Kane\u0161, whose important \"k\u0101rum\" was inhabited by soldiers and merchants from Assyria for hundreds of years. They traded local tin and wool for luxury items, foodstuffs, spices and woven fabrics from the Assyrian homeland and Elam.\nThe remains of the \"k\u0101rum\" form a large circular mound 500\u00a0m in diameter and about 20\u00a0m above the plain (a tell). The \"k\u0101rum\" settlement is the result of several superimposed stratigraphic periods. New buildings were constructed on top of the remains of the earlier periods so there is a deep stratigraphy from prehistoric times to the early Hittite period.\nThe \"k\u0101rum\" was destroyed by fire at the end of levels II and Ib. The inhabitants left most of their possessions behind, as found by modern archaeologists.\nThe findings have included numerous baked-clay tablets, some of which were enclosed in clay envelopes stamped with cylinder seals. The documents record common activities, such as trade between the Assyrian colony and the city-state of Assur and between Assyrian merchants and local people. The trade was run by families rather than the state. The K\u00fcltepe texts are the oldest documents from Anatolia. Although they are written in Old Assyrian, the Hittite loanwords and names in the texts are the oldest record of any Indo-European language. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use of both cuneiform and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.\nDating of War\u0161ama Sarayi.\nAt Level II, the destruction was so total that no wood survived for dendrochronological studies. In 2003, researchers from Cornell University dated wood in level Ib from the rest of the city, built centuries earlier. The dendrochronologists date the bulk of the wood from buildings of the War\u0161ama Sarayi to 1832 BC, with further refurbishments up to 1779 BC.\nIn 2016 new research using radiocarbon dating and dendrology on timber used in this site and the palace in Acemh\u00f6y\u00fck show the likely earliest use of the palace as not before 1851\u20131842 BC (68.2% hpd) or 1855\u20131839 BC (95.4% hpd). In combination with the many Assyrian objects found here, this dating shows that only middle or low-middle chronology are the only remaining possible chronologies that fit these new data.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The band was formed in 1991 by vocalist Brandon Boyd, lead guitarist Mike Einziger, and drummer Jos\u00e9 Pasillas while enrolled in Calabasas High School and later expanded to include bassist Alex \"Dirk Lance\" Katunich, and Gavin \"DJ Lyfe\" Koppel; the latter two were eventually replaced by bassist Ben Kenney and DJ Kilmore, respectively. Nicole Row replaced Kenney in 2024. \nAfter their first two albums, \"Fungus Amongus\" (1995) and \"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\" (1997), Incubus earned mainstream recognition with the release of their 1999 album \"Make Yourself\" which spawned several hits, including the US Top 10 hit \"Drive\", and was certified double platinum in the US. Success continued with the albums \"Morning View\" (2001) and \"A Crow Left of the Murder...\" (2004), which both debuted at number 2 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. Their sixth studio album, \"Light Grenades\" (2006), was their first to debut at number 1 in the US. In 2009, Incubus released their first greatest hits album \"Monuments and Melodies\". Two years later, they released their seventh studio album \"If Not Now, When?\"., which debuted at number 2 in the US. The band also released an EP, \"Trust Fall (Side A)\", in early 2015, and two years later, the band released their eighth studio album, titled \"8\", on April 21, 2017. A second EP, \"Trust Fall (Side B)\", was released on April 17, 2020. \nAs of October 2022, Incubus has generated 12.4 million U.S. album consumption units and over 23 million records worldwide. The band has received numerous award nominations, including nominations from the \"Billboard\" Music Awards, the American Music Awards, and the Grammy Awards.\nHistory.\nFormation, \"Fungus Amongus\" and \"Enjoy Incubus\" (1991\u20131996).\nIncubus was formed in 1991 by vocalist Brandon Boyd, guitarist Mike Einziger, bassist Alex Katunich and drummer Jos\u00e9 Pasillas, while the members were in high school. They existed as a band for some time before they gave themselves a name, having only chosen the band's name \"Incubus\" when required to supply a band name for an upcoming show. The band's early shows were frequently at nightclubs on Los Angeles's Sunset Strip, including such well-known venues as the Whisky a Go Go, the Roxy and the Troubadour. Early on the members of Incubus bonded over Phish and Primus and used their grassroots approach as a model for their career.\nIncubus produced many of their early recordings with Jim Wirt and Chillum Records in the Santa Monica studio 4th Street Recording, only able to work on their music during hours in which they were not in school. In 1994, they recorded their first two-song EP, \"Let Me Tell Ya 'Bout Root Beer\". This was later followed by the debut album \"Fungus Amongus\", also recorded with Wirt and released on Incubus's own label \"Stopuglynailfungus Music\". Incubus then added Gavin Koppel (known by his stage name DJ Lyfe) to the band. In the following year, Incubus signed a seven-record deal with Sony's Immortal Records, later to become Epic Records. The group was spotted by Epic/Immortal A&amp;R Paul Pontius, who was also responsible for signing Korn to the label. The 1997 six-track EP \"Enjoy Incubus\" was the band's first major-label release and was created so the band could present a recording while touring with Korn in Europe.\n\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\" (1997\u20131998).\n\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\", Incubus's second studio album, was released on September 9, 1997. After their album release, they started opening for bands such as Korn and 311. This album marked a stylistic departure from the band's early material, featuring heavy guitar riffs, slap bass and turntables to create their most nu metal album. In February 1998, Incubus dismissed Koppel (DJ Lyfe). A friend recommended Chris Kilmore (DJ Kilmore) to fill the position. The band enjoyed Kilmore's style and attitude towards life and asked him to join the band. Incubus participated in the Ozzfest and Family Values metal festivals and toured with System of a Down and Ultraspank during the fall.\n\"Make Yourself\" (1999\u20132000).\nAfter constant touring throughout 1998, and after selling over 100,000 copies of \"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\" without the support of radio or television exposure, Incubus took a break for two years and then began working on their third album \"Make Yourself\". After just two weeks in the studio with producer Jim Wirt, the band was unhappy with the recordings and opted to continue recording without a producer. After another three weeks of recording, R.E.M./Nirvana producer Scott Litt took an interest in their songs and started taking part in the recording sessions, mainly focusing on songs like \"Drive\" and \"Stellar\". According to the band, Litt's involvement in the record came mostly during the mixing process.\n\"Make Yourself\" was released on October 26, 1999. The album marked the beginning of a more commercially acceptable pop rock and alternative rock sound for the band, although several songs from the album still included elements of nu/alternative metal, such as downtuned riffs and layers of electronics. Right after their album's release, the band went on tour with Primus and Buckethead, a tour which lasted for the remainder of the year. The first song that kicked off the album, \"Privilege\", was featured on \"MTV Sports: Pure Ride\" for the PlayStation. The band also released the single, \"Pardon Me\", but it was initially not well received by radio stations. Brandon and Mike decided to perform a live acoustic version of the song at the few radio stations who were showing interest, and this in turn spread the word of the song. Many radio stations began to play the acoustic version, including the influential Los Angeles radio giant KROQ-FM.\nWith sparked interest in the song, radio stations began playing the studio version of \"Pardon Me\". In response, Incubus made a video for the song and released a six-song EP titled \"When Incubus Attacks (Vol. 1)\" on August 22, 2000. The EP contained the acoustic version of \"Pardon Me\". In its first week, the EP sold nearly 40,000 copies, and peaked at No. 41 on the \"Billboard\" 200. To start off 2000, the band headed out on Tour with System of a Down, and Mr. Bungle until March, at which point they embarked on a headline tour in clubs until April.\nDue to the success of \"Pardon Me\", \"Make Yourself\" reached Gold certification (500,000 copies sold) in April 2000. Incubus continued to tour overseas, and returned home at the end of May to go on a tour of the United States with longtime friends 311. \"Stellar\", the next single from the album was soon released, and its video received afternoon airplay on MTV and \"TRL\", becoming a success on the Alternative chart. In July, Incubus were once again on the Ozzfest bill, until the late summer.\nThe band then took a short break after finishing the Ozzfest 2000 Tour, playing two acoustic shows at Artist Direct Studios. On October 5, 2000, \"Make Yourself\" went Platinum (one million copies sold), and shortly after, the band went on tour with Deftones. Sony re-released their independent debut album \"Fungus Amongus\" on November 7, 2000.\nOn November 14, 2000, the band released \"Drive\", the third single from \"Make Yourself\". It moved quickly up to the top of the Alternative Charts, eventually hitting the No. 1 spot. The single was a success and helped the band break into the mainstream. The single eventually reached the top ten of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart.\nAfter a ten-year break from the music business in 2000, thrash metal band Opprobrium (formed in 1986 under the name Incubus) were forced to change their name in order to avoid confusion and a lawsuit.\n\"Morning View\" (2001\u20132002).\nThe band took a break during the first part of 2001 before heading to a beachside mansion in Malibu, California, to record their follow-up album, which would later become known as \"Morning View\".\nThey began touring once more with Hundred Reasons in Europe from June until the first week of July. At this time, the band was invited to play with the Area 1 Festival, which featured Moby, Outkast, the Roots, Paul Oakenfold, Carl Cox, and Nelly Furtado. Also, in July, \"Make Yourself\" was certified double-platinum, selling 2 million copies. In August, the band got to play their first shows in Australia and Japan, before returning to the United States to begin their headlining tour with their long-time friends from California, Hoobastank. Meanwhile, the band's video for \"Drive\" was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the category of Best Group Video.\nContinuing to tour, Incubus released their first single, \"Wish You Were Here\", from their upcoming record, \"Morning View\", on August 21, 2001. The single instantly began to climb up the Alternative charts, reaching No. 2 by early September. The music video was released at the end of that month, after being re-cut to make it more viewable in the wake of the 9/11 disaster. The video earned viewings on MTV's TRL, VH1, and MuchMusic. Their follow-up single was \"Nice to Know You\".\nOn October 23, 2001, the band released their fourth full-length major label album. The name was taken from the street on which the band's recording studio was situated. Incubus continued to headline dates after its release, and \"Wish You Were Here\" continued to sit among the top 10 on \"Billboard\"'s Alternative charts. \"Morning View\" debuted on the Billboard Top 200 at the No. 2 spot (266,000 copies were sold in its first week). This was the highest ever placement for Incubus. At the same time, \"Wish You Were Here\" was at No. 2 on the Alternative Charts, and \"Drive\" sat at No. 48 on the Hot 100 chart. The band won an award for Billboard's Alternative Single of the Year for \"Drive\". By December, \"Morning View\" was certified platinum, \"Wish You Were Here\" was No. 4 on Alternative charts, and \"Morning View\" was No. 38 on top 200.\nOn December 11, Incubus released \"When Incubus Attacks (Vol. 2)\", a DVD-Video that featured music videos for \"Take Me to Your Leader\", \"A Certain Shade of Green\", \"Pardon Me\", \"Stellar\", \"Drive\", \"I Miss You\", and \"Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)\", live footage, backstage video, and more. Director Bill Draheim documented the making of \"Drive\". Save Me from my Half-Life Drive is the result of that edited EPK footage.\nTo begin 2002, Incubus was No. 9 with \"Drive\", No. 12 with \"Stellar\", No. 20 with \"Wish You Were Here\", No. 75 with \"Nice to Know You\" and No. 31 with the album \"Morning View\". On January 24, 2002, MTV's TRL premiered the \"Nice to Know You\" video, and Boyd called in from Europe where the band was on tour with 311 and Hoobastank. The band was then featured on MTV's \"Becoming\", TRL, \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", and played the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on February 14, 2002, all before heading off to play dates in Japan and Australia for the remainder of February and March. While in Sydney, the band shot the video for their next single, \"Warning\", from March 7 until March 11.\nThe band then released the DVD \"The Morning View Sessions\" on May 28, shortly before playing the Weenie Roast on June 8 for KROQ.\nIncubus issued a limited-edition version of \"Morning View\" on October 1 to coincide with their fall headlining tour. The new version of the album contained a DVD dubbed the \"Morning After View Session\". It featured the UK video for the group's track \"Are You In?\", tour footage, new artwork, behind-the-scenes material, and more. Incubus's last performance in 2002 (on November 1) brought several eras for the band to a close. Their last show of the tour would be their last show touring behind 2001's \"Morning View\", as the band looked on to playing new music. The show would also prove to be their last with bass player Dirk Lance, who left the band due to personal differences.\nLance was quietly replaced by former the Roots guitarist Ben Kenney, who began working with Einziger on new songs for a psychedelic jazz-funk project called Time-Lapse Consortium. Incubus ended the year on the charts, having \"Wish You Were Here\" (No. 10), \"Warning\" (No. 16), and \"Nice to Know You\" (No. 26) on the alternative rock format chart, joining \"Wish You Were Here\" (No. 25) and \"Nice to Know You\" (No. 36). \"Morning View\" was the 40th-best-selling album of 2002.\n\"A Crow Left of the Murder...\" (2003\u20132004).\nOn January 6, 2003, the band began writing for their next record. The next month, on February 7, the band began to renegotiate their record contract. The band, which had been signed to Epic/Immortal for seven years, cited the fact that state law limits the amount of time that an artist can be bound to a company. The band had been signed to the label for 7 years, and used California's de Havilland Law as a negotiating tool with Epic/Immortal. After releasing three successful albums, the band had been compensated poorly compared to the revenue that they had generated for Sony. The band entered a lawsuit against their label in order to break from their contract, to which Sony responded with a lawsuit of their own. On March 1, Einziger, along with Scott Litt, Dave Holdredge, and Rick Will, was nominated for a Grammy in the \"Best Engineered Album (Non Classical)\" category, for their work on \"Morning View\". On April 3, after weeks of circulating rumors about Dirk Lance's departure from the band, an official announcement was made by the band. A decision had been reached amongst members of Incubus in a face-to-face meeting at the end of the \"Morning View\" tour to discuss his involvement in the band. The band said that the split had become necessary due to \"irreconcilable creative differences\".\nAlmost immediately after the announcement of a new bass player, the 2003 Incubus vs. Sony case had been settled. The two sides settled on a new contract that delivers three albums to Epic/Immortal with an option on a fourth. The first album would be worth $8\u00a0million in advances to the band, with another $2.5\u00a0million for each one thereafter.\nBy December the new album, which was recorded at Southern Tracks Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia was recorded live, opposed to recording each instrument at separate times, and was produced by Brendan O'Brien (Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, Stone Temple Pilots) was completed and scheduled for release. Titled \"A Crow Left of the Murder...\", the album was to be an enhanced CD with behind-the-scenes video. In the videos, Einziger and Boyd discussed their new songs. Einziger described them as \"like the old shit, but older. It's very different. It's very energetic and fast, and a lot of it is more technical. I guess maybe in the vein of more of our older songs; they don't sound like our older songs. They are more exploratory.\" It was the last Incubus album to be labelled as \"alternative metal\" by the media, with subsequent albums from the band diverting even further from this sound. On December 15, 2003, the first single, \"Megalomaniac\", was released. It raised controversy when it was said to be an attack on the Bush administration, and was banned from daytime view on MTV (despite the band saying that it was not an attack on a particular person, rather a comment on some people's negative attitudes). However, the band was actually pleased with this nighttime viewing restriction. Says Boyd, \"When we heard our video had been relegated to late night rotation, I think that all of us were secretly like, 'Yes!' \". Pasillas reflected Boyd's sentiments, saying, \"I think it's okay if people think that we're trying to make a political statement. Whatever anyone conjures up or takes from our music is good; I mean, our point is to get people thinking.\"\n\"A Crow Left of the Murder...\" was released in 2004, showcasing a new turn for the band. The second single released was \"Talk Shows on Mute\", featuring a video that was inspired by George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\".\nIncubus toured worldwide in 2004 with many bands, including Ben Kweller, the Walkmen, Hundred Reasons, the Music, Brand New and Sparta, to promote their new album after their original support act the Vines pulled out due to exhaustion. One song left off the album, the 27-minute-long instrumental entitled \"The Odyssey\", was later featured on soundtrack for the video game, \"Halo 2\".\nIn November 2004, the band released a live DVD entitled \"Alive at Red Rocks\", filmed in Red Rocks Park, Colorado, during their world tour for \"A Crow Left of the Murder...\". Along with the DVD came a bonus CD featuring five tracks, including a studio version of live favorite \"Pantomime\", \"Follow\" (a lyrical version, different from the First Movement of the Odyssey version), and the UK B-side \"Monuments and Melodies\". Two live tracks were also included. The performance was also sold in high definition via Blu-ray Disc. A high definition version of the entire song \"Pardon Me\" is also available for free download from the PlayStation Store, an online service for PlayStation 3 users.\nIn December 2004, at a gig in Los Angeles the band played the Police hits \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\", \"Message in a Bottle\" and \"Roxanne\" with Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers from the former band.\n\"Light Grenades\" (2005\u20132008).\nIn the spring of 2005, the band went back into the studio with Brendan O'Brien. Three new songs were released in late July 2005 as part of the soundtrack album to the Sony film \"Stealth\". The track \"Make a Move\", was released to radio in late May, and song reached No. 17 (Alternative Charts) and No. 19 (Mainstream Rock Charts). Fan reaction towards \"Make a Move\" was lukewarm, but the other two new songs, \"Admiration\" and \"Neither of Us Can See\" (a duet with Chrissie Hynde), seemed to be much more well-liked. In January 2006, the first of a series of Incubus podcasts was released by the band via internet. Among other things, the podcast featured the band's thoughts about their 2005 South American tour, some information on their new album, a mash-up of \"Drive\" and Tupac Shakur's \"Better Dayz\", a cover of Soundgarden's \"Black Hole Sun\", and a few live interludes.\nOn August 1, 2006, the band announced that album number six, \"Light Grenades\", was soon to be released and that it was being produced by Brendan O'Brien. A few weeks afterward, the release date was confirmed to be Tuesday, November 28. Upon release, \"Light Grenades\" debuted No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200, the first time Incubus has ever sat atop the album charts, despite only selling 165,000 copies (their lowest debut for an album since \"Make Yourself\") in the first week.\nIn November, Incubus played two exclusive European shows in Berlin and London. These were both in less than 2,000-capacity venues\u2014a special occasion for the band and the fans (due to Incubus's mainstream success, the band now usually plays at large arenas worldwide). The band used these shows to showcase new material from \"Light Grenades\". The band's first single, \"Anna Molly\", had a music video which had mainstream success.\nOn December 27, 2006, Incubus launched the \"I Dig Incubus\" contest, in which participants cut together clips of the band performing their single \"Dig\", to form a complete music video. On February 1, 2007, five finalists were announced for the \"I Dig Incubus\" contest. In a video interview on \"Blender\", bassist and vocalist Ben Kenney said, \"It's almost something that will happen whether or not we want to do it. People will make their own videos for songs. It's kind of a cool way for us to get together with fans out there who are artistic.\" On August 4, 2007, Incubus played on the first day at Baltimore's Virgin Festival along with bands such as the Police and Beastie Boys.\nMichael Einziger had been suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome and although he had an operation that has corrected the problem, he needed to recuperate for a few months, hence recent tour plans were postponed. Incubus apologized to fans and continued the tour in the summer and autumn.\nIn February and March 2008, Incubus hit the road again starting in New Zealand and headlining the Soundwave festival in Australia alongside the Offspring and Alexisonfire, and toured Asia performing to sell-out crowds. In Singapore, they met fans at a Meet and Greet session at Changi Airport and performed at Fort Canning Hill.\nIn April, Incubus performed at the Festival Imperial in Costa Rica, along with the bands the Smashing Pumpkins and Duran Duran, and later in Venezuela at the Poliedro de Caracas.\nIncubus also performed a number of shows throughout Europe this summer including the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park Festivals in Germany, the Nova Rock Festival in Austria, Pinkpop Festival in the Netherlands and the Download Festival in England. In July 2008, the band played in a VH1 tribute to the Who alongside Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam and the Flaming Lips.\nHiatus and greatest hits album (2009\u20132010).\nIn April 2008 the band took a break from touring and recording while its members concentrated on school, family and other activities. Brandon Boyd enrolled in a university art program in Los Angeles, while guitarist Mike Einziger went to Harvard music school to study composition. Drummer Jos\u00e9 Pasillas was also \"having a baby, so there's a lot of normal life stuff going on right now\u2014school, babies, mortgages,\" Boyd said. \"I'm of the mind to say it wouldn't be a bad thing to disappear for a year or two years,\" he said. \"A lot of people would say culture moves too fast and you need to remind people, but I would argue there's not any rush.\"\nIn mid January 2009, Incubus posted a video to their official site, describing what each band member was occupied with in the form of letters to each other. The resolution of the video was that the band was planning on getting back together soon, excited to create new music with their diverse experiences over their respite.\nOn March 11, 2009, Incubus posted an update to their official site detailing the new greatest hits album, \"Monuments and Melodies\". The first single for the album was \"Black Heart Inertia\", released on April 7, 2009, with the album coming two months later on June 16, 2009. Disc one of the album included new singles \"Black Heart Inertia\" and \"Midnight Swim\" as well as the top radio hits of the last decade. Then disc two of the album contains songs that have not been released officially on an album, or were rejected demos on prior albums, as well as an acoustic version of \"A Certain Shade of Green\", and a cover of the Prince song \"Let's Go Crazy\". The band also announced many confirmed dates for a Summer Amphitheater Tour of the US.\nOn April 1, 2009, the band posted a fake \"making of\" video that was filmed on the set of \"Black Heart Inertia\". In the video, Brandon and his double \"swapped places\". Brandon fetched coffee for his double, and his double also imitated Christian Bale when the DP annoyed him, shouting at and violently chasing him out off of the set. After the short film, the first full stream of \"Black Heart Inertia\" was uploaded, clocking in at 4:17. On April 2, the full song was streamed on the band's official site. The song peaked at No. 7 on the Alternative Songs chart. \nOn June 16, 2009, \"Monuments and Melodies\" was released to the public, and opened at No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" 200. \"Monuments and Melodies\" was the band's fourth album to reach the top 5 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The next month, on July 1, 2009, Boyd stated to \"North County Times\", \"We are definitely going to be writing ... in hopes of putting out a record sometime in 2010. That's the hope. We can never force anything. I definitely have the suspicion that we're going to get on the road together this summer, and we're just going to start playing and stuff is going to start brewing, and we're going to light that fire again.\"\nIn January 2010, it was revealed that former turntablist Gavin \"DJ Lyfe\" Koppel threatened current turntablist Chris Kilmore in a store on December 28, 2009. Kilmore, who replaced Koppel in 1998, claimed that Koppel \"asked me to fight him right there and raised his fists to me.\" As result of the incident, a judge granted a new restraining order against Koppel. Kilmore also had a previous restraining order issued against Koppel in 2003 after Koppel allegedly spat in his face.\n\"If Not Now, When?\" (2011\u20132013).\nAfter the release of Boyd's first solo album, \"The Wild Trapeze\" on July 6, 2010, it was announced that Incubus would head back into the studio to begin writing and recording a new studio album, to be released on July 12. The band played a handful of South American tour dates in October 2010, also debuting the song \"Surface to Air\".\nIncubus announced in March 2011 that the new album was complete and would be released in \"August or September\" according to Brandon Boyd. Boyd also stated that \"this new record is different from anything that we've done.\"\nOn April 2, 2011, band manager Steve Rennie confirmed that their next album had been named \"If Not Now, When?\". It was released on July 12, 2011. The album's lead single is \"Adolescents\" and it was posted on the band's website on April 4, 2011.\nOn April 28, 2011, Incubus premiered the video for \"Adolescents\" and also released a video with behind the scenes footage.\nThe band revealed that they would tour for 18 months following the release of the record.\nTo promote the release of \"If Not Now, When?\", the band took part in a participatory media exhibit and real-time documentary called Incubus HQ Live that allowed unprecedented fan access and interaction. Footage, music and art from the seven-day event became available as a special edition box set in July 2012.\nMike has said that he is writing music for an orchestral project and also for Incubus. He states in a video (Mikey Gear Tour part II), \"My hope is to just write lots of music and then by the time we get to the point to where we're going to finish the tour I'll have a lot of music written and then people won't have to wait five more years for another album (laughs).\"\nThe band joined Linkin Park as co-headliners on the 2012 edition of the Honda Civic Tour. Incubus hinted that they would go on hiatus following the end of the 2012 Honda Civic Tour, but their manager stated that Incubus would only take a break after the tour, not a hiatus.\nIn October 2012, the band released their second compilation album. The album, entitled \"The Essential Incubus\", included songs spanning the band's major label career, from 1997's \"Enjoy Incubus\" EP to 2011's \"If Not Now, When?\".\nIn August 2013, the band announced a South American tour to take place later that year.\n\"Trust Fall (Side A)\" (2014\u20132015).\nIn a radio interview while on the road with his solo band Sons of the Sea, Brandon Boyd announced that fans can expect some new Incubus music in 2015, followed by a tour. Mike Einziger also reinforced this statement when asked on his Twitter page.\nIn August 2014, Einziger posted a picture of the band on his Instagram in a studio, alluding to the fact they were in the process of creating their album. Subsequently, a few days following the images of the band in a studio, they announced they would be attending the 2015 Soundwave music festival in Australia, alongside Faith No More and Soundgarden. They played at the KROQ's Almost Acoustic Christmas 2014 on December 14, their first full band appearance since December 2013. During their performance they debuted a new song called \"Trust Fall\". Incubus announced they will release two EP's in 2015 with the first, \"Trust Fall (Side A)\" set for release on May 12, 2015, having been delayed from March 24, 2015. The first single, \"Absolution Calling\", was released February 5, 2015, to be followed by the second single, \"Trust Fall\", on March 10, 2015.\nThey performed at Australia's Soundwave festival and two other concerts in Australia. In March 2015, they toured Japan, Hawaii and \"Festival Cumbre Taj\u00edn\" in Mexico. They headlined the DC101 Kerfuffle on May 4, 2015. In May and June 2015, they will play at two festivals in Germany (\"Rockavaria\" and \"Gr\u00fcne H\u00f6lle\"), one concert in Milan and at in Vienna. They will also be in London's Hammersmith Apollo on the June 16, 2015. Incubus also announced a joint 2015 North American Summer Tour with Deftones. Support will be provided by Death from Above 1979 for most concerts of the tour. The tour began on July 22, 2015, in Clarkston, Michigan, at the DTE Energy Music Theatre and with the final concert of the tour occurring on August 30, 2015, in Chula Vista, California, at the Sleep Train Amphitheatre.\n\"8\" (2016\u20132018).\nThe band reconvened in 2016 to work on their eighth full-length studio album. On February 16, 2017, the lead single \"Nimble Bastard\" was released, and it was announced that the new album would be titled \"8\", with a projected April 21 release date, with Skrillex contributing to the production and mixing of the album. A summer 2017 tour was announced with Jimmy Eat World and Judah &amp; the Lion supporting, and was followed by a world tour across several continents including South America, Asia, and Europe.\n\"Trust Fall (Side B)\", departure of Ben Kenney, \"Morning View XXIII\", and upcoming ninth studio album (2019\u2013present).\nThe band announced via its Twitter page that a new single titled \"Into the Summer\" would be released on August 23, 2019. The release of the single coincides with a US tour, to mark the 20th anniversary of \"Make Yourself\". In an interview with Loudwire on October 20, 2019, bassist Ben Kenney confirmed the band had completely finished four new songs and were working on more, but didn't confirm whether these songs would be released in the form of a new studio album or if they would be released as individual songs. On the matter he said \"We don't want to get stacked up in a studio making an album. We have to adapt our process 'cause the albums themselves don't actually make as big a splash as they used to. We're just trying to experiment and explore what we're capable of doing, and all the while not take ourselves too seriously and just really enjoy what we get to do.\" On January 1, 2020, singer Brandon Boyd announced their next single, \"Our Love\" will be released on January 31, 2020. The band were scheduled to tour the UK and other European destinations in 2020 but were forced to cancel their shows due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe band returned to touring in 2023; Kenney was forced to sit out the 2023 touring cycle after having surgery to remove a brain tumor; Tal Wilkenfeld took over bass duties until March, and Nicole Row from March onwards. On August 5, the band announced the release of \"Morning View XXIII\", a complete rerecording of their 2001 album set for release on October 6 (postponed to early 2024) by Virgin Music. They simultaneously announced a concert at the Hollywood Bowl where they would perform \"Morning View\" in full, supported by Paris Jackson and Action Bronson, for the same day.\nOn February 6, 2024, Brandon Boyd revealed via a \"Rolling Stone\" interview that while Ben Kenney had recovered, the bassist had decided to leave Incubus and that his tour replacement, Nicole Row, was now officially a member of the band. By that point Row had already played on the \"Morning View XXIII\" re-recording and was working with them on material for a new Incubus album.\nArtistry.\nMusical style.\n\"Las Vegas Weekly\" said that Incubus was a \"funky, jazzy, experimental rock band, incorporating elements of hip-hop into its music before it was fashionable to do so.\" According to \"AllMusic\", the band became \"one of the most popular alt-metal bands of the new millennium\" by combining heavy metal, funk, jazz, hip hop, techno, post-grunge, rap metal and alternative rock into a \"versatile blend\". \"The Age\" wrote that Incubus \"emerged bearing influences of pop, alternative metal and hip-hop, unusual for mainstream rock bands\". \"Indianapolis Monthly\" said that the band was \"part metal, part funk, part jazz and part hip-hop\". The \"McClatchy-Tribune News\" called Incubus a \"spacey, experimental alternative-rock band\". \"Rolling Stone\" said that the band were latecomers to \"the great funk metal scare of the '90s\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" similarly wrote in 2004 that \"Incubus always stood out from the rest of the mid-'90s alt-metal crowd, its positive lyrical approach and musical versatility far richer than the overworked wallowing in misery of such acts as Korn and later arrival Staind.\"\nPrior to finding mainstream success in the early 2000s, Incubus was often grouped in with nu metal, alongside other Californian bands such as Korn and Deftones. \"NME\" described Incubus as a \"fusion-generated funk/nu-metal band\". \"Maui Time Weekly\" wrote, \"Incubus was one of the few nu metal bands to survive the purge of the millennium, and they did it through consistent hard work\u2013the band is constantly either in the studio or on tour\u2013and musical development. There are still elements of nu metal in the music the band makes today as they still have a DJ. But in retrospect, Incubus treated that genre like the fad it was, more an indication of that specific time in music, not as the character of the musicians.\" When asked about his thoughts on the scene in a 2013 interview, Brandon Boyd reflected \"Something I know that separated us from nu-metal was a lot of those bands had misogynist lyrics, and we never wrote stuff like that. I never wrote lyrics like that. I guess there were similarities in some of my musical and vocal stylings, but then we came off tour for \"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\" around early '99, and wrote \"Make Yourself\", which was a vastly different album but we were still the same band. We don't try and create any kind of album really. I don't attempt to write any kind of music, this is just what comes out.\" The \"Chicago Tribune\" stated in 2001 that Incubus is \"Cheerful, melodic and polite, a nu-metal band for people who don't like nu-metal bands\" also claiming that Boyd was the genre's \"first official pinup boy\". \nFrom the mid-2000s, Incubus began to adopt a softer sound, moving from rock towards a \"funk-pop-rock\" sound. This was particularly apparent by \"If Not Now, When?\" (2011), which was described by \"Rolling Stone\" as \"slick, inert ripples of interchangeable power pop\". \"The Guardian\" compared the sound of \"8\" (2017) and its more ballad-like moments to Ed Sheeran. Their 2020 EP \"Trust Fall (side B)\" was described by \"Sputnik music\" as \"inoffensive pop\".\nInfluences.\nGuitarist Mike Einziger stated in 2017 that the band's diversity is \"our greatest asset and our biggest flaw. We don't fit anywhere and we never have. We were never punk rock enough for the Warped Tour, we were never metal enough for Ozzfest, we were never quite indie rock or cool enough for Lollapalooza. We've carved our own path, and we're really humbled by the fact that we've had so many supporters and people who appreciate our music.\" The band has also used a wide variety of instruments in their music that are not traditionally associated with use in rock music, including a djembe, sitar, didgeridoo, and bongos on many of their earlier tracks and during live performances, and with the use of a pipa given to the band by rock musician Steve Vai which is played by Einziger in the song \"Aqueous Transmission\".\nIncubus was heavily influenced by the \"free-form funk\" of Primus. Other influences on the band's sound include Faith No More, Ani DiFranco, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden and Phish. Boyd reflected on the band's initial influences in 2012, stating \"At that time [the early '90s] music got turned on its ear. We were listening to bands like Primus, Mr. Bungle, John Zorn, we also got into Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine. What's amazing is those bands are still good now, they're still relevant now. Alice in Chains, Red Hot Chili Peppers, these bands that were coming of age right when we were growing up, at that most important, kind of pliable time in your youth. We were basically so inspired by music, that we decided to make music on our own.\" Critics have compared Boyd's style of singing to Faith No More/Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, whom the band have also credited as a major influence.\nAwards and nominations.\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"row\"|Billboard Music Awards\n! scope=\"row\"|Billboard Music Awards\n! scope=\"row\"|Billboard Music Awards\n! scope=\"row\"|MTV Video Awards\n! scope=\"row\"|MuchMusic Video Awards\n! scope=\"row\"|Billboard Music Awards\n! scope=\"row\"|Teen Choice Awards\n! scope=\"row\"|Kerrang!

Common in African American communities, the Dozens is almost exclusively played in front of an audience, who encourage the participants to reply with increasingly severe insults in order to heighten the tension and consequently make the contest more interesting to watch. \nComments in the game may focus on the opposite player's intelligence, appearance, competency, social status, and financial situation. Disparaging remarks about the other player's family members are common, especially regarding their mother. Commentary is often related to sexual issues, and this version of the game is referred to as the \"Dirty Dozens\".\nAccording to sociologist Harry Lefever and journalist John Leland, the game is played almost entirely by African-Americans; other ethnic groups often fail to understand how to play the game and can take remarks in the Dozens seriously. Its popularity is higher among low-income and urban communities, but it is also found in middle-class and rural settings. Both men and women participate, but the game is more commonly played among men.\nTerminology.\nPlaying the Dozens is also known as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOrigins.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"dozens\" has long been debated as to its etymology, with urban legend abounding. The first academic treatment of the Dozens was made in 1939 by Yale-based psychologist and social theorist John Dollard, who described the importance of the game among African-American men, and how it is generally played. Dollard's description is considered pioneering and accurate. Dollard originally wrote that he was unaware of how the term \"dozens\" developed, although he suggested a popular twelve-part rhyme may have been the reason for its name. He only speculated on how the game itself grew to such prominence. \"Online Etymology Dictionary\" claims the origin, first attested in 1928, is probably from , in the original sense of 'a beating or thrashing'.\nOther authors following Dollard have added their theories; author John Leland describes an etymology, writing that the term is a modern dialectal survival of an English verb \u2014\"to dozen\"\u2014 dating back to at least the 14th century and meaning 'to stun, stupefy, daze' or 'to make insensible, torpid, powerless'.\nAuthor and professor Mona Lisa Saloy theorizes a different etymology in \"African American Oral Traditions in Louisiana\" (1998):\nThe dozens has its origins in the slave trade of New Orleans where deformed slaves\u2014generally slaves punished with mutilation for disobedience\u2014were grouped in lots of a 'cheap dozen' for sale to slave owners. For a Black to be sold as part of the 'dozens' was the lowest blow possible.\nAnthropology.\nAmuzie Chimezie, writing in the \"Journal of Black Studies\" in 1976, connects the Dozens to a Nigerian game called , literally translated as 'making disparaging remarks'. This form of the game is played by children and adolescents, and takes place in the evening, in the presence of parents and siblings. Commentary among the Igbo is more restrained: remarks about family members are rare, and are based more in fanciful imaginings than participants' actual traits. In contrast, during the game in Ghana, which is also commonly played in the evenings, insults are frequently directed at family members. \nAmiri Baraka independently concluded that the Dozens originated in Africa and states that they are a surviving adaptation of \"African songs of recrimination.\"\nPurpose and practice.\nThe Dozens is a \"pattern of interactive insult\" evident among all classes of African Americans, among men and women, children and adults. Usually two participants engage in banter, but always in front of others, who incite the participants to continue the game by making the insults worse. Frequently used topics among players who \"play the Dozens\" or are \"put in the Dozens\" are one's opponent's lack of intelligence, ugliness, alleged homosexuality, alleged incest, cowardice, poor hygiene, and exaggerations of physical defects, such as crossed eyes.\nParticipants in the Dozens are required to exhibit mental acuity and proficiency with words. In his memoir \"Die Nigger Die!\" (1969), H. Rap Brown writes that the children he grew up with employed the Dozens to kill time and stave off boredom, in the way that whites might play Scrabble. Brown asserts playing the game is a form of mental exercise. Sociologist Harry Lefever states that verbal skill and wit is just as valued among African Americans as physical strength: \"Verbal facility is thus a criterion that is used to separate the men from the boys\". According to author John Leland, the object of the game is to stupefy and daze one's opponents with swift and skillful speech. The meaning of the words, however, is lost in the game. The object of the game is the performance.\nAdolescents incorporate more sexual themes in their versions, often called the \"Dirty Dozens\". The language also becomes more playful, with participants including rhymes:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nI was walking through the jungle\nWith my dick in my hand\nI was the baddest motherfucker\nIn the jungle land\nI looked up in the tree\nAnd what did I see\nYour little black mama\nTrying to piss on me\nI picked up a rock\nAnd hit her in the cock\nAnd knocked that bitch\nAbout a half a block.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nMany forms of the Dozens address sexual situations or body parts:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nIf you wanta play the Dozens\nPlay them fast.\nI'll tell you how many bull-dogs\nYour mammy had.\nShe didn't have one;\nShe didn't have two;\nShe had nine damned dozens\nAnd then she had you.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nAnalysis.\nA variety of explanations have been offered for the popularity of the Dozens. Its development is intertwined with the oppression African Americans encountered, first as slaves and later as second-class citizens. \nJohn Dollard viewed the Dozens as a manifestation of frustration aggression theory, a theory that he helped develop. He hypothesized that African Americans, as victims of racism, have been unable to respond in kind towards their oppressors, and instead shifted their anger to friends and neighbors, as displayed in the strings of insults. Folklorist Alan Dundes asserted that an approach based on psychoanalytic theory and American oppression ignores the possibility that the Dozens may be native to Africa. In addition to similar forms of verbal combat found in Nigeria and Ghana, where many African Americans have ancestral roots, Bantu and Kisii boys have been observed dueling verbally by attacking each other's mothers.\nThe game is also viewed as a tool for preparing young African Americans to cope with verbal abuse without becoming enraged. The ability to remain composed during the Dozens is considered a hallmark of virtue among many African Americans. \nIn the deepest sense, the essence of the dozens lies not in the insults but in the response of the victim. Taking umbrage is considered an infantile response. Maturity and sophistication bring the capability to suffer the vile talk with aplomb at least, and, hopefully, with grace and wit.\nNonetheless, many such contests do end in fights. Abrahams states that when African Americans reach a certain age, between 16 and 26, the game loses much of its appeal and attempts to enter into sparring contests often result in violence. John Leland writes that the loser of the Dozens is the one who takes his opponent's words at face value, therefore ending his own performance in the back-and-forth exchange.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Playing the Dozens\" is referenced in Zora Neale Hurston's 1937 novel \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\", where Janie, the protagonist, returns her husband's insults with some of her own. \"Playing the dozens\" and \"signifying\" are also frequently referenced in Alston Anderson's 1959 short story collection \"Lover Man\". The sketch comedy show In Living Color featured a skit called \"The Dirty Dozens\" prominently featuring Jamie Foxx.\nFootnotes.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also known as divining (especially in water divining), doodlebugging (particularly in the United States, in searching for petroleum or treasure) or water finding, or water witching (in the United States).\nA Y-shaped twig or rod, or two L-shaped ones, called dowsing rods or divining rods are normally used, and the motion of these are said to reveal the location of the target material. The motion of such dowsing devices is generally attributed to random movement, or to the ideomotor phenomenon, a psychological response where a subject makes motions unconsciously.\nThe scientific evidence shows that dowsing is no more effective than random chance. It is therefore regarded as a pseudoscience.\nHistory.\nEarly divination and religion.\nDowsing originated in ancient times, when it was treated as a form of divination. The Catholic Church banned the practice completely.\nProtestant Reformer Martin Luther perpetuated the Catholic ban, in 1518 listing divining for metals as an act that broke the first commandment (i.e., as occultism).\nOld texts about searching for water do not mention using the divining twig, and the first account of this practice was in 1568.\nSir William F. Barrett wrote in his 1911 book \"Psychical Research\" that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...in a recent admirable Life of St. Teresa of Spain, the following incident is narrated: Teresa in 1568 was offered the site for a convent to which there was only one objection, there was no water supply; happily, a Friar Antonio came up with a twig in his hand, stopped at a certain spot and appeared to be making the sign of the cross; but Teresa says, \"Really I cannot be sure if it were the sign he made, at any rate he made some movement with the twig and then he said, ' Dig just here '; they dug, and lo ! a plentiful fount of water gushed forth, excellent for 'drinking, copious for washing, and it never ran dry.' \" As the writer of this Life remarks: \"Teresa, not having heard of dowsing, has no explanation for this event\", and regarded it as a miracle. This, I believe, is the first historical reference to dowsing for water.\nIn 1662, divining with rods was declared to be \"superstitious, or rather satanic\" by a Jesuit, Gaspar Schott, though he later noted that he was not sure that the devil was always responsible for the movement of the rod. In southern France in the 17th century, it was used to track criminals and heretics. Its abuse led to a decree of the inquisition in 1701, forbidding its employment for purposes of justice.\nAn epigram by Samuel Sheppard, from \"Epigrams theological, philosophical, and romantick\" (1651) runs thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nModern dowsing.\nDowsing practices used in an attempt to locate metals are still performed much like they were during the 16th century. The 1550 edition of Sebastian M\u00fcnster's \"Cosmographia\" contains a woodcut of a dowser with forked rod in hand walking over a cutaway image of a mining operation. The rod is labeled in Latin and German; \" \"\u2013\" \" ('Rod Divine, Luck-Rod'), but there is no text accompanying the woodcut. By 1556, Georgius Agricola's treatment of mining and smelting of ore, \"De Re Metallica\", included a detailed description of dowsing for metal ore.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the 16th century, German deep mining technology was in enormous demand all over Europe. German miners were licensed to live and work in England; particularly in the Stannaries (tin mines) of Devon and Cornwall and in Cumbria. In other parts of England, the technique was used in the royal mines for calamine. By 1638 German miners were recorded using the technique in silver mines in Wales.\nThe Middle Low German name for a forked stick (Y-rod) was ('striking rod'). This was translated in the sixteenth century Cornish dialect to ( according to William Barrett) (Middle English, 'to strike, fall'). By the seventeenth century the English term \"dowsing\" was coming into common use.\nIn the lead-mining area of the Mendip Hills in Somerset, England in the 17th century the natural philosopher Robert Boyle, inspired by the writings of Agricola, watched a practitioner try to find \"latent veins of metals\". Boyle saw the hazel divining rod () stoop in the hands of the diviner, who protested that he was not applying any force to the twig; Boyle accepted the man's genuine belief but himself remained unconvinced. Towards the end of the century, in 1691 the philosopher John Locke, who was born in the English West Country, used the term \"deusing-rod\" for the Old Latin name . So, \"dowse\" is synonymous with \"strike\", hence the phrases: to \"dowse\"/\"strike\" a light, to \"dowse\"/\"strike\" a sail.\nDowsing was conducted in South Dakota in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to help homesteaders, farmers and ranchers locate water wells on their property.\nThe military have occasionally resorted to dowsing techniques. In the First World War Gallipoli campaign, sapper Stephen Kelly, of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, Australian Expeditionary Force, became well known for finding water for the British troops. In the late 1960s during the Vietnam War, some United States Marines used dowsing when locating weapons and tunnels. As late as in 1986, when 31 soldiers were taken by an avalanche during an operation in the NATO drill Anchor Express in Vassdalen, Norway, the Norwegian army attempted to locate soldiers buried in the avalanche using dowsing as a search method.\nDowsing is still used by some farmers and water engineers in Britain; however, many of the country's utilities have distanced themselves from the practice.\nPostulated mechanisms.\nEarly attempts at an explanation of dowsing were based on the notion that the divining rod was physically affected by emanations from substances of interest. The following explanation is from William Pryce's 1778 \"Mineralogia Cornubiensis\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The corpuscles... that rise from the Minerals, entering the rod, determine it to bow down, in order to render it parallel to the vertical lines which the effluvia describe in their rise. In effect the Mineral particles seem to be emitted from the earth; now the Virgula [rod], being of a light porous wood, gives an easy passage to these particles, which are also very fine and subtle; the effluvia then driven forwards by those that follow them, and pressed at the same time by the atmosphere incumbent on them, are forced to enter the little interstices between the fibres of the wood, and by that effort they oblige it to incline, or dip down perpendicularly, to become parallel with the little columns which those vapours form in their rise.\nA study towards the end of the 19th century concluded that the phenomenon was attributed to cryptesthesia, where the practitioner makes unconscious observations of the terrain and involuntarily influences the movement of the rod. Early investigations by members of the Society for Psychical Research endorsed this view.\nCommitted parapsychologist G. N. M. Tyrrell also believed that the action of the rod was caused by involuntary muscular movements and debunked the theory of external influences.\nDowsing over maps, prior to visiting the site, was also believed to work, hence some kind of clairvoyance was proposed. This was believed to act on the nervous system, rather than on the muscles directly. These various mechanisms remain in contention among dowsers.\nFraudulent security devices.\nIn the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, a number of dowsing-like devices were marketed for modern police and military use, primarily as explosive detectors, such as the ADE 651, Sniffex, and the GT200. In consequence of these frauds, in 1999 the United States National Institute of Justice issued advice against buying equipment based on dowsing.\nEquipment.\nThe device used by a dowser is typically referred to as a dowsing or divining rod, even though it may not be rod-shaped.\nDowsing twig.\nTraditionally, the most common method used is the dowsing twig, a forked (Y-shaped) branch from a tree or bush. Some dowsers prefer branches from particular trees, and some prefer the branches to be freshly cut. Hazel twigs in Europe and witch-hazel in the United States are traditionally commonly chosen, as are branches from willow or peach trees. The two ends on the forked side are held one in each hand with the third (the stem of the Y) pointing straight ahead. The dowser then walks slowly over the places where the target (for example, minerals or water) may be, and the dowsing rod is expected to dip, incline or twitch when a discovery is made. This method is sometimes known as \"willow witching.\" Some dowsers would hang a golden ring on the edge of the dowsing rod, or split the tip to slide in a silver coin.\nPair of rods.\nMany modern dowsers use a pair of L-shaped metal rods. One rod is held in each hand, with the short arm of the L held upright, and the long arm pointing forward. The upright arm is often free to rotate inside a tube. When something is \"found,\" the rods move in synchrony. Depending on the dowser, they may cross over or swing apart. If the object is long and straight, such as a water pipe, the rods may point in opposite directions, showing its orientation. The rods may be fashioned from wire coat hangers or wire flags used for locating utilities. Glass or plastic rods have also been accepted. Straight rods are also sometimes used for the same purposes, and were common in early 19th century New England.\nPendulum.\nA pendulum weight on a short cord or thread is the tool of choice for many modern dowsers. The dowser holds the cord in one hand and allows the pendulum to swing freely. The dowser then observes how the pendulum is swinging and interprets the motion to offer insights.\nStudies.\nKassel 1991 study.\nA 1990 double-blind study was undertaken in Kassel, Germany, under the direction of the \"Gesellschaft zur Wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Parawissenschaften\" (Society for the Scientific Investigation of the Parasciences). James Randi offered a US$10,000 prize to any successful dowser. The three-day test of some thirty dowsers involved plastic pipes through which water flow could be controlled and directed. The pipes were buried under a level field, the position of each marked on the surface with a colored strip. The dowsers had to tell whether water was running through each pipe. All the dowsers signed a statement agreeing this was a fair test of their abilities and that they expected a 100% success rate. However, the results were no better than chance, and no one was awarded the prize.\nBetz 1990 study.\nIn a 1987\u201388 study in Munich by Hans-Dieter Betz and other scientists, 500 dowsers were initially tested for their skill, and the experimenters selected the best 43 among them for further tests. Water was pumped through a pipe on the ground floor of a two-story barn. Before each test, the pipe was moved in a direction perpendicular to the water flow. On the upper floor, each dowser was asked to determine the position of the pipe. Over two years, the dowsers performed 843 such tests and, of the 43 pre-selected and extensively tested candidates, at least 37 showed no dowsing ability. The results from the remaining 6 were said to be better than chance, resulting in the experimenters' conclusion that some dowsers \"in particular tasks, showed an extraordinarily high rate of success, which can scarcely if at all be explained as due to chance\u00a0\u2026 a real core of dowser-phenomena can be regarded as empirically proven.\"\nFive years after the Munich study was published, Jim T. Enright, a professor of physiology who emphasized correct data analysis procedure, contended that the study's results are merely consistent with statistical fluctuations and not significant. He believed the experiments provided \"the most convincing disproof imaginable that dowsers can do what they claim\", stating that the data analysis was \"special, unconventional and customized\". Replacing it with \"more ordinary analyses\", he noted that the \"best\" dowser was on average out of closer to a mid-line guess, an advantage of 0.04%, and that the five other \"good\" dowsers were on average farther than a mid-line guess. Enright emphasized that the experimenters should have decided beforehand how to statistically analyze the results; if they only afterward chose the statistical analysis that showed the greatest success, then their conclusions would not be valid until replicated by another test analyzed by the same method. He further pointed out that the six \"good\" dowsers did not perform any better than chance in separate tests. Another study published in \"Pathophysiology\" hypothesized that such experiments as this one that were carried out in the twentieth century could have been interfered with by man-made radio frequency radiation, as test subjects' bodies absorbed the radio waves and unconscious hand movement reactions took place following the standing waves or intensity variations.\nScientific reception.\nIdeomotor phenomenon.\nScience writers such as William Benjamin Carpenter (1877), Millais Culpin (1920), and Martin Gardner (1957) accept the view of some dowsers that the movement of dowsing rods is the result of unconscious muscular action. This view is widely accepted amongst the scientific community. The dowsing apparatus is known to amplify slight movements of the hands caused by a phenomenon known as the ideomotor response: people's subconscious minds may influence their bodies without consciously deciding to take action. This would make the dowsing rod susceptible to the dowsers' subconscious knowledge or perception; and also to confirmation bias.\nPseudoscience.\nDowsing is considered to be a pseudoscience.\nPsychologist David Marks in a 1986 article in \"Nature\" included dowsing in a list of \"effects which until recently were claimed to be paranormal but which can now be explained from within orthodox science.\" Specifically, dowsing could be explained in terms of sensory cues, expectancy effects, and probability.\nScience writer Peter Daempfle has noted that when dowsing is subjected to scientific testing, it fails. Daempfle has written that although some dowsers claim success, this can be attributed to the underground water table being distributed relatively uniformly in certain areas.\nAccording to archaeologist Kenneth Feder, \"the vast majority of archaeologists don't use dowsing, because they don't believe it works.\"\nPsychologist Chris French has noted that \"dowsing does not work when it is tested under properly controlled conditions that rule out the use of other cues to indicate target location.\"\nWater dowsers often achieve good results because random chance has a high probability of finding water in favorable terrain.\nIn Pop Culture.\nDowsing rods have appeared in many forms of popular media, such as Coraline and Pok\u00e9mon. It is often associated with ghostly or creepy themes and stories with superstitious elements. Other elements of popular media that reference dowsing rods include use of a dowsing pendulum by Professor Calculus in \"Tintin\"\",\" appearing as a card in \"\"\",\" and appearing as a plot device multiple times in \"The Smurfs (1981).\"\nNotable dowsers.\nNotable dowsers include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

He wrote the work after serving with the Queen's Own Rifles of Toronto in defence of Canada against Fenians invaders in the 1866 Battle of Ridgeway.\nHistory.\nMuir was said to have been inspired to write this song by a large maple tree which stood on his street in front of Maple Cottage, a house at Memory Lane and Laing Street in Toronto. The song became quite popular in English Canada and for many years served as an unofficial national anthem. Because of its strongly British perspective it was unpopular amongst French Canadians, and this prevented it from ever becoming an official state anthem, even though it was seriously considered for that role and was even used as a \"de facto\" state anthem in many instances.\nThe tree that inspired Muir's song fell during a windstorm on the night of July 19\u201320, 2013. Wood from the tree was used to make objects that will preserve its importance to Canadian culture, including the speaker's podium for Toronto City Council, and the Maple Leaf Forever Guitars. Residents have expressed their hope that the city will be able to start a new tree from one of the branches.\nDuring the early 1870s, Alexander Muir was an elementary school teacher in Newmarket, north of Toronto.\nIt has been asserted that Muir's words, however, while certainly pro-British, were not anti-French, and he revised the lyrics of the first verse from \"Here may it wave, our boast, our pride, and join in love together / The Thistle, Shamrock, Rose entwine\" to \"/ The Lily, Thistle, Shamrock, Rose, the Maple Leaf forever\"\u00a0\u2013 the thistle represents Scotland; the shamrock, Ireland; and the rose, England\u00a0\u2013 adding the French symbol, the \"lily\", to the list. By doing so, Muir asserted that the British and French were united as Canadians under the Union Flag.\n\"The Maple Leaf Forever\" is also the authorized regimental march of The Royal Westminster Regiment. Additionally, it is the regimental slow march of the Fort Henry Guard.\nThe song makes reference to James Wolfe capturing Quebec in 1759 during the Seven Years' War, and to the Battle of Queenston Heights and the Battle of Lundy's Lane during the War of 1812.\nLyrics.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nIn days of yore, from Britain's shore,\nWolfe, the dauntless hero, came\nAnd planted firm Britannia's flag\nOn Canada's fair domain.\nHere may it wave, our boast, our pride\nAnd, joined in love together,\nThe thistle, shamrock, rose entwine (Also sung: The lily, thistle, shamrock, rose)\nThe Maple Leaf forever!\n\"Chorus\"\n The Maple Leaf, our emblem dear,\n The Maple Leaf forever!\n God save our King and Heaven bless\n The Maple Leaf forever!\nAt Queenston Heights and Lundy's Lane,\nOur brave fathers, side by side,\nFor freedom, homes and loved ones dear,\nFirmly stood and nobly died;\nAnd those dear rights which they maintained,\nWe swear to yield them never!\nOur watchword evermore shall be\n\"The Maple Leaf forever!\"\n\"Chorus\"\nOur fair Dominion now extends\nFrom Cape Race to Nootka Sound;\nMay peace forever be our lot,\nAnd plenteous store abound:\nAnd may those ties of love be ours\nWhich discord cannot sever,\nAnd flourish green o'er freedom's home\nThe Maple Leaf forever!\n\"Chorus\"\nOn merry England's far famed land\nMay kind heaven sweetly smile,\nGod bless old Scotland evermore\nand Ireland's Em'rald Isle!\nAnd swell the song both loud and long\nTill rocks and forest quiver!\nGod save our King and Heaven bless\nThe Maple Leaf forever!\n\"Chorus\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nAlternative lyrics.\nCBC Radio's \"Metro Morning\" show in Toronto ran a contest to find new lyrics for the song in 1997. The contest was won by Romanian immigrant, mathematician, and now a songwriter, actor and poet, Vladimir Radian, who came to Canada in the 1980s. This version received its first full orchestral treatment on June 27, 1997, at a concert by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.\nThe new version removed all references to British-Canadian heritage, but added a special reference to Quebec's provincial symbol, the fleur-de-lis.\nPadre G. E. Benton, a former Canadian army chaplain, also wrote a revised version.\nThe Canadian vocal harmony trio \"Finest Kind\" (Ian Robb, Ann Downey and Shelley Posen) recorded \"The Maple Leaf Forever\" on their 2003 CD \"Silks &amp; Spices\". This version, with new words co-written by Posen and Robb and harmony arrangement by the trio, was sung at the ceremonial planting in Ottawa of two silver maple seedlings: direct descendants of the tree which is thought to have inspired Alexander Muir to write the original song in 1867. The ceremony occurred on November 2, 2014, and was attended by several local dignitaries and military veterans. The words acknowledge the Aboriginal, French, English and \"new Canadian\" contributions to the evolution of Canada, and highlight Canada's more recent military role as peacekeepers \"where hate and war divide\". The second verse also references John McCrae's iconic First World War poem \"In Flanders Fields\".\nMaple Leaf Gardens / Winter Olympics.\nDuring the final game of the Toronto Maple Leafs at their former home arena, Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Anne Murray sang another version (modified from Radian's version) of the \"Maple Leaf Forever\".

{"id": "54513", "revid": "27575635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54513", "title": "Opal", "text": "Hydrated amorphous form of silica\nOpal is a hydrated amorphous form of silica (SiO2\u00b7\"n\"H2O); its water content may range from 3% to 21% by weight, but is usually between 6% and 10%. Due to the amorphous (chemical) physical structure, it is classified as a mineraloid, unlike crystalline forms of silica, which are considered minerals. It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of rock, being most commonly found with limonite, sandstone, rhyolite, marl, and basalt.\nThe name \"opal\" is believed to be derived from the Sanskrit word (), which means 'jewel', and later the Greek derivative ().\nThere are two broad classes of opal: precious and common. Precious opal displays play-of-color (iridescence); common opal does not. Play-of-color is defined as \"a pseudo chromatic optical effect resulting in flashes of colored light from certain minerals, as they are turned in white light.\" The internal structure of precious opal causes it to diffract light, resulting in play-of-color. Depending on the conditions in which it formed, opal may be transparent, translucent, or opaque, and the background color may be white, black, or nearly any color of the visual spectrum. Black opal is considered the rarest, while white, gray, and green opals are the most common.\nPrecious opal.\nPrecious opal shows a variable interplay of internal colors, and though it is a mineraloid, it has an internal structure. At microscopic scales, precious opal is composed of silica spheres some in diameter in a hexagonal or cubic close-packed lattice. It was shown by J. V. Sanders in the mid-1960s that these ordered silica spheres produce the internal colors by causing the interference and diffraction of light passing through the microstructure of the opal. The regularity of the sizes and the packing of these spheres is a prime determinant of the quality of precious opal. Where the distance between the regularly packed planes of spheres is around half the wavelength of a component of visible light, the light of that wavelength may be subject to diffraction from the grating created by the stacked planes. The colors that are observed are determined by the spacing between the planes and the orientation of planes with respect to the incident light. The process can be described by Bragg's law of diffraction.\nVisible light cannot pass through large thicknesses of the opal. This is the basis of the optical band gap in a photonic crystal. In addition, microfractures may be filled with secondary silica and form thin lamellae inside the opal during its formation. The term \"opalescence\" is commonly used to describe this unique and beautiful phenomenon, which in gemology is termed \"play of color\". In gemology, opalescence is applied to the hazy-milky-turbid sheen of common or potch opal which does not show a play of color. Opalescence is a form of adularescence.\nFor use in jewellery, most opal is cut and polished to form a cabochon, a convex shape that maximises the viewing angles through which an opal's play of colour can be observed. \"Natural\" opal refers to polished stones consisting wholly of precious opal. Opals too thin to produce a \"natural\" opal may be combined with other materials to form \"composite\" gems. An opal doublet consists of a relatively thin layer of precious opal, backed by a layer of dark-colored material, most commonly ironstone, dark or black common opal (potch), onyx, or obsidian. The darker backing emphasizes the play of color and results in a more attractive display than a lighter potch. An opal triplet is similar to a doublet but has a third layer, a domed cap of clear quartz or plastic on the top. The cap takes a high polish and acts as a protective layer for the opal. The top layer also acts as a magnifier, to emphasize the play of color of the opal beneath, which is often an inferior specimen or an extremely thin section of precious opal. Triplet opals tend to have a more artificial appearance and are not classed as precious gemstones, but rather \"composite\" gemstones. Jewelry applications of precious opal can be somewhat limited by opal's sensitivity to heat due primarily to its relatively high water content and predisposition to scratching. Combined with modern techniques of polishing, a doublet opal can produce a similar effect to Natural black or boulder opal at a fraction of the price. Doublet opal also has the added benefit of having genuine opal as the top visible and touchable layer, unlike triplet opals.\nCommon opal.\nBesides the gemstone varieties that show a play of color, the other kinds of common opal include the milk opal, milky bluish to greenish (which can sometimes be of gemstone quality); resin opal, which is honey-yellow with a resinous luster; wood opal, which is caused by the replacement of the organic material in wood with opal; menilite, which is brown or grey; hyalite, a colorless glass-clear opal sometimes called Muller's glass; geyserite, also called siliceous sinter, deposited around hot springs or geysers; and diatomaceous earth, the accumulations of diatom shells or tests. Common opal often displays a hazy-milky-turbid sheen from within the stone. In gemology, this optical effect is strictly defined as opalescence which is a form of adularescence.\nVarieties of common opal.\n\"Girasol opal\" is a term sometimes mistakenly and improperly used to refer to fire opals, as well as a type of transparent to semitransparent type milky quartz from Madagascar which displays an asterism, or star effect when cut properly. However, the true girasol opal is a type of hyalite opal that exhibits a bluish glow or sheen that follows the light source around. It is not a play of color as seen in precious opal, but rather an effect from microscopic inclusions. It is also sometimes referred to as water opal, too, when it is from Mexico. The two most notable locations of this type of opal are Oregon and Mexico.\nA Peruvian opal (also called blue opal) is a semi-opaque to opaque blue-green stone found in Peru, which is often cut to include the matrix in the more opaque stones. It does not display a play of color. Blue opal also comes from Oregon and Idaho in the Owyhee region, as well as from Nevada around the Virgin Valley.\nOpal is also formed by diatoms. Diatoms are a form of algae that, when they die, often form layers at the bottoms of lakes, bays, or oceans. Their cell walls are made up of hydrated silicon dioxide which gives them structural coloration and therefore the appearance of tiny opals when viewed under a microscope. These cell walls or \"tests\" form the \"grains\" for the diatomaceous earth. This sedimentary rock is white, opaque, and chalky in texture. Diatomite has multiple industrial uses such as filtering or adsorbing since it has a fine particle size and very porous nature, and gardening to increase water absorption.\nHistory.\nOpal was rare and very valuable in antiquity. In Europe, it was a gem prized by royalty. Until the opening of vast deposits in Australia in the 19th century the only known source was beyond the Roman frontier in Slovakia. Opal is the national gemstone of Australia.\nSources.\nThe primary sources of opal are Australia and Ethiopia, but because of inconsistent and widely varying accountings of their respective levels of extraction, it is difficult to accurately state what proportion of the global supply of opal comes from either country.\nAustralian opal has been cited as accounting for 95\u201397% of the world's supply of precious opal, with the state of South Australia accounting for 80% of the world's supply. In 2012, Ethiopian opal production was estimated to be by the United States Geological Survey. USGS data from the same period (2012), reveals Australian opal production to be $41\u00a0million. Because of the units of measurement, it is not possible to directly compare Australian and Ethiopian opal production, but these data and others suggest that the traditional percentages given for Australian opal production may be overstated. Yet, the validity of data in the USGS report appears to conflict with that of Laurs et al. and Mesfin, who estimated the 2012 Ethiopian opal output (from Wegeltena) to be only .\nAustralia.\nThe town of Coober Pedy in South Australia is a major source of opal. The world's largest and most valuable gem opal \"Olympic Australis\" was found in August 1956 at the \"Eight Mile\" opal field in Coober Pedy. It weighs and is long, with a height of and a width of .\nThe Mintabie Opal Field in South Australia located about northwest of Coober Pedy has also produced large quantities of crystal opal and the rarer black opal. Over the years, it has been sold overseas incorrectly as Coober Pedy opal. The black opal is said to be some of the best examples found in Australia.\nAndamooka in South Australia is also a major producer of matrix opal, crystal opal, and black opal. Another Australian town, Lightning Ridge in New South Wales, is the main source of black opal, opal containing a predominantly dark background (dark gray to blue-black displaying the play of color), collected from the Griman Creek Formation. Boulder opal consists of concretions and fracture fillings in a dark siliceous ironstone matrix. It is found sporadically in western Queensland, from Kynuna in the north, to Yowah and Koroit in the south. Its largest quantities are found around Jundah and Quilpie in South West Queensland. Australia also has opalized fossil remains, including dinosaur bones in New South Wales and South Australia, and marine creatures in South Australia.\nEthiopia.\nThe first published report of gem opal from Ethiopia appeared in 1994, with the discovery of precious opal in the Menz Gishe District, North Shewa Province. The opal, found mostly in the form of nodules, was of volcanic origin and was found predominantly within weathered layers of rhyolite. This Shewa Province opal was mostly dark brown in color and had a tendency to crack. These qualities made it unpopular in the gem trade. In 2008, a new opal deposit was found approximately 180\u00a0km north of Shewa Province, near the town of Wegeltena, in Ethiopia's Wollo Province. The Wollo Province opal was different from the previous Ethiopian opal finds in that it more closely resembled the sedimentary opals of Australia and Brazil, with a light background and often vivid play-of-color. Wollo Province opal, more commonly referred to as \"Welo\" or \"Wello\" opal, has become the dominant Ethiopian opal in the gem trade.\nVirgin Valley, Nevada.\nThe Virgin Valley opal fields of Humboldt County in northern Nevada produce a wide variety of precious black, crystal, white, fire, and lemon opal. The black fire opal is the official gemstone of Nevada. Most of the precious opal is partial wood replacement. The precious opal is hosted and found \"in situ\" within a subsurface horizon or zone of bentonite, which is considered a \"lode\" deposit. Opals which have weathered out of the \"in situ\" deposits are alluvial and considered placer deposits. Miocene-age opalised teeth, bones, fish, and a snake head have been found. Some of the opal has high water content and may desiccate and crack when dried. The largest producing mines of Virgin Valley have been the famous Rainbow Ridge, Royal Peacock, Bonanza, Opal Queen, and WRT Stonetree/Black Beauty mines. The largest unpolished black opal in the Smithsonian Institution, known as the \"Roebling opal\", came out of the tunneled portion of the Rainbow Ridge Mine in 1917, and weighs . The largest polished black opal in the Smithsonian Institution comes from the Royal Peacock opal mine in the Virgin Valley, weighing , known as the \"Black Peacock\".\nMexico.\nFire opal is a transparent to translucent opal with warm body colors of yellow to orange to red. Although fire opals don't usually show any play of color, they occasionally exhibit bright green flashes. The most famous source of fire opals is the state of Quer\u00e9taro in Mexico; these opals are commonly called Mexican fire opals. Fire opals that do not show a play of color are sometimes referred to as jelly opals. Mexican opals are sometimes cut in their rhyolitic host material if it is hard enough to allow cutting and polishing. This type of Mexican opal is referred to as a Cantera opal. Another type of opal from Mexico, referred to as Mexican water opal, is a colorless opal that exhibits either a bluish or golden internal sheen.\nOpal occurs in significant quantity and variety in central Mexico, where mining and production first originated in the state of Quer\u00e9taro. In this region the opal deposits are located mainly in the mountain ranges of three municipalities: Col\u00f3n, Tequisquiapan, and Ezequiel Montes. During the 1960s through to the mid-1970s, the Quer\u00e9taro mines were heavily mined. Today's opal miners report that it was much easier to find quality opals with a lot of fire and play of color back then, whereas today the gem-quality opals are very hard to come by and command hundreds of US dollars or more. The orange-red background color is characteristic of all \"fire opals,\" including \"Mexican fire opal\".\nThe oldest mine in Quer\u00e9taro is Santa Maria del Iris. This mine was opened around 1870 and has been reopened at least 28 times since. At the moment there are about 100 mines in the regions around Quer\u00e9taro, but most of them are now closed. The best quality of opals came from the mine Santa Maria del Iris, followed by La Hacienda la Esperanza, Fuentezuelas, La Carbonera, and La Trinidad. Important deposits in the state of Jalisco were not discovered until the late 1950s.\nIn 1957, Alfonso Ramirez (of Quer\u00e9taro) accidentally discovered the first opal mine in Jalisco: La Unica, located on the outer area of the volcano of Tequila, near the Huitzicilapan farm in Magdalena. By 1960 there were around 500 known opal mines in this region alone. Other regions of the country that also produce opals (of lesser quality) are Guerrero, which produces an opaque opal similar to the opals from Australia (some of these opals are carefully treated with heat to improve their colors so high-quality opals from this area may be suspect). There are also some small opal mines in Morelos, Durango, Chihuahua, Baja California, Guanajuato, Puebla, Michoac\u00e1n, and Estado de M\u00e9xico.\nOther locations.\nAnother source of white base opal or creamy opal in the United States is Spencer, Idaho. A high percentage of the opal found there occurs in thin layers.\nOther significant deposits of precious opal around the world can be found in the Czech Republic, Canada, Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil (in Pedro II, Piau\u00ed), Honduras (more precisely in Erandique), Guatemala, and Nicaragua.\nIn late 2008, NASA announced the discovery of opal deposits on Mars.\nFossil opal.\nWood opal, also known as xylopal, is a form of opal, as well as a type of petrified wood which has developed an opalescent sheen or, more rarely, where the wood has been completely replaced by opal. \nOther names for this opalized sheen-like wood are opalized wood and opalized petrified wood. It is often used as a gemstone.\nSynthetic opal.\nOpals of all varieties have been synthesized experimentally and commercially. The discovery of the ordered sphere structure of precious opal led to its synthesis by Pierre Gilson in 1974. The resulting material is distinguishable from natural opal by its regularity; under magnification, the patches of color are seen to be arranged in a \"lizard skin\" or \"chicken wire\" pattern. Furthermore, synthetic opals do not fluoresce under ultraviolet light. Synthetics are also generally lower in density and are often highly porous.\nOpals which have been created in a laboratory are often termed \"lab-created opals\", which, while classifiable as man-made and synthetic, are very different from their resin-based counterparts which are also considered man-made and synthetic. The term \"synthetic\" implies that a stone has been created to be chemically and structurally indistinguishable from a genuine one, and genuine opal contains no resins or polymers. The finest modern lab-created opals do not exhibit the lizard skin or columnar patterning of earlier lab-created varieties, and their patterns are non-directional. They can still be distinguished from genuine opals, however, by their lack of inclusions and the absence of any surrounding non-opal matrix. While many genuine opals are cut and polished without a matrix, the presence of irregularities in their play-of-color continues to mark them as distinct from even the best lab-created synthetics.\nOther research in macroporous structures have yielded highly ordered materials that have similar optical properties to opals and have been used in cosmetics. Synthetic opals are also deeply investigated in photonics for sensing and light management purposes.\nLocal atomic structure.\nThe lattice of spheres of opal that cause interference with light is several hundred times larger than the fundamental structure of crystalline silica. As a mineraloid, no unit cell describes the structure of opal. Nevertheless, opals can be roughly divided into those that show no signs of crystalline order (amorphous opal) and those that show signs of the beginning of crystalline order, commonly termed cryptocrystalline or microcrystalline opal. Dehydration experiments and infrared spectroscopy have shown that most of the H2O in the formula of SiO2\u00b7\"n\"H2O of opals is present in the familiar form of clusters of molecular water. Isolated water molecules, and silanols, structures such as SiOH, generally form a lesser proportion of the total and can reside near the surface or in defects inside the opal.\nThe structure of low-pressure polymorphs of anhydrous silica consists of frameworks of fully corner bonded tetrahedra of SiO4. The higher temperature polymorphs of silica cristobalite and tridymite are frequently the first to crystallize from amorphous anhydrous silica, and the local structures of microcrystalline opals also appear to be closer to that of cristobalite and tridymite than to quartz. The structures of tridymite and cristobalite are closely related and can be described as hexagonal and cubic close-packed layers. It is therefore possible to have intermediate structures in which the layers are not regularly stacked.\nMicrocrystalline opal.\nMicrocrystalline opal or \"Opal-CT\" has been interpreted as consisting of clusters of stacked cristobalite and tridymite over very short length scales. The spheres of opal in microcrystalline opal are themselves made up of tiny nanocrystalline blades of cristobalite and tridymite. Microcrystalline opal has occasionally been further subdivided in the literature. Water content may be as high as 10\u00a0wt%. Opal-CT, also called \"lussatine\" or \"lussatite\", is interpreted as consisting of localized order of \u03b1-cristobalite with a lot of stacking disorder. Typical water content is about 1.5\u00a0wt%.\nNoncrystalline opal.\nTwo broad categories of noncrystalline opals, sometimes just referred to as \"opal-A\" (\"A\" stands for \"amorphous\"), have been proposed. The first of these is opal-AG consisting of aggregated spheres of silica, with water filling the space in between. Precious opal and potch opal are generally varieties of this, the difference being in the regularity of the sizes of the spheres and their packing. The second \"opal-A\" is opal-AN or water-containing amorphous silica-glass. Hyalite is another name for this.\nNoncrystalline silica in siliceous sediments is reported to gradually transform to opal-CT and then opal-C as a result of diagenesis, due to the increasing overburden pressure in sedimentary rocks, as some of the stacking disorder is removed.\nOpal surface chemical groups.\nThe surface of opal in contact with water is covered by siloxane bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and silanol groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH). This makes the opal surface very hydrophilic and capable of forming numerous hydrogen bonds.\nEtymology.\nThe word 'opal' is adapted from the Latin term . The origin of this word in turn is a matter of debate, but most modern references suggest it is adapted from the Sanskrit word meaning \u2018precious stone\u2019.\nAs references to the gem are made by Pliny the Elder, one theory attributed the name's origin to Roman mythology: to have been adapted from Ops, the wife of Saturn, and goddess of fertility. (The portion of Saturnalia devoted to Ops was \"Opalia\", similar to .)\nAnother common claim was that the term was adapted from the Ancient Greek word, . This word has two meanings, one is related to \"seeing\" and forms the basis of the English words like \"opaque\"; the other is \"other\" as in \"alias\" and \"alter\". It is claimed that combined these uses, meaning \"to see a change in color\". However, historians have noted the first appearances of do not occur until after the Romans had taken over the Greek states in 180\u00a0BC and they had previously used the term .\nHowever, the argument for the Sanskrit origin is strong. The term first appears in Roman references around 250\u00a0BC, at a time when the opal was valued above all other gems. The opals were supplied by traders from the Bosporus, who claimed the gems were being supplied from India. Before this, the stone was referred to by a variety of names, but these fell from use after 250\u00a0BC.\nHistorical superstitions.\nIn the Middle Ages, opal was considered a stone that could provide great luck because it was believed to possess all the virtues of each gemstone whose color was represented in the color spectrum of the opal. It was also said to grant invisibility. As a result, the opal was seen as the patron gemstone for thieves during the medieval period. Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott's \"Anne of Geierstein\" in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death. Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.\nEven as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, it was believed that when a Russian saw an opal among other goods offered for sale, he or she should not buy anything more, as the opal was believed to embody the evil eye.\nOpal is considered the birthstone for people born in October.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was also a noted public intellectual.\nHer 1979 book \"The Drama of the Gifted Child\" caused a sensation and became an international bestseller upon the English publication in 1981. Her views on the consequences of child abuse became highly influential in the fields of child development, psychotherapy, and trauma. In her books she departed from psychoanalysis, charging it with being similar to the poisonous pedagogies. \nMiller systemically critiqued Freudian concepts like the Oedipus complex as an attempt to reinterpret or obscure the reality of child abuse. Core to Miller's writings was that the suppression of childhood truths (which perpetuates the psychological groundwork for violence, authoritarianism, war, mental illness, and systemic cruelty) is both a crime against humanity and a universal and enduring taboo against the true self, by privileging the authority of parents, tradition, religion, morality, or society over the needs of children.\nIn a New York Times obituary, British psychologist Oliver James is quoted saying that Alice Miller \"is almost as influential as R.D. Laing.\"\nLife.\nAlicja Englard was born in Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski, Poland into an affluent Orthodox Jewish family. She was the oldest daughter of Gutta and Meylech Englard. Her younger sister, Irena, was born five years later. From 1931 to 1933 the family lived in Berlin, where nine-year-old Alicja learned the German language. Due to the National Socialists' seizure of power in Germany in 1933, the family was forced to return to Trybunalski. Shortly after the start of World War II, in October 1939 the Nazis interned all Jewish Trybunalski inhabitants (including Miller and her family) at the Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski Ghetto, when Miller was sixteen years old. Miller quickly began planning her escape and assumed a non-Yiddish name, Alice Rostowska. Miller eventually succeeded in smuggling herself, her mother, and her sister out of the ghetto, but was forced to leave her father behind as he spoke only Yiddish and had little chance of passing as a non-Jew in Nazi-occupied Poland. In 1941, her father died of illness in the ghetto, months before all remaining inhabitants (including Miller's paternal grandparents) were liquidated to the Majdanek and Treblinka extermination camps.\nAfter escaping the ghetto, Miller hid her mother and sister in a Catholic convent in Warsaw where, against the protests of her mother, Miller arranged for her sister to be baptized to ensure the family would not be outed as Jews. Upon urging from Miller's mother, Miller responded to an ad for an apartment, which unbeknownst to the family was posted by a szmalcownik (an undercover Gestapo informant who blackmailed Jews by threatening to expose them to the Nazis) named Andrzej (Andreas) Miller. Andreas threatened to out Miller, and, according to Martin Miller's 2013 biography of his mother, The True \"Drama of the Gifted Child\", Miller narrowly escaped certain death by seducing and later marrying Andreas, a fact that Miller would keep secret for the remainder of her life.\nIn 1946, Miller (under her assumed name Alice Rostowska) and Andreas moved from Poland to Switzerland, where the couple had won scholarships to study at the University of Basel.\nIn 1949, she married Andreas, who was completing a doctorate in sociology. They had two children, Martin (born 1950) and Julika (born 1956), who was born with Down's Syndrome. They divorced in 1973. Shortly after his mother's death, Martin stated in an interview with \"Der Spiegel\" and later in his book \"The True \"Drama of the Gifted Child\"\", that in the presence of his mother, he had been routinely beaten and sexually abused by Andreas, who was anti-semitic and authoritarian. Martin stated that his mother did not intervene in her son's abuse and was herself emotionally neglectful, experiences which Miller later drew upon to inform her subsequent theories on child abuse. Martin also mentioned that his mother was unable to share her wartime experiences with him, despite numerous lengthy conversations, and she was severely traumatized by them.\nIn 1953 Miller got her doctorate in philosophy, psychology and sociology. Between 1953 and 1960, Miller studied psychoanalysis and practiced it between 1960 and 1980 in Z\u00fcrich.\nIn 1980, after having worked as a psychoanalyst and an analyst trainer for 20 years, Miller \"stopped practicing and teaching psychoanalysis in order to explore childhood systematically.\" She became critical of both Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Her first three books originated from research she took upon herself as a response to what she felt were major blind spots in her field. However, by the time her fourth book was published, she no longer believed that psychoanalysis was viable in any respect.\nIn 1985 Miller wrote about the research from her time as a psychoanalyst: \"For twenty years I observed people denying their childhood traumas, idealising their parents and resisting the truth about their childhood by any means.\" In 1985 she left Switzerland and moved to Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence in Southern France.\nIn 1986, she was awarded the Janusz Korczak Literary Award for her book \"Thou Shalt Not Be Aware: Society's Betrayal of the Child\".\nIn April 1987 Miller announced in an interview with the German magazine \"Psychologie Heute\" (Psychology Today) her rejection of psychoanalysis. The following year she cancelled her memberships in both the Swiss Psychoanalytic Society and the International Psychoanalytic Association, because she felt that psychoanalytic theory and practice made it impossible for former victims of child abuse to recognise the violations inflicted on them and to resolve the consequences of the abuse, as they \"remained in the old tradition of blaming the child and protecting the parents\".\nOne of Miller's last books, \"Bilder meines Lebens\" (\"Pictures of My Life\"), was published in 2006. It is an informal autobiography in which the writer explores her emotional process from painful childhood, through the development of her theories and later insights, told via the display and discussion of 66 of her original paintings, painted in the years 1973\u20132005.\nBetween 2005 and her death in 2010, she answered hundreds of readers' letters on her website, where there are also published articles, flyers and interviews in three languages. Days before her death Alice Miller wrote: \"These letters will stay as an important witness also after my death under my copyright\".\nMiller died on 14 April 2010, at the age of 87, at her home in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence by means of assisted suicide after severe illness and diagnosis of advanced-stage pancreatic cancer.\nWork.\nMiller extended the trauma model to include all forms of child abuse and neglect, including those that are commonly accepted (such as spanking and leaving infants to cry to avoid \"spoiling\" a child), which she called \"poisonous pedagogy\", a non-literal translation of Katharina Rutschky's \"Schwarze P\u00e4dagogik\" (black or dark pedagogy/imprinting).\nDrawing upon the work of psychohistory, Miller analyzed writers Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka and others to find links between their childhood traumas and the course and outcome of their lives. Miller also analyzed the role of fiction, storytelling and fairy tales\u2014especially classic European stories\u2014as cultural artifacts that reflect deep psychological truths about childhood suffering that are passed down as unconscious expressions of real, often unspoken childhood experiences\u2014especially those involving mistreatment or abandonment by parents.\nThe introduction to the first chapter in Miller's first book, \"The Drama of the Gifted Child\", first published in 1979, contains a line that summarises her core view. In it, she writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Experience has taught us that we have only one enduring weapon in our struggle against mental illness: the emotional discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood.\nA common denominator in Miller's writings is her explanation of why human beings prefer not to know about their own victimisation during childhood: to avoid unbearable pain. She believed that the unconscious command of the individual, not to be aware of how they were treated in childhood, led to displacement: the irresistible drive to repeat abusive parenting in the next generation of children or direct unconsciously the unresolved trauma against others (war, terrorism, delinquency), or against themselves (eating disorders, drug addiction, depression).\nIn her writings, Miller is careful to clarify that by \"abuse\" she does not only mean physical violence or sexual abuse, but also psychological abuse and emotional neglect perpetrated by one or both parents on their child, which is difficult to for the abused person to identify and process because humans have an evolutionary drive to repress feelings of betrayal, rage, and self-protection so that they can continue to receive their parents' protection and acceptance. Formerly abused children are likely to repress feelings and memories of their childhood, which may be triggered by a stressful life event, or the onset of mental illness. Miller blamed psychologically neglectful or abusive parents for the majority of neuroses and psychoses. She maintained that all instances of mental illness, addiction, crime and cultism were ultimately caused by suppressed rage and pain as a result of subconscious childhood trauma that was not resolved emotionally, assisted by a helper, which she came to term an \"enlightened witness.\" In all cultures, \"sparing the parents is our supreme law,\" wrote Miller. Even psychiatrists, psychoanalysts and clinical psychologists were unconsciously afraid to blame parents for the mental disorders of their clients, she contended. According to Miller, mental health professionals were also creatures of the poisonous pedagogy internalized in their own childhood. This explained why the Commandment \"Honor thy parents\" was one of the main targets in Miller's school of psychology.\nMiller called electroconvulsive therapy \"a campaign against the act of remembering\". In her book \"Abbruch der Schweigemauer\" (The Demolition of Silence), she also criticized psychotherapists' advice to clients to forgive their abusive parents, arguing that this could only hinder recovery through remembering and feeling childhood pain. It was her contention that the majority of therapists fear this truth and that they work under the influence of interpretations culled from both Western and Oriental religions, which preach forgiveness by the once-mistreated child. She believed that forgiveness did not resolve hatred, but covered it in a dangerous way in the grown adult: displacement on scapegoats, as she discussed in her psycho-biographies of Adolf Hitler and J\u00fcrgen Bartsch, both of whom she described as having suffered severe parental abuse.\nIn the 1990s, Miller initially supported a version of primal therapy developed by Konrad Stettbacher. Miller initially learned of Stettbacher's method from a book by Mariella Mehr titled \"Steinzeit\" (Stone Age). Having been strongly impressed by the book, Miller contacted Mehr in order to get the name of the therapist. Later, Stettbacher was charged with incidents of sexual abuse. From that time forward, Miller refused to make therapist or method recommendations. In open letters to the public, Miller explained why she originally supported Stettbacher's methods, but in the end she distanced herself from him and his regressive therapies.\nThe roots of violence.\nAccording to Alice Miller, worldwide violence has its roots in the fact that children are beaten or emotionally neglected all over the world, especially during their first years of life as infants, when the human brain becomes structured in response to its environment. She said that the damage caused by these practices is devastating, but unfortunately hardly noticed by society. She argued that as children are forbidden to defend themselves against the violence inflicted on them, they must suppress the natural reactions like rage and fear, and they discharge these strong emotions later as adults against their own children or whole peoples: \"child abuse like beating and humiliating not only produces unhappy and confused children, not only destructive teenagers and abusive parents, but thus also a confused, irrationally functioning society\". Miller stated that only through becoming aware of this dynamic can we break the chain of violence.\nWritings.\nThe following is a brief summary of Miller's books.\n\"The Drama of the Gifted Child\".\nIn her first book (also published under the titles \"Prisoners of Childhood\" and \"The Drama of Being a Child\"), Miller defined and elaborated the personality manifestations of childhood trauma. She addressed the two reactions to the loss of love in childhood, depression and grandiosity; the inner prison, the vicious circle of contempt, repressed memories, the etiology of depression, and how childhood trauma manifests itself in the adult.\nMiller writes:\n\"Quite often I have been faced with patients who have been praised and admired for their talents and their achievements. According to prevailing, general attitudes these people\u2014the pride of their parents\u2014should have had a strong stable sense of self-assurance. But exactly the opposite is the case\u2026 In my work with these people, I found that every one of them has a childhood history that seems significant to me:\nThis ability is then extended and perfected. Later, these children not only become mothers (confidantes, advisers, supporters) of their own mothers, but also take over the responsibility for their siblings and eventually develop a special sensitivity to unconscious signals manifesting the needs of others.\"\n\"For Your Own Good\".\nMiller proposed here that German traumatic childrearing produced heroin addict Christiane F., serial killer of children J\u00fcrgen Bartsch, and dictator Adolf Hitler. Children learn to accept their parents' often abusive behaviour against themselves as being \"for their own good.\" In the case of Hitler, it led to displacement against the Jews and other minority groups. For Miller, the traditional pedagogic process of spanking was manipulative, resulting in grown-up adults deferring excessively to authorities, even to tyrannical leaders or dictators, like Hitler. Miller even argued for abandoning the term \"pedagogy\" in favour of the word \"support,\" something akin to what psychohistorians call the helping mode of parenting.\nIn the Poisonous Pedagogy section of the book, Miller does a thorough survey of 19th century child-rearing literature in the book, citing texts which recommend practices such as exposing children to dead bodies in order to teach them about the sexual functions of human anatomy (45\u201346), resisting the temptation to comfort screaming infants (41\u201343), and beating children who haven't committed any specific offense as a kind of conditioning that would help them to understand their own evil and fallen nature.\nThe key element that Miller elucidated in this book was the understanding of why the German nation, the \"good Germans,\" were compliant with Hitler's abusive regime, which Miller asserted was a direct result of how the society in general treated its children. She raised fundamental questions about current, worldwide child-rearing practices and issued a stern warning.\n\"Thou Shalt Not Be Aware\".\nUnlike Miller's later books, this one is written in a semi-academic style. It was her first critique of psychoanalysis, charging it with being similar to the poisonous pedagogies, which she described in \"For Your Own Good\". Miller was critical of both Freud and Carl Jung. She scrutinised Freud's drive theory, a device that, according to her and Jeffrey Masson, blames the child for the abusive sexual behaviour of adults. Miller also theorised about Franz Kafka, who was abused by his father but fulfilled the politically correct function of mirroring abuse in metaphorical novels, instead of exposing it.\nIn the chapter entitled \"The Pain of Separation and Autonomy,\" Miller examined the authoritarian (e.g.: Old Testament, Papist, Calvinist) interpretation of Judeo-Christian theism and its parallels to modern parenting practice, asserting that it was Jesus's father Joseph who should be credited with Jesus's departure from the dogmatic Judaism of his time.\n\"Pictures of Childhood\" \nThe Untouched Key \nThis book was partly a psychobiography of Nietzsche, Picasso, Kollwitz and Buster Keaton; (in Miller's later book, \"The Body Never Lies\", published in 2005, she included similar analyses of Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, Schiller, Rimbaud, Mishima, Proust and James Joyce).\nAccording to Miller, Nietzsche did not experience a loving family and his philosophical output was a metaphor of an unconscious drive against his family's oppressive theological tradition. She believed that the philosophical system was flawed because Nietzsche was unable to make emotional contact with the abused child inside him. Though Nietzsche was severely punished by a father who lost his mind when Nietzsche was a little boy, Miller did not accept the genetic theory of madness. She interpreted Nietzsche's psychotic breakdown as the result of a family tradition of Prussian modes of child-rearing.\n\"Banished Knowledge\".\nIn this more personal book Miller said that she herself was abused as a child. She also introduced the fundamental concept of \"enlightened witness\": a person who was willing to support a harmed individual, empathise with her and help her to gain understanding of her own biographical past.\n\"Banished Knowledge\" is autobiographical in another sense. It is a pointer in Miller's thoroughgoing apostasy from her own profession\u2014psychoanalysis. She believed society was colluding with Freud's theories in order to not know the truth about our childhood, a truth that human cultures have \"banished.\" She concluded that the feelings of guilt instilled in our minds since our most tender years reinforce our repression even in the psychoanalytic profession.\n\"Breaking Down the Wall of Silence\".\nWritten in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Miller took to task the entirety of human culture. What she called the \"wall of silence\" is the metaphorical wall behind which society \u2014 academia, psychiatrists, clergy, politicians and members of the media \u2014 has sought to protect itself: denying the mind-destroying effects of child abuse. She also continued the autobiographical confession initiated in \"Banished Knowledge\" about her abusive mother. In \"Pictures of a Childhood: Sixty-six Watercolours and an Essay\", Miller said that painting helped her to ponder deeply into her memories. In some of her paintings, Miller depicted baby Alice as swaddled, sometimes by an evil mother.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I betrayed that little girl [\u2026]. Only in recent years, with the help of therapy, which enabled me to lift the veil on this repression bit by bit, could I allow myself to experience the pain and desperation, the powerlessness and justified fury of that abused child. Only then did the dimensions of this crime against the child I once was, become clear to me.\nIn popular culture.\nAfter his mother's death, Miller's son Martin Miller published a memoir titled \"The True \"Drama of the Gifted Child\"\" (2013, translated to English in 2018) where he offers a personal account of his mother\u2019s life, examining the discrepancy between her public advocacy for children and her private behavior as a parent. While acknowledging his mother's groundbreaking role in exposing childhood trauma and the enduring legitimacy of her theories, he argues that she failed to apply her own insights within their family due to her unprocessed trauma during World War II and abusive marriage to a szmalcownik.\nIn 2020, a Swiss documentary titled \"Who is Afraid of Alice Miller?\" (Swiss: Wer hat Angst vor Alice Miller?) directed by Daniel Howald premiered at international film festivals and on European television. The film explores the life and legacy of Alice Miller through the perspective of her son, Martin Miller. The documentary was nominated for the Prix de Soleure (Jury Award) at the Solothurn Film Festival.\nBibliography.\nMiller's published books in English:\nIn popular culture:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His book \"Baby and Child Care\" (1946) is one of the best-selling books of the 20th century, selling 500,000 copies in the six months after its initial publication and 50 million by the time of Spock's death in 1998. The book's premise told mothers, \"You know more than you think you do.\" Dr. Spock was widely regarded as a trusted source for parenting advice in his generation.\nSpock was the first pediatrician to study psychoanalysis in an effort to understand children's needs and family dynamics. His ideas influenced several generations of parents, encouraging them to be more flexible and affectionate with their children and to treat them as individuals. However, his theories were widely criticized by colleagues for relying heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than serious academic research.\nAfter undergoing a self-described \"conversion to socialism\", Spock became an activist in the New Left and anti-Vietnam War movements during the 1960s and early 1970s, culminating in his run for President of the United States as the People's Party nominee in 1972. He campaigned on a maximum wage, legalized abortion, and withdrawing troops from all foreign countries. His books were criticized by conservatives for propagating permissiveness and an expectation of instant gratification, a charge that Spock denied.\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nBenjamin McLane Spock was born May 2, 1903, in New Haven, Connecticut. His parents were Benjamin Ives Spock, Yale graduate and long-time general counsel of the New Haven Railroad, and Mildred Louise (Stoughton) Spock. The family name had Dutch origins; they originally spelled it \"Spaak\" before migrating to the former colony of New Netherland. Spock was one of six children, including his younger sister, environmentalist writer Marjorie Spock.\nSpock attended Hamden Hall Country Day School, and went on to attend his father's alma maters Phillips Andover Academy and Yale University. He studied literature and history at Yale; the lanky 6' 4\" Spock was also active in college rowing. Eventually, he joined the Olympic rowing crew (Men's Eights) that won a gold medal at the 1924 games in Paris. At Yale, he was inducted into the Eta chapter of the Zeta Psi fraternity and the senior society Scroll and Key. He attended the Yale School of Medicine for two years before shifting to Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, from which he graduated first in his class in 1929. By that time, he had married Jane Cheney.\nPersonal life.\nJane Cheney and Spock were married in 1927. Jane assisted Spock in the research and writing of \"Dr. Spock's Baby &amp; Child Care\", published in 1946 by Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce as \"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care.\" The book has sold more than 50 million copies in 42 languages.\nJane Cheney Spock was a civil liberties advocate and mother of two sons. She was born in Manchester, Connecticut, and attended Bryn Mawr College. She was active in Americans for Democratic Action, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. The Spocks divorced in 1976. Cheney went on to organize and run support groups for older divorced women.\nIn 1976, Spock married Mary Morgan. They built a home on Beaver Lake in Arkansas where Spock would row daily. Mary quickly adapted to Spock's life of travel and political activism, and was arrested with him many times for civil disobedience. Once they were arrested in Washington, D.C. for praying on the White House lawn. Morgan was strip-searched; Spock was not. Morgan sued the jail and the mayor of Washington, D.C. for sex discrimination. The ACLU took the case and won.\nFor most of his life, Spock wore Brooks Brothers suits and shirts with detachable collars, but at 75, for the first time in his life, Mary got him to try blue jeans. She joined him in meditation twice a day and introduced him to Transactional analysis (TA) therapists, massage, yoga and a macrobiotic diet which reportedly improved his health. \"She gave me back my youth,\" Spock was quoted as saying. He adapted to her lifestyle, as she did to his. There were 40 years difference in their ages, but Spock would tell reporters they were both 16. Mary scheduled speaking dates and handled legal agreements for the 5th through 9th editions of \"Baby and Child Care\". She continues to publish the book with co-author Robert Needlman.\nFor many years, Spock lived aboard his sailboat, the \"Carapace,\" in the British Virgin Islands off Tortola. At 84, Spock won third place in a rowing contest, crossing four miles (6.4\u00a0km) of the Sir Francis Drake Channel between Tortola and Norman Island in 2.5 hours. He credited his strength and good health to his lifestyle and his love for life. Spock had a second sailboat, named \"Turtle\", in Maine on which he lived and sailed in the summer. The Spocks lived exclusively on boats for most of 20 years.\nBy 1991, Spock was unable to walk without assistance and was reported as infirm shortly before his death. At the very end of Spock's life, he was advised to come ashore by his physician, Steve Pauker, of New England Medical Center, Boston. In 1992, Spock received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library for his lifelong commitment to disarmament and peaceable child-rearing.\nSpock had two sons.\nSpock died at a house he was renting in La Jolla, California, on March 15, 1998. His ashes are buried in Rockport, Maine, where he spent his summers.\nBooks.\nIn 1946, Spock published \"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care\", which became a best-seller. Its message to parents is \"You know more than you think you do.\" By 1998, it had sold more than 50 million copies, and had been translated into 42 languages. According to the \"New York Times\", \"Baby and Child Care\" was, throughout its first 52 years, the second-best-selling book, next to the Bible. \nSpock advocated ideas about parenting that were considered out of the mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts (such as Truby King) had told parents babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them when they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to sleep through the night (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong, independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast, Spock encouraged parents to show affection for their children and to see them as individuals.\nBy the late 1960s, however, Spock's opposition to the Vietnam War had damaged his reputation. The 1968 edition of \"Baby and Child Care\" sold half as many copies of the prior edition. Later in life, Spock wrote \"Dr. Spock on Vietnam\" and co-wrote an autobiography entitled \"Spock on Spock\" (with wife Mary Morgan Spock), in which he stated his attitude toward aging: \"Delay and Deny\".\nIn the seventh edition of \"Baby and Child Care\" published shortly after he died, Spock advocated for a bold change in children's diets, recommending children switch to a vegan diet after age 2. Spock himself had switched to an all-plant diet in 1991 after a series of illnesses that left him weak and unable to walk unaided. After making the dietary change, he lost 50 pounds, regained his ability to walk and became healthier overall. The revised edition stated children on an all-plant diet will reduce their risk of developing heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain diet-related cancers. However, Spock's recommendations were criticized as being irresponsible towards children's health and children's ability to sustain normal growth, which has been aided with minerals such as calcium, riboflavin, vitamin D, iron, zinc and at times protein.\nSpock's approach to childhood nutrition was criticized by a number of experts, including co-author Boston pediatrician Steven J. Parker, as too extreme and likely to result in nutritional deficiencies unless it was carefully planned and executed, which would be difficult for working parents. T. Berry Brazelton, Boston City Hospital pediatrician who specialized in child behavior (and longtime admirer and friend of Dr. Spock), called the dietary recommendations \"absolutely insane.\" Neal Barnard, president of Physicians for Responsible Medicine, a Washington organization advocating strict vegetarian diets, acknowledged he drafted the nutrition section in the 1998 edition of \"Baby and Child Care,\" but said Spock edited it to give it \"his personal touch.\" It was acknowledged that in Spock's final years, he had strokes, bouts with pneumonia and a heart attack.\nViews.\nSudden infant death syndrome.\nSpock advocated that infants should not sleep on their backs, commenting in his 1958 edition that \"if [an infant] vomits, he's more likely to choke on the vomitus.\" This advice was extremely influential on healthcare providers, with nearly unanimous support through the 1990s. Later empirical studies, however, found a significantly increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) associated with infants sleeping on their abdomens. Advocates of evidence-based medicine have used this as an example of the importance of basing healthcare recommendations on statistical evidence. One researcher estimated that as many as 50,000 infant deaths in Europe, Australia, and the U.S. could have been prevented had this advice been changed by 1970 when such evidence became available.\nMale circumcision.\nIn the 1940s, Spock favored circumcision of males performed within a few days of birth. However, in the 1976 revision of \"Baby and Child Care\" he concurred with a 1971 American Academy of Pediatrics task force that there was no medical reason to recommend routine circumcision, and in a 1989 article for \"Redbook\" he stated that \"circumcision of males is traumatic, painful, and of questionable value.\" He received the first Human Rights Award from the International Symposium on Circumcision (ISC) in 1991 and was quoted as saying, \"My own preference, if I had the good fortune to have another son, would be to leave his little penis alone.\"\nSocial and political activism.\nIn 1962, Spock joined The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, otherwise known as SANE. Spock was politically outspoken and active in the movement to end the Vietnam War. In 1968, he and four others (including William Sloane Coffin, Marcus Raskin, Mitchell Goodman, and Michael Ferber) were singled out for prosecution by then Attorney General Ramsey Clark on charges of conspiracy to counsel, aid, and abet resistance to the draft. Spock and three of his alleged co-conspirators were convicted, although the five had never been in the same room together. His two-year prison sentence was never served; the case was appealed, and in 1969 a federal court set aside his conviction.\nIn 1967, Spock was pressed to run as Martin Luther King Jr.'s vice-presidential running mate at the National Conference for New Politics over Labor Day weekend in Chicago. In April of that year, Spock helped lead the largest anti-war protest to date, the Spring Mobilization Against the War. Spock wore a suit and held a sign that read \"Children are not born to burn.\"\nIn 1968, Spock signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War, and he later became a sponsor of the War Tax Resistance project, which practiced and advocated tax resistance as a form of anti-war protest. He was also arrested for his involvement in anti-war protests resulting from his signing of the anti-war manifesto \"A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority\" circulated by members of the radical intellectual collective RESIST. The individuals arrested during this incident came to be known as the Boston Five.\nIn 1968, the American Humanist Association named Spock Humanist of the Year. On 15 October 1969, Spock was a featured speaker at the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam march.\nIn 1970, Dr. Benjamin Spock was active in The New Party serving as Honorary co-chairman with Gore Vidal. In the 1972 United States presidential election, Spock was the People's Party candidate with a platform that called for free medical care; the repeal of \"victimless crime\" laws, including the legalization of abortion, homosexuality, and cannabis; a guaranteed minimum income for families; and for an end to American military interventionism and the immediate withdrawal of all American troops from foreign countries. In the 1970s and 1980s, Spock demonstrated and gave lectures against nuclear weapons and cuts in social welfare programs.\nIn 1972, Spock, Julius Hobson (his vice presidential candidate), Linda Jenness (Socialist Workers Party presidential candidate), and Socialist Workers Party vice presidential candidate Andrew Pulley wrote to Major General Bert A. David, commanding officer of Fort Dix, asking for permission to distribute campaign literature and to hold an election-related campaign meeting. On the basis of Fort Dix regulations 210-26 and 210\u201327, General David refused the request. Spock, Hobson, Jenness, Pulley, and others then filed a case that ultimately made its way to the United States Supreme Court (424 U.S. 828\u2014\"Greer, Commander, Fort Dix Military Reservation, et al., v. Spock et al.\"), which ruled against the plaintiffs.\nSpock was the People's Party and the Peace and Freedom Party nominee in 1976 for vice president as the running mate of Margaret Wright.\nConservative backlash.\nPreacher Norman Vincent Peale supported the Vietnam War and, in the late 1960s, criticized the anti-war movement and the perceived laxity of that era, blaming Dr. Spock's books: \"The U.S. was paying the price of two generations that followed the Dr. Spock baby plan of instant gratification of needs.\"\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Spock was also blamed for the disorderliness of young people, many of whose parents had been devotees of \"Baby and Child Care\". Vice President Spiro Agnew also blamed Spock for \"permissiveness\". These allegations were enthusiastically embraced by conservative adults, who viewed the rebellious youth of that era with disapproval, referring to them as \"the Spock generation\".\nSpock's supporters countered that these criticisms betrayed an ignorance of what Spock had actually written, and/or a political bias against Spock's left-wing political activities. Spock himself, in his autobiography, said he had never advocated permissiveness; also, the attacks and claims that he had ruined American youth only arose after his public opposition to the Vietnam War. He regarded these claims as ad hominem attacks, whose political motivation and nature were clear.\nSpock addressed these accusations in the first chapter of his 1994 book, \"Rebuilding American Family Values: A Better World for Our Children.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Permissive Label: A couple weeks after my indictment [for \"conspiracy to counsel, aid and abet resistance to the military draft\"], I was accused by Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, a well-known clergyman and author who supported the Vietnam War, of corrupting an entire generation. In a sermon widely reported in the press, Reverend Peale blamed \"me\" for all the lack of patriotism, lack of responsibility, and lack of discipline of the young people who opposed the war. All these failings, he said, were due to my having told their parents to give them \"instant gratification\" as babies. I was showered with blame in dozens of editorials and columns from primarily conservative newspapers all over the country heartily agreeing with Peale's assertions.\nMany parents have since stopped me on the street or in airports to thank me for helping them to raise fine children, and they've often added, \"I don't see any instant gratification in \"Baby and Child Care\"\". I say they're right\u2014I've always advised parents to give their children firm, clear leadership and to ask for cooperation and politeness in return. On the other hand, I've also received letters from conservative mothers saying, in effect, \"Thank God I've never used your horrible book. That's why my children take baths, wear clean clothes and get good grades.\"\nSince I received the first accusation 22 years after \"Baby and Child Care\" was originally published\u2014and since those who write about how harmful my book is invariably assure me they've never used it\u2014I think it's clear that the hostility is to my politics rather than my pediatric advice. And though I've been denying the accusation for 25 years, one of the first questions I get from many reporters and interviewers is, \"Dr. Spock, are you still permissive?\" You can't catch up with a false accusation.\nIn June 1992, Spock told Associated Press journalist David Beard there was a link between pediatrics and political activism: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;People have said, \"You've turned your back on pediatrics.\" I said, \"No. It took me until I was in my 60s to realize that politics was a part of pediatrics.\"\nConservatives also criticized Spock for being interested in the ideas of Sigmund Freud and John Dewey and his efforts to integrate their philosophies into the general population. Spock wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;John Dewey and Freud said that kids don't have to be disciplined into adulthood but can direct themselves toward adulthood by following their own will.\nOlympic success.\nSpock was part of the all-Yale Men's eight rowing team at the 1924 Summer Olympics, captained by James Rockefeller (later president of what would become Citigroup). Competing on the Seine, the team won the gold medal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The team was a member of the original version of the XFL, begun by Vince McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment and by NBC, a major television network in the United States. The team played its home games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in the spring of 2001. They were in the XFL's Western Division with the San Francisco Demons, the Memphis Maniax, and the Las Vegas Outlaws. The team had the league's best passing offense and was nicknamed \"L.A.X.\" as a pun on the IATA code for Los Angeles International Airport. They finished the season in 1st place with a 7\u20133 record and defeated the Chicago Enforcers in the Playoffs and the San Francisco Demons in the Million Dollar Game with a score of 38\u20136 to win the league's sole Championship.\nHistory.\nThe LA Xtreme were the sole champions of the original XFL because NBC dropped the XFL concept after the first season due to dismal ratings. Shortly after this, McMahon announced that the league would be dissolved. However, the Xtreme's quarterback, Tommy Maddox, subsequently caught on with the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League, later leading them into the playoffs in 2002 and winning a Super Bowl ring in 2005.

Johnson", "text": "President of the United States from 1963 to 1969\nLyndon Baines Johnson (; August 27, 1908\u00a0\u2013\u00a0January 22, 1973), also known as LBJ, was the 36th president of the United States, serving from 1963 to 1969. He became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, under whom he had served as the 37th vice president from 1961 to 1963. A Southern Democrat, Johnson previously represented Texas in Congress for over 23 years, first as a U.S. representative from 1937 to 1949, and then as a U.S. senator from 1949 to 1961.\nBorn in Stonewall, Texas, Johnson worked as a teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937. In 1948, he was controversially declared the winner in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate election in Texas before winning the general election. He became Senate majority whip in 1951, Senate Democratic leader in 1953 and majority leader in 1954. Senator Kennedy bested Johnson and his other rivals for the 1960 Democratic presidential nomination before surprising many by offering to make Johnson his vice presidential running mate. The Kennedy\u2013Johnson ticket won the general election. Vice President Johnson assumed the presidency in 1963, after President Kennedy was assassinated. The following year, Johnson won re election to the presidency in a landslide, winning the largest share of the popular vote for the Democratic Party in history, and the highest for any candidate since the advent of widespread popular elections in the 1820s.\nLyndon Johnson's Great Society was aimed at expanding civil rights, public broadcasting, access to health care, aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development, consumer protection, environmentalism, and public services. He sought to create better living conditions for low-income Americans by spearheading the war on poverty. As part of these efforts, Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which resulted in the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Johnson made the Apollo program a national priority; enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965 which established federally insured student loans; and signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which laid the groundwork for U.S. immigration policy today. Johnson's civil rights legacy was shaped by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Due to his domestic agenda, Johnson's presidency marked the peak of modern American liberalism in the 20th century. Johnson's foreign policy prioritized containment of communism, including in the ongoing Vietnam War.\nJohnson began his presidency with near-universal support, but his approval declined throughout his presidency as the public became frustrated with both the Vietnam War and domestic unrest, including race riots, increasing public skepticism with his reports and policies (coined the \"credibility gap\"), and increasing crime. Johnson initially sought to run for re-election in 1968; however, following disappointing results in the New Hampshire primary, he withdrew his candidacy. Johnson retired to his Texas ranch and kept a low public profile until he died in 1973. Public opinion and academic assessments of Johnson's legacy have fluctuated greatly. Historians and scholars rank Johnson in the upper tier for his accomplishments regarding domestic policy. His administration passed many major laws that made substantial changes in civil rights, health care, welfare, and education. Conversely, Johnson is heavily criticized for his foreign policy, namely escalating American involvement in the Vietnam War.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nLyndon Baines Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, near Stonewall, Texas, in a small farmhouse on the Pedernales River. He was the eldest of five children born to Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr. and Rebekah Baines. Johnson was not given a name until he was three months old, as his parents could not agree on a name that both liked. Finally, he was named after \"criminal lawyer\u2014a county lawyer\" W. C. Linden, who his father liked; his mother agreed on the condition of spelling it as Lyndon. Johnson had one brother, Sam Houston Johnson, and three sisters, Rebekah, Josefa, and Lucia. Through his mother, he was a great-grandson of Baptist clergyman George Washington Baines.\nJohnson's paternal grandfather, Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr., was raised Baptist and for a time was a member of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). In his later years, Samuel Sr. became a Christadelphian; Samuel Jr. also joined the Christadelphian Church toward the end of his life. Johnson was influenced in his positive attitude toward Jews by the religious beliefs that his family, especially his grandfather, had shared with him.\nJohnson grew up poor, with his father losing a great deal of money. Biographer Robert Caro described him as being raised \"in a land without electricity, where the soil was so rocky that it was hard to earn a living from it.\"\nIn school, Johnson was a talkative youth who was elected president of his 11th-grade class. He graduated in 1924 from Johnson City High School, where he participated in public speaking, debate, and baseball. At 15, Johnson was the youngest in his class. Pressured by his parents to attend college, he enrolled at a \"sub college\" of Southwest Texas State Teachers College (SWTSTC) in the summer of 1924, where students from unaccredited high schools could take the 12th-grade courses needed for admission to college. He left the school just weeks after his arrival and decided to move to California. He worked at his cousin's legal practice and in odd jobs before returning to Texas, where he worked as a day laborer.\nIn 1926, Johnson enrolled at SWTSTC. He worked his way through school, participated in debate and campus politics, and edited the school newspaper, \"The College Star\". The college years refined his skills of persuasion and political organization. For nine months, from 1928 to 1929, Johnson paused his studies to teach Mexican\u2013American children at the segregated Welhausen School in Cotulla, Texas, south of San Antonio. The job helped him to save money to complete his education, and he graduated in 1930 with a Bachelor of Science in history and his certificate of qualification as a high school teacher. He briefly taught at Pearsall High School in Pearsall, Texas before taking a position teaching public speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston.\nWhen he returned to San Marcos in 1965, after signing the Higher Education Act of 1965, Johnson reminisced:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor. And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American.\nEntry into politics.\nAfter Richard M. Kleberg won a 1931 special election to represent Texas in the United States House of Representatives, he appointed Johnson as his legislative secretary. This marked Johnson's formal introduction to politics. Johnson secured the position on the recommendation of his father and that of state senator Welly Hopkins, for whom Johnson had campaigned in 1930. Kleberg had little interest in the day-to-day duties of a Congressman, instead delegating them to Johnson. After Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 1932 U.S. presidential election, Johnson became a lifelong supporter of Roosevelt's New Deal. Johnson was elected speaker of the \"Little Congress\", a group of Congressional aides, where he cultivated Congressmen, newspapermen, and lobbyists. Johnson's friends soon included aides to President Roosevelt as well as fellow Texans such as vice president John Nance Garner and congressman Sam Rayburn.\nIn 1935, Johnson was hired as Texas state administrator of the National Youth Administration (NYA). The job allowed him to travel around Texas seeking financial sponsors for NYA construction projects. Within six months, 18,000 young Texans were working on roads, parks, schools, and other public buildings. He resigned two years later to run for Congress. A notoriously tough boss, Johnson often demanded long workdays and work on weekends. He was described by friends, fellow politicians, and historians as motivated by lust for power and control. As Caro observes, \"Johnson's ambition was uncommon\u00a0\u2013 in the degree to which it was unencumbered by even the slightest excess weight of ideology, of philosophy, of principles, of beliefs.\"\nU.S. House of Representatives (1937\u20131949).\nIn 1937, after the death of 13-term congressman James P. Buchanan, Johnson successfully campaigned in a special election for Texas's 10th congressional district, which included Austin and the surrounding Texas Hill Country. He ran on a New Deal platform and was effectively aided by his wife. He served as a U.S. Representative from April 10, 1937, to January 3, 1949. President Roosevelt found Johnson to be a political ally and conduit for information, particularly regarding the internal politics of Texas and the machinations of Vice President John Nance Garner and House Speaker Sam Rayburn. As a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, Johnson helped plan a huge naval air training base at Corpus Christi, Texas. He also helped establish shipbuilding sites at Houston and Orange, Texas; and a Navy Reserve station in Dallas.\nJohnson successfully sponsored many federal projects for his home district. One was a program that provided cheap electricity for farmers under the new Rural Electrification Administration (REA), and he secured approval to complete the hydroelectric Mansfield Dam on the Colorado River near Austin. He also sponsored projects that gave his Texas district soil conservation, public housing, lower railroad freight rates, and expanded credit for loans to farmers. He steered the projects towards contractors he knew, such as Herman and George Brown, who financed much of Johnson's future career.\nDuring this time Johnson maintained a hostile position towards civil rights legislation like almost all other Southern Democrat legislators; voting against anti-lynching legislation, anti-poll tax legislation and the Fair Employment Practice Committee.\n1941 U.S. Senate election.\nIn April 1941, U.S. Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas died, triggering a special election. Texas law allowed Johnson to run without giving up his House seat. The election had no primaries or runoff, forcing Johnson to compete against multiple Democrats, including Governor W. Lee \"Pappy\" O'Daniel.\nJohnson campaigned aggressively, emphasizing his ties to President Roosevelt, and initially appeared to be leading. However, after late returns came in, O'Daniel narrowly won by 1,311 votes. In \"The Path to Power\", Johnson biographer Robert Caro argues that the election results were manipulated in O'Daniel's favor by lobbyists from Texas' alcohol industry. O'Daniel was a staunch prohibitionist, and as Governor, he had proposed a bill preventing the sale of alcohol within ten miles of a military base; Caro notes how business interests feared the passing of this bill, as preparations for World War II had brought thousands of young soldiers into the region. To prevent the passing of this bill, lobbyists sought to elect O'Daniel to the Senate to place the \"wet\" lieutenant governor Coke Stevenson in the governorship, and hence rigged ballots in East Texas, swinging the election in O'Daniel's favor. Johnson ultimately lost by just 0.23% of the vote.\nThough defeated, Johnson retained his House seat and political network, including support from South Texas political boss George Berham Parr. When O'Daniel declined to seek re-election in 1948, Johnson prepared for another Senate run, this time carefully managing vote tallies. He would go on to win the 1948 Democratic primary by just 87 votes.\nActive military duty (1941\u20131942).\nJohnson was a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Two days after the attack, he requested an indefinite leave of absence and applied for active duty, making him one of the first members of Congress to volunteer for an active military role. \nJohnson was first ordered to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations to assess the production and manpower problems that were slowing the manufacture of ships and planes. In May 1942, he was appointed President Roosevelt's personal representative to the Navy and was sent on a survey mission of the Pacific theater of combat. Stationed in Australia and New Zealand, it was his duty to find the underreported problems facing U.S. troops in the Pacific and report this firsthand information to Roosevelt. \nOn June 9, 1942, Johnson received the Silver Star from General Douglas MacArthur for gallantry in action during an aerial combat mission over hostile positions in New Guinea. Though accounts differ, Johnson's aircraft, a B-26 bomber, reportedly turned back before reaching the target due to mechanical trouble. Johnson's biographer Robert Caro was quoted as saying \"I think that the weight of the evidence at this moment is that the plane was attacked by Zeroes and that he was cool under fire\", but also \"The fact is, LBJ never got within sight of Japanese forces. His combat experience was a myth.\" \nJohnson served in the Pacific through July 1942. He was released from his military active duty after President Roosevelt recalled all active duty legislators back to Washington, D.C. In addition to the Silver Star, Johnson received the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.\nU.S. Senate (1949\u20131961).\n1948 U.S. Senate election.\nIn 1948, Johnson again ran for the U.S. Senate and won the general election after being declared winner in a highly controversial Democratic Party primary election against the well-known former governor Coke Stevenson. Johnson drew crowds to fairgrounds with his rented Sikorsky S-51 helicopter, dubbed \"The Johnson City Windmill\". He raised money to flood the state with campaign circulars and won over conservatives by casting doubts on Stevenson's support for the Taft\u2013Hartley Act (curbing union power). Stevenson came in first in the primary but lacked a majority, so a runoff election was held; Johnson campaigned harder, while Stevenson's efforts slumped due to a lack of funds.\nThe runoff vote count, handled by the Democratic State Central Committee, took a week. Johnson was announced the winner by 87 votes out of 988,295, an extremely narrow margin. However, Johnson's victory was based on 200 \"patently fraudulent\" ballots reported six days after the election from Box 13 in Jim Wells County, in an area dominated by political boss George Parr. The added names were in alphabetical order and written with the same pen and handwriting, at the end of the list of voters. Some on this part of the list insisted that they had not voted that day. Election judge Luis Salas said in 1977 that he had certified 202 fraudulent ballots, 200 for Johnson, and two for Stevenson. Robert Caro made the case in his 1990 book that Johnson had stolen the election in Jim Wells County, and that there were thousands of fraudulent votes in other counties as well, including 10,000 votes switched in San Antonio. The Democratic State Central Committee voted to certify Johnson's nomination by a majority of one (29\u201328). The state Democratic convention upheld Johnson. Stevenson went to court, eventually taking his case before the U.S. Supreme Court, but with timely help from his friend and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, Johnson prevailed on the basis that jurisdiction over naming a nominee rested with the party, not the federal government. Johnson soundly defeated Republican Jack Porter in the general election in November and went to Washington, permanently dubbed \"Landslide Lyndon\". Johnson, dismissive of his critics, happily adopted the nickname.\nFreshman senator to majority whip.\nDuring his two terms in the Senate, Johnson drifted rightward. He felt he had to tread carefully lest he offend politically powerful conservative oil and gas interests in Texas, and in part to curry favor with the chamber's powerful southern chairmen, most notably Senator Richard Russell, Democrat from Georgia and leader of the Southern Caucus within the conservative coalition that dominated the Senate. With Russell's support, Johnson won election as Democratic whip in 1951, serving in this capacity until 1953. While serving as whip, Johnson increased his ability to persuade people to reach agreement.\nAs a member of the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Johnson was chairman of the Senate subcommittee that refused the re-nomination of Leland Olds\u2014who was opposed by Texas oil and gas interests\u2014as chairman of the Federal Power Commission (FPC) on the grounds that he had been sympathetic towards communism. As a member of the FPC, Olds had played a key role in the development of federal regulation of the natural gas industry.\nPresident Truman favored federal control of tidelands oil deposits off the Texas coast. Privately, Johnson told friends that he favored federal control, but in public he staunchly defended states' rights. In 1951\u201352, Johnson helped pass bills granting 47 states control over 3 miles of offshore lands and Texas, 10.5 miles. Truman vetoed the bills, calling them \"robbery in broad daylight\".\nJohnson was appointed to the Senate Armed Services Committee, and became increasingly concerned with the country's military preparedness in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. He became chairman of the Senate Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee, and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency. After the Korean War began in 1950, he called for more troops and for improved weapons. Biographer Caro wrote that Johnson was obsessed with having all subcommittee reports be unanimous, maneuvering frequently to gain the backing of all the Republicans. He used his political influence in the Senate to receive broadcast licenses from the Federal Communications Commission in his wife's name.\nSenate Democratic leader.\nIn the 1952 elections, Republicans won a majority in both the House and Senate. In January 1953, Johnson was chosen by his fellow Democrats as Senate Minority Leader; he became the most junior senator ever elected to this position. He reformed the seniority system so that Democratic senators, including freshmen, were more likely to receive a committee assignment that closely aligned with their expertise rather than an assignment based solely on their seniority.\nSenate Majority Leader.\nIn 1954, Johnson was re-elected to the Senate and, with Democrats winning the majority in the Senate, he became majority leader. President Dwight D. Eisenhower found Johnson more cooperative than the Senate Republican leader, William F. Knowland of California. Particularly on foreign policy, Johnson offered bipartisan support to the president.\nHistorians Caro and Dallek consider Johnson the most effective Senate majority leader ever. He was unusually proficient at gathering information. One biographer suggests he was \"the greatest intelligence gatherer Washington has ever known\", discovering exactly where every senator stood on issues, his philosophy and prejudices, his strengths and weaknesses, and what it took to get his vote. Bobby Baker claimed that Johnson would occasionally send senators on NATO trips so they were absent and unable to cast dissenting votes. Central to Johnson's control was \"The Treatment\", described by two journalists:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Treatment could last ten minutes or four hours. It came, enveloping its target, at the Johnson Ranch swimming pool, in one of Johnson's offices, in the Senate cloakroom, on the floor of the Senate itself\u00a0\u2013 wherever Johnson might find a fellow Senator within his reach.\nIts tone could be supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scorn, tears, complaint, and the hint of threat. It was all of these together. It ran the gamut of human emotions. Its velocity was breathtaking and it was all in one direction. Interjections from the target were rare. Johnson anticipated them before they could be spoken. He moved in close, his face a scant millimeter from his target, his eyes widening and narrowing, his eyebrows rising and falling. From his pockets poured clippings, memos, statistics. Mimicry, humor, and the genius of analogy made The Treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the target stunned and helpless.\nIn 1956, during the Suez Crisis, Johnson tried to prevent the U.S. government from criticizing Israel for its invasion of the Sinai Peninsula. Along with much of the rest of the nation, Johnson was appalled by the threat of possible Soviet domination of space exploration implied by the launch of \"Sputnik 1\", the first artificial Earth satellite, and used his influence to ensure passage of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which established NASA. Johnson helped establish the Senate Aeronautical and Space Committee, and made himself its first chairman.\nDuring his tenure as Majority Leader, Johnson did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and shepherded the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 to passage \u200d\u2014\u200c the first civil rights bills to pass Congress since the Enforcement Acts and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 during Reconstruction. Johnson negotiated a middle course between Northern liberal senators and the Southern bloc of senators who had opposed such legislation by removing key enforcement provisions, such as Title III, which authorized the attorney general to initiate civil action for preventive relief in a wide range of civil rights matters. Being a Southerner was seen as an impossible barrier for a presidential candidate and towards the end of his Senate career as well as not signing the Southern Manifesto, he distanced himself further from the Southern Caucus in 1959 by joining the Democrat's Western regional conference.\nCampaigns of 1960.\nIn 1960, Johnson's success in the Senate rendered him a potential Democratic presidential candidate. James H. Rowe repeatedly urged Johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959, but Johnson thought it was better to wait, thinking that Senator John F. Kennedy's candidacy would create a division in the ranks that could then be exploited. Johnson's strategy was to sit out the primaries and to rely on his legislative record as Senate Majority Leader, the support of Southern Democrats, and the favors owed by Democratic senators to him and by Democratic representatives to his close ally Sam Rayburn, the Speaker of the House.\nIn July 1960, Johnson finally entered the campaign. Johnson's late entry, coupled with his reluctance to leave Washington, D.C., allowed rival John F. Kennedy to secure a substantial early lead in securing support from Democratic state party officials. Johnson underestimated Kennedy's endearing charm and intelligence in comparison to his perceived crude and wheeling-dealing \"Landslide Lyndon\" style. Caro suggests that Johnson's hesitancy to enter the race resulted from his fear of losing.\nJohnson attempted in vain to capitalize on Kennedy's youth, poor health, and failure to take a position regarding McCarthyism. He had formed a \"Stop Kennedy\" coalition with Adlai Stevenson, Stuart Symington, and Hubert Humphrey, but it proved a failure. Despite Johnson having the support of established Democrats and the party leadership, this did not translate into popular approval. Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention to Kennedy's 806, and so the convention nominated Kennedy. Tip O'Neill was a representative from Kennedy's home state of Massachusetts at that time, and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said, \"Tip, I know you have to support Kennedy at the start, but I'd like to have you with me on the second ballot.\" O'Neill replied, \"Senator, there's not going to be any second ballot.\"\nVice presidential nomination.\nAfter much discussion with party leaders and others, Kennedy offered Johnson the vice presidential nomination at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel on July 14, the morning after Kennedy was nominated, and Johnson accepted. From that point to the actual nomination that evening, several facts are in dispute, including whether convention chairman LeRoy Collins' had the two-thirds majority required to begin the convention's proceedings. Kennedy's choice of Johnson as his running mate was intended to attract Southern votes. Kennedy was a liberal Bostonian and a Roman Catholic. Johnson was more conservative, a Southerner, and a member of the Disciples of Christ. Nevertheless, labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to Johnson. AFL-CIO president George Meany called Johnson \"the arch-foe of labor\", and Illinois AFL-CIO president Reuben Soderstrom asserted Kennedy had \"made chumps out of leaders of the American labor movement\".\nRe-election to U.S. Senate.\nAt the same time as his vice presidential run, Johnson also sought a third term in the U.S. Senate. According to Robert Caro: Johnson won an election for both the vice presidency of the United States, on the Kennedy\u2013Johnson ticket, and for a third term as senator (he had Texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices). When he won the vice presidency, he made arrangements to resign from the Senate, as he was required to do under federal law, as soon as it convened on January 3, 1961. Johnson was re-elected senator with 1,306,605 votes (58\u00a0percent) to Republican John Tower's 927,653 (41.1\u00a0percent). Fellow Democrat William A. Blakley was appointed to replace Johnson, but lost a special election in May 1961 to Tower.\nVice presidency (1961\u20131963).\nAfter the election, Johnson was concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office and sought authority not allotted to him as vice president. He initially sought a transfer of the authority of Senate majority leader to the vice presidency, since that office made him president of the Senate, but faced vehement opposition from the Democratic Caucus, including members whom he had counted as his supporters.\nJohnson sought to increase his influence within the executive branch. He drafted an executive order for Kennedy's signature, granting Johnson \"general supervision\" over matters of national security, and requiring all government agencies to \"cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments\". Kennedy's response was to sign a non-binding letter requesting Johnson to \"review\" national security policies instead. Kennedy similarly turned down early requests from Johnson to be given an office adjacent to the Oval Office and to employ a full-time staff within the White House. In 1961, Kennedy appointed Johnson's friend Sarah T. Hughes to a federal judgeship. Johnson tried but failed to have Hughes nominated at the beginning of his vice presidency. House Speaker Sam Rayburn wangled the appointment from Kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill.\nWith the exception of Kennedy himself, other members of the Kennedy White House were openly contemptuous of Johnson, including the president's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and they ridiculed his comparatively brusque and crude manner. Then Congressman Tip O'Neill recalled that the Kennedy staffers \"had a disdain for Johnson that they didn't even try to hide... They actually took pride in snubbing him.\"\nKennedy made efforts to keep Johnson busy and informed, telling aides, \"I can't afford to have my vice president, who knows every reporter in Washington, going around saying we're all screwed up, so we're going to keep him happy.\" Kennedy appointed him to jobs such as the head of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities, where Johnson worked with African Americans and other minorities. Kennedy may have intended this to remain a nominal position, but Taylor Branch contends in his book \"Pillar of Fire\" that Johnson pushed the Kennedy administration's actions further and faster for civil rights than Kennedy originally intended.\nJohnson went on multiple minor diplomatic missions, which gave him some insights into global issues and opportunities for self-promotion. During his visit to West Berlin on August 19\u201320, 1961, Johnson sought to calm Berliners who were outraged by the building of the Berlin Wall. He also attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings. Kennedy gave Johnson control over all presidential appointments involving Texas, and appointed him chairman of the President's Ad Hoc Committee for Science.\nKennedy also appointed Johnson Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The Soviets beat the United States with the first crewed spaceflight in April 1961, and Kennedy gave Johnson the task of evaluating the U.S. space program and recommending a project that would allow the United States to catch up or beat the Soviets. Johnson recommended that the United States gain the leadership role by committing to landing an American on the Moon in the 1960s. Kennedy assigned priority to the space program, but Johnson's appointment provided cover in case of a failure.\nIn August 1963, Johnson was touched by a Senate scandal when Bobby Baker, the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Johnson's, came under investigation by the Senate Rules Committee for alleged bribery and financial malfeasance. One witness alleged that Baker arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the Vice President. Baker resigned in October, and the investigation did not expand to Johnson. The negative publicity, however, fed rumors in Washington circles that Kennedy was planning on dropping Johnson from the Democratic ticket in the 1964 presidential election. However, on October 31, 1963, a reporter asked if he intended and expected to retain Johnson on the ticket. Kennedy replied, \"Yes to both those questions.\" There is little doubt that Robert Kennedy and Johnson hated each other, yet John and Robert Kennedy agreed that dropping Johnson from the ticket could produce heavy losses in the South.\nPresidency (1963\u20131969).\nSuccession.\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Later that day, Johnson took the presidential oath of office aboard \"Air Force One\". Cecil Stoughton's iconic photograph of Johnson taking the oath of office as Mrs. Kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft. Johnson was sworn in by District Court judge Sarah T. Hughes and is to date the only president in U.S. history to be sworn in by a woman.\nJohnson was convinced of the need to make an immediate show of transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation. He and the Secret Service, not knowing whether the assassin acted alone or as part of a broader conspiracy, felt compelled to return rapidly to Washington, D.C.; this was greeted by some with assertions that he was in too much haste to assume power. In response to the public demand for answers and the growing number of conspiracy theories, Johnson established a commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, known as the Warren Commission, to investigate Kennedy's assassination. The commission conducted research and hearings and unanimously concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination. Although Johnson publicly supported the findings of the Warren Commission, privately he expressed skepticism of its conclusions. In 1967 he told his advisor W. Marvin Watson that he was convinced the CIA was in some way involved in the assassination, and shortly before his death, he told his speechwriter Leo Janos \"I never believed that Oswald acted alone, although I can accept that he pulled the trigger\".\nWhen Johnson assumed office, he asked the existing Cabinet to remain in place. Despite his notoriously poor relationship with Johnson, Robert F. Kennedy stayed on as Attorney General until September 1964, when he resigned to run for the U.S. Senate. Four of the Kennedy cabinet members Johnson inherited\u2014Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman, and Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz\u2014served until the end of Johnson's presidency. Other Kennedy holdovers, including Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, left office during Johnson's tenure. Although Johnson had no official chief of staff, Walter Jenkins presided over daily operations at the White House. George Reedy, who was Johnson's second-longest-serving aide, assumed the post of press secretary when John F. Kennedy's own Pierre Salinger left that post in March 1964. Horace Busby served primarily as a speechwriter and political analyst. Bill Moyers handled scheduling and speechwriting part-time.\nTaxation and budget.\nThe new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy's primary legislative goals \u200d\u2014\u200c a tax cut. Johnson worked closely with Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below $100\u00a0billion in exchange for what became overwhelming Senate approval of the Revenue Act of 1964. The act cut individual income tax rates across the board by approximately 20 percent, cut the top marginal tax rate from 91 to 70 percent, and slightly reduced corporate tax rates. Passage of the long-stalled tax cut facilitated efforts to move ahead on civil rights legislation. Despite a period of strong economic growth, heavy spending on the Vietnam War and on domestic programs contributed to a rising budget deficit, as well as a period of inflation that would continue into the 1970s. To counter this, Johnson reluctantly signed a second tax bill, the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968, which included a mix of tax increases and spending cuts, producing a budget surplus.\nCivil Rights Act of 1964.\nOn November 27, 1963, Johnson delivered his \"Let Us Continue\" speech to Congress, saying that \"No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long.\" The wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to Johnson's promise to carry out Kennedy's plans.\nJohnson asked Robert Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking on Capitol Hill. This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail, but if it were successful, Johnson would receive ample credit. Biographer Caro notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past: Southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote. In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, to force the bill's supporters to pull it. For Johnson's civil rights bill to reach the House floor for a vote, the president needed to find a way to circumvent Representative Howard W. Smith, the chairman of the House Rules Committee. Johnson used a discharge petition to force it onto the House floor. Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed, the Rules Committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full House, which soon passed it by a vote of 290\u2013110. Johnson convinced Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield to put the House bill directly into consideration by the full Senate, bypassing the Senate Judiciary Committee and its segregationist chairman James Eastland. Since bottling up the civil rights bill in a committee was no longer an option, the anti-civil rights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool. Overcoming the filibuster required the support of at least 20 Republicans, who were growing less supportive because their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill. According to Caro, Johnson ultimately could convince Republican leader Everett Dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964; the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 71\u201329.\nJohnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on July 2. The act outlawed discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. It prohibited racial segregation in public accommodations and employment discrimination, and strengthened the federal government's power to investigate racial and gender employment discrimination. The following evening, Johnson told aide Bill Moyers, \"I think we may have lost the South for your lifetime \u2013 and mine\", anticipating a backlash from Southern whites against Johnson's Democratic Party.\nGreat Society.\nBy early 1964, Johnson had begun to use the name \"Great Society\" to describe his domestic program. Johnson's Great Society program encompassed movements of urban renewal, modern transportation, clean environment, anti-poverty, healthcare reform, crime control, and educational reform. To ensure the passage of his programs, Johnson placed an unprecedented emphasis on relations with Congress.\n1964 presidential election.\nIn Spring 1964, Johnson was not optimistic about his prospects of being elected president. A pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding. Johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike. After considerable horse-trading, especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances from the Internal Revenue Service, Johnson obtained an agreement. This substantially boosted his self-confidence and image.\nRobert F. Kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice for Johnson's vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy had never liked each other, and Johnson, afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, consistently opposed the idea. Kennedy was undecided about accepting an offer as Johnson's running mate, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson. Barry Goldwater's poor polling numbers was perceived as reducing the political significance of Johnson's selection of a running mate. Hubert Humphrey's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast. Knowing the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president, Johnson put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his loyalty. Having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.\nIn preparation for the Democratic convention in Atlantic City, Johnson requested the FBI send 30 agents to cover convention activities; the objective of the squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities. The squad's focus narrowed upon the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) delegation, which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state. The squad's activities included wiretaps of Martin Luther King's room and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). From beginning to end, the squad's assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other high-ranking officials.\nJohnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the MFDP and the segregationist delegation, and he assigned Humphrey to manage the problem. The convention's Credentials Committee declared that two MFDP delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to \"bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote because of their race or color\". The MFDP rejected the committee's ruling. The convention became the apparent personal triumph that Johnson craved, but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the MFDP would trigger disaffection with Johnson and the Democratic Party from the left; SNCC chairman John Lewis would call it a \"turning point in the civil rights movement\".\nEarly in the 1964 presidential campaign, Barry Goldwater appeared to be a strong contender, with strong support from the South, which threatened Johnson's position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act. However, Goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed. On September 7, 1964, Johnson's campaign managers broadcast the \"Daisy ad\": it portrayed a little girl picking petals from a daisy, followed by a countdown and explosion of a nuclear bomb. The message conveyed was that electing Goldwater risked a nuclear war. Goldwater's campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming \"In your heart, you know he's right\". Opponents captured the spirit of Johnson's campaign with bumper stickers that said \"In your heart, you know he might\" and \"In your guts, you know he's nuts\". CIA Director William Colby asserted that Tracy Barnes instructed the CIA to spy on the Goldwater campaign and the Republican National Committee to provide information to Johnson's campaign. Johnson won the presidency by a landslide with 61.05\u00a0percent of the vote, making it the highest ever share of the popular vote. At the time, this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century \u200d\u2014\u200c more than 15.95\u00a0million votes \u200d\u2014\u200c this was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon's victory in 1972. In the Electoral College, Johnson defeated Goldwater by a margin of 486 to 52. Johnson won 44 states, compared to Goldwater's six. Voters also gave Johnson the largest majorities in Congress since FDR's election in 1936 \u200d\u2014\u200c a Senate with a 68\u201332 majority and a House with a 295\u2013140 Democratic margin.\nVoting Rights Act.\nSoon after the 1964 election, civil rights organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) began a push for federal action to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. On March 7, 1965, these organizations began the Selma to Montgomery marches in which Selma residents proceeded to march to Alabama's capital, Montgomery, to highlight voting rights issues and present Governor George Wallace with their grievances. On the first march, demonstrators were stopped by state and county police, who shot tear gas into the crowd and trampled protesters. Televised footage of the scene, which became known as \"Bloody Sunday\", generated outrage across the country. In response to the rapidly increasing political pressure upon him, Johnson decided to immediately send voting rights legislation to Congress, and to address the American people in a speech before a Joint session of Congress. He began:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy. I urge every member of both parties, Americans of all religions and of all colors, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause. ... Rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself. Rarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth or abundance, or our welfare or our security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation. For, with a country as with a person, 'what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?'\nJohnson and Dirksen established a strong bipartisan alliance in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, precluding the possibility of a Senate filibuster defeating the bill. In August 1965, the House approved the bill by a vote of 333 to 85, and Senate passed the bill by a vote of 79 to 18. The landmark legislation outlawed discrimination in voting, thus allowing millions of Southern blacks to vote for the first time. The results were significant; between the years of 1968 and 1980, the number of Southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled. In Mississippi, the voter registration rate of African Americans rose from 6.7 percent to 59.8 percent between 1964 and 1967, a reflection of a broader increase in African-American voter registration rates.\nAfter the murder of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo, Johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four Ku Klux Klans men implicated in her death. He angrily denounced the Klan as a \"hooded society of bigots,\" and warned them to \"return to a decent society before it's too late\". Johnson was the first president to arrest and prosecute members of the Klan since Ulysses S. Grant. He turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights, mobilizing support from churches. At the Howard University commencement address on June 4, 1965, he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve these goals: \"To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin. To dissolve, as best we can, the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder, divide the great democracy, and do wrong \u200d\u2014\u200c great wrong \u200d\u2014\u200c to the children of God ...\"\nFair Housing Act.\nThe Fair Housing Act, a component of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, outlawed several forms of housing discrimination and effectively allowed many African Americans to move to the suburbs. Johnson submitted a bill to Congress in April 1966 that barred house owners from refusing to enter into agreements on the basis of race; the bill immediately garnered opposition from many of the Northerners who had supported the last two major civil rights bills. Though a version of the bill passed the House, it failed to win Senate approval, marking Johnson's first major legislative defeat. The law gained new impetus after the April 4, 1968, assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and the civil unrest across the country that followed. The bill passed Congress on April 10 and was quickly signed into law by Johnson.\nWar on poverty.\nIn his 1964 State of the Union Address Johnson stated, \"this administration today, here and now, declares an unconditional war on poverty in America. Our aim is not only to relieve the symptoms of poverty but to cure it\u2013and above all, to prevent it.\" During the Johnson administration, national poverty declined significantly, with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 to 12\u00a0percent.\nIn August 1964, Johnson signed the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which would create the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to oversee local Community Action Agencies (CAA) charged with dispensing aid to those in poverty. Each CAA was required to have \"maximum feasible participation\" from local residents, who would design and operate anti-poverty programs unique to their communities' needs. This was threatening to local political leaders who saw CAAs as alternative power structures in their own communities, funded and encouraged by the OEO. In 1967, the Green Amendment gave city governments the right to decide which entity would be the official CAA for their community. The net result was a halt to the citizen participation reform movement.\nThe Economic Opportunity Act created the Job Corps and Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), a domestic version of the Peace Corps. Modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), Job Corps was a residential education and job-training program that provided academic and vocational skills to low-income at-risk young people. VISTA deployed volunteers on community projects across the nation to address issues such as illiteracy, inadequate housing, and poor health. By the end of 1965, 2,000 volunteers had signed on. Congress also agreed to Upward Bound, a program that trained low-income students in the skills they needed for college. The act reflected Johnson's belief that the government could best help the impoverished by providing them with economic opportunities. Johnson convinced Congress to approve the Food Stamp Act of 1964, which made permanent the food stamp pilot programs that had been initiated by President Kennedy. \nTo combat homelessness, Johnson signed the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, which provided rent subsidies for the elderly and disabled, construction of 240,000 housing units, and $3 billion for urban renewal. In September 1965, Johnson would go on to sign legislation that would establish the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), to oversee the newly funded housing programs. Providing an additional $1.1 billion for roads, health clinics, and other public works was the Appalachian Regional Development Act, a measure to improve living standards in Appalachia.\nJohnson took an additional step in the war on poverty with an urban renewal effort, the \"Demonstration Cities Program\". To be eligible, a city was required to demonstrate its readiness to \"arrest blight and decay and make a substantial impact on the development of its entire city\". Johnson requested an investment of $400\u00a0million per year totaling $2.4\u00a0billion. In late 1966, Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing $900\u00a0million, which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program. \"The New York Times\" wrote 22\u00a0years later that the program was largely a failure.\nHealthcare reform.\nJohnson's initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Strokes (HDCS). These diseases accounted for 71\u00a0percent of the nation's deaths in 1962.\nIn 1965, Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security. The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Representative Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. To reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as three layers: hospital insurance under Social Security; a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits; and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor administered through the states, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the House by a margin of 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated, but the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28. Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans.\nImmigration.\nThe sweeping Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 reformed the country's immigration system and repealed the National Origins Formula, which had restricted emigration from countries outside of Western Europe and the Western Hemisphere. The annual rate of inflow doubled between 1965 and 1970, and doubled again by 1990, with dramatic increases from Asia and Latin America, including Mexico. Scholars give Johnson little credit for the law, which was not one of his priorities; he had supported the McCarren\u2013Walter Act of 1952, which proved unpopular with reformers.\nFederal funding for education.\nJohnson, whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, believed that education was an essential component of the American dream, especially for minorities. He made education the top priority of the Great Society agenda, with an emphasis on helping poor children. Buoyed by his landslide victory in the 1964 election, in early 1965 Johnson proposed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which would double federal spending on education from $4 billion to $8 billion. The bill quickly passed both houses of Congress by wide margins. ESEA increased funding to all school districts, but directed more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families.\nAlthough ESEA solidified Johnson's support among K\u201312 teachers' unions, neither the Higher Education Act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in Vietnam. Johnson's second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965, which increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships, gave low-interest loans to students, and established a Teacher Corps. Johnson also established Head Start, an early education program to help prepare children from disadvantaged families for success in public schools. In 1967, Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act to create educational television programs to supplement broadcast networks.\nIn 1965, Johnson set up the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts, to support the study of literature, history, and law, and arts such as music, painting, and sculpture.\nTransportation.\nIn March 1966, Johnson sent to Congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new Transportation Department, comprising the Commerce Department's Office of Transportation, the Bureau of Public Roads, the Federal Aviation Agency, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The bill passed the Senate after some negotiation over navigation projects; in the House, passage required negotiation over maritime interests and the bill was signed October 15, 1965.\nEnvironment.\nDuring his tenure as president, Johnson signed over 300 conservation measures into law, forming the legal basis of the modern environmental movement. He signed into law the Clean Air Act of 1963, which had been proposed by President Kennedy. The Clean Air Act set emission standards for stationary emitters of air pollutants and directed federal funding to air quality research. In 1965, the act was amended by the Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act, which directed the federal government to establish and enforce national standards for controlling the emission of pollutants from new motor vehicles and engines. In September 1964, Johnson signed the Wilderness Act, which established the National Wilderness Preservation System (preserving 9.1 million acres of forestland from industrial development), and signed a law establishing the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which aids the purchase of land used for federal and state parks.\nIn 1965, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson took the lead in calling for passage of the Highway Beautification Act. The act called for control of outdoor advertising, including removal of certain types of signs, along the nation's growing Interstate Highway System and the existing federal-aid primary highway system. It also required certain junkyards along Interstate or primary highways to be removed or screened and encouraged scenic enhancement and roadside development.\nGun control.\nThough Johnson had already introduced a gun control bill on June 6, 1968, after the assassination of Robert Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson's press secretary Liz Carpenter, in a memo to the president, worried that the country had been \"brainwashed by high drama,\" and that Johnson \"need[ed] some quick dramatic actions\" that addressed \"the issue of violence.\" In October, Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968, but did not invoke the memory of Robert Kennedy as he had so often done with his brother\u2013an omission historian Jeff Shesol has argued was motivated by Johnson's longstanding contempt for Robert. The measure prohibited convicted felons, drug users, and the mentally ill from purchasing handguns and raised record-keeping and licensing requirements. It also banned mail order sales of rifles and shotguns.\nUrban riots.\nThe nation experienced a series of \"long hot summers\" of civil unrest during the Johnson years. They started with the Harlem riots in 1964, and the Watts district of Los Angeles in 1965. The momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt following the riots in Watts. After 34 people were killed and $35\u00a0million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024) in property was damaged, the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities, and so the appetite for additional programs in Johnson's agenda was lost.\nIn what is known as the \"Long hot summer of 1967\", more than 150 riots erupted across the United States. The \"Boston Globe\" called it \"a revolution of black Americans against white Americans, a violent petition for the redress of long-standing grievances.\" The Newark riots left 26 dead and 1,500 injured. The Detroit riot resulted in 43 deaths, 2250 injuries, 4,000 arrests, and millions of dollars' worth of property damage. Governor George Romney sent in 7,400 national guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. At an August 2, 1967, cabinet meeting, Attorney General Ramsey Clark warned that untrained and undisciplined local police forces and National Guardsmen might trigger a \"guerrilla war in the streets,\" as evidenced by the climate of sniper fire in Newark and Detroit. Snipers created a dangerous situation for both law enforcement and civilians, with shooters often targeting from rooftops and other concealed locations.\nJohnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities and his own party. The president created the 11-member Kerner Commission to study the causes behind the recurring outbreaks of urban civil disorder, headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. The commission's 1968 report suggested legislative measures to promote racial integration and alleviate poverty and concluded that the nation was \"moving toward two societies, one black, one white\u2014separate and unequal.\" According to Press Secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: \"What did you expect? ... When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's he going to do? He's going to knock your block off.\"\nBacklash against Johnson (1966\u20131967).\nIn 1966, the press sensed a credibility gap between what Johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening in the Vietnam War, which led to less favorable coverage of Johnson and his administration.\nBy the end of 1966, Democratic Governor Warren E. Hearnes of Missouri warned that Johnson would lose the state by 100,000 votes, despite winning by a margin of 500,000 in 1964. \"Frustration over Vietnam; too much federal spending and ... taxation; no great public support for your Great Society programs; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs \"had eroded the President's standing, the governor reported. There were bright spots; in January 1967, Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history, unemployment was at a 13-year low, and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever; a 4.5\u00a0percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome, as was the rise in interest rates. Johnson asked for a temporary 6\u00a0percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending. Johnson's approval ratings stayed below 50\u00a0percent and, in December 1966, his disapproval rating surpassed his approval rating. In January 1967, the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16\u00a0percent, from 25\u00a0percent four months before.\nAsked to explain his diminished popularity, Johnson said, \"I am a dominating personality, and when I get things done I don't always please all the people.\" Johnson also blamed the press, saying they showed \"complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to\", and \"the preachers, liberals and professors\" who had turned against him.\nIn the congressional elections of 1966, the Republicans gained three seats in the Senate and 47 in the House, reinvigorating the conservative coalition, which made it more difficult for Johnson to pass additional Great Society legislation. However, Congress ultimately passed almost 96\u00a0percent of the administration's Great Society programs.\nSpace program.\nDuring the Johnson administration, NASA conducted the Gemini crewed space program, developed the Saturn V rocket and its launch facility, and prepared to make the first crewed Apollo program flights. On January 27, 1967, the nation was stunned when the entire crew of Apollo 1 was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad, stopping Apollo in its tracks. Rather than appointing another Warren-style commission, Johnson accepted Administrator James E. Webb's request for NASA to do its own investigation.\nJohnson maintained his staunch support of Apollo through Congressional and press controversy, and the program recovered. The first two crewed missions, Apollo 7 and the first crewed flight to the Moon, Apollo 8, were completed by the end of Johnson's term. He congratulated the Apollo 8 crew, saying, \"You've taken ... all of us, all over the world, into a new era.\" On July 16, 1969, Johnson attended the launch of the first Moon landing mission Apollo 11, becoming the first former or incumbent U.S. president to witness a rocket launch.\nVietnam War.\nThe Vietnam War began in 1955 as Communist forces started operating in South Vietnam. By the time Johnson took office, there were 16,700 American military personnel in South Vietnam. Despite some misgivings, Johnson ultimately came to support escalation of the U.S. role in Vietnam. Like the vast majority of American leaders in the mid-1960s, he was determined to prevent the spread of Communism. Johnson's decision to escalate was also influenced heavily by reputation. Under pressure from pro-war politicians like Barry Goldwater, Johnson feared that if he made the decision to not stand firm in Vietnam he would lose domestic political credibility as well as contribute to a decline in the international reputation of the U.S.\nOn October 11, 1963, President Kennedy had signed NSAM 263 ordering the withdrawal of 1,000 military personnel by the end of the year following recommendations of the McNamara\u2013Taylor mission report. On November 26, Johnson signed NSAM 273 which reaffirmed the Kennedy administration withdrawal approval and continued support for South Vietnam. In August 1964, ambiguous evidence suggested two U.S. destroyers had been attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin. Although Johnson very much wanted to keep discussions about Vietnam out of the 1964 election campaign, he felt forced to respond to the supposed Communist aggression. He obtained from Congress the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 7, 1964, giving blanket congressional approval for use of military force to repel future attacks.\nJohnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign, which became known as Operation Rolling Thunder, in February 1965 after an attack by Viet Cong guerrillas on Pleiku Air Base, killing eight Americans. The U.S. would continue to bomb North Vietnam until late 1968. In March 1965, McGeorge Bundy called for American ground operations; Johnson agreed and also quietly changed the mission from defensive to offensive operations. On March 8, 1965, 3,500 troops went ashore near Da Nang, the first time U.S. combat forces had been sent to mainland Asia since the Korean War. In June, South Vietnamese Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse. In late July, McNamara and Johnson's top advisors recommended an increase in U.S. soldiers from 75,000 to over 200,000. Johnson agreed but felt boxed in by unpalatable choices. If he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist, and if he did not, he thought he risked being impeached. By October 1965, there were over 200,000 troops deployed in Vietnam. Throughout 1965, few members of Congress or the administration openly criticized Johnson's handling of the war.\nIn early 1966, Senator Robert F. Kennedy harshly criticized Johnson's bombing campaign, stating that the U.S. may be headed \"on a road from which there is no turning back, a road that leads to catastrophe for all mankind.\" Soon thereafter, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Senator James William Fulbright, held televised hearings examining the administration's Vietnam policy. In July, polling results indicated that Americans favored the bombing campaign by a five-to-one margin; however, in August a Defense Department study indicated that the bombing campaign was having minimal impact on North Vietnam. By late 1966, multiple sources began to report progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure; Johnson was urged to begin peace discussions. English philosopher Bertrand Russell initiated the International War Crimes Tribunal to condemn the American effort. The gap with Hanoi, however, was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces. Johnson grew more and more anxious about justifying war casualties, and talked of the need for decisive victory, despite the unpopularity of the cause. By the end of 1966, it was clear that the air campaign and the pacification effort had both failed, and Johnson agreed to McNamara's new recommendation to add 70,000 troops in 1967 and the CIA's recommendations to increased bombings against North Vietnam. The bombing escalation ended secret talks being held with North Vietnam, but U.S. leaders did not consider North Vietnamese intentions in those talks to be genuine.\nBy the middle of 1967 nearly 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded in the war, which was being commonly described in the news media and elsewhere as a \"stalemate.\" In January and February, probes were made to assess North Vietnamese's willingness to discuss peace, but they fell on deaf ears. Ho Chi Minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral U.S. withdrawal. A Gallup, Inc. poll in July 1967 showed that 52\u00a0percent of Americans disapproved of the president's handling of the war, and only 34\u00a0percent thought progress was being made. Nonetheless, Johnson agreed to an increase of 55,000 troops, bringing the total to 525,000. In August, Johnson, with the Joint Chiefs' support, decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only Hanoi, Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list. Later that month McNamara told a Senate subcommittee that an expanded air campaign would not bring Hanoi to the peace table. The Joint Chiefs were astounded, and threatened mass resignation; McNamara was summoned to the White House for a three-hour dressing down. Nevertheless, Johnson had received reports from the CIA confirming McNamara's analysis at least in part. In the meantime an election establishing a constitutional government in the South was concluded and provided hope for peace talks.\nWith the war arguably in a stalemate and in light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict, Johnson convened a group of veteran government foreign policy experts, informally known as \"the Wise Men\": Dean Acheson, General Omar Bradley, George Ball, McGeorge Bundy, Arthur Dean, C. Douglas Dillon, Abe Fortas, Averell Harriman, Henry Cabot Lodge, Robert Daniel Murphy, and Maxwell D. Taylor. They unanimously opposed leaving Vietnam, and encouraged Johnson to \"stay the course.\" Afterward, on November 17, in a nationally televised address, the president assured the American public, \"We are inflicting greater losses than we're taking...We are making progress.\" Less than two weeks later, Robert McNamara announced his resignation as Defense Secretary. Behind closed doors, he had begun regularly expressing doubts over Johnson's war strategy, angering the president. He joined a growing list of Johnson's top aides who resigned over the war, including Bill Moyers, McGeorge Bundy, and George Ball. In October, with ever-increasing public protests against the war, Johnson engaged the FBI and the CIA to investigate, monitor, and undermine anti-war activists. In mid-October, there was a demonstration of 100,000 at the Pentagon; Johnson and Dean Rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration, but that was refuted in the CIA's findings.\nTet Offensive.\nOn January 30, 1968, the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army began the Tet Offensive against South Vietnam's five largest cities, including Saigon. While the Tet Offensive failed militarily, it was a psychological victory, definitively turning American public opinion against the war effort. In February 1968, influential news anchor Walter Cronkite of CBS News expressed on the air that the conflict was deadlocked and that additional fighting would change nothing. Johnson reacted, saying \"If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America\". Indeed, demoralization about the war was everywhere; 26 percent then approved of Johnson's handling of Vietnam, while 63 percent disapproved. College students and others protested, burned draft cards, and chanted, \"Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?\"\nThe Tet Offensive convinced senior leaders of the Johnson administration, including the \"Wise Men\" and new Defense Secretary Clark Clifford, that further escalation of troop levels would not help bring an end to the war. Johnson was initially reluctant to follow this advice, but ultimately agreed to allow a partial bombing halt and to signal his willingness to engage in peace talks. On March 31, 1968, Johnson announced that he would halt the bombing in North Vietnam, while at the same time announcing that he would not seek re-election. He also escalated U.S. military operations in South Vietnam in order to consolidate control of as much of the countryside as possible before the onset of serious peace talks. Talks began in Paris in May, but failed to yield any results. Two of the major obstacles in negotiations were the unwillingness of the United States to allow the Viet Cong to take part in the South Vietnamese government, and the unwillingness of North Vietnam to recognize the legitimacy of South Vietnam. In October 1968, when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt, Republican presidential nominee Richard Nixon intervened with the South Vietnamese, promising better terms so as to delay a settlement on the issue until after the election. Johnson sought a continuation of talks after the 1968 election, but the North Vietnamese argued about procedural matters until after Nixon took office.\nDominican Republic.\nLike President Kennedy, Johnson sought to isolate Cuba, which was under the rule of the Soviet-aligned Fidel Castro.\nIn 1965, the Dominican Civil War broke out between the government of President Donald Reid Cabral and supporters of former president Juan Bosch. On the advice of Abe Fortas, Johnson dispatched over 20,000 Marines to the Dominican Republic. Their role was not take sides but to evacuate American citizens and restore order. The U.S. also helped arrange an agreement providing for new elections. Johnson's use of force in ending the civil war alienated many in Latin America, and the region's importance to the administration receded as Johnson's foreign policy became increasingly dominated by the Vietnam War.\nSoviet Union.\nThough actively engaged in containment in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, Johnson made it a priority to seek arms control deals with Moscow. The Soviet Union also sought closer relations to the United States during the mid-to-late 1960s, partly due to the increasingly worse Sino-Soviet split. Johnson attempted to reduce tensions with China by easing restrictions on trade, but the beginning of China's Cultural Revolution ended hopes of a greater rapprochement. Johnson was concerned with averting the possibility of nuclear war, and he sought to reduce tensions in Europe. The Johnson administration pursued arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, signing the Outer Space Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and laid the foundation for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. Johnson held a largely amicable meeting with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin at the Glassboro Summit Conference in 1967, and in July 1968 the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in which each signatory agreed not to help other countries develop or acquire nuclear weapons. A planned nuclear disarmament summit between the United States and the Soviet Union was scuttled after Soviet forces violently suppressed the Prague Spring, an attempted democratization of Czechoslovakia.\nSurveillance of Martin Luther King.\nJohnson continued the FBI's wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. authorized by the Kennedy administration under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Johnson also authorized the tapping of phone conversations of others, including the Vietnamese friends of a Nixon associate.\nInternational trips.\nJohnson made eleven international trips to twenty countries during his presidency. He flew aboard Air Force One while in office. His October 1966 visit to Australia sparked demonstrations from anti-war protesters. One of the most unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before Christmas 1967. The President began the trip by going to the memorial for Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt, who was presumed drowned in a swimming accident. The White House did not reveal in advance to the press that the President would make the first round-the-world presidential trip. The trip was completed in only 112.5\u00a0hours (4.7\u00a0days). Air Force One crossed the equator twice, stopped at Travis Air Force Base, in Honolulu, Pago Pago, Canberra, Melbourne, Vietnam, Karachi, and Rome.\n1968 presidential election.\nAs he had served less than two years of President Kennedy's term, Johnson was constitutionally eligible for election to a second full term in the 1968 presidential election. Despite Johnson's growing unpopularity, conventional wisdom held that it would be impossible to deny re-nomination to a sitting president. In September 1967 Johnson openly admitted he was considering dropping out of the race for re-election. Johnson won a narrow victory in the New Hampshire presidential primary on March 12, but in a March 31 speech, Johnson shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for re-election by concluding with the line: \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president\". The next day, his approval ratings increased from 36 percent to 49 percent.\nHistorians have debated the factors that led to Johnson's surprise decision. Shesol says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication; when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave. Woods writes that Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal. Dallek says that Johnson had no further domestic goals, and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity. His health was not good, and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink. Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker. Bennett, however, says Johnson \"had been forced out of a reelection race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in Southeast Asia.\" Johnson may also have hoped that the convention would ultimately choose to draft him back into the race.\nVice President Hubert Humphrey entered the race after Johnson's withdrawal, making the 1968 Democratic primaries a three-way contest between Humphrey, Kennedy, and McCarthy. Kennedy cut into McCarthy's liberal and anti-war base, while also winning the support of the poor and working class. He won a series of primary victories, but was assassinated in June by Sirhan Sirhan, an Arab nationalist. With Johnson's support, Humphrey won the presidential nomination at the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago in late August. Violent police attacks against anti-war protesters in Chicago marred the convention.\nHumphrey's polling numbers improved after a September 30 speech in which he broke with Johnson's war policy, calling for an end to the bombing of North Vietnam. In what was termed the October surprise, Johnson announced to the nation on October 31, 1968, that he had ordered a complete cessation of \"all air, naval and artillery bombardment of North Vietnam\", effective November 1, should the North Vietnamese government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the Paris peace talks.\nRepublican nominee Richard Nixon won the election.\nJudicial appointments.\nJohnson appointed Justices Abe Fortas (1965) and Thurgood Marshall (1967) to the Supreme Court of the United States. Johnson anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures in 1965 and thought it advantageous to have a \"mole\" in the Supreme Court to provide him with inside information, as he was able to get from the legislative branch. Abe Fortas in particular Johnson thought could fill the bill. The opportunity arose when an opening occurred for ambassador to the UN, with Adlai Stevenson's death; Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg accepted Johnson's offer to transfer to the UN position. Johnson insisted on Fortas assuming Goldberg's seat, over Fortas's wife's objection that it was too early in his career. When Earl Warren announced his retirement in 1968, Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed him as Chief Justice of the United States, and nominated Homer Thornberry to succeed Fortas as associate justice. However, Fortas's nomination was filibustered by senators, and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate.\nPost-presidency (1969\u20131973).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On Inauguration Day (January 20, 1969), Johnson saw Nixon sworn in, then got on the plane to fly back to Texas. When the front door of the plane closed, Johnson pulled out a cigarette \u200d\u2014\u200c his first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in 1955. One of his daughters pulled it out of his mouth and said, \"Daddy, what are you doing? You're going to kill yourself.\" He took it back and said, \"I've now raised you, girls. I've now been President. \"Now it's my time!\"\" From that point on, he went into a very self-destructive spiral.\u2014\u200a\nAfter leaving the presidency in January 1969, Johnson went home to his ranch in Stonewall, Texas, accompanied by former aide and speechwriter Harry J. Middleton, who would draft Johnson's first book, \"The Choices We Face,\" and work with him on his memoirs, \"The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency 1963\u20131969,\" published in 1971. That year, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum opened on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin. He donated his Texas ranch in his will to the public to form the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, with the provision that it \"remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past\".\nJohnson gave Nixon high grades in foreign policy, but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing U.S. forces from South Vietnam before the South Vietnamese were able to defend themselves. \"If the South falls to the Communists, we can have a serious backlash here at home,\" he warned.\nDuring the 1972 presidential election, Johnson only reluctantly endorsed Democratic nominee George McGovern, a senator from South Dakota; McGovern had long opposed Johnson's foreign and defense policies. Johnson wanted to attend the Democratic National Convention, but was advised not to attend as he would not be welcome. The McGovern nomination and platform dismayed him. Nixon could be defeated, Johnson insisted, \"if only the Democrats don't go too far left\". Johnson felt Edmund Muskie would be more likely to defeat Nixon; however, he declined to try to stop McGovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the Democratic Party was such that anything he said was more likely to help McGovern. Johnson's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 John Connally had served as President Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury and then stepped down to head \"Democrats for Nixon\", a group funded by Republicans. It was the first time that Connally and Johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and children.\nOn November 17, 1934, Johnson married Claudia Alta \"Lady Bird\" Taylor from Karnack, Texas. The two first met after he attended Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C. for one semester. During their first date, Johnson asked her to marry him; many dates later, she finally agreed. The wedding was officiated by Arthur R. McKinstry at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in San Antonio. They had two daughters: Lynda Bird in 1944 and Luci Baines in 1947. Johnson gave his children names with the LBJ initials; his dog was named Little Beagle Johnson, and his home was the LBJ Ranch in the Texas Hill Country. His initials were on his cufflinks, ashtrays, and clothes. During his marriage, Johnson had affairs with \"numerous\" women, including socialite Alice Marsh, who was considered, outside his marriage, his most important relationship.\nHealth.\nOn July 2, 1955, at age 46, Johnson, a 60-cigarette-per-day smoker, suffered a near-fatal heart attack, which inspired him to discontinue smoking. Five months later, Johnson's doctors reported he had made \"a most satisfactory recovery\".\nJohnson may have suffered a second heart attack following President Kennedy's assassination, but the diagnosis released to the public was that he had an angina attack.\nOn November 8, 1965, Johnson underwent surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove his gallbladder and a kidney stone. After the procedure, Johnson's doctors reported that the president had come through the surgery \"beautifully as expected.\" He was able to resume his duties the following day, and he met with reporters a couple of days later to reassure the nation that he was recovering well. Although Johnson was incapacitated during surgery, there was no transfer of presidential power to Vice President Humphrey.\nIn March 1970, Johnson suffered an attack of angina and was taken to Brooke Army General Hospital in San Antonio. He had gained more than since leaving the White House; he now weighed around and was urged to lose considerable weight. By the summer of 1970, again gripped by chronic chest pains, Johnson lost in less than a month on a crash water diet. He had also resumed smoking shortly before Christmas 1971, having not smoked since his near-fatal heart attack in July 1955.\nIn April 1972, Johnson had another major heart attack while visiting his daughter, Lynda, in Virginia. \"I'm hurting real bad\", he confided to friends. The chest pains returned nearly every afternoon \u200d\u2014\u200c jolting pains that left him frightened and breathless. A portable oxygen tank was kept by his bed, and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask. He continued to smoke heavily and, although nominally on a low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, kept to it only intermittently. Meanwhile, he began to experience severe abdominal pains, diagnosed as diverticulosis. His heart condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended. Johnson flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Michael DeBakey, where he learned his condition was terminal. DeBakey found that despite two of Johnson's coronary arteries being in urgent need of a coronary bypass, his heart was in such poor condition that he likely would have died during surgery.\nDeath.\nJohnson recorded an hour-long television interview with newsman Walter Cronkite at his ranch on January 12, 1973, in which he discussed his legacy, particularly about the civil rights movement. He was still smoking heavily, and told Cronkite that it was better for his heart \"to smoke than to be nervous\".\nAt approximately 3:50 P.M. Central on January 22, 1973, Johnson suffered his final heart attack in his bedroom. He managed to telephone the Secret Service agents on the ranch, who found him still holding the telephone receiver, unconscious and \"appear[ing] to be dead\". They attempted resuscitation, and Johnson was airlifted in one of his planes to San Antonio International Airport, en route to Brooke Army Medical Center. However, cardiologist and Army colonel George McGranahan pronounced him dead on arrival at the airport at 4:33 P.M. Johnson was 64.\nShortly after the former president was pronounced dead, Johnson's press secretary Tom Johnson (no relation) telephoned Cronkite to tell him. Cronkite was anchoring \"CBS Evening News\" live at the moment Johnson reached him, which enabled him to report on President Johnson's death as he received direct information. Nixon mentioned Johnson's death in a speech he gave the day after Johnson died, announcing the peace agreement to end the Vietnam War.\nFuneral.\nJohnson was honored with a state funeral. Initially, his body lay in repose at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin. Afterwards, Johnson's body was flown to Washington. Texas Congressman J. J. Pickle and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk eulogized him when he lay in state at the Capitol.\nThe state funeral took place on January 25 at the National City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., where he had often worshiped as president. The service was presided over by President Nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries, led by Eisaku Sat\u014d, who had served as Japanese prime minister during Johnson's presidency. Eulogies were given by George Davis, the church's pastor, and W. Marvin Watson, Johnson's last Postmaster General and a longtime advisor.\nLater that same day, Johnson was buried in his family's private cemetery in Gillespie County, Texas, near the house in which he was born. Billy Graham officiated the service. He and former Texas governor Connally gave eulogies. Several hundred people were in attendance.\nThe state funeral, the last for a president until Richard Nixon's in 1994, occurred the same week as Nixon's second inauguration. As Johnson died only two days after the inauguration, various activities surrounding the inauguration were canceled.\nPersonality and public image.\nAccording to biographer Randall Woods, Johnson posed in many different roles:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Johnson the Son of the Tenant Farmer, Johnson the Great Compromiser, Johnson the All-Knowing, Johnson the Humble, Johnson the Warrior, Johnson the Dove, Johnson the Romantic, Johnson the Hard-Headed Pragmatist, Johnson the Preserver of Traditions, Johnson the Crusader for Social Justice, Johnson the Magnanimous, Johnson the Vindictive or Johnson the Uncouth, LBJ the Hick, Lyndon the Satyr, and Johnson the Usurper\".\nJohnson had his particular brand of persuasion, known as \"The Johnson Treatment\". \"There was no more powerful majority leader in American history,\" biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, \"He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them.\" As president, Johnson vetoed 30 bills; no other president in history vetoed so many bills and never had a single one overridden by Congress. He was often seen as an ambitious, tireless, and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He typically worked 18- to 20-hour days without a break and had no regular leisure activities. He stood tall.\nJohnson's cowboy hat and boots reflected his Texas roots and love of the rural hill country. From of land that he was given by an aunt in 1951, he created a working ranch with 400 cattle. The National Park Service keeps a herd descended from Johnson's and maintains the ranch property.\nBiographer Randall Woods argues that Social Gospel themes Johnson learned from childhood allowed him to transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, and explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach to Christian internationalism and nation-building. For example, in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church, adding \"It would be very hard for me to write a more perfect description of the American ideal.\"\nLegacy.\nScholars have viewed Johnson through the lens of both his legislative achievements and his lack of success in the Vietnam War. His overall rating among historians has remained relatively steady, and his average ranking is higher than any of the eight presidents who followed him, although similar to Reagan and Clinton. In public polling of presidential favorability of Johnson and the presidents who succeeded him Johnson tends to appear more toward the bottom of lists, typically excepting Donald Trump, George W. Bush and Richard Nixon, and sometimes Gerald Ford.\nHistorian Kent Germany explains:The man who was elected to the White House by one of the widest margins in U.S. history and pushed through as much legislation as any other American politician now seems to be remembered best by the public for succeeding an assassinated hero, steering the country into a quagmire in Vietnam, cheating on his saintly wife, exposing his stitched-up belly, using profanity, picking up dogs by their ears, swimming naked with advisers in the White House pool, and emptying his bowels while conducting official business. Of all those issues, Johnson's reputation suffers the most from his management of the Vietnam War, something that has overshadowed his civil rights and domestic policy accomplishments and caused Johnson himself to regret his handling of \"the woman I really loved \u200d\u2014\u200c the Great Society.\"\nMemorials.\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston was renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1973, and the United States Department of Education headquarters was named after Johnson in 2007. The Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin was named in his honor, as is the Lyndon B. Johnson National Grassland. Also named for him are schools in Austin and Laredo, Texas; Melbourne, Florida; and Jackson, Kentucky. Interstate 635 in Dallas is named the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway. The Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac was dedicated in 1976.\nJohnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 1980. Texas created a state holiday on August 27 to mark Johnson's birthday, known as Lyndon Baines Johnson Day.\nMajor legislation signed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

{"id": "54536", "revid": "134766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54536", "title": "Citric acid", "text": "Weak organic acid\n \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nCitric acid is an organic compound with the formula . It is a colorless weak organic acid. It occurs naturally in citrus fruits. In biochemistry, it is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, which occurs in the metabolism of all aerobic organisms.\nMore than two million tons of citric acid are manufactured every year. It is used widely as acidifier, flavoring, preservative, and chelating agent.\nA citrate is a derivative of citric acid; that is, the salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion found in solutions and salts of citric acid. An example of the former, a salt is trisodium citrate; an ester is triethyl citrate. When citrate trianion is part of a salt, the formula of the citrate trianion is written as C6H5O73- or C3H5O(COO)33-.\nNatural occurrence and industrial production.\nCitric acid occurs in a variety of fruits and vegetables, most notably citrus fruits. Lemons and limes have particularly high concentrations of the acid; it can constitute as much as 8% of the dry weight of these fruits (about 47\u00a0g/L in the juices). The concentrations of citric acid in citrus fruits range from 0.005\u00a0mol/L for oranges and grapefruits to 0.30\u00a0mol/L in lemons and limes; these values vary within species depending upon the cultivar and the circumstances under which the fruit was grown.\nCitric acid was first isolated in 1784 by the chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who crystallized it from lemon juice.\nIndustrial-scale citric acid production first began in 1890 based on the Italian citrus fruit industry, where the juice was treated with hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) to precipitate calcium citrate, which was isolated and converted back to the acid using diluted sulfuric acid. In 1893, C. Wehmer discovered \"Penicillium\" mold could produce citric acid from sugar. However, microbial production of citric acid did not become industrially important until World War I disrupted Italian \"Citrus\" exports.\nIn 1917, American food chemist James Currie discovered that certain strains of the mold \"Aspergillus niger\" could be efficient citric acid producers, and the pharmaceutical company Pfizer began industrial-level production using this technique two years later, followed by Citrique Belge in 1929. In this production technique, which is still the major industrial route to citric acid used today, cultures of \"Aspergillus niger\" are fed on a sucrose or glucose-containing medium to produce citric acid. The source of sugar is corn steep liquor, molasses, hydrolyzed corn starch, or other inexpensive, carbohydrate solution. After the mold is filtered out of the resulting suspension, citric acid is isolated by precipitating it with calcium hydroxide to yield calcium citrate salt, from which citric acid is regenerated by treatment with sulfuric acid, as in the direct extraction from citrus fruit juice.\nIn 1977, a patent was granted to Lever Brothers for the chemical synthesis of citric acid starting either from aconitic or isocitrate (also called alloisocitrate) calcium salts under high pressure conditions; this produced citric acid in near quantitative conversion under what appeared to be a reverse, non-enzymatic Krebs cycle reaction.\nAlthough industrial-scale production of citric acid by chemical synthesis or extraction from citrus fruits are both feasible, fermentation by molds (and sometimes yeasts) is almost exclusively the only method actually practiced.\nGlobal production was in excess of 2,000,000 tons in 2018. More than 50% of this volume was produced in China. More than 50% was used as an acidity regulator in beverages, some 20% in other food applications, 20% for detergent applications, and 10% for applications other than food, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and in the chemical industry.\nChemical characteristics.\nCitric acid is known to occur as a monohydrate, though the anhydrous form can be obtained by crystallization from hot water. \nWater can be driven off the monohydrate to produce the anhydrate by heating to around 80\u00a0\u00b0C, though this can also occur at ambient temperatures slowly over time by efflorescence at humidities in range of ~50% or less.\nCitric acid dissolves in absolute (anhydrous) ethanol (76 parts of citric acid per 100 parts of ethanol) at 15\u00a0\u00b0C. It decomposes with loss of carbon dioxide above about 175\u00a0\u00b0C.\nCitric acid is a triprotic acid, with pKa values, extrapolated to zero ionic strength, of 3.128, 4.761, and 6.396 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The pKa of the hydroxyl group has been found, by means of 13C NMR spectroscopy, to be 14.4. \nThe speciation diagram shows that solutions of citric acid are buffer solutions between about pH\u00a02 and pH\u00a08. In biological systems around pH 7, the two species present are the citrate ion and mono-hydrogen citrate ion. The SSC 20X hybridization buffer is an example in common use. Tables compiled for biochemical studies are available.\nConversely, the pH of a 1\u00a0mM solution of citric acid will be about 3.2. The pH of fruit juices from citrus fruits like oranges and lemons depends on the citric acid concentration, with a higher concentration of citric acid resulting in a lower pH.\nAcid salts of citric acid can be prepared by careful adjustment of the pH before crystallizing the compound. See, for example, sodium citrate.\nThe citrate ion forms complexes with metallic cations. The stability constants for the formation of these complexes are quite large because of the chelate effect. Consequently, it forms complexes even with alkali metal cations. However, when a chelate complex is formed using all three carboxylate groups, the chelate rings have 7 and 8 members, which are generally less stable thermodynamically than smaller chelate rings. In consequence, the hydroxyl group can be deprotonated, forming part of a more stable 5-membered ring, as in ammonium ferric citrate, .\nCitric acid can be esterified at one or more of its three carboxylic acid groups to form any of a variety of mono-, di-, tri-, and mixed esters.\nBiochemistry.\nCitric acid cycle.\nCitrate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, also known as the \"tricarboxylic acid\" (\"TCA\") \"cycle\" or the \"Krebs cycle\", a central metabolic pathway for animals, plants, and bacteria. In the Krebs cycle, citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate with acetyl CoA to form citrate. Citrate then acts as the substrate for aconitase and is converted into aconitic acid. The cycle ends with regeneration of oxaloacetate. This series of chemical reactions is the source of two-thirds of the food-derived energy in higher organisms. The chemical energy released is available under the form of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Hans Adolf Krebs received the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery.\nOther biological roles.\nCitrate can be transported out of the mitochondria and into the cytoplasm, then broken down into acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis, and into oxaloacetate. Citrate is a positive modulator of this conversion, and allosterically regulates the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is the regulating enzyme in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA (the commitment step in fatty acid synthesis). In short, citrate is transported into the cytoplasm, converted into acetyl-CoA, which is then converted into malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is allosterically modulated by citrate.\nHigh concentrations of cytosolic citrate can inhibit phosphofructokinase, the catalyst of a rate-limiting step of glycolysis. This effect is advantageous: high concentrations of citrate indicate that there is a large supply of biosynthetic precursor molecules, so there is no need for phosphofructokinase to continue to send molecules of its substrate, fructose 6-phosphate, into glycolysis. Citrate acts by augmenting the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of ATP, another sign that there is no need to carry out glycolysis.\nCitrate is a vital component of bone, helping to regulate the size of apatite crystals.\nApplications.\nFood and drink.\nBecause it is one of the stronger edible acids, the dominant use of citric acid is as a flavoring and preservative in food and beverages, especially soft drinks and candies. Within the European Union it is denoted by E number E330. Citrate salts of various metals are used to deliver those minerals in a biologically available form in many dietary supplements. Citric acid has 247\u00a0kcal per 100\u00a0g. In the United States the purity requirements for citric acid as a food additive are defined by the Food Chemicals Codex, which is published by the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP).\nCitric acid can be added to ice cream as an emulsifying agent to keep fats from separating, to caramel to prevent sucrose crystallization, or in recipes in place of fresh lemon juice. Citric acid is used with sodium bicarbonate in a wide range of effervescent formulae, both for ingestion (e.g., powders and tablets) and for personal care (\"e.g.\", bath salts, bath bombs, and cleaning of grease). Citric acid sold in a dry powdered form is commonly sold in markets and groceries as \"sour salt\", due to its physical resemblance to table salt. It has use in culinary applications, as an alternative to vinegar or lemon juice, where a pure acid is needed. Citric acid can be used in food coloring to balance the pH level of a normally basic dye.\nCleaning and chelating agent.\nCitric acid is an excellent chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It can be used to treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. By chelating the metals in hard water, it lets these cleaners produce foam and work better without need for water softening. Citric acid is the active ingredient in some bathroom and kitchen cleaning solutions. A solution with a six percent concentration of citric acid will remove hard water stains from glass without scrubbing. Citric acid can be used in shampoo to wash out wax and coloring from the hair. Illustrative of its chelating abilities, citric acid was the first successful eluant used for total ion-exchange separation of the lanthanides, during the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. In the 1950s, it was replaced by the far more efficient EDTA.\nIn industry, it is used to dissolve rust from steel, and to passivate stainless steels.\nCosmetics, pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and foods.\nCitric acid is used as an acidulant in creams, gels, and liquids. Used in foods and dietary supplements, it may be classified as a processing aid if it was added for a technical or functional effect (e.g. acidulent, chelator, viscosifier, etc.). If it is still present in insignificant amounts, and the technical or functional effect is no longer present, it may be exempt from labeling &lt;21 CFR \u00a7101.100(c)&gt;.\nCitric acid is an alpha hydroxy acid and is an active ingredient in chemical skin peels.\nCitric acid is commonly used as a buffer to increase the solubility of brown heroin.\nCitric acid is used as one of the active ingredients in the production of facial tissues with antiviral properties.\nOther uses.\nThe buffering properties of citrates are used to control pH in household cleaners and pharmaceuticals.\nCitric acid is used as an odorless alternative to white vinegar for fabric dyeing with acid dyes. It can enhance the mordanting process, crosslinking fabrics and dyes through an esterification reaction.\nSodium citrate is a component of Benedict's reagent, used for both qualitative and quantitative identification of reducing sugars.\nCitric acid can be used as an alternative to nitric acid in passivation of stainless steel.\nCitric acid can be used as a lower-odor stop bath as part of the process for developing photographic film. Photographic developers are alkaline, so a mild acid is used to neutralize and stop their action quickly, but commonly used acetic acid leaves a strong vinegar odor in the darkroom.\nCitric acid is an excellent soldering flux, either dry or as a concentrated solution in water. It should be removed after soldering, especially with fine wires, as it is mildly corrosive. It dissolves and rinses quickly in hot water.\nAlkali citrate can be used as an inhibitor of kidney stones by increasing urine citrate levels, useful for prevention of calcium stones, and increasing urine pH, useful for preventing uric acid and cystine stones.\nSynthesis of other organic compounds.\nCitric acid is a versatile precursor to many other organic compounds. Dehydration routes give itaconic acid and its anhydride. Citraconic acid can be produced via thermal isomerization of itaconic acid anhydride. The required itaconic acid anhydride is obtained by dry distillation of citric acid. Aconitic acid can be synthesized by dehydration of citric acid using sulfuric acid:\n(HO2CCH2)2C(OH)CO2H \u2192 HO2CCH=C(CO2H)CH2CO2H + H2O\nAcetonedicarboxylic acid can also be prepared by decarboxylation of citric acid in fuming sulfuric acid.\nSafety.\nAlthough a weak acid, exposure to pure citric acid can cause adverse effects. Inhalation may cause cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Over-ingestion may cause abdominal pain and sore throat. Exposure of concentrated solutions to skin and eyes can cause redness and pain. Long-term or repeated consumption may cause erosion of tooth enamel.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He had his breakthrough as a stand-up comic before gaining stardom for his film roles; he is widely recognized as one of the greatest comedians of all time. He has received several accolades including a Golden Globe Award, a Grammy Award, and an Emmy Award as well as nominations for an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award. He was honored with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2015 and the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2023.\nMurphy shot to fame on the sketch comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\", for which he was a regular cast member from 1980 to 1984 and broke out as a movie star in the 1980s films \"48 Hrs.\", \"Trading Places,\" and \"Beverly Hills Cop\". He then established himself as a leading man with starring roles in: \"The Golden Child\" (1986), \"Coming to America\" (1988), \"Harlem Nights\" (which he also directed) (1989), \"Boomerang\" (1992), \"The Nutty Professor\" (1996), 'Dr. Dolittle' (1997), \"Bowfinger\" (1999), \"Daddy Day Care\" (2003), and \"Norbit\" (2007). Murphy both won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in \"Dreamgirls\" (2006).\nMurphy has worked as a voice actor, including Mushu in Disney's \"Mulan\" (1998), Thurgood Stubbs in the sitcom \"The PJs\" (1999\u20132001), and Donkey in the \"Shrek\" franchise (2001\u2013present), the latter of which earned him a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. Murphy often takes on multiple roles in a single film, such as in \"Coming to America\", \"Vampire in Brooklyn\", the \"Nutty Professor\" films, \"Bowfinger\", \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" and \"Norbit.\" This is intended as Murphy's tribute to one of his idols, Peter Sellers. Following a string of poorly received films, he had a career resurgence with leading roles in films such as \"Dolemite Is My Name\" (2019), \"Coming 2 America\" (2021), \"You People\", \"Candy Cane Lane\" (both 2023) and \"\" (2024).\nIn 2020, he won his first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for hosting \"Saturday Night Live\". Murphy's films have grossed over $3.8\u00a0billion ($ adjusted for inflation) in the United States and Canada box office, and over $6.7\u00a0billion worldwide. In 2015, his films made him the sixth-highest grossing actor in the United States. As a singer, Murphy has released three studio albums, including \"How Could It Be\" (1985), \"So Happy\" (1989), and \"Love's Alright\" (1993). He is also known for his 1985 single \"Party All the Time\", which peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nEarly life.\nMurphy was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and raised in the borough's Bushwick neighborhood. His mother, Lillian Murphy (n\u00e9e Laney, later Murphy Lynch), was a telephone operator, and his father, Charles Edward Murphy (1940\u20131969), was a transit police officer and an amateur actor and comedian.\nHis father was murdered in 1969. Murphy later stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen Murphy's single mother became ill, eight-year-old Murphy and his elder brother Charlie (1959\u20132017) lived in foster care for one year. In interviews, Murphy has said his time in foster care was influential in developing his sense of humor. Later, he and his brother were raised in Roosevelt, New York, by his mother and stepfather Vernon Lynch, a foreman at an ice cream plant.\nCareer.\n1976\u20131980: Early standup career.\nWhen Murphy was fifteen, he listened to Richard Pryor's comedy album \"That Nigger's Crazy\", which inspired his decision to become a comedian. As a child, Murphy developed playing multiple characters in imitation of his acting hero, Peter Sellers. Other early influences included Bill Cosby, Redd Foxx, Robin Williams, Muhammad Ali, Bruce Lee, and Charlie Chaplin.\nOn July 9, 1976, the date with which Murphy marks the beginning of his career, he performed in a talent show at the Roosevelt Youth Center, doing an impersonation of singer Al Green as Green's song \"Let's Stay Together\" played. This led to work at other clubs within walking distance, and then late-night jobs at locations that required him to commute by train. To do this, he secretly skipped school, and after his mother discovered this at the end of his senior year, he was required to attend summer school.\n1980s: Superstar status and career peak.\nIn the early 1980s, Murphy first earned national attention as a cast member on \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\") and was credited with helping to revitalize the show. His characters included a grown-up version of the \"Little Rascals\" character Buckwheat; a streetwise children's show host named Mr. Robinson (parodying Fred Rogers, who found it amusing); and a morose, cynical Gumby, whose trademark slogan became an \"SNL\" catchphrase: \"I'm Gumby, dammit!\" According to Joseph Clokey, whose father Art Clokey created Gumby, both of them \"thought Eddie was a genius in the way he played that character\". The Buckwheat character was retired in spectacular fashion\u2014assassinated, on camera, in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza\u2014at Murphy's request, after he grew tired of constant demands from fans to \"Do Buckwheat! Do Buckwheat!\" In \"Rolling Stone\"'s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 \"SNL\" cast members to-date, Murphy was ranked second (behind John Belushi). \"It is customary (and accurate) to say that Eddie Murphy is the only reason \"SNL\" survived the five-year wilderness without Lorne Michaels\", the magazine noted. Murphy's early comedy was characterized by copious profanity and sketches lampooning a diverse group of people, including WASPs, African-Americans, Italian-Americans, overweight people, and gay people. He released two stand-up specials. \"Delirious\" was filmed in 1983 in Washington, D.C.\nDue to the popularity of \"Delirious\", his concert film, \"Eddie Murphy Raw\" (1987), received a wide theatrical release, grossing $50\u00a0million; the movie was filmed in the Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In 1982, Murphy made his big-screen debut in the film \"48 Hrs.\" with Nick Nolte. \"48 Hrs.\" proved to be a hit when it was released during the Christmas season of 1982. Nolte was scheduled to host the December 11, 1982, Christmas episode of \"Saturday Night Live\", but became too ill to host, so Murphy took over. He became the only cast member to host while still a regular. Murphy opened the show with the phrase, \"Live from New York, it's the Eddie Murphy Show!\" The following year, Murphy starred in \"Trading Places\" with \"SNL\" original cast member Dan Aykroyd. The movie marked the first of Murphy's collaborations with director John Landis, who would go on to direct Murphy in \"Coming to America\" (1988) and \"Beverly Hills Cop III\" (1994). \"Trading Places\" was an even greater box-office success than \"48 Hrs.\"\nMurphy appeared in \"Best Defense\" (1984), co-starring Dudley Moore. Credited as a \"Strategic Guest Star\", the former was added to the film after an original version was completed but tested poorly with audiences. \"Best Defense\" was both a major financial and critical disappointment. When he hosted \"SNL\", Murphy joined the chorus of those bashing \"Best Defense\", calling it \"the worst movie in the history of everything\". The same year, he won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording for his album '. (Murphy has been nominated for a total of three Grammy Awards.) Murphy starred in the successful action comedy film \"Beverly Hills Cop\" (1984). The film was Murphy's first solo leading role. \"Beverly Hills Cop\" grossed over $230\u00a0million at the U.S. box office, becoming the highest-grossing film released in 1984, the highest-grossing comedy of all time, and the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time; as of May\u00a02018[ [update]], it was 46th in the list of all-time U.S. box office grossers after adjusting for inflation (third-highest amongst R-rated films). Murphy chose to do that film instead of \"Ghostbusters\" (1984). Murphy was offered a part in ' (1986), a role that, after being heavily re-written from comic relief to love interest, ultimately went to Catherine Hicks. By this time, Murphy's near-exclusive contract with Paramount Pictures rivaled \"Star Trek\" as Paramount's most lucrative franchise.\nBy 1986, he launched Eddie Murphy Television Enterprises with a deal at Paramount Television. In his next subsequent role, he starred in the supernatural comedy \"The Golden Child\" (1986). Although \"The Golden Child\" performed well at the box office, the movie was not as well received as \"48 Hrs.\", \"Trading Places\", and \"Beverly Hills Cop\". \"The Golden Child\" was considered a change of pace for Murphy because of the supernatural setting as opposed to the \"street smart\" settings of his previous efforts. Not long afterward, he reprised his role of Axel Foley in the Tony Scott\u2013directed \"Beverly Hills Cop II\" (1987). It was a box-office success, grossing almost $300\u00a0million worldwide. By the end of the decade, Murphy was Hollywood's biggest box office star. At that time, Murphy was offered the lead role in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988) but he turned it down and later came to regret that decision explaining: \"(It) sounded ridiculous to me, and I passed on it. And afterwards, I was like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s fucking amazing.'\" In 1988, Murphy and his Eddie Murphy Television Enterprises company had struck a deal with CBS.\n1990\u20131998: Commercial decline and rebound.\nFrom 1989 onward, critical praise for Murphy's films declined; it hit a low point with the critically panned \"Beverly Hills Cop III\" (1994), a movie that Murphy denounced during an appearance on Inside the Actors Studio. Box-office receipts also declined compared to his previous films, although he did find some box office success with \"Another 48 Hrs.\" (1990) and \"Boomerang\" (1992). During this period, Murphy also starred in \"The Distinguished Gentleman\" (1992), a political comedy, and \"Vampire in Brooklyn\" (1995), a horror-comedy directed by Wes Craven. Though \"Vampire in Brooklyn\" was met with negative reviews upon release, it has since gained a cult following. On \"Harlem Nights\" (1989), Murphy worked as director, producer and star, as well as sharing co-writer duties with his brother, Charlie Murphy. The film featured Murphy's comic idols Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx in supporting roles.\nDuring this period, Murphy was criticized by filmmaker Spike Lee for not using his status to help Black actors break into film. However, as Murphy's prominence increased, his films (especially those he produced) often had a mainly Black cast (examples include \"Coming to America\", \"Harlem Nights\", \"Boomerang\", \"Vampire in Brooklyn\" and \"Life\"). Many Black actors who later received greater recognition made early appearances in Murphy's films, such as Damon Wayans in \"Beverly Hills Cop\", Halle Berry and Martin Lawrence in \"Boomerang\", Samuel L. Jackson and Cuba Gooding Jr. in \"Coming to America\", Dave Chappelle in \"The Nutty Professor\", and Chris Rock in \"Beverly Hills Cop II\". Naming \"The Nutty Professor\" as his favorite comedy, Rock regards Murphy's performance in the film as being so great, he had \"been robbed of an Oscar\", adding that his various performances were \"Peter Sellers\u2013esque\".\nAlthough Murphy owes his initial breakout success to \"Saturday Night Live\", he did not participate in the making of the \"Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live\" retrospective book by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller (2002), nor did he ever attend cast reunions or anniversary specials until his appearance on the \"SNL\" 40th anniversary special. Murphy told \"Rolling Stone\" he had distanced himself from the show because he was angry with David Spade over the latter's joke about Murphy's career during a segment on \"SNL\"; he was also angry with Lorne Michaels and the production staff for allowing the joke in the first place. Murphy and Spade have since reconciled.\n1998\u20132018: Family-friendly films, flops and \"Dreamgirls\".\nMurphy followed \"The Nutty Professor\" with a series of successful family-friendly movies like \"Mulan\" (1998), \"Dr. Dolittle\" (also 1998) and its 2001 sequel, the \"Shrek\" series, \"Daddy Day Care\" (2003), and \"The Haunted Mansion\" (also 2003), along with \"\" (2000). However, most of his movies meant for more adult audiences performed moderately; \"Metro\" (1997), \"I Spy\" (2002), and \"Showtime\" (2002) all grossed less than $40\u00a0million domestically, \"Holy Man\" (1998) performed poorly, grossing less than $13\u00a0million, and \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" (2002) is on record as one of the biggest financial failures all time, grossing just $7\u00a0million worldwide on a reported massive $110\u00a0million budget. An exception to this run of poorly received adult-themed films was the Frank Oz comedy \"Bowfinger\" (1999), also starring Steve Martin. The film garnered generally positive critical reviews and grossed $98\u00a0million at the box-office.\nMurphy starred in the motion picture version of the Broadway musical \"Dreamgirls\" (2006) as soul singer James \"Thunder\" Early. Murphy won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Broadcast Film Critics Association Award in that category. Several reviews for the film highlighted Murphy's performance while he received some pre-release Academy Awards buzz. Murphy was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor on January 23, 2007, but lost to Alan Arkin for his performance in \"Little Miss Sunshine\"\u2014it was speculated that one of the reasons Murphy lost out on winning the Academy Award was the negative reviews of his subsequent film \"Norbit\", released in early February 2007. Murphy notoriously exited the 79th Academy Awards as soon as Arkin was announced the winner. In 2007, Murphy was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\nMurphy co-starred in \"Tower Heist\" (2011), directed by Brett Ratner, alongside Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, and Casey Affleck. Murphy played a thief who joins a group of hardworking men who find out they have fallen victim to a wealthy businessman's Ponzi scheme, and conspire to rob his high-rise residence. It was reported in 2011 that Murphy would host the 84th Academy Awards in 2012. However, he dropped out of his hosting duties on November 9, 2011, in the wake of the Brett Ratner scandal. On March 8, 2014, it was announced that Murphy would team up with \"Boomerang\" co-star Halle Berry in a new film titled \"Miles and Me\". The film was also set to star Laurence Fishburne and was set to begin pre-production in 2014 from Paramount Pictures. No other word was released about the film or who else was attached. On March 15, 2015, it was announced that Murphy would play comedian Richard Pryor's father, LeRoy Pryor, in the upcoming biopic directed by Lee Daniels with Mike Epps playing Pryor; as of 2019, the project remains in development hell.\nIn February 2015, Murphy attended the \"Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special\" where Chris Rock introduced him in a special tribute dedicated to him. Murphy was greeted with an enthusiastic standing ovation from the crowd of comedians and stars, however he received criticism for his brief appearance, declining to tell any jokes, and for not reprising his iconic \"SNL\" characters. On October 15, 2015, Murphy was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Those who honored Murphy at the event included Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Trevor Noah, George Lopez, Kevin Nealon, Kathy Griffin, Tracy Morgan, Joe Piscopo, Jay Pharoah and Dick Gregory. Murphy co-starred with actress Britt Robertson in the drama \"Mr. Church\" (2016) for which he received critical acclaim.\n2019\u2013present: Career resurgence.\nIn October 2019, Murphy produced and starred in \"Dolemite Is My Name\" as Rudy Ray Moore. The film was distributed on Netflix and received overwhelming critical acclaim. The film holds a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes with the critics consensus reading, \"Eddie Murphy makes \"Dolemite Is My Name\" just as bold, brash, and ultimately hard to resist as its subject.\" For his work, Murphy received a Golden Globe Award nomination for the film.\nIn December 2019, Murphy returned to \"Saturday Night Live\" to promote \"Dolemite\"; this was his first time hosting since 1984. His hosting duties received overwhelming acclaim from audiences and critics alike, making it the highest watched episode since 2008 when Tina Fey played Sarah Palin. Comedians Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan, and Kenan Thompson welcomed Murphy back in the opening monologue. Murphy went on to reprise his popular \"SNL\" characters such as Mr. Robinson, Gumby, Buckwheat, and Velvet Jones. Murphy won his first ever Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for hosting the episode. Murphy and most of the cast reprised their roles in the \"Coming to America\" sequel \"Coming2 America\", which was released in March 2021.\nOn December 6, 2013, it was announced that Murphy would star in the of the \"Beverly Hills Cop\" series. Brett Ratner was at the time set to direct the film, Jerry Bruckheimer was confirmed to produce the film, and Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec would write. In a June 2014 interview, Murphy discussed the plot of the film, saying it would take place and film in Detroit, bringing in an estimated $56.6\u00a0million to the state of Michigan. On June 14, 2016, it was confirmed that Murphy was still set to reprise his role as Axel Foley in a fourth film. In December 2019, it was reported that the film had moved to Netflix, where \"\", which was ultimately directed by Mark Molloy, was released on July 3, 2024.\nIn September 2021, Murphy and his Eddie Murphy Productions company signed a deal with Amazon Studios. On March 31, 2022, it was announced that Murphy will portray George Clinton in an untitled biopic, with John Davis and Catherine Davis producing through Davis Entertainment.\nIn June 2024, Murphy and Bruckheimer revealed that a fifth \"Beverly Hills Cop\" film was already in development. Murphy will reprise his role as Donkey in \"Shrek 5\", set for release on June 30, 2027.\nSinging career.\nMurphy is also a singer, having frequently provided background vocals to songs released by the Bus Boys; the song \"(The Boys Are) Back in Town\" was featured in \"48 Hrs.\" and Murphy's comedy special \"Eddie Murphy Delirious\". As a solo artist, Murphy had two hit singles, \"Party All the Time\" (produced by Rick James) and \"Put Your Mouth on Me\", during the latter half of the 1980s. He had started singing earlier in his career, with the songs \"Boogie in Your Butt\" and \"Enough Is Enough\", the latter being a parody of Barbra Streisand's and Donna Summer's 1979 song, \"No More Tears\". Both songs appeared on his 1982 self-titled comedy album. \"Party All the Time\" was featured on Murphy's debut album \"How Could It Be\" (1985), which included a minor follow-up R&amp;B hit in the title track, a duet with vocalist Crystal Blake. This track was written by Rusty Hamilton and was produced by Stevie Wonder's cousin Aquil Fudge after a brief falling out with Rick James. In 2004, VH-1 and \"Blender\" voted \"Party All the Time\" number seven among the \"50 Worst Songs of All-Time\". Sharam used a sample of the song for the UK No.8 hit \"PATT (Party All the Time)\" in 2006. \"Put Your Mouth on Me\" appeared on Murphy's 1989 follow-up album, \"So Happy\".\nMurphy recorded the album \"Love's Alright\" in the early 1990s. He performed in a music video of the single \"Whatzupwitu\", featuring Michael Jackson. He recorded a duet with Shabba Ranks called \"I Was a King\". In 1992, Murphy appeared in the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Remember the Time\" alongside Magic Johnson and Iman. Though uncredited, Murphy provided vocal work on \"SNL\" castmate Joe Piscopo's 1985 comedy single, \"The Honeymooners Rap\". Piscopo impersonated Jackie Gleason on the single, while Murphy provided an imitation of Art Carney. In \"Coming to America\", he imitated Jackie Wilson when he sang \"To Be Loved\", but because the character he was playing had a thick accent, he had to sing it in character; he also performed in the same film as the character Randy Watson, a small time club singer, a role he reprised in the 2021 sequel \"Coming 2 America\".\nMurphy performed several songs in the \"Shrek\" film franchise. In the first film, he performed a version of the Monkees' \"I'm a Believer\" in the film's final scene; in \"Shrek 2\", he performed Ricky Martin's hit \"Livin' La Vida Loca\", along with co-star Antonio Banderas; Murphy performed \"Thank You (Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Again)\" for \"Shrek the Third\", once again with Banderas. In 2013, he released his first single in many years titled \"Red Light\", a reggae song featuring Snoop Dogg. He was also working on a new album titled \"9\", but it was never released.\nInfluences.\nMurphy has cited as influences Richard Pryor, Elvis Presley, Muhammad Ali and Bruce Lee. Murphy was inspired by Pryor's taboo approach to comedy and did perfect impersonations of Presley, who he used as a model for what a star could be. Despite also emulating Bill Cosby\u2019s storytelling approach in his act, Cosby would criticize Murphy's use of profanity, with Murphy also holding more hostile feelings towards Cosby by the early 1980s. Comedians who cite Murphy as influencing them include Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and Russell Brand.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and children.\nMurphy had two sons at the end of the 1980s: Eric (born July 10, 1989) with then-girlfriend Paulette McNeely; and Christian (born November 29, 1990), with then-girlfriend Tamara Hood.\nMurphy began a longtime romantic relationship with Nicole Mitchell after meeting her in 1988 at an NAACP Image Awards show. They lived together for almost two years before getting married at the Grand Ballroom of the Plaza Hotel in New York City on March 18, 1993. Murphy and Mitchell have five children together: Bria (born November 18, 1989), Myles Mitchell (born November 7, 1992), Shayne Audra (born October 10, 1994), Zola Ivy (born December 24, 1999), and Bella Zahra (born January 29, 2002). In August 2005, Mitchell filed for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\". The divorce was finalized on April 17, 2006.\nFollowing his divorce from Mitchell, in 2006, Murphy began dating former Spice Girl Melanie Brown, who became pregnant and claimed the child was Murphy's. When questioned about the pregnancy in December 2006, by \"RTL Boulevard\", Murphy told Dutch reporter Matthijs Kleyn, \"I don't know whose child that is until it comes out and has a blood test. You shouldn't jump to conclusions, sir.\" Brown gave birth to Angel Iris Murphy Brown, on Murphy's 46th birthday, April 3, 2007. On June 22, 2007, representatives for Brown announced that a DNA test had confirmed Murphy was the child's father. Brown had stated in an interview that Murphy has not sought a relationship with Angel, although it was later reported in 2010 that Murphy was becoming a more involved father.\nMurphy exchanged vows with film producer Tracey Edmonds, former wife of Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, on January 1, 2008, in a private ceremony on an island off Bora Bora. On January 16, 2008, the couple released a statement describing the ceremony as a symbolic union: \"After much consideration and discussion, we have jointly decided that we will forgo having a legal ceremony as it is not necessary to define our relationship further\" and that they would remain friends instead of pursuing a further romantic relationship. Murphy bought property on Long Island, New York, later that year.\nOn May 3, 2016, Murphy had a daughter Izzy Oona by Australian model Paige Butcher, whom he had been dating since 2012. Murphy and Butcher are also parents of a son, Max Charles, born in November 30, 2018. In September 2018 they became engaged to be married. Their son's middle name pays tribute to Murphy's late brother, Charlie, who died of leukemia in 2017. In July 2024, they married in a private ceremony in Anguilla.\nIn May 2025, Murphy's son Eric married Jasmine Lawrence, daughter of fellow entertainer Martin Lawrence.\nContrary to claims of Bill Cosby having a major influence on Murphy, it is acknowledged that Murphy has in fact long had a tense relationship with Cosby. In a 2019 episode of \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\", Murphy revealed to Jerry Seinfeld that he began having a tense relationship with Cosby after Cosby was highly negative towards him when the two met in 1981 and that his Cosby parodies which he began doing in the 1980s in fact reflected his real life animosity towards Cosby.\nPhilanthropy.\nMurphy has donated money to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, as well as cancer, education, creative arts, family support, health, and homeless charities. He has donated to the Martin Luther King Jr. Center, and $100,000 to the Screen Actors' Guild's strike relief fund.\nMurphy has paid for the funerals of several friends such as Redd Foxx and Rick James, and purchased a tombstone for the previously unmarked graves of Billie \"Buckwheat\" Thomas and Tim Moore, but does not attend funerals, having only attended two - those of his father and stepfather - and finding them emotionally overwhelming. His plan for himself is direct cremation with no funeral or memorial service.\nReligious beliefs.\nMurphy was baptized Catholic. It was reported in a 2011 issue of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine that Murphy remarked, \"... I don't want to have no religion. I have Christian-based values and beliefs.\"\nEddie Murphy Rule.\nSection 746 of the 2010 US Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits securities trading based on non-public information misappropriated from a government source, is informally known as the \"Eddie Murphy Rule\". The term relates to the plot in the 1984 film \"Trading Places\" where illegally acquired market information was doctored and used (albeit not illegally in 1984) to short sell frozen orange juice concentrate.\nProstitute incident.\nOn May 2, 1997, Murphy was stopped by police in West Hollywood, California, at 4:45\u00a0a.m. with Atisone Seiuli, a transgender prostitute, in his car. His publicist, Paul Block, denied that Murphy had intended to pay Seiuli for sex, saying that Murphy was only giving her a ride home. Murphy was not charged with any crime, though Seiuli had to spend 90 days in the LA County jail, but the incident caused him a number of public relation problems.\nFilmography.\nSelected filmography:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAwards and nominations.\nMurphy has received numerous accolades including a Emmy Award, a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

Blaustein, and starring Murphy (in various roles), Arsenio Hall (also in various roles), James Earl Jones, John Amos, Madge Sinclair, and Shari Headley. It tells the story of Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African nation of Zamunda who travels to the United States in the hopes of finding a woman he can marry and will love him for who he is, not for his status or for having been trained to please him. The film was released in the United States on June 29, 1988, and received generally positive reviews from critics. It was also a box-office success, grossing an estimated $288.8\u2013$350 million on a $36 million budget.\nIn 1989, a pilot for a planned spin-off television series was made, although this was never picked up for a series. A sequel to the film\u2014\"Coming 2 America\"\u2014was released on March 4, 2021.\nPlot.\nIn the wealthy African nation of Zamunda, crown prince Akeem Joffer grows weary of his pampered lifestyle on his 21st birthday and wishes to do more for himself. When his parents King Jaffe and Queen Aoleon present him with an arranged bride-to-be, Akeem takes action. Seeking an independent woman who loves him for himself and not his social status, Akeem and his best friend/personal aide Semmi travel to the New York City borough of Queens and rent a squalid tenement in the neighborhood of Jackson Heights under the guise of poor foreign students.\nBeginning their search for Akeem's bride, they are invited by local barber shop owner Clarence to a rally raising money for the neighborhood. During the rally, Akeem encounters Lisa McDowell who possesses all the qualities he is looking for in a woman. Upon his insistence, he and Semmi get entry-level jobs working at the local fast-food restaurant called McDowell's, a McDonald's knockoff owned by Lisa's widowed father Cleo McDowell.\nAkeem's attempts to win Lisa's love are complicated by Lisa's lazy and obnoxious boyfriend Darryl Jenks whose father owns Soul Glo (a Jheri curl\u2013like hairstyling aid). After Darryl announces their engagement\u2014without Lisa's consent\u2014to their families, she starts dating Akeem who claims that he comes from a family of poor goat herders.\nAlthough Akeem thrives on hard work and learning how commoners live, Semmi is not comfortable with living in such meager conditions. After a dinner date with Lisa is thwarted when Semmi furnishes their apartment with a hot tub and other luxuries, Akeem confiscates his money and donates it to a homeless Mortimer and Randolph Duke. Semmi wires a telegraph to King Jaffe for more money, prompting the Joffers to travel to Queens to find him.\nCleo initially disapproves of Akeem as he believes he is poor and therefore not good enough for his daughter. He becomes ecstatic when he discovers that Akeem is actually an extremely wealthy prince, after meeting his parents. When Akeem discovers that his parents have arrived in New York, he and Lisa go to the McDowell residence in Jamaica Estates to lie low and Cleo welcomes them while driving away Darryl. After Cleo's bond with Akeem is ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Zamundan entourage, Lisa later becomes angry and confused that Akeem lied to her about his identity. Akeem explains that he wanted her to love him for who, not what, he is, even offering to renounce his throne. Still hurt and angry, Lisa refuses to marry him. Despondent, Akeem resigns himself to the arranged marriage. As they leave, Aoleon reprimands Jaffe for clinging to outdated traditions instead of thinking of their son's happiness.\nAt the wedding procession, a still-heartbroken Akeem becomes surprised when his veiled bride is Lisa herself as Cleo also comes out. Following the ceremony, they ride happily in a carriage to the cheers of Zamundans. Witnessing such splendor, Lisa is both surprised and touched by the fact that Akeem would have given it up just for her. Akeem offers again to abdicate if she does not want this life, but Lisa playfully declines.\nCast.\nThe cast also includes: Vondie Curtis-Hall as a basketball game vendor who recognizes Akeem; Garcelle Beauvais, Feather, and Stephanie Simon as the royal rose bearers; Victoria Dillard as a royal personal bather; Elaine Kagan as a telegraph lady who wires Semmi's message for more money to King Joffer; as well as the film debuts of Ruben Hudson as a street hustler, and Cuba Gooding Jr. as a boy getting a haircut at the time when Akeem and Semmi arrive in Queens.\nDon Ameche and Ralph Bellamy reprise their roles as Mortimer and Randolph Duke respectively from Landis's Murphy-starring comedy film \"Trading Places\" (1983) who have become homeless after the events of the film and receive money from Akeem. A segment of the \"Trading Places\" score can be heard during their scene.\nAs previously indicated, \"Coming to America\" features Murphy and Hall in several different roles, of different races and genders. Following the success of this film, this became a Murphy staple, as seen in four later films: \"Vampire in Brooklyn\" (1995); \"The Nutty Professor\" (1996) and (2000); and \"Norbit\" (2007).\nProduction.\n\"Coming to America\" reunited star Eddie Murphy with director John Landis. The two men had previously worked together on the comedy hit \"Trading Places\". Landis recalled the differences in working with Murphy on the two movies: \"The guy on \"Trading Places\" was young and full of energy and curious and funny and fresh and great. The guy on \"Coming to America\" was the pig of the world... But I still think he's wonderful in the movie.\" Murphy said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We had a tussling confrontation\u2026 We didn't come to blows. Personalities didn't mesh. ... He directed me in \"Trading Places\" when I was just starting out as a kid, but he was still treating me like a kid five years later during \"Coming to America\". And I \"hired\" him to direct the movie! I was gonna direct \"Coming to America\" myself, but I knew that Landis had just done three fucked-up pictures in a row and that his career was hanging by a thread after the \"Twilight Zone\" trial. I figured the guy was nice to me when I did \"Trading Places\", so I'd give him a shot\u2026 I was going out of my way to help this guy, and he fucked me over. Now he's got a hit picture on his resum\u00e9, a movie that made over $200 million, as opposed to him coming off a couple of fucked-up movies \u2013 which is where I'd rather see him be right now.\nDespite the experience, Landis and Murphy collaborated again six years later on \"Beverly Hills Cop III\".\nSouth African chorus Ladysmith Black Mambazo sings \"Mbube\" during the opening sequence (the song also known as \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\"). The group has since recorded several different versions of \"Mbube;\" however, the version heard in \"Coming to America\" had not been released on its soundtrack or on CD as of 2006. A promotional song for the film, also titled \"Coming to America\", was written and performed by The System.\nMurphy received a personal salary of $8 million for his work on the film, plus 15% of film rentals. Landis received $600,000, plus 10% of gross receipts. Landis's calling card (\"See You Next Wednesday\") appears as an \"easter egg\" within the film, on a science-fiction movie poster in the subway station after Lisa storms off the train.\nRelease.\nParamount cancelled press screenings of the film after initial negative reactions to a press screening in New York City.\nBox office.\nReleased on June 29, 1988, by Paramount Pictures in the United States, it was a commercial box-office success, both domestically and worldwide. The film debuted at number one with $21,404,420 from 2,064 screens, for a five-day total of $28,409,497. The film made $128,152,301 in the United States and ended up with a worldwide total of $288,752,301. It was the highest earning film that year for the studio and the third-highest-grossing film at the United States box office.\nIt opened a month later in the UK and earned $7,712,622 during its seven-week run. It opened on September 2 in West Germany, where it debuted at number one with $3,715,791 from 297 screens. It ended its run after 13 weeks with $15,743,447. Several contemporary articles stated that the worldwide gross of the movie was $350 million.\nReception.\n\"Coming To America\" received positive reviews upon release.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Eddie Murphy was in full control at this point, starkly evident in \"Coming to America\"'s John Landis' coasting direction.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 47 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\nSheila Benson in the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it a \"hollow and wearying Eddie Murphy fairy tale\" and bemoans, \"That an Eddie Murphy movie would come to this.\" Vincent Canby in \"The New York Times\" was also critical of the writing, calling it a \"possibly funny idea\" but suggesting the screenplay had escaped before it was ready. Canby viewed the film as essentially a romantic comedy but said the romantic elements fell flat, and the film instead goes for broad slapstick. Kathleen Carroll of the \"New York Daily News\" called the film \"an adorably amusing upscale fairy tale, an endearingly romantic comedy which has all the fabulous fake opulence of an old-fashioned Hollywood musical as well as the traditionally sappy happy ending.\" Siskel &amp; Ebert had mixed opinions on the film. Siskel enjoyed the acting from Murphy and Hall but Ebert was disappointed that Murphy did not bring his usual more lively performance, and Ebert was also critical of the unoriginal script. Siskel, in print, reviewed the film more enthusiastically, giving it three and a half stars out of four, and describing it as \"a sweet, oft-told story\", adding that \"Murphy and Hall add a number of very sharp supporting roles hidden by makeup to add spice to the general level of gentleness.\" However, in 2016, in an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Eddie Murphy made a comment regarding the negative reviews of his work, saying: \"Oh, they have no effect on me at all. I haven\u2019t read a review in, easily, 20, 25 years. I used to. I remember when \u201cComing to America\u201d came out, Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs way down, saying it sucked. Then 10, 15 years later, I remember seeing them do a retrospective and they were both, \u201cThe \"classic\" \u2018Coming to America\u2019 blah blah blah.\u2019 The shelf life of movies changes over the years.\"\nAwards.\nThe film was nominated for two Oscars: Best Costume Design for Deborah Nadoolman Landis and Best Makeup for Rick Baker, who designed the makeup effects for both Murphy's and Arsenio Hall's multiple supporting characters.\nLawsuit.\nThe film was the subject of the \"Buchwald v. Paramount\" civil suit, which the humorist Art Buchwald filed in 1990 against the film's producers on the grounds that the film's idea was stolen from his 1982 script treatment about a rich, despotic African potentate who comes to America for a state visit. Paramount had optioned the treatment from Buchwald, and John Landis was attached as director and Eddie Murphy as the lead, but after two years of development hell Paramount abandoned the project in March 1985. In 1987, Paramount began working on \"Coming to America\" based on a story by Eddie Murphy. Buchwald won the breach of contract action and the court ordered monetary damages. The parties later settled the case out of court before an appeal could go to trial.\nIn August 2022, Paramount filed a lawsuit against JMC Pop Ups LLC for creating a temporary version of McDowell's, the fictional fast food restaurant similar to McDonald's, via the Copyright Claims Board, a tribunal created in 2020 to deal with such matters. The pop up restaurant had operated in Springfield, Virginia, and Cherry Hill, New Jersey, in 2022, prior to the suit. McDowell's was featured in both the original movie and its sequel.\nHome media.\n\"Coming to America\" was released on DVD on June 3, 2008. The Film was released on Blu-Ray on June 3, 2008, and re-released on Blu-Ray on January 1, 2013, and on June 12, 2018. \"Coming To America\" was released on 4K Blu-Ray on December 1, 2020.\nSoundtrack.\nThe soundtrack to the film was released on LP, cassette and CD. The songs \"Coming to America\" by The System, \"Better Late Than Never\" by The Cover Girls and \"Come into My Life\" by Laura Branigan and Joe Esposito were released as singles from the album. \"That's The Way It Is\" by Mel &amp; Kim had been released as a single in the UK, before the film's release, in February 1988, and became a top ten hit. It was released as a single in the US at the time of the film's release.\nSide A\nSide B\nSoul Glo jingle.\nThe jingle for the commercial for the fictional product Soul Glo was composed by Nile Rodgers, who has suggested it is his \"proudest moment\". Vocals were provided by Christopher Max.\nLegacy.\nTelevision pilot.\nA television pilot of a weekly sitcom version of the film was produced for CBS, following the film's success, starring Tommy Davidson as Prince Tariq, and Paul Bates reprising his role as Oha. The pilot went unsold, but was televised on July 4, 1989, as part of the \"CBS Summer Playhouse\" pilot anthology series.\nRemakes.\nA Tamil film, \"My Dear Marthandan\", was produced based on the plot of \"Coming to America\". A Hong Kong film, \"The Fun, the Luck &amp; the Tycoon\", also has the same plot.\nInfluences in music.\nThe melody heard in the bathroom scene, where Prince Akeem is being washed by female servants, was sampled in Snoop Dogg's 2006 song \"That's That\" featuring R. Kelly; a remix of the song featuring American rapper Nas includes a woman's voice saying \"the royal penis is clean, Your Highness\", a line taken from the same scene. The supergroup The Randy Watson Experience is named after the character Randy Watson.\nCultural impact.\nThe movie has been described as having a \"cult following\" years after its release, despite negative press, with one of the highest-grossing box office of the year it was released, as well as one of the highest-grossing films featuring a predominantly African-American cast.\nSequel.\nIn early 2017, an announcement was publicized which addressed the impending production of a sequel to the film. Kevin Misher was named as producer, and Sheffield and Blaustein, the original screenwriters, were also attached to the project. However, the participation of lead actors Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall was left undefined.\nOn January 11, 2019, it was announced that the sequel was moving forward with Murphy reprising his role and Craig Brewer as director (having previously worked with Murphy on the Netflix film \"Dolemite Is My Name\"). Arsenio Hall, Shari Headley, John Amos, Paul Bates and James Earl Jones returning for the sequel as well. Wesley Snipes signed on for a role in the film. It was reported that Leslie Jones and American rapper Rick Ross were joining the cast in undisclosed roles.\nThe film was scheduled to be theatrically released on December 18, 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon Studios bought the distribution rights and released it digitally on Amazon Prime Video on March 4, 2021.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Only 51 cars were made including their prototype before the company was forced to cease all operations on March 3, 1949, due to negative publicity initiated by the news media, a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and a heavily publicized stock fraud trial (in which the allegations were proven baseless and led to a full acquittal). Tucker suspected that the Big Three automakers and Michigan Senator Homer S. Ferguson had a role in the Tucker Corporation's demise.\nThe 48's original proposed price was said to be $1,000, but the actual selling price was closer to $4,000.\nThe 1988 movie \"\" is based on the saga surrounding the car's production. The film's director, Francis Ford Coppola, is a Tucker owner and displays his vehicle on the grounds of his winery.\nThe Tucker 48 is often referred to as the Tucker Torpedo. However, the Torpedo was actually a prototype, and the name was never used for the production model, which was officially called the \"Tucker 48\".\nDevelopment.\nAfter World War II, the public was ready for new car designs, but the Big Three Detroit automakers had not developed any new models since 1941 because their resources had been diverted towards producing war materiel. This provided opportunities for new, small automakers which could develop new cars faster than the huge legacy automakers. Studebaker was the first to introduce an all-new postwar model series in the ponton style which had just gone mainstream, but Tucker took a different track, designing a safe car with innovative features and modern styling. His specifications called for a water-cooled aluminum block flat-6 rear engine, disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, fuel injection, the location of all instruments within reach of the steering wheel, seat belts and a padded dashboard.\nBefore the war's end, Preston Tucker began working on plans for his new automobile. In the summer of 1944, he hired noted car designer George S. Lawson to style his new automobile. Lawson worked on the project for over a year and a half before his design debuted publicly, beginning about February 1946 and found as late as a year later in March 1947. Lawson was named the Tucker Corporation's \"chief stylist\" in February 1946, immediately upon the company's formation.\nIn December 1946, Lawson resigned from the company after a disagreement with Preston Tucker, and shortly thereafter, stylist Alex Tremulis of local Chicago design firm Tammen &amp; Denison was hired and furthered the development of the Lawson design. Tucker gave Tammen &amp; Denison and Tremulis a three-month contract, which expired in March 1947 and was not renewed. The culmination of Tremulis' efforts during this phase of design development was featured in a full-page advertisement run in numerous national newspapers in March 1947. Tremulis' design was based directly upon the work of George Lawson, but incorporated his own artistic flair.\nSimultaneous with Tremulis' departure, Preston Tucker hired a team of five designers (Read Viemeister, Budd Steinhilber, Tucker Madawick, Hal Bergstrom and Phillip Egan) from the New York design firm J. Gordon Lippincott, who updated Tremulis' design just as Tremulis had done with Lawson's.\nAfter a month's absence, Tremulis was rehired and the two independent design groups developed full-size clay models side by side in direct competition. Surviving photographs of the two models reveal that Tremulis' clay design remained unchanged from his March 1947 advertisement proposal and was not chosen for production. The passenger side of the Lippincott team's clay model (they submitted two designs), which incorporated the side profile developed by Tremulis prior to their arrival, was chosen virtually intact for the production automobile's styling.\nThe Tucker 48's evolving appearance in the company's press releases and other promotional materials, combined with suggestive statements such as \"15 years of testing produced the car of the year\"\u2014despite no running prototype existing \"at the time\"\u2014were instrumental in the SEC filing mail and conspiracy fraud charges against Preston Tucker. The SEC, however, failed to prove its case, and Tucker was acquitted of all charges in January 1950. However, the company never recovered.\nTremulis, like George Lawson, was eventually named the Tucker Corporation's \"chief stylist\", although the first reference to him holding this position does not appear until 1948, after the Tucker 48's exterior styling was completed.\nThe Tucker automobile was originally named the \"Torpedo\", but was changed to \"Tucker '48\" around the time of Lawson's departure and Tremulis' arrival, reportedly because Tucker did not want to remind the public of the horrors of World War II. Despite the name change, the Tucker 48 is still often referred to as the Tucker Torpedo. Alex Tremulis has claimed responsibility for dubbing the first prototype automobile the \"Tin Goose\", a name which is presently used in an affectionate manner but at the time was considered derogatory.\nInnovative design features.\nThe Tucker was a pioneer in terms of engineering and safety features. A rear engine, rear wheel drive configuration had been employed in Tatras and Volkswagens, and headlamps that turned with the front wheels had been available since the 1920s, but they would have been firsts for a modern American production car. The most recognizable feature of the Tucker 48, was a third directional headlamp. Centrally located, it would activate at steering angles of greater than 10 degrees to light the car's path around corners. At the time, 17 states had laws against cars having more than two headlights. Tucker fabricated a cover for the center light for use in these states.\nThe car had a rear engine and rear-wheel drive. A perimeter frame surrounded the vehicle for crash protection, as well as a roll bar integrated into the roof. The steering box was behind the front axle to protect the driver in a front-end accident. The instrument panel and all controls were within easy reach of the steering wheel, and the dashboard was padded for safety. The windshield was made of shatterproof glass and designed to pop out in a collision to protect occupants. The car's parking brake had a separate key so it could be locked in place to prevent theft. The doors extended into the roof, to ease entry and exit. Each Tucker that was built differed somewhat from the previous car, as each car built was basically a \"prototype\" where design features and engineering concepts were tried, improved, or discarded throughout the production cycle. The door releases on the interior of the Tucker came from the Lincoln Zephyr. The steering columns used in the Tucker were donated by Ford and are from the 1941 Lincoln. Preston Tucker held a patent for a collapsible steering column design. A glove box was added to the front door panels instead of the more conventional location in the dashboard to provide space for the \"crash chamber\" that the Tucker is now famous for. This is a padded area ahead of the passenger seat, free from obstructions, providing the front seat passengers an area to protect themselves in the event of an accident. The engine and transmission were mounted on a separate subframe which was secured with only six bolts. The entire drive train could thus be lowered and removed from the car in minutes. Tucker envisioned loaner engines being quickly swapped in for service in just 30 minutes.\nTucker envisioned several other innovations that were later abandoned. Magnesium wheels, disc brakes, fuel injection, self-sealing tubeless tires, and a direct-drive torque converter transmission were all evaluated or tested, but were dropped on the final prototype due to cost, engineering complexity, and lack of time to develop.\nTucker initially tried to develop an innovative engine, with help from Ben Parsons, then owner and president of the Fuelcharger Corporation, and would later be Tucker's VP of engineering. It was a flat-6 cylinder with hemispherical combustion chambers, fuel injection, and overhead valves operated by oil pressure rather than a camshaft. An oil pressure distributor was mounted in line with the ignition distributor and delivered appropriately timed direct oil pressure to open each valve at proper intervals. The oil pressure fed to each valve was \"timed\" by intake and exhaust eccentrics and measured by spring-loaded plungers. It had large pistons built of aluminum and magnesium castings with steel-plated cylinder linings. This unique engine was designed to idle at 100\u00a0rpm and cruise at 250\u20131200\u00a0rpm through the use of direct-drive torque converters on each driving wheel instead of a transmission. It was designed to produce almost and of torque at only 1800\u00a0rpm. When cruising at , it would only turn at approximately 1000\u00a0rpm. These features would have been auto industry firsts in 1948, but as engine development proceeded, problems appeared. Six prototypes of the 589 engine were built, but it was installed only in the test chassis and the first prototype.\nTroubled premiere.\nThe world premiere of the much-hyped Tucker 48 car was set for June 19, 1947. Over 3,000 people showed up at the factory in Chicago for lunch, a train tour of the plant, and the unveiling of the first prototype. The unveiling appeared doomed, however, as last-minute problems cropped up. The night before the premiere, two of the prototype's independent suspension arms snapped under the car's weight. (The prototype was extremely heavy, much heavier than the other 48s.) Minor engine problems were fixed, and the car was presentable by the time of the premiere. However, the experimental 589 engine was extremely loud. Tucker told the band to play as loud as possible to drown out the noise. Additionally the high-voltage starter required the use of outside power to get the engine started, so Tucker had the engineering team keep the engine running during the entire event, fearing that the public would see how much effort was required to get the engine started. As the car was driven on to the platform, the liquid coolant boiled over and some steam escaped from the car, but no one seemed to notice.\nDrew Pearson, one of the top newspaper columnists of his time, reported publicly that the car was a fraud because it could not go backward and it went \"goose-geese\" going down the road. Although this problem was limited to the first prototype only, a symptom of the speed with which the first car was put together, the damage to the car's reputation was done, and a storm of negative media followed.\nTucker suffered another setback when his bids to obtain two steel mills to provide raw materials for his cars were rejected by the War Assets Administration under a shroud of questionable politics.\nContinued development.\nEngine.\nTucker had promised , but his innovative engine was not working out. The valve train proved problematic and the engine only produced approximately . The high oil pressure required a 24-volt electrical system, up to 60 volts to get it started, and a long cranking time at start-up. Additionally, the oil pressure required to maintain valve function was not achieved until the engine was turning at higher engine speeds and Tucker's engineers struggled with keeping the valve train working at idle and lower engine speeds. Having wasted nearly a year trying to make the 589 work, Tucker started looking for alternatives.\nThe company first tried the Lycoming aircraft engine, but it would not fit in the car's rear engine compartment.\nAn air-cooled flat-6 engine, the Franklin O-335 made by Air Cooled Motors (and originally intended for the Bell 47), fit, and its pleased Tucker. He purchased four samples for $5,000 each, and his engineers converted the engine to water cooling (a decision that has puzzled historians ever since). The Franklin engine was heavily modified by Tucker's engineers, including Eddie Offutt and Tucker's son Preston, Jr. at his Ypsilanti machine shop. Using an aircraft engine in an automotive application required significant modification; thus, very few parts of the original Franklin engine were retained in the final Tucker engine. This durable modification of the engine was tested at maximum power for 150 hours, the equivalent of , at full throttle.\nTucker quickly bought Air Cooled Motors for $1.8 million to secure the engine source, then canceled all of the company's aircraft contracts so its resources could be focused on making automotive engines. This was a significant decision, since at the time of Tucker's purchase, Air Cooled Motors held over 65% of post-war U.S. aviation engine production contracts. The loss of income was substantial.\nTransmission.\nWith the horizontal, between-the-wheels 589 motor and its double torque converter(s) (and no reverse) drive system out, Tucker now needed a transmission to mate with the Franklin O-335. This motor was also horizontal, but its driveshaft pointed towards the front of the car. It was discovered, after a few sketches were made, that it was theoretically possible to adapt a previous transmission design intended for front-engine/front wheel drive use. This transmission served as a temporary \"fix\" for a very real problem for the success of the Tucker.\nPre-Selector manual transmission.\nIt was discovered that the front-wheel-drive Cord 810/812's Auburn Gear, 4-speed transmission, with the Bendix \"Electric Hand\" electro-vacuum shifting mechanism, fit the immediate design requirements needed to get the cars built and on the road until a future, automatic in-house transmission was available. This transmission was originally designed to sit behind a standard V8 engine, pointing towards the driven front wheels of the car. However, this transmission had a poor reputation following its original use in the Cord 810: In 1936, when the Cord 810 made its debut at the New York Automobile show, the transmissions were so problematic that they were mostly shown without any transmission installed. Problems abounded until the last Cord was produced in 1937.\nThe Cord transmissions, even with refurbishing, were initially inadequate for the power and torque of the O-335 engine. They lacked adequate lubrication and the main shaft was so long that it warped under load (causing gears to pop out of play), and the gear-teeth were quite weak. Nevertheless, this transmission worked well enough for the Tucker: it provided an adequate (albeit fragile) transmission, with a reverse gear. The company sent several of its staff, including Preston Tucker Jr., on a campaign to buy used Cord transmissions for reconditioning; a total of 22 used transmissions were acquired from junkyards and used car dealers. These transmissions were taken to the Ypsilanti Machine And Tool Company to be refurbished, mated to the O-335 engine and found to work. It was consequently decided that the 12-year old Cord design would become the standard manual transmission for the 1948 and subsequent Tucker automobiles. Since the Y-1 transmission was not yet available, 18 of the 22 Cord transmissions were deemed usable and were installed in production Tucker vehicles. Several of the cars have survived with Cord transmissions.\nYpsilanti Y-1 transmission.\nYpsilanti Machine and Tool Company, which was tapped to recondition the Cord units, began immediately redesigning the transmission for mass production for Tucker. This new design, which had few similar parts to the Cord transmission, still used the same basic indirect transmission design, but had all new gearing, shafts and electro-vacuum controls. Tucker and his engineers modified it, installing stronger gears and lengthening the case. The modified Cord transmission was named the Tucker Y-1 (Ypsilanti-1) and was installed in a few Tuckers. Both also used a Bendix designed electric vacuum shift mechanism with no mechanical linkage to the steering column shift lever. These EVS's had problems of their own with electrical connections and vacuum leaks that hindered shifting, so a new fully mechanical shift design would have been needed, had the Tucker made it into 1949.\nTuckermatic drive.\nTo solve the transmission problems with a new final transmission design, Warren Rice, creator of the Buick Dynaflow transmission, was consulted. A unique continuously variable transmission called the \"Tuckermatic\" was designed, which was strong enough to handle the Franklin O-335's power and torque. It was a simple but effective design with a single, rear-mounted torque converter and only 27 basic moving parts which was about 90 fewer than normally required for a contemporary automatic. The variable pitch torque converter allowed a continuously variable drive ratio with two forward gears and one reverse gear. \nThe only surviving car with a Tuckermatic installed had a standard column shift lever, with a three position quadrant on the steering column. Up was reverse, the middle was neutral, and down was drive. Due to the Tuckermatic's design, no lower gear selections were necessary, hence there was no need for a multi gated selector like other automatics.\nThree versions of the Tuckermatic were made: the R-1, R-1-2, and R-3 (R for Warren Rice, its designer). The first version, the R-1, was not installed on any of the final cars. It required the engine to be off in order to select a gear. The R-1-2 was improved by adding a layshaft brake to allow gear selection while the engine was running. This version was installed on cars #1026 and 1042 only. The R-3 version had further improvements including a centrifugal clutch to help shifting between forward and reverse even further, and may have been destined for car #1048 for further testing.\nBecause the external torque converter on the Tuckermatic made the engine-transmission unit longer, the fuel tank in the Tucker 48 had to be moved from behind the rear seat to in front of the dashboard for all Tuckers from car #1026 forward, even though only two of them actually had the Tuckermatic installed. This had the added advantage of improving weight distribution in the car.\nOther drives contemplated.\nA Borg-Warner based, 3-speed automatic was supposedly tested and was installed on car #1048 at some point when the company was in business, although no histories written ever mentioned such a drive. That said, Tucker ultimately wanted to design his own transmission for the final car, which came to fruition with the Tuckermatic. In 1949, #1048 was sold at the receivership auction without a transmission installed. Today, #1048 has the 4 speed pre-selector transmission that was used on all but two of the original 50 pilot models. It is likely this transmission was privately installed after the auction, and that the unit was the Ypsilanti-built Y-1 transmission.\nSuspension and body.\nSuspension designs, especially the front suspension, had to be changed throughout development. Rather than steel springs, Tucker used an elastomeric (rubber) 4-wheel independent suspension similar to what was used on the race cars he developed with Harry Miller at the Indianapolis 500. The rubber elastomers were developed with assistance from the Firestone Tire Company and used a special vulcanization process to produce a specific spring rate.\nTucker's suspension designs were plagued with severe stiffness throughout development, which, while good for handling, caused front-wheel corner lift when cornering on uneven surfaces. The test bed and the prototype had a double-rubber disc type front and rear suspension, similar to Miller's race cars, which was too weak for the weight of a passenger car. On cars #1001 and 1002 the rear wheels could not be removed without removing the fender or suspension due to the stiffness of the suspension and the rear wheel arch fender design. From car #1003 on, the rear fender shape was changed so the tire could be removed easily. Aside from the fender changes, the rear suspension remained the same from car #1001 on.\nThree versions of the front suspension were installed in the cars (aside from the rubber-disc style used on the prototype). Cars #1001\u20131002 used a rubber torsion tube design, which suffered from severe toe-in during heavy braking. Tucker then switched to a rubber sandwich type suspension (with a rubber block sandwiched between the upper and lower A-arms) on cars #1003\u20131025, however, this type was severely stiff. Starting on car #1026, Tucker finally settled on a suspension design with a modified version of the rubber torsion tube with the toe-in braking problem corrected.\nOriginal Tucker paint color codes:\nOriginal Tucker interior trim color codes:\nFunding and publicity.\nHaving raised $17,000,000 in a stock issue, one of the first speculative IPOs, Tucker needed more money to continue development of the car. He sold dealerships and distributorships throughout the country. Another money maker was the Tucker Accessories Program. In order to secure a spot on the Tucker waiting list, future buyers could purchase accessories, like seat covers, radio, and luggage, before their car was built. This brought in an additional $2,000,000.\nWith the final design in place, Preston Tucker took the pre-production cars on the road to show them in towns across the country. The cars were an instant success, with crowds gathering wherever they stopped. One report says Tucker was pulled over by a police officer intent on getting a better look at the car.\nTo prove the road-worthiness of his cars, Tucker and his engineers ran several cars at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in several endurance tests. During this testing, car #1027 was rolled three times at 95 miles per hour (153\u00a0km/h), and the driver (chief mechanic Eddie Offutt) walked away with just bruises. During the crash, the windshield popped out as designed, verifying Tucker's safety features were effective. Afterwards, upon replacing a damaged tire, the car started up and was driven off the track.\nSEC investigation and demise.\nOne of Tucker's most innovative business ideas caused trouble for the company. His Accessories Program raised funds by selling accessories before the car was even in production. After the war, demand for new cars was greater than dealers could supply and most dealers had waiting lists for new cars. Preference was given to returning veterans which meant that non-veterans were bumped down on the waiting lists indefinitely. Tucker's program allowed potential buyers who purchased Tucker accessories to obtain a guaranteed spot on the Tucker dealer waiting list for a Tucker 48 car.\nThis concept was investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney, and led to an indictment of company executives. Although all charges were eventually dropped, the negative publicity destroyed the company and halted production of the car.\nSpecific vehicles.\nThe first Tucker produced was a prototype sedan, known as the \"Tin Goose\". 58 frames and bodies were built at the factory. From these parts, 36 sedans were finished before the factory was closed. After the factory closed, but before liquidation of his assets, Tucker retained a core of employees who assembled an additional 14 sedans, for a total of 50. A 51st car was partially completed. A few of the remaining frames and bodies were built into complete cars specifically #1052 and #1057 (the 1949 prototype with design changes), but the fate of the others is unknown.\nIn the early 1950s, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, fairgrounds owner Nick Jenin purchased over ten Tuckers, the original Tucker testbed chassis, numerous Tucker parts, photos and documents. He developed a traveling display called \"The Fabulous Tuckers\". He hauled the cars and memorabilia around the country for nearly 10 years displaying them at fairgrounds and car shows. His display highlighted the questionable policies and SEC fraud investigation which brought Tucker down.\nWhen the cars appear at auction, which is rare, they command prices attained by only a few marquee cars. In August 2010, Tucker #1045 sold for $1.127\u00a0million, while Tucker #1043 went for $2.915\u00a0million at an auction in 2012. \nReplica vehicles.\nIn 1997, Rob Ida Automotive started work on a replica of the Tucker 48, which culminated in the release and marketing of the 2001 Ida Automotive New Tucker 48. This replica faithfully recreates the Tucker's external bodywork, but is built on a hotrod chassis with resin-infused plastic body panels. The paint and wheels reflect modern hotrod styling, and the interior is fully modernized. It is powered by a mid-mounted Cadillac Northstar V8. Its claimed performance is 0\u201360 in 7 seconds, with a top speed in excess of . Ida has built three Tucker replicas.\nNASCAR.\nTucker #1004 was briefly raced in the NASCAR Grand National series in the early 1950s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The 1988 movie \"\" is based on Tucker's spirit and the saga surrounding the car's production.\nEarly life (1903\u20131933).\nPreston Tucker was born on September 21, 1903, on a peppermint farm near Capac, Michigan. His father was a railroad engineer named Shirl Harvey Tucker (1880\u20131907), and his mother was Lucille Caroline (n\u00e9e Preston) Tucker (1881\u20131960). He grew up outside Detroit in the suburb of Lincoln Park, Michigan. Tucker was raised by his mother, a teacher, after his father died of appendicitis when Preston was three or four years old.\nFirst learning to drive at age 11, Tucker was obsessed with automobiles from an early age. At age 16, Preston Tucker began purchasing late model automobiles, repairing and refurbishing them to sell for a profit. He attended the Cass Technical High School in Detroit, but he quit school and landed a job as an office boy for the Cadillac Motor Company, where he used roller skates to make his rounds more efficiently. In 1922, young Tucker joined the Lincoln Park Police Department against the pleas of his mother, his interest stirred by his desire to drive and ride the fast, high-performance police cars and motorcycles. His mother had him removed from the LPPD, pointing out to police officials that at 19, he was below the department's minimum required age.\nTucker and his new wife, Vera, whom he married in 1923, then took over a six-month lease on a gas station near Lincoln Park, running the station together. Vera would run the station during the day while Preston worked on the Ford Motor Company assembly line. After the lease ran out, Tucker quit Ford and returned to the LPPD, but in his first winter back he was banned from driving police vehicles after using a blowtorch to cut a hole in the dashboard of a cruiser to allow engine heat to warm the cabin.\nDuring the last couple of months at the gas station, Tucker began selling Studebaker cars on the side. He met an automobile salesman, Michael Dulian, who later became sales manager for the Tucker Corporation. Dulian hired Tucker as a car salesman at his Detroit dealership. Tucker did very well, but the dealership was a long drive from his Lincoln Park home and so Tucker quit and briefly returned to the LPPD for the last time. A few months later, Dulian, still impressed with Tucker's immediate success as a salesman, invited Tucker to move south with him to Memphis, Tennessee, to work as a sales manager. Dulian was transferred a couple of years later, but Tucker stayed in Memphis and was a salesman for Ivor Schmidt (Stutz) and John T. Fisher Motor Company (Chrysler), where he became general sales manager. While managing Chrysler sales in Memphis, Tucker made a connection with Pierce-Arrow. In 1933, Tucker moved to Buffalo, New York, and became regional sales manager for Pierce-Arrow automobiles, but after only two years, he moved back to Detroit and worked as a Dodge salesman for Cass Motor Sales.\nAuto racing and the Indianapolis 500 (1932\u20131939).\nDuring the early 1930s, Tucker began an annual one-month trek to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Having a strong interest in the race cars and their designers, Tucker met Harry Miller, maker of more Indianapolis 500-winning engines than any other during this period. Tucker moved to Indianapolis to be closer to the racing car development scene and worked as the transportation manager for a beer distributor, overseeing the fleet of delivery trucks for the company.\nA better engineer than businessman, Miller declared bankruptcy in 1933 and was looking for new opportunities. Tucker persuaded Miller to join him in building race cars, and they formed \"Miller and Tucker, Inc.\" in 1935. The company's first job was building 10 souped-up Ford V-8 racers for Henry Ford. However, the time to develop and test the cars was insufficient, and the steering boxes on all entrants overheated and locked up, causing them to drop out of the race. The design was later perfected by privateers, with examples running at Indy through 1948. Miller and Tucker, Inc. continued race car development and various other ventures until Miller's death in 1943. Tucker was close friends with Miller and even helped Miller's widow pay for her husband's funeral costs. While working with Miller, Tucker met the Chevrolet brothers and chief mechanic/engineer John Eddie Offutt, who would later help Tucker develop and build the first prototype of the Tucker 48. Tucker's outgoing personality and his involvement at Indianapolis made him well known in the automotive industry by 1939.\nTucker Combat Car and the Tucker Gun Turret (1939\u20131941).\nIn late 1937, while recovering in an Indianapolis hospital from an appendectomy, Tucker was reading the news and, learning of looming war in Europe, he got the idea of developing a high-speed armored combat vehicle. In 1939, Tucker moved his family back to Michigan and bought a house and property in Ypsilanti. He remodeled an old barn on his property and began and operated a machine shop called the Ypsilanti Machine and Tool Company, planning to use the facility to develop various automotive products.\nOpportunity arose for Tucker from the Netherlands, whose government wanted a combat vehicle suited to the muddy Dutch terrain. Continuing his working relationship with Harry Miller, Tucker began designing the Tucker armored car, nicknamed the \"Tucker Tiger\", a short-wheelbase armored car powered by a Miller-modified Packard V-12 engine.\nAt least one prototype of the combat car was built. Production of the car was to be done at the Rahway, New Jersey, factory owned by the American Armament Corporation. The Germans invaded the Netherlands in the spring of 1940 before Tucker could complete the deal, and the Dutch government-in-exile lost interest, so he completed the prototypes and opted to try to sell the vehicle to the United States Armed Forces. The car is said to have reached 100\u00a0mph (161\u00a0km/h), far in excess of the design specifications. The U.S. military rejected the Combat Car, as they felt the vehicle was too fast, and had already committed to other combat vehicles. However, the highly mobile, power-operated gun turret featured on the Combat Car, the \"Tucker Turret\", earned the interest of the United States Navy. Harry Miller would later take some of the designs from the Tucker Combat Car to American Bantam, where he was involved in the development of the first Jeep.\nThe Tucker Turret was soon in production (initially at Tucker's Ypsilanti machine shop). Though the turret is often reported to have been used widely on bombers, like the B-17 and B-29, it was actually developed for the Douglas B-18 Bolo. In the end, no Tucker turrets were equipped on any bombers.\nTucker's patent and royalty rights were confiscated by the U.S. and Tucker was embroiled in lawsuits for years trying to recoup royalties for use of his patents on the turret.\nTucker Aviation Corporation and Higgins-Tucker Aviation (1941\u20131943).\nIn 1940, Tucker formed the Tucker Aviation Corporation, with the goal of manufacturing aircraft and marine engines. The corporation (Tucker's first) was initially based at his shop behind his Michigan home. A public corporation with stock certificates issued, Tucker raised enough to develop the design for a fighter aircraft, the Tucker XP-57, which earned the interest of the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC). Development of a single prototype of the XP-57 was started, powered by a straight 8-cylinder engine developed and influenced by Harry Miller, called the Miller L-510. Nicknamed the \"Peashooter\", this fighter competed for WWII government war contracts. However, financial problems within the company slowed the development of the prototype and the USAAC allowed the contract to lapse.\nDuring World War II, Tucker became associated with Andrew Jackson Higgins of Higgins Industries, builder of Liberty ships, PT boats, and landing craft. Higgins acquired Tucker Aviation Corporation in March 1942, and Tucker moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, to serve as a vice-president of Higgins Industries, specifically in charge of the Higgins-Tucker Aviation division. This entity was to produce gun turrets, armament, and engines for Higgins' torpedo boats. However, this relationship did not work out and Tucker severed his association with Higgins in 1943. Go referred to Preston Tucker as \"The world's greatest salesman. When he turns those big brown eyes on you, you'd better watch out!\"\nAfter 1943, Tucker moved back to Michigan, intending to start his own auto company, the Tucker Corporation.\nTucker Corporation and the 1948 Tucker Sedan (1944\u20131947).\nAfter the war, the public was ready for new car designs, but the Big Three automakers had not developed any new models since 1941, and were in no hurry to introduce them. That provided great opportunities for new small, independent automakers who could develop new cars more rapidly than the huge legacy automakers. Tucker saw his opportunity to develop and bring his \"car of tomorrow\" to market. Studebaker was first with an all-new postwar model, but Tucker took a different tack, designing a safety-oriented car with innovative features and modern styling.\nTucker's first design appeared in \"Science Illustrated\" magazine in December 1946, showing a futuristic version of the car with a hydraulic drive system designed by George Lawson, along with a photo of a 1/8 scale model blown up to appear full sized, titled the \"Torpedo on Wheels\". That was only an early rendering of the proposal, with its design features yet to meet reality, but the motoring public was now excited about the Tucker.\nTo finish the prototype design and get construction under way, Tucker hired famed stylist Alex Tremulis, previously of Auburn/Cord/Duesenberg, on December 24, 1946, and gave him just six days to finalize the design. On December 31, 1946, Tucker approved Tremulis's preliminary design. Tucker's future-car became known as the \"Tucker Torpedo\" from the first Lawson sketch; however, not desiring to bring to mind the horrors of WWII, Tucker quickly changed the name to the \"Tucker 48\". With Tremulis's design sketch, a full-page advertisement was run in March 1947 in many national newspapers claiming \"How 15 years of testing produced the car of the year\". Tucker said he had been thinking about the car for 15 years. The second advertisement described specifically many of the innovative features Tucker proposed for his car, many of which would not make it to the final car. This advertisement had the public very excited about this car, but Tucker had much work to do before a prototype was ready to be shown.\nTo finalize the design, Tucker hired the New York design firm J. Gordon Lippincott to create an alternate body. Only the front end and horizontal taillight bar designs were retained for the final car. A sports car variant of the Tucker 48, the Tucker Talisman, was sketched as well but never left the drawing board.\nTo diversify his corporation, Tucker imported Italian engineer Secondo Campini, who was well known and respected in the aviation industry. He was put in charge of pursuing a United States Air Force development contract, hoping to use Tucker's huge Chicago factory to someday build more than just cars. Campini and Tucker also began developing plans for a gas turbine-powered car to be produced by Tucker.\nThe Tucker Export Corporation was also formed, based in New York, which was established as an entity to manage worldwide sales of Tucker's cars. Headed by Tucker's long-time friend, Colombian Max Garavito, distributorships were set up internationally, including South America and South Africa.\nTucker assembled a group of automotive industry leaders for Tucker Corporation, including:\nFred Rockelman; Tucker VP and Sales Director (Formerly president of Plymouth)\nHanson Brown; Executive VP (Formerly VP for General Motors)\nKE Lyman; Development engineer (Formerly of Bendix Corporation and Borg-Warner)\nBen Parsons; Tucker engineering VP and chief engineer (International fuel injection expert)\nLee S. Treese; VP of manufacturing (Formerly a Ford executive)\nHerbert Morley; (Borg-Warner plant manager)\nRobert Pierce; VP and Treasurer (Formerly secretary of Briggs Manufacturing Company)\nTucker and his colleagues were able to obtain the largest factory building in the world, the Dodge Chicago Aircraft Engine Plant, which was later known as the Chicago Dodge Plant, from the War Assets Administration. The facility had previously been used to build the massive Wright R-3350 Cyclone engines for B-29 Superfortress aircraft during WWII. Tucker, thinking long-term, believed this large facility would fit his long-term goal of producing an entire line of Tucker automobiles under one roof.\nTucker signed the lease in July 1946, contingent on him raising $15 million in capital by March 1947. Tucker needed this money to get going, so he began raising money by selling dealership rights and floating a $20 million stock issue through the Chicago brokerage firm Floyd D. Cerf. With over $17 million in the bank by 1947, the Tucker Corporation was up and running.\nWhile Tucker ultimately got the plant, he was not able to move in until September 1947 because of delays caused by counter-claims and disputes over the plant between Tucker and the Lustron Corporation. That delayed Tucker by almost a year, during which time development of the car continued at his Michigan machine shop. Tucker planned for 60,000 cars a year, with 140 per day produced for the first 4 months and 300 per day produced afterward.\nTucker suffered another setback when his bids to obtain two steel mills to provide raw materials for his cars were rejected by the WAA under a shroud of questionable politics.\nTucker's specifications for his revolutionary car called for a rear engine, a low-RPM engine with hydraulic valves instead of a camshaft, fuel injection, direct-drive torque converters on each rear wheel (instead of a transmission), disc brakes, the location of all instruments within the diameter and reach of the steering wheel, a padded dashboard, self-sealing tubeless tires, independent springless suspension, a chassis that protected occupants in a side impact, a roll bar within the roof, a laminated windshield designed to pop out during an accident, and a center \"cyclops\" headlight which would turn when steering at angles greater than 10 degrees in order to improve visibility around corners during night driving.\nWhile most of those innovations made it to the final 51 prototypes, several were dropped for their cost and the lack of time to develop such mechanically-complicated designs. The low-RPM 589-cubic-inch engine, individual torque converters, mechanical fuel injection, and the disc brakes were all dropped during the design and testing phase.\nHaving run out of time to develop the 589-cubic-inch engine for the car, Tucker ultimately settled on a modified Franklin O-335 aircraft engine. He liked the engine so much he purchased its manufacturer, Aircooled Motors in New York, for $1.8 million in 1947, securing a guaranteed engine supply for his car.\nTurmoil surrounding Tucker Corporation (1946\u20131948).\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission bothered the Tucker Corporation from its earliest days. The SEC was embittered after small automaker Kaiser-Frazer was given millions of dollars in grants towards development of a new car, and subsequently squandered the money. While Tucker took no money from the federal government, small upstart automakers were under intense SEC scrutiny, and Tucker was no exception.\nOne of Tucker's most innovative business ideas caused the most trouble for the company and was used by the SEC to spark its formal investigation. His Accessories Program raised funds by selling accessories before the car was even in production. Potential buyers who purchased Tucker accessories were guaranteed a spot on the dealer waiting list for a Tucker '48 car. Tucker also began selling dealerships before the car was ready for production, and at the time of the trial had sold over 2,000 dealerships nationwide at a price of $7,500 to nearly $30,000 each.\nFeeling pressure from the SEC, Harry Aubrey Toulmin Jr., the chairman of the Tucker board of directors, resigned and wrote a letter to the SEC on September 26, 1947, in an attempt to distance himself from the company. In the letter, Toulmin indicated that he quit \"because of the manner in which Preston Tucker is using the funds obtained from the public through sale of stock.\" Describing Tucker as \"a tall, dark, delightful, but inexperienced boy\", Toulmin added that the Tucker 48 \"does not actually run, it just goes 'goose-geese'\" and \"I don't know if it can back up.\" In reply, Tucker claimed that he had asked Toulmin to resign \"to make way for a prominent man now active in the automobile industry\"\u2014himself.\nIn late 1947, a radio segment on Tucker by popular journalist Drew Pearson criticized the Tucker 48, calling it the \"tin goose\" (referring to Howard Hughes' Hughes H-4 Hercules, nicknamed the \"Spruce Goose\") and noting that the first prototype \"could not even back up\". The first prototype lacked a reverse gear because Tucker had not had time to finish the direct torque drive by the time of the car's unveiling. This was corrected in the final driveline, but the public damage was done and a negative media feeding frenzy resulted. Tucker responded by publishing a full-page advertisement in many national newspapers with \"an open letter to the automobile industry\" wherein he subtly hinted that his efforts to build the cars were being stymied by politics and an SEC conspiracy. Nonetheless, dealership owners began filing lawsuits to recover their money, and Tucker's stock value plummeted.\nSEC trial and demise of the Tucker Corporation (1949\u20131950).\nIn 1949, Tucker surrendered his corporate records to the SEC. United States Attorney Otto Kerner Jr. began a grand jury investigation in February 1949. On March 3, a federal judge handed control of the Tucker Corporation over to Aaron J. Colnon and John H. Schatz. Soon thereafter on June 10, Tucker and six other Tucker Corporation executives were indicted on 25 counts of mail fraud, five counts of violations of SEC regulations, and one count of conspiracy to defraud. The indictment included Tucker, 46; Harold A. Karsten, 58, \"alias Abe Karatz\"; Floyd D. Cerf, 61 (whose firm had handled the stock offering); Robert Pierce, 63; Fred Rockelman, 64; Mitchell W. Dulian, 50, Tucker sales manager; Otis Radford, 42, Tucker Corporation comptroller; and Cliff Knoble, 42, Tucker advertising manager.\nTucker publicly called the charges \"silly and ridiculous\" and hailed the indictment as \"an opportunity to explain our side of the story\". Tucker and his colleagues' defense was handled by a team of attorneys led by William T. Kirby.\nAnother publication, \"Collier's\", ran an article critical of Tucker on June 25, 1949, which included leaked details of the SEC report (which was never released publicly). This article was reprinted in \"Reader's Digest\" as well, expanding the scope of the negative press concerning Preston Tucker.\nThe trial began on October 4, 1949, presided over by Judge Walter J. LaBuy. Tucker Corporation's factory was closed on the very same day. At that point, only 37 Tucker 48s had been built. A corps of 300 loyal employees returned to the factory (some without pay) and finished assembly of another 13 cars for a total production of 50 cars (not including the prototype).\nAt trial, the government contended that Tucker never intended to produce a car. Throughout the trial, the SEC report on Tucker was classified as \"secret\" and Tucker's attorneys were never allowed to view or read it, but it was leaked to the press nevertheless.\nAs the trial proceeded, the government and SEC brought several witnesses (mostly former Tucker employees) to highlight the rudimentary methods used by Tucker to develop the car; the early suspensions were installed three times before they worked, and early parts were taken from junkyards to build the prototype. Answering back in Tucker's defense, designer Alex Tremulis testified that it was common industry practice to use old car parts for prototype builds, and pointed out this had been done when he was involved with developing the 1942 Oldsmobile under General Motors.\nTucker Vice President Lee Treese testified that Tucker's metal stamping and parts fabrication operations were 90% ready to mass-produce the car by June 1948 and that outside interference had slowed the final preparations for production. This back and forth between the prosecution and the defense continued until November 8, 1949, when the judge demanded the SEC prosecutors \"get down to the meat of the case and start proving the conspiracy charge.\"\nDefense attorney Kirby directed attention to automaker Kaiser-Frazer, pointing out that early models of their government-funded new car model had been made of wood and that when this project failed, Kirby stated in court documents that \"Kaiser-Frazer didn't get indicted, and they got 44 million dollars in loans from the government, didn't they?\" All told Kaiser-Frazer had received nearly $200 million in government grants, but did not produce the car they promised.\nAfter a break for Christmas, the trial resumed in January 1950. The government's star witness, Daniel J. Ehlenz, a former Tucker dealership owner and distributor from St. Paul, Minnesota, testified that he had lost $28,000 in his investment in the Tucker Corporation. However, on cross-examination, the defense used this witness to their advantage when Ehlenz testified that he still drove his Tucker 48 given to him by Tucker, and that the car had on it and still cruised smoothly at .\nThe tide turned in Tucker's favor when the government called its final witness, SEC accountant Joseph Turnbull, who testified that Tucker had taken in over $28 million and spent less than one-seventh of it on research and development of the car. He stated that Tucker had taken over $500,000 of the investors' money for himself, but never delivered a production car. Kirby rebutted Turnbull's claims on cross-examination, asking for proof of the allegations of financial mismanagement from Tucker's seized financial records. Turnbull was unable to offer such evidence. In closing his witness testimony, Kirby asked Turnbull, \"You are not here suggesting these figures are figures of monies taken fraudulently, are you?\" Turnbull's answer was, \"Not exactly, no.\"\nAfter this final SEC witness, Tucker's defense attorneys surprised everyone by refusing to call any witnesses to the stand. Defense attorney Daniel Glasser told the court, \"It is impossible to present a defense when there has been no offense\". In his closing arguments, Kirby became tearful and emotionally told the jury to \"stop picking at the turkey\", and stated that Tucker \"either intended to cheat and that's all they intended to do or they tried in good faith to produce a car. The two are irreconcilable.\" He then invited the members of the jury to take a ride in one of the eight Tucker 48s parked in front of the courthouse before they made their decision.\nOn January 22, 1950, after 28 hours of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of \"not guilty\" on all counts for all accused. Tucker had prevailed at the trial, but the Tucker Corporation, now without a factory, buried in debt, and faced with numerous lawsuits from Tucker dealers that were angry about the production delays, was effectively no more.\nSpeculation and controversy surrounding the Tucker Corporation.\nDespite the outcome of the trial, speculation has continued with regard to the question of whether Tucker genuinely intended to produce a new car and bring it to market, or whether the entire enterprise was a sham, designed for the sole purpose of collecting funds from gullible investors. Tucker collectors of the Tucker Automobile Club of America have amassed over 400,000 drawings, blueprints, corporate documents, and letters which they believe suggest that Tucker was, in fact, developing the manufacturing process necessary to mass-produce the Tucker 48. They also point to the fact that by the time of the investigation, Tucker had hired over 1,900 employees, including teams of engineers and machinists. At the trial, the Tucker VP Lee Treese testified that they were 90% ready with industrial machinery at the Chicago plant to mass-produce the vehicle.\nLater life and death (1950\u20131956).\nPreston Tucker's reputation rebounded after the acquittal. His optimism was remarkable; after the trial was over, he was quoted as saying, \"Even Henry Ford failed the first time out.\" Tucker Corporation assets were auctioned off publicly in Chicago. One remaining Tucker 48 car was given to Preston Tucker, and another to his mother.\nIn the early 1950s, Tucker teamed up with investors from Brazil and auto designer Alexis de Sakhnoffsky to build a sports car called the Carioca. Tucker could not use the Tucker name for the car, as Peter Dun of Dun &amp; Bradstreet had purchased the rights to the name, and the Tucker Carioca was ultimately never developed.\nTucker's travels to Brazil were plagued by fatigue, and upon his return to the United States, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Tucker died from pneumonia as a complication of lung cancer on December 26, 1956, at the age of 53. He is buried at Michigan Memorial Park in Flat Rock, Michigan.\nLegacy.\nIn 1954, a group of investors tried to revive the Tucker Corporation by soliciting investors, mostly former Tucker distributors and dealer owners, for a new car. This effort was led by George A. Schmidt, former president of the Tucker Dealers Association. They developed sketches for a sleek 2-door convertible, but were unable to generate enough support to get it off the drawing board.\nTucker's defense attorney, William T. Kirby, later became Chairman of the Board of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.\nOtto Kerner Jr., the U.S. Attorney who had aggressively pursued the Tucker Corporation, was later convicted on 17 counts of bribery, conspiracy, perjury, and related charges for stock fraud in 1974. He was the first federal appellate judge in U.S. history to be jailed. Kerner was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $50,000.\nThe location of the former Tucker Corporation, 7401 S. Cicero Avenue in Chicago, became the corporate headquarters of Tootsie Roll Industries and the Ford City Mall (the building was owned for a time by Ford Motor Company). The building was so large that it was divided in two, with a large open area between the two resulting buildings.\nTucker's design concepts for the Tucker 48 included revolutionary ideas in car safety that helped formulate car safety standards. The Tucker family held on to Aircooled Motors until 1961, when it was sold to Aero Industries.\nThe remaining Tucker 48 cars are highly collectible, and examples in very good condition have commanded prices of up to $3 million each. Original stock certificates for Tucker Corporation common stock are valuable to collectors, and are worth more than when originally issued. Over 10,000 such stock certificates were personally signed by Preston Tucker, making these the most desirable.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located in the Balkans and has a rivalry with the fictional neighbouring country of Borduria. Syldavia is depicted in \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" (1938\u20131939), \"Destination Moon\" (1950), \"Explorers on the Moon\" (1952\u20131953, briefly), \"The Calculus Affair\" (1954\u20131956), and \"Tintin and the Lake of Sharks\" (1972), and is mentioned in \"Tintin and the Picaros\" (1975\u20131976).\nAccording to Harry Thompson's 2011 \"Tintin: Herg\u00e9 and Its Creation\", Syldavia \"was an idealised portrayal of central Europe between the wars \u2013\u00a0a benevolent monarchy, peaceful village life, sturdy peasants puffing on large pipes.\"\nHerg\u00e9 claimed that the country is heavily inspired by the real-world countries of both Albania and Montenegro, and may also be based on larger Balkan nations such as Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.\nOverview.\nSyldavia is a monarchy, ruled at the time of \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" by King Muskar XII. The capital is Klow, formerly Zileheroum, located at the confluence of the Moltus and Vladir Rivers (after Prague, which is on the Vltava River). Other cities named in the books are Niedzdrow, Istov, Dbrnouk, Douma, Tesznik, and Zlip. The population of Syldavia is 642,000 with 122,000 living in Klow, suggesting the country is similar in size to Montenegro. The national airline is Syldair and the official currency is the kh\u00f4r. One kh\u00f4r is subdivided into 100 paroe.\nThe people speak Syldavian, a language that looks and sounds Slavic but is mostly based on the West Germanic Marols dialect from Brussels. It is written in Cyrillic, but curiously, the Latin alphabet is used in medieval documents, and some of the Cyrillic letters used are a straight transcription from the Latin letters (e.g., \"sh\" is written \"\u0441\u0437\" -compare to Polish \"sz\"- rather than \"\u0448\").\nThe kingdom's motto is \" which Herg\u00e9 translates as \" \"Who rubs himself there gets stung\" (in fact, the motto of Nancy, from the Latin , referring to its emblem, the thistle; in the British edition, the translators rendered the motto \"If you gather Thistles, expect Prickles\"). The motto can also be interpreted as a Brussels dialect rendering of the Dutch phrase \"\" (\"Here I am, here I stay\").\nSyldavians seem to be fond of mineral water, which does not go down well with the whisky-drinking Captain Haddock, one of Tintin's travelling companions.\nThe exact location of Syldavia is not given in the comics, and nothing more is known than that it is located on the Balkan peninsula, bordering another fictional country Borduria, and that it has access to the sea. It is also mistaken for Greece in one instance, but explained as having very different local clothing. In \"Destination Moon\", the trail of the Syldavian-launched rocket points to a location north of the Danube. There are various inspirations for Syldavia. As Herg\u00e9 noted, the primary inspiration was Montenegro, but the country's history is modeled after many Balkan countries. Har Brok writes that Syldavia \"may have been modelled after a country like Romania or Yugoslavia\".\nSyldavia is also known for exporting violinists.\nHistory.\nThe region of Syldavia was inhabited by nomadic tribes of unknown origin until the 6th century, when it was overrun by Slavs. It was conquered in the 10th century by the Turks, who occupied the plains forcing the Slavs into the mountains (in reality, the Balkans were conquered in the 14th century). The modern Syldavia was formed in 1127 when a tribal chief called Hveghi defeated the Turkish conquerors at the battle of Zileheroum and took the name Muskar, ruling until 1168. Although he was a successful ruler, his son Muskar II was an inferior king as ruler. Borduria conquered the country during the reign of Muskar II in 1195 until Ottokar I (his real name and title being Baron Almaszout) drove them away in 1275.\nKing Ottokar IV became King in 1360. He took away the power of many upstart nobles. When an enemy, Baron Staszrvitch, claimed the Throne and attacked him with his sword, Ottokar struck him to the ground with his sceptre. The King then said the motto and decreed that the ruler of Syldavia must have hold on the sceptre, otherwise he would lose his authority, as it had saved his life. This custom had the power of law as late as 1939.\nIn 1939 Syldavia was nearly invaded by its neighbor Borduria, part of a plot to oust King Muskar XII. The sceptre was stolen in the hope that the king would abdicate. Tintin had a hand in defusing the situation by returning the sceptre just before St Vladmir's day. The Bordurians then announced they were withdrawing troops 15 miles from the borders. (The situation was very similar to that of Anschluss in Austria in 1938 though the conclusion was not the same.)\nKing Muskar XII is a keen motorist who drives himself with only an aide for escort and carries his own pistol for protection. He appears in elaborate hussar dress for court and public ceremonies and in a plainer uniform on other occasions. Muskar XII is an actual ruler rather than a constitutional monarch (see enlightened absolutism). He himself ordered his ministers and generals to make the moves necessary to prevent the coup and the invasion. King Muskar XII is married, but his queen's name is not known.\nThe king is notably absent from the other stories set in or involving Syldavia\u00a0\u2013 \"The Calculus Affair\" and \"Explorers on the Moon\". Both were set after World War II, at a time when the various Balkan monarchies providing models for the fictional Syldavia had been overthrown and their rulers exiled. It is not clear what form of government is in power in the post-war Syldavia.\nNational symbols.\nThe Syldavian achievement of arms is shown on the title page and page 62 of the \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" album. It would be blazoned heraldically as follows:\n\"Quarterly, first and fourth Or a pelican displayed sable, second and third gules two increscents in fess argent; for a crest, on a barred helmet affronty or, mantled azure doubled Or, the Royal Crown of Syldavia proper; behind the shield the Royal Sceptre of Syldavia and a sceptre of justice in saltire; the motto \"Eih bennek, eih blavek\" on a scroll below the shield, pendent therefrom the badge of the Order of the Golden Pelican.\"\nThe flag of Syldavia is seen on page 59 of King Ottokar's Sceptre, as the King's procession passes onlooking crowds. It appears to be identical to first and fourth quarter of the coat of arms, that being \"Or a pelican displayed sable\". The flag is seen earlier, flying on a toy castle, on page 44. A potential maritime ensign is seen on page 61, as Tintin and the detectives are piloted on a boat to a seaplane, on the back of it having a white flag with the words \"SYLDAVIA\" written in black.\nLanguage.\nIn their book (Casterman, 2004 ), Daniel Justens and Alain Pr\u00e9aux have documented how the Syldavian language is based on \"Marols\" or \"Marollien\", the dialect of the Marollen, a formerly working-class (though now trendy) quarter of Brussels. Marols, which Herg\u00e9 learnt from his grandmother, is a form of Dutch incorporating many words of French origin as well as a sprinkling of Spanish. Syldavian seems to incorporate features of various Central European languages into the Marols foundation to suit Herg\u00e9's taste, such as German, Polish, Czech, and Hungarian. It is written both in Cyrillic and in Latin script, like Serbian.\nEducated Syldavians are shown speaking Tintin's language (French in the original). There is a hint that German is the predominant second language among the less educated, as in one scene when Haddock complains he is thirsty, a Syldavian soldier does not understand him until he yells \"\". At that time, German was the dominant lingua franca in Central and Eastern Europe, and Syldavians would be expected to have a better command of German than most other Central or Eastern Europeans, as their language is related to German.\nWithin the universe, the existence of the Germanic Syldavian language (and most likely Bordurian as well) may be explained as having been brought by the in-migration of German-speakers, such as the real-life Transylvanian Saxons and Danube Swabians, perhaps as part of the larger Ostsiedlung, but whose language diverged over a thousand years due to relative isolation from the rest of the Germanic-speaking world and contact with other groups, which is in fact not unlike how Romanian developed.\nCuisine.\nSyldavian cuisine appears to be typical of Eastern Europe; blini, herbs, sausage and garnish are seen in the kitchen of a Syldavian restaurant in \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\". Mineral water is an important export, and alcohol is scarce, much to Captain Haddock's disgust. When Haddock tries to bring in alcohol with him when visiting Calculus at the research facility, he is hit with high alcohol duty.\nIt is mentioned that a prime dish in the country is szlaszeck, described by a waiter as the hind leg of a young dog in a heavy Syldavian sauce. However, this may not be true as the waiter was deliberately attempting to disturb Tintin. Szlaszeck (apparently from Polish \"szasz\u0142yk\", \"shish kebab\") is served to Tintin with mushrooms and a salad.\nAtomic research.\nIn the 1950s Syldavia had a secret but successful space program in the area of Sbrodj (named Sprodj in the English edition).\nThe Sprodj Atomic Research Centre, seen in \"Destination Moon\" and \"Explorers on the Moon\", is located in Syldavia. The sprawling complex is located in the Zymylpathian Mountains of Syldavia (a play on the Carpathian Mountains), located close to rich deposits of uranium. The Centre is secretive and has very tightly-guarded security, including a large number of security checkpoints, helicopter surveillance, anti-aircraft artillery, and a squadron of fighter aircraft based at the facility. Work at the centre, carried out by a large team of international physicists recruited by the Syldavian government, involves research into protection from the effects of nuclear weapons and is the base for the Syldavian space program. The facility, which seems to be entirely self-sufficient, is administered by the Director, Mr. Baxter. The Sprodj Centre has its own atomic pile for processing uranium into plutonium and has vast facilities for the research and construction of the rocket-ship which carries Tintin and his colleagues to the Moon. The gargantuan complex is last seen at the end of \"Explorers on the Moon\" and is never again seen in the Tintin series.\nIn \"Destination Moon\", the Sprodj Atomic Research Centre invites Professor Calculus to head its space division, and later Tintin and Captain Haddock to be part of the Moon mission. In \"The Calculus Affair\", Syldavia's secret agents compete with archrival Bordurian agents to kidnap Professor Calculus and obtain the secrets to develop sound-based weapons.\nNational dance.\nThe Blushtika, meaning \"Goat Dance Twisting\", as seen in \"Tintin and the Lake of Sharks\".\nNational lake.\nThe national lake is \"Pollishoff\", meaning \"Lake of Sharks\". The inspiration for this lake seems to be various lakes in the southern Balkans, particularly the Ohrid, Skadar or Prespa.\nNational defence and ceremonial military units.\nBy 1930s standards Syldavia has a modern military, equipped with anti-aircraft guns and radar stations. It appears to have well prepared defensive systems with checkpoints and bunkers.\nThe army has an Eastern European appearance, possibly modeled on that of Poland or Czechoslovakia. The helmets used resemble those of Switzerland however. The uniforms have standing collars and rank indications are worn on the collar. The green-uniformed armed police or gendarmerie are stationed in both rural and urban areas.\nThe Royal Guard wear hussar uniforms, a style which originated in Eastern Europe. The ceremonial guards at the Royal Treasure House, Klow have elaborate costumes of traditional Balkan design and are armed with halberds.\nCapital.\nThe capital of Syldavia is Klow. The city was founded in the 10th century by the invading Turks and was then named Zileheroum. The Magyar nomads that lived there were forced to live in the Zmyhlpathernian mountains, while the Turks themselves settled in the newly founded city located in the lush hills. In the year 1127, the nomads, led by their chief Hveghi, defeated and drove away the Turkish conquerors. Hveghi took the name Muskar, meaning \"the brave\" and Zileheroum was renamed to Klow, meaning \"freetown\" from \"kloho\" (\"freedom\") and \"ow\" (\"town\"). In 1168, Muskar died and was succeeded by his son Muskar II. Muskar II, however, was weak, and the neighboring Bordurians took over the country.\nKlow has a wide variety of cultural styles. Mostly typical Yugoslavian, there are also many buildings of Austrian and Turkish appearance, for example, the old mosques. However, the Kropow castle's architecture and decoration are of Bohemian pattern, but this could be because of the fame of Czech architecture.\nAs a large and relatively well-off capital city, Klow has a large museum of natural science with mounted dinosaur skeletons. Klow is said to be the Capital of Mineral Water, and they are famous for their Klowaswa (Cyrillic: \u041a\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0432\u0430), their national mineral water, literally meaning \"Klow Water\" or \"Water from Klow\". In contrast to ordinary Syldavians, who use Cyrillic, the Royal Court in Klow uses the Latin alphabet.\nIn popular culture.\nThe song \"Sildavia\" from the Spanish group \"La Uni\u00f3n\" (\"Mil Siluetas\", 1984) mentions this country as a land of dreams. The Dutch group Flairck also has a song called \"Syldavian Waltz\", featured in their album \"The Emigrant\" (\"Syldavische wals\", \"De Emigrant\", 1989).\nSince the 1990s, Syldavia has inspired the creation of fictional Syldavian consulates by Tintin enthusiasts around the world. These artistic projects, parodying official diplomatic institutions, have appeared in various forms including websites, performances, and installations. Cities hosting such symbolic representations include Herstal (Belgium), Poitiers (France), Toronto (Canada), and Bangkok (Thailand). This phenomenon reflects the enduring cultural resonance of Herg\u00e9's fictional universe.\nOriginal stories.\nTintin stories featuring Syldavia:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "54553", "revid": "43066271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54553", "title": "Mnemosyne", "text": "Greek goddess of memory\nIn Greek mythology, Mnemosyne (; ) was one of the Titans, the children of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth). She was the goddess of memory and the mother of the nine Muses by Zeus. The name \"Mnemosyne\" is derived from the Greek word \"mn\u0113m\u0113\" ('remembrance, memory').\nFamily.\nA Titaness, Mnemosyne is the daughter of Uranus and Gaia. Mnemosyne became the mother of the nine Muses, fathered by her nephew, Zeus:\nHyginus in his \"Fabulae\" gives Mnemosyne a different parentage, where she was the daughter of Zeus and Clymene.\nMythology.\nIn Hesiod's \"Theogony\", kings and poets receive their powers of authoritative speech from their possession of Mnemosyne and their special relationship with the Muses.\nZeus, in the form of a mortal shepherd, slept together with Mnemosyne for nine consecutive nights, thus conceiving the nine Muses. Mnemosyne also presided over a pool in Hades, a counterpart to the river Lethe, according to a series of 4th-century BC Greek funerary inscriptions in dactylic hexameter. Dead souls drank from Lethe so they would not remember their past lives when reincarnated. In Orphism, the initiated were taught to instead drink from the Mnemosyne, the river of memory, which would stop the transmigration of the soul.\nAppearance in oral literature.\nAlthough she was categorized as one of the Titans in the \"Theogony\", Mnemosyne did not quite fit that distinction. Titans were hardly worshiped in Ancient Greece, and were thought of as so archaic as to belong to the ancient past. They resembled historical figures more than anything else. Mnemosyne, on the other hand, traditionally appeared in the first few lines of many oral epic poems\u200a\u2014she appears in both the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", among others\u2014as the speaker called upon her aid in accurately remembering and performing the poem they were about to recite. Mnemosyne is thought to have been given the distinction of \"Titan\" because memory was so important and basic to the oral culture of the Greeks that they deemed her one of the essential building blocks of civilization in their creation myth.\nLater, once written literature overtook the oral recitation of epics, Plato made reference in his \"Euthydemus\" to the older tradition of invoking Mnemosyne. The character Socrates prepares to recount a story and says \"\u1f65\u03c3\u03c4\u1fbd \u1f14\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03b5, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u03bf\u1f31 (275d) \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03af, \u03b4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u039c\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u039c\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9.\" which translates to \"Consequently, like the poets, I must needs begin my narrative with an invocation of the Muses and Memory\" (emphasis added). Aristophanes also harked back to the tradition in his play \"Lysistrata\" when a drunken Spartan ambassador invokes her name while prancing around pretending to be a bard from times of yore.\nCult.\nWhile not one of the most popular divinities, Mnemosyne was the subject of some minor worship in Ancient Greece. Statues of her are mentioned in the sanctuaries of other gods, and she was often depicted alongside her daughters the Muses. She was also worshipped in Lebadeia in Boeotia, at Mount Helicon in Boeotia, and in the cult of Asclepius.\nThere was a statue of Mnemosyne in the shrine of Dionysos at Athens, alongside the statues of the Muses, Zeus and Apollo, as well as a statue with her daughters the Muses in the Temple of Athena Alea. Pausanias described the worship of Mnemosyne in Lebadeia in Boeotia, where she played an important part in the oracular sanctuary of Trophonios: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Part of the rituals at the oracle of Trophonios (Trophonius) at Lebadeia, Boiotia (Boeotia):] He [the supplicant] is taken by the priests, not at once to the oracle, but to fountains of water very near to each other. Here he must drink water called the water of Lethe (Forgetfulness), that he may forget all that he has been thinking of hitherto, and afterwards he drinks of another water, the water of Mnemosyne (Memory), which causes him to remember what he sees after his descent ... After his ascent from [the oracle of] Trophonios the inquirer is again taken in hand by the priests, who set him upon a chair called the chair of Mnemosyne (Memory), which stands not far from the shrine, and they ask of him, when seated there, all he has seen or learned. After gaining this information they then entrust him to his relatives. These lift him, paralysed with terror and unconscious both of himself and of his surroundings, and carry him to the building where he lodged before with Tykhe (Tyche, Fortune) and the Daimon Agathon (Good Spirit). Afterwards, however, he will recover all his faculties, and the power to laugh will return to him.\nMnemosyne was also sometime regarded as being not the mother of the Muses but as one of them, and as such she was worshiped in the sanctuary of the Muses at Mount Helicon in Boeotia: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first to sacrifice on Helikon (Helicon) to the Mousai (Muses) and to call the mountain sacred to the Mousai were, they say, Ephialtes and Otos (Otus), who also founded Askra ... The sons of Aloeus held that the Mousai were three in number, and gave them the names Melete (Practice), Mneme (Memory), and Aoide (Aeode, Song). But they say that afterwards Pieros (Pierus), a Makedonian (Macedonian) ... came to Thespiae [in Boiotia] and established nine Mousai, changing their names to the present ones ... Mimnermos [epic poet C7th B.C.] ... says in the preface that the elder Mousai (Muses) are the daughters of Ouranos (Uranus), and that there are other and younger Mousai, children of Zeus.\nCult of Asclepius.\nMnemosyne was one of the deities worshiped in the cult of Asclepius that formed in Ancient Greece around the 5th century BC. Asclepius, a Greek hero and god of medicine, was said to have been able to cure maladies, and the cult incorporated a multitude of other Greek heroes and gods in its process of healing. The exact order of the offerings and prayers varied by location, and the supplicant often made an offering to Mnemosyne. After making an offering to Asclepius himself, in some locations, one last prayer was said to Mnemosyne as the supplicant moved to the holiest portion of the Asclepeion to incubate. The hope was that a prayer to Mnemosyne would help the supplicant remember any visions had while sleeping there.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
